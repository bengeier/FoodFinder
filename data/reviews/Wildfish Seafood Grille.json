{"text":"My husband and I tried Wildfish Seafood Grille during AZ Restaurant Week.  Upon first walking in, we were very impressed with the atmosphere and we were quickly seated at a very nice booth.  We are always looking for good seafood in the Phoenix area, so we were excited to try this restaurant. Our waiter provided excellent service and was very attentive (which was what the one star I gave was for). For AZ Restaurant Week, the meals are supposed to be either $33 or $44, and I believe most are $33.  However, it was $44 at this one, which brought our standards higher - we were expecting a fabulous meal, but what we got was only mediocre at best and not at all worth the price. We both ordered the Hong Kong style sea bass, based on the waiter stating that it was the best thing on the Restaurant Week menu.  However, it was noted on the menu that if you chose this particular entrée, there was an extra $10 charge.  I'm not sure why that would be...I had never seen an \"add on\" charge like this on a restaurant week menu. The Sea Bass was just OK and definitely NOT worth $54!!  At Chart House (which we love), they charge only $36 on their REGULAR menu for Chilean sea bass!  So how does Wildfish Seafood Grille justify charging $20 MORE during restaurant week, which is supposed to be more of a deal?!  I understand that you also get an appetizer and dessert for that price, but still, this was WAY overpriced.  Now IF it was to die for and the best sea bass we've ever had (or even 2nd or 3rd place), then I could say it was worth it and understand the cost.  We were expecting that kind of quality based on the waiter's recommendation.  But it was nowhere near that kind of quality.  The appetizer of salt and pepper shrimp was also average. The best part of the meal was the bread.  We will definitely not be going back here as we felt totally ripped off as we walked out."}
{"text":"We're not from here and looking for a restaurant with great food and ambiance and Wildfish was definitely It. Nice ambiance and great food. Service was excellent too. I'm used to eating at upscale restaurants and this did not disappoint. Nice but not stuffy. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"As my first experience at Wildfish I was completely blown away by the high-standards of service and amazing menu. We came with a party of 6 at 7:30 and were quickly sat in their spacious dining room within seconds... Everyone in our group was more than satisfied with the chicken, scallops, fish, and sides we shared. You can expect to pay a decent price for this type of meal but it still is on my mind a day after. Definitely worth a shot."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour and I have to say I loved everything I got including the oysters and soft shell crab :) two thumbs up"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  On the expensive side, but worth it for a nice evening on the town."}
{"text":"Great food. We especially enjoyed the crabcakes and pineapple up-side-down cake."}
{"text":"Sunday & Monday (as long as you sit in the correct area) has Happy HOUR all day!!! The food is phenomenal for being in Arizona where you're not close to water. I wondered where the fish was coming from exactly... Besides, that... Every time I go they're out of the Chilean Sea Bass and Lobster. Obviously, these must be delicious since they sellout by the time I get there around 9pm for dinner. I've indulged in the Ahi Tartar, the Crab Cake (1 of the best I've ever had), for an entree I've had Snapper and on another occasion I had the 10oz Filet. The spinach side dish is yummy as well. Ive also had the crab rice I believe it was which was not a disappointment either. I'll def be going back. -The DragonBerry Mojitos are delish!-"}
{"text":"I love this place. I would give them 4.5 stars if avail due to the slightly high price....but it does not keep me from going there whenever I am in town, hence the 5 stars. I love their happy hour....The staff is really good and the ambiance is my style!"}
{"text":"Wow , so blown  away by the bs happy hour menu . Was a long time LOCAL customer until tonight . Menu clearly states 2.00 off any wine on top of Happy Hour menu , until we got the bill . Bartender claims we ordered 7.00 wines , well thats all thats on the happy hour menu less 2.00 . Also got Phoenix magazine yesterday..in the Scottsdale dining section they have a write up about restaurant ..  It says..Grab a seat at the bar during Happy Hour and Oysters cost $1 each.. No one had a clue..Not sure who is running this place anymore , bartenders , manager just blamed it on management . Summer is hot in AZ..cater to the people who are here all year long ....."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the best  calamari we've ever had!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for Valentine's Day and it was a very enjoyable evening all around! We started with the Steak and Lobster appetizer with was excellent! For entrees, he had the Seafood Salad and I have the Swordfish. Both were wonderful and portion size was average for a fine dining restaurant. While we wouldn't rave about the service, we also have no complaints. The atmosphere was nice for a romantic Valentine's Day dinner. This was a special occasion meal for us and we would recommend it to others looking for fresh seafood in the valley."}
{"text":"Ohmygod, I just love this place. When you're out with friends Happy Hour at their Oyster Bar is perfect. It's a little crowded sometimes, but the prices are great! When you're having a sit down dinner, the setting is wonderful, dim lighting, great location. The food is amazing! Very fresh fish! My sister had a filet and said it was the best steak she has ever had. I've tried plenty from their menu here, my favorites so far are the Parmesan Lemon Crusted Sole,  and the Australian Lobster Tails. The sides are all great, and they have a good selection of desserts. Probably one of my restaurants downtown."}
{"text":"The happy hour is great.  half off appetizers and 5 dollar martinis? not only that but the service was amazing! My boyfriend and I ordered 5 appetizers between the two of us and the plates came out two at time. The minute we finished a batch, another 2 would come out in no time. My personal favorite was the crab cake.. and this is saying a lot since I live in Baltimore!  The drinks for 5 bucks..WERE STRONG! and they were really a drink and a half. The waitress leaves the shaker with you so you can pour the rest into your glass as it empties.   Also, the area around the place is great for walking around before or afterwards. Some cute boutiques and a wonderful plaza with waterfalls and a beautiful sunset."}
{"text":"I now declare this restaurant my absolute favorite. Great ambiance, dark and cool. And the food? Every time I've been here, the food has been incredible - so fresh, so tasty. They take care to beautifully plate things as well. Service ranges from good to outstanding. Last night hubby and I decided to have an intimate dinner here, celebrating our wedding anniversary. I happened to mention it as our appetizers were coming out, and the gentleman immediately returned with an anniversary card, signed by all, and sprinkled fresh rose petals all over the table. We were so impressed. The food was absolutely delicious. We ordered the Jumbo Lump Crab Cake, Maine Lobster Tacos (our favorite), and Truffled Mac and Cheese. SO GOOD. To top it all off, they treated us to a luscious Bananas Foster Cake with Butter Pecan ice cream, which they lit at the table. Thank you Wildfish Seafood Grille, for making our special night even more special! We remain loyal diners and will surely be back!"}
{"text":"We were in town visiting from San Francisco and searched for a seafood restaurant on yelp and found Wildfish...and are so glad we found it!  We are spoiled by good seafood in SF and my boyfriend and I both agree that Wildfish served some of the best seafood we've had!  We started with the seared ahi and the crispy salt and pepper shrimp...both were amazing!  Our entrees were the Chilean sea bass and the swordfish steak...again, both were fantastic!  We will be back for sure next time we are in town and we plan to go to the Newport Beach location next time we are down south!"}
{"text":"Disappointed in the food for the prices. Our crab cake starter was very good!! However, things seemed to go downhill from there. Maybe it was our bug eyed waitress that seemed to be on something, but if you're at a restaurant that serves $500 bottles of wine, I expect much more from my meal. The grouper was decent. The sauce on the halibut was good, but had it been served without the sauce it's unlikely we would have been impressed. Two gals in our group ordered the swordfish and it was tough, more like an over cooked chicken consistency. Needless to say, for four of us to have a $300+ bill, this food should have been much more stimulating."}
{"text":"Tried the \"All Lump\" crab cake after being assured it was as stated on the menu, no surprise....no lump to be found !!"}
{"text":"We had dinner there last night based on other reviews. It was so amazing that we did not want it to end. The place ,the servers, everything. Cant wait to go back. I don't know how anyone can say that the food was bad! I had the most amazing scallop dinner and side dishes. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Our Happy Hour Waitress was not friendly or attentive. I understand she might be busy, but there were a couple times where she raised her voices at other customers that made me uneasy.   Aside from unhappy waitress, their oyster on half shell was amazing. You can taste the ocean in your mouth. Crab cake was full of lumpy fresh crabs. Shrimp salad was not as amazing as described in the menu. Almost feel ripped off for the $14 shrimp salad with just two shrimps (and they weren't jumbo shrimp or anything...).   Though all items were happy hour menu, but our oyster, crab cake, and shrimp salad with one drink cost us $80 before tips.   Will go back again for oysters for sure, but will skip the salad and the drink for sure."}
{"text":"Great Drinks, app, dinner and desert was lite on fire. They meet your full expectations here for a finer dinning experience. Trust me you are going to have a smooth sailing experience and it's a wonderful great night grabbing a seat outside."}
{"text":"Dined here with my partner the other evening. Our experience was not the greatest. The hostess was professional and we were seated in a timley manner. Our waiter soon arrived with water and we placed our order. I ordered the Jumbo Lump Crab Cake Sautéed Maryland Style with Spicy Chive Remoulade  as my appitizer and the Georges Bank Scallops Sautéed with Citrus Fruit, Roasted Almonds and Brown Butter for my main course. My appetizer was first to arrive. The crab cake did not have a balanced temperature, the outside was hot, and the inside was cold, it also had parts of the shell in it. I didnt even finish the Crab Cake because in almost every bite there was a piece of shell. My Main course arrived and i was happy to see that the waiter made sure not to have almonds in it. The Scallops were delicious the fresh citrius fruit went perfect with it. The Scallops was the best part of my entire experience. My partner on the other hand had a dry chewy meal and was disappointed with the amount a vegetable put on the dish. If you state that there are greens beans in the dish we should be able to see the green beans and not have to pick thru the vegetables trying to figure out what is what.  When observing the floor we noticed that the waiters were not attentive to thier tables, I guess a football game is more important than thier guests.   The restraunt is very upscale the waiters are wearing formal clothing I thought that we would have been treated better.  I would go back for the scallops but not the service."}
{"text":"4.5 rating......Our best meal while we were in Arizona for the week.  Lobster tacos were excellent.  I had the scallops while hubby had Barramundi, both were top notch.  Great atmosphere, bartender was good.  Yes we had the pineapple upside down cake....Now I know why it gets such glowing reviews, its the rum!  This puppy had so much rum in it you could almost catch a buzz.  Very heavy, very sweet, and full of rum, wow.  Only food negative was the ceaser salad, it was down right not good because the dressing had no flavor.  Service was a little less than good.  We were there on a Thursday night and they were very crowded, with our waiter having a couple of larger parties he was waiting on as well, the service was not up where it should be for a place like this.  That said, we will return on our next trip!"}
{"text":"Pros: Phenomenal Halibut and Salmon dishes. Bartenders make some great drinks.Try the Dry Martini with Blue Cheese Stuffed Olives.   Cons: Felt like I was at a Social Security party. I think everyone at the bar was over 50, not including the 40 year old cougars."}
{"text":"The bread (crust) was excellent, Double Breast of Chicken (had legs ) too salty to eat; the ice cream sized scoop of Tuna Tartare with (tiny slivers) avocado, served with crackers tasted fresh. My (normally) favorite Chilean Sea Bass (Hong Style) steamed tasteless...  I had heard good reviews about Wildfish, a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorites have been here several times - have not had anything  I don't like.  Would go back just to have the Bananas Foster!!  Absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"For some reason I was always skeptical about this place.  But a group of us went this week and I was pleasantly surprised and will be back.  I had a hard time figuring out what to eat but finally went with two appetizers. I started with the steak and lobster tarter.  The beef had a touch of truffles (and oil) while the lobster was creamy.  It was served with toasted baguettes.  It was a satisfying appetizer.  For my dinner I had the crab cake.  The crab cake is 8 oz of goodness.  It was almost all crab ... very little filler and a crispy outside.    Everyone else was happy with their choices as well: another crab cake, lemon sole, chopped salad and seared ahi tuna w/soba noodle stir fry.   Only two of us ordered wine and the rest stuck to water but our waiter was fantastic. The service was flawless.  For desert I had a butterscotch panna cotta that was excellent.  It was served with two biscotti but they weren't worth eating.  Too dry for my taste."}
{"text":"Great Friday night dinner right at the mall. We had an eclectic choice of dishes: I chose the spicy tuna roll (good but not spectacular) and the pot stickers which were again, good but nothing to write home about. I added on a small order of crab fried rice which was unique and tasty. I loved the spicy kick that it had but my husband said it was too hot for him. My husband had lobster bisque with nice chunks of lobster which was excellent but very rich and therefore filling which meant he couldn't quite finish his trout (which was cooked to his specifications with lemon butter instead of barbecue sauce) and asparagus. Both of his dishes were good but the trout was just a hair undercooked (better than the reverse, for sure) and the asparagus was a bit tough one then ends. You got a lot of spears and a lot of rice in the small $5 side orders. The blackberry cobbler and pineapple upside down cake sounded so good but we had no room left for desert.   Overall, it was our best meal yet in the four that we have had on this trip so we plan to go back while we are here just to try those deserts. The $100 plus tip tab made it our most expensive meal so far but it included two glasses of good wine and it's the only place we really want to return to so I guess we got what we paid for. They have a large variety of menu selections and the service was classy and top notch."}
{"text":"I really loved this place, and will for sure go back! I loved that it was a great feel and that I could have a conversation across the table and not have to yell! Our waitress was very attentive and took great care of us, and the wine was yummy.  We split the pot stickers (excellent) and the calamari ( huge and also excellent), and then all got salads, which we were all super happy with... it was tons of food.   I will for sure go back when visiting...this place was really good!"}
{"text":"Upscale atmosphere, not too dark inside, really good fish entrees. My favorites were the shrimp appetizer, the seabass, the swordfish, and the Godiva chocolate dessert. The service was professional and truly excellent. Great for a special night out!"}
{"text":"I had very high expectations for this restaurant.  The atmosphere is wonderful, the service is more professional than any other seafood restaurant in the area (Drew was amazing), and the quality of the fish was fantastic.  So five stars, right?  Not quite.  They appeared to have thrown their lot in with the asian style of seasoning, but unfortunately for our tastes, they are a little heavy handed.  I couldn't really appreciate the taste of the fresh fish because the flavors added by the chef were so strong.  I really like Pacific Rim Cuisine, but for the prices on the menu, the balance should have been spot on.  I think they are just trying a little too hard to be interesting, but the recipes need a little more tweaking.  Don't get me wrong, I was very happy with the whole experience, and if I go back, I will probably choose to have the sauce on the side! Check it out and see what you think..."}
{"text":"I recommended this restaurant for our party of 6 last night for restaurant week.  I have been to Wildfish over a dozen times over the years for dinner, special occasions etc., and I always considered it a 5 star restaurant with consisently amazing food.  The service staff is occasionally snooty and not pleasant, but I still enjoyed the food so much that I overlooked it.  Last night I was so embarrased that I had selected Wildfish because the grouper had absolutely zero flavor, it had no taste and it was quite a narrow piece served over 6 asparagus, looking so naked on a huge plate with no garnish whatsoever.  Two of our group had this and I told the waiter it was tasteless and his response was that is was simply broiled and I said yes, we know that but it still tastes like nothing - literally, nothing.  He did not care at all, did not offer to change the dish or anything and my guests were entirely too polite to complain. The other guest ordered a filet mignon, pretty good tasting, but absolutely nothing else on the plate - just a lump of meat!  It was ridiculous.  They could have put something else, especially for prix-fixe, just anything, even a little frisee salad.  Then at the end of the meal it was as if the server wanted to \"turn the table\" and did not offer any after dinner drinks, coffee or anything.  I asked him if anyone at my table wanted any coffee and he said no they did not.  I found out later that they were not even asked.  I have since called the restaurant and I spoke with one of the managers who was somewhat apologetic and indicated that he would be speaking to the managing partner.  We will see.  They really need to make this right, if they can.  I am not holding my breath.    I won't return or recommend Wildfish any longer.  It used to be my favorite restaurant next to Vincent's (who is ALWAYS consistently good with very well trained wait staff).  Too bad they are not keeping up.  P.S. the photo of me that is displayed is at Wildfish about 5 years ago celebrating an anniversary."}
{"text":"Great service, above average food.  Definitely a dinner atmosphere more that the bar/restaurant scene."}
{"text":"The food was very good and the service was exceptional.  I made an reservation for 830pm on a Friday night and was seated right on time.  The waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu including specials.  Seafood was very fresh and prepared to my specifications.  Finally, the waiter was attentive enough to make sure we had everything we needed but never pushy or overbearing.   I would go gack again and try eating in the outdoor area.  Fun place to visit if you are vacationing in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"happy hour all night long during the summer! what a concept. hence the reason i find myself here at least once a week.  great martinis and actual quality happy hour food...items from their appetizer menu half off--did i mention all night long during the summer...sliced filet mignon ishiyaki that you get to grill up on your own mini hot rock, calamari with this divine citrus glaze, and this warm st. andre cheese that comes with divine little crostinis.  the atmosphere is great and the mix of people are pleasant as well...i highly recommend this for any occasion"}
{"text":"The food was fairly tasty; not exceptional, but the service was miserably slow for a group of 8. Over 90 minutes to our entrees after being seated."}
{"text":"Excellent service, good food, it may not be cheap but you definitely get your moneys worth."}
{"text":"As I look over my reviews, it seems I truly love something, or I truly do not.  My wife and I had originally decided upon going to the Salt Cellar in Scottsdale for our impromptu anniversary dinner (1 year married, 7 together, not a big deal).  For some reason, every time I drove past the Salt Cellar, I got this feeling that it was dated, or was better suited for a zombie apocalypse.  Normally, that would make me want to go there more, but I decided to spend my time perusing \"good\" seafood in Scottsdale.  Enter Wildfish.  My wife and I usually stick to within about 5-7 miles of home when it comes to eating out.  Not out of any other reason than laziness, and we know what we like.  For us to drive the 20 minutes south had better be worth it.   We arrived roughly 10 minutes prior to our reservation (6PM), and were seated immediately.  The table I reserved on opentable(.com) that morning and had requested a more private table if possible due to the nature of our dinner.  We got a corner booth (4 top) which was strategically placed away from traffic and eyes, with rose petals adorning the tabletop.    Our server (Ashley) was with us immediately.  She was professional,  attentive and exactly what we needed.  She had wonderful insight and fielded our questions with an adept intellect for foodies.  I had read online about their lobster tacos, and she echoed the sentiment that they were well worth the order, and if we were anything less than excited about them, she would replace them with something else.  With a recommendation like that, we ordered our first course.    They arrived, and it was hard to hold back digging in prior to taking the pictures (see attached).  They were flavorful, The compliment of flavors from the lobster, olives and sauce on a homemade tortilla were amaze-balls.  (It's a term)    Ashley timed her arrival perfectly and put in our order for our second course, Lobster Bisque.  This also was something I had read about online, and even though I'm not a lobster aficionado, I am a sucker for anyone saying \"best bisque I've ever had\".  I usually prefer to debunk such bold statements, but in this case I would have to acquiesce.  (Totally didn't look that word up on thesaurus.com)  I should mention my wife was drinking Louis Martini Cabernet Sauvignon, and myself with Makers and Diet.  Ashley was aware of our palates, and was spot on in recommendations for our main course.  Ali decided on the Swordfish steak, and myself with the Chilean Sea Bass, with a side of crab fried rice.  By this point, I was already full, but couldn't help but be excited for what was to come, not to mention Ashley had already informed us that our dessert was \"on her\" tonight due to our anniversary.    The main courses were delivered, and were just as everything else the night had eluded to, perfect.  I admit I could have eaten three courses of the crab fried rice and have been in heaven, but we couldn't find a flaw in the night, and that is impressive as we are critical curmudgeons.   All things being said, we're hard to please, and with my wife coming from the Jersey shore, myself from the Seattle area, we are always skeptical on seafood in Arizona, but no more.    I applaud the staff, management and our server Ashley who truly made a medium-expectation night turn into a gastronomic event.  We will definitely be coming back, so long as you never lose that fried rice!"}
{"text":"Very Nice ..Actually quite lovely indeed  ..we had the calamari and shrimp cocktail & lump crab so far soo very Good And they say we don't have Seafood in AZ...For Shame on them ...We have it going on..lol"}
{"text":"One Saturday evening my bf and I checked out Wildfish for the first time. It was late and had to get dinner before work so we were looking for something quick. We immediately got seats at the bar and were greeted by Jessie, the bartender. He was very helpful in choosing the wine to pair with the oysters and truffle mac & cheese. He also was very attentive and gave really great service. We ordered a dozen of oysters and they tasted like they came straight from the sea, so fresh! The truffle mac & cheese was soooo good! perfect balance between the truffle and cheese. Their manager Tommy was very hospitable and engaging. The restaurant is fine dining. The staff warms the place and are very hospitable. Working in the hospitality industry is sometimes like a curse cause you can't help but notice service defects and food quality. My experience so far in Arizona when it comes to hospitality has not been that great. There are a handful of places that I have been to that are up to par with service and food but Wildfish stood out among the rest. Superb amazing service and fresh seafood flown in daily. It may be a $$$ restaurant but it well worth visiting often if you want to enjoy fresh seafood with classic american dishes w/ a flare."}
{"text":"First time to try Wildfish. Very happy we did. Everything was excellent from the crab cake appetizer through the great entrees and finally the perfectly created sophisticated individually baked blackberry pie. Price is very reasonable give the outstanding quality. Went early 6pm to beat the crowd. Worked well. Reservations recommended"}
{"text":"If you are a seafood lover, you simply must try Wildfish in Scottsdale. I was an Eddie V's fan before discovering Wildfish (still a fan), and I was thrilled to find another Arizona seafood restaurant that gets it right.   I'll cut right to the best part - the Hong Kong style sea bass cannot be missed. I have dreams about this meal, it's that amazing. First, the fish is gorgeous. I've never seen a piece of fish so white and beautiful, I gasped when I lifted off the Asian-style plate cover and found such a sight. Next, the sea bass rests in a savory pool of soy and sherry broth that so perfectly compliments the fish's delicate and juicy texture that it seems almost too good to be true. I had this the first time on new years eve 2009. When I'm at Wildfish for dinner now, it's the only thing I order. Everything else is, of course, delicious, but the Hong Kong sea bass just can't be topped.  If you're stopping by Wildfish for lighter fare, make sure you're there during happy hour. I would venture to say that Wildfish has one of the best happy hours in the city, based on drink prices and food price and quality. Here are a few gems from the appetizer menu (I've tried them all):  - Chilled avocado and crab cocktail - Spicy shrimp and crab potstickers (another amazing broth moment) - Wildfish chopped salad  Order a few apps to share at happy hour and you're sure to have a great experience! If you're in the mood for something sweet to drink, give the blood orange margarita a shot!"}
{"text":"Wildfish is right off of Camelback Rd, around the corner from South Bridge in Scottsdale. The restaurant has a very modern and hip vibe that radiates from it. Diners are welcomed by a soft blue neon walkway to the front door and waterfall columns that frame the entrance. When you walk into the restaurant, the large bar area is front and center. It is sleek looking and has plenty of seating. The dining areas are on raised platforms on either side of the bar area that have both booths and tables. The place was pretty busy and as such, the noise level was pretty loud. We were seated at a table and at times I was having trouble hearing some of our conversation over the noise.   We opted to have some wine. The wine list has a nice selection and is broken into their \"regular list\", which is basically what most people will order from, and a \"special\" list where the entry price on the wine is $120+. The wine markup was about 2.5x retail across the board, which was not surprising for Scottsdale. There was not much worth drinking for under $45. We opted for a 2006 Newton Red Label Chardonnay that was $59. Very nice chard: supple, well rounded, and moderate oak.   Now for the food. Small plate offerings include soups, salads, appetizers, and selections from their raw bar. I walked past the raw bar and it is impressive. I was fighting a cold, so I didn't want to overload my immune system with raw seafood, otherwise I would have been all over it. Large plates consist of about a dozen seafood choices and then various poultry, lamb, and beef selections. We were all about the seafood that night. The sheer number of choices and their descriptions had us smitten as they all sounded so good. My girlfriend and I share food all the time and T wanted on board with that, too, so we decided to order a several items and share. While that may be great for us, it can be something a server cringes at, but our server never batted an eye. He was prompt, courteous, and VERY accommodating (more on this later).   I wanted the Lobster Bisque and we were told they would be happy to split that order into three smaller bowls as our starter. I spent 12 years in New England and the bisque was as good as any I ever had back east. Rich, without being too creamy with a nice spiciness and just the right amount of brandy in it. We each got a very large hunk of lobster in our portion, too.   Next, we all split the Wildfish Chopped Salad. They took a single order and split it across three plates (nice touch). The salad was very good, with large shrimp and chunks of Jonah Crab. The dressing was actually a mix of a vinaigrette (light flavored and yummy) and a green-goddess variety (kind of bland). They could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish, but it was still very good.   We ordered two main courses: Chilean Sea Bass Steamed Hong Kong Style and Gulf Snapper Filet Meuniere. We also got a side of Baby Bok Choi to go with the Sea Bass. I split the sea bass with my girlfriend (again, they split the order onto two plates for us) and it was exquisite. Light and flaky, yet moist. The sauce it came with was very light and mildly tangy. Highly recommended. The snapper was prepared with a brown butter sauce and was also very good. T was smiling the whole time while eating it, but was unable to finish the large portion, so that was destined to be her lunch the next day. The bok choi was served with macadamia nuts and a sesame based sauce. It really didn't do much for me as it seemed uninspired and a little overdone. It wasn't bad, but I doubt I'd order it again.   Since it was T's birthday, dinner would not be complete without dessert. Our server said any selection she wanted was on the house and she opted for the Pineapple Upside Down Cake (and three forks). I can't say that would have been my first choice, especially with some of the chocolate items on the menu, but it turned out to be a good call. There is no lack of rum in the cake and to top it off, they light some Bacardi 151 and drizzle the burning liquid on top of the dessert, which makes for a nice presentation. The cake was good, but the show stealer was the homemade butter pecan ice cream served with it.   You may have picked up on the fact that the service was top notch. We spent over three hours there and we were not rushed at all. He was on top of all our needs without being overbearing and it all added up to a great night out.   Final Take  Wildfish delivered in pretty much all the areas that matter. Aside from the loud environment and my very minor quibbles with some of the food preparation, it's definitely a place to go for a great seafood meal. I will be back there soon, if for nothing else than to tear my way through the raw bar."}
{"text":"I have been there about 10-20 times and can say that the consistency is superb! Food is amazing.....the best fish I've ever had in Arizona (next to manzanita inn in Sedona)! Definitely a dine-in place, and may be not exactly at 4:00pm when they open.....because initially they are a bit slower to get started! I would recommend making reservations if your party is bigger than two and planning on a relatively formal experience  (as formal as the wild-west gets ;-))  The calamari is fantastic! I would occasionally just pick it up for take out on sunday happy-hour and it never failed me!   The sea-bass is a must! And their desserts have enough variety to keep your eyes entertained!  Overall, if you are having an event regardless of the size and want consistency....this is the place! The fact that restaurants around them keep going out of business and they have been a dinner only place and standing strong attests to their caliber of food, service, and overall experience they offer."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere.  We ordered the seafood tower along with fish entries.  Delicious all around.  Would come back to this place again."}
{"text":"Mom had a birthday and we wanted to give her a treat. Wildfish Seafood Grille is a pretty restaurant. Our waiter was a little stuffy regarding help with a wine for the table. So we Bitch- Slapped him and he fell into line. Appetizer: calamari very very good. Crab cake not so. Mom and Sis had the Wa Steelhead Trout they were ok with it. Bro had the steak and enjoyed it. Little sister had a good salad and I really enjoyed  Grouper. I think we all enjoyed the Mac and Cheese side. A very good restaurant and excellent place to take Mom for that special birthday occasion."}
{"text":"Best seafood restaurant I have ever been to! Food was amazing our waiter Charlie was so personable and gave awesome food recommendations."}
{"text":"My wife and I dine out a lot.  We have always found Darden Restaurants to be above average and a reasonable value (Eddie V's, Capital Grill, Seasons 52).  Tonight was our first visit to Wildfish.  The decor is very pleasant, the food to kill for.  My wife had the seafood trio (crab legs, shrimp and scallops). I had Chilean Sea Bass.  My wife's was very good, mine was excellent, done in an Asian style, flavor out of the world.  As good as the food was, the service was among the best we have experienced in greater Phoenix.  Charlie was our waiter, gracious with a great sence of how much time to spend at the table without being intrusive.  If you haven't tried this restaurant it is a must.  We will return for second visit within the month"}
{"text":"Service a little slow but when I think about the quality it all came together. Great food! Ambience was great for two people, romantic dinner in a both. Menu it's mostly steamed, broiled and fried very little chargrilled items."}
{"text":"With thick pieces of feta, a combination of small and large black olives and hearty slices of tomato, the Greek salad at Wildfish was everything I had hoped for and more. It's easy to fill up on the salad alone, but don't.   Bring a small group of friends so you can try a medlee of flavors. I recommend the oysters and the delicious crab cakes. And the sorbet was refreshing, considering we popped in on a hot Wednesday evening. It was the perfect way to top off the meal."}
{"text":"The service was wonderful and the food tasted great.  The low rating is due to the fact that three members of our party of five had food poisoning.  I have been to this restaurant many times and this is the first time this has happened.  The manager was contacted and nothing resulted from this contact."}
{"text":"I'd say this is a very solid 4-star rating, and I'm a fan.  First of all, yay for AZ restaurant week! Why isn't this twice a year?   We came here for Happy Hour on Friday night, patio seating was perfect with the cooler weather and some people watching. The restaurant week menu caught our attention, especially the price!   So two of us decided to have one order of the restaurant week special, and then along with the jumbo crab cake, and of course some raw blue point oysters!  +The Blue point oysters were delicious!! Very fresh, smoother texture than the Pacific ones. Very similar to the ones we had at Mastro's  +Jumbo crab cake was big for HH price! Tasty and worth every penny!  + We shared the ahi tuna salad, the seafood cioppino and trio of crème brûlée out of the restaurant week menu. Tuna salad was excellent! It was an Asian fusion with the strong ginger flavor and I really like the tint of mango on top, gave the little sweet. Seafood cioppino was just ok, I've had much better ones, I don't like that they 'hide' a large piece of garlic bread underneath of the soup and seafood, why? The creme brulee was delish!! Three flavors (raspberry, cappuccino and orange creme) of mini creme brulee along with freshly baked biscotti, perfect ending!  +Green apple martini? Yes!  Overall it was a pleasant night, the service was very attentive, and definitely a nice night for patio!"}
{"text":"We visited Wildfish for the first time and brought a foodie friend who was visiting from CA. I noticed it took the server longer then usual to great us and get us set up with water. And we didn't have enough side plates. Minor stuff but noticeable. We ordered the scallop appetizer (a special) and the pot stickers. Both were really delicious.  I ordered the sole, which was good comfort food, but there was nothing special about it. It was well prepared. My fiance had the ahi steak, which was also well prepared and was quite tasty. What I will say is the prices are pretty high and while the quality of the food is also high, there is no \"wow factor\", nothing that stands out to me. The service is helpful and friendly, the ambiance is nice, the fish is fresh.....but there is nothing special or unique about the food here, which I expected for the price. Between the three of us we spent about $170 (not including gratuity). I will commend the waiter on bringing me a replacement glass of Pinot Noir and comping the first one I ordered b/c it was not to my liking. However, the second glass he recommended and I drank was double the price....All in all a good experience, but not really worth the high prices."}
{"text":"Very good seafood restaurant with nice patio dining. We went specifically to have the Chilean sea bass, which was steamed and really highlighted the fish. It was served with a miso broth which was unfortunately heavy on the soy. One diner had the fried oyster appetizer which was excellent. The Fiji apple salad was also a nice starter. Sides are meant to share which I always find vaguely annoying. We decided on the crab fried rice which was served with a generous amount of crab topping the rice. The rice itself was surprisingly very spicey and slightly oily. Dinner for 2 with two glasses of wine ran about $175. (Seabass is market priced)."}
{"text":"Our group of 4 arrived without a reservation on Mar 16.  We were seated quickly in a booth in the bar area.  They were busy and the initial service was slow.  The decor was attractive and the noise level moderate.  Drinks were as ordered.  The menu featured seafood but there were plenty of non-seafood items.  The wine list was inclusive and prices were in the usual range.  We all had 2 courses.  The salads were good, several had the caesar and were impressed.  They used a baby romaine which seemed to give a better flavor.  In addition the dressing was clearly home made and more oily and not the usual bottled sauce.  One of our group had the fish taco as the main and felt that it was done extremely well.  Other main courses were the baramundi, scallops and shrimp stuffed with crab.  All were very tasty and artfully displayed.  The bill was in the usual range for this type of restaurant.  We would recommend and return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Literally hours after my not-so-positive review of this establishment two years ago, I was contacted by a marketing representative of the company, who put me in direct contact with Damon, the GM of the Scottsdale location at which we had our unfortunate anniversary dinner. Not only did we speak at length about that what had occurred and he apologized profusely, he sent us a $50 gift card and told me to contact him next time we visited. To this day, it is by far the most amazing response I've ever had from a negative review. We were definitely going to give them another shot, they deserved it! However, the next time we visited was two years later--two weeks ago. (Yep, we still had the gift card.)  Called the night before to confirm our reservation and asked if Damon would be around the following evening, a Monday. I was told it was his days off were on Mondays and Tuesdays. Which was fine, I didn't want to make a big deal about it anyway after two years. Surprisingly, when we arrived the next night, he was there! Greeted us by name. Made sure we were comfortable. Checked in on us a couple of times. Did the man come in on Monday night just for us? (Dressed to the nines, I might add.) Never did find out, but I would like to think so.  We had a wonderful dinner outside on the front patio. Our server, Nico, a very nice young man, provided excellent service. Our appetizers and entrees were all seafood, which was ridiculously fresh. The sashimi and oysters were especially delicious. My martini was excellent. Can I just rave about the bread as well? Yum! It was a great night. All is forgiven, Damon & Wildfish Seafood Grille. Much appreciated, and you'll see us again!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more stars. It was so elegant. Fine dining at its best without the pretentiousness. My husband and I went here because we really wanted a nice seafood dinner but had a lazy day at the pool and didn't want to dress up. No problem. Very casual. We wore shorts and nice shirt. The staff was so great. Very welcoming and the manager combed the place the whole time we were there making sure everything was perfect. My husband had the Chilean sea bass and I had the Ahi tuna. I have to say we eat out 7 days a week and we agreed this is the best we have ever eaten. Large portions. The wine was exquisite and we thought so reasonable. $65 for a really nice Cabernet. The meal is a little expensive for some but we found $200 very reasonable for what we experienced. Loved it!!!!"}
{"text":"My entire party of 6 was very under impressed. I was especially disappointed with the lack of flavors on my and my husbands plates at over $30 each. Also the creme brûlée was still cold and the cookies served were probably a 2/10. If you want a nice dinner there are so many better places in Phoenix."}
{"text":"After passing this place on recent visits to Culinary Dropout and Olive and Ivy, my girlfriend and I finally decided to give Wildfish a try in our efforts to collect the whole Waterfront set.  We arrived around 8:30 on a Saturday night with reservations made on Opentable and were seated immediately with our choice of table or booth.  My first impression of our corner booth was that it was a little TOO dark, but no big deal.  Our server arrived quickly, gave us a choice of waters (I went with the standard hydrogen dioxide), and proceeded to be very pleasant and helpful throughout the evening.  My gf had a glass of wine and we ordered the crabcake appetizer, to which our server replied \"Good choice! That's my FAVORITE!\"  For entrees, my gf went with scallops and I narrowed it down to swordfish or an Australian fish whose name i can't remember.  I asked the server for her recommendation, and she said the Aussie fish was her FAVORITE! (2 for 2).  My fish came topped with crabmeat, a rich buttery sauce, and sliced grapes. The acidity of the grapes provided a nice counterpoint to the sauce, just as our server had promised.  I also tried my gf's scallops and they were some of the best I've ever had.  She agreed, giving them a very slight edge over Olive & Ivy's.  For dessert, we decided to split a creme brulee, which, amazingly, was ALSO our server's FAVORITE!  Wow, 3 for 3!  What are the odds??  Okay, the first two I was willing to give her, but when EVERYTHING i ordered was her FAVORITE THING ON THE MENU it started to feel a little disingenuous.  Maybe tone it down a notch.  Still, I can't knock the service. She did a great job, and I'd rather have fake than surly any day.  For 1 app, 2 entrees, 1 glass of wine, and 1 dessert, our tab topped out at $90.  Not cheap, but definitely reasonable for fresh seafood in the middle of a DESERT.  Overall, good experience and I'd say 4.5 stars.  They get the lucky roundup to 5."}
{"text":"Took my mom for her birthday tonight. Just moved here from nyc. I'm a great critic and a food expert ;)  Omg. Mom loved the seabass!!! I loved the strip steak . It was hugeeeee. Cooked perfect !! I shared it with my wife. All salads. Sides and dishes are like family style ..nice portions! Worth every penny. Best meal I think we ever had. The apple walnut salad yum! Ramone was our waiter' he was a perfect gentlemen. Very friendly and professional . Had us cut into steak to make sure up to pay prior to biting. They gave us a free vanilla ice cream and brownie cake in honor of mom's birthday which was awesome.i am going back!! I loved everything from the casual yet romantic setting to the bread, meal and coffee! It was perfect! Goooooo"}
{"text":"Went with my wife and WOW!  The crab cakes were terrific.  The steamed sea bass is one of the best dishes I have tasted.  The ahi entree was excellent as well.  The waitstaff was excellent as well.  Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Prices are high, but worth it. We took kids and they accommodated, even without a kids menu. You need to order sides separately, but they were probably the highlight of the meal thought the mains were excellent too. Nice wine list, and ambience. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"I really liked this place.  The calamari was a bit different than I'm used to.  Usually fried calamari you get some sort of dipping sauce, this one it was provided right on top with some other greens.  Was different, but pretty good once you got into the middle of the plate and the saucy part.  Both of us went with the Asian salmon.  Very tasty and the garnishments were also very good.  With the 2 meals, appetizer, and 6 martinis the total bill was still under 150.00 so I consider that pretty good value.  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Fantastic happy hour drink prices. They have several cocktail and wines at $5 glass.  During happy hour they also have special prices on appetizers and the tuna tartar and the lobster bisque are worth ordering, though lots of the food is really good. In fact, I recommend that rather than ordering entrees, you just share a few appetizers. Also, they really try to be accommodating-I went with my little brother and he was a huge pain and did't want anything on the menu so the server offered have the kitchen make chicken fingers and fries, which are not even on the menu. I had a great experience and will likely be back the next time I visit Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Took our teenage boys after a round of golf. The hostess was very accommodating as we has no reservation.  Had parmesan crusted sole. Chilean sea bass, red snapper with lump crab and lemon sauce, and seared tuna.  All fish was fresh and cooked perfectly. We had the beet with walnut side dish, heirloom tomatoe salad and truffle fries.   They have a great happy hour with apps and drink specials available only at the bar and would go back just for that .  Great atmosphere with lots of outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Great service and food... Get the potstickers!"}
{"text":"Amazing cocktails, extensive and tasty menu.   The fried oyster starter is out of this world.  My bride and I shared a wonderful valentine celebration and really enjoyed our evening."}
{"text":"Went to this place with my friend for some fresh oysters. Didn't realize the bread they serve is so amazing!!! The oysters were fantastic and after two, yes thats TWO, loafs of their awesome bread I was stuffed. Great place to visit, a little pricy but worth it for sure."}
{"text":"Michelle was a great server unfortunately my meal fell way short. Ordered the swordfish was told it was a \"steak\" and all seafood was 8oz portions. Was not even a  1/2 inch thick, wouldn't classify it as a steak by any means. Maybe 5-6 oz at best. If it was fresh  and has some taste I would have been happy. Unfortunately the desert was the best course I had there."}
{"text":"Great place, sat at bar where they had happy hour specials on drinks and apps until 7:00.  Crab cake fantastic, but the swordfish was the best I've had!  Can't describe it...just go taste it.    Going back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Shrimp was bad!!! I mean REALLY bad! Both my dish of a broiled version and the shrimp cocktail ordered by my wife. The smell alone was potent! The taste of rotten shrimp lingered in my mouth for hours. That nasty \"tin-like\" spoiled taste. Yuk! Literally had to spit it out Into my napkin.  We kindly presented our waiter with the problem however the manager came to our table to argue - absolutely rude. He suggested that his chef tasted our plates and that we were simply wrong. With that I offered to pay for our soft drinks and we left - never to return I might add. Gross $40. dish and shameful service for what is supposedly a touted seafood restaurant."}
{"text":"Went for Mother's Day Dinner and even with a reservation, waited about 20 minutes but the food was worth it.  Appetizer - Grilled Calamari- so tender and juicy.  You can't get that kind of tender meat without the squid being very fresh. Clam Chowder - Awesome  Entree - Sea Bass with - the fish was very fresh and good but it was not memorable. - amazing.  the fish was a little flavorless but the spicy and rich broth made up for it. best sea in the west coast ....  Dessert-  amazing  too"}
{"text":"The bartender is Eric and he is very personable. He makes a cucumber martini that refreshes the soul. He knows sports too. Great guy. Try the lobster tacos, they are so delicious. My new happy hour spot. Seriously."}
{"text":"AWESOME dining experience.  We stumbled into this place after being unable to get a table at several different Old Town restaurants.  The service was outstanding, the drinks were fantastic and every bite of our dinner was delicious.  Do not miss the opportunity to have dinner here!!!"}
{"text":"Wow.  I came to Wildfish because of the rave happy hour reviews, but I didn't quite know what it was going to be like.    What I discovered is that it's not bar food happy hour...it's real items on their menu, at great prices.  I ordered the lobster bisque for $5 (DELICIOUS, came with chunks of lobster meat and they poured the soup into the bowl right at our table) and 3 oysters for $0.75 each (large oysters, great accompanying sauces, and beautiful presentation).    That was all I got, but would have definitely kept ordering if I was hungrier.    4 stars just for how great the happy hour menu was.  I'd love to come back and try their dinner sometime too!"}
{"text":"Dined at Wildfish this past Wednesday. As usual, the overall experience was exceptional. Here are some quick thoughts on the positives (in no particular order):  1.) Happy hour runs till seven. Decent choice of wines priced at $5.00. The apps are great -- same serving size I believe as found on the dinner menu.  2.) I've always been struck by the greeting you receive upon entering the restaurant. Every staff member you run across, from managers to the hostesses, welcomes you. Why don't more establishments train their people to be as welcoming?  3.) Wildfish does a great job for gluten free diners. Both my wife and daughter have Celiac Disease. The staff here does not \"guess\" as to what might be gluten free.  4.) We had Eric again as our waiter. Ask for him when you visit -- you won't be disappointed.  Five stars. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Attempted to stop by here along my regular bike ride into Scottsdale.   I was not able to eat here so this review is based solely upon the Manager of the this restaurant.   I arrived at the restaurant about 9:30PM on a Saturday evening.   The place was about 25 percent at capacity with no one at the bar.  Also there were only two parties sitting on the patio off the the right side.  One of the waiters told me it was okay to park my bicycle off to the one side of the patio as it was not being used.  This was a good spot as the space was not being used and the bike would have been out of sight and out of mind to any customer.  Note, that my bicycle value is in the high four figures with other equipment and bags attached on it.  Locking the bike far down the street was not something I was going to do.  I returned back to the front door unable to located the first waiter who told me I can part my bike on the front patio.  I asked a second waiter to help me locate the first waiter.  I waited 15 minutes and he never returned.  I then spoke to the hostess about where to put the bike so I can eat dinner there.  At this time, she retrieved her manager who approached me in his suit and tie.  He than informed me that I need to use the bike rack down the street.  I informed him that I do not have a lock  - and before I can finish my sentence, he looked up and down at me, sizing me up, said promptly stated, \" I can't help you.\"  He then smugly turned and walked away without even looking me in the eye.  I then left.  Folks, this restaurant is located in what is called the Scottsdale Waterfront which has over 25 restaurants within short walking distance, even for fish.  Entrees are in the $40 - $50+ range.  I suppose with prices like that there is a tendency to judge customers (I rode a bike there wearing a polo shirt, shorts and bike shoes) and dish out (pun definitely intended) heaps of snobbery and attitude towards people who do not fit your customer mold.  This is a big mistake because in my pocket was green in which I was going to leave some of it behind for them.  But, no longer.  In the event management reads this review I will leave them the following \"Business Lesson.\"  If someone rides a bicycle to your food perpetration service establishment....they probably live in close proximity to your place of business.  That being the case, its probably best not to turn your nose up at them.   Fact is, I do live in Scottsdale, full time I may add, and this is what occurred.  No matter how good the food is respect for the customer is paramount.  Behavior like this will only damage your market.   I will no longer be bringing family here.  I will no longer be bring any guests here.  I will no longer be bringing any clients here.  In my office, we have a list of restaurant suggestions, this one has been removed from that list."}
{"text":"We were looking for a special place to enjoy my husband's birthday.  I wanted to make this day special for him and we were not disappointed. He had the rib eye and I had the swordfish.  Both were excellent!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! My girlfriend and I go here to celebrate special occasions and the staff is so friendly. We sat at the bar last time and the bartender Jesse was so great. The happy hour menu was amazing too. $5 Mark West Pinot Noir! The manager was super friendly and came over to make sure we were doing okay. Great experience! Definitely recommend the calamari too!"}
{"text":"WILDFISH is my favorite restaurant in ALL of Scottsdale. ((my best secret date place too, all you ladies out there ;-)) After my experience Saturday Night, I had to post a RAVE review. The food is PHENOMENAL and i mean ALL of it. Great atmosphere, I just love this place. For a Sat- i recommend calling in advance (480-944-4040) -get a reservation and ask for TONY's section. He really is very wine knowledgeable, pleasant and respectful. So is the entire staff, for that matter. I always feel like a V.I.P.  I have to say, I love the Asian BBQ Salmon. It is truly an AMAZING gourmet dish for only $25!!! I always take my family and friends here when visiting from out of town because I want to experience the best overall dining experience while here in Scottsdale! We LOVE Wildfish!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was really not very good and very over priced for the quality. The service was good but just overall disappointed. I did my research here on Yelp so I was expecting so much more. The calamari appetizer was very good but the bread was just mediocre and both of our main courses were over cooked. My husband had the lobster tails and I had a grilled shrimp dish. First problem was that the menu did not list that the shrimp were topped with red onions, a huge problem for me! They make me very sick so I had to completely scrape all the crab stuffing off so that I could eat them. So I paid around $30 for over cooked grilled shrimp. My husband had two lobster tails so he gave me one and took some of my shrimp. I was excited to try his lobster but I didn't even finish it because it was rubbery. Our ticket was $140 for one appetizer, two main dishes and one shared side, one soda and one water. For that price I better be in love with my food!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Is all I can say! We hesitantly went here when a restaurant across the street was slammed. I am so glad we did!! Service was amazing, and the food..... Just unreal! I had the filet mignon with foie gras on top, it was phenomenal, prepared perfect, rare ofcourse! Thank you Wild Fish for being there!!!"}
{"text":"5 Stars for Happy hour!  They have a late night all summer happy hour menu which mimics the dinner menu. Jesse and Jamie are fantastic bartenders with A+ service!  Get the Crab cake, wedge, or seafood salad ti start, Everything is great here. Only downside is that this is not a place for eye candy so bring a chatty girlfriend or someone you can enjoy great food and convo with.  Definitely a place you can be comfortable sitting at the bar alone or with friends!"}
{"text":"This was our third visit so we are fans.  Our reservation was honored on time and we got the booth we requested.  We had a reasonably priced bottle of wine and the seafood was all very good. Our guests were impressed with the quality of food and service.  Prices were fair for our entres.  The only suggestion I have is for the restaurant pick up the valet charge as their sister restaurant does."}
{"text":"Only one star based on having to at least have one!  Long wait for main course  Ahi tuna was not good- fat strands throughout   Sea bass too expensive for the dish - just average  Waiter recommended the pineapple upside down cake- worst desert we ever had!  Didn't taste like the desert we have had many times!  Saturated in brown sugar rich sauce.  Will never go there again, we a recommendation from the Westin.  They will receive a review as well."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite thing about summer in Scottsdale is that restaurants and hotels get SUPER cheap and do every night happy hours. Literally, best Happy Hour in South Scottsdale, by far. I originally wanted to eat at Culinary Drop Out, but the line was long and I was STARVING. Went into Wildfish, because even though I had never eaten there, and was left without my Bible of Yelp, I took a chance since I had eaten at its North Scottsdale, Big Brother location, Eddie V's, dozens of times. The menu is very similar to Eddie V's, but I would say, a bit trendier. Me and my man had appetizers and I had a $5 Mojito, and it was delicious. I had ahi tuna tar tar, a green salad with shrimp, shrimp cocktail, and by far, the best calamari I had ever had. It was like, salty, sweet, crunchy, and had cashews on it. I couldn't tell if I was eating calamari, or a dessert! Go for Happy hour FOR SURE. Great atmosphere, too..."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our wedding anniversary. I let him choose the restaurant because I hadn't gotten him a gift and he did take me to the Josh Groban concert and dinner 3 nights before. I was initially disappointed because I am not fish person unless it is shellfish even though we had eaten here before and enjoyed it.  My disappointment went right out the window the moment we were seated.  They had asked when I made the reservations if it were a special occasion and I told them it was our anniversary. There was an anniversary card on the table with fresh rose petals strewn over the cloth. A real class act but it gets even better.   We both had the Maine lobster and shrimp bisque - very smooth and rich in flavor.  My husband had the Chilean Sea Bass which may make me say, I really do like fish other than shellfish. Cooked to perfection, generous portion and mild with a little crunch on the outside. I had the Jumbo white Gulf shrimp with Jonas crab meat which is where my problem came in because my palate does not tolerate pepper heat and generally I will ask even when something looks innocuous on the menu. I have had meals at other places where they decide to finish the dish with red pepper flakes and have ruined my whole meal since it is not mentioned anywhere.  Someone who likes heat would have loved it. When the waiter asked what we thought, I mentioned that I had made a big mistake and did I miss something on the menu. Apparently, it had some kind of chili oil on it.  I was not expecting anything, my bad, but the next thing we knew, the manager came over.  He offered to recook the meal without the oil but I had already eaten 3 shrimp and told him it was my bad, they could just wrap it and my hubby would eat the leftovers. Instead he said he would comp us a round of drinks.  Again, class act. In addition to the entrees, we ordered two small sides to split (plenty). We had spinach sauteed with garlic and Parmesan cheese plus the crab fried rice with scallions and mushrooms.  The rice was out of this world and the leftovers came home with the shrimp.  They gave us a choice of complimentary dessert to share and we choose the molten lava cake with vanilla ice cream.  I quickly took my half of the ice cream before my husband took it all.  The cake was absolutely decadent, oozing rich chocolate.  It needed the ice cream to cut it so I am glad I took my 1/2 right away.  Again, all in all great food and excellent customer service.  More places should follow this example.  The impression they left with us made me immediately say, \"I am going to yelp them and give them a 5.\"  Kudos to you Wildfish!!!"}
{"text":"Always liked this restaurant, and thought it was exceptional and worth the richer price.....but certainly not last night. Great server, friendly, efficient, throughout the evening. We each had a cocktail.  Neither were very good.  After tasting 1 of two types of oysters, we had to send them back. They tasted....wrong! They quickly agreed to exchange the bad ones, we offered to pay for the ones we sent back.  All good. Mgr came over abruptly asked if all was okay but didn't mention the oyster. We then waited 40 minutes for our entree.  No mention of reason. The swordfish, was little more than 1/4\" thick and overdone. The sauce, with crab was tasty. King crab legs were undersized. Overall too disappointing."}
{"text":"I have been going to wild fish on a weekly basis for over 4 years now. The food and the service have always been great. It's my favorite restaurant in Scottsdale. Everything on the menu is delicious and  of a good quality. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"How frustrating!!!! I wanted to love this place. The items on the menu sounded great. The atmosphere when we walked in was cozy, a definite upscale setting. We had a reservation for a large group, were seated right away no problem there. Immediately had waters for the table and some bread. Our server was great.   Unfortunately, the suggested meal I ordered was horrible! I was debating between the fillet Oscar style, and either a fish or seafood dish. After a suggestion by our waiter  I ended up ordering the Jumbo Gulf White Shrimp dish which is followed by the description \"grilled with lemon, garlic, and fresh Jonah crab\". By the way, this dish is $29.  I also ordered the crab and corn chowder. Damn the corn chowder was great. Rich, hot, and a good amount of crab. Sadly...my main dish was just awful. My first bite was dry and dry and more dry. I swear there was raw garlic and/or raw shallots on my plate and random crumbs of god knows what sprinkled over all of the shrimp. You would think that there would be a sauce on top of this dried grilled shrimp but there was not. How about a lemon butter sauce? No. I ate two shrimp off of my plate and quickly tried to give them away to everyone else but no one wanted them. This was one time I wish I had sent the plate back and ordered something different but that isn't usually how I roll. I regret that. Spending that much on a dinner for me usually means I liked my dish but this time I hated it. How I wish I sent it back.  The other end of the table had great looking dishes. They all ordered a steak dish. Ribeye, fillet, etc. All looked great and they all said it was delicious. Wish I was on that end.   Overpriced for what you get.   I won't be back,"}
{"text":"The All night happy hour is one of the BEST in the valley....the appetizers are great and a nice proportion.  DON'T MISS IT!!!"}
{"text":"We ate there, and I ordered a fish dish.  My date steak.  It was very over priced.  I also ordered oysters and did have indigestion afterwards.  Very unhappy with the upper management.  They did not seem to care. Very unprofessional and pretentious.  There are millions of other restaurants . . .  I will try them, so should you. I will never try them again.  Beware of the lack of how to run a business knowledge, and their sheer  lack of service. We were not happy nor would we refer this place to anyone.   Expensive over priced food Bad service Typical common interior design, nothing unique or awe striking.  Unprofessional upper management Pretentiousness for no logical reasoning,   Go else where!"}
{"text":"One of the best happy hour specials in the valley. I was amazed by the food, wanted to ask if they were kidding. $5 Martini? Sweet! $8 for Wagyu Beef on a hot stone? Ahi Tuna Tartare...beauty. Sadly, no gulf oysters for obvious reasons but everything else was amazing. There're doing the happy hour all night too,,,,I feel like a traitor but WOW"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been dining at Wildfish for the past 8 years. We discovered their Happy Hour through friends and were blown away by the deals they were offering.  Back then, you could get a dozen large Louisiana oysters for only $6!  Incredible.  Unfortunately, those prices have gone up a bit but not much.  Their crab cake is one of the best.  My wife is from Maryland and still to this day says that it is the best crab cake she has ever had.  The calamari is also very good.  Eating there outside of Happy Hour can be a pit pricey, but if you have the cash, it is the best seafood restaurant in Scottsdale (or Phoenix for that matter)."}
{"text":"i was there last saturday and i'm so glad that their summer happy hour is back!  if you're a lobster bisque & lump crab cake lover like me, you have to order these two things and dump that crab cake in that lobster bisque, you will NOT be disappointed.  did i mention they have $5 selected martinis?  definitely one of my favorite spots in old town, you should go there and check it out..."}
{"text":"Great food, and out standing service! I went there for valentines day and they made the night extra special"}
{"text":"Very disappointing.   Took awhile for service.  Wide variety of fish but fish and bread is all you get without an additional charge.  No salad included and had to pay extra for sides to make a meal.  Who just wants a piece of fish and bread for dinner.  We spent a little over $100 for just the 2 of us and only alcohol was 1 beer a piece.   Very overpriced but guess you are paying for the area where the restaurant is located.  Definitely will not go back. Can eat at red lobster and fish is just as good for half the price."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I happened upon this restaurant when we were in town for our annual spring training trip. We will def be back!   Our friend is vegetarian and even though it doesn't have some veg options ont he menu, the hostess kindly told us that the kitchen was able to work with her and offer some vegetarian suggestions. Score!  We all shared a mix of salads, pastas, appetizers and desserts... Seriously, we all fought over the last bites and we nearly licked the plates! Even the salad was amaze-innngg... It's tough to make an ordinary salad fantastically yummy and \"new.\"  Our waiter was incredible and very knowledgeable and the manager was just as kind when we told him how incredible the restaurant was.  We were so pleased with our experience. We are def fans and will be back for another girls night dinner! :)"}
{"text":"They said fresh seafood and it tasted like it came out of the garbage. Maybe they're catching it out of the creek or a canal. Can't believe they tried to poison me I told them only fresh seafood or it could be detrimental"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant, but to be honest, it let me down.  The wild mushroom and goat cheese salad was phenomenal.  From there it was downhill.  Great ambiance, though I think they are trying too hard to be a steakhouse.    Most importantly though...  Given it is a seafood restaurant, they sure didn't know how to cook my fish.  It was fried and oily (and was not marketed that way on the menu!)  I wanted something light and left feeling like I ate a ton of bricks.  My friend's scallops - she said they were \"okay\" and not better than that.  Oh, and the prices are set as if it were a steakhouse too. (Note: if it were, which it's not.)  Mediocre at best."}
{"text":"BBQ salmon and seared ahi tuna steak were divine. The heirloom tomato salad was left wanting, the tomatoes were mealy and almost flavorless.  It wont stop us from continuing to come.  Oh, the lemondrop (I think it's called) martini is fantastic!  I don't drink anything that tastes like alcohol... I just don't like the taste, they were smooth (as smooth as anything lemon gets that is) and it was easy to drink more than one."}
{"text":"Wildfish is one of the classy-ist restaurants in Scottsdale. They have superb cuisine and an extraordinary Happy Hour with fabulous cocktails !! Wildfish has Amazing creations and the service is great!. Manager is attentive and always on the ball.  Love this place. Highly recommend for a night out or even a happy hour adventure with your pals !"}
{"text":"Food was fine. Not outstanding. Prices a bit high for what the food is. Service was 5 star. Just ordering 2 entrees one side to share and 2 glasses of wine, bill was $140. Just mediocre for that price."}
{"text":"The food is simply delicious!   I've eaten at Wildfish twice and I've been extremely happy with my meals and the service.  Eventually, I hope to sample everything on the menu.  Until then, I will recommend what I've tried thus far:  the Cashew Calamari is to-die-for!  I don't think it gets any better than this.  I really could have skipped my entree and just feasted on this appetizer alone.  Maybe next time?  Not to be outdone, the Chilean sea bass was cooked perfectly.  I believe it was simmered in some sort of broth.  It was moist and flavorful and not at all salty (big plus).  Wildfish makes a crab fried rice that is divine.  I've also tried the Wildfish Chopped salad which comes with an assortment of crab, shrimp and yummy vegetables.  For dessert (yes, I broke down), I recommend the pineapple upsidedown cake.  Talk about reviving an old-school classic!  It was served with a butter pecan ice cream, as well as whipped cream.  Wonderful!  Aside from the food, the service is always impeccable.  Both times I've visited, the general manager has made a point to stop by the table to ensure that everything is perfect.  The wait staff is attentive and helpful too, especially with questions about the extensive wine menu."}
{"text":"I came to Wildfish on a recommendation from others for my birthday dinner.  The experience was truly wonderful.  We started by ordering a bottle of wine.  Sometimes wine lists can be intimidating and servers can be pushy about which bottles you should order, but not here.  The wine list has everything from $40 bottles to $200 bottles and the server didn't push any on us.  We selected a white blend that we really enjoyed.  We started with shrimp cocktail and lobster bisque.  The shrimp were huge and really perfect.  They were served with sauces including an atomic horseradish and a lemon covered with a cheesecloth to prevent the seeds from getting out.  It's all about the details.    I ordered the swordfish which was served with an amazing sauce, crab, and avocado.  It was phenomenal.  My fiance ordered the chilean sea bass which was so fine it was served with chopsticks.  It literally melted in your mouth.  This was literally the best fish I've ever had.  It was absolutely incredible.    Wildfish is perfect for a romantic or special evening.  It was fantastic!"}
{"text":"The host staff and phone staff were so-so.  I recently organized a large family get-together and the other places we contacted in this range have such better customer service.  It seems as if Wildfish hires impish, primping high-school girls to answer the phone.  Not acceptable when their competitors in the seafood space all provide far superior service...  Ocean Prime, McCormick and Schmick's, etc."}
{"text":"I would have given Wildfish five stars but they have the tables so close to one another (because it is so popular) that I felt a bit crushed and hearing conversations was difficult at times.  The food is outstanding as was the service we received.  There were five of us all who ordered different entrees and all were very happy."}
{"text":"Had a section of appetizers for dinner. Was outstanding. Heirloom tomato salad. Fried oysters. Steak and lobster tartar. Very well done. Outstanding flavors and textures.    A very high recommendation."}
{"text":"What a great experience. We had the Ahi Tuna and the filet mignon. Both dishes had to be among the best we have ever had. The specialty cocktails were excellent and added to the total pleasure of the evening.  The ambiance gave off a relaxed vibe but you knew you were in \"good hands\" of the very personable wait staff with a complete knowledge of each of the dishes. Timing and presentation of the drinks and dishes were just perfect. We're heading back tonight to complete our enjoyment of a restaurant that does it right."}
{"text":"another winner!  Had a group of 6 that tried chowders, tartare, salads, rib eyes, swordfish, shrimp etc.  and their generous cocktail and wine list.  I cant say enough about the banana foster dessert and the godiva molten cake."}
{"text":"Had a not so good experience eating at this restaurant. I was disappointed in the dish that I ordered. It was the chicken breast dish with mushrooms and unfortunately the chicken tasted like rubber. I couldn't even eat half of it. I also wasn't crazy about the sauce it came with and there were hardly any mushrooms. In retrospect I should have sent it back and I certainly would have if our waiter would have come over to check on us once we got our food, which he did not do.   The truffle mac & cheese was supposed to be a chef signature side dish but it was a little lackluster, lacking in flavor and way too salty. In fact all the sides were lackluster. We had the broccolini and it had a non-compatible combo of perhaps some type of peppers and cheese. We also ordered the potatoes and they were just blah. Nothing to write home about. One person I was with ordered the chicken too and thought it was dry. The other person ordered a shrimp dish and his shrimp was overcooked.  Expected so much more because this is not a cheap restaurant but based on my service experience and the food quality I would definitely not come back.  Another table of four came in and ordered some drinks and wine and once they came, our table was ignored. It wasn't even that busy in the restaurant. It's 5:45 on a Monday night.   We waited quite a while for our check and when it came it wasn't split into three as we asked. We are all traveling on company business so we needed separate checks.  Conclusion: service and food quality don't match the high prices of this establishment. I expected a whole lot more..."}
{"text":"I have been here three times..and kind of just feel \"eh\" about the place.  I am a huge seafood lover...their food was ok.....but nothing that was super-exciting to me.  Good service though!! ......For the money....I'd prefer to go to Mastro's Ocean Club all the way for  their tasty seafood!!!"}
{"text":"This place was WORTH the 30minute taxi drive!   Everyone was really nice and helpful even with a big group like ours (like 15 of us). We started with the Chefs choice Sashimi platter which was amazing. I did think we would get a bit more Sashimi but as a starter it was good. Everyone at the table got something different and we shared. The flavors that everyone got were just perfect. I had the Sea Scallops and they were just perfect and melted in my mouth!   The best thing about the night was the desert menu. We ended up getting one of everything on the menu even though none of us could eat a bite more but they sounded so good! The best was the Lemon Meringue Pie. This was HANDS down the best Meringue I have EVER had.   Overall, wonderful place and will for sure go back when I am back in town!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Really terrific value. Drinks were excellent too. We sat near the bar so we did not get, maybe, the top service. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that services was not over the top good. It was very good, but not prefect. Excellent restaurant. If I lived in Scottsdale, I would go all the time."}
{"text":"About as good as seafood gets in Scottsdale.    Friendly staff, good scenery at the bar normally.   Excellent seafood.     Martinis are puny and overpriced, but this is Snottsdale......"}
{"text":"Well, since my last visit the prices have been raised and they changed the happy hour food deals. But they are not telling guests so we were a little surprised to get the bill and it was higher then we thought it should be. Instead of 1/2 price apps, it's now $5 off. But with the raised prices, it's no great savings. The food was still good, but there are other places that have better off-season specials just as good."}
{"text":"Went to Wildfish on a recommendation from a friend's father.  We started with two appetizers: shimp in a smoked cocktail sauce and raw oysters on the half-shell.  Both were excellent!  The horseraddish was the best I had ever tasted and the vinegar sauce served on the side with the oysters was to die for!  For the main course, we had the lobster tail and the sea bass, both market price items.  The lobster tails were done traditionally with a butter sauce and melted in your mouth.  The sea bass was centered on a lemon and white wine reduction sauce and was simply devine!    I would have awarded 5 stars, based on the excellent food, if it were not for the server's lack of mentioning the prices (listed at market value) as we ordered.  Also, the oyster appetizer ordered was not at the same price ($14) as listed in the menu, but this was not mentioned either (they were $35 on the bill).  The bill was quite a sticker shock that I am still catching my breath on.  So, prepare your stomach and tastebuds for some good eats, and your wallet, for a hard knock!"}
{"text":"Tried many things off the menu, including the truffle mc n cheese which was to die for.  Fish, and I tried a few different plates, were all incredible. I can't wait to go back to this place, it's one of my favorites ever! Unfortunately I'm a struggling college student and that may not happen any time soon...maybe they'll give me a free meal for this nice review ;)"}
{"text":"Wonderful seafood .. Service could be a bit better, but overall an excellent meal. The molten Godiva chocolate dessert is to dye for.."}
{"text":"Went back for a happy hour anniversary celebration. Enjoyed 3 dozen fresh oysters, lobster & shrimp bisque, crabcakes and excellent, attentive service by Amanda! Dessert for special occasions is complimentary (good to know)! This is still one of our favorite places in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Came here expecting to be wow'd and definitely was not let down. We were greeted by our server within 1 minute of being sat down. The crab cake was succulent, as were the oysters. The Chilean Sea bass was made Hong Kong style--which is quite tasty. However my favorite dish of the night was the bananas foster cake!"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic dinner here. It was our first time and wanted to try everything so we sampled... -crab cake appetizer -caesar and wedge salad - hong king style sea bass - bbq trout - crab fried rice - asparagus - truffled mac and cheese  The crab cake was more meat than filler. The crab in it tasted very fresh and the outside had a fantastic pan fried crunch. The salads were bigger than indicated by the waiter, we could have easily split one. The caesar had house made dressing and the leaves were fresh. The wedge was also perfectly crisp and covered in strong, delicious maytag blue cheese.  My husband absolutely loved his trout. The skin was perfectly crisp, the fish still moist and very flavorful. My hong kong sea bass was divine....a large piece of perfectly cooked bass in a light soy sauce served with ginger. I was surprised at how large both the portions were. I was expecting smaller considering we were in north scottsdale and this place isnt super cheap.  The sides were epic. I LOVE that they have the option to order a smaller sized side. I don't think I have ever had fried rice that good. The mac and cheese was creamy, the topping not drying it out. The asparagus was not overcooked. It was finished with a bit of sea salt and came with hollandaise saue. Everything was very flavorful. None of these dishes seemed to be treated as an afterthought...something thrown on the menu just because.   I took one star off because I was not a fan of their bar menu. The wine list had mostly very high priced bottles, very few options for wine by the glass. I had a cocktail and it was just ok. The hostesses were a little vacant as well. Which I can never understand...you are a restaurant hostess. You are not above being nice or smiling at people coming to eat at the restaurant you work in.   We did not try dessert due to how full we were. The food was flawless, waitstaff service outside the hostess struck that balance of present but not too present. We are planning to come back soon!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and both experiences have been very good.  It begins and ends with the service.  It is truly an art being able to provide excellent service while never intruding upon your dinner party.  Both wait persons were excellent.  For appetizers, the calamari is superb, and the crab cakes were excellent.  I had the Chilean sea bass, which is prepared Hong Kong style.  This was perhaps the best seafood dish I have ever had here in the valley.  I would give it 5 stars but it is very pricey.  Regardless, it's a great experience!"}
{"text":"Best fish joint in town. Worth every penny. Here is what I ate tonight:  Kettle One Martini Shaken on the Rocks - Great start  Sashimi Platter - BEST ahi tuna in the Valley, great poke, amazing marlin  Shrimp Cocktail - Perfect HUGE shrimp  Shrimp and Crab Chopped Salad - One of the best salads I've had in a while. Tons of shrimp and crab with blue cheese, walnuts, avocado  Onion Rings with Blue Cheese Fondue Sauce - Holy shit  Sole with lemon sauce  - yum  Crab Stuffed Shrimp - REALLY garlicky but still very good  Sautéed Spinach - perfect  Ice Cream Sundae with hot fudge - hells to the yeah  Cinnamon Apple Crisp with Ice Cream - Slice of heaven  Brandy-Cinnamon Bread Pudding - good  I ate ALL this and still want to go back for more. I've never had a bad meal here. 5 stars every single time."}
{"text":"This is my favorite seafood place in Phoenix!!!! I have loved this place since it opened when I worked at Nordstrom years ago!  They have a great happy hour.  There are not many places that you can get a $5 cosmo, appletini, and lemon drop martinis...not many!!  They are not Grey Goose martini but they are delicious all the same!  They offer greta choices from their menu on their happy hour menu as well...of course they have a fabulous happy hour its because its the same owner as Roaring Fork and their happy hour is to die for... Anyways...their menu... The potstickers are just something different that you would not expect...and they are delicious!  I love the crab cake too!  A guilty pleasure is the bacon wrapped shrimp with goat cheese and the onion rings!! OMG!!  I cannot get enough of the lobster tacos too!!  I could just have the appetizers for dinner!  I do often!  Also, I love the Fuji Apple Salad because the candied walnuts just make you want more and more and more...the dressing just tops it all off... Now the entrees that I love are the Crab stuffed shrimp with the vinaigrette...It is FABULOUS!!  Of course...if you love lobster tail this is the place to get it!  You get two of them!  Now make sure that it is the right season because they are not cheap, but they are so worth it! The sides to get are the twice baked potatoes, truffled mac and cheese, and sauteed spinach!  They are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Didn't have a great experience. The food was ehhh and our server didn't really didn't know what was happening. Asked how big the servings were her answered I really don't know, this is the first time we opened for brunch. I guess there was no stand up or he was late for the meeting.   With other options in the area definitely not coming back."}
{"text":"I had the giant scallops but tried my friend's Chilean sea bass steamed in miso (I think) an it was divine! The snap peas an portabello mushrooms were also very tasty. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"As a Marylander myself, I must tell you that this is one of my top 5 favorite seafood restaurants ever (including places in MD).  I had the crab and lobster bisque. It was too much for one to share but I had to take it back to my hotel with me.  It's been a while, but I believe I had salmon with shrimp and a sweet potato.  Scrumptious!   I barely are the salmon, probably took a bite and ate a shrimp or two because I was so full from bisque.  Ask if I cared?  Nope!  Wrapped that sucker up too!  Oh and let's not forget about the ambiance.. this place is gorgeous on the inside.  I'm so glad I had my work attire on because everyone else seemed to.  It was a Wednesday night by the way.    I'm going back to Phoenix in February had plan to do the same exact thing.  Shop across the street in that gorgeous mall and end my night with dinner and drinks at Wildfish :)"}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite, go-to happy hour spots. The food is excellent (and the oysters are a steal), the drinks are a great deal and the atmosphere is just right - not too loud, always bustling, low lighting, not too stuffy/Scottsdale-ish. Honestly, it's my fall back place when I just don't feel like trying to come up with an idea for happy hour, it's consistently good and the deals are some of the best around. If you haven't been, you're missing the boat.  Oh and if you like Wedge salads, you must try theirs...the dressing is...beyond. I've been dying to get the recipe for years now, if you manage to squeeze it out of someone, I'll be your best friend."}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale and was craving some oysters. Wanted to do a happy hour spot with oysters and found this restaurant. Their happy hour oyster prices are nothing to get excited about. Oysters were $2-$3 each for happy hour. But, they were amazing! Probably some of the best oysters I've had, and I'm from San Francisco where we have tons of oyster happy hour places to choose from. We had 2 dozen Blue Point oysters and ate every single one. They were served with a side of: horseradish, cocktail sauce and mignonette. We also got a side of bread and butter, which doesn't sound exciting, but was so good! Great quality bread! We sat at the bar which was pretty crowded, but we had great service. We only did the happy hour, so I cant speak to the rest of the food, but I highly recommend it for happy hour and oysters!!"}
{"text":"So, after my violently disappointing experience with the establishment next door my eyes immediately fell on this place. I would never have chosen this place myself, but in a dire need of a drink I walked in like a tenderfoot cowboy mistakenly draws attention through the saloon doors.   I will keep it short and sweet. Service - fantastic. Clientele (even if the establishment isn't outmost responsible for this) - outstanding. Drinks - great. Atmosphere - cozy.  I have almost no negatives at all. Well, since it is a seafood place there is a hint of shellfish smell in the whole place. Not enough for it to transfer to you as a patron, but it lingers.. and I assume it is to be expected... just not expected by me since I was a clueless walk-in.."}
{"text":"Top shelf.  Actually it is the best ribeye in Phoenix/Scottsdale !   And I eat at all of em routinely."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous in every way. The service was excellent. We had oysters, filet and shrimp surf and turf and the banana butter cake. Everything was magnificent. Also, the restaurant is dark and candle lit with booths for comfort. It is busy but not so loud u can't talk and have nice conversation. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Ordered the crab cake appetizer, parmesan sole, halibut and bananas foster for dessert.  By far, my favorite was the parmesan sole.  The sauce was very rich and flavorful and the fish perfectly prepared.  Everything was good, but the sole was excellent."}
{"text":"This is not an easy review to write without confusing the reader but let's give it a whirl. We ordered a 1/2 dozen oyster, which were great, especially the atomic horseradish sauce. Also, order the shrimp and pork pot stickers, which were flavorful but had just a little too salt in the broth for my taste. Finally, for appetizer we got the Hawaiian hamachi, which was good but just a little too salty Ponzu sauce.   Here is where it can get confusing. My wife ordered Florida Grouper and I got the scallop special, which was Nantucket scallops in a brown butter and almond sauce. What's confusing you say? They never came out. The G.M., Damon, came out and told us as honestly as he could that they forgot to get the order out.   Damon made sure we got our entrees as expeditiously as he could and they were comped. The way my wife and I see it is that not every meal will be perfect but if they make an attempt to rectify it that says something positive. Thanks Damon.   We will return!  PS. pineapple upside down cake is off the charts good!"}
{"text":"It's my birthday and we chose Wildfish for dinner. We are very please!  The food is GREAT!  The atmosphere is very mature and romantic. I love the service!  It's a dim yet beautifully decorated venue. It's casual yet sexy!  Great food. Great service!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"BBQ salmon.. Even though the ocean is so far away, the ocean seems next door.  Great service.  Everyone seems like they are at the beach, even though the wait staff might be dressed as if they are in NYC, there is a sense of class.  Get the calamari!"}
{"text":"Very delicious!!!!!!! Love it! It's little pricey, but its worthy it!  It's very romantic environment."}
{"text":"My seafood crisis began about 1.5 years ago when I moved to the land-locked state of Arizona. As a native San Franciscan, I couldn't come to terms with mediocre desert seafood. That is, until my bf Matt and I dined at Wildfish Seafood Grille for Restaurant Week.   Many AZ seafood spots strive to impress with elaborate décor, attempting to mask their mediocre food. Not Wildfish. Their ambiance and menu wowed me by encompassing all of my seafood eating requirements: FRESH sea creatures, delicious sides, impeccable service and a fancy but not stuffy atmosphere.     Neon lighting illuminates Wildfish's entrance and bar. Inside it's just dim enough to set the perfect mood. We arrived earlier than our reservation time so we sat at the bar for drinks. I ordered a mojito (of course) and to my delight it was pure minty refreshment. Bubbly and not too sweet, the bartender muddled it to perfection right before my eyes.   Post-drinks, we settled into a comfortable booth. Although the restaurant looked packed, every table was privately well spaced so it didn't feel crowded. Our waiter was professional, personable and not overbearing. He checked in just enough so I never looked around for him. He also allowed us to linger and enjoy each course. We never felt rushed.   For our appetizer we both ordered the Pacific Ahi Tuna Crudo, a dish similar to Ahi Carpaccio, and I can honestly say it's the best I've ever tasted. The dollop of radish salad in the center perfectly accented the chilled Ahi's raw and meaty taste.   My main course of Halibut was served over rice with a Mediterranean flavored sauce containing olives and tomatoes. After just one bite of that flaky, tender, perfectly seared and seasoned fish my seafood crisis came to a screeching halt - my mouth enthusiastically welcomed that mouthwatering fresh seafood taste!   Matt raved about his Seafood Cioppino, and after sampling it I could see why. Tons of succulent mussels, shrimp, scallops and crab pieces were tossed into a flavorful sauce and placed on top a piece of bread that soaked up all the juices.   We also ordered 2 amazingly tasty sides - spinach sautéed with olive oil and garlic, and crisp snap peas coupled with flavorful seared mushrooms. Hats off to the chef for creating vegetables with flair!   Dessert was delicious & decadent. My 3 crème brulees - vanilla, espresso and raspberry - tasted rich and creamy. Matt picked a chocolate mousse deep in taste but light and fluffy in texture, decorated with a tart raspberry sauce. Oh yes, I sampled everything.   I can't believe I'm actually giving a seafood restaurant located near the \"Waterfront\" 5 whole stars - but I did it, it's that awesome. My seafood crisis is officially over, I'm wild for Wildfish!"}
{"text":"Good Food, Service almost there  We had dined on a Monday night and the restaurant was fairly empty inside and one family outside on the patio. With this in mind, we received very attentive service from the time we were seated to the time we left.   My wife and children ordered the lobster and shrimp bisque and thought it was very good, better than Capital Grille's but not as good as Bonefish Grill though. I saw that each bowl had 3 or 4 pieces of lobster in it although my son said it was shrimp and he didn't get any lobster pieces in his. I had the crab and corn chowder and thought it was one of the best I've had.   In terms of entrees, my wife had the sea bass special and my daughter the broiled halibut and both dishes were nicely done. My son and I shared the 22 oz ribeye. Unlike some other places where they would split the steak onto two plates, here they bring you an extra plate and you split the steak yourself. The steak was perfectly done and very well seasoned.   Sides ranged from $6 for the small to $9 for the large portion. We ordered the sautéed spinach, Au gratin potatoes and the sugar snap peas with portobello mushrooms and all were very good.   All meals were good sized portions so by the time dessert came around, we only had space for the banana foster and one order of the sorbet.   Service was very good but I felt that perhaps our server was a bit new at this as there were some inconsistencies that I would not have expected at a higher end restaurant. Just little things like when it was time to exchange the regular knife with the steak knife, the steak knife was placed on the left beside the fork facing the wrong way or that the server would ask my children to hand him their plates after the meal or that when the soups arrived, the server put all 4 soups down in front of everyone with the pot the soup came in then poured the soup into soup bowls. Call me nit picky but you would never see these mistakes at other higher end restaurants.   The prices were on par with other chain restaurants like Ruth's Chris or Capital Grille. However I did find that it was a bit exorbitant to charge a market price of $89 for lobster tail.   Would I return? Probably no as there are lots of other good restaurants to try out in the Scottsdale area. I keep wondering if I should have tried Mastro's Ocean Club instea"}
{"text":"Great food very nice flavors. Great pineapple upside-down cake awesome. Raul is a top waiter took exceptional care of us."}
{"text":"I had the Chilean sea bass and it was to die for! Service was a little slow but not horrible for a busy Friday night in June? That alone says a lot in Scottsdale. We got quite a few appetizers and they were all great. I rate most restaurants simply for the main dish and that is why I gave 5 stars."}
{"text":"I use to love wild fish.. It has slipped a little. Ahi tuna was okay and my son wasn't crazy about the chicken.. One side came out very late. Will think twice before we go back."}
{"text":"Not bad for a restaurant in a mall...we had some seared ahi and seabass. Both dishes were fairly good. The place is pretty expensive, $25-40 per entree etc...but the interior is modern and looks good. It was very noisy, though, making conversation difficult if not impossible if you do not sit across a corner. Our main issue was the service. Everything took forever, items were forgotten, prepared in a different manner as ordered, the check did not reflect our consumption. The waitress had to be reminded many times of our food until it was finally produced. Granted it was a busy Saturday night, but if they cannot handle the number of guests seated they are in the wrong business. Summarizing, decent food, nice interior but lousy service."}
{"text":"Went for the first time last night. Had heard really good things about this spot and read the reviews on yelp which are promising. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the service. The menu is really good as well, very similar to Eddie V's in north Scottsdale, which I believe this is a sister location of. Ordered the calamari as a shared appetizer and it is a really big portion but also very good flavors and some spice to boot. Then had the Chilean Seabass on a bed of spinach as my entrée, and as a shared side order, went with the crab fried rice with scallion and mushroom! Food was very well done and as a bonus for me came out very hot and stayed hot! I hate when my food gets cold as I'm eating. So, I definitely recommend Wildfish Seafood Grille for their food, atmosphere, service and their cocktails and wine list offer great pours as well. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Every time we come here  the food and service is always incredible. Our waiter Rachel was just unbelievably on top of her game and very professional but yet personable. I had the steak and lobster tartare, wow that was good! We also had the shrimp and crab salad also very good. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Super classy place to go. Food was great, service was awesome even sitting at the bar. I sat next to regulars who eat there all the time. Fried oysters yum! Truffle mac snd cheese delish! Lobster tacos were soooooo good! Everyone around me looked like they  were having a great time and I really enjoyed  it here. I found this on a visit Scottsdale website for best patios of restaurants! I would go back for sure"}
{"text":"\"Under the sea, under the sea, darling its better, down where it's wetter, take it from me...\" Or does this remind you of Splash? Maybe you'll catch someone eating the crustacean shells. Nah! Let's just have a normal dinner here. Go for the seafood platter if you're into the cold seafood. This includes the de-shelled crab, lobster, shrimp, oysters. This could fill two as a meal. This is more suitable for hotter weather since the foods are chilled in ice.   But if you're really hungry I recommend the Hong Kong style Chilean sea bass- which is a soy sauce based with wilted spinach. I've had this several times in which several years ago was much more tastier and the bass was a definite melt in the mouth effect. This last time around it seemed like it was a mimic of a Chilean sea bass.   This place is common for dinner dates, seafood lovers and foodies alike. I'll \"sea\" you later! ;)"}
{"text":"We've celebrated our anniversary there for about 5 years. It started out with awesome food and service.  We always spend well over $200 and thought it was worth it the first few years. This last year was terrible. I get the lobster which was still good. My husband gets their biggest, best steak and it was almost unedible. He didn't want to ruin the evening for me so he didn't say anything until after we had left. The service was not what we had been used to. The drinks tasted watered down. They used to put rose petals on our tablecloth for our anniversary and stopped that 2 years ago. I found out after this bad experience that they have been sold and someone else is running it. It showed! We won't be going there anymore. Too expensive for what we got."}
{"text":"Great drink menu - my dad ordered a whiskey, and it came in a martini glass - wayyy to much but hey, it was Christmas Eve!  I ordered a glass of Prosecco, as I was in a festive mood.   There were eight of us, so we covered a lot of the menu.  I shared a few dishes with my brothers girlfriend - started with the Hot Goat Cheese and Wild Mushroom Arugula salad - it was pretty big and the dressing was incredible.  Next we shared the Yellowtail sashimi - really fresh with red chile and a cilantro.  As the rest of the main dishes came out, we each had the Pacific Ahi Tartare with sliced avocado, citrus fruit, and toasted sesame crisps.  The server recommends mixing it all together, which he did for us.  This was a tad too much food, since we each got our own.    The desserts are baked to order!  We got the chocolate godiva lava cake which is one of the best I've ever had.  My uncle had the sorbet trio which was super fresh.    The only complaint we had was the lobster - it was raw!  My mom sent it back and it came out, she was very happy."}
{"text":"We had the battered oysters, scallops, and swordfish steak. The food and drinks were great! The only thing was the server forgetful and a bit snotty. Other than that, great dinner and atmosphere. Great for date night."}
{"text":"I am not sure what to think about this place. It's definitely has an upscale setting. Service was ok, I arrived 30 minutes late for my reservation and still got a table pretty quickly, off to a good start. But then we waited for a long time before anyone came to get us started...Anyways, we finally got some wine and started out with some oysters. They were pretty fresh, pricey, but it's scottsdale anyway. then it's entrees time:  I got a steak and my friend got some grilled salmon. they were ok, I've had better.   We left and haven't come back since last November. I mean I have no problems with this restaurant at all, just wasn't that impressed."}
{"text":"It was really good.  I went with the shellfish tower.  The oysters were really good and fresh.  I think they were Fanny Bay's and Gulf Coast.  I love shellfish and it is always fun to do something like this."}
{"text":"Such a great spot. Very friendly staff. Awesome chef. Chilean sea bass and crab fried rice were a hit, even with my 4 year old niece. Fresh fruit and coconut sorbet for dessert were perfect. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale from Dallas, had an excellent dinner with my lovely and talented wife, service and food reflective of Eddie V's in Dallas. Quiet, despite being crowded. Make reservations. Head to restroom when bill is coming so wife will pay. Everything was excellent."}
{"text":"High end EVERYTHING. Check out their happy hour for great wine and app prices. Servers are top notch and the ambiance is very inviting yet romantic.   Follow them on facebook for random deals every now and then."}
{"text":"If you want five star quality food for high five star prices, this is the place for you! You definitely get what you pay for. This is not one of those expensive seafood steak houses where they charge an arm and a leg and the food is average. All the food is of high quality and tasted amazing. They give you complementary bread-and-butter. The waitresses and the busboys all very friendly and all English-speaking. This restaurant gives you the feeling that they take care of their employees, and pay them well enough to have good people working there.  I ordered the 8 ounce flame mignon steak that was $39, it was by far the best steak I have ever had. They offered to butterfly the steak to spread it out and I think that helped make it amazing. I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Oops....had a discussion with our waiter, Ramon, about food allergies.  He assured us all would be fine,  halfway through the meal we discover the exact ingredient in the food.  The waiter never says sorry The manager , Tommy Buck , shows up after a 5 minute wait and  demonstrates lack of experience.  He offers to comp the offending dish.  I ask him if he has any managerial experience as none is demonstrated. He gets very  defensive. This is a shame as the restaurant ambiance is nice and our first dish was excellent.   It is a shame that there is no longer adequate training in the service industry."}
{"text":"Tourist Alert!!!  I like nice ambiances,  clean and all around good vibes.  Wildfish marks the spot. A little difficult to find as a visitor but no love lost over that.   We started with the Calamari. ..Good flavor but not enough sauce. The sauce seemed to be centrally located in the center.  Bread was good and typical. ..harder outside,  softer inside and butter.  I ordered the gulf shrimp entrée. Generous portions, not to salty...Great flavor...favorite part of the meal.  Tried Fried Rice  & Brussels Sprouts as sides. More than enough for 2 people in a small.  Pretty solid. ..liked the rice more though.  I highly recommend and would return.  I'm not high maintenance on the service side...no errors /normal attention = no demerits."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant!  Food was so good service was fantastic! Cocktails, Starters, the Wedge, and don't forget to try the lightly battered fried oysters!"}
{"text":"I came here on Valentine's Day evening with a couple of my colleagues because we were working in nearby Phoenix.  We arrived early, so we were politely offered seats at the bar while I table was being prepared.    Our waitress was awesome!  She was able to make some recommendations on the menu items and that was fantastic.  I had the George's bank scallops, while my coworkers had the Florida grouper and jumbo shrimp with lump crab.  We got the asparagus and truffle mac n cheese for our sides.  The scallops were perfectly cooked and seared on both sides, and the flavor was spot on!  The grouper was pretty good but nothing that I would consider outstanding.  The jumbo shrimp was amazing, stuffed heartily with chunks of lump crab.  All the seafood tasted really fresh!  I will more than likely make this a \"must visit\" when I make it back to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I didn't feel like there was a variety of menu items, and nothing really seemed to be that appealing. I ordered the Maine lobster tacos, and ate one bite of it. It was not appetizing at all, and definitely not worth $18. I ordered the mac and cheese as well, which I never order at restaurants, but nothing else sounded that great. It had a horrible taste to it, so I ended up sending both of them back. I never send food back, but with the price you pay there I didn't want to spend almost $30 on something I wasn't even going to eat. I then ordered the calamari, which was excellent! It had a great taste to it if you enjoy spicy food. There were a lot of extra toppings that came with it that I could have done without, but compared to everything else I tried there it was great.   Since it was my birthday I got a complimentary dessert, which was really good. I can't remember what it was called, but it had butterscotch, cashews, and was like a pudding with a cookie on the side.   Even though they didn't charge me for the food that I didn't like, it wasn't a great experience, and I wouldn't go there again. It's overpriced for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"This is one of the most AMAZING seafood restaurants I've ever been to and I've been to a lot!  I am a seafood lover and was very pleasantly surprised at Wildfish.  I had the Chilean sea bass in a delicate garlic lemon butter sauce.  SOOOOO good-the best I've ever had by far.  The fish was cooked perfectly and the flavor of the sauce complimented it perfectly.  I also tried the scallops which were also seared perfectly.  The server was very knowledgeable and attentive.  The atmosphere is great.  I will definetly be returning.  There is so much more I want to try!"}
{"text":"I went to this place as a treat for myself to celebrate a great money night at work... Here is what I had , 8ounce filet mignon roasted and sliced Oscar style with fresh crab and hollandaise  Perception wine 2008 glass  Crab fried rice with scallions and mushrooms  Batter fried oysters with light curry cilantro and pickled cucumber .. 2 sea breezes it cost me 102$ total.. And I gotta say this is by far thee best meal I've ever had in my 37  years of life ( including moms cooking) the steak cut like a knife through butter , the flavors of everything were simply amazing and I would return again, I'm a cab driver and I tell EVERYONE who gets into cab for a visit to Phoenix/Scottsdale they should try this place .. 5 stars the service was impeccable and genuine .. Try it you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Only dine here if you want exceptional service and delicious, delectable, scrumptious food!! My husband and I split the BLT salad, portion size for splitting was very large, chopped and tossed, it was very, very, very good. My husband had the grouper, prepared the way the menu explains, ( my husband is a grouper connoisseur), he said it was  better than the best he ever had in Florida!, portion size, was at least 10oz of fish! I had the Chilean sea bass prepared Hong Kong style,  very tasty, served very hot, beautiful presentation! It was fabulous!! Our server was Raul, very attentive, did not over pour our wine, pace of the meal was timed perfectly.Tommy Buck the manager was thoughtful, we loved talking with him, he listened to everything we had to say( which of course, was all great) This experience was 5 star, better than Mastro's or Ocean Club."}
{"text":"Went there tonight with some friends , had the AMAZING Seared Ahi Steak Tuna.. & Mashed Potatoes that come with it, really really good!"}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying that I left there so full I could barely walk because the food was THAT good.   Starting with a crab cake that had NO filler (yes your read that right....it was ALL crab) that was amazing. And its 7 oz. so its good for sharing. Followed up by a starter salad (the mushroom and goat cheese) which had flavors bursting all through it. The 3rd course  was market fish which happened to be a broiled sea bass. And they cooked it to perfection. No sauces added. Just fish that had a crispy outside and a tender inside. My side dish was the roasted brussels sprouts which were cooked with shallots and bacon. I couldn't stop there though. To finish my meal, I had the berries and cream. What was amazing about my berries and cream was that the cream had NO added sugar. The only sweetener was from the berries. It was perfect!  As for the service. It was spot on. People constantly monitored our table to be sure we were not left with empty plates or glasses."}
{"text":"The fresh and attractive atmosphere caught our eye when we were out looking for a place to dine on our last night of vacation. Because there was a wait and we had no reservation, we ate at the bar.  Service was excellent, informative and professional - everything you'd expect.  Wedge salad was good, but could have used some freshly cracked pepper. Per the bartenders recommendation my boyfriend ordered the crab-stuffed shrimp. While I do believe it to be a normally good dish (otherwise why would he recommend it?), it came out cold and over-cooked. My special halibut (prepared the same as the scallops) was too buttery and too heavy for such a small/light dish. The side mac and cheese was creamy and delicious. We also ordered the brussel sprouts (another recommendation from the bartender) which come sauteed with bacon and shallots. This would have been the highlight of the meal except for one major problem: a raw shallot bulb must have found it's way into our final dish - and when I munched down on it, the explosion of raw onion taste completely took over the whole meal. It was all I could taste the rest of the time! Not even chocolate cake could shake my taste buds from the onion stench.  What a shame - overall an underwhelming meal (except for the onion, of course). If I lived in Scottsdale I'd give Wildfish another shot - but I don't, so next time I'm in Arizona I'll probably be trying out a new restaurant."}
{"text":"We travel to Scottsdale once a year and always make a point at eating at the Wildfish Seafood Grille.  The food is delicious and the service is fine.  You will always find mixed reviews on service and food but for what is worth I would high suggest you give it a try. I give it a four star only because very few establishments are perfect."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it was because I was on a stay-cation spa weekend with my best friend, or because our waiter, Eric, was tall, cute and charming, or because I devoured the delicious mussels and sauvignon blanc I had, but I'm pretty confident in saying my dining experience at Wildfish was fantastic.  I had originally been to Wildfish for a Yelp event last fall and had some samples of their fantastic menu items. After that event, I had promised myself that I'd make another trip to eat there soon, and since my friend and I were staying nearby, I thought this would be the perfect place to start off our spa weekend.   We had reservations, so we were seated promptly.  Had I know about their summer happy hour special, I may have forgone the reservations and just waited to be seated in the patio or bar area.  No worries though, they had a great special three course menu option for only $25. I was all set to order from that, until I spied the mussels on the menu. I'm not a big seafood eater, but I've had really good mussels before, and I just knew that I wouldn't be disappointed by them here. And, of course, I was right!  They were tender and juicy and the broth was savory (just thinking about it now makes my mouth water) and extremely flavorful. To add to the culinary party in my mouth, we also ordered their Parmesan and truffle french fries. All I can really say is, they were tre magnifique!  I'm happy to say that my experience at Wildfish was just what I had hoped for. It was a great way to start off my mini vacation and to enjoy a fantastic meal with great company in cool and casual surroundings."}
{"text":"Made the reservation online and was seated right away. Great menu and wine list. Unfortunately, when I asked our server for a recommendation on a nice Chardonnay, his reply was \"I don't know, these wines are new\". It truthfully caught me off guard. He couldn't even attempt to make up something haha. They have an extensive wine list and I would've liked to have a server whom was a bit more informed and took their job a little more seriously since I was spending $50 on a bottle.  The 2010 Patz & Hall that I ended up choosing was quite nice. Nice balance. The crab cakes were good and then we ended up splitting the 'seafood tower' appetizer. The seafood was really fresh, the shrimp were large and tasty. It was a perfect appetizer for a larger party, but it was kind of overkill for just the two of us.   Because of how much food it was, we didn't end up ordering an entree. The portion of the appitizer was clearly marked, so that was my fault :).   Will be back to try an actual entree and am hoping to add stars to this review."}
{"text":"So after visiting the Sea Life Aquarium in Tempe, I suddenly had a  hankering for seafood ^_* haha well actually my bf made reservations on Opentable beforehand so it wasn't quite so sudden. So we had reservations for 7:15pm but we were a bit early and usually restaurants allow for early incomers to be seated but since they were quite busy we actually had to wait till 7:15pm..which is fine.   The place looked like your usual seafood and grill restaurant..not much uniqueness in it's arrangement or setting...dimly lit with bar in the center, booth seating on the right and table seating on the left. Didn't really have much of a Seafood/Oceany feel to it but eh I guess I didn't expect it to be like Joe's Crab Shack or something. After-all  this is a \"fancier\" place.   I thought the service from the hosts and our waitress was very friendly and great but on the other hand, the manager wasn't how I expect them to be. So there was this older Caucasian couple that was also waiting to be seated...and we were standing close to them...the manager walks by, smiles and welcomes them and tells them they'll be seated soon...I was thinking that we would get the same nice friendly greet and welcome from him but he didn't even smile or say hi. I felt offended because we were customers too...and shouldn't you greet your customers all the same way. Not only that but he walked passed us several times before we were seated without a greet or smile....I just felt very insulted. My bf and I look quite young and we are Asian....I'm not saying he's races but I did feel he was prejudice. -_-  Well anyways on to the food.....the food was decent, nothing to really rave about...the half order of Louisiana Oysters were pretty good, my Louisiana Red Fish Filet Sauteed with Jonah Crab and Lemon Chive Butter Sauce was made very well...I specially like the crab and the Lemon chive butter sauce went very well with the fish. On the other hand my bf's Broiled Swordfish had a very strong oceany salt/fishy  taste..which some might not be fond of....and it wasn't served with any sauce. Although it did come with a side serving of Crab and Avocado Salad which was better tasting then the fish. The side order of Sugar Snap Peas was also somewhat of a disappointment since it too lack taste.   Overall, I didn't really have a super spectacular dining experience at this restaurant. Hopefully the other locations of Wildfish Seafood Grille are much better. The bill came out to be around $80...seafood is expensive but I was also paying for quality of service, food and atmosphere of which I didn't feel like I got my bf's money's worth. =/"}
{"text":"I work so close to Wildfish it's truly a crime I hadn't been there before the Yelp Elite event last week. Oh.my.gosh.   Seafood is my kryptonite and Wildfish nearly laid me out. The crabcakes? I think I saw those...they were ripped from the hands of the servers before they could plant both feet out on the patio! The Ahi Tuna was amazing, so creamy with a hint of sesame oil (?)...mmmmmm. I bee-lined it to the oyster bar and tried to get them all in my mouth before anyone else noticed they were there.  The prawns were EEE-normous and even the endive with mushrooms and goat cheese was delightful. I liked my lemondrop enough to have two!   I see another review here about a chopped salad and 75 cent oysters so there's no way the Wildfish staff can get rid of me now!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting Scottsdale for my birthday, and had my birthday dinner here, upon the strong recommendation of my Dad, who comes here each year during Spring Training.   We started with the crab cake, which was very good, and I enjoyed a perfect Chopin martini with a twist. Next, we shared the mushroom salad and I just loved it, hubby thought it was pretty good. For me, it was so good I wished I hadn't offered to share it haha!   For entrees, hubby had the swordfish and he thought it was perfectly prepared and I had the sea bass. It was cooked thru just perfectly and was delicious, but was too rich (or maybe portion was just very generous) for me to finish. We shared the crab fried rice which was just okay - seemed overcooked and a little mushy.   We skipped dessert but the offerings looked very good.   Ambiance was nice, but we were surprised at how quiet and mostly empty it was on a Saturday night. The service was spot on."}
{"text":"The entire experience was a pleasure from the ambiance to the waiter/overall service and especially the food.  We had the calamari which had an oriental spin to it and was really good and the crab cake with no filler which was refreshing. We would highly recommend Wildfish Seafood."}
{"text":"OH.MY.WORD.  I have no idea where to begin.  Excellent dining experience! Great food.  Matter of fact, the apps and sides were the star of this meal.  The Breakdown:  Apps:            - Calamari. The best I've ever had. Asian inspired acccents                                melded perfectly, and the quantity was surprisingly                                adequate.       - Doz Oysters. Super fresh and delishious Malpeques. - Wagyu hot rock. Oh so tender and flavorful as it should be  Entrees:  -Sauteed Gulf   Snapper w/ crab. Über flakey and INSANE!  -Broiled  Swordfish w/  truffle fries.            Yada yada yada, super delish.  Sides:  -Truffle Mac   and cheese.         Holy tonail shredded control top pantyhose! Rich                                  and decadent and ridankulous! -Brussel sprotus. With BACON?! Need I say more?  Once again: APPS and SIDES!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We have been here several times and it is always great.  The service, food, and ambiance are all on point.  We will be back  TAL"}
{"text":"Incredible. On a Friday night with no reservation, they accommodated my wife and I. The food was just exquisite. I had oysters, and my wife had the crab cake. She said it was the best crab cake she has ever had. For the main I had the Chilean Sea Bass in a lemon-white wine broth that just melted in your mouth. My wife had the Georges Banks Scallops, and she said were very good. The BEST though, was the side dish that the waitress recommended with my sea bass - sugar snap pees. I never would have thought to order this, but she highly recommended. Both my wife and I thought this side dish was amazing. Prepared in butter, and served crisp, these had a really nice spice that kicked in very subtle. Overall excellent, and would go back anytime."}
{"text":"Probably the best meal Ive had in a long time. The atmosphere was quite romantic (we were there for our 11th anniversary), service was outstanding and the food was awesome. We had the cheese appetizer, Heirloom tomato salad, lobster & shrimp bisque, ahi tuna steak and Gulf white shrimp with Jonah lump crab...plus the crab fried rice and the broccolini. Everything was amazing. We even received a complimentary dessert for or anniversary - we chose the pineapple upside-down cake and it was the best Ive ever had!"}
{"text":"This is an Eddie V restaurant. Upscale and cozy.  Should I say more? I went in a Sunday evening. It was extremely slow which told me that I would receive a lot of attention from the staff. And I did! The staff was very pleasant. The restaurant carries one Reisling, but it was sweet to my liking. I ordered the shrimp and crab. I wasn't a fan of it. It was missing the seasoning. This place will not blacken the shrimp like some of the other high-end restaurants. My guest had the swordfish, same thing...not well seasoned...very bland. I've been here before and had a happy experience with the entrees. I'm so surprised that the dishes on this visit was so lacking. Given that I LOVE seafood, I will give them another chance."}
{"text":"Okay being from Maryland and loving seafood I have been on the hunt for many many years in the Phoenix area for a great place for seafood.  My husband and I had a date night here this past weekend.  THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT US!!!  He had a 1/2 dozen oysters that were amazingly fresh, I had the crab cakes and let me tell you they are definetly my favorite from anywhere including back home in Maryland.    For our entree we decided to split the special of the evening a seafood trio and boy am I glad we did because the portions are big and considering I had to try the Crab n Lobster Bisque soup which I wish I had some right now.  Our side we choose the crab fried rice and my husband said to me on Sunday next time lets get an order of the rice to go.  Desert well it was just down right sinful.  Service was exceptional from the time I made the reservations to the end of our date.  Tony our server was very knowledgable, and friendly.    Must Must Try if you are in the area!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and even greater service.     I would say we had the best server we've ever had (Dave).   He was very attentive and made sure the timing on our foods, refills, and service follow ups were exact.   Pretty expansive menu of seafood considering that this is AZ.   Showed up for an anniversary dinner and they had a hand signed card (from the staff), rose petals on the table, and a complimentary dessert.   Sounds a little gimmicky, but shows the extra effort to cater to their customers.  It was well appreciated.   The price point is a little lower than some of the more expensive steak house chains in the area, but food quality (we had lobster) was great!    My expectations were right down the middle road since this place is located in a strip mall near fashion square, and they were definitely exceeded.   If i had to name any weak points, it would be some of the sides we had (potatoes au gratin and pan seared mushrooms). They were good, but not remarkable like the main dishes and appetizers.  I would think our choices were not the best and willing be sure to try some of the other sides next time.   Couldn't ask for a better sear on the filet at medium rare to rare and the lobster was cooked to perfect time (not overdone like most \"high end\" places I've been to).   Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Went there for a birthday dinner, the food was amazing and their seafood are delicious!!!!  Service was awesome"}
{"text":"this is my go to spot  on Sunday nights when i just want conversation time with my close gfs and to satisfy my appletini cravings. Prior to Wildfish my past experiences with appletinis have not been satisfactory. Depending on where I get them, they come out too strong, too sweet, or too sour. Not sure the name of the bartender at Wildfish but her appletinis are DELICIOUS! Oh, I forgot to mention I come on Sundays because they have all night happy hour in the bar area where some of the appetizers are discounted as well as some signature cocktails. I've had the calamari numerous times and it's delish! the crunchy asian rice noodle that's sprinkled on the large serving of calamari makes this app so worth it! and, their truffle mac and cheese (small serving's $5) is so spoon licking good! I've had good times with friends, good and attentive service and the discounted appletinis at $5 apiece during hh is worth the visit. so stop by!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and over the top food.  The manager stopped by to say hello.  Nice touch.  Gluten free friendly.  Eat here, you will love it!"}
{"text":"Drop everything and go have a lemon drop from Wildfish. If you're not a lemon drop kind of gal/guy then opt for the whiskey sour. It's my favorite in the city. I went here for my 21st birthday back in the day and they accommodated a large table for happy hour pricing. We had a spread of appetizers ranging from the crab cakes to the blackened fish tacos. The calamari is some of the best I've ever had. I want to bathe in the lobster bisque.   For the main course, their scallops are perfectly browned. It's hard to find a place in AZ that knows what they are doing with scallops and these cut like butter.   It's a blast to sit at the oyster bar if you get the chance. The shuckers engage in good conversation and have a great sense of humor.   One of the girls I was with ordered mac and cheese and because of her allergy to onions they  made her a special batch. This was so impressive to me!   For the vegans/vegetarians out there they have am asian tofu dish that is to die for! However I don't mind eating fish from here because they take pride in sustainably caught fresh fish."}
{"text":"Upon entry we were greeted and seated by the hostess. Out server Kevin introduced himself and suggested a cocktail I went with his suggestion and was not disappointed.   The ambiance of the restaurant was classic with the servers uniforms resembling that of a tuxedo. The fine was in effect.   We started with the tuna and steak tartare which was amazing as well as the crab cake, which was large enough for us to all share even though there is only one. Lobster bisque was a little bit of a disappointment, other than the 2 pretty large pieces of lobster the bisque lacked full flavor. We ordered the seafood tower which fair warning can definitely feed 4 people. My son and I who both love seafood had a hard time finishing even half. It was great though. I was overwhelmed by how much food is included and the presentation is 5 stars on its own for sure! Brussels sprouts are a definite recommendation as well."}
{"text":"I do not even know where to begin. This place was fabulous. My husband and I were celebrating our 32nd anniversary this evening. We were greeted by our friendly waiter; Aaron, who handed us an anniversary card signed by the staff. Sweet.  We were given bread and butter to start. It was warm and soft on the inside, with a nice crust.   My husband opted for the swordfish which was in a lemon butter sauce and covered with crab and avocado. It was tasty and cooked to perfection.  I had the cod with Brussels sprouts which was equally good. Very flavorful meal.  To cap off our meal, the waiter indicated that dessert was on him. We opted for the bananas foster, which was worth every calorie!!  The presentation was lovely, flambé at our table. The cake was soft and moist, and the sauce was sweet. Add in the coolest of if the ice cream and the bananas......perfection. There was whipped cream with mint leaves on the plate as well, but we did not make it to that bonus treat."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our wedding anniversary. They treated us like royalty. Rose petals on the table with a card signed by the staff. Bananas flambé on the house for dessert. The entrées were delicious. My husband had the grilled white shrimp and I had the scallops. We widefinitely come back."}
{"text":"Wildfish never lets us down. My husband and I have been here many times, one of our favorites in Scottsdale. Service is great, food is great and the vibe is relaxing. Come in for happy and take advantage of sampling a lot of their appetizers! Fresh seafood and always kicked up a notch! I have also been to the original Newport Beach, Ca location.....definitely prefer Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We went to wildfish last night for my husbands birthday with our two teenaged kids. The service was terrible. Although they kept coming to check on us - it took an hour for our food to arrive. One of our appetizers (Fuji salad) had chunks of ice In it. When we showed a server, he explained that they keep the plates in a freezer. Then with his bare hands he lifted the ice off, which them broke back into the salad. He continued to try to fish the ice out with his hands. He then took the plate away - Blech. The food was fair - I remember it being much better. One of the managers kept checking on us - but did nothing to make amends for the awful service.  Definitely wont be back."}
{"text":"I really give it 2.5 stars. We went here my sisters b-day. I was extremely under impressed.   We got alot of stuff and it was either so so or real bad.   Calamari= the grossest shit Ive ever had. It was like the consistency of a cold stiff mozzarella cheese stick and it had that shape too. it wasn't cut into ring it was big thick sticks. The batter was like microwaved seeming because it had 100% no crisp, or flavor. I would be shocked if it wasn't prebattered and frozen. Gross  Tuna tar tar= it was just minced raw tuna but they didn't add any like flavored oil or citrus on it. It was just completely unseasoned. The fish had no flavor which is good but it was very plain.   Seared tuna= the sauce was good the noodles I likes, tuna was ok. This dish alone I would give 3.5   I would never come back here, the food was bad and just really blah. Especially for a place that specializes in fish."}
{"text":"Really Love this place. I have been coming here for 5 years now and have never reviewed it. $1 Gulf Oysters and $5 Svedka Martinis on Happy Hour. The Bone in Ribeye and Hong Kong Chilean Sea Bass are the best in town."}
{"text":"I have eaten seafood all over the world, and generally the best is south of I-10 in Louisiana and Mississippi.  However, the Wildfish Grill was wonderful.  The crab-fried rice was almost indescribable.  The swordfish was great!  Salads, sides, everything was top-shelf.  But the thing that took Wildfish from 4.5 stars to 5 stars was the Pineapple Upside Down Cake.  Good grief!  My mom would be jealous!"}
{"text":"My family probably go here for celebrations or eating out more often than anywhere else. The reason is that they on average repeatedly deliver good quality food. The servers there are always kind and respectful. If you have the money for it, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"So I'm not usually someone who writes reviews ... Just one of those who goes by what everyone else says. But I had such a great BD dinner celebration with my husband that I said it's time to post a review. Unlike others we wanted to take our time during dinner and told the waiter such. He was great, checked back several times to make sure everything was ok. We had grapefruit margaritas, yum. We each ordered the BLT salad which we could have split. Entrees were nice portions I had the special grilled trout that came with asparagus.  I mentioned to my husband no dessert. Hate when the waiters come sing Happy BD. But he mentioned to the waiter we'd like 1 scoop of sorbet on his way to the restroom (sneaky). To our surprise they brought a huge dish of 3 scoops of mango sorbet with 2 cookies and HB written in chocolate and a lit candle to boot. Yay no HB singing just made a quiet wish.  To top it off the waiter said the desserts on us :-)"}
{"text":"Finally made a reservation after months of wanting to try this place. Got there a little early and was seated right away (what a plus, rarely happens). Water came right away. Service was great and atmosphere was pleasant. I planned on spending 150-200(without tip) on this dinner..Boy did I walk away happy and a little heavy in the pocket book.  Getting right to it, I ordered the broiled swordfish with truffle fries. My gf ordered scallops with macadamia nuts and citrus. We ordered a caesar salad, spinach sauteed in garlic and shallots, and truffle mac n cheese. Wow! Meals were surprisingly plentiful and looked great. My swordfish was excellent (firm yet succulent) and the fries were surprisingly good and plentiful. The scallops were good, I've had better but there were about 6/7 large sized which is unusual. The mac n cheese was so tasty (asiago, parm, w/truffles). Spinach was excellent. Well prepared not too garlicky or oniony(such words) idk...but nonetheless, great!  I broke down and ordered dessert (the waiter advised us in the beginning that its takes 15 min). Came out on fire, literally..A pineapple upside down cake with rum (i think), whipped cream, and a divine caramel sauce! OMG..the other table was gawking over the setting. It was incredible, a must try!   Overall, this was a great place. Unpretentious, elegant yet casual enough..I WILL be going back..Oh yeah, 100 bucks including two glasses of 7 Merlot that was easy on the palate!"}
{"text":"The best dishes I had here would be the crab fried rice and the creamed corn.  I got the sea bass which was also good...I loved the broth it was in.  However I have tasted a better sea bass so I can't say it was my favorite dish here.  I also tried a bite of the double roasted chicken which was flavored very nicely and moist and juicy!  Customer service was awesome here. The waitress let me sample a wine that paired beautifully with the sea bass.  She also gave us the banana foster butter cake on the house which tasted absolutely delish !!!  They light it on fire at the table which was supercool!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there last night for our Anniversery. It was so special from start to end. It started off with rose petals on the table. Our waiter Aaron was wonderful. We started off with lump crab cake and seafood salad. Both wonderful. Next I had the Hong Kong chilian sea bass and he had chilian sea bass prepared differently. And we had small twice baked potatoe. Then for dessert. Bananas Foster. Everything was so wonderful. I can't say enough about this place. The only negative thing I can say was it was hard to find."}
{"text":"First time here. Perfect stop to start the night. Great ambience, nice casual, dim lights. The food is great. Staff is knowledgeable and very attentive. Had a three course meal that was amazing. Sat at the bar and bartender Devry is awesome. If your in Scottsdale try them out. You will not be disappointed. You want a desertgasm have the Butterscotch Pana Cotta!"}
{"text":"I'm a picky eater and I usually lean towards chicken tenders at restaurants I'm uncomfortable eating at because I've never been before. My first time at Wildfish was great in every way, though. The food is eclectic in my world but I gave it a shot and ordered mango lobster tacos and pot stickers. The pot stickers were my favorite. I'm glad I jumped at the idea of something new."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour Specials! Wednesday nights are Happy Hour until closing time. $6 select wine & speciality drink specials. $2 off all other wines & drinks. $10 appetizer & $14 speciality appetizer specials.   I enjoyed the Maine lobster tacos. There were enough to make a meal for me. I would also recommend trying one of their numerous desserts. The freshly prepared blackberry cobbler with vanilla bean icecreamserved in personal size cast iron skillet was a great finale for my dining experience."}
{"text":"Again, not so great. It's been 5 years since we ate here. Last time the service was a disaster. Thought, what the hell, I wanted seafood, so made a reservation, and came in.  Was told all the outside tables were allocated when we arrived. One was empty the whole time we were there, so, that was annoying. Really annoying on such a nice evening.  Started with the Bisque. A bit watery but not so bad. Chunky, but too hot, and tasted a bit \"burnt\" to me.  Next up were the entrees. My wife had the Filet medallions with the super jumbo shrimp, I had the gorges banks scallops.  Her medium rare steak was overcooked, the shrimp were not so jumbo. My Scallops were ok, but not great and the were not all cooked the same way.  Side of asparagus was not so great. Hollandaise was tasteless.  The server was very good, attentive, but the food was not worth the price. So this time, the service was good, the food not so much.  The $12 cocktails were not the greatest either, but we took a chance on the orange mojitos.  Last time we had a disaster of a visit, and the manager promised to make good but never did.   Maybe we'll give it another five years and try again. At least they had what we ordered and we didn't have to wait a long time to find out they were out of it."}
{"text":"Excellent experience.  Heirloom tomatoes with buffalo mozzerella was delicious.  I kept soaking up the dressing with bread.  Ahi tuna steak was also very good.  Sat outside and people watched.  I'd go back if in Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner a week ago.  Great atmosphere and food!  I had the Sea-bass and would highly recommend it! It was light, flaky, and very tasty.  Asked the waiter to make a wine pairing with the meal and he did an excellent job. I would recommend it - everything was top notch."}
{"text":"Even if the restaurant is located in the middle of the desert they serve the best fish and seafood I had in the US. The chef is offering daily fresh fish and seafood and creates very nice special dishes. I had a various oyster dishes like  thai curry seared osyster, fried oysters with seared tenderloin and proscuitto wrapped oysters. JUST AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"We do live in the desert. So anyone who lives near fresh water, please take this with a grain of salt. I know, I've had your fish and well, it's reason I trek over to your zip code. For here, it's really really good seafood. So much, it's the only time I rarely think of steak; as a carnivore, that's major kudos to this restaurant.   I like that the bar area is spacious and plenty of tables for groups. I agree that they don't have any bad seat, indoor or outdoor. Staff is always friendly and personable. Happy hour is lively and fun. Everybody is wearing a smile, maybe from all the drink specials or because I am flashing them mine. I prefer to graze over the calamari, lobster tacos, crab cakes and a few dozen oysters. Definitely great spot for after work drinks. If you decide to stay, have the Chilean sea bass or the swordfish. No lie. You want to coat yourself in the sauce :)  Wildfish stands in good company among City Hall and Cowboy Ciao around the corner. It does an impressive job entertaining my out of town guests and clients. I will note though that every time I've ever been here, there's a large population of silverfoxes. But do you blame good taste?"}
{"text":"Really wanted the red fish again.....sad that it's off the menu!!! Also skip the chocolate godiva thing & strawberry mojito..."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and my experience was perfect. I enjoyed everything I ordered - I highly recommend the grouper. The service was prompt and polite. Our host (Charlie, I think his name was) was excellent. Thank you for a great night out!"}
{"text":"The evening started out fine, we were surprised at the lack of attitude at the door, nice booth seats in the bar area so we may partake in happy hour.  Someone brought us some delicious warm bread within minutes with seasoned butter.  The butter could have been a little softer, but other than that we were very impressed so far.  Then we sat there for about 15 min before the waitress came by to ask if anyone came and talked to us.  We said no, and she said she'll be right back.  Its fine, it was busy in there and she gets A for effort.  We order the lobster and shrimp bisque and the crab and corn chowder.  The presentation was very cute, it comes in steel pots on warmed bowls.  Then the waiter pours out the soup into the bowl before leaving us.  Pretty cute, love the warmed plates.  The bisque was delicious, but slightly heavy with the cognac.  The chowder was surprisingly sweet which my friend didn't like but I thought it was fine.  We also got the kung pao calamari.  Presentation was pretty grand, but upon further inspection the dish just did not work.  They had poured the sauce over the top so then you get soggy bits along with dry pieces of underseasoned calamari.  The sauce was great, but they used cashews instead of peanuts which did not help in this dish.  I think cashews have a place in milder sauces, but it just got lost in this kind of sauce.  I was very disappointed, although I would love the kung pao sauce recipe.  Maybe even if they had the sauce on the side it could've worked..  We were also planning on getting some oysters but apparently they're out and won't have any for about another month.  Can't be helped, I'd rather not get them than get deathly ill from a restaurant trying too hard.  Anyway, if the oysters don't work out once we do try them I will be dropping this rating to a 2, but I'm giving them the benefit of doubt.  Would definitely not recommend the kungpao calamari, but the soups were worthwhile."}
{"text":"Best Surf 'n Turf I've ever had.  Beautifully done tasty beef and delicate seafood made for a memorable meal. Perfect service, too!"}
{"text":"After a long day of shopping in Scottsdale fashion we decided to try out some new restaurant nearby and eventually settled on Wildfish. I have heard some good things about this place before, and for most part, the praises were well deserved.  As we walked to our seats, I took notice to the dim light which sets a very nice and intimate ambiance.  However the dim lights weren't good to take pictures of the food.  We first ordered a yellowtail sashimi to share; it came with a light soy glaze with piece of jalapeno on top. A little strange and not all that memorable, but the fish was fresh and enjoyable. For our entrée we ordered an Ahi tuna steak over sautéed shitake mushroom accompanied with a wasabi potato puree. The tuna was a very thick cut, and it felt eating a tender steak. The top and bottom was seared and I loved the slightly charred taste. The center was kept raw but slightly warm. The tuna was very fresh; the sweetness of the puree complemented the fish well adding additional flavor to an already gorgeous fish.  Our second dish is a Chilean sea bass cooked Hong Kong style. Being a big fan of Chilean sea bass, it's very rare to find restaurant that still serve this fish being it is considered to be endangered. The fish, with its flaky texture, is soft because of the fat.  This gives it a lot of flavor.  I really like their Hong Kong style preparation method. They simply steamed the fish over a batch of tender spinach supplemented with a light soy sauce mixture. For $38 it is a very good deal considering typical Chilean sea bass dishes are very expensive.  I think this will be my new spot if I ever get the craving for good seafood."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, and good staff make this place worthy of our repeat business.  Nice bar area, and good pours are a huge plus.  Seafood is very good, and they have a lot of nice booths for more intimate setting.  No blaring music to have to yell over is a huge plus."}
{"text":"This is our go to restaurant!  I do not care for seafood at most restaurants but the crabcakes here are excellent. Service has always been wonderful. Fast and friendly. I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I was in AZ for business and had dinner at Wildfish, the crispy salt and pepper shrimp was delicious! Great service from beginning to end!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent!  Here is my run down:  * Hot Goat Cheese and Wild Mushroom Arugula Salad - I split this with my wife.  While it was very good, I wouldn't recommend splitting it because it wasn't that big.  I'm really not a big fan of frou- frou salads either so next time I'd like to try the wedge or Caesar.  * Seared Pacific Ahi Steak with Sautéed Shiitake Mushrooms and Wasabi Potato Puree, GingerSoy Jus - OMG!  This was an awesome dish.  Nice big ahi steak cooked perfectly along with those wasabi potatoes.  Holy cow sooooo good!  Awesome combination and oh so yummy.  *Crab Fried Rice with Scallions and Mushrooms = Awesome  * Crisp Parmesan and Truffle French Fries = Wow  * Truffled Macaroni & Cheese = I didn't get this but it sounds great and I'm definitely gonna try it next time  * Sautéed Spinach with Garlic and Shallots - eh...I guess it was ok for spinach.  Anyway, I can't wait to go back.  The ambiance is excellent and so is the service.  The prices are pretty much in line with what you would expect for a trendy seafood place in the area.  Next time I go I'd like to check out their happy hour which is supposed to be very good."}
{"text":"I was slightly disappointed by this place my first time. I went the next week for Happy Hour and it was great.  Lemon Drop Martini for $5 Calamari for $7 Ahi Tuna Tar Tar for $8 Gulf Oysters for $0.75 a piece  It was Friday and the bar was packed but 2 friends and I squeezed into to one of the long cocktail tables and had a great time talking to a couple."}
{"text":"Great service and probably one of the best restaurants we have been to.  We were traveling for a weekend getaway in Phoenix and we went to Wildfish to have some seafood.  I had the beef medallions with jumbo shrimps and my wife had the black fish in miso broth.  We also shared a crab fried rice.  Food was fantastic and service was amazing."}
{"text":"Food was great fresh oysters very fresh and ice cold always a plus!!! Out dinners served hot and cooked to perfection the staff was attentive and helpful"}
{"text":"The lobster tacos here are out of this world amazing!  You get two of them and they are stuffed pretty full of flavorful ingredients.  They are actually pretty filling by itself.  I would get them on their happy hour menu since they are $4 cheaper.  I also order the seared Ahi Tuna once for dinner here.  That was not very good at all.  I've never had  an Ahi Tuna be marbled with fat before.  Absolutely disgusting like a fatty steak.  It didn't have much flavor to it at all.  I love Ahi Tuna, and this just didn't match up.  It was served with some sort of salad whose dressing was so sour, I could not eat it.  I've only eaten the lobster tacos and Ahi Tuna here.  I would rate this place 5 stars based on the lobster tacos, service, and atmosphere, but since my entree was not very good, I'll have to give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"Good martinis, margs and great happy hour... AND great for dinner too if your headed out to Old Town, Id do this over some of the other Scottsdale outs.. I had the blood orange marg.. loved it.. one drink and I am a done--er... so it was good that the happy hour was there! I dont eat lots of bread, but had to that day... and its yummy! My date, (I use that word very cautiously... ) was rude and demanding and the staff put up with his overbearing, high maint ways.. more than they should have... crab cakes are awesome..:-) Dinner I had the Wildfish Chopped Salad... I actually crave that salad now!"}
{"text":"Happy hour visit. Very very nice place! The staff was great. Restaurant opens at 4pm, the will not accept dinner orders till 5pm. That is the only downside. Had to get a exception to order fries around 4:50pm. Food was good. Valet parking only, or park across the street at the mall. Can also sit outside on nice weather days. It is a. It pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for Wild Fish based on reviews from the locals. WF failed to deliver. The Maryland lump crab cake literally fell apart and had little cohesiveness. Crab meat dusted with breadcrumbs does not a crab cake make. The shrimp entree was equally disappointing because the shrimp was overcooked. Flying fish in fresh every day doesn't help if you don't prepare the food well."}
{"text":"Went here for Happy Hour on a recent trip to Scottsdale with my Dad and his lady friend. Wow, what a value. The HH drinks are priced at $5 each, which doesn't sound that great...until you actually taste them. These are top-notch cocktails. I had one, it was a blood orange margarita (I think), really great flavor. I also tried the Mai-tini. Both drinks seemed expertly prepared with quality ingredients. The blueberry mojito was equally tasty. Not the best drinks I've ever had, but a great value for $5.  The main draw here seems to be the Pacific oysters at 75 cents apiece (fried or raw). Seemed to be fresh and of good quality (this from a Seattle person) and the dipping sauces were great. We ordered a shrimp cocktail (huge shrimp/prawns) and some very tasty pepper shrimp. The salad was also very good. Fresh complimentary bread and butter were also a big plus.  So for HH I think this place is great. They provided excellent service and food at an affordable price. Not sure if the food and drink value would be as high, though, when using the non-HH menu. Will have to go there for dinner next time."}
{"text":"If someone would have told me that I would eat one of my best seafood meals in Phoenix, you'd be nuts. Well it has happened. The Chilean Sea Bass at Wildfish is exquisite.  We loved the food so much, we actually came back a second night in a row to test out the happy hour (they have a bangin' HH) -- great bartenders too.  Great date restaurant located in Scottsdale that has a low key/lounge ambiance. Just be careful with the valet service, don't use it if you don't need to. Parking is available right there or below in the garage. Valet will actually cost you an absurd amount when the sign says \"complimentary valet\". Even if valet is not on the house, it should be for an upscale restaurant like this."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner spot, although their decor is a little outdated. Sister restaurant to Eddie V's Prime Seafood, so they share a few of the same menu items, but I have to admit their Lemon Sole is better than Eddie V's, and I couldn't imagine how or why. In any case, it's still a very romantic place to take someone and the staff is knowledgeable and professional."}
{"text":"My husband and mom were on a road trip from the San Francisco Bay Area and decided to stop at Wildfish Seafood Grille in  Scottsdale, AZ, for their first time.  They were completely amazed with this restaurant!  They raved about the delicious food, the great service, the lovely ambience, and amazing wine list!  They said this restaurant was much better than most restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area...whoa, that is a huge compliment....I wish there was one close by so that I too could enjoy such a top notch restaurant!  In addition to the great dining experience, Damon, the manager, and Suriya capped this amazing experience with their kindness as they quickly and efficiently responded to my mom's concern that she had left her glasses at the restaurant.  Suriya was so helpful in finding the glasses and she quickly coordinated with Manager Damon to have the glasses mailed to my mom in Walnut Creek, California.  Wow, I most impressed with the professionalism of Damon and Suriya  who's actions reflect the high standards of this restaurant and the high value they give their customers!  Thank you for everything!"}
{"text":"Went here for my first time tonight and am genuinely impressed!  My husband and I sat at the bar and had some wine and appetizers and I will definately be back for more! The bartenders were nice, the food was great, and the atmosphere was awesome! There's nothing I like more than being served by people who genuinely seem to enjoy their jobs. The bartenders made great conversation, filled our drinks the second we needed more, and our food came out quickly! Kudos to wildfish you obviously take pride in your restaurant  and staff!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! From service to food, I couldn't be happier. It was definitely one of the best dining experiences we've had.   We went for our anniversary dinner and like most places when you mention it's a special evening whether it be a birthday, anniversary, etc; they will write something on a complimentary dessert plate. Wildfish went above and beyond all expectations. Rose petals laid out on the table with such a sweet card signed by all of the staff. Definitely felt the love and appreciation for our business.   We started with Tartare of Pacific Ahi Tuna for the appetizer and it was exquisite. The flavors were so balanced. A little citrus, a little sweet and savory taste in every bite.   Our second course was the Warm Goat Cheese Salad. And most people that knows me knows I have a true appreciation for cheese. I love how the champagne vinaigrette kept it very light but still very filling at same time with the goat cheese.  Now let's get to the main course shall we? The Chilean Sea Bass was to die for. I was a little concern at first due to the soy sauce as the flavor enhancer but I was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't salty like I had anticipated. The sea bass melted in your mouth like when you find a good steak house the cooked your filet mignon to perfection. So all of you red meat eater that wants to a change, try this! Every bite of it with a combination of the soy sauce broth and ginger was an explosion flavor heaven in my mouth.   My boyfriend had the Parmesan Sole. Of course I had to try it. I loved how the crust wasn't so thick. You get the crispy without sacrificing the flavor. You can't go wrong with lemon garlic butter with Parmesan. I do love how balanced all the dishes were.   The Hot Chocolate Godiva Cake with vanilla ice scream was scrumptious. Now I'm not big on sweets but this wasn't overly sweet. Plus we had a good reason to have a cheat meal. Lol  So I neglected to mention our server in the midst of obsessing over our dinner. I feel so apologetic I can't recall my server's name. He was excellent but I'm terrible with names if I know I won't have more interactions with you. But his service was excellent nonetheless. Very knowledgeable when it comes to the menu and wine recommendations. Now don't get me wrong, I'm well aware that it is their expectation of their staff to know their menu but that doesn't mean that always happens. Nothing ruins your experience more than terrible service. I will be the first to say let's leave even if it means I've wasted an hour of my time waiting. Glad that wasn't the case.   I highly recommend Wildfish if you enjoy a good fine dining experience and of course seafood!"}
{"text":"When we were there around Thanksgiving time we asked the front desk staff to recommend a place to eat nearby the hotel and they suggested this place.  The decor is charming and it went downhill from there.  The hostess acted like she was doing us a favor leading us to our table.  The main server was short on attentiveness and personality but his assistant was a joy.  He made sure water glasses were filled and more bread was brought out when we asked for it and he always had a smile.  We saw him more than the main in white jacket server guy.    The food was no big deal for the price.  It was just adequate.  Where they totally dropped the ball was desert!  I ordered the warm pineapple upside down cake.  I assumed warm cake meant it was brought out to you warm.  Ummmmmmmm, no! It was cake that was brought out to the table and then presented flambe.  Now flambe is one thing and I have no issues with it.  Having the dish placed in front of me, the server pouring the flammable liquid on it and splashing me with it and then lighting the thing in front of my OMG am I going to have a Michael Jackson hair on fire moment here - not cool!!!  The pineapple on the cake melted so much that it was too gooey to chew and the taste of the rum was more than I could take.  Normally when something is presented flambe they pour the liquid and light the dish AWAY from you and the alcohol evaporates enough before you try and eat it.  I could only manage a couple of forkfuls before I shoved it away.  I contacted the management later and we had a nice discussion especially about how not to scare the *&^% out of a customer with flames.  Would we go back to this place when we return to Arizona? How about no."}
{"text":"Since visiting in late 2008 we have been here numerous times.  We just love it.  We had a little birthday gathering for my hubby this past Saturday and our sever Charlie was on top of it.  He had some helpers as there was 16 of us but he was just fantastic!    I tried for the first time the Seared Ahi Tuna Steak and I think I will have dreams about it until I have the pleasure of visiting Wildfish again!"}
{"text":"Took my family here for Mother's Day and we were all pleasantly surprised. Didn't know much about this place initially, but it was great. We had the seared tuna to start with as well as the crab cake. The crab cake was memorable for sure. We all ordered an array of different seafood items off the menu. All of them were very delicious (especially my scallop dish). Our waiter was very friendly- if he was unable to answer one of our questions, he promptly found the answers for us. He had a good recommendation for a beer pairing as well as our meal choices. The ambiance is very nice. White table cloths and the waiters wear white suits. There aren't many seafood restaurants in this part of town (or the valley really), but this one is very good... if you can afford it :)."}
{"text":"I will never eat fried rice at a take out restaurant again ... the fried rice was very good.  The lobster tacos were great.  Service was great, enjoyable atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went to Wildfish for a birthday celebration. I almost didn't book the reservation here because I read another review that said they didn't do anything special for birthdays- but they did! They provided us with not one but three free birthday desserts for our table and they were all delicious. Our waiter was excellent and took great care of us."}
{"text":"I found it yesterday while checking for \"Top Happy Hour\" in Scottsdale on Yelp. Although the link was wrong, I looked at Wildfish and the menu looked great. My wife and I stopped in before car shopping. We were seated right away near the bar . Rachel was our server. She was awesome. I mean one of the best servers we have ever had. We ordered the Oysters, Ahi and Maine Lobster Tacos. (I am from Boston and have never had that)  Everything was great and the prices were reasonable. It might be our new Friday after work place to go."}
{"text":"After trying two other restaurants in walking distance but not liking the long wait times, we went to Wildfish, and I'm glad we did. They took us right in. I thought, maybe the food is not good or something. The prices are a little high, but this is a high end place. They had fries so my 6 year old was happy. The waiter was EXCELLENT! He understood kids. My husband had lobster bisque and I had the mushroom salad - both were excellently prepared. We shared the double breast of chicken. Wow, two big portions for both of us. We paid 60 - the same we would have paid at either of the other restaurants, but we got right in, had a great waiter and great food. I will go here again!"}
{"text":"After four years of silence, the time has come for me to dust off the review writing pants and get down to business. That being said, Wildfish is quickly becoming one of my favorite restaurants in Scottsdale.  The girlfriend and I came here last night with her parents for a Mother's Day dinner and everything was great. The hostess offered a rose to every Mom that came into the restaurant that night, which was a great touch. As far as the dinner was concerned, the food was fantastic.  This is one of the best places in town to get oysters as they are always fresh, and the selection is constantly rotating. Once again, they did not disappoint. The entrees were highlighted by the Swordfish with red chile vinaigrette, New York Strip with black pepper sauce and my plate of Georges Bay Scallops that were seared to perfection, and topped with citrus juices and brown butter sauce. Two words - Damn. Good.   The service was good and is typically very consistent in my experience. Attentive but not overbearing is always the key. All in all another solid dinner at Wildfish. Great seafood in Scottsdale is hard to come by and these guys nail it every time.  Bonus: Happy hour here is awesome, $1 oysters...cant go wrong with that."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful every time. My husband and I typically do HH, but went with friends for dinner in the dining room a couple of months ago and the food really is exquisite. Chopped salad, salt & pepper shrimp, crab cakes, lobster tacos and side mac and cheese are all to die for!! Service is always great and bartenders are super friendly and speedy. Shop til you drop then chow down on the best seafood in town, cheers!"}
{"text":"I stopped by for dinner last night assuming I could eat a healthy dinner of fish and veggies but unfortunately all they have here is fish made with butter and sides that are not diet friendly. I settled on the Wildfish salad made with jonah crab, gulf shrimp, tomato, avocado, blue cheese and walnuts. $18 is steep for a salad but I enjoyed every bite. My friend ordered parmesan crusted sole. I took a bite and made a mental note to order it next time I dine at Wildfish. Service was fast and friendly. If you're looking for a nice seafood dinner I highly recommend Wildfish just make sure you're not counting calories!"}
{"text":"How have I not been frequenting this place all these years?!?!  1.  I love happy hour 2.  I love oysters 3.  I LOVE lobster bisque  Wildfish delivers on ALL three accounts. Now, there is a downside.  The average age of the clientele is probably ...60. But whatevs, my mom's gotta have some place to try and pick up a mans."}
{"text":"Took my wife for her birthday and practically drained our savings account to fill up on food. I will say this: though its expensive, it's some of the freshest fish in the valley!"}
{"text":"Truly outstanding food, unreal service and an awesome happy hour!! Will definitely be back again. Strong drinks, huge oysters, and awesome crab cakes. Highly recommend! Also, ask for Charles T--he's amazing!!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a nice place to take my girlfriend for her 28th birthday on April 25th. She loves seafood so after reading all the reviews about Wildfish I thought I would give it shot. The place is everything that people said in the other reviews. It is a pretty fancy place but not snooty. I would've gave this place 5 stars, but they didn't give my girlfriend the free sushi roll that I heard about. Even though there was a table right next to us also celebrating a birthday and she got it. But they did give my girlfriend a free desert. The food was some of the best seafood ive ever had in AZ. the bacon wrap shrimp we had for an appetizer exploded with flavor the moment it hits your tongue. I had the Louisiana red fish with a light chive butter sauce. The whole meal was just right, not heavy or oily at all. Had it with the mac & cheese truffle that also was really good. I had to growl at my girlfriend when she tried to sneak a bite. She had the crab stuff shrimp and a twice baked potato. She kept going on about how good it was. For desert we got the pineapple upside down cake everyone raved about. And it didn't disappoint. I let my girl take the first bite since she was the birthday girl and when she took that first bite. She made a orgasmic face that made me kind of jealous lol. But when I took a bite I knew why she made it lol. We will definitely be going back there in the future. Expect to pay about $50 minimum per person. And try to make alittle crumby mess on the table. The waiter has a little thing called a crumber that he uses to scrape up the crumbs. My girl and I got a laugh out of it. The only negative I would give would be that the waiters came by alittle too frequently for our taste that we didn't get a chance to really enjoy our dinner before they came around again and again. Shout out to the people next to us who also had a birthday that same day. And when they found out it was my girls birthday the whole table sang her happy birthday. Very nice of them to do that."}
{"text":"This place is awesome..i had the halibut, sister had the sole and momma had the salmon..they were all amazing and perfectly cooked. Its a beautiful restaurant but it gets packed so you will need reservations. At 6.40pm on a friday night the place was jammed.  The wine list is very reasonable as well. Ask for chad to be your waiter..he's a good kid and perfectly helpful."}
{"text":"Being from New England you tend to be spoiled when it comes to seafood. Therefore, I've learned to lower my expectations when I'm traveling. It's not to say you can't get great seafood anywhere else but the freshness is tough to match when it's served the same day it was caught.   Wild Fish was a welcome surprise. Our server Ashley was outstanding. She was professional, thorough, sincere and a pleasure to work with.   The food was outstanding. My wife had a jumbo gulf shrimp dish that she absolutely loved. Fresh, crisp and tasty.  I had the sea bass and it was also fantastic. The portions were better than average. The prices are very good for a restaurant with a decor and style this nice in this area.   I highly recommend it and ask for Ashley."}
{"text":"3.5  This was a good happy hour. Nice apps for half price and bartenders who knew what they were doing. Warm cheese was gorgeous, and I am trying to find a Wildfish menu to tell you what I had exactly (it's been nearly over half a year). Can't so I'll tell you approximately: something with shrimp, something with calamari, and I think a salad. If that helps, I'd be amazed. All in all, I'd say it's good (and yes, amusing people-watching at times)."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner last night at this place. First off, the crab cake appetizer is to die for.  Had the mushroom goat cheese salad which was divine.  For the main course , had the grilled shrimp oreganato served over crab meat, this was delicious and I enjoyed every morsel.  This restaurant is a must, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the best seafood place I've been to in Arizona. I have been here three times and each time they've knocked it out of the park. Now, you're going to pay a pretty penny here, but you get what you pay for. Since it's more of an upscale place, I decided to be adventurous and try the swordfish since I've never had it. Blown away! Perfectly cooked with a little bit of Chipotle thrown in. (That's a good thing.) Mac N Cheese was excellent as was the Lobster Bisque.  Also, do yourself the service of ordering dessert. I've tried two, the Banana Fosters and a S'more concoction of some sort. The S'more was very good but that's only because the Banana Fosters from the previous visit was amazing and set the bar so high. They light it on fire in front of you, too, which impressed me. (Is it showing that I don't eat upscale a lot?)   Now, that said, Wildfish, like everyone else who doesn't do this, heat your butter up! If you are going to serve bread to customers while they wait for their food, allow them to spread butter without ravaging it in the process. Cold hard butter sucks. A small complaint, but it's fair game for an expensive place.  Next time you're out in Scottsdale and want to treat yourself, try this place, especially if you enjoy seafood. I've never been disappointed. Great place for dates, too. They will be impressed, if not by you, then by the food. :p"}
{"text":"Came here with my girls to celebrate my 30th birthday. I had been craving a really good steak and upscale dinner for sometime. We originally wanted to go to Eddie V's but being superbowl weekend in Phoenix, they were all booked. Wildfish's menu is almost identical to Eddie V's, but they were also booked when we called. The hostess was so sweet and took our information in case of a cancellation and called back that same day! The food was amazing and good size. I had the 8 ounce filet oscar style and it was cooked to perfection. The service was outstanding but be careful walking around, the floors were a little too waxed or something and really slippery."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant!  Wonderful service, great food and a lovely menu. Very easy location right outside Fashion Sq near a lot of other great restaurants. Great fish, so fresh and such a great selection. Really nice atmosphere and easy to get into on a Friday night. Definitely should be put on anyone's list for seafood in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"When you first walk in you are kindly greeted by the young lady up at the front (Jessica). She was warm and genuine as we were walked back to our table to be seated. By the way, I recommend a reservation no matter what...it saves you from a possible wait.  We ordered our drinks and the waiter (Alejandro) was kind enough to allow me a tasting of the wine BTG before I commited to one. I was a bit skeptical ordering the crab cakes to start due to my very 'specific' palate for one of my favorite things to eat. I was happily surprised that is was flavorful, not over/undercooked and tasted quite fresh for seafood in the desert. Moving into entrees, my boyfriend ordered their bank scallops and I ordered the Hong Kong style seabass. We ended up sharing both and I must say that while the fish was good, the scallops were better! The scallops were done in browned butter with fresh fruit and nuts garnished with some micro greens. That dish alone is worth going back for.  And to top it off, the MOD (Tommy) was kind enough to stop by to make sure things were to our liking. I do not generally like chain style restaurants and how the individuality of the cuisine can get lost in the coorporate world. I will return here due to the professionality of Jessica and Alejandro, the class found in the food and the ambiance created by the staff. Thank you for actually turning my chain-skepticism around for once."}
{"text":"Update since my initial poor review:  Almost immediately after sharing my experience in a Yelp review I was contacted by the Director of Operations for Wildfish. During a phone conversation he sincerely apologized and was determined to invite us back for a meal on them. We accepted his offer but decided to try their sister restaurant nearby, Eddie V's. He gave me his cell number so he could personally make the reservation when we decided to dine there.       Everything about the meal was perfect from the service, to the drinks, and the food. Most importantly, the customer service I received was hands down the best ever! More companies/restaurants should take note and learn to appreciate their customers the way Wildfish and Eddie V's does..! Thanks Dave for making things right! Your dedication to the customers you serve is truly appreciated!"}
{"text":"YES YES YES!!!!!  This place should be X rated it's that good.  One of the best restaurants I have ever been to.  I had the yellowtail sashimi, and the crab corn chowder.  Our table shared the crab fried rice and the asparagus with prosciutto and egg.  All were beyond expectations.  And my friend talked this place up quite a bit.  The margaritas were exquisite (I had 3).  They also have quite an extensive wine list.  The ladies I was with all loved their wine selections.    I rarely order dessert at restaurants but how can you pass up bananas foster butter cake?  Butter-Cake????  I have to have it.  Someone else ordered the Smore dessert.  That was good but the butter cake.  It was all that and more.  We almost wept while eating it.  No joke.  I will be traveling to Scottsdale a lot for work in the upcoming year.  I get $59.00 a day in meals and I am starving myself next time so I can splurge on  Wildfish.  It's worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"What a great place! Once we arrived the places was packed. We had a reservation, so were seated right away.   Atmosphere: A modern looking space, with an industrial type of feel. The servers are dressed in jackets and ties. Kind of reminded me of what you see servers wearing on cruise ships. The uniforms didn't seem to fit the decor.   Service: Our waitress was super friendly, as were the other servers. I used Opentable to make our reservation and they ask if it is your first time dining at the restaurant. I always answer it and figure it goes to some kind of analysis. For the first time, the restaurant acknowledged it. The manager(?) came over to our table after we had placed our order, introduced himself and said \"I heard it was your first time dining here and I wanted to welcome you. I had the chef make this for you.\" It was a spicy tuna topped cucumber and it was delish! What a nice touch, bravo to Wildfish.   Appetizers: Shrimp cocktail; great texture served with cocktail sauce, atomic horseradish and chipolte cream. They're not lying about the horseradish being atomic, it was hot, but great with the shrimp. The chipolte cream was divine, I think it would have been good on anything. The fresh oysters were also delicious, great taste without being slimy or fishy. Along with the cocktail sauce and atomic horseradish, they were served with a shallot champagne vinaigrette, yum. I love how they gave you what you expected, but also threw in a little surprise.   Entrees: Gulf Snapper Filet Sautéed with Fresh Jonah Crab and Lemo Chive Butter Sauce; cooked perfectly and a great dish. Broiled Swordfish Steak Frites with Grilled Mushrooms and Truffled  French Fries, really tasty and the fries were awesome.   Sides: Crab Fried rice was so toasty and decadent. The sauteed spinach was unbelievable with shallots and garlic.   Before the entrees were served our waitress told us about their baked to ordered desserts.....how do you pass up a baked to order dessert? Well you don't!   Dessert: Pineapple upside-down cake with a bourbon sauce that was flambeed and butter pecan ice cream. O-M-G, so incredible and decadent. Just an amazing dessert!   Wildfish is just wonderful all around!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a Thur night (02/17/11) and the place was very busy.  Our wait staff were excellent, the food was good, served hot, and cooked perfectly.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant!  The sides are served family style and were delicious.  With a couple of glasses of wine expect to pay around $50 per person."}
{"text":"My Husband took me here for our 7 year anniversary in September (I know late review). Fist I have to say that immediately walking in the atmosphere was exactly what I wanted. Dimmed lighting, soft talking, and our table was beautifully decorated, there were beautiful fresh rose peddles spread all over the table with a \"Happy Anniversary \" card on it signed by the staff.  Our waiter was nice and accommodating to our needs. Checked in with us enough with out hovering over our table. He was also very informational about the menu as this was our first time there. The food was AMAZING if you like seafood. :) Then our waiter brought us the desert menu and we had the Bananas Foster which was flaming and quite delightful! To our surprise the waiter indicated that desert was his treat. Overall absolutely an amazing experience."}
{"text":"Did the Easter Day lunch here, Nice hostesses and waitstaff. I .ordered the jumbo prawns and they were delicious. We ordered the flaming cake and it was ok. Abit pricey for me, but my cousin paid for it. Only complaint would be that the doors were wideopen (to show they're open for Easter I guess), but we had all kinds of flies buzzing around. Really annoying."}
{"text":"We went to Wildfish to celebrate our 40th Wedding Anniversary. The food was great and the atmosphere was perfect. But what made our evening so special was the server named Ashely, She was outstanding! Ashley helped us select an outstanding meal. She was professional but cared we had the best time possible. You can really tell she likes her job and the customers she takes care of."}
{"text":"I met a girlfriend here for happy hour earlier this week.  The deals are fantastic- $5 glasses of prosecco and discounted food.  I had been craving a salad, but the only happy hour salad had shellfish (i am allergic), so I asked if there was any possible substitution.  The server suggested wok seared tuna, which was delicious and the chef easily made the switch.  It is so nice to go to a place for happy hour with a nicer menu and more upscale clientele.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Wife and I, with friends, celebrated my wife's birthday.  The food was delicious.  Wife had the halibut, I the salmon.  Friends steak and lobster.  The staff was very helpful providing suggestions.  The environment was above and beyond."}
{"text":"On vacation in AZ looking for a steak house for our carnivore girls but my hub and I wanted fish. This place delivered more than we could have hoped for! Absolutely everything we ordered was divine! My girls said the filet was the best piece of meat they had ever eaten. We also had the crab cake and ordered a second because it was so excellent. Many other delights were devoured by all and all were DIVINE. The atmosphere is very relaxing. So, excellent food, great ambience... Then came our server, to best of my recollection his name is Eric. He took the experience from excellent to sublime!!! His knowledge of the menu and willingness to stand at our table for at least 10 minutes to explain what made the steak the most delicious, the origin of each and every item we were considering, what was best to order that particular night and why, his relaxed ( not rushed or pushy ) delivery, all combined to make what was meant to be a nice dinner in Scottsdale unforgettable. Seriously, I consider us foodies from New York transplanted to San Francisco, two of the best food cities in the world... This experience was in my top 5 of all time!!! Thank you Wildfish, for amazing quality, preparation, atmosphere and ERIC. ( sure hope that's his name! )"}
{"text":"This restaurant is excellent! The food was incredible, the service was spectacular and the ambiance was amazing. Their menu is full of remarkably creative items. This is a seafood restaurant, but they twist the items so that they are different than other restaurants in this same category. With menu items like: Chilled Avocado and Crab Cocktail with Spicy Remoulade, Crispy Salt and Pepper Shrimp with Shiitakes and Sugar Snap Peas, Sliced Wagyu Beef \"Hot Rock\" Ishiyaki with Soy Broth, Lightly Smoked Filet of Atlantic Salmon with Bok Choi and Chinese Black Bean Vinaigrette, Seared Pacific Ahi Steak with Sautéed Shiitake Mushrooms and Wasabi Potato Puree, Crispy Cashew Calamari with Fine Cut Vegetables and Ginger and Soy, Truffled Macaroni & Cheese and Sautéed Spinach with Garlic and Shallots, who could ask for more!    From our experience: The bread was fresh and service was quick, friendly and efficient. The dumplings were superb and the sauce they were in was perfectly seasoned. The lobster bisque, scallops, ahi steak and swordfish were cooked to perfection. The only item we weren't impressed with were the french fries that came with the swordfish. Although not bad in taste, they didn't mesh with the swordfish. Other than that, the dinner was superb and I would recommend this restaurant for dates, groups and business evenings."}
{"text":"Excellent place to dine in Scottsdale. We went there to celebrate my friend's birthday, after a recommendation by hotel and our shuttle driver. They both were right, best seafood in the city."}
{"text":"We go here a lot for their incredible happy hour. And we drive 30 miles to get there, too - that's how much we like it! Awesome large martinis for $5, the happy hour menu has great selections. Get the happy hour salad and split it. It's more than enough for two. The oysters (big and extremely good!) are just one dollar during happy hour. A very classy Scottsdale restaurant. I probably been to this restaurant six times in the past few months - I've never been disappointed (except when they didn't have any $1 oysters)."}
{"text":"Went here last night for Happy Hour! Best Oysters I've had yet in Scottsdale. Great Place!"}
{"text":"On behalf of all those practicing Catholics in search of cuisine options for meatless Fridays during lent, I thank you Wildfish for making it pretty darn easy!   It's long overdue but I finally paid a visit to Wildfish last night. In the height of spring training madness and the thousands of additional desert guests presiding over our restaurants, I was happily pleased when I found out that Wildfish takes reservations! It was about 4:00 PM when I called and they had one time available; 8:00 PM. Sold! So at 8:00 PM sharp, we made our way to Wildfish. It was jam packed and lively with locals and tourists all enjoying some of the freshest seafood around.   This place is called Wildfish, so you'd expect wild fish to be served....right? Well, you're in luck because they stay true to their name! The server informed us that they pick out the fish fresh off the docks and fly it in fresh on a daily basis. Nothing is frozen and everything is wild (not farm raised). The menu has pretty much every item in seafood format you can imagine: everything from Lobster tacos to crab stuffed shrimp. The menu is so detailed and everything sounds so good, it was actually really hard to make a decision! But, I went with the Lobster bisque to start and had Lobster tacos for my entree. We then ordered asparagus and seafood rice for the table to share.   The second we sat down, they brought out thick and fresh bread and the type of bread you expect when you go to a seafood restaurant. They kept the drinks freshly refilled. The Lobster bisque came out in a hot metal kettle and when they placed the bowl in front of us, it was at that moment that they poured it in. This is an impressive way to serve bisque because it keeps it from getting cold from the time it goes from the kitchen to the table. The Lobster tacos were delicious and there was a good amount of Lobster in there. The tacos came with corn pico de gallo and fresh avocados with a tasty sauce included. The asparagus was a fresh veggie addition and the rice added the perfect twist to the meal. As I sat there enjoying my fresh fish, I almost felt like an ocean was just outside our doors (wishful thinking; I know).   Before I go, I must mention dessert! Each dessert takes 20 minutes to prepare and we couldn't say no so we opted for the chocolate souffle. Delicious. Delectable. Devilish. That's all.   So now that I have had the chance to finally try the seafood restaurant in my backyard, I come to the conclusion that you can in fact get quality and delicious seafood in the desert -- and in a great atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"First time at the summer Happy Hour and pleasantly surprised with the overall service and quality.    I was eyeing the blood orange margarita but the waitress commented it was sweet and recommended her favorite, the pomegranate grapefruit margarita.  Good advice; it was the perfect cold drink on a hot day.    Started with the complimentary bread that was hard to resist plus a few 75 cent fried Pacific oysters (same price as raw).  The oysters came on a very hot plate in the shells with a tasty dipping sauce.   Ordered the cold shrimp cocktail and was really surprised at the size and quality. Several bites per shrimp with a choice of three dipping sauces.  The four shrimp had a lot more flavor than what I had become accustomed to with Trader Joe's shrimp and much larger.  Note to self, next time try the raw oysters and the crab cakes."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix (work trip) - I wanted some seafood for dinner.  I decided to try Wildfish even though the reviews were mixed.  The atmosphere is nice,  the bartenders were friendly and the service was quick.  I ordered from the Happy Hour menu.  I had a glass of wine, crab cake appetizer and apple pear walnut salad.  The food was good but not superb. I've had better crab cakes and it was greasy and I could taste the butter."}
{"text":"This could have easily been four stars.  The bartenders were great - on task and quick.  Food missed the mark and was hugely disappointed.  Shrimp cocktail - shrimp was not prepped correctly and no one had removed the \"vein\" (aka poop line).  Crab cake had more filler than crabmeat. It made \"happy hour\" a little less happy."}
{"text":"This place is highly underrated. Seafood is my favorite which is hard to come by in Phoenix/Scottsdale. Beats little cleos in Phoenix. My boyfriend and I go a lot and get a glass of wine and a few small plates.  They have a great summer menu with almost half prices of certain plat a. The Lobster tacos are great. We've had them at Eddie V's in La Jolla (same exact menu by maybe more pricey ) by the way. The Eddie V's in Scottsdale quarter also ha star same menu as wildfish but is a lot further from where we live. A lot of people don't realize wildfish is tucked in next to culinary dropout. Their oysters are fresh shipped in daily. About three different types. The stacked Ahi tuna appetizer with mango and avocado is a favorite. Also the mini lamb chops are delicious. They have a great wine selection and atmosphere. Great servers too. Sea bass entree I think was a special was awesome. All their fish dishes you can't go wrong. Always bring friends from out of town to this spot. Also their desserts are A plus too!"}
{"text":"This place was great!!!  We went for our employee Christmas dinner and everyone loved it.  Our server Patrick was excellent, explained all of the specials and answered all of our questions about the menu without missing a beat.  Try whatever fresh oysters are on the menu, WOW!  As in other posts, be sure and get the crab fried rice as a side.  The truffled mac and cheese was out of this world as well.  I enjoyed the striped bass that was a special and tasted some from everyone's plates, I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu.  Very nice feeling in this place from the moment you walk in, perfect for a special evening or if you are just looking for GREAT seafood in AZ!"}
{"text":"my father has been itching to pay for dinner for us since he arrived in town. so we finally let him by going to wildfish.  we made reservations earlier in the week. our service was prompt, friendly, and gracious. he was so subtle, i barely noticed that our water glasses were constantly filled and our soiled plates were removed.  i had the ahi tuna steak....simply grilled and it was delicious. my wifes swordfish was decadent as well. i also had the shrimp and lobster bisque, which only had 3 tiny bits of lobster but it was still rich and tasty. my father had the grouper and ate it up like it was his last meal on earth. i tried his twice baked potato but i'm not really a fan of baked potatoes in the first place.  i ordered a side dish of asparagus. it was cooked al dente and was seasoned just right. it comes with hollandaise, but i asked for it on the side as i don't like it anyway. my wife's mushroom/arugula salad was crisp and delicious as well.   it's a bit pricey but the food and service is wonderful. thanks dad for a fine dinner...overall 3 entrees, a salad, 2 sides, 4 drinks....with tip...just over 200 bucks."}
{"text":"We decided to try out this restaurant for our anniversary because of the great reviews and we had not eaten there before.  Ambiance is very nice and definitely a great place to celebrate a special occasion. Our food was fine/good but my Hong Kong Seabass had a couple of bones so I would caution anyone who orders this dish.  I was a bit disappointed that we didn't get a complimentary dessert as other reviewers have mentioned in their posts. The only acknowledgement was a signed card.  Maybe it's no longer complimentary but in any case we may go somewhere else for our next special occasion."}
{"text":"I've been to Wildfish a dozen times in the past and it's just like the other Yelpers report: consistently good food, cute space, good service. What most recently impressed me, however, was their Happy Hour.  Tired of happy hour spots in town that are done around 530-6pm before you even have a chance to get off work? Or, offer just a few things on the menu? Wildfish happy hour totally rocks it. They offer Happy Hour daily until 7pm, plenty of time for those folks who get off work late. And, both their drink and menu selection is varied. There are plenty of $5 wines on the menu and martinis to choose from too. It's nice to see a place not just offer one of a few drinks on their list.  As far as appetizers go: crabcakes, calimari, shrimp, wedge salad, ahi tuna, lobster bisque-- they have plenty on the list! I'd definitely recommend the wedge salad (they can split it and it ends up being a total steal) and the crab cakes and lobster bisque are tasty as well.   The crowd is a little on the older side (bar is packed with 60-year-old+ patrons) but other than that, Wildfish is definitely a good happy hour spot gem in Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Okay, sorry, do not know how anyone could give this less than a 5 star.  Just returned from our Valentine's/Birthday dinner, and it was superb.  Flawless.  Simply flawless.  From knowing our names on the reservation, to the valet service, to our splendid server, Jeffrey (hope I spelled it correctly), to the ambience, to the food... amazing.  Jumped to our top 5 in Phoenix.  Jeffrey brought us wine samples to help us narrow down our choices (chose the Kim Crawford from NZ - a very fruity Sauvignon Blanc).  Simply delicious.  Excellent choice for the evening...The appetizers were delicious, so delicous that we were almost full by their end... Ris had the bacon wrapped shrimp with goat cheese, and I had the hot shrimp pot-stickers... wonderful.  Then Ris had the swordfish (thinly cut), and I had the crab-stuffed shrimp and crab fried rice.  Again, amazing.  Highly recommend this restaurant.  Not a single flaw... one of only 10 restaurants in Phoenix I can say that about..."}
{"text":"Tried Wildfish for the first time tonight, enticed by the Arizona Restaurant Week special. We did the 3 course \"special\" plus an appetizer and were stuffed. The restaurant was pretty, although we felt there was a bit of a disconnect between the look/feel they were going for and the space... Waiters were wearing white tuxedo coats and all other staff were dressed very nice, and everything was quite pricy $$$, but there were T.V.s on around the bar area (in middle, in view of entire restaurant) that had football on.   Appetizer: Had the lobster tacos and they were ok, not great, especially for $19. (This was not apart of the Restaurant Week special for $44 a person.)   1st course: We each had the lobster/crab bisque which was very good and rich, big bowls too which I was not expecting in this deal. Really enjoyed this.  Main: I had the Chilean Sea Bass ($10 up-charge) and my bf had the Roasted Chicken Breasts with scallion potatoes. I really enjoyed the Sea Bass, it was cooked perfectly although it was slightly too salty in my opinion, and the sautéed spinach. The roasted chicken was fine, not great, but we noticed that the dish only came with chicken and mushrooms even though on the menu it said the dish came with potatoes. When we finally got the waiters attention (several minutes later) he said that the dish did not come with potatoes, but he would go double check...he came back and told us that it was not supposed to come with potatoes with this deal, that the menu was wrong, but the chef was making some mashed potatoes special. The manager brought them over shortly and he was very nice, the mashed potatoes were really good. We also had a \"small side\" of truffled mac and cheese ($8), I love mac and cheese and truffles and this was good but again not great.   Dessert: My bf had the chocolate mouse with fruit, it was rich, delicious, and we ate all of it! I had the bananas foster butter cake...a small butter cake with bananas and sauce on top which was topped with a sauce and lit at the table! Served with fresh whipped cream and a scoop of pecan ice cream. Overall dessert was super yummy, only note would be that the topping on the cake was a little chewy.   Overall...it was fun to try a new place, tasty but not great. After the conversation with our waiter about the mashed potatoes, he kind of disappeared. We also overheard a manager (didn't appear to be the main manager, Eric, but maybe the bar manager?) say to waitstaff \"breakin necks and cashin checks\" ...not sure what that was about but it didn't seem very professional. We probably won't be back, as there are far too many good restaurants in AZ to go back to a mediocre one that was so highly priced."}
{"text":"First time diners but it won't be our last!  We lucked out without reservations and were shown to a nice elevated booth where we looked out on the floor.  Our waiter helped us with all our selections from the fresh raw oysters to the sablefish to dessert - everything was delicious including the sides of Brussel sprouts and the beets.  We really enjoyed ourselves.  All the staff from the hostess to the wait staff to the managers were wonderfully nice and attentive."}
{"text":"YUM. I LOVE coming here for dinner.  The food is always superb.  I think it's amazing that we have such a great seafood place in the middle of the desert.  First off, the service here is first class.  They know what they are talking about if they recommend you something and are always incredibly polite and respectful.  I have found one of my all time favorite dishes at this restaurant and hardly ever order anything different when i'm here, it's the Hong Kong style Seabass.  It's delicious and always perfectly cooked.  Pair it with a side of the crab fried rice too.  I've sampled quite a few other things as well and everything is always perfectly done.  If you like seafood, you'll like coming here.  and save room for desert!  they always have really good ones."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour, and the appetizers (and quantity given) were great.  Quantity, quality, and reasonable prices---the triumvirate!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Wildfish last night to celebrate his birthday. The decor is nice and I thought the white jackets the wait staff wore were a nice touch. The hostess stand is in a very weird little spot off to the side when you walk in and there is really no good place to stand while you are waiting for your table.  Our waitress was very nice and helpful, but the wait between everything (ordering drinks to getting drinks; ordering app to getting app; etc) was really long. I wouldn't recommend going on a completely empty stomach and starving.  On to the food...we had the crabcake appetizer to start. I've had better crabcakes I've bought in the frozen food section of the grocery store. The amount of lump crabmeat was seriously lacking and the flavors were off. I did appreciate the minimal use of filling. I had the jumbo scallop dinner. I loved it. The scallops were perfectly cooked and the sauce really complimented the scallops well.  My husband had no problem finishing what I couldn't!  He had the lemon sole...needless to say he ate more of my scallop dinner than his. You couldn't taste lemon or sole...all you could taste was the parmesan breading.  We had a half order of the truffled mac and cheese as a side and it was good. A half order was the perfect size for the two of us.  For a $100+ dinner, I didn't walk away loving Wildfish. It was OK and we'll go back because of the scallops, but not until we have a gift card or my in-laws come to visit and are paying."}
{"text":"Last weekend while visiting the greater Phoenix are we decided to have dinner here. It was a beautiful temperate day, so we enjoyed sitting outside. Peter was our waiter. What a marvelous experience we had. We chose to do it tapas style: Calamari, Crab Cakes, Hamachi Sashimi, Pot Stickers, and Crab Fried Rice. Everything was delicious. Service was great. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Was a little concerned over some of the negative recent reviews that this place was on a downward s trend but did want to try it. We had calamari, sea bass, and filet/shrimp special and found all to be excellently prepared. Good portions. Excellent,attentive but non hovering service. We had no complaints or even suggestions for improvement. As a side note I found their iced tea to be fantastic, chilled perfectly and so refreshing."}
{"text":"Service was impeccable. Food was pretty good, not mind blowing. Nice place, liked the outdoor area. Maybe a little expensive, but well located. Probably wouldn't go back -- so many options in that area."}
{"text":"Wilfish quality is always consistent. I've been to the one in Newport Beach and a few times here in Scottsdale.  On this particular night, I started my dinner with crab cake. It's large enough to share. They also have this on happy hours, it looks like I tend to order this crab cake at my every visit.  I had Hong Kong style Chilean Sea bass for dinner. The fish is steamed perfectly and goes well with the sauce. Fish served is quite large, hence the price charged makes sense. I think this was my favorite dish so far I tried.  Their wine selection is quite good.  On this particular night, I tried sequoia grove. It was quite good, I ended up having two glasses. Unfortunately wine was served rather chilled. I would have enjoyed it more if my wine was more closer to a room temperature.  Ambiance is so elegant. Good place to come for a quite evening. I've been here for happy hours as their happy hour price is much better. Not really meant for a large group. Service is always good except the last time I was there. My server was tending a large loud group and became a bit slow. Other staff was truly professional. As I was walking back from the restroom, I really like the way a staff stepped aside to let me through first. The way he did it was so elegant.  Oh, be sure to save room for desert. They have Godiva chocolate desert. Yes Godiva! Who doesn't love this fine Belgium chocolate? Godiva chocolate always bring a huge smile on me. Heavenly way to end your dinner (at least it did for me!)"}
{"text":"This is my second review.     The first was during happy hour, this time it's for dinner. Was going to order a glass of wine, but in the end we decided to get a bottle.    It was a 2011 cab.    Sorry.     I can't remember which one, and I don't see it on the online menu.    They brought warm bread and butter, which was a nice touch.      I'm not much of a bread person.     I tried it, and it was good.   We ordered the Pacific Ahi Tuna for myself, and he ordered the Pacific Swordfish for dinner and the Classic Caesar Salad to share.   My tuna was cooked and flavored to perfection.    It was lightly seared on the outside and the accompanying veggies were a perfect companion to the fish.    I don't normally like swordfish because I've always found it extremely dry.     Not in this case.    Moist and tender and most definitely they know how to give it the right seasoning to bring out its flavor.   The salad had the perfect mixture of dressing, and plated in the most elegant fashion for each of us.   The staff is friendly and oh so efficient.     The manager came over to ask how our meal was.    Always one to give my opinion, I told him it was one of the best I've had.      And, yes, I shall mention the hostess.     Of course, she was welcoming and prompt in placing us at a very good table."}
{"text":"I have found it quite hard to get good quality seafood here locally.  I have to give this place 5 stars for great seafood in the desert, it actually tastes fresh!  I recommend hitting this place up for their Happy Hour, and sit at the bar.  They offer a great happy hour menu which includes appetizers, main entrees, and drinks.  Most of this is Tappas style which is great, it gives you the opportunity to try different things and share amongst a group or even just two.    Portions here are pretty generous.  I highly recommend the Gulf Shrimp and the Sea Bass.  As far as sides, the twice baked potato is awesome and it's a freakin beast too!  Two of us couldn't even put a dent in it!  The wedge salad is really good too, especially the bleu cheese dressing that it comes with.  Atmosphere here is really great.  Pretty lively minus all the bro jocks and douche bags that frequent Scottsdale.  Service is great, and the bartenders are really cool especially when it's your first time there.  They will go thru the menu and make recommendations and just really put the time in.  Presentation is definitely not lacking at this place either.  As for price, it isn't cheap.  Each time we have been it has been right at about $100 for two, but that is including appetizers, entrees, and drinks.  Worth it in my opinion."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since they opened up as the first restaurant at Scottsdale Waterfront.  Great seafood, steaks, cocktails and wine.  Stopped by today for happy hour.  The calamari is awesome and you can't go wrong with the $5 glasses of wine.  Nice decor and great service.  Patrick the bartender is fantastic!"}
{"text":"We heard great things.  We were disappointed in the tuna tartar appetizer.  It didn't have the flavor that other places offer.  Seasons 52 had a much better, similar tuna appetizer.  If you are near the mall with a big group, it would be a reasonable option."}
{"text":"We have visited this location multiple times over the past few years. Each time has been a great experience. I booked my reservation through yelp w/ special requests and they did a fantastic job. Niko was our server and he was on point and took great care of  us. Thanks!!!!"}
{"text":"Review # 100 and I saved it for Wildfish, how cool is that?  So Friday night, after taking my friend, who was here from DC,  to Scottsdale Fashion Square so she could see what this mall was all about, we decided to head over to Wildfish. I mean I was just their a few weeks ago and I remembered just how yummy the food was at the event so I just had to go back.  The place was packed! I mean it was Friday night so I didn't expect anything less but wow. We had two choices, to either wait 45 mins for a table or grab a table near the bar. We choose the latter as the you still received the full menu at the bar as well.  We were greeted pretty quickly and our waitress, Deanna took great care of us. Hats off to you Deanna! You rocked girl.  My friend started off with a raspberry mojito I believe (I am not sure but I think that is what it was), Lobster Bisque and Snapper with Crab, the crab fried rice to share and some steamed asparagus. All I wanted was the calamari  so I ordered that as my main course. I know lame but that is all I had a taste for as I was saving room for dessert too.  So her drink, some warm fresh bread, and the lobster bisque came pretty quickly.  After that we are not sure what happened. One of the waiters (who by the way remembered me from the yelp event) came over to see how our meal was and we told him that we hadn't eaten yet. No sooner did we say that did our meal finally arrive. We were not upset by the delay at all as we were catching up on old times but it was a pretty long wait. However the manager Mario came over to apologize about the delay and offered to by us dessert. How cool was that. Deanna also came over to apologize as well for not checking on us sooner.   The meal was so good. My friend enjoyed hers and I chowed down on all that yummy calamari. It was a huge plate that was sitting on top vegetables, red chiles and some yummy but spicy cashews. I also had some of that crab fried rice which was also very good. Lots of crab and lots of mushrooms. Yummy.  To save room for dessert we ate as much as we could but then requested to pack up the rest so that we could enjoy the grand finale.  OMG! The desserts are sinful. My friend ordered the upside pineapple cake made with fresh whipped cream and vanilla bean ice cream, and I had the chocolate godiva cake that was served warm with vanilla bean ice cream. Good lawd those desserts were good. If you don't want anything else from this restaurant. which shame on you for not trying the delicious food, at least go for dessert. Yum, yum, yum.  All in all it was a great time. Thank you again to Deanna and huge extra special thank you to Mario for generously buying us dessert. I will definitely be back again soon."}
{"text":"Great seafood selection done exactly right.   Our friend is particular about vegetables and they satisfied her!  Broad wine selection too.  We'll return next year."}
{"text":"Excellent!  We went during happy hour and had the appetizers that were just filling enough. I had the bacon seafood chowder. Lots of potatoes and lobster and corn. Creamy base. Both Lois and I then had the crispy fried shrimp with red chili sauce on the side. It had a bit of a kick to it so a little goes a long way. But the shrimp had a light tempura batter fry and it was tasty without any sauce. We toasted with a glass of prosecco. The deserts looked lovely but we were full!  Dinner wise a little too pricey but for a light early dinner the appetizers make for a nice meal."}
{"text":"HHH! (Happy Hour Heaven!) Lots of different appitizers to choose from, ALL of them great. This is a packed place at night, inside and out. The outdoor patio is great for people and car watching. The calamarie was devine, crab cakes are a meal, oysters were oh oh good. Prices very cheap for the quantity and quality during happy hour. Love this fun hangout with a bunch of friends for drinks and eats. Very Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"We went there to try 75 cents Texas Gulf Oysters during happy hour. They were very fresh and delicious, especially with fresh horse radish.  After having a dozen and half oysters, we ordered spicy calamari with mixed vegetable and Ahi tartare.    The calamari was very tasty and we liked it very much   However, the Ahi tartare was very bland and had no flavor. The bartenders were attentive and friendly.    We will definitely return for more oysters."}
{"text":"I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, but I used to come to Scottsdale for work and vacation and I make it a point to come to the Wildfish Seafood Grille whenever I'm in town. I was in town for work and decided to go there for happy hour so I could get their jumbo crab cake (which I love) and the crab fried rice. I ordered a half portion of crab fried rice since I can only eat half and it was delicious as usual. The problem happened when Drew, my food server, brought my bill and the half portion of crab fried rice was $10. I thought I remembered paying $7 at both the Scottsdale and Newport Beach restaurants, so I got the menu and saw that the price for a full portion was $14. When I asked Drew why a half portion of rice was $10 versus $7, he suggested I speak with the manager. Joe came to my table and when I told him about my concern about the price of the rice, he told me that a half portion is really more than half and it is priced accordingly. He went into a long explanation about why the rice was priced the way it was and told me the price of the half order of rice was on the menu, but when I showed him only the $14 price listed, he finally said he could see why I expected the rice to be half the price of the full portion. He ended up taking the entire price of the fried rice off of my bill after we had discussed the matter for 5 minutes. Though I enjoyed my crab cake and crab fried rice, having a 5 minute conversation with Joe over a $3 difference in price was too long in my opinion. I usually have good customer service when I go to Wildfish, but I was very disappointed in how Joe handled this situation."}
{"text":"Delicious Chilean Sebass, excellent Mac n cheese, and a great wine selection but the service.... A little slow"}
{"text":"We came with a couple of friends and all of us really enjoyed the food and service.    There was a very large table seated next to us and the noise from that group was the one drawback.  The bread brought to the table was warm, fresh and delicious (probably ate too much of it).  We all started with the Heirloom Tomato Salads with Burrata.  This is the standard that all similar salads will be compared to.   Excellent!   I kept thinking about those tomatoes weeks later.    Our entrees - Scallops, Swordfish, Black Cod.   Everyone really enjoyed their choices.     Unfortunately we had no room for dessert (recall the bread comment!).       Service was professional, friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Wildfish delivered on an extremely happy 'happy hour' tonight to this girl...  The Wildfish chopped salad may be a new favorite - it has huge chilled fresh shrimp, heart of palm, tomato, avocado, bleu cheese, and walnuts - a light meal in itself!  Add a few of the .75 cent oysters, a glass of wine, a side of veggies or a bite of crabcake + some attentive service, and you're in for a real treat!  I'm not sure why I'm not more of a frequent Wildfish visitor... I look forward to another visit soon.  Happy hour is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!  Love this place.  Come here regularly!   Love the Blue Point oysters!    Pet peeve:  never have to worry about having plates, napkins, silverware or anything when you're appetizer arrives   Food is amazing! Service is amazing!   Great please"}
{"text":"Came here specifically in search of a good lobster tail and wasn't disappointed, but the highlight was my husband's steak au poivre with cracked black peppercorn cognac sauce! It was the best steak au poivre either of us have ever tasted, which is my husband's favorite we get all over town so we're becoming experts. I believe we also tried the truffled mac and cheese and a spicy ahi tuna roll which were very good!   I would eat this stuff every day if it didn't cost an arm and a leg. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I had the swordfish and was highly impressed with the flavours, my mom had the scallops and completely enjoyed it.  We both had the lobster/shrimp bisque soup which was very tasty.  The shrimp cocktail had great sauces.  The atmosphere is tasteful, and the wait staff very professional."}
{"text":"For a big room run by a corporate entity, this place runs stunningly smoothly and serves amazing food. The staff are all friendly, knowledgeable, and super professional. And again, for such a large establishment, the customer treatment is unexpectedly personal. I had the most amazing steamed sea bass in a light soy/sherry broth and my wife had the best crisp-roasted grouper we've found anywhere. The raw oysters were fresh, sweet, and crisp. Heirloom tomato salad and soft shell crab salad with arugula, heirlooms, and blue cheese was to die for. Wonderful Rhone white from Paso Robles and a nice molten dark chocolate cake capped off a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were a littler nervous about finding good fresh seafood in Arizona.  We were extremely surprised with Wildfish.  The service was amazing to start off with.  But their food and menu was fantastic.  Everything that our party of 6 ordered was exactly what we ordered, how we asked for it, and tasty.  I would recommend this place for anyone looking for fresh fish in Arizona!"}
{"text":"This was the place to be 7 years ago but now things have changed.  My husband and I had brunch their was friends on Mother's Day.    Boy, was I excited, there was prefix brunch menu and my mouth was beginning to water.    First, was an order of deviled eggs.   One is a slice of salmon,  a slice of truffle and caviar.  They were all amazing.   Then we had another starter of cinnamon roll, which were warm but not piping hot like cinnamon rolls should be.    Both my husband and I ordered shrimp with grits. It had a pouched eggs on top.    Noooooooo! Why don't I like it. The grits were sticky and pastey.  Grits are suppose to be  light and smooth.... why can't people get it right.  If you say you make shrimp and grits , then make shrimp and grits , not a different version of it.    Why can't restaurant's  stay true the authenticity of a classic dish.   Dessert was okay but no memorable.  I wanted a memorable Mother's day dish and I was truly disappointed.     Can I get a do-over!"}
{"text":"This is one of the few places in the Valley that our whole little family will ALWAYS agree upon to go to for dinner.   Our children are ages 9 and 16 so there's even great things for them to eat that the chef can make especially for the little one.  Our eldest usually just eats from the regular menu.    We have not had their sushi or oysters but have heard they are tasty.  Our faves from the apps menus are: the jumbo lump crab cake (that remoulade sauce is incredible)**this is a must try**, the point judith calamari (has an asian theme that will blow your tongue away), and crispy salt and pepper shrimp.   Of the Second Courses, we have had the fabulous maine lobster and shrimp bisque**this is a must try**, the fuji apple salad, classic caesar salad, and the baby iceberg BLT.  Ok as far as steaks and seafood go, we havw had so many, we would highly recommend most of them.  I personally really enjoy the swordfish and the chilean sea bass.  Of the beef, I recommend the filet mignon and ribeye.  Now, the sides, the crab fried rice with mushrooms are the bomb! Truffled mac and cheese, parm and chive french fries and the sauteed spinach are also quite good.    Lastly, let's cove the service and ambiance.  Every time we've been to Wildfish everyone from the hostess, server, busser, to the bartender(s) have been excellent.  We have hardly ever had a wait.  The music is always nice and relaxing.  You really can't go wrong with a romantic date night with your loved one, someone you're dating, your family, or a medium or large group."}
{"text":"Wildfish is a go to restaurant for my family, though recently it's been losing its flair for me. We started in the bar and tried the Salt and Pepper Shrimp which was delicious, just wished they offered it in a bigger portion and on the main menu. Appetizers always include their calamari as it is one of my favorite places to get Calamari from and the bread they bring out with the seasoned salt over the butter is amazing! Crab Cakes and Potstickers and good as well, though the filling of the potstickers was a bit dry. My go to for an entree is the Crab Stuffed Shrimp. It is super rich but equally balanced by the briny tomato and onion mixture on top. I included pictures of entrees that others with me ate and heard good reviews! I would say always say room for dessert at Wildfish as they are all delicious! My favorite is the chocolate lava cake . Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Living in Newport Beach before moving to Scottsdale we frequented Wildfish on a weekly basis. The crab cakes are my favorite. Moving from FL I am VERY particular & these are Devine !! Therefore we were excited to try the Scottsdale location. As it turned out to be restaurant week ( we had no clue ) the bar tender raves about their filets. I would normally never order meat at Wildfish. Firstly I am not a huge meat eater & it has to be fabulous & I love fish & seafood. Which unfortunately is hard to find here. BUT I ordered the restaurant week dinner because it was such a great daily. Originally I ordered the first sh special & it was really DRY.  YUCK. The manager came over & switched it out for a filet. I was not expecting anything great & already regretting I didn't order the crab cakes. To my delight the filet was fabulous !! As well as the scalloped potatoes. !! Flaming bananas foster was beyond great . I would never hesitate to order a filet again from here. Cheers to this great restaurant!! :)"}
{"text":"We visit once a year from new york and look forward to eating here.  The scallops melt in your mouth.  The service is attentive and the whole experience is rewarding."}
{"text":"Went to happy hour after having gone there a few years ago and thought it was too expensive.  But the beauty of happy hour is that is reasonable.  We bought 3 dishes and only needed 2.  Whereas most places charge you $5 for some appretizer, it's usually small so you wind up buying more.  The Salt and Pepper Shrimp came with several large shrimp and was excellent!  The Pan Seared Tuna was also excellent.  Nice atmosphere, older crowd, great drinks, excellent wait staff, etc.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"We can't go wrong with Duckhorn red zin. It's a great price and pairs well with almost any dish. My boyfriend has the Gatsby Sour, which we highly recommend one rock and slightly less sour when ordered.   We started out with the truffle steak tartar & main lobster tacos. They were born to die for. As we were halfway through our first course, the chef was kind enough to let us taste a sample of their pistachio crusted- elderflower infused goat cheese. What a great!   For entrees we ordered the swordfish steak and I originally was going to have just the king crab legs. Boy was I lucky tonight, because they had a special on the crab legs which included two diver scallops and two stuffed shrimp. The swordfish was juicy and tenderly cooked to perfection. My king crag leg special was beyond delicious. We ended up having some leftovers :).   Charles was our server and was outstanding.  He was contentious of when to approach and leave our table to be. In addition, he was exceptionally patient with our coursing indulgences.   For the first time my boyfriend has been here, he was impressed. I have not been here in a few year, and am very impressed by the seafood quality and selection."}
{"text":"It is difficult to only give this fabulous restaraunt 5 stars when they desreve 20!! We dine here each week. It is near our home and we can guarantee excellent service every time!! The seafood is delicious, the steaks are perfect every time and the waitstaff is trained to the be attentive, courteous and prompt. A bonus is, if you happen to like blackberry cobbler with a thin crust and creamy vanilla ice cream for dessert, you are in for a treat!"}
{"text":"Been going here for several years.  Place is in process of changing name/owner/menu or something, none of the staff knows what is going on.  Anyway, calamari has always been great and well worth a visit, but no more.  Now calamari consists of more white fluff filler, less pieces of calamari and it's a real hunt to find cashews in there somewhere.  Cost cutting? New Chef? Don't know, but hope they reverse the trend and get back to what made them good.  It's slipping in both food department and service department."}
{"text":"A couple of weeks ago I had the most amazing dinner at Wildfish.  My apologies for not getting this review in sooner.    Staff - Raul our server was very nice and professional.  His knowledge of the menu was spot-on.  We noticed the chef speaking with all the waiters when we arrived this is a great detail for all restaurants to follow.  Enrique the chef knows what he is doing.  Every item we ordered was spot on (more on our food in a minute).    Our busboy Adam was also very professional and made sure our table was clean and plates taken away as we finished each course.  Even the GM Damon came to our table to see how things were going.  It is obvious he cares about the restaurant and it's customers.  I am very impressed with the staff!  Atmosphere - Low lighting and relaxed.  Very clean restaurant.  Food - DELICIOUS!  My significant other and I ordered many dishes.  The Lump Crab Cake was soooo good.  Unlike many other restaurants this was a true lump crab cake.  The remoulade sauce was perfect.  The caprese salad was created with  fresh ingredients.  I ordered the CHILEAN SEA BASS which was Pan roasted with lemon and garlic butter.  My sig. other ordered the Swordfish.  Both were cooked to perfection.  The pineapple upside down cake was also delicious.  I took home the truffle mac and cheese for lunch the next day.  All I can say was MMMMMMMMMMM!  Cost - Our total bill was $150 plus tip.  To some this may sound expensive.  However, I encourage everyone to look again at everything ordered.  Price it out, and then include the cost of excellent service, not having to cook these items yourself, and definitely not having to clean up.  Keep in mind the degree of difficulty getting good quality seafood to the desert.  I left a generous tip as I feel the meal and experience of dining at this restaurant was definitely worth every single penny!  Thank you Wildfish and all the staff for an excellent meal!  I will definitely see you again!"}
{"text":"This was the first restaurant I had been to in Phoenix, and I must admit I was impressed.  I went with a few partners (and they picked up the bill) so I can't comment if the food was worth the price; so, this review is based purely on the food and not the value.  Nevertheless this a solid three stars.  My fish was actually wild and not farm raised, which is rare in  phoenix.  The crab cakes though, were a let down -- too much bread and not a lot of crab.  The wine list wasn't very impressive, even their pricier bottles. Plus the place was cougared out, which always makes for a good laugh."}
{"text":"We just ate here tonight. Amazingly fresh seafood, delicious flavors, and the server was great. We so enjoyed our time there. As far a prices go, we felt that the amount we paid for an appetizer, two entrees, one small side, and desert was quite fair for the amount of food and the fact that it was delicious.The Godiva Chocolate Lava Cake melted in your mouth, and I don't even like chocolate!  Our server instructed us that portions were generous and so when ordering a small side, that it would be plenty for two, which it was. Sliding doors were slid back so that you could enjoy the ambiance of the outdoors. Music was nice and not so loud that you couldn't talk to each other. We would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and the service is amazing ! Whole experience on point and I highly recommend the swordfish !"}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated a big anniversary out of town so we looked to Yelp to help find us a great place to celebrate.  We decided on the Wildfish Seafood Grille. IT WAS GREAT!!  We informed the hostess it was our anniversary and we were seated at a table that had a place card congratulating us and a tabletop full of red roses. We were congratulated by every staff member that interacted with us including the bus boys.  Our server was attentive and more importantly knowledgeable about the food. The chef prepared a special sushi sampler for us to try on the house. All of these attention to details were much appreciated and I would guess that a relatively comparable experience would be given to you as a \"normal\" dinner.  THE FOOD: I would give you the exact names of the menu items we had as well as the prices but THE WEBSITE IS TERRIBLE!! Please stop with the flash site and lack of menu, Eddie V's restaurant Inc.  Anyways.... We started with a spicy tuna roll which was good, and well worth the price.  For our entrees we had a Chilean Sea bass  baked in a white garlic sauce. For those conscious about over fishing this may not be the fish for you. I didn't realize until after dinner that the fish is labeled avoid for over fishing =( But for those who don't care, it was very tasty.  My husband had Red Fish and he greatly enjoyed it. I'm sure the butter had nothing to do with it (Wink, wink).  Together we shared a twice backed potato (small on the menu is more than enough for two.) The potato was heavenly whipped with butter & topped with cheese and bacon bits.... You can't beat that heart attack combo.   The best part of the evening was the Upside Down Pineapple Cake. It was the best I have ever eaten. This is saying a lot coming from me.... I have lots of southern family members that can bake us out of a war.  My husband usually hates Pineapple Cake so he opted for a chocolate cake. He tasted my cake after seeing it lite on fire by the waiter. Apparently a pyro will eat anything with flames. To his surprise he loved the Pineapple Upside Down Cake!!  All in all the meal was amazing and I would recommend this seafood haven in the middle of the desert any time."}
{"text":"I was there Friday 4/4. I love the food and the fact that the portions are normal.  I gave it only 4 stars since the girls in the front are clueless, and need more attention to detail and customers, you do not let your customers \"dry\" out and try to figure when they will be seated, there a re three of you, so one should should check on the customer and talk to them!!!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent.  Waiter was very helpful with reccomendations.  Calamari app was good but much spicier than I thought (and I love spicy!)  We were heare on vacation so brought our toddler with us and it wasn't a great atmosphere / speed for him.  We didn't get to enjoy the meal/dining experience as much as we would have liked, but not any fault of the staff or restaurant.  Would love to go back for a nice adult dinner out :)"}
{"text":"I travel alot and this is one of the top experiences of the year!! Drew our waiter was amazing, friendly, and knowledgable. The food was outstanding and the cocktails were perfect."}
{"text":"This restaurant can do no wrong in my opinion. Great happy hour, nice ambiance and a great staff. I've been here a few times and I always order the mac&cheese which is hands down the best I've ever had! I can't come here without ordering it. If you love mac&cheese like I do, or even if you aren't a big fan of it, come here to have your tastebuds blown away!"}
{"text":"Ahh, springtime on a patio for Malibu Rum Barbie. But somehow, I just can't escape being right up at the bar in this darkened cave :) The bartenders are generous with the pours... although the happy hour drink specials are already quite decent.   Appetizers are priced very nicely. My friend had oysters for less than a buck each. I couldn't eat them. Too slimy for me but he said they were absolutely delicious. I prefer the beef on the hot stone and it's done medium rare, of course. The shrimp cocktail is good. All in all, they do a nice job on the both presentation and taste. The only thing I've had at Wildfish that doesn't quite live up to my standards is the bisque. After living in San Fran and eating down at the pier... what can I say?? I'm a bisque snob :)   Good job to Wildfish and their staff. Always a very enjoyable place to visit!!"}
{"text":"Wasn't super impressed. The seafood was alright, but for the price I would expect it to be amazing. Wouldn't ever come back."}
{"text":"Just finished my second trip and this restaurant  and all I can say is it's amazing. Probably one of the top 5 in the area.  Very extensive wine menu at reasonable prices for a high end restaurant. I highly recommend the lobster and steak tartare. I also had the scallops which had an amazing fruit garnish as well. No matter the occasion this restaurant will not let you down."}
{"text":"Just spent the most amazing Easter Brunch on the patio! Wonderful service, special request Pete he's the perfect server, to die for food, and well portioned servings. One of the best meals I've had in Arizona! Get the bananas foster for dessert it's a perfect ending to a fantastic meal!"}
{"text":"Oysters and tuna steak were both delicious and  very fresh.  Staff was very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"The ribeye melts in your mouth.  The lobster mashed potatoes are out of this world.  The filet and lobster was amazing!  Try the bananas foster!  Amazing food and fabulous service!!"}
{"text":"Mr. W and I have been together since HS and since the beginning of our time together, we found the best way to handle a disagreement was through a fair game of Paper, Rock, Scissors (if either of us were very passionate about the issue the game went best two out of three) Well, here we are some 23 years later and although we've grown to understand not all problems can be settled by PRS, our \"where should we eat?\" Battles are mostly settled this way.  While in Scottsdale, I wanted to try the Monarch and he wanted Wildfish ... I threw scissors he threw a rock. Foiled!  So Wildfish it was and what a spectacular dinner we had!  Perhaps it was the intimate yet open restaurant with its huge wine list and oyster bar, or maybe it was the romantic semi-circular booth we sat at that caused us to be closer together, most likely it was the over-the-top service from our waiter Dave that had us smiling and praising the Wildfish Restaurant.  First let's start with location: Wildfish is located On the Outside of Fashion Square with beautiful outdoor seating and decorative welcoming doors. There is $6 valet parking available but DIRECTLY across valet is a large self parking garage. We parked it and walked. Easy peasy.  Second, the hostess stand was double staffed which meant no waiting to be greeted or seated.  Once seated our server went straight to the explanation of the menu and the specials. He gave us some space and time to soak it all in and make a decision ... Dave, our server was close enough to hear our convo regarding starters, 1st & 2nd courses and he immediately chimed in ... \" go with the crab-cake! No fillers just pure juicy lumps of crab with an amazing creme sauce\"  So, we did and we loved it. Big enough to share and we also shared the creamy lobster and shrimp bisque perfect for dipping your fresh baked table bread in.  Hubby ordered the Hong Kong style Chilean Sea Bass and I the filet mignon done at a perfect medium rare. We kind of shared the main entrees as well but not really lol and the best part of it all was the wine! Yet another recommendation from our server!  Before leaving Dave comes out with this oven baked blackberry cobbler topped with vanilla bean ice cream and says, \" from me to you both for being so in love I wanted to puke\" that's just made us die from LOL-ing also written in chocolate \" Happy Anniversary\" for sometime this year he said. Loved it!  So if in the Scottsdale area and looking for a steak and seafood joint don't do the common places be wild and try Wildfish!  A 5 star best we ever had fine dining extravaganza!"}
{"text":"In my opinion this is the best fresh fish restaurant in the valley. Their steamed sea bass is unbelievably delicious. They have a large wine selection and a decent sushi bar. Their happy hour is reasonable and they have a good appetizer menu. It's a comfortable and nice looking facility and I've always had good service. There is valet parking but i dont think they validate. There is convenient free underground parking. This restaurant is part of the Eddy V's group and has a similar look, feel and energy."}
{"text":"Holy Moly, the BEST seafood I've had in the middle of the desert. Truly fresh and absolutely tasty.   They even accommodated our toddler - and this isn't the best place for a 2 year old to dine, but we didn't have a choice that night. Kevin W. provided excellent service with his professionalism, flexibility and kindness. He helped us navigate the menu, and put up with our kid.   Our meal was almost $300, but worth every penny. We'll be back often.   You must go!"}
{"text":"\"I will remember these shrimp for the rest of my life.\"  This is what my mom said after tasting the bacon-wrapped shrimp at Wildfish.  I knew I had to come back for a full meal after swooning over the amazing appetizers at the Yelp Elite event.  So, when my mom came out to visit I had the perfect opportunity to prove that great seafood can be found in the desert.  Wildfish did not disappoint.  After consulting with our (super awesome) waiter Christian, we started off with two appetizers - the crabcake and the bacon-wrapped shrimp with goat cheese.  Both were just as fantastic as I remembered.  The crabcake is large and perfect for sharing and is served with a light remoulade sauce.  The shrimp come three to a plate, complimented with a small stack of light onion rings.  My mom really knows that I love her, as I declined her (feeble and halfhearted) offers to split the third shrimp with me!  The parade of deliciousness continued with the entrees - Roasted Sea Bass and Snapper Filet with Johah Crab.  Both were served with delicate sauces that enhanced, not overpowered, the flavor of the fish.  We shared a side of steamed asparagus with hollandaise.  All sides are served family-style and the portions are large but can be ordered in half sizes that are perfect for two.  5 star staff, 5 star food.  Overall it was a great experience in every way."}
{"text":"What a great place to eat when you are celebrating!! Group of girlfriends enjoyed a dinner and had lots of choices from a LOADED menu. The appetizers we selected were crab cakes and potstickers- both were good, but the crab cakes were the MUST. Among the entrees that we tried were the filets over asparagus, salmon and shrimp en oreganette ( totally spelled wrong!). All were delicious, and came out piping hot. We ordered sides to share, waiter advised us that large aides would feed about 3. Tried Crab and mushroom fried rice, truffle Mac and cheese, Brussels sprouts, and potatoes at gratin. Again, amazing!! Our recommendation would be, go to this place hungry, and be prepared to be pampered."}
{"text":"Appetizers galore...and all so, so good.  I'm sworn to the Ahi Tuna Tartar, which easily serves two.   Probably 18 visits in the last six months, mostly during happy hour.  PROS:  Appetizers.  Staff.  Staff uniforms.  Lighting.  Drink selection.  Menu diversity.  LOCATION = the BOMB!  Vast majority of entrees dependably excellent.  CONS:  Not exactly dirt cheap.  Some of the big ticket, prime items have disappointed me (Chilean Sea Bass wasn't that great, I even questioned its authenticity), but I still tend to order with confidence.  Perhaps a bit too much \"corporate\" design in both the menu and interior - sure, it was well thought out and very well executed (you don't get to park your restaurant in the Waterfront otherwise!)  The question is....where's the creativity, the uniqueness?"}
{"text":"First time at a seafood restaurant. Great atmosphere and customer service. Although emphasis on customer service. Maybe a little too busy bodied."}
{"text":"Prime aged steaks, fresh seafood, great service and great location in the Waterfront Scottsdale area.  Even had a call the day after from the restaurant to make sure everything was up to expectations.  First class.  It was a little more expensive than I was expecting though.  Not to say that it wasn't worth it but 1 app, 2 entrees, 3 glasses of wine, dessert = 150+ with tip.  Great food though."}
{"text":"Scottsdale, AZ- Very good food. Seafood tower was good, swordfish, cole and sea bass were good. The sides were delicious, but it was all very filling and we did not finish most of the sides. Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"I recently went to Wildfish for a special occasion. To say my experience was amazing won't be due justice. I will go over the highlights.  Decor- Wildfish has a beautiful entrance. Outside seating to wait, and outside dining with amazing table top decor. Once inside, the bar is beautifully centered with high end vodka on top lining the lights above it. The tables are clothed in white, very upscale. I could write a review just on the decor.   Customer Service- We had Nicco as our server, and he was by far very professional. He sat us, thanked us for joining them for our special event, and gave us water immediately. He spoke of the specials and gave us amazing tips and descriptions. If he is your server, you'll be taken care of.  Food- I had the Chilean sea bass, which literally melted in my mouth. Beautifully cooked, seasoned, and the plating couldn't be any better. We also had the crab cake and salmon special. Seriously amazing food quality for the price point.  Price- For a shared app, two entrees, and a side, our check was around $114 dollars. May seem steep, but the whole experience is beyond perfection.   Overall- For a perfect night of food, atmosphere, and service, you need to visit here. Make sure to book a reservation ahead!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last weekend with a couple friends and loved it. We had some kind of beef on a hot stone and it was so good we ordered more of it. I had the sole for dinner and it was the best I've ever had. I will be back."}
{"text":"Good wine selection. Oysters were okay, not the best I've had but not the worst. We ordered the Boston oysters and the British Columbia oysters (Boston was so much better). Great service, but a bit pricy"}
{"text":"The food was good. The chicken tortilla soup, not so much. The filet mignon was very tender, asparagus were very tasty. The guacamole was very authentic. My favorite was the dessert, pecan pie!"}
{"text":"We went to Wildfish for Valentine's Day...I was a little hesitant at first because for some reason I'd never heard anyone talk about it & I'm always a teeny bit wary of seafood restaurants anyway. I used to work in one...I think I'm scarred for life.  I had no reason to worry here. I ate SO much here...& everything I put in my mouth was totally delicious.  A manager started us off with a huge slice of cucumber topped with this delicious salmon stuff...as a welcome as first-timers in the restaurant. Now THAT is a way to get people coming back. That is huge for me. Such a nice surprise.  We ordered a few sides as our appetizer. The boy got the truffle fries (we know how I feel about fries...I had to hold myself back). I ordered asparagus (perfectly cooked & just barely seasoned, I could eat that forever) & we split the truffled mac n cheese. OHHH. That stuff is so gosh darn good...I wanted a whole pot to myself. But we split it, so I didn't gain 5 pounds on the spot.  Boytoy ordered the filet, oscar-style. They had to take it back for him to cook it a little more, but I think he just doesn't know what he likes. They were super nice & very fast bringing it back to him (with a little flashlight to check how well it was done!) He says it was one of the best steaks he has had in awhile. He also ordered a twice-baked potato with it that was just cheesy deliciousness.   I ordered the ahi, because it seemed to be one of the more creatively prepared meals on the menu, & their ahi is wild...so I could eat it with a clear conscious (see below). The wasabi mashed potatoes that came with it made me laugh out loud. So good...who thought of that?! I just wish I had eaten less beforehand so I could have eaten more of my meal (seared rare fish isn't as good microwaved).  My wine was good, our server was good...a little timid at times, but that was fine. We like to play around a little at dinner...I like a server who can hold their own, but all in all, a great special occasion dinner. It was a little pricey, but it's the Waterfront.   ***DISCLAIMER: TREEHUGGER***I will say, they lost a star really only for having a selection of fish that was mostly on my ECO-WORST list! Fish is a tricky business lately. I will spare you the environmental lecture & just leave you with this: restaurants (especially in areas not close to the source) buy fish as cheaply as possible, which usually means fish that are dwindling in population (Chilean sea bass, etc) or collected in the wrong ways that kill other marine life or damage ecosystems (many kinds of tuna,etc). Just ask where your the fish you're ordering comes from. If the server doesn't know or obviously makes something up...you're in trouble anyway."}
{"text":"Ambiance /aesthetics of the restaurant are average at best; it lacks elegance and distinction. That is not a problem of course if food and service are outstanding, but that is not the case here.  The service was adequate but our waiter was not knowledgeable about the menu (or food and beverages in general) and hence unable to make useful recommendations. If he was still in training, one would expect him to be accompanied by a more seasoned colleague - that would be the norm for a restaurant serving fare in this price range.   One of our party ordered the sea bass (after reading rave reviews about it here on Yelp) and although it was served on top of a tasty broth, the fish itself was completely flavorless. The chef would be wise to pour that broth over the fish while cooking.  The lobster bisque was highly mediocre (for a great lobster bisque, try A Different Pointe of View at Pointe Hilton), and the blue cheese in both the olives in my martini (brought to the table the first time with a lemon twist by the way, even though the cocktail menu specifically listed it as a blue-cheese stuffed olive martini) and as well on the wedge salad, was simply too pungent. Cheese that intense destroys enjoyment of other flavors. What can be done with blue cheese that is overpowering? Mix it with a milder cheese. But our overall impression was that no one is tasting the food before sending it out at Wildfish. And clearly no one is taking the time to fully develop the wait staff.   * A note again regarding our waiter and the cocktails at this restaurant... Our server had clearly received little to no training and lacked even a basic familiarity with fine dining concepts. He actually offered to leave the martini with the lemon twist at our table and simply return with olives. And I had ordered it \"slightly dirty!\" LOL! Worse: the martini he did bring back, while bearing the correct garnish, was among the worst blue cheese olive martinis I have ever tasted.  I will say that the lobster tail was good for Phoenix (difficult to find truly sweet, tender lobster here) but that alone is not enough to compensate for the myriad issues we experienced. For the price, I can't recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"First off, I am sorry that it has taken me so long to write this review.  I visited Wildfish on two occasions this past Spring. I love the ambiance and vibe of the restaurant.  The whole staff is so warm, friendly and professional.  The food is great too! I recall having a steak, steamed vegetables and a salad.  Everything was perfect and delicious.  My friend and I felt so special because the General Manger, Mr. Damon Hovannisian came over and spoke with us. He wanted to ensure that we were receiving good service and that our food was good . . .everything was great!  I like this restaurant for so many different reasons, one plus is the parking. There is plenty of free parking very close to the restaurant; I also like the location right in the heart of Old Town. This a great place for first dates or any event.  I will be back soon."}
{"text":"This review if for their happy hour because that's all that I've experienced.  Love that they have happy hour all night on Sundays and Mondays.  I live close by and used to frequent Wildfish often for happy hour.  I usually get the crab cake and lobster bisque."}
{"text":"Happy hour at Wildfish a nice way to do it.  $2 off drinks, about $3-$5 off a number of small plates and appetizers, and a few entrees.  The calamari appetizers is my favorite anyplace - too large for one unless you treat it as an entree, lots of nice fried calamari, rice noodles, julienne veggies with a nice, moderately spicy sauce.  Salad selections at happy hour also terrific - apple and greens and a nice shrimp salad. My wife enjoyed her two fish tacos.  You can order off main menu as well, and do we shared lobster bisque - very good. Only ordering off the happy menu (plus bisque) was plenty of food, especially with the bread basket."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant and I was not that impressed. I ordered the Chilean sea bass and it was quite bland! The happy hour isn't bad but they need to season their food a bit more!"}
{"text":"Hostess with the leastest...  We walked in at 1040 last night (closing time is 11) only to be told by the hostess that the everything would be shut down at 11pm and that's what her manager told her to say.  So, I say 1 star!  You're open until 11pm unless someone wants to eat I guess."}
{"text":"Crab stuffed grilled shrimp and bananas foster...WOW.  You can come here in a suit or jeans.  Great bar and fantastic wine selection."}
{"text":"Stopped in to celebrate with a treat. Lobster bisque is great, also had 2 9oz lobster tails, pricy but cooked to perfection. Service is perfect, atmosphere is great, pop music did not seem to fit."}
{"text":"Maybe it was an off day for the chef...but our food was incredibly underwhelming. Only one person in our group said they enjoyed their meal, but caveated that it wasn't special, just \"good.\"  Not impressive given how expensive Wildfish is - one would expect much higher levels of satisfaction.  I started with the crab and corn chowder, which was flavorless and surprisingly very watery.  I would think the smoked bacon would have added some depth to the soup, but it didn't appear there was any bacon in the chowder.  Needless to say, we had 8 people in our party and I passed the bowl around...there was still at least half of the chowder left - no one wanted a second taste.  I had the Seared Pacific Ahi tuna for my entree. Cooked fine at rare. However, the star of the dish was the side - the mango salad. It was bright, citrus-y and a great complement to the slab of tuna next to it.  Others in our party had the following and universally shrugged their shoulders in indifference when asked how they enjoyed their meal:  Scottish Salmon (my dad), Shrimp and Crab chopped salad (my mom), Scallops (my sister & brother), Filet Mignon & Crab (my best friend - he did say he enjoyed his steak), Jumbo Gulf Shrimp (my wife), and Halibut (my brother-in-law).  We also ordered a couple of sides:  the Crab fried rice - overwhelmingly salty. I couldn't eat a 2nd bite. We were all very surprised how salty it was.  I was told this was my brother and sister's favorite dish - they even noted it was saltier than usual.  Also ordered the truffled mac & cheese and parmesan & chives french fries - both were ok.  Would very much like to come back since it appears that it's typically a very good place for seafood.  But for the price, I'm reluctant to spend that much money again for a 2nd chance.  Service was very good and attentive overall.  Our waiter forgot the mac & cheese originally, but comped us for the mishap."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! This place is a solid 4 stars. I came here for happy hour with my friend and husband and I sure did leave happy (full and happy)!   Pro:  - fresh oysters  - clean ingredients  - clean and appetizing presentation of food  - beautiful ambiance, a very chill environment  - reasonable prices! This is very important to me.  - their fish never smell fishy   Cons:  - the portions for their dinner menu are smaller in portion size.  - a very limited drink options for happy hour   Service:  - fast  -friendly  - the servers dress up in their tux vests. It gives the service a very upscale and classy vibe.  - very accommodating servers and bartenders - manager checks in with you during their dinner service  Overall, I recommend this place because of their pronominal service and fresh seafood.  Please let me know if you have any questions about this place!"}
{"text":"We hit this place after a long day of shopping.  I liked this place.  I am always seeking out seafood options and there are many here.  The tuna tartar could have used more flavor.  The sea bass was buttery and served in a delicate white wine sauce....really good.  There are so many things that looked good on the menu, I will be back again to try something new."}
{"text":"What a wonderful time at Wildfish tonight!  The bartenders treated us so special in honor of my friends birthday!  Free dessert and birthday shot!"}
{"text":"5 Stars  One Dish  Chilean Sea bass Steamed \"Hong Kong Style\" with Soy, Sherry and Ginger  Thats it!"}
{"text":"Came here for Happy Hour and it was excellent. I had flavored $5 martinis, 75-cent oysters (which were amazingly fresh), 1/2 off their meaty, lumpy crabcakes and 1/2 off a gigantic plate of calamari. They don't open until 4:00 pm and that is my only drawback - that I can't sit there all day gorging myself and getting hammered..."}
{"text":"Just had to kill some time before catchin' the flight back to Denver, and was explicit about having only drinks. The empty restaurant-- at 4pm-- would not accommodate sitting four of us at any location, even one that was reserved for, say, 6pm and we had a flight to catch and would bounce if someone showed up an hour early.  Equally inflexible was their short happy hour menu, not offering anything veggie for my conference-friend who didn't eat meat (and who wholly loathes reservations as an Australian; I wanted to include many, many lines and anecdotes of his, but...)  Finally, my barman-- nice guy-- kept offering things they were out of, like rose wine. I also wasn't really feelin' how we were both hyped they offered a gluten-free vodka so I could enjoy the $6 happy hour martini, but my man brings a check with a regular $12 martini (or three); this was Tito's, yo-- it's $20 a bottle and nobody ain't foolin' nobody.  Best line from she-beaux: \"Ill-fitting white jackets: kill me.\"  I got the feeling this was a place that wants and/or attracts a certain clientele-- take a casual walk by first and have a gander in; you'll know it when you see it."}
{"text":"Desiring a good meal and preferring seafood, our VALET recommended Wildfish . . . Great recommendation! The Chilean Sea Bass was almost as good as to what I'm accustomed, the calamari appetizer was excellent. I had struggled with the mediocre meals we had experienced in Scottsdale, but this did not disappoint. The meals were a little more pricey, but considering everything is flown in fresh - you get what you pay for! Along with great food, the ambience was romantic, quiet, relaxing and our waiter was professional and hospitable. They do no have a \"children's menu\", but they do have a few select items for children plus they will tailor any of their menu items for their younger patrons."}
{"text":"I just relocated here but have already been to Wildfish twice in the past 2 weeks, The food is fresh, very well prepared and there are quite a few nice selections on the menu. What I appreciate the most is the service. The restaurant and bar are crowded and energetic, yet the service still feels very personal. Jorge was efficient, knowledgable, but most of all genuine and friendly. Made for a great dining experience.   This will be at the top of our list for dining with friends & visitors."}
{"text":"Classic Scottsdale locale - near a mall, full of Large breasted (surgically enhanced) Cougars, full of spoiled 20-year-olds, pretty good and overpriced seafood.  They have a packed and fun happy hour with good deals.  What's not to love?"}
{"text":"Fish in the desert is a tricky proposition. You're going to pay more for quality and that's what happens up at Wildfish. It's pricey but solid food.  If you're in the area around happy hour time they do have some great apps and drinks on special.  The service was terrific.  The only thing that bothered me was how tight everything was.  If you're at the bar there is constant traffic behind you people cluttered around to order."}
{"text":"This place is LEGIT! The whole experience was perfect. The atmosphere (at night at least) is definitely a place for a romantic evening. The lighting is dim, music playing was jazz, the service was A+ and the FOOD....Bomb! lol   We started with some martinis and ordered crab cakes, which was ALL CRAB. Next we had some oysters. For our main course we had the Sea Bass (Hong Kong style) and the halibut (over cooked pork shank) - both these dishes which were recommended, were perfect. We ended our meal with some Creme Brulee.   Great place, will be coming again for another special occasion."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and plenty of delicious meals.  The happy hour is awesome....one of the best calamari I have tried as well as their crab cakes.  Great drink specials and the staff is also very friendly."}
{"text":"The food, service, and atmosphere were impeccable! Even the water was exceptional! My husband had lobster tails that were the best I'd ever tasted. The crab fried rice is a must-try!"}
{"text":"1) eat on the patio 2) bring your appetite The lobster tacos are fabulous. The sea bass is great it's a perfect piece of fish and they prepare it nicely without trying to overwhelm you they let the fish stand on its own as they should. I would love to try the black cod but it has mushrooms which I abhor so it's not in the cards. The crab fried rice was a little overdone. The Mac and cheese was yummy the lobster mashed are to die for. The calamari was great but there isn't much on the plate but it's in a yummy Kung Pao sauce. The filet was sooooooo good which you don't always expect knowing that this isn't a steak house it's a fish house. I didn't really try any desserts but  he recommend the bananas foster."}
{"text":"Since moving back to the Valley of the Sun, I have had a hard time finding both good and fresh seafood. It's one of the few things my little heart is broken over since leaving LA. Traffic on the 405 nope, don't miss that a bit... The better than thou attitudes and the plastic LA scene, nope, can't say I miss that either... But having access to super fresh seafood is something this girl misses... ALOT!  So last night when this chick was craving some fresh oysters and fantastic seafood... I was at a loss as to where to go, that was until Wildfish Seafood Grille was suggested. I thought sure, why not, haven't been there but frankly wasn't expecting to be wowed. Made a quick reservation through open table on my trusty Yelp app on my iphone and off we were to Wildfish!   Once we arrived we were greeted by 3 super friendly hostesses and were promptly sat in a comfortable booth, Our server Charles was quick to the table to take our drink order and was both knowledgable of the menu but also friendly, funny and engaging and was never too intrusive during our meal. It's rare that you find both good food and service so out of this world that it makes you want to go back and dine there every night of the week, but Wildfish delivered the good food and Charles delivered the stellar service!   We started off with a dozen oysters, which were fresh and delicious. Only complaint was that there were a few chunks of shells in several of my oysters but it happens. I can't wait to come back for more delicious and fresh oysters ASAP!   Being torn between 3 different entrees, I looked to Charles for his suggestion. He suggested (The Sea bass) and boy he was seriously just spot on. The Chilean Sea Bass is steamed Hong Kong Style served in a light soy broth. The fish was not only super fresh, but it was cooked to perfection and the soy broth perfectly balanced the dish. It would be hard to ever go there and order a different entree after eating that! They had a scallop dish that was a special that particular evening and they were smaller scallops served with roasted grapes, that dish was also quite delicious and I thought the grapes were an interesting addition. We ordered two small sides, The Brussels sprouts and the sautéed spinach, both good but the Brussels Sprouts were the real standout. We finished off our meal with their delicious bananas foster butter cake with butter pecan ice cream ( I think I died and went to sugar coma heaven) .  So moral of this story is this.... Go to Wildfish Seafood and Grille, make sure Charles is your server, order the oysters (if your into that kind of thing!) and get the Chilean Sea Bass and don't skip desert!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here. We had reservations for a group of us and was able to get seated right away.   The tables are quite close to each other. However the servers and wait staff were great! Very friendly.   Now.. For the food... The menu is slim pickings, seemed like there were more appetizers and sides than main entrees and dishes. This made it a little difficult for me to decide on a main course, but I went with the 22 ounce ribeye steak and ordered half dozen oysters to start.  Because the steak is \"a la cart\" I had to get sides separately. For my side I ordered sauté spinach.   The steak was pricy however, it lacked spice and was not as tasty as other nice places. The spinach was on point and delicious.  Now the oysters were absolutely amazing! It was big, meaty, and had no odor or fish like smell! It was so fresh!   We also shared the Steak and Lobster Tar Tar and the Yellowtail Sashimi. The Sashimi was great! The tar tar was ok. The Tartare Of Pacific Ahi Tuna probably would have been a better choice. Well maybe next time.   All in all it was a good experience. Good dining."}
{"text":"I went the Wildfish Seafood Grill for a Scottsdale Chamber of Commerce Event. I was blown away how good the food and service was.  I will certainly go back !!!"}
{"text":"Very nice place for dinner. The perfect margarita was definitely perfect! And the lemon sole was delicious. We got a side (small) of the Brussel sprouts which were excellent and the swordfish with crab was perfectly light but filling."}
{"text":"I love this place. It isn't too hard to get into on a Friday night, but the food is among the best in old Scottsdale. One great way to tell is their Heirloom Tomato salad.  Even the best restaurants have a tough time using flavorful ripe tomatoes, but I have had the dust each of the last two times I visited and the they were spectacular.  The oysters always taste fresh which is another tough test to consistently pass. The sea bass honk Kong style was incredible.  Go to this restaurant before it gets too busy to  to make plans at the last minute.  It should be a lot busier that it is!!!"}
{"text":"I had the most amazing experience of my life here tonight. I cannot believe a seafood place has the worlds most amazing steak. It was a filet Minot like nothing I've had in my life all over Canada and the states. You haven't lived until you've had the filet and lobster meal here. Start with an oyster or two and you will have the most amazing night of your life"}
{"text":"I wondered if this place was new having only one review - I was quite pleased I gave it a shot  last night.  came here with my colleague but this would be a great date spot.  classy. great service. I had the swordfish steak topped with crab. it was awesome. as was my colleague's Chilean sea bass. also had the chocolate lava cake with ice cream that was fairly amazing. (it should be, it was Nat'l Dessert Day! or so I was told.)  I ordered an old fashioned. I've had better. my colleague had the lobster bisque. she wiped the bowl clean with her bread - it was that good.  you should go here. with a date. and your wallet."}
{"text":"Every time I'm out in Phoenix, I HAVE to stop off at Wildfish Seafood Grille for dinner.  I had the Wildfish Chopped Salad with Crab and Shrimp and it was delicious.  I also ordered the small truffle mac and cheese and bacon shallot brussel sprouts and both were very good too.  Great service and great food!"}
{"text":"I liked Wild Fish, and I would go back.  However, it didn't rock my world.  Corporate bullshit, ya know.  I would never call the place trendy, it's in a strip mall and has little personality.  The service was not remarkable, the wait was too long.  But, in the end, my meal was quite good.  The fish was cooked perfectly and the portions were impressive.  Skip the dessert and go elsewhere.  A bit pricey but that shouldn't be a deterant."}
{"text":"Dude...a happy hour that is TRULY happy!!!    This joint is relatively swank for all the deals it has.  Nice decor, good bar, FRESH seafood (seriously...this is some good quality).  Starting at 4:00 p.m., they have $5 martinis AND $0.75 oysters.  YUM!  On top of that, they offer discounts on other appetizers such as the bread and cheese plate, a GIANT crab cake, a salads, and shrimp dishes.  All are tasty.  For all the Zoners out there (yeah, I said it), you have to check out this place.  You will have a great time!   NOTE - beware of dirty old men.  They'll hit on your friends!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a light dinner and drinks on a Thursday night.   Seated immediately and served some warm bread.  Drinks were great and didn't skimp on the alcohol.   We ordered a half dozen of the premium oysters and they were awesome.  Worth every penny.   The horseradish that came with them was really, really, really great.  Had to try the lobster bisque based on other reviews.   It was very good.  Not the best I've had, but very creamy and filling.      Service was top notch.   Manager even stopped by to see how things were and chat.  I would eat here again without hesitation."}
{"text":"4 guys hanging out for Tuesday Happy hour which to our great surprise was all night long!!! Service, food, prices, ambiance, and overall restaurant experience was fantastic!!! Would definately be back!!!"}
{"text":"I have visited this establishment numerous times, along with friends or family.  And NEVER have I ever had a bad experience!  From entering to exiting, and everything in between, has always been fabulous and extremely customer-service oriented!  A friend took me for my birthday (her first visit), and  Eric and Pat made it a birthday for my black velvet box of great memories!  They both made me feel like I was the Queen and a Princess.  The drinks were superb, the food was out-of-this-world, with the best service to boot!    After eating appetizers, salad, and the main dish which was their delectable crabcake I was so full!  When I felt the best exit would be to roll, not walk out of there, they bring me the best dessert, banana foster,  with candle and song!  Just the right touch to top off an already memorable evening!    Wildfish is great!  And Eric and Pat is GREATER!!!"}
{"text":"Yes, five stars!  First review and I thought I'd make it a good one.    From start to finish a fantastic experience.  The fish is *so* fresh and perfectly prepared.  My friend had a bone in filet - best steak we've ever had.  Just done to perfection.    The ambiance is nice - definitely upscale and vibrant.  And once it cools down a bit, I cannot wait for the patio to get going.    Great job Wildfish, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A very solid sea food restaurant, classed up in the dark classy Scottsdale ambiance that you'd expect.   Prices are high (it's a sea food restaurant), but the food is worth it.  Wildfish is a place I've wanted to try for quite a while, and thanks to an excellent Restaurant Week menu, I finally did.  We had the spicy tuna roll.  With avocado, cucumber, and cilantro, it came together quite nicely.  It's not something that would take me away from a regular sushi bar, but certainly a perfect appetizer.  Asian barbecue steelhead trout.  The fish was cooked perfectly.  I enjoyed the sauce.  It had a great kick, but it tasted much more american barbecue than asian.  We also went off the restaurant week menu and had lemon sole.  This was one nice fish.  We finished the restaurant week selection with vanilla bean creme brûlée.  This is was an unfortunate miss.  It was hot.  Creme brûlée is supposed to be made in advanced, cooled off, then the top is torched.  This was warm all the way through.  The peanut butter cookie that came with it was tasty, but did not compliment the dish any further.  Not at all what I was hoping for.  Other than the disappointing dessert, it was an all around great dining experience.  The service is wonderful.  The staff is very friendly, and plates were cleared and drinks were refilled very quickly.  I should also mention that the bread we received before the appetizer was straight out of the oven, hot!  The cold butter melted right on it."}
{"text":"Just finished dinner at Wildfish. We were going to go to Citizen Public House but that required a 30 minute wait for a table or sitting at the bar. Which would have been okay if the restaurant wasn't so noisy. Wildfish was our backup and we were very happy to end up there. Tuna tartar appetizer was excellent, followed by halibut in a lemon butter sauce. The fish was perfectly prepared, moist and flakey. We splurged on the twice baked potato, which was excellent as well. We enjoyed it so much we made reservations for Friday. Best fish and meal we've had in Scottsdale so far. Service was very excellent."}
{"text":"Delicious food with excellent service. We came here with a group of 13 girls with reservations, were seated promptly, and they took our orders for apps to share.   By the time we got our drinks, the apps also came out. We shared the dumplings, calamari, and truffle mac and cheese. The calamari was a bit on the salty side because of the sauce that covered it.   I had the Chilean sea bass as my entree and it was delicious. The price was steep at $45 but the fish melted in my mouth! One of the best Chilean sea bass dishes I've ever had."}
{"text":"We used to love this place, but the staff seemed to have turned over recently as the service was very very slow. Food was also just so/so. Lobster came out raw. May rethink coming back after 5+ years of this being our favorite spot."}
{"text":"Was on a break at work at 3pm two days ago considering Wildfish for happy hour, so I called first to see if I could speak w/ a kitchen manager or chef re food allergies and soon was speaking to sous chef Matt.  Since I've had happy hour (1/2 off select apps) there before- I've not had the pleasure of having dinner, yet- I already knew I loved the All Lump Crabcake (reg. $14.95) and the Crispy Cashew Calamari ($12.95?).  Knowing that many Asian recipes use * I asked Matt if the calamari salad contained any (I recalled that the salad had * as a garnish) - the answer was yes.  That left me w/ the crabcake.  Did Wildfish use ** in preparation?  No on the *, but yes on the * (the remoulade that came w/ the crabcake also contained *), but if I were to call in the morning and let them know I was going to have dinner there, he'd be able to make a batch of *-free crabcake and remoulade.  I lamented that I was actually going to head over there at 4p, but... Immediately, Matt said he'd have a special batch ready for me, no problem (!!).  I also spotted Maine lobster bisque on the online menu and had asked Matt if roux or * was used as a thickener (if *, then I couldn't have it), but, like most quality restaurants, Wildfish uses only roux.  Upon hearing this tidbit, I was excited and looking forward to having a bowl of bisque, the crabcake app, and a glass of cabernet!  As soon as I walked into the restaurant, I was warmly accosted by the host, who informed me that I could sit anywhere I wanted.  I asked her if I could speak with Matt and was told he'd be informed I was there.  While I waited, I perused through the menu and found that BV Signet chardonnay, merlot, and cab sauvignon were the select wines selling for $5 a glass during happy hour, so I chose the cab.  I also ordered a bowl of the lobster bisque.  A few minutes passed by, my delicious cab arrived (I love the wine glasses there!), and soon I was speaking to Matt in person, who must have spent at least 20 minutes w/ me (in addition to the time he spent on the phone w/ me earlier) throughout my time there looking over the menu and seeing which items I could try and which were off-limits.  It's so refreshing to know that there are restaurants who have staff who are willing to take the time to listen to their customers and be willing to tweak their recipes so that people w/ food issues may still enjoy many menu options.  I was happy to learn that afternoon, that most, if not all, the seafood dishes could be adjusted, either by leaving off one or more ingredients, or by substituting a different sauce (which many restaurants are unwilling to do, it seems- something to do w/ quality control) or vegetable side.  The topic of desserts came up soon enough, so for those with corn allergies, you'll be happy to know that the Cinnamon-raisin bread pudding and Hot chocolate Godiva cake, as well as the Hot apple & cinnamon cobbler (minus the ice cream- it contains corn syrup) and Creme brulee (minus the cookies- they contain baking powder, but don't worry, he'll substitute fresh berries, instead!) are SAFE TO ENJOY.  I of course adored the special crabcake Matt prepared for me- I confess I was so smitten by it, that I had TWO crabcake dishes (Matt was gracious enough to whip up another batch for me!) along w/ the table bread and butter.  I must mention that as I was sipping a few tablespoonsfuls of the bisque, Matt stopped by to let me know that it contained a couple of ingredients I mentioned needing to avoid, so he promptly took the soup out of my sight.  No worries, though, as this left me more room for that second crabcake!  (Sadly, I did exhibit allergy symptoms all day Wednesday...)  (Hope you enjoy the photos.  Love that ice mountain adorned with shellfish!  FYI, fresh-shucked oysters are 50c during happy hour!!)"}
{"text":"This is a clear five star experience.  We just got off of a 10 cruise.  Where food is everything.  This place was so good. I had the sword fish. It was the best fish I have had ever.  The service was excellent.  The banana foster was the best imaginable. My wife had a chicken dish, she commented full of flavor.   This is far better than other restaurant in this location. The portion was adequate serving."}
{"text":"Don't you love it when you walk into a place, and the bar is situated so everyone can't help but notice the sudden burst of daylight, eclipsed by the shadowy figure that is you? The door closes behind you, they're still looking.  What are they looking at you wonder. Didn't they have moms who taught them it wasn't polite to stare? Yet they do, and now you're uncomfortable.  Mom always said the only reason people stare is if you're really attractive or really repulsive.  Thanks mom...like that helps right now.   You take a seat at the bar, order your drink, and begin to look around while settling in.  And this is the point where you realize how you've just entered some sort of twilight zone where only beautiful people exist.  Even the old people are beautiful.   Two stars for the hostess not turning me away.  This isn't the place for torn 501's, black Chuck Taylor's, and a t-shirt with 96 bold font reading  \"Excuse me...you're standing on my penis.\"  This is the place where people look as though they've just fallen out of a page from Marie Claire, or Esquire.  Not Guns and Ammo.  May I suggest the one-dollar oysters and several beers with which to wash the slimy shites down? I know, you hate oysters...right?  Me too.   The oysters are necessary however in this situation, as they demonstrate your culinary prowess, negating your lack of fashion, raising you up a few pegs...going from classless mook to eccentric cool guy. And all for a buck each, go figure.  The many, many beers provide goggles. Also needed to help gravitate your fellow pub-goers down a few pegs...to your level. At least in your mind anyway.  Once the playing field is level, now you can strike up a conversation with Miss Thing who's seated next to you. I hope she can read my shirt."}
{"text":"Oysters are to die for! We got half a dozen and loved them so much, we got another! Also, their yellowtail is so good! Their wine list is so large and has my favorite on there. I cannot wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Food = 5 Service = 0  I was in town with a group of friends last weekend.  We walked in an checked in under our reservation.  We were told that they were getting the table ready and it would be just a few minutes...and then they forgot about us.  When we glanced outside, we could see our table, all ready and waiting for us - such a tease!  We we re-checked-in with the SAME hostess, she gave me a blank look and asked if I had checked in - painful!  Once we were seated, we had to hunt down wait staff to take our orders.  Then we waited for our food...and waited...and waited.  THANKFULLY, one of my friends caught wind of some commotion next to our table when they had brought our our entrees.  Apparently, they forgot to bring out our salads so they were going to bring our entrees back to the kitchen (presumable to sit under heat lamps) so that we could have our salads.  She stepped in and let them know that we would be a-ok without the salads.  To be fair they offered us ONE free dessert.  Once we had our food, it was all incredible.  I tried bites of everyone's dinners and the sea bass, scallops, and butterfish were remarkably wonderful.  We also enjoyed our complimentary bread pudding for dessert."}
{"text":"OMG. This place is fantastic. The fish is so fresh and well prepared. Service is amazing and the drinks are perfectly made. If you are looking for a great fish restaurant you can't lose with Wildfish."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant ever!  And I actually mean my absolute #1 favorite!  Great Happy Hour!  Be careful though, it is a Cougar Den..."}
{"text":"If I could eat seafood every day for the rest of my life I would die happy, so I am always looking for new seafood places to try.    Being a landlocked desert state known for their Mexican food it is hard to find a seafood place that I am able to find the courage to try.  The crab cakes were outstanding and the ambience just added to the experience.  I had the Ahi tuna which was good and my girlfriend had the swordfish which was great!    The place is in a hip area of Scottsdale and the only negative part of the evening was when the Manager came up to greet us at our table I found out it was my girlfriend's ex boyfriend.  Probably wont go on any more dates there but definitely want to go back and try happy hour...maybe with my brother."}
{"text":"The only thing I would come back to this place is on Sunday, for their happy hour (all day) for some raw oysters, a bit of Fuji apple salad (just to have some greens for the day), and perhaps the crab cake if bf is tagging along.  Please don't get their calamari. It's the worst calamari I've had in my life, flavor-less, breading coat was too thick, and seriously, you can't mix everything with ginger sauce and call it Asian fusion. The fish dishes were alright, but honestly I've had better.  Service wasn't that attentive either, and it wasn't a very crowded night."}
{"text":"Five stars, all the way. Five star staff... our server was incredibly attentive and accomodating, which is wonderful when you make the fantastically inappropriate decision to dine at a seafood restaurant with a vegetarian and a person who hates fish. She made sure we were not just happy, but ecstatic with our wine choices by bringing over various tastes from their lengthy wines by the glass list.   They graciously serve oysters (two different kinds) in any denomination, so if you're craving 'em but don't want to order a bunch (or if you really want someone to try them... and you should, the blue tips were A-MAZ-ING), you don't have to... you can just get one.  The cashew calamari was impressively tender, and no having to deal with the little baby squid guys with their tentacles and so on. It's all fresh and fileted length-wise, then battered and fried. Delish.  The servers all wear white jackets (it's an appreciated touch) and mill about quickly and efficiently. The place is so large that you sometimes forget that the other side of the wine cellar boasts a rather bustling bar. The chairs are wonderfully comfortable. The lights are high, like the designers were exalting the space and celebrating the high ceilings. The experiential fountain pillars out front are disarming, as are the textured French doors. The whale bone-esque structure over the bar is a clever design element, feeding the eastern thought that restaurants are, indeed, where you enter the belly so as to feed the belly.  I will be back here again and again."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for Happy Hour after a shopping trip to Nordstrom , what a fun Happy Hour and the dishes were wonderful! we had the lobster and steak tartare and the chilled shrimp cocktail. Both of these appetizers were so yummy! The ambiance is dark and sexy, the back bar has a large ice display with lobster and King crab legs displayed . The bar was absolutely packed! We will definitely be back to try out this spot for dinner."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the most wonderful seafood! We all loved everything we ordered. The service was great! Andrew made us feel so comfortable and Chef Michelle was wonderful at making sure we loved our food. It was a memorable evening."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Wildfish since it opened and after my most recent Saturday evening dining experience, I must say, the quality of both the food and service have gone way downhill.   I know....a busy Saturday night and so, perhaps I should give both the servers and chef a break? Sorry. The menu has changed and so has the quality of food - and not in a good way. Let me just give you a brief sample of our experience - the Ahi Tuna Tartare appetizer has been changed to a lackluster combination of flavors. The idea of tuna with mango seems lovely however there is a total and complete blandness to the way this dish is now served. The former tuna appetizer was far more tempting. Moving onto the Goat Cheese Medallion Arugula salad. My salad was served sans medallion and literally laden with a huge glob of cold goat cheese and some terribly prepared mushrooms. What happened to the warm, crusted goat cheese? Next, we both ordered the Parmesan Crusted Sole. While the sole was prepared well, I do not recall this dish having a cream based sauce in the past. If memory serves me well, the dish should have had a lemon sauce delicately balancing the flavor of the fish. Cream and sole do not make a happy pair!  I am not sure if this was an error or part of the new menu. Okay, and for the piece de resistance we ordered a side of the Sugar Snap Peas which were actually drowning in a bath of some kind of soy and oil sauce. It actually made me ill to eat it - and my companion, as well.   Our service was slow and unattentive - although I do realize service can be a very personal experience.   I was sick with food poisoning all day Sunday - as if the poorly prepared food were not enough to bring down my joy.   So, I caution those of you who may have once enjoyed this restaurant like me - think twice before dropping a pretty penny at Wildfish."}
{"text":"2.5, just not enough to give it three.   Food was just OK and they ran out of ahi tuna by 9pm!   They have happy hour all night (pretty good specials too) but they close SO early (10pm last call on Sunday)!"}
{"text":"Great service but the food left me desiring a meal elsewhere. My husband and I really enjoyed the bar staff as well as our server once we sat down for dinner. The people were fantastic but the food wasn't good at all. We started with a crabcake at the bar. It fell apart easily and lacked flavor. Once seated for dinner, I ordered scallops and my husband had grouper. We also shared a side of the truffle mac and cheese. My entree came with 5 scallops and was paired with citrus flavors. I ate a scallop and a half, and just couldn't do it anymore. The scallops weren't caramelized and they tasted like water. I understand what they were going for with the citrus, but it wasn't executed properly. Worst scallops I've ever had.. My husbands grouper was exceptionally small and very over salted. The lemon sauce it was paired with also had a water taste. The grouper was extremely dry.   On a positive note, the bread was good.. :)  I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. Good service from waitstaff can only get you"}
{"text":"Great decor, food, drinks and staff.  We started our dinner with oysters (all very good) and Crispy Salt and Pepper Shrimp (with Ginger, Red Chiles and Sugar Snap Peas) - so good!  I can't remember what exactly we ordered, but it was all really good. My fiance & I had two different kinds of salads while his sister & her fiance had some kind of fish (also very good). The portions are bigger than what I had expected. I do remember ordering the Parmesan and Chives French Fries which I recommend ordering."}
{"text":"Sadly, my experience at Wildfish this evening was extremely disappointing, due in large part to the total ineptitude of our waiter. He was well meaning and very pleasant (apologizing each time he messed up) but his lack of training was appalling. To specify: (1) he forgot to bring the wine we ordered, (2) forgot to order one of our side dishes so that it came a full ten minutes after our meal was served, and then (3), left the dirty dishes in front of us even while pouring our coffee. The food was fine, which is the only reason this received 2 stars rather than 1.  But it could not compensate for such bad service. It certainly wasn't worth the cost of this dinner."}
{"text":"This place rocks.   I've done happy hour here a few times and the atmosphere, quality of service and food is great.  Just recently we celebrated a birthday here on a Wednesday evening  and again the experience didn't disappoint.   Service was top notch and the food was remarkable.  Being a Wednesday night and during a monsoon storm didn't do wonders for the business that night but maybe it helped with the service.  Reviews abound for this place, so I'll just stick with our specifics.   Our party of 3 started with 9 gulf oysters and a crab cake, chased down with a top-shelf cosmo, glass of wine, and a mojito. The mojito was deceptively strong as it should be and the crab cake was easily top ten - the remoulade with it was very tasty.  Oysters were fresh shucked with horseradish and cocktail.  For the mains - Australian lobster tails, scallops, and sea bass. Absolutely amazing - every dish looked, smelled, and tasted perfect.  The lobster tails were the star of this show - that's what the birthday girl ordered. The server said Australian tails are typically sweeter than Maines, albeit a little smaller, and he wasn't lying - they were oh so sweet and succulent.  The sea bass is steamed in an oriental fashion and the scallops were cooked to medium with herbs and a light buttery sauce. The bass flaked delicately and the scallops easily cut with a fork - both dishes melted in your mouth.  We also split 2 small sides - brussel sprouts and asparagus. The brussels were very tasty as they are cooked with bacon and shallots but I thought the asparagus was a bit over salted - perhaps that's why they serve it with a delicious hollandaise sauce on the side.    Dessert consisted of a typical chocolate lava cake served birthday style and on the house.  Things to consider:  The restaurant is quite dim - by design. The servers carry little flashlights in case you need help reading.  Parking at this location pretty much sucks.  They do valet, but if you're self-parking chances are you will be walking. For everything mentioned in the review(3 rounds of drinks) - $300+ otd.  To sum it up, Wildfish delivers on all fronts - ambiance, service, menu, plating, and taste.  But we all already knew that, right? :-)"}
{"text":"Oysters wasn't fresh, but kungpao calamari and the cooked oyster( I forgot the name) is soooooo delicious! The entrees was good I had the hong kong style sea bass it was fresh and tasty and the server is really friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent food,  large variety and great service.   Lobster broiled and.sweetened to perfection.   The molten choc filled cake was an awesome end to dinner.  Expensive,  but to be expected for having great seafood in middle of desert. There were two waiters for my family of 4 and the service was impeccable.    Very expensive, but if you want to eat something special, be treated special, and for special occasions, this is the place."}
{"text":"I have been to Wildfish on a number of occasions and have always left with a smile on my face.  The food is to die for.  We always sit in the bar and take advantage of their happy hour specials. Happy hour is 7 days a week, Sun-Thursday from 4pm to close and Friday and Saturday 4-7. They have several cocktails avaiable for $6 (including cosmos, bacardi mojitios, el jimador magaritas, etc.) If those don't strike your fancy you also receive $2 off any of their specialty cocktails. There is also a special on wine, but I dont drink wine so I'm not sure what the discount is.  There are several appetizers available for $1O and other \"small plates\" available at discounted prices. And you don't have to sit at the bar itself, there are several booths available as well as two long tables that would sit at least 8 probably 10 people so great for am after work spot with your co-workers.                                                                                       Last night by husband and I arrived right as they opened at 4 pm.  We sat down at the bar top and were immediately greeted by a friendly, young gent named Eric.  While we always have a great exerience at Wildfish, this visit was the by far the best solely due to Erics excetional service.  He was very accomadating and made is feel at home. The man also makes an amazing Manhattan and a sectacular Cucumber Martini.  Anywho, we ordered a dozen oysters ($2 each) and their kung pao calamari to start. Oysters were juicy and delicous and the calamari was a heaping portion of calamari tossed with veggies and toasted cashews in a delectable kung pao sauce over a bed of crispy rice noodles.                                                                                                    Next round, we ordered the piece de resistance.  Their Crabcake.  It is the reason we make the trek from Glendale at least once a month. Light, fluffy and full of big ole' pieces of delectable crab meat.  It's served with a side of remolade and is big enough to share as an appetizer or order for a meal.  It is truly the best crab cake I have ever had.  We always order it with a side of their truffled mac and cheese.  Weird combo I know, but it works!                                                              While we do not usually order dessert I can tell you that everything on that menu is made in their pastry kitchen daily.  Two that stuck out where the \"bananas foster\" butter cake and the Godiva chocolate cake, both baked to order. They also do espresso and lattes."}
{"text":"Man I wish I could give 4.5 stars!   Food was 5/5 stars for sure. Everything was fresh and my Dad said his salmon was some of the best he has ever had (and boy has this man consumed a lot of salmon in his lifetime).  I had the seafood salad which I was amazing. I was surprised with how much seafood was actually included--very large pieces of fresh crab and huge shrimp. Good sized portions as well.  Our server took good care of us. The decor is upscale and comfortable. There is outdoor seating but if you don't request it with your reservation you aren't going to get it on a busy night. My only complaint was how loud it was during our dinner mostly from the music. Our party definitely had to speak up to be heard. I have had this same complaint at more than one restaurant in Scottsdale so I am beginning to think this is common in the more trendy areas of town.  Would go back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"So I've eaten at this restaurant before. However, the other night we had a guest in from out of town and an event earlier in the evening. So we booked a reservation at this restaurant, WHICH THEY CONFIRMED.  When we walked into the restruant the place wasn't very busy and the greeter informed us that our reservation wasn't going to be honored, but, we were welcome to order a drink at the bar.  Because it was already after 9 at that point we had a difficult time finding a place that could accommodate us on such short notice.   Interestingly we didn't even have the latest reserved seating they were offering, there was one or two even later.   I eat out and entertain a lot for business and personal.  I rarely write totally negative reviews. But, Not honoring a reservation that a restaurant has not only taken but, have CONFIRMED just because the staff is lazy and wants to go home is completely unacceptable and shows a general lack of customer service and care for the client.  I do agree with an earlier reviewer.. If you want seafood go to mccormicks and schmicks or for a more local flare, The Salt Cellar."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time when I took my family visiting from KS here for my ASU graduation.  I thought the seafood was pretty good but there is definitely a few better places in the valley.  My family was really impressed with it though. I'm not sure if its because seafood restaurants are scarce in KS or if they really just loved it that much. I liked the dim lighting but the tables were really close together.  We had to wait awkwardly for a few minutes when we were trying to leave because we were blocked in by the trays of another table's food being delivered. Also I'm not sure where our server was from but his accent was really thick and it was really difficult to understand anything he said. Made it a little difficult to find out the specials. Overall I did enjoy it tho. I'd love to come back and try their happy hour. I hear its pretty good"}
{"text":"This place has a great Happy Hour!! 4-7 each day and 4- close on Sunday and Mondays!!! The food is great and the bar is lively during HH. It's hard to go wrong here with anything..."}
{"text":"Had drinks and apps here while waiting for a table next door. It was my first time here and we saddled up to the bar for about an hour or so. I tried two drinks (side car and red dragon?) which were not my go-to drinks but I did enjoy them. For apps we shared the Point Judith calamari and a noodle dish with tuna (can't find it on the menu now). The calamari was probably the best I have ever tried - very spicy (I love spicy) and fresh tasting. I also enjoyed the noodle dish, though I wish it had been as hot as the plate it was served on. Although I'm not a huge seafood person, their menu is attractive enough that I would stop in again."}
{"text":"The food and service were excellent. I would recommend a reservation on the weekends as the place had a 2 hour wait when I was there on a Saturday night. Our waiter was knowledgeable and enthusiastic.    The swordfish, mac & cheese, wine list, were all top notch. I was not too crazy about the green beans though."}
{"text":"It been a couple years since we've been back. Back again though for another Birthday celebration. We made reservations on Opentable for a Wednesday at 7:00 for a party of 3. We were greeted and seated right away. Our server for the evening introduced himself promptly, Everett.  We ordered drinks while perusing the menu. We had started off with Blue Point Oysters, Steak and Lobster Tartare. For entrees we had the Parmesan Lemon Sole, Pacific Ahi Tuna Tempura and the Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes. We ended the evening with a complimentary Birthday Creme Brulee. The food and service were excellent. A Birthday celebration well enjoyed."}
{"text":"Great place for seafood and fish lovers.  The crab cakes are to die for!The restaurant is beautiful and although it is quite a big place we did not find it too noisy."}
{"text":"Went Saturday night for Restaurant Week $44 menu again it was really good. The lobster and shrimp bisque was nice with a lovely warm bread and flavored butter. I had one glass of  chenin Blanc for $10. Florida grouper with lemon sauce and asparagus was unique because we don't get nice fresh fish like this to cook ourselves. Hubby enjoyed his well cooked filet and the brussel sprouts were delish with the bacon and shallots. Highlight is the Banana Foster flambe dessert with butter pecan ice cream so yummy carmely! Easy to park for free underneath and we had very good service."}
{"text":"I do not understand all of the good reviews of this restaurant. For the money it is really not good at all. The calamari dish was pretty tasteless. It is supposed to be spicy and have a lot of nuts and it was just a bunch of fried calamari on some noodles. I paid extra for sea bass with crab meat. It was so Bland you could have fed it to a two year old. My husband's dish was so salty he sent it back. Oh and get this the french fries were lousy. Can you imagine? They are better at almost  any fast food joint in the Valley. We had a decent bottle of wine and I can't complain about the service but really I would never go back and I would never suggest to anybody that they waste their money on this place."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I made reservations on their website and specified that my wife and I were celebrating our anniversary. Our table had rose petals on it and an anniversary card that was signed by the staff. Peter was our server and was awesome. He was very proper yet normal and down to earth, which is good since we aren't Scottsdale folk. We started with a bottle of wine, a half dozen oysters, and the crab cake. The oysters were by far the best I've ever had. My wife has always been intrigued by oysters but too scared to try them since the consistency looks like mucus. Peter helped me talk her in to trying one and lo and behold she immediately loved them. The crab cake was also incredible as it was about 98% crab with some seasoning sprinkled on top, rather than half crab and half some other stuff. We ordered a bowl of the Lobster Bisque for the second course and it was awesome. My wife chose the sole for her main dish and I chose the scallops. The sides are all served a la carte, so we chose the broccolini, spinach, and au gratin potatoes. The scallops were the best I've ever had and my wife loved the sole. Lastly, we were given a complimentary dessert of our choice for our anniversary, so we chose the bananas foster. Incredible. It was flambéed at our table which cartelized the outside of the butter cake, making the outside a little crisp but also chewy like candy. It was so good. Everything was incredible and the service was amazing. I highly recommend this place for special occasions. Thanks Peter and all the rest of the Wildfish staff."}
{"text":"Wonderful Happy Hour, as most of their appetizers and drinks are half off.  They have the best crab fried in the nation!  Ambience is hip and young, with many of the local Scottsdale people in for their meal, as well as visitors to the area. Décor is modern Asian, with a twist of contemporary.  Nice open space, good for large groups, but expect long wait times"}
{"text":"I have not been overly impressed with Wildfish either time I have been there. It is incredibly spendy and the atmosphere/food don't really justify the prices.  Happy hour is decent, but good luck fighting the grey hairs for a spot at the bar.   Last week I had a major craving for raw oysters, went to WF for happy hour where the oysters are only .75 a piece. Jesse the bartender is rad, but he shamefully explained they were out of oysters. WTF!!!!!!! I drove all the way from central Phoenix during rush hour to slurp down a dozen. How could they be out of all oysters at 5pm on a Monday!  I'll probably go back because when they have them they are out of this world. Next time I'll have to call ahead to make sure they put a dozen aside for me."}
{"text":"I just had to give this place the 5 stars....because I love that Chilean sea bass!!!!! Like I would go to bed with that bass and day dream all day!  So yummy and quite delicious and just hot off the press. It really looked beautiful in white and sitting atop some spinach and then settled in like an island in a puddle of light soy sauce broth - Hong Kong style.  The last time I had it in this version was meh.  So this days chef was on point.  I haven't had a really good Chilean sea bass in awhile. So when I do have one, you guys need to know what I'm talking about. It is listed as MKT price FYI.  I was able to slice the sea bass with my knife in one motion and each cut came out Mr. Clean!   I did utilize a pair of chopsticks ...I mean why not.  A delicate fish handled well. Everything was gone on that plate except for the ginger pieces.   The competitor: the Alaskan sable fish. This one was just as fantastic..more firm with a nice miso glaze. Shitake mushrooms and snap peas meddled into the affair - sweet and savory together.   Well not to discount the other things I had, but the Judith Point calamari was I guess also on point! Ha! Kung pao style made it a bit spicy for me, but I'm weak sauce. But great texture and not chewy at all!   A half dozen mix of west coast oysters will have you cry at $4 a piece. But what can I say - it's brine time. Still yummy!  And last but not least, butterscotch Panama cotta. I was wanting something chocolate-y, but I opted for something out of the ordinary. It came with biscotti, which made it look pretty but I found it to be unnecessary and not as complementing to the dessert. Maybe because it was in the \"stale\" stage. But the creaminess of the dessert and the caramel mounted on top did its job. I continued to eat most of it....as usual! Sigh!   Well, until then I'll just dream. But you should def try their fish options!"}
{"text":"When I dine out, the experience we had last night at Wild fish, is exactly what I hope for. Lovely space, efficient and friendly service (thanks Nico!), amazing drinks and food. The oysters were fresh and delicious and the lobster bisque was the best I've ever had. Looking forward to many return visits."}
{"text":"Met friends for dinner there tonight.  I had the lump crab appetizer which was okay followed by the Ceasar salad. My friend requested no croutons and extra anchovies and we both got a slab of lettuce with no croutons and no anchovies. When i asked the waiter for the anchovies he asked what kind we wanted. Really? How many different types are there? Anyway, i ordered the scallops for the main course and without a doubt the worse scallops I've ever had.  Chalky, milky texture with no sear and a slice of grapefruit on top with an over-powering citrus taste. Couldn't eat them.  This place is pretentious and overpriced with subpar food. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Seafood in AZ?  Isn't that like Chicago style pizza in Hawaii?  No. We hit this place up on the 4th of July, while all the other touristos were down getting blitzed in Tempe, and it was amazing. They had great specials, good oysters rockefeller, good steaks, and we all left totally stuffed.   If you are looking for a decent seafood spot (that isn't sushi) give this joint a whirl."}
{"text":"Very classy ambience. They have a huge wine collection. You can tell by looking at the wine shelf. The staffs here are friendly. Even the on-training waiter looks very professional.  Everything under oyster bar section in the menu is a must try. Chilean sea bass is quite unique. I also had 2 lobster tails, and they are huge. They're a bit pricey tho ($88), and the second piece wasn't hot anymore after I finished the first one (I eat faster than most people). But they are delicious, 5 stars."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place.  I'm a regular here and go for thir excellent food and happy hour.  Lobster bisque for $6 and drinks or $5.   Service is excellent.  This place rocks!"}
{"text":"Let's get the nitty gritty out of the way.  Are they expensive? Yes. Will you leave full? Depends.  Is it worth it? Not for most.   With that said,  the ambience of this place was awesome.  Definitely a place that will impress anyone.  A bit on the pricey side.  Quality of the food is superb but i wouldnt say it's completely worth it because of the portion size.  Would have been nice to have some carbs to go with my swordfish.  I'd even settle for some veggies. They do give you free bread and butter upon sitting though.   We started the night off with some west coast oysters and jumbo lump crab cakes.  They do offer a variety of oysters which was nice but for the money,  I can't see why one couldn't settle for some nice blue points for a fraction of the cost.  We decided to try the totten and although they were delicious, at $24 for 1/2 dozen oyster, too expensive for my taste.   Crab cake was delicious and definitely worth a try if not anything else.   Portion size was enough for the two of us to share.   For dinner,  I ordered the swordfish and my fiance the Mediterranean branzino.  Both came out amazing but as stated above,  seemed like it was missing something.  A smidge of wild rice or veggies maybe? A few carrots? Something! Portion size aside,  the food was fresh and tasted great,  just pricey.   We both enjoyed some nice spirits during dinner. I ordered the Tokyo gimlet and she had the boozy Vietnamese coffee.  My drink was very refreshing with a slice of cucumber in the drink and well balanced with the alcohol while hers, although very uniquely done with coffee ice cubes, leaves more of a bitter taste on the tongue.  A little bit sweeter would have made that drink perfect. Maybe add some condense milk like the real vietnamese coffee?  Overall,  great place to try if you're nearby looking for a more upscale dinner.  Somewhere to splurge for a special occasion.  If price is the issue,  culinary dropouts is located next door as well"}
{"text":"Great service and fantastic food!  They do not stiff on portions here.  My hubby and I had the calamari appetizer, FUJI apple salad, small side of brussel sprouts, crab fried rice, main dishes were Chilean sea bass and the sole dish.  To compliment the meal we also had a bottle of Proseccco and the bananas foster for desert.  Better believe we packed it to go and will savor the rest later.  EXCELLENT!!!"}
{"text":"This is a lovely but pricey restaurant.  I came here about a week ago for the first time for a family dinner and they offered a 3 course fixed price menu for $25, which is a very good deal (considering if you ordered from the regular menu, one entree can cost you $25).    I started off with the salad with apples and walnuts.  The apples were slide VERY thinly and laid out beautifully in a fan-like shape.  The salad was fresh and the walnut provided a nice crunch.  There were also some sort of dried fruit in there which was a sweet surprise.  I had the halibut for my entree, but I wasn't very hungry so I didn't touch much of it.  My mom had the Hong Kong style sea bass, which was MUCH better than my halibut.  Her sea bass had this silky texture, almost like tofu, and the light sauce provided just the right amount of flavoring for the fish.  We finished off splitting a creme brulee, which was probably one of the best I've ever tried.  I'm not a huge fan of the hard candied layer on the top, but what was underneath had this nice dense texture and was just the right amount of creaminess.  One dish that is the highlight of our meal was the crab fried rice.  It was SOOO delicious, even better than the awesome sea bass.  We all found ourselves continuously reaching for the fried rice despite the fact that none of us had finished our actual entrees.  We loved it so much that we decided to order another to take home, and it still tasted great the second day.  One complaint: I barely touched my halibut that night and asked the waiter to wrap it up for me.  My fish came with a bed of rice and sauce and a bit of veggies, but when I got home and took out the fish, it was JUST THE FISH.  I was very upset, because without the sauce and the rice, how am I supposed to enjoy the whole dish? The fish would taste very dry.  And also I had paid for the whole thing, he had no right to throw part of my dinner away! So make sure when you ask for something to go, double check with them that they actually wrapped the WHOLE THING up for you.  Long review short: Get the crab fried rice.  Make sure you get your whole dish to go."}
{"text":"Are you vegetarian?  Have vegan friends? Find yourself in constant turmoil? Do you need yet another reason to explain why you'll never be vegan?  Well, look no further. A side order of truffle mac and cheese ($9 sm / $13 lg) and a bananas foster butter cake dessert ($11) will shut them up forever.  Macaroni is baked nicely and covered in flavorful creamy cheese. Topped with shavings of truffles and cheesy flavored breadcrumbs. Great texture and bite. Not too salty or gooey.  The bananas foster holds no bars. Soft butter cake topped with large banana slices and caramel sauce and accompanied with a delicious scoop of butter pecan ice cream and dollop of whipped cream.   Once the dessert gets flambéed, the entire table silences and watches in awe as it metamorphoses into the best dessert EVER and everyone leans in to see the blue flame finally settle down and then flicker out. Then everyone digs in for a bite of hot-sticky-creamy-cake-banana-sauce-cream mess.  Side effects include euphoria, satisfaction, and bliss. If you find yourself with a sugar-high, guiltiness, or feelings of over-eating consult your doctor immediately."}
{"text":"Had a salad and wife had tuna poke and it was really good.  The poke wasn't anything like in Hawaii, but above average.  For dinner I had the Seared Ahi Tuna and was cooked perfectly and quite a huge thick piece, and my wife had the Chilean Sea bass which she said was delicious.  The chefs took over 20 minutes to get our salads out and so the waiter apologized and then comped us a dessert which was delicious.  The place was expensive but reasonable for the quality and amount of food you receive.  I will try the happy hour next time I am in town to see what the fuss is about.  Sounds fun."}
{"text":"Great food and the service was attentive. Super tasty meal. I had the oysters on the half shell, lobster bisque, and scallops. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I live in Maryland but loved this place, its a real gem. We went on a Saturday night, the place was buzzing but you notice from the first moment to the last that the service is top class, really top class. They didn't rush us and they made us feel really welcome. The wine list is excellent and our waiter, Raul was very knowledgeable. He knew the menu inside out and picked a terrific wine for the meal. This place is perfect for any date night or an occasion when you want to impress. Bets of all, they aren't that expensive. If that was here in the DC are it would be ridiculously priced. Brilliant."}
{"text":"Classy, sassy, with a dash of salt.  Wildfish is the place to be during happy hours.  Their appetizers are phenomenal and out of this world.  Fresh oysters, fried calamari and some wagyu beef.  Wag what!? Wagyu stupid - Wiki it!  Their selection of wine is always a delight and service is bolting fast.  I think it helps when they're all dressed like penguins; there's so many! - awwe so cute though :)  The ambience is so chill with a nice touch of a lounge.  Happy Hours all day Monday so push that \"case of the Mundays\" aside! - Enjoy"}
{"text":"Im usually a fan of the Fox Concepts restaurants but Wildfish really doesnt live up to their usually good service and accommodating nature.  My request to have a vegetarian plate prepared was flat out denied (not a problem at the other Fox restaurants that go out of their way to work with me!) and I was encouraged to \"eat the sides\".  As we were sitting outside finishing our meal they shut off the heaters-in the middle of winter!  I guess they were ready to have us leave even though they had delivered the other guests meals only about 15 minutes prior.  From what I understand the entrees my guests had were excellent but even they were astonished by how we were treated."}
{"text":"Very good restaurant! The service was first class from the moment we walked in the door to the moment we walked back out the door. The atmosphere was very nice as well. It was lit perfectly and the sound level was just right. Very neat neon lit signs around the bar just to add a bit of character to the place.The steak is, in my humble opinion, one of the best I've had in the Phoenix metro area next to my personal favorite, The Keg. Very expensive for my taste but well worth the dining experience if you don't mind spending a bit. To give a good idea, you will spend apx $200 (or more) for two people to dine. Again, very good service and steak."}
{"text":"I finally made it back to Wildfish for dinner. I would have given it a 5 star ratting if they hadn't taken my wine of the menu.... Yo! Person in charge of the wine, put Mark West back please!   Went to dinner a few weeks ago, looking for some good seafood that wouldn't put me in the poor house, we choose well. The wine was decently priced, the wedge salad I started with was great (anything with bacon is great), the crab cake my date had was very good as well. Then we had the Salmon and parm-crusted Sol for dinner. I thought both were excellent. My sol was the top dish of the evening for sure, probably best fish I have ever had out. Try it! We were too full to try desert but they all sounded good.   The service was very good; didn't linger too long and never had to seek him out. Two very enthusiastic thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Celebrating Thanksgiving and our anniversary tonight! What a delicious meal ,the bread stuffing,squash, turkey and all the trimmings.....so good! Service was outstanding everyone made sure we had what we needed.  Then the complementary bananas foster desert,  wow!! Thank you Wildfish for making our anniversary dinner extra special tonight. Great job by all."}
{"text":"Wildfish is fantastic...the service was excellent only surpassed by the quality of food. My wife and I love the scallops and their shrimp cocktail is a classic but fantastic! We made a reservation and they take the time to pass your name to team so you always addressed as \"Mr and Mrs XYZ\"...makes you feel special like a visiting political VIP or something! The place is beautiful and I highly recommend it! SO TASTY!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in town for Spring Training and he was craving seafood. After searching, this popped up and it's easy to see why.   The ambience was relaxing and just what we needed for our last night in Scottsdale. Service was impeccable. I believe we had a server named Kyle...(I could be mistaking). He guided us in the right direction of what to get and proportions. He was very friendly and kept us full on water & our delicious cocktails. The food is also so great, I'm not the biggest seafood fan but got the potstickers and scallops. Both amazing! Great dining experience."}
{"text":"What a great Happy Hour!  We stopped in at 5 on a Friday and it was jammed.  The hostesses were very gracious and gave us a nice table since the bar was jammed. The crowd was loud, stylish and very friendly.  We ordered four appetizers, all of which were excellent.  The two most noteworthy were the crab cake which was both huge and just incredibly delicious and an unbelievable steal at $6.00 and the chopped salad that was so big the waiter had to split it onto two plates.  Again, about $6.00. We had some ahi sashimi thing that was very nice and a shrimp cocktail that was the least impressive of the lot.    The drinks were excellent and the service was outstanding : professional, quick and very friendly.  Very nice selection of wines by the glass too.  We rolled out of there stuffed and very satisfied with the entire experience.  Can't wait to go back for dinner.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We started with drinks- it was Sunday so there was all day happy hour and discounted appetizers.  We had a Dragon Berry Mojitos and Citrus Mist Martinis.  AMAZING.  The martini ranks up there with some of the best drinks we have ever had.  Our waiter, Josh Porvin, did an excellent job keeping our drinks coming and the timing for the entire meal was great!  We ordered the crab and shrimp potsickers for an appetizer.  The sauce they were served in was excellent, and they were just very tasty.  For our main course we followed the advice of many yelpers before and ordered the stuffed jumbo shrimp.  These shrimp were some of the largest we had ever seen.  Each bite was so rich and delicious.  The bacon was crisp and goat cheese was creamy.  What else can you ask for?  In addition to the entree, which we shared, we ordered a side of the crab fried rice.  Talk about delicious.  Josh recommended it when we couldn't decide what side dish we wanted and he didn't steer us wrong.  Over all this was the best meal of our entire trip to Arizona.  The service was fantastic and food was flawless.  If you go to Wildfish ask for Josh Porvin- he'll hook you up!"}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner with friends at Wildfish. Had raw oysters to start.  They were fresh and hit the spot.  The meal of both shrimp and a filet okay.  Everything we had was cooked nicely and the food was fresh.  The atmosphere is nice.  Most impressive was our server, Nico. He was excellent.  He knew his stuff from top to bottom, was very accommodating which how each person wanted their particular order, and didn't miss one beat the entire evening.  I have to say, I received the best service from him this entire year from any restaurant from the east coast to the west coast this year.  The main reason for my review was the service."}
{"text":"Normally a great place for seafood. Most recent dining was very ordinary as it took 3 times for the cook to get one of our meals correct. And that included manager intervention twice."}
{"text":"This place is great! Every time I have been there it has been on the money! From appetizers to entrees to the wine list just really good. Everything I have had is excellent but my favorite is the Chilean Sea Bass. But had Sword Fish, Scallops, just go. Go treat your ladies fellas."}
{"text":"Sorry, Catch 35. You have been topped by Wildfish. Well, topped is actually quite mild. This was more along the lines of the first Packers-Cardinals game of the 2015 season.  The level of service at Wildfish literally decimated Catch 35 on all levels.  The server's product knowledge was excellent right down to even suggesting wine pairings with our meal. However, if you are planning to eat here on a budget, good luck with that. The dinner we had was $77 including an appetizer, salad, chicken breast, side (sides are a la carte) and dessert.  A steak alone is $52+.  Speaking of the chicken breast, many places normally serve it too dry and it has me grabbing my water FAST.  Not here.  This was the most succulent and tender chicken breast I have EVER eaten in my entire life.  Plus, you get two huge ones for the price. The sauteed beets were beyond divine.  The desserts were so good that I was looking for the pastry chef so I could shake his/her hand.  Wildfish has now become my reference standard to compare all other restaurants."}
{"text":"Kevin was an excellent waitperson, thanks Kevin! We just finished a hike up on one of the local mountains. After we came down we wanted to get some yummy food for our 20th Anniversary so we decided to give the Wildfish Seafood Grill a try. The Wagyu ribeye was excellent and so was the Australian white fish.... thanks Wildfish, that was a great dinner :-) thanks also for the yummy cheesecake for desert!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! I recommend the salmon. Delicious! Everything was wonderful! !! Their dining room was booked but they have bar area tables which are open seating."}
{"text":"Ate at Wildfish this evening.  My wife had a really nice salad.  I ordered the fried oysters (good) and the Asian BBQ Salmon (sauce hid the taste of salmon completely.  Service was very good.  Atmosphere was dark.  Overall overpriced."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for our anniversary and everything was amazing. Every server individually wished us a happy anniversary. The food was perfectly cooked and packed with flavor. The only down side was the price, but we were expecting it. Dinner for two with one alcoholic beverage each, plus an appetizer was $200, including tip."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Shockingly bad...this is in comparison of Eddie V's in kierland. Identical menu...identical happy hour menu...same company...but taste like a completely different kitchen...I was pretty shocked!! I actually did not know they were Eddie V's sister restaurant until I saw the menu!! Since we have eaten at Eddie v's maybe 40 times or so...0Started with red dragon drink and inflection cabinet, reasonable for the price. Then had 10 west coast oysters from Washington, called capital...biggest west coast oysters i have ever had!! Rich and creamy...amazing...then the food arrived and went down hill. The lamb lollipops were terrible compared to Eddie V's...you can tell same recipe but made horribly...then had salt and pepper shrimp...again resemble same recipe but not as tasty, not as crunchy, disappointing...then had lobster and crab wonton. I really have nothing good to say about the wonton...and finally had blacken fish tacos...at Eddie v's you are drooling after eating and then here, yuck...so realistically, drive the 15 minute to kierland to have one of the best seafood experiences ever!! Here I would never recommend my enemies to come..."}
{"text":"I attended a Yelp Elite event here and I was completely wowed by the seafood.  Having lived and spent time in various places on the water I have diminished expectations for seafood now that I live in the desert.    Fear not!  I will be back here on the oysters alone!  Much less the jumbo shrimp, fresh tuna and crab cakes.    The last time I was this impressed with crab cakes I could smell the Atlantic.  The last time I had such good oysters I could smell the Pacific."}
{"text":"This place looks unique and fun. Food was ok and service was slow.  Came in with a huge group and we all fitted so comfortably except everything was ...... Well let's say they don't know how to service big parties that's has a lot of guest.  food was cold, service on drinks was very very slow...."}
{"text":"I love this place for Happy Hour.  Amazing prices and Oyster's that are the best I have ever had in AZ!  I go super early with my hubby and have referred others there as well.  Great professional staff and love how open it is."}
{"text":"Great service. Food was a good quality.  The pot stickers were ok. I was a little disappointed."}
{"text":"First day here in Scottdale and I choose this place to eat at for lunch, and I am glad I did. I ordered the Lobster tacos and fried rice with crabmeat. It was sooooo good... I would definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! The food and service were great. I had the tempura ahi tuna and my husband had the jumbo Shrimp. Both were so delicious. For an anniversary dessert they gave us the creamed brûlée. Wow the best I've ever had. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was average, I ordered the sea bass and it was nothing extraordinary neither the scallops. Since there are so many choices around the area, at their price tag, we won't be going back."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and overall experience. Definately go for happy hour, 1/2 price menu, but that's about the only reason I go back now."}
{"text":"I just love this place.   Great atmosphere, great cocktails, and wonderful happy hour snacks. Very reasonable pricing too.  Been to happy hour here a few times -- I had dinner here for the first time recently and was blown away.  One of the best deals in Scottsdale (and close to all the action of old town)."}
{"text":"Came here for our anniversary dinner. We were seated in the cutest booth with rose petals in a shape of a heart on the table. Super sweet! The food was good, service was good but the restaurant was DEAD! I was quite surprised. It was a Saturday night too. I loved the Heirloom Tomato Salad $13 (see pics), we ordered 2 sides the Sugar Snaps with Portabellas and since there were no mushrooms on the menu the server said he could get them for us as a side (we are both mushroom addicts!), my bf ordered some sort of fish but I can't remember. They sent a yummy chocolate dessert for our anniversary.  The restaurant def has potential (great location too!) but just needs more of an atmosphere."}
{"text":"A must go for anyone in  the area.  Best seafood in Scottsdale. Hands down.  Service spot on.  Pete, our server, knows his business inside out. True professional.    Ahi tuna tempora was so tasty and matched only by the presentation.  Crab fried rice was delicious as was the sauteed spinach as sides.  More later, but don't wait.  Go tonight."}
{"text":"Nothing bad to say about this place. Superfast, friendly staff, great Tuna Tartare, Calamari, and the Bone-in Ribeye was cooked to perfection! They went the extra mile on a busy holiday to make us feel special."}
{"text":"Everything was excellent. 12oz filet mignon was cooked perfectly medium rare and very flavorful, and the scallops were excellent. We had both soups as an appetizer and were delighted with each of them."}
{"text":"We went here for the Happy Hour and sat outside because one, I don't have the kind of money to actually eat here, and two, I felt like I should've been in my mid-30's and rich to eat inside...and I'm not. But, hey, I'm of age.   The apps were really good, but this was one of the few times I was able to butcher a quote from Derek Zoolander by saying, \"What is this? Food for ants?\"   Other than that, I enjoyed the beer selection and the feeling that I ate an adult meal."}
{"text":"Wildfish was always one of my favorite restaurants. Tonight I dropped in to have a drink and get take out. The service was horrendous. There weren't that many patrons there, but they were slow in even bringing me a menu and even slower taking my order. The employees were all standing around and outnumbered the patrons.   Regardless of the time issues, when I got back to my hotel I had to get silverware because they don't give to go silverware. Then my food was cold. My hotel was less than half a mile from the restaurant.   I'm not impressed. I will be dropping this from my favorites list."}
{"text":"My husband and I often come here for dinner, enjoying our experiences here. Ambiance is classy and the service is always excellent. Good wine menu, great seafood. Be sure to have the Godiva cake!"}
{"text":"We had a large group dinner here for work. The staff was super nice and very attentive. We had a set menu/price arrangement to make it easier to serve our group. The selections were not disappointing.  The shrimp and crab cake appetizer were excellent. The shrimp has a spicy punch and the vegetables underneath were untouched... I grabbed them and they were awesome! Crab cakes were meaty and flavorful.   I had a petite fillet, which was cooked perfectly and seasoned perfectly. It was a great steak. The brined and roasted chicken was also tasty, but you have to like the saltiness of a brined meat. I recommend a bland side item to take up some of the salt.  The sides of sugar snap peas and loaded mashers were both very good.  Finally, the creme brulee was for REAL. Real vanilla beans, perfect caramel sugar crust, perfect texture and taste of the custard. Really good eats.   They also had a decent wine list... never a bad thing!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had an excellent meal and enjoyed our evening here. It was our first visit so we did not know what to expect but we were pleasantly surprised.  We split the calamari at the bar while we waited for our table. It was a huge serving, For dinner I had the seabass and he had the halibut. It was cooked perfectly and the portions were large. We split a twice baked potatoe and a side of asparagus which were very tasty. We had great service from the bar and dining room and can't wait to visit again."}
{"text":"If I grew up in Phoenix I would probably think this is a pretty amazing place.  However, growing up in the PNW and then living in Mass. for a while I believe true seafood should be from the sea to your plate in a day or less.  Went 3 times.  The last trip I had a shrimp cocktail starter (good), sole (average), and tried someones scallop (good).  However, one of these left me sick all night.  Guess that's what you get eating seafood at a place where should refrigeration fail for even a moment your fish is exposed to 120 F desert heat.  McCormick & Schmick's is a much better choice."}
{"text":"Party of three, two from TX for the Fiesta Bowl (Insert our Buckeye tears here).  This place is owned by the same company that owns Eddie V's here in TX.  Amazing food, great service, and a nice environment.  The truffled mac n cheese was INCREDIBLY good.  The Alaskan Sablefish was the one of the best fish dishes I've ever had IN MY LIFE!   You need some vegetables....and some bacon, so do not skip the brussels sprouts! If you're into dessert, the Banana's Foster Butter Cake is as good as life gets.  They come and set it on fire so it gets that caramelized crust on the bananas.  Then it's served with butter pecan ice cream, which actually isn't too sweet so it's a great complement to the butter cake. It's everything you didn't know you were missing in life."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant!  Always go there for special occasions and its one of the few seafood places I have gone in the Phoenix area that serves good fish."}
{"text":"Awesome, excellent food. Been twice, great both times. Happy hour was great the first time. Table service the second time was phenomenal. I love, love the lobster bisque, truffle Mac and cheese and crab fried rice. I've had appetizer plates both times as entrees...lobster tacos first time- good. Calamari with a spicy ginger type sauce the second time...superbly tasty! During happy hour, sit at the bar to get the deal on drinks and a few appetizers. The lemon drops are really good. Oh and the birthday dessert selections are to die for. Love the pineapple upside down cake."}
{"text":"Excellent place!!! I took my mom here for her mother's day dinner and it was fancy/classy, but cool/casual at the same time. I made a reservation ahead of time, and when I got there the front hostess called me by name as well as my waiter like they were expecting me. It was super nice and made me and my mom feel special. The service was excellent! Our waiter Niko was attentive and polite. The food was amazing and cooked to perfection! We had the Seared Ahi Tuna with Soba Noodles, Wedge Salad with Bacon and Blue Cheese, the Halibut with Sweet Corn and Pork Chop, Crab Meat Fried Rice, and a glass of wine. Everything was perfect."}
{"text":"What is the happiest time? Why it's the happy time that good restaurants sell good eats at half price!!! Happy Hour! (one of my favorite phrases, right up there with \"swim up bar\"  and  \"caviar bar\"). Happy Hour, that's when I go to Wildfish.  Oysters and crab cakes and seared Ahi, oh my! I've tried the other appetizers (the calamari is OK, the salad is a salad, and we sometimes get the iced shellfish tower, which is also pretty good), but these items at 1/2 price and martini's are the main reason reason to go to Wildfish. They generally have a some pretty decent wines at decent prices for Happy Hour, too! The Beautiful Carin and I have had dinner here a few times, when the seafood craving gets to strong for me to resist, and Wildfish is pretty good for Phoenix seafood (I lived in Portland for 40 years and then in SFO for a decade, so I just haven't found anything here in town that measures up to the great seafood places there and in Seattle). The service always seems to be pretty good (it occasionally gets a little bit hectic at happy hour, but not too bad, depending on when you go over there). I really do like the decor and atmosphere at Wildfish, too. The ambiance is really pleasant, and kind of reminds me of the ambiance at Farallon in SFO (I know, no jellyfish lamps, etc., but a bit more understated and subdued lighting and blue tones that offset the wood and metal...just really well done). At any rate, try Wildfish for Happy Hour"}
{"text":"Oh my god.  We came for happy hour (also years ago for one of yelps best events ever) before a movie and enjoys platters of oysters.  Combined with a few vodka sodas I was very happy and full.  I definitely recommend everyone come and try this great place."}
{"text":"Nice bar service. The big lie about the bread is coming continues. Last time I heard their B.S. was 2 years ago. Just stop lying to your customers. Now I remember why I don't like this place. Besides me two other parties left 3 people and 2 people. They waited and waited for the bread that never came. I got sick of waiting. Why not stop offering it? You know it never comes . Who knows how much money they loose on drinks because of the big lie? Do NOT go here"}
{"text":"We recently had the pleasure of visiting Wildfish Seafood Grille for my mother Margarets' 76th birthday.  There were five of all, all with discerning palates and a love for fish, two things which are hard to satisfy when in the AZ. desert.  When we entered until we departed, were were treated like guests never wanting for anything.  Our waiter and his crew were efficient, charming and well dressed, something that goes a long way in the overall sphere of restaurant visits.   To start, Matt and I had the Maine Lobster and Shrimp Bisque, a staple for me whenever I visit a seafood restaurant.  For me, it sets the pace for the evening and allows me to gage the restaurant and compare it to others I have been to.    We chose to pass on other appetizers, all of which looks exceptional, but wanted to focus on our main meal instead.  We opted to share the side dishes so each could chose something they were craving.  Brussel Sprouts with Bacon and Shallots, Broccoli with Lemon & Garlic and finally Sauteed Spinach with Garlic & Parmesan were our choices and each was unique as well as cooked to perfection.  They come in two sizes are great for sharing!  Our main courses arrived, Mom had the Florida Grouper, crisply sauteed with just the right amount of Garlic, she could not have been happier!  Our other guests chose the North Atlantic Lemon Sole, The Chilean Sea Bass, The Jumbo Gulf White Shrimp with Fresh Jonah Crab, and for myself, The Pacific Ahi Tuna steak.  What a great array of tastes, all of which were shared with each other and no one was disappointed!    For dessert, they offered us a Flaming Ice Cream Banana's Foster Cake, set ablaze tableside and a total hit! Sweet, gooey and a fantastic end to a perfect evening.    Although I have yet to be back because of my schedule, I have recommended this place to countless customers and look forward to my next visit!  When you are in Scottsdale and needing your seafood fix, this is a can't-miss establishment!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We celebrated my birthday at the Wildfish Seafood Grille and completely enjoyed our dining experience from start to finish.  The hostess staff was very accommodating to give us a booth of our choice.  The bartenders were extremely friendly.  Our table server was outstanding, along with a team of supporting service staff were perfection.   The menu is fabulous and the food is delicious and excellent.  This is a great restaurant (cozy and relaxing) for a special occasion or just a night out on the town.  We will definitely be back for more scrupulously delicious food!"}
{"text":"We went here again after a 2 year period and thoroughly enjoyed it!  The restaurant is located in the center of the Scottsdale center of business and parking is nearby and free.  My wife and I had entries that were wonderful.  She had the halibut entree and i had the chilean sea bass.  Each was prepared perfectly.  The wine list is extensive.  We had a ribera del diego that was outstanding.  Our server, Dawn, was attentive without being intrusive.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Yep.. Yep. Yep.. Solid meal....  Tried the ahi with noodles, both of the soups, the salad with crab and shrimp and of course the hot bread..  All were very good.  The mojitos were tasty as well."}
{"text":"Happy, happy, joy, joy! Their happy hour calamari And crab cakes are my favorite! When I go there for dinner I immediately get the Chilean sea bass - Hong Kong style! The sea bass just melts in your mouth and so flavorful! This place is a must for seafood lovers."}
{"text":"This place called grill, but on menu almost nothing grilled. Very pricey, small portions."}
{"text":"Some of the freshest seafood in the downtown scottsdale area. I would definitely stop here before the Art Walk on Thursday night, plus the ambiance is unbeatable for a date night restaurant. I don't like oysters, but however they were prepared here.. tasty! The calamari and jumbo shrimp cocktail.....great choices.  The fresh baked bread here is too good to be true. I'm all about fresh bread and I must admit, I was full off the bread before most of the appetizers. hahah I really want to come back here for a full meal, I especially want to try the salmon special. Check out their happy hour! You'll be able to eat the most and save the most money that way. Its to die for."}
{"text":"My previous review and times at wild fish have been amazing. This last time was the worst service I've ever had and sadly probably going be my last visit. The wine was stale and old it was not even drinkable. When we told the manager they said they would take it off, which they did not. We were considered regulars at this establishment. We came in for my mother's happy hour birthday. You would think they would be nice and give good service bring out a cake slice .. Ect ect.. They couldnt care less. Our server seemed very \"stoned\" or was just out of it. She came back to our table twice to ask again what we had ordered which was just two appetizers. When the appetizers came we noticed they didn't look like they normally do. We said something immediately to her,  \"wow, this looks completely different\" her responses \"oh yeah it does...  I'm sure it probably still taste good I mean you don't need them to remake it right..\" We noticed they did not put any of the sauce on it ,or the peanuts or peppers on it, (FYI it was the calamari). The floor had food on it the bathrooms had no paper towels. This used to be a great restaurant and happy hour with lots of people and noise. It was totally dead except for maybe three people. This place is going downhill fast because no one seems to care or have pride in their service or food. It's sad because We used  to come here all the time and bring family and friends and Business partners ect ect  to once which was a fun lively spot where the manager would always come over and talk to us, busboys would clean the table if there was a breadcrumbs. Now, it's  a manager who does not care, food that isn't  even looked over before sent out to the table, dirty dishes that stay on the table until you leave. They didn't even ask to if you wanted more drinks after first rounds are finished. This is not acceptable!  They have lost my word-of-mouth and business."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Had fresh oysters. Lobster bisque and crab corn chowder great. Fish fresh and wonderful service. Went two days in a row we enjoyed the first night so much."}
{"text":"It's hard to get good sea food in the desert, but Wild Fish does a good job.  I won't go into every thing we had at our table, but I can say that everything was tasty and I can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Wildfish many times and have been extremely pleased with both the service and the quality of their seafood dishes. Tonight (1-31-14) I had the uncomfortable experience of almost ingesting an undeniably foul oyster. While I know this can happen it should definitely not happen at a restaurant with Wild Fishes reputation. The disturbing thing about the experience is that the waiter extended us a reduction on our bill that equaled the cost of one oyster. Really, thanks for the service !"}
{"text":"The ambiance of this place is very trendy and modern. The drinks were heavy on the vodka, light on the tonic - just how I like em.   One great thing about this place is that their happy hour menu is half price every night and their portions are not itsy bitsy. The lobster/shrimp bisque, ceasar salad, crab cake, chocolate godiva cake and berries w/cream should be high on your list of things to order off of it.   The staff here is very attentive and friendly as well. My friends and I didn't realize we were the last ones in the place and when we did we felt horrible. The staff didn't mind at all - which is not the norm..."}
{"text":"Such a great place to come and try out!!   Restaurant had great reviews and wanted to see if it would live up to them and it definitely lived up to the expectation!   As an appetizer the yellowtail sashimi was truly non-comparable to other places I've been to, as it was exceptionally fresh and wonderfully served. The miso glazed halibut was very filling and delightfully refreshing!   However, the best part of the meal was the godiva lava cake with the vanilla bean ice cream on the side!! For this alone, I will be coming back!   Service: 5/5 Food Quality: 5/5  Ambiance: 5/5  All in all, lovely place!"}
{"text":"Great spot for seafood. The Wildfish Salad entree is unique and delicious"}
{"text":"I went here with my parents once.  They paid for it, so I'm not used to writing reviews on these kinds of places.  I got the swordfish steak, the lobster tacos, and the pineapple cake flaming thing for dessert.  Everything was spectacular.  I wish I could afford such amazing food all of the time, but one day... Until then, I'll have to wait until Giants Spring Training for my parents to get to Scottsdale to take me out here again."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is amazing. Nice ambience, relaxing music, excellent service. And the food was absolutely delicious, especially the lobster tacos, yuumm !!!"}
{"text":"It was St. Patrick's Day, and I was looking for a non-festive bar or restaurant, one that wouldn't be packed with the drunk noisies. I know, I know, I'm a total party pooper... hey, I'm not arguing with you. So our first stop was the Roaring Fork. I was going to get my St. Patty's green on with some green chili mac & cheese. Unfortunately, the happy hour areas were stuffed to the gills, so off we went to Fashion Square.  We were headed towards Kona until we saw the over-flowing patio, and decided that happy hour wasn't going to be so happy there either, so we opted for Wildfish instead. I've never been to Wildfish, so I was looking forward to trying a new place.  We were able to get a table right away in the bar and their happy hour specials looked pretty good. $5 cocktails and $4 off all appetizers. I ordered the pomegranate pink grapefruit margarita. It came on the rocks without any salt or sugar, and was yum-mee! We also split the shrimp pot stickers and the calamari. The pot stickers were pretty great, with a good amount of shrimp in each one. The calamari was also really good. They're served with red peppers and peanuts, with a spicy sauce drizzled on top.   By the time we left, I was stuffed and happy and only paid $26 + tip. The service was great and efficient, and they have a pretty good sized menu. The patio looked really great too- I'd love to eat outside next time I'm in for a non-happy hour meal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to try something different and have a nice romantic dinner, we came in on a Tuesday night. However, at first greeting, the hostess was the RUDEST and most ARROGANT girl I've ever encountered. Now, I travel a lot for work and eat at many restaurants (all flavors, sizes, etc) and I have never been greeted the way we were (which was like trash). We walked up and she stared at us with a blank expression on her face, like we were bothering her while she was standing around not doing a thing, she still never greeted us. Finally after what felt like way too long, my boyfriend looks at her and says \"two please\". She asks if we have reservations, we say no, she proceeds to become even more annoyed, rolls her eyes and then grabs two menus (doing whatever she can to not make eye contact) and has someone lead us to our table. We were in SHOCK, this is supposed to be a 'classy' place. I'm a business professional in sales and so is my boyfriend. I couldnt believe that the first person to greet you at a restaurant happens to be the most unpleasant person. I'd rethink hiring someone with some better customer service skills and lack of attitude.   Now that I got that one out of the way...(which I still cant believe). Our waitress Talia was a GODSEND!!! She was pleasant, engaging, extremely attentive, went way out of her way and made our dining experience excellent. So thank you Talia for turning the night around...amazing service, great food, HORRBILE hostess, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Yummy!!!   I've been at Scotsdale working on a project for the last 6 weeks and just discovered Wildfish on my last day. Food is yummy!  Being a pescatarian, I'm always looking for a great seafood restaurant.  Plus HH (Happy Hour) starts at 4-10PM Daily!!    Ordered:  Fannie Bay Oysters @ HH price, which came out to $18 for half a dozen. Sooo, silky yummy.  I chopped salad, with lobster, shrimp and avocados for just $12.  A perfect sizing plate if you're not too hungry and shrimp were jumbo size.  ** For all you spicy lovers, they actually have Siracha sauce available too.  Yay!  If it wasn't for the scorching heat of AZ ( AZ=Surface of the Sun) I would consider moving here for a bit.  People are soooo friendly and willing to share their latest foodie discovery."}
{"text":"Has a great Happy Hour 4:00 pm - 7:00 pm Tuesday - Saturday All Night Sunday & Monday. Wines and specialty cocktails are all $5 and appetizers ranges from $5-$9. I have tried all of their Happy Hour food and it is all excellent. The food is always excellent and a very attentive, friendly staff. If you looking for fresh fish in Scottsdale at a great price, your search is over."}
{"text":"Celebrated my birthday dinner with the family last night and I have to to say that I couldn't have picked a better place to eat. Everything was outstanding! Started with a dozen Louisiana oysters and the tuna tartare, both of which did not disappoint. To be able to taste as many dishes as we can, we made it a point that each person order something different and just shared it with everybody. I ordered the soft shell crabs, the wifey had the scallops, my older son ordered the Pacific Ahi Tuna Steak, and my youngest son ordered the  Asian BBQ salmon. You can't go wrong with any of them. For a family of four, we ended up spending around $200 (including tip) but we didn't order any alcohol, it was worth every penny.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice.  The first time I came on a Friday during happy hour, the oysters were so fresh and everything tasted good.  I enjoyed getting the raw oysters and the lobster bisque.  However, the second time I came, the oysters did not seem as fresh and the lobster bisque was very salty.  The complimentary bread was still good, but no one comes to seafood place for bread.  I would have to say I prefer the salt celler in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We went to this place as usual and were surprised to see a \"shrunken\" happy hour menu. We ordered calamari and lobster tacos and were unhappy with these orders. They had no taste and were overlooked. It seems to us the quality of this place is going down!! Sad for that given the fact we are regulars!!!"}
{"text":"The service level is incredibly high, while it's a beautiful restaurant with well-spaced tables and great ambiance.  The food is even better!  We have liked or loved everything we have ordered from Wildfish, and it's one of our favorite restaurants to go to for dinner.  Their dishes are very thoughtful, and they're often prepared in a way that we don't see at every other restaurant in Scottsdale, so it's refreshing to come for something unique to Wildfish.  Favorites:  * Crispy Salt & Pepper Shrimp -- not too fried, lots of flavor, mild to medium spiciness (impressive number of large shrimp for the price! I often make this my entree!) * Pot Stickers -- light, savory, and fresh; a nice option for a lighter app * Main Lobster & Shrimp Bisque -- deep flavor, salty, creamy, divine (hard to resist always ordering this one!) * Chilean Sea Bass -- a really simple, elegant preparation that enhances the flavor of the fish * Swordfish Steak -- another great fish preparation with good flavor without overpowering the fish itself * Crab Fried Rice -- if you like more of a rice pilaf type of preparation, well worth trying as it is rich, creamy, and tasty!  Other things worth trying:  * Steak and Lobster Tartare -- really liked the contrast of the two flavors, and it comes as a good portion * Maine Lobster Tacos -- flavorful enough without overpowering the sweetness of lobster"}
{"text":"This place is great! The atmosphere is classy and fun and the service was great. The bartender knew us by first name and even said bye to us as we left. The food was amazing as well. I split the calamari appetizer with a  friend and it was so good and such a huge portion that we didn't order anything else! A little pricey but totally worth it. Great for celebrating a special occasion, a romantic dinner or just wanting to dress up and go somewhere nice with friends"}
{"text":"I was taken there for my birthday. We arrived and immediately took us to our table. The clientele varies from casual to elegant - women primarily looked elegant, guys not so much (guys, look at your date and then at yourselves before you head out the door!) Drew, our server, showed up promptly at the table, acknowledged our special occasion and took care of us from the start. Food was amazing! The appetizers were delicious; we had the brie, salt and pepper shrimp and the sashimi and for our entrees we had the swordfish and filet and our sides were the Monterrey corn and scalloped potatoes, all cooked perfectly. We had the blackberry cobbler and was good but needed more ice cream to balance the flavors.There were a couple of things I would have changed but nothing to change the score on the review. There was a card on the table, signed by the staff acknowledging my birthday, nice touch.. I noticed those celebrating anniversaries, had rose petals and a card on their table. nice touch!  Someone's review mentioned that the place smelled of fish and I thought \"what an odd comment, being that is a seafood place\" but in deed, it does have a unique slightly fishy smell.. nothing that turned my stomach nor did it lingered, but it reminded me of that review. Facilities were comfortable and well maintained. Parking can use some help!"}
{"text":"Good food. Obviously a great chef. I've been a couple times and have had different plates. All good. Good atmosphere. Have had some slow service but that's my only complain.  Edit: I came back on a Saturday night at 7 pm requesting a table for 2. The hostess informed us that they would not be seating the second half of the restaurant til 8 and we could either wait 30 minutes for a table or come back at 8. From now on I will take my money to a restaurant that wants it."}
{"text":"I've only eaten there twice, but the food both times was very very average... not reflected in the prices. At this price point, the food should be out of this world.   The happy hour specials are decent and the atmosphere is outstanding, but I don't really see a reason to go here unless you want to impress someone with how much money you have. It's not like going to Ocean Club where the food is fucking rad.  I won't be going here unless someone gives me a gift certificate. I put that it's Spendy, but if you get a drink it can easily get you over 60 bucks and into the splurge area. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Dined here for our anniversary dinner and had a wonderful experience. Rose petals and a \"Happy Anniversary\" card signed by all the restaurant staff  greeted us when we arrived at our table. Made us feel special.   Our waiter was professional and attentive our entire dining experience. He came around between each course and switched our silverware and plating and cleared our table of any crumbs with that cool little gadget they use at fancy restaurants.   Food was delicious. Lobster tacos - yum! Crab corn chowder - double yum! Chilean sea bass and seafood platter with king crab legs, scallops, crab stuffed shrimp (special of the day) - so delicious. To top it off, because it was our anniversary, they gave us a choice of any dessert on the menu for FREE! We went with the creme brûlée because we wanted a lighter dessert and it didn't disappoint.   Really impressed with the service and food. The lighting also makes the ambience feel modern and upscale. I would return here in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"We made reservations at the last second for a party of twelve. The atmosphere is upscale and a fairly moderate noise level.  The food was spectacular and the price was reasonable for a business outing ($$$). Definitely on my last if places to visit again."}
{"text":"In town from Pitsburgh for a vacation and it was recommened to try Roaring fork & Wildfish.  The Roaring Fork was excellent but the WildFish was overpriced with the smallest stuffed Shrimp we have had anywere. Every -thing is extra with the meal. I realize Phoenix-Scotsdale if not a seafood hot-bed as back East.  Very average at best."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great, fish entree was outstanding, and the oysters were good- a little small but the taste was there.  We went to Wildfish to celebrate an anniversary. Even though it was a Friday night it wasn't too busy, which was nice. We got a cozy booth and ordered some champagne and the waiter suggest a nice brut.  Is it pricey? Yes. But you're away from the riff raff of Scottsdale and it's totally worth it for a nice occasion."}
