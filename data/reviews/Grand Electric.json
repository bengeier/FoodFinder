{"text":"Let me start by saying I am truly a Latin American food snob. I am fortunate enough to know what the good stuff - the real stuff - tastes like, and I resent those who do it poorly. It's not difficult food to make, but it takes both time and love to create great Latin American dishes, and it frustrates me when I see melted cheese from a jar smeared on store-bought chips that are passed off as \"Mexican food\" in restaurants. So it was a relief and a thrill to hear that the head chef from The Black Hoof was helming Grand Electric and promised, \"Mexican food, craft beer, brown liquor and loud music.\"

I met my dinner companion across the street at The Mascot at 5:45 and watched as a line started to form outside Grand Electric. The baristas suggested we get ourselves over there before the line up got too long, warning us we'd be eating at 9pm if we didn't get it in gear. We dutifully lined up at 5:50pm behind two parties. Within five minutes the line had extended half a block behind us. At 6:02pm, the doors opened and people flooded inside. We were shown to a table for two and marveled at just how quickly the small space filled up. Tables were gone by 6:05 and the bar was full a minute later. Music blared, servers started making their rounds and Grand Electric was off and running.

The bar is quite the thing to behold. Bourbon-heavy, it is run by enthusiastic and well-informed staff.  It towers over patrons and is a great focal point for the restaurant. In addition to bourbon, you can try several craft beers including Churchkey and Canucklehead cask ale. Both are excellent, but if you haven't tried a cask ale, you should know it's not carbonated. Don't let that dissuade you from checking it out, though, as it has a fruity and slightly bitter taste. You'll be hooked after your first taste.

The menu for Grand Electric located at the back of the restaurant on a giant chalkboard. It is split up into appetizers, tacos, specials and dessert. Given the advanced buzz that's been generated, we opted to try as many dishes as possible. We had the guacamole and nachos (an excellent test of a Mexican restaurant's mettle), tuna ceviche, chicken frito appetizers, one of each taco, and in the end, we went for the key lime pie for dessert.

Beers in hand, we eagerly awaited our food which came out surprisingly fast considering the kitchen must have gotten just crushed with all of us arriving at once. First up came the guacamole and chips. The dip was generously salted and had lots of lime juice, essential elements both. Without enough of those two simple ingredients, guacamole falls flat, but this was the best restaurant-made I've ever had (oh, and it comes with a huge serving of light-as-air pork chicharron as a garnish; a great aesthetic touch as it towers over the guacamole & chips). The fresh corn tortilla chips were also both well seasoned and delicious.

A plate of three tacos was delivered to us, and we hung on every word our server said as she explained which taco was which. The first three were the sweet pork belly al pastor with pineapple, the fried queso (cheese) and spicy arbol chicken. It's not that spicy, I promise, especially considering some of the other choices. Of these, the only miss was the queso which I thought could have benefited from some salt. Having said that, the other two were simply wonderful, especially the pork belly.  We also tried the Baja fish taco, a lightly breaded tilapia fillet topped with bright, fresh cabbage. The textures of the soft tortilla and the crunchy, crispy toppings had us grinning from ear to ear.

Not-to-be-forgotten is the chicken frito dish we ordered: a mound of crispy, fried chicken pieces slathered in a sweet and citrus-y coating and sprinkled with healthy doses of cilantro, jalapeno peppers slices and little, red, evil chile peppers. I like heat, but skipped over the red chiles in favor of the jalapenos. Sweet, sour, spicy, juicy, crispy, hot...there was nothing about this dish that should be changed. Ever. I will most definitely be ordering this one again.

Overall, this was one of the most fun and delicious meals I've had in Toronto. The atmosphere is supercharged in the restaurant, filled with happy customers taking pictures of and devouring the food coming out of the kitchen. While you can hardly say that each dish on the menu is truly, authentically Mexican, it hardly matters when it's this good. A word to the wise: go early or you will be waiting for hours for a seat, but even if you do end up waiting, it'll be worth it. There is no other place in the city putting out food like this."}
{"text":"TACOS ! Nuff said. The line-ups are little bit of a hassle but if that really bothers you just go on off hours. Not during the lunch or dinner rushes. 
The tacos are my fav, I usually get the fish and chicken. I always prepare myself to out Hungry man portions but can never manage. The food is so good ! :)"}
{"text":"Tacos are great and so are the drinks. I recommend the Whiskey Sour. They make it different that most places. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the music is a bit loud so it's hard to talk to people,  and there's usually quite a wait. On the plus side you can grab a drink from somewhere else and they text you when a seat becomes available."}
{"text":"Went to Grand Electric last week. Ian, the dude who runs the front of the house, was super nice and welcoming. These guys just want to make good food and play rap tunes. And I'm down with that.

The menu is pretty standard taqueria stuff with some signature items--like the Electric Salad. Everything on the menu was executed well. The beef cheek tacos were delish and so was the baja fish. Avocados; guac are all solid here with the right ripeness and flavor. Bourbon menu needs to be seen and explored."}
{"text":"Finally tried the place!! we went in at 3:55 and was told that they are taking last lunch order in 5 min. I've already decided what I wanted to try at this place so no problem. we got PORK TINGA, BAJA FISH, BEEF SHOULDER, SCRAPPLE and PORK BELLY TORTA. Size is small compare to their price... the torta was so so for me. I loved the sauces on the tacos. Note though the beef cheek is not available anymore."}
{"text":"Incredible tacos--especially the beef cheek ones. The cocktails are brilliant, too (I recommend Jesus juice) although a bit expensive for their size. The service leaves a bit to be desired (a little overbearing and then altogether absent at times) but I'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"So.much.hype!

Absolutely loved Electric Mud before I even tried Grand Electric. Was pretty excited about it but to be honest it's not that special at all

Relatively small tacos, which in my mind do not justify the price tag. Their attempt at the pork belly \"torta\" was pretty dismal too.

I'd sooner go eat at Seven Lives, especially since you'd have to queue for a while to get a seat here"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, amazing tacos. If you've never been there before, they open at 5:30pm for dinner but it would be smart to arrive for 5:10pm if you want to avoid a potentially long(er) wait. 

I'd highly recommend the scrapple (not sure how to spell it), beef cheek, or cauliflower tacos. They are well-worth the wait to get in. 

Only downsides: the music is quite played quite loud, so it's not an ideal location for any lengthy or in-depth conversation. That, and pitchers are expensive."}
{"text":"So I finally made it here this weekend after hearing a lot about the place - I've heard good and not so good things. And after checking it out for myself, I'm going to say that it's actually a pretty fun place. Good music, good tacos, decent cocktails and, well... Pretty good service. Knocking off a star as the waitress seemed a little frazzled but it was busy so I can understand. 

All in all, I'd probably head back when the mood strikes for tacos and hip hop."}
{"text":"I have attempted to try Grand Electric twice but had no luck and third time was a charm. Its a really small place and is always over crowded, wait time is usually at least 45 min+. 

My girlfriends and I had girls dinner on a Monday night and the wait wasn't brutal but because its winter, the wait felt like forever.  

We ordered 2 rounds of the fish tacos, beef shoulders, scapple (I think thats the called), spicy chicken and tuna ceviche.  The fish tacos was my favourite! The fish was cooked just right and wasn't overcooked. I loved the toppings and sauce that was used for the fish tacos. Everything else was interesting. I will definitely come back again. 

Music is really loud so its not really place to socialized and the place is fairly small (not made for big group outings)"}
{"text":"Excellent! I was really impressed by the Tacos and customer service at Grand Electric. We went on a Friday night which guarantees a little wait time as their seating area is pretty small. Their customer service is friendly and fast, and their every taco we had was full of flavour from the very first bite. If you're into the Tacos scene you absolutely have to check this spot out!"}
{"text":"Grand Electric is a cool little spot. Hipster take on Mexican food which I'm not complaining about. They just started to deliver which has gotten some buzz in the city as of late. The food is great, you can't really go wrong with any of the tacos that are all about 3 75 each. I usually get the fish, beef cheek, chicken and pork. All fantastic in their own different way. I tried both the Squid hog and calamari taco. The calamari on hard shell taco is a take on Guu's calamrie dish. Not quite as delicious but I would still recommend it. Overall, it is worht checking out Grand Electric, I would suggest for lunch because there is rarely a wait at that time although they do change the menu between lunch and dinner services so its worth going for both. For example the squid hoggie is on the lunch menu and the calamarie is served during the dinner service. Update: I've since returned to grand E and I'm still loving it. My new go to is head there for lunch and order two baja and one chicken and finish off with a key lime dessert. In all it's about twenty bucks and such a solid meal. Don't sleep on the chicken it's like a delicious mini shawarma and whatever is at the bottom of that key lime is straight crack! Stuff could make Rob Ford drool."}
{"text":"Tacos are delicious and worth the hype. Baja fish was probably my favourite, absolutely loved the guacamole - addition of julienned radish on the top was a very nice touch for crunch and tang. I think the spicy pork was my second favourite taco, I love the crema on top to cool the spice just a bit.

Sampled some other items including the ceviche - very good but a bit too saucy, pig ear lettuce wraps - surprisingly good and a bit nutty in flavour? and the bourbonade - a definite recommendation for cocktails! We shared 2 pitchers between 4 people. 

I will be back! Possibly try the take-out next time, it was definitely loud in there and not exactly comfortable seating but the food makes it worth your while!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, tacos are $3.60 each. My absolute favourite taco is the baja fish.

Don't leave without getting the key lime paso dessert for $5. It's heaven in an 8 ounce mason jar."}
{"text":"Tacos were extremely small. I've experienced a lot better. Super disappointed."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. The atmosphere, the service, the food, the prices. This is the kind of place I look for, and I will be returning. I would recommend this restaurant to any of my friends looking for Tacos!"}
{"text":"extremely over priced, arrogant staff, small portions and very loud music"}
{"text":"Walked in- insta impressed by service/ambiance.
Looked at the menu chalkboard, first the drinks (ok $9 for a glass of sangria what is this world coming to?? Not to mention $6 for a Pilsner which is hilarious since it is on par w/ PBR cheapness but I guess that's what's to be expected at such a ~hipster~ and ~high scale~ place)
Aaanyways food time: vegan-wise, food was measly. Literally only vegan thing on the menu was the guac and chips. There was a cauliflower taco but after asking the waitress she confirmed that the \"sauce wasn't vegan\". Well fuck. There went my hope for taco deliciousness. The guac was amazin though, cilantro city! My friend esentially got every taco on the menu and chowed down, she was lovin it. 

So yeah. Left a little bit depressed from the lack of food I could eat but I can totally see the appeal of the holy grail of Toronto tacos (apparently). Ehh, I'll just stick to Sneaks or Rancho."}
{"text":"Dinner was four stars.  Was seated on the \"heated\" patio.  If i had known my feet would be numb I would have passed.  You know it's too cold when the ice cubes in your drink are still perfectly frozen."}
{"text":"On a Friday afternoon, there was already a line 15 minutes before store opening for dinner service. This seemed to be a good sign. 

We got seated into a small nook when the doors opened. The decor was eccentric and the music was booming, which made it difficult to have a conversation. The menu was a simple list on the blackboard at the front. I went with shredded pork, baja and scrapple tacos. 

Never heard of scrapple before, was told it was pork and corn. But found out it was more than that on a later google search. Pork scraps and corn meal slowed cooked together. In retrospect, would have ordered something else.  

The wait for the tacos was about 15 minutes. We got the guac and salsa, which was quite ordinary. 

I could see why people love this place. Each taco is made with care. The attention to detail was spectacular. A bite into each taco was like a flavour explosion. The scrapple was least exciting one of all. The meat itself was quite bland. Hot sauce was offered on the side on request. 

There was a nice list of tapas type food, which I would definitely come back to try."}
{"text":"i love you grand electric, you make eating just as good as hot sex"}
{"text":"Big line to dine inside, but take out only takes a few minutes.  Really good food, and it would be worth wait though.  Super fresh and not crazy on the sodium.  Since it was my first time, I ordered 1 of each off the take out menu.  My wife loved the pork belly, and I thought the beef cheek was amazing.  I have been wanting to go there for a line time and it lived up to the hype."}
{"text":"Eat here if you want to sit in the toilet for the next 3 hours. 

Had dinner here with my girlfriend. We thought the food was good but unfortunately, when we got home, both of us had stomachaches and got pretty sick. 

We ordered the Baja and shrimp tacos, kale salad, and Mexi wings. I presume that it was the Mexi wings that made us feel so ill because the chicken might have been a bit uncooked. Not sure what else would've made us sick other than that. 

The food was tasty, service was mediocre and after tonight's pain, we definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"Great tacos but never again. The whole forced, hipster, indifferent, \"it's inconvenient to serve you but I'll get around to it when I get a chance and when you leave I won't bother to thank you and say goodnight\", rude service doesn't fly with this cowboy. Get over yourselves."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing, as is the music and the drinks. HOWEVER, cash and debit only is so archaic I can't believe it. Pay the minimal fees and let your customers use credit. Or, how about when your debit is down, rather than telling your customers to go to the store down the road, you invest in your own ATM, or let people know that they will have to hike down the road after dinner to get cash to pay their bill. Ridiculous. We've been here many times, and will continue to support this place IF they realize that inconveniencing their customers hurts their business."}
{"text":"AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING!!! The food is incredible here.   Hands down my favourite taco place in the city.   You can not go wrong with anything and I mean anything!  You won't be disappointed. I do wish thou that the music was a little better and not so loud as I didn't enjoy screaming at my friends."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos, stick with them, the other stuff is decent though.  Unfortunately they don't phone you anymore when your table is ready when waiting for 1.5 hours."}
{"text":"Must tries: Crispy Cauliflower, Roasted Piggy and Beef Cheeks! Also digged the 90s rap music!"}
{"text":"If this place was here before I moved next door (my office is at 1332 Queen St W), I would have moved here for the food :) The food is amazing and makes the ideal place to meet new clients in the area."}
{"text":"Went of a Thursday night at around 10pm and had no wait for a table of three.
I was surprised because most reviews of this place say it gets packed and have had to wait roughly a hour or more.

We were quickly sat by the hostess and greeted almost instantaneously by a waiter.  She asked us for a drink order, we where sitting with our backs to the drinks menu at about a 170 degree angle to the chalkboard of drinks available, making it almost impossible for us to see what was available.  We asked what was on tap and they offered three choices, we stuck with beer and water for the evening.

Once our drinks came the waitress asked if we wanted chips and guac, we said yes.  Our food arrived about 5min later, the salsa and guac all tasted very fresh with bright flavours.  The chips where seasoned well and made the appetizer addicting to say the least.  About half way through the appetizer the waitress came back to take another food order (tacos obviously).  At $3 a pop it is seemed kinda expensive but we where prepared/aware of that going in.  After the order was taken we dived back into our app.  Once most of the chips and gauc were gone a food runner quickly cleared the plate, kinda upsetting because we still had some guac left that we wanted to save for the tacos.

The tacos arrived 3 at a time.  The food quality, execution and taste were all very very good.  I would have eaten more if I hadn't had a larger meal earlier in the day.

This menu size is limited, as is the seating.  This place has a very good vibe, kind quick on the their feet staff who are always helpful and happy to serve you.

Likely to return and recommended.

{"text":"Liked it. Didn't love it. I give them credit for being so busy in a place that was built on the cheap. Margaritas were too sweet for my taste. Tacos were ok , nothing special, the sauce you add after was the best part. I had a salad and all I could taste was the creamy dressing. Too much dressing. Service was very good. In the end , I'm a bit older and am looking for a bit more comfort, I can see why younger people would be attracted. It was absolutely freezing in the washroom area in the basement. I would go back if friends wanted to go, it has a fun atmosphere , but I wouldn't end up there if it was my choice."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town! Service is great.  It is a tiny place so definitely go early to get a spot.  Food is also worth the wait."}
{"text":"Loved this place. My boyfriend and I showed up around 5:30pm on a Friday night and was told it would be about a half hour. We put our names down and while I didn't look at my watch to see how long it had actually been, I'm going to guess it was right around the 30 minute mark or slightly less. Service is really quite fast, along with food arrival. We started with the gauc and nachos, a margarita and a glass of sangria.  There's more than enough guacamole, which is a nice change from most places. 

For the tacos, we each decided to get 3. We each got 1 chicken, one pork, and one beef. When they came to the table, I was a little surprised at how small they were and was a little disappointed. I started with the pork and holy crap is it spicy!! I could barely finish it and was sweating through it ;) but it was delicious. Next I tried the beef, and wow, it was incredible. So tender and full of flavour. Lastly, the chicken was nice and fresh tasting, it tasted like a Mediterranean chicken taco maybe? However, at this point, I was so full I could only eat half and gave the  last 2 bites to my boyfriend. So I guess I was wrong when I thought they were too tiny! 

I really wanted the churros for dessert, but they didn't have them. I got the Pineapple Express, and my boyfriend got the Key Lime.. They were good, nothing to write home about. The music was really, really loud, making it kind of hard to have a conversation, but whatever, it was fine. 


Overall, I can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Was disappointed with the food, but I really wanted to love it. 

Went there last Friday night with a girlfriend, got there just after 6:30 pm. We put our name on the list and got a call nearly an hour later; we waited at a nearby bar and couldn't hear my phone (they called twice) but the hostess was gracious enough to take us in when we finally responded. Points for that!

Tiny place, no wonder there is always a line-up. Nice ambiance though, enjoyed it.

Menus are on the walls. It's kind of dark inside, luckily we were close to the food menu (which was the important one) otherwise they are hard to read. Margarita's were great. We ordered the guac and salsa (pretty good) and the fish ceviche (too much mayo, the chunks were too big and mushy - definitely not for everyone). The beef cheek tacos were only OK (La Carnita is way better), the fish tacos were also alright.

I just wasn't blown away, maybe it was all the hype. I really wanted to love their food but other Mexican places have delivered better."}
{"text":"Stopped here because I was in the neighborhood. 

I must say - I Loved their pork belly tacos and Crispy Cauliflower.  However, my drinks tasted a bit watered down.

The service was slow which was quite annoying since I had an appointment to get to. 

Overall, I would definitely come back here for lunch or dinner or whatever, but only on a day where I'm not worried about being late."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I've been twice and both times have been good. The baja fish tacos are awesome along with the Guu inspired calamari with spicy sauce. The nachos with the guac is delicious as well and full of flavour. I love how they overflow all the dishes with jalapenos. Being someone who loves spice, it was a perfect touch. One last memorable fish was the kalbi rib. Sweet and savory and topped with caramelized onions, oh you couldn't ask for more!

When I went the second time I was craving a bloody Caesar but didn't see one on the menu. The bartender was nice enough to offer to make one for me. It came with a pickled green bean and had crushed ketchup chips on the rim of the glass instead of celery salt, which I thought was a very unique touch. 

Parking can be found on Queen St. My only complaint is that it can get quite noisy (I'm a soft spoken person) and the wait to get a seat can sometimes be a bit ridiculous - I've waited 60 min and 30 min the two times I went, but I've gone before and was told the wait would be 90 mins so I promptly left to find grub elsewhere. In hindsight I probably should have put my name down and then went to Kanji (a few stores down Queen) for some appies."}
{"text":"After many months of hearing about this place and seeing the line ups every time I walked by, I finally made it to Grand Electric for dinner last night - and they didn't disappoint.

The food came out quickly and was delicious... We had the fish tacos, my favorite of all the ones we tried. We also had the beef cheek tacos, and pork belly tacos. I would say that all of the tacos we tried were fantastic. The tacos are small but in my opinion just the right size for this kind of meal. 

We also had the guacamole and chips which was excellent. Guacamole was simple and chunky but very flavorful. We also had the ensilage electrico. The salad was different and was a mix of lettuce, squab cubes, and cubes of pork. It was tasty but the pork was really fatty. Out of everything we had, i would say that was probably our least favorite. 

For desert we had the chocolate and pecans, which was served in a small mason jar and was just the right about of sweets to finish off our meal. 

The atmosphere was casual but contemporary and the server that we had was extremely friendly and attentive. The prices were very reasonable.  I would definitely recommend this place to others and plan to go back again...."}
{"text":"love it. Best fish taco. The beef cheek taco is also very good. My kids love it. It is about 10-15 mins waiting. Very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Pork belly (melt in your mouth), crunchy cauliflower (doesn't taste like veggies in a good way) and fish tacos (not fishy) were to die for! I was starving and initially thought the tacos were a bit on the pricey side for such small servings. But after eating the three, I was very satisfied as the freshness, range and flavours of the ingredients are top notch. So it's more about quality than quantity. When you think about it, the prices are not bad at all. Those who bitch about GE's food ought to henceforth frequent only Taco Bell. That's right, suck it. (I hate crowds, lineups and super loud music so we did takeout. I'd also never paid attention to the hype so didn't set myself up for disappointment.)"}
{"text":"I finally checked this place out on a sunday morning ( the only time when it isn't slammed). I thought the food was ok..... nothing amazing. I think at the end of the day I'll stick to La Carnita..... better overall and not a little sweat box."}
{"text":"Zero stars!!! I rarely rate places but I had too for this one. The tacos are lame, they are the most simplest things to make but how this place has messed it up is beyond my understanding. Everything is sweet even the nachos. Overhyped and over rated!!"}
{"text":"I went to this place last night with a few friends, and sadly, I don't get all the hype...

Our group was put on a waiting list of 2 hours, it's a very small place, where they later called to tell us our table was ready. 
**Not a biggie, small place and can only fit what they can, but just get a drink at Rhino while you wait. 
I also like that they call your cell when a table opens up.

Music was insanely loud, to the point where they make Muzik nightclub seem like an easier place to have a conversation. 

Next, don't ask to work around an allergy or cilantro being on the side. For some reason this poses as a problem. 
They finally put it on the side for me, which every place does--never had an issue, but were not too thrilled.
Anyway, food was quick on being sent out and no goof-ups on the orders, which is nice.

Lastly, after ordering $300 in food, just paying the bill, and digesting our meals, one of the employees asked if we could go so they could use the table for the next group. Wow! I guess once you pay and tip, no use for you anymore. 
I have served before when I was in University, and I would never be able to do that to our customers.  Just saying.
I get the business and turn around on tables, believe me I do, but relax, most people buy a couple of tacos and have a cheap bill, so please show some appreciation for those that spread the word by inviting friends and order everything on your menu. 
It also helps on returning business, especially when this place is not in the best/safest area. 
Anyway, kind of left a bad taste in my mouth when she asked that.

Highly Recommended: spicy squid, baja tacos, coconut cream pie, bourbon pitcher.  Very good!
**Small food quantity, so you'll order plenty of each.
**Food was not the issue, just the customer service needs a little work at times."}
{"text":"I'll make things as simple as I can:

1) The food was good (not spectacular), but definitely good. Worth the price? My answer to that: Kensington Market. You can easily score far better tacos on Augusta for half the price...which leads me to point deux:

2) You can have the food for half the price and without bullshit lineups, excessively loud music and cooler-than-thou hipster staff.

Certainly not the worst restaurant in Toronto, but certainly one of the most overhyped.

Also, I do have issues with the food prices since a couple of friends of mine who work in the resto scene told me Grand Electric doesn't always pay new staff or grossly under-pays them. Not cool."}
{"text":"The place was decent - the food is good, but the tacos are better at Playa Cabana at Dupont and Davenport; too small at GE, hard to eat, and they don't taste fresh.  The drinks can be hit-or-miss - the GE Sour was good, yet a bit too sweet, the Bourbon Lemonade a disappointment.  The staff just misses the mark when they start clearing the plates off the table yet you're not even done; a simple question to establish that fact would suffice.
* Would I object to someone dragging me here lat at night?  No, probably not.
* Would I stand in line to get in?  No, since I don't feel there's anything outstanding to stand in line for."}
{"text":"LOVE! Went the other night as my boyfriend and I both work late and it's hard to find great food when we get off work. Grand Electric has been voted one of the best new restaurants 2011 for a reason! We tried almost every taco and can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu! 

Great food, great price, chill place to go, and worth the wait!"}
{"text":"After hearing all the hype about this place finally decided to check it out. The foods good but its nothing special that you cant get else where. The service is not very good and you really get the get in get out feel. We went at night and sat in the front, I asked the server what something on the menu read because I couldn't read it in the dark and she told me to \"just order some tacos\". The music is so loud you really cant have any sort of conversation. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone or go back."}
{"text":"The food is great. Thumbs up!!! Not a compliant.

The servers don't give a crap about you. No smiles, no warmth... You feel like your being a bother asking questions about the menu. They seems to be impatient since it's busy. Overall, I guess it's not a big deal.

Then I accidentally ordered the wrong drink.. it was my fault.... I mentioned it was my mistake and apologized. I didn't even drink it and asked if it was ok to order something else to replace it. She said yes and brought the new drink.

On our small table crowed with our food and stuff, she left the old drink on the table the entire time. I finally asked her to take it away and she was annoyed. When we got our bill she charged me for it. 

Yes, my mistake... If it was me, I would have taken it off the bill. Why worry about a 3-4$ net loss of a drink when you want to gain repeat business and happy customers. It's not even about $$$, but the overall feeling and attitude. I paid for it and didn't say anything.

When you look around all the servers aren't smiling or looking around at the tables to make sure people ok... Tunnel vision and doing their job. They just don't seem to care.

I was taken there for my b-day, so my boyfriend felt bad for choosing the place... So I felt bad that he felt bad.

Toronto has so many good Mexican places with considerate servers, that there is no reason to go here."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the long wait to get a table (up to 2 hours sometimes). The food is absolutely amazing though and definitely worth the wait. I'd recommend arriving at least a half hour before the restaurant opens to hopefully be one of the first customers seated.

The tacos, especially the fish tacos, are awesome and only $3.50 each. The chicken wings are packed with flavour and definitely a step up from your usual chicken wings dredged in bbq sauce. The tuna ceviche has great flavour and sits on top of a crispy taco that gives a great texture contrast.

Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time the other week, the joint was located in a non-descript building on Queen West. If it wasn't for the fact that there was someone at the door taking names for queuing I would not have noticed this place. After a few min we were taken back to the patio, which was casual/chill/funky. I looked up at the makeshift menu and ordered from their eclectic menu. We ordered 4 different types of tacos and chips with guac with other appetizers. the guac was fresh and tasty. Out of the different flavors of tacos we tried the orgasmic Baja Fish taco... OMG! Tasty baja fish, with sour/sweet tangy salsa and a smorgasbord of different veggies, so many different flavors all coalesced for a unique and tasty treat. Will need to come again and taste the rest of the menu!


Food: 4
Service: 5
Ambience: 5 
Overall: 4 of 5 stars"}
{"text":"All the hype about Grand Electric is well-deserved. 

I figured arriving 20 minutes before it opened would make me among the first in line, but there were plenty of other hungry people with the same idea. The place is super small, and I counted enough seats for 40 or so people and, since they don't take reservations, get there early or be prepared to wait awhile. 

Knowing my eyes are usually bigger than my stomach, me and my friend tried to narrow down our order to a few dishes. We shared the guac and chips and the fried pork rind in the centre was a delicious, and spicy, treat. 

We sampled the Baja Fish, Pork Belly, Pigs Tail and Beef Cheek tacos and, having never tried pork belly, pigs tail or beef cheek, I was beyond impressed. The tortillas are small but packed to the brim with fresh ingredients, and the toppings on each complemented the meat/fish really well. If I had to choose a favourite, it would be the pork belly with pineapple salsa, but I don't like choosing favourites and I'd order any one of these again.  

Good vibe inside: small but noisy, kind of dark but very relaxed. The wait staff is friendly and not at all pushy. Our bill came to a measly $35 (not counting my $60 parking ticket *shakes fist*) but it was well worth the price of admission. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Grand Electric has the best tacos in in Toronto, hands down. The squid hoagie is also absolutely amazing.  Good music, relaxed but helpful service, and great atmosphere makes this place my favourite food spot in Parkdale."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Grand Electric. I decided to forgo the standard gauc (which was excellent last time around), and got chorizo and Brussels sprouts. The dish was too sweet and overly oily. Baja fish and cactus queso tacos measured up to my last visit's tacos, but the Scrapple (although delicious) was gushing oil all over the taco shells and my hand. My friend and I had to ask for additional napkins as there was just so much oil oozing out. Pumpkin pudding for dessert was good. In general, I would stick to guac and tacos as it seems there is a larger margin for error with the other dishes.

Service was much better than last time too. I guess it depends on the personality."}
{"text":"The best fish tacos I've ever had and amazing food overall.  The servers are always excellent but the door staff are rude. Minus 2 stars because of that. It's the first impression when you go somewhere which is a shame because once you get in, everything is fabulous."}
{"text":"Two of my friends had read raving reviews for Grand Electric and we thought it was time to finally try it out. I'm not a big fan of Mexican food but I have to say the food was fresh, unique and delicious.

It's not the typical ground beef with cheese, sour cream and salsa. Instead you are presented with a lovely creation on top of a soft round taco. The sauces and garnishes lie on top of the main ingredient e.g. pork belly bringing out an array of colours; wonderful presentations.

We started off with the Guacamole and Chips. The chips were crispy and I loved the guacamole. I tried the Braised Beef, Spicy Arbol Chicken and Baja Fish tacos. They all tasted wonderful but watch out for the chicken, we found it a bit too spicy to handle. The braised beef taco was very juicy and full of flavour. The Baja fish taco (deep fried fish) was my favourite. The fish was fresh and they drained the oil very well.

The Mexican grapefruit soda by Jarritos was good. There was quite a variety of unique alcoholic drinks for those that are interested. We did not have the opportunity to try the desserts but I heard they were delicious. In conclusion, I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"So I loved it obviously! I really liked the taco with crispy cauliflower because there is just not enough cauliflower play in the world! Honestly, loved it!! Also the fish, but I am sure everyone recommends that. They play grimey rap and hip hop and we somehow only waited 20 minutes on a sunday afternoon... but put in your order and stroll around the plethora of shops in the neighborhood. Yumsies!"}
{"text":"Favourite taco joint in the city!
The interior is cozy and eclectic often with rap music playing in the background. 
My go-tos include their Baja Fish taco (every time! the fish is so light crispy and delicious!) , their coconut cream pie (not sure what those white marshmallow pieces sticking out of the pie but it's THE best), and a bottle of Mexican beer to compliment the food.
I've had their ceviche, chips and dip, as well as other offerings, but I still gravitate towards the tacos as they are always fresh and flavorful and never disappoint."}
{"text":"Short and sweet: the best meat in a tortilla in the city.
Pair that with a great atmosphere and hot service staff and you have an absolute winner.

The worst part is watching people sip on the last inch of their swill for 30 minutes while I stand and attempt to quench my thirst and hunger with saliva. 

The Pig Tail tacos are lovely little patties that melt on contact.  Savor them.
The Beef Cheek tacos might just change my 'Last Meal on Earth' from hot pepperoni pizza to A PLATTER OF THEM.  Divine.
The Fish Tacos are long strips of buttery goodness that is well, well worth the $3.50.

EDIT: Seating 6 at a table has decreased my score to 4 stars.  I think they should not seat 2 extra at a table of 4 - and that the last table of 4 seated should be seated with the extra 2 last.  It's only fair.  If the servers cannot remember who was seated first or last, then look at the bill and seat 6 to the lowest amount.

I was sitting across from a table that looked like the Kennedy's (they were seated first), and yet our table of 4 was crammed with 6 before them.

OK prices. Love this place - will always come back."}
{"text":"I wrote this review on my phone while stuffing my face with their food. For posterity, here it is, unedited.

Fridge good but too saucy. Boar tort a amazing. Spicy chicken is spicy. Good service. Pork  taco delicious . Inside lid music, fun vibe, outside chill, grill, bar, patio..

I can only guess what the fridge being saucy or the lid music mean but seriously, this place was great."}
{"text":"Food was good! Had a mix of tacos! (la carnita is a million times better though) 

Unfortunately, with it being 2016, I have very little tolerance for poor service. Especially for a restaurant that succeeds with the support of its customers. 

Had a food allergy so asked to not add cheese to a taco (instead of offering another item, or actually understanding: how hard is it not to add sprinkled cheese), the response from the waitress was : \"The chef is very particular about his creations and doesn't like to modify his designs\" 

Are you serious? I legit thought she was joking. Yikes is all I gotta say!"}
{"text":"The tacos were delicious and were served pretty fast given how busy it was and that we had 5 people ordering drinks and food. The spicy was decently spicy even for my Latin American friends and it was great to have a good amount of choices for tacos. Fish tacos was the most popular at the table. I tried the margarita and whatever it was with bourbonade. Margarita was great, Bourbonade was weird and def a pass for me."}
{"text":"There were three of us, and we wanted to see if this place was worth the wait and the hype. The food was good although a bit overpriced, but we would have considered returning if it weren't for the horrible, pretentious service. They need to do something about their servers. If customers are willing to wait over an hour for a seat, then at least provide us with some good service! Bad service just ruins the meal, the experience, and you've lost our business. I feel sorry for the kitchen crew as the food was good, 

Very low tolerance for pretentious servers, and I get that this is a \"hip\" place, but come on; do your job! The servers need to be professional."}
{"text":"Best mexican food ever and I've been to Southern California and Mexico! Grand electric does it right with their appetizers and the tacos. Best tacos are the beef cheek, pork belly and fish. The mexi wings , tuna tartare and octopus el Diablo are the reasons why I go here at least twice a month!!!"}
{"text":"I should start off by saying I am addicted to Grand Electric's tacos and guacamole! I'm not exaggerating. It's kind of a problem! 

The Beef Cheek, Chicken, Fish tacos are so good! I could live on them. They are reasonably priced and you can simply order two and just keep going if you're still hungry. 

The tortilla chips and guacamole are DIVINE! They are the best in the city. Period! I love them, my husband loves them and our toddler adores them! 

The only reasons why I'm not giving 5 stars are: you can't call and order take out. They have engaged this delivery service that charges $5 plus a percentage of the order. We don't live that far so it would be handy to call and place an order. 

Second: I've only ever got take out because the atmosphere is not kid friendly. It's very \"swearing, hip hop, hipster\" atmosphere. That's totally cool I only wish they had a second venue where I could go with my fam and feast for hours on their tacos and tortilla chips!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went for lunch after hearing that there is always a long wait at dinner. It got quite busy after we had arrived around noon, and when our food arrived, we understood why it was busy! I had one beef cheek and one fish taco to start and ordered a second beef cheek after falling in love. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"love the food, love the environment, love the baja fish tacos! will definitely return."}
{"text":"Hands down some of the best taco's u can get in the gta....daily shot special is the right fit and Bourbon manu is extensive... Music can be loud at times but it's not a family resto so I can deal but don't know how others feel about it"}
{"text":"Really, really tasty and great service. It seems to be the parkdale hipster hangout with frequent line ups so try going when I went--Sunday at 9 pm. We sat on the patio and ate every taco they had on the menu (some twice), and their ceviche was AMAZING. I also loved my margarita."}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I came in starving and definitely left happy. Had the nachos and guacamole, 3 baja tacos and 3 pork belly tacos. Needless to say we ordered too much food for the two of us, but it was amazing, delicious and very reasonably priced none the less. The baja tacos were exceptional."}
{"text":"Tacos were delicious, as were the drinks. But all in all, not sure it's worth the effort it takes to actually get a table...

The vegetarian option is fantastic, just wished that they had more than one."}
{"text":"Honestly I've come here multiple times and have never been disappointed, the dessert is delicious and great for something small afterwards. And the tacos are extremely well balanced, I would definitely recommend this joint to any of my friends or family. They impressed me from the first visit"}
{"text":"The baja fish tacos are amazing and so are the guacamole and chips, but absolutely hate the loud music.  It feels like they're trying to get you to rush eating because it's hard to take much more of that blaring speaker. I have gotten take out to avoid this issue, but unfortunately the tacos don't hold up very well for long.  It's delicious though and that's why I keep on coming back."}
{"text":"Absolutely great food and affordable too! Great drinks and atmosphere as well. The only thing is that it is usually packed and small in nature - not for those who can't deal with enclosed spaces."}
{"text":"Honestly the best tacos I have ever eaten. I am officially spoiled AND biased now :). I rate them in this order: Fish, Cauliflower, Chicken and then Beef. Also try the Jesus Juice!

As for the restaurant, it's a bit small and the music is very loud but the taste of the food and consistent quality is worth it. If you see a Special you like, order it. I've gotten them twice and haven't been disappointed. 

Overall, enjoyable and delish!"}
{"text":"I give this place 2 out of 3 stars because although the tacos and music were good everything else was lack luster. The wait time is ridiculous and when I had to wait for over an hour just watching a couple talk at the biggest table in the whole place I was about to lose it. They dont have any menus so you physically have to get up and walk over to the black board to read what they have. Instead of giving us a pointless little piece of \"art\" thats likely to be thrown away or left at the table why not just invest in menus?. Also, they dont serve your individual order to you they just cram them all onto one metal plate. They didnt bring us side plates nor did they explain any the components of each dish or the sauces that were on the table we just kind of had to guess."}
{"text":"This place without question has the best tacos in Toronto (fish and pork are a must). Be prepared to wait up to 1.5 hours on Friday-Sunday, but it is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Grand electric and there is a lot of hype about this gem. It definitely lived up to the hype. The only down part is that there is a long wait and they don't take reservations. My wait was 2 hours. Yikes! None the less once we sat down the worst part was over and everything else was fab.

Service - 5/5 

friendly, excellent product knowledge, attentive

Food - 5/5 

My favourite were the Baja fish tacos; they were juicy and delicious. All the other tacos were amazing.

I definitely want to go back but what keeps me away is the wait =("}
{"text":"Really good tacos, interesting decor. Tables are kinda small so squish together with a few friends, tacos are amazing, service is meh, music is loud old school hip hop from both my experiences. 

Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I think the hype of going to this place is the reason it is so busy.... Didn't actually eat here until the 3rd try and I went super early to make it. Went with gf her bro and sis. I like the theme of the place.... Music blasting and it feels live while ur eating dinner lol. The reason I gave it 2 stars is because it is way over priced for what you get.... Our bill came to over 220 for friggin tacos.... And my gf and her sister don't eat a lot...... Cocktails are wayyyyyy over priced and not that good..... The food is good but not anything spectacular..... Tacos are tiny.... I had 12 of them to get full..... Im not fat by the way...... The one thing that was awesome was the octopus appetizer ( really delicious sauce) but again u get a small piece of octopus for like 14 dollars.... Not enough to share...... Fish tacos are good but I think Milagros is just as good and more selection. I'm not one to care if I pay a lot for going out to eat and enjoy myself but I just don't see it here.... I will not go back or recommend to any friends"}
{"text":"We waited 1.4 hours for a table.  But, we just put our names on the list and walked around for a little bit.  We found this place around the corner (head west and turn right) that served sweet potato fries and rum milkshakes and they had a patio - was perfect.  I was a little worried that we wouldn't get the call, but it they called twice.  Anyone who marks down for the wait is just spoiled in my mind - \"oh, they're too popular so I am going to mark them down!\".  Now, if I waited over an hour and the service or food sucked I'd give a bad review.  But, these people are awesome!

We had all of the tacos, the tuna cerviche, fundio (I probably spelled that wrong), crispy pork salad, key lime, and the churros.  They were all blockbusters except I found the chicken taco slightly oily. Tonnes of people described the food better than I did - they're right about how good it is.

What really stood out to me was the service.  They've been packed solid for months and yet they're so attentive to their diners - maybe that is part of it.  This is one of the few restaurants that understand service in this city.  My drinks were never low and empty plates/trays didn't sit around long. We also had food within 10 minutes of sitting down.

For the 3 of us the bill was $85 w/tax + tip."}
{"text":"Believe the hype.

Went for dinner last night arrived at 6:20pm, the restaurant was full and there was already 6 parties ahead of us on the wait list. Crazy yes. But even after a 1 1/2 hour wait, it was with worth every minute. 

Went for dinner with four people, if you are less than that I'm sure the wait isn't as long.

Let me first voice my disgust with a few fellow patrons of the restaurant. There we are, standing in the door waiting for a table. There are two 4-tops of girls, both tables are clearly done their meal, and just sitting there, nursing a half bottle of water (free water that is). One by one, all individually, the take turns going to the washroom, occupying the tables for another 20 minutes. Its not like they don't know there is a huge wait list and that there are people waiting for their tables. Irritating because even the staff were annoyed with them. Staff were super friendly and apologetic about the wait. 

Once seated, we quickly glanced at the menus (drink & food) and got to ordering. All menus are on chalk boards around the restaurant.

 For drinks we ordered: 3 shots of whisky, two Grand Electric Sours ($8), a glass of red wine ($8) & Tecate beer ($6 for a tall boy).  The Grand Electric Sour is their house cocktail, sort of like a whisky sour but with egg white in it. Its pretty amazing, just order one.

Food: all of us were dying of hunger (its about 8pm by this time). We ordered 4 appetizers: Chicken Fritto ($12), Guacamole & Chips ($8), Tuna Ceviche ($8) & Spicy Squid ($9).  First out was the guacamole & chips, both very good, chips made in house. The guacamole had just enough spice & was super creamy. Up next was the Tuna Ceviche which is now my favourite dish in the city. Super cold, tender pieces of tuna, soaked in citrus then piled high and with some sort of white creamy sauce (sorry, I don't know exactly what it was). Served on a small round tortilla chip. The level of flavour in this dish was incredible. So good we ordered a 2nd order of it. The spicy squid was good, reminded me a bit of Guu Izakaya's, red sauce with a bit of bite. The Chicken Fritto was very good as well, chicken wings and drum sticks slathered in a deep red sauce (tomato base i believe) with tons of fresh lime and cilantro. 

Tacos: Best in the city hands down. Tacos are $3.25 each. We all ordered 4 & shared. We ordered the Pig Tail tacos, Baja Fish tacos, Pork Belly Tacos & the Beef Cheek tacos. All were super amazing but the crowd favourite was the pork belly taco with pineapple. 

Even though were were super full, we had to try their version of Key Lime Pie ($5). Served in a small mason jar, the pie elements are layered: graham cracker crust at the bottom, then a delicious tart yet sweet lime filling, then whipped cream. TO DIE FOR. Do not miss it.

If I could give Grand Electric another star I would. Service was professional yet casual, friendly but not in an overly friendly annoying way. By far my favourite meal thus far of 2012."}
{"text":"Whats up Yelp readers I am back, your hood food connoisseur. Today my friend asked me to go here with them - I am usually not the hugest fan of tacos but I heard this place was different and stuff. Checked the menu quick noticed it was affordable and you know what that means use that HST refund money playboy...Anyways on to the review.

I went on a Friday evening with another friend, and this place was RAMMED. I thought I was gonna have to eat behind the bar cause it was so packed. I waited for 15 minutes, and lucky for them I wasn't hulk hungry or else I would've been hulk smashing the place in the name of hunger.

They seated us outside in the back patio which was a nice small secluded patio, where it prob gets a little crazy at night because in the end of the day it is Parkdale. It's like the hood away from the hood. I ordered the pork belly x 2 chicken x 2 signature wings. All of these things were extremely good. The pork was nice soft juicy I am salivating all over my phone while writing this review. The chicken was good, I have had better but this one is still worth a try. I would say that the chicken is def on my list of top chicken tacos. And finally the signature wings - these were the only things I did not like, this is because there's nothing special its the same thing you can get anywhere, Auntie Fee could make this in her portable hood kitchen. Shout out to Aunt Fee holding it down in the US - I see you homegirl do your thang.

****PLEASE NOTE**** There are lots of good looking people - I don't really fit in cause im a lil cow. I can either spend money on clothes or spend money on food, and I choose food every time. I love my walmart and giant tiger clothing. Shout out to them they are my unofficial sponsors it's unoffical cause they don't know who I am yet."}
{"text":"So went resto hopping this past weekend to 3 Mexican joints. This place, La Caranita, and Mexican Amigos. The one thing that stood out at this place was the trendy vibe and dj which was cool, but the downside for me is that the place is so small it can't really sit larger groups. They couldn't seat all of us so a few of us ordered a bunch of tacos and  bounced. I prefer the live band at Mexican Amigos over the dj."}
{"text":"I am a mega fan of bourbon and tacos and ceviche and no-attitude service... so I am pretty sure I need to look at relocating to the west end just to be closer to this food paradise! I've been a couple of times now and actually re-opened my yelp account just to write about how much this place impresses me.

The tuna ceviche and guac and chips are consistently delicious. If you love cilantro and a jalapeno bite you will be completely satisfied after these two dishes. But keep going... the tacos are the best thing on offer. The beef cheek taco won my heart and my tummy's love. I don't know where beef cheeks have been all my life but I would assume they've been hiding from me.... I'm going to eat them all! Tender, well-sauced; you can't go wrong with this choice.

We also had the Baja Fish and Spicy Chicken tacos which were very, very good. The slaw is not too creamy and adds a perfect bite to the fish.

Finish your dinner off with another glass of bourbon and some key lime madness in a mason jar and you have the perfect night. Did I mention the music? I wanted to dance with my tacos. If only that was acceptable. 

The attitude of this place is super chill.... but not so chill that you are ignored. Food comes quickly, the staff knows what they are talking about, and for $60 two people ate till we couldnt walk and drank enough bourbon we were warm on a cold Toronto's eve.

I'll be seeing you very soon, GE. Very soon. :)"}
{"text":"The tacos from this place are by far the best in Toronto.The music is loud but the ambience is amazing.it's a little expensive as compared to other restaurant is it might be comparable to but I can assure you will you have a good time."}
{"text":"Hmmmm,I have been eating here for the past few years each time I am in Toronto. 
I really enjoy the food and the old school rap, and always treat myself to a Whiskey Sour or 3. This December I went, unfortunately, for the last time. 

Things have changed,  you can sense it. The passion is gone. The rap was new and way toooooo loud. For an hour nothing but horrible hip hop, nothing I have ever heard of. Then the whisky sour came in a different glass this time, it felt like holding an ikea orange juice glass or something, I don't know why it bothered me but it did, the old glass suited the type of drink! It wasn't a mind blowing drink this time either. Decent at best.

The food was fine, sure, same as always, but we sat near the stairs to the basement. And this is my largest complaint. The bathroom stuck like satan took a dump down there. You would get mouthfuls of the smell with each bite of food.  And the staff is going up and down those stairs often. There is no way they are unaware of the smell. Something was wrong down there, infact when I hoped to wash my hands before I ate I couldn't stay down there, I basically ran up the stairs. It was so bad the restaurant should have shut down for the night or spent the money and got a professional in ASAP as possible.

Maybe I could have said something. But that is a weird thing to say. I wish I would have just left, instead I rushed through my meal and wasted 80 bucks."}
{"text":"The food was just okay, in fact, I found it to be quite expensive given the size of the portions, they were tiny. Other than that, the place is loud and dim, you can't even see what you are eating. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat there. Service was good though."}
{"text":"Go. Eat. Enjoy. NOW!

Beef cheek and fish tacos were super fresh and really delicious.  Tuna ceviche was great and margaritas were perfectly blended.  

Be prepared for long lines."}
{"text":"Great Taco's, Quick Service. A La Carte ordering is great. 

While you do have to wait for a table if you miss the opening rush, you can give your mobile number and they'll text you when your table is ready - pretty painless considering all the bars nearby to kill time.

The Baja Fish Taco and the Spicy Grilled Octopus were tasty!

The music is intimidating at first but once you settle in, I didn't find it that hard to talk across the table - and they only play bangers, no clangers."}
{"text":"Over-hyped, over-priced, too cool for school attitude from the staff, in a divey atmosphere.  It's amazing what people will accept these days because everyone else is telling them it's cool.

Do I sound too old for Grand Electric?  Perhaps.  But, being a restaurant owner myself, I was absolutely appalled by the horrendous service I experienced on my last visit.  There's aloof and then there's just plain rude.  The service from our server fell into the latter category.  

To begin, the hostess showed us to two available seats at the bar.  Fine so far - she was neither particularly friendly not particularly rude.  Smiling seems to be frowned upon by the wait staff at Grand Electric. 

We take our seats at the bar, and wait a few minutes before our server even acknowledges our presence.  I'm not quite ready to order, and she turns her back on us without a word.  A few minutes later, and our surly, non-smiling holier-than-thou server takes our drink order and our food order.  She goes to the back of the room to put the food order (two pork belly tacos, two cauliflower tacos, and two spicy chicken tacos) into the POS for the kitchen, then returns behind the bar to pour my beer and fetch my dining companion's bottle of Negra Modelo.  She puts my beer in front of me about as far away as it is physically possible to place it on the bar, forcing me to reach across the bar to get my beer.  This may seem like a small matter, but I truly believed that it was intentional, and was indicative of her attitude towards me.  I obviously wasn't cool enough, in her eyes, to warrant attentive and courteous service.  

So, we drink our beers, one Red Leaf, one Negra Modelo, both cold and tasty, and about 10 minutes later, our food arrives.  The order is almost completely wrong.  Sure, there are the two pork belly tacos, but alongside them are two fish tacos and two beef cheek tacos.  We state the order is incorrect, and it is whisked away with scarcely an apology.  I actually think our server grunted with annoyance as she returned the food to the kitchen.  I see her return to the POS and re-send the order.  I don't know how the mistake was made, but no big deal, these things happen.  

As we continue to wait, a bearded baseball-capped gentleman (who I assume is the manager) apologizes, and assures us the food is on the way.  He is courteous and smiling!  Someone in the place who apparently seems to understand the importance of good service!!  Kudos to you, whoever you are.

Finally, our food arrives.  The spicy chicken tacos arrive first, and after my dining partner picks off all the chopped cilantro on top (she hates the stuff - no fault to the kitchen here...), we dig in.  First, we are struck by the tiny size of the tacos.  These things are SMALLL.  The flavour and texture is okay, nothing to write home about, but also not terrible.  The sad dried-out lime wedge is a travesty, however, particularly now, what with the lime shortage.  A tip to the kitchen - don't cut limes too far in advance, keep the insert covered, and cut around the pith.

Our non-smiling server tries to grab the empty plate (a round aluminum tin tray) away and I stop her, as we want to keep a plate handy for the rest of the tacos, so that we may both have a plate to eat over (no side plates were provided).  She scowls and drops it back down.

Not long after that, the pork belly and cauliflower tacos arrive.  We start with the cauliflower tacos.  Quite tasty, good crunchy texture, but overwhelmed by what appears to be a mint and cilantro sauce.  The pork belly tacos are fatty and satisfyingly porky.  Both are decent, but again, nothing to write home about.  At some point the bartender notices my drink is empty, and asks if I want another.  I order a shot of Four Roses Bourbon, on special at $4. Tasty.

We inform our server that we're ready for the bill.  It arrives ($44) and I leave $47.  Not a good tip, I know, but that's the point. 

To conclude, this was my second time at Grand Electric, and I will not be returning.  This place simply does not live up to the hype.  The wait staff (with the exception of the guy who I think was the manager) apparently seems to think that being rude to the patrons is somehow okay.  It isn't.  That, combined with the shitty decor, the sub-par over-priced food, the obnoxiously loud hip hop, and the fact that I had to stretch my neck in two different directions in order to see the food menu and the drinks menu (seriously, people, you're a very busy restaurant - surely you can afford to print some menus!), results in me giving Grand Electric 2 stars.  To all those who think I'm nit-picking, and I just don't get this place, please, it's all yours.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"This place is as good as everyone says. It's busy but you can go across the street to the Rhino for a drink, and they'll txt you when a table is ready. I ordered almost the full menu to try."}
{"text":"'place rules. 

I'm not even a fishy type of guy but their fish tacos easily trump all other things on the menu.  

1 star for their boilermaker bourbon/beer/otherthings : amazing

1 star for good service  ( once we got inside! no reservations, long wait, really long, three pints at the rhino long )

1 star for the tunes. because they're fun & hip.

1 star for I took my girl on a date there and it worked! 

you won't not enjoy your time there!"}
{"text":"4 out of 5! Another great authentic Mexican restaurant! Avg wait Friday night is 4 hours.  Recommend the calamari"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! The food is amazing and it's shockingly inexpensive. My only problem is that it's way too small to be so popular. I live nearby and lately I've been seeing a line-up forming outside this place by 5:30 on weeknights. If you want to eat here, you're going to be waiting 1-2 hours so plan to put your name on the list as early as possible and then go for drinks somewhere close (I recommend the Rhino)."}
{"text":"Amazing fish tacos, I can't even remember what the other tacos taste like. The batter is so light and tender, I compare it to candy."}
{"text":"Used to be so good... This update is based on my most recent 3 consecutive visits. Chips and guac were so over salted all 3 visits. Tacos fall apart now with one shell instead of two. Servers are crusty as f*ck. The staff used to be so cool. Also an extremely douchey and drunk patron was being extremely loud and belligerent. He actually started to try and start a fight with us as we were minding our business eating our dinner. Staff did nothing. Really disappointed as this used to be my favourite joint."}
{"text":"Tiny dank taco bar... this is a great gem  in Toronto. Best tacos and the drink menu/wall is extensive-in a good way.  Their tacos are $3.60 each but what does it matter after you eat a dozen of them while being slightly tipsy on their $4 shots. I could eat this shit all day and the music is bangin'. Just go there"}
{"text":"It was good but not great.  Is it worth the wait? I don't think so.  It's super loud, they rush you out and the food is just ok."}
{"text":"We visit grand electric regularly. I've tried lots of other taco joints in Toronto but I always return to grand electric. They consistently have great, friendly and quick service and amazing food. The fish taco and pork belly are my favourites. Best part about this place is the prices are super reasonable."}
{"text":"Still great. 

Got in within a couple of minutes on a Monday at 9 pm, sitting at the bar - score.

Things were still real good, though just a tad less exceptional than last time.

The Grand Electric Sour (bourbon-based, with egg whites, agave syrup, pepper) was delish. Spicy squid was very good, though reminded me of Chinese food. The ceviche was also very good, but didn't have that same exceptional kick as last time.

The tacos are still basically incredible. Tender beef cheek...amazing fluffy fish...delicious chicken...

Still the best Mexican resto in the city."}
{"text":"I attempted to try this restaurant twice before I actually got to feast here! Their lineups/wait times are ridiculous if you don't show up right when they open (6pm). My two girlsfriends and I got to try this place and all I have to say is that it totally exceeded my expectations! It was delicious and I can't wait to go back!! The decor is nice and their staff are so friendly and helpful.

We tried the nachos with pig rind, tuna ceviche, pork belly tacos, baha fish tacos, chcken tacos, and beef cheek tacos. All were amazing and the prices were affordable too!

Thanks Grand Electric for an unforgettable meal. My tastebuds were dancing!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night with my girlfriends so it was really busy! They have a system where they text you once a table has cleared so you don't have to wait awkwardly. The staff was so friendly and nice. We ordered the beef cheek, shrimp and Baja tacos and the ceviche. They were all so fresh and flavourful although the ceviche had a bit too much lime.

I would also like to note we sat on the patio (so cute by the way) at a communal table. I felt bad for my friend because she is really tall so it was really hard for her to squeeze in the middle of myself and some strangers without accidentally kicking us. So if you are tall, get a seat on the end or wait for a private table."}
{"text":"Be prepared for a line up and a wait as this new taco joint in the Queen west hood is hot!
On a brisk Tuesday evening, we arrive around 7pm to find that the resto-bar is packed with rowdy diners.  We are told that the wait time would be more or less an hour which we expected and we put our names down/ cell phone given and we go across the street to the Rhino for a drink. 
 Approximate wait time = one hour and 15 minutes before our cell phone rings to inform us we are in!
We are seated in the front communal table near the window.  I personally love this spot as we can always look outside and people watch but it's a bit chilly as it's the closet to the door. 
Our server tells us that the menu is on the chalkboard behind us and that we are welcome to get up and walk around - it's almost encouraged.  We also are told that there is only one cocktail on the menu heavy with bourbon and it's the grand electric sour.   It's a twist on a bourbon sour with the frothiness of egg whites and a hit of vanilla at the end. 
We start off our evening with guac 'n chips.  It comes with a fried pork rind (Chicharrón) in the middle.  We also share the chicken frito appetizer which is a mound of crispy, fried chicken wings.  We are encouraged to use our fingers and get dirty with these delicious chicken pieces slathered in a sweet and citrus-y coating and sprinkled with heat from spices and of course chilli peppers. Yum!  We are off to a good start!
Now moving on to what we came for, the $3.50 tacos. While they are small, each of them pack an intense flavour and all the ingredients work together to compliment the taco.
We order a smattering of pork belly al pastor tacos, baja fish, the queso poblanos and I also order the beef cheek because I cannot resist!
We get our first platter of pork belly tacos and my beef cheek.  The pork belly were juicy and tender.  The beef cheek was similar to pulled pork and had some kick which was delicious.  The second platter came with our fish tacos and queso poblanos. 
Our fish tacos were crispy and similar to an order of fish and chips in a soft tortilla.   I would say my least favourite taco was the queso poblano tacos.  I found it a little bland.  The queso (cheese) and the stewed poblano pepper needed a little more punch.  It was a slow heat but it was subtle. 
One word of caution, don't leave your tacos sitting out as the sauces and ingredients drench through the soft tacos making them soggy and creating a hot mess!  We were victims of some taco failures!

If you come to Grand Electric for dinner, make a night of it."}
{"text":"My favorites are baja fish, spicy chicken and key lime pie for dessert. The flavours and textures are unique and explosive. The size of each taco is perfect for taking a few bites so you have room left to explore the rest of the menu (which gets updated a lot of times).

Bartenders, servers, and hostesses are always nice as they can be. This is surprisingly wonderful seeing as how busy the place can get.

My only complaint would be the loud banging hip hop music blaring at all times. Its really hard to have a conversation with someone sitting right in front of you. Luckily we live close by so we are fortunate to have delicious tacos in the comfort of our own home. We get take out on a weekly basis.

I really liked their outdoor patio which feels less loud and congested than indoors. I hope they bring it back this summer!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time the other day for lunch! My friend who I went with told me it can get pretty busy at night so we decided to go earlier on in the day and got a spot on the patio out back! 

The patio is so cute and it was so peaceful that I forgot that I was in Toronto. My friend and I both had the pork belly, fish and shrimp tacos. We enjoyed all but the Shrimp was our absolutely favourite, We ended up getting another round of shrimp tacos, they were that good! 

Overall, really enjoyed my meal here and would be interested in checking it out at night to see what the vibe is like then."}
{"text":"First time trying since we just did not feel like waiting in line for an hour or two.  Today, however, we took the day off work to see what the hype was all about.
Well, to us, it was really worth taking the day off.  Got there at 5:10 so only had to wait 20 minutes for the doors to open.  
We had 3 different cocktails, the guac and chips, 4 different kinds of tacos, and the spicy squid.  Every morsel was amazing.  We were really too full for dessert but we found out that Ian wanted to give us a dessert on the house, so we chose the key lime.  Again, very delicious.
We found the service to be friendly and efficient.
We will take another day off to come here again!!

Note: cash or debit only; no reservations; all party members must be present to be seated; very loud"}
{"text":"Overpriced, overhyped, beyond underwhelming and a true testament that hipsters have no tastebuds and will eat garbage as long as it's labelled \"cool\" and \"hip\" by their friends. 
First off, the tacos were cold/lukewarm and the wraps were so wet/soggy that they tore apart as soon as you picked them off the plate. The fact that the wraps were cold and soggy was an indication that our order had been sitting out for awhile before being brought out. 

The pork in the tacos was so incredibly tough to chew that I had to spit them out. The Baja fish tacos (which are my usual go-to) were absolutely disgusting. Like the other dishes, the fish was lukewarm, and the batter was so soggy and undercooked that it literally sloughed off the fish like skin does with 3rd degree burns. 

Another issue was the service. The front line staff are just so indifferent to customer experience and satisfaction. They could not care less if you have a poor experience at the restaurant. Our issue was that there were no tables so we had to sit at the bar and our orders were brought out on \"shareable\" plates when we had each placed orders individually. The whole sitting at the bar part was fine, but when you're in a group sitting alongside one another, bringing out shareable plates of tacos is probably not a good idea because you're passing a plate back and forth like you're in an assembly line and now each individual has to try and pick off tacos that break apart as soon as you pick them up. Couldn't the restaurant have used some common sense and made it easier for us by just placing each individual's order on separate plates? I mean, they didn't have an issue putting different tacos all on a couple of plates. Why not just plate them by order? When asked if the kitchen could re-plate them, the vegetable server who clearly couldn't answer a simple question, just stood there blinking like she was deaf and dumb. No answer, no apologies. And to top it all off, they came back and asked us if we wanted dessert! Like we wanted to waste more time and money there. No thanks.


This place is well past its expiration date. It just needs to go. What is the point of a taco joint when it can't even do tacos well anymore? Isn't that the whole point. Food for thought because you're better off going elsewhere."}
{"text":"2 stars for effort. 
Overhyped, overpriced and over-sauced tacos. We had one of each kind and I would  only be willing to have seconds of the beef cheek. For the others, the combination of condiments did not compliment each other. Most where filled with over-powering sauce, be it BBQ, mayo, pickled slaw, which limited your ability to taste anything else.
Maybe it was a bad day, but the fish was limp and did not taste fresh.

Cocktails were ok to average.
Service was fair to good."}
{"text":"Best mexican food in all of Toronto.

I undertand people's hestiation to come here because of the potential to wait for up to 2 hours for a table, but it is well worth it.

I have been twice, and have tried nearly everything on the menu. For apps, I highly suggest the soup and the ceviche. The ceviche has nice tender pieces of tuna soaking in a great sauce. The spicy squid was so-so, as there was a bit too much of the sauce, and you could not really tell that it was squid.

For the tacos, you must try the fish tacos. They were perfectly fried on the outside, while the fish inside was still juicy, moist and tender. The beef cheek tacos are also excellent, though I find a little underseasoned (lacks a little pinch of salt)."}
{"text":"I love love love this place. Everything on the menu is good! Spicy squid  is amazing! I personally like the stuff under the \"more\" menu a little more. Unfortunately the line up is extremely long :( They aren't kidding when they say a 2 hour wait! Better go on a full stomache!"}
{"text":"You're still looking through the reviews? Didn't you notice there were more than 50 and they're at 4.5 stars overall?

Yes, it's that good.

Try everything."}
{"text":"Been here many times, I think Grand Electric has done everything right! Decor, attitude of the staff and the food and booze mean it's an instant hit.

The Baja Fish taco is a winner,  but the portion are small, so order up more - because the wait can get long. Wanted to try the Miami ribs, but they had the peanut ribs on the grill as well - I'm all for spicy peanut ribs, but not when there are severe nut allergies. Wished that the al pasdor had a little more flavour, but wicked selection of bourbon and whiskey. 

Toronto still can not measure up to the Mexican food in Cali and Texas... but it's getting closer..."}
{"text":"My wife and I are in agreement -- this place is OK, but we're not going back.    

The food was just OK, the atmosphere was damaged by music that was painfully loud,  the service was not very warm and welcoming, and on top of that, the price was high.  

Lunch for my wife and I was $80, this included a number of taco's that still left us a bit hungry at the end, my wife had 3 glasses of wine, I had some Lemonaide.  I think $80 can buy better food and a better experience elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food was great and so was the bourbon (huge selection).

The problem was that once we were finished our tacos, we were not allowed to order any additional drinks (no drinks after you finish your meal).   I had to talk to the manager before we could order one more round of drinks.  It somewhat put a damper on the otherwise great experience"}
{"text":"One of the hottest restaurants in T.O. right now as conferred by our wait time for a table (2.5 hours).  We left our number and went on with our night for some drinks first, still contemplating whether we should honor our place in line for a table as we could get hungry within that lengthy wait time. But being the hardcore foodies we are, we stuck it out and waited..waited..and waited. Sure enough it was only 2 hours later that the hostess called us and we rushed back. We sat at the bar which was ok for us and immediately preceded to ordering as we were STARVED.

We tried one of their tuna ceviche dishes which my SO found to be too sour but I thought it was alright and tuna seemed to be fresh. We ordered one of each of the tacos they had available that night and that's where the true magic happens. They are some pretty tasty tacos done extremely well. I would have to say, La Carnita has some competition in town. One of the things I really like about the tacos here is they are willing to experience with non-traditional cuts of meats (must be the Blackhoof genes). Which I love as true Mexican tacos use every kind of tail/snout ends in their tacos which makes it that much more adventurous. We ordered a second round of tacos and at $3.50 a pop it's definitely wallet friendly. We'll be back but hopefully the wait time dies down, I think the guy mentioned they are in the process of opening a patio in the back as well before summer hits so that should dramatically increase their capacity. 

Good luck to all who try to venture out."}
{"text":"The reason I'm giving it 4 stars is only for the interior. The place is like a bar on a road in Mexico, very small. And I guess that's the point of it. The food is amazing and I guess that's how they popular. For me it is a place to go and have great Mexican food, I wouldn't go there to hang out. The service is friendly as well."}
{"text":"love their tacos! got their pork belly, chorizo, baja fish and octopus el diablo.

everything had a great taste of flavour. i'm not a fan of onions and cilantro which they put too much of it in but that's just my personal taste. their taco wrap was a little too small, i wished it was bigger so i can wrap all the toppings. my favourite was the chorizo and octopus.

luckily i didn't have to wait for a seat as i arrived relatively early. they have very limited seating, i had to sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Delicious tacos - the fish and pork belly were my fave, but I loveeeed the squid with guacamole on top! Definitely a must try. Atmosphere is good, service is alright. Music is really loud but it was good."}
{"text":"Grand Electric has taken over the old Cafe Taste space and somehow it looks even smaller than it did before. That's not really a bad thing because it is quite nice inside. The exposed wood wall behind the bar looks great. I'm not sure what happened with the bar itself though because it looks like it came from an Ikea catalogue.

There are quite a few places to sit and they obviously wanted to make the floor equally welcoming to groups and pairs. There are two larger areas for groups near the door and tables for four and two scattered around the room with lots of seating at the bar.

I wish I could have had more to eat but four tacos, two Grand Electric sours and a Lime Varro beat me. The beef cheek was great and piled with fresh jalapenos and the pulled pork was equally good. I had one fish taco and the mild spice was a nice surprise. My desert was amazing. If you like key lime pie you will love this. Lime custard topped with whipped cream and lime zest sitting on a cookie. Excellent. I really want to go back and try their pozole.

Our servers were accommodating and up beat. Everyone on staff had an ear to ear grin on their face the whole time which was really nice to see. Take note, they do not take reservations but they will take your name and put you on a waiting list. I was told that it would be an hour wait but got a call fifteen minutes later telling me my table was ready so don't be afraid to poke your head in and see what's what.

I would have gladly given this place a 5/5 if it wasn't for the two things, first; it feels really really crowded in there and I got caught in a traffic jam trying to get in and leave. There might be a few too many tables there. My second and bigger issue was the music was way too loud. We were sitting less than three feet away from each other but had to yell the entire time. Their music selection wasn't bad but they couldn't fit a dj in there if they wanted to. It wouldn't change things anyway because he'd be playing the same thing and really, do you need a dj in a restaurant?"}
{"text":"food 5 stars 

(i had the baja fish taco, beef cheek and chicken taco. I think the chicken taco and baja fish are tied for the best!!!)

Honestly thus far, best tacos i've ever had in my life.

Service 3 stars

Very average service, a bit rushed and lacking but whatever

This place is jammed packed, i went here 20 minutes after the store opened for lunch and i was able to grab one of the last tables. There's really no place to move or anything. The only time I would come back is to do take out

This place is a bit too hipster for me"}
{"text":"Honestly I'd really rate it a 2.5 stars....it didn't live up to the hype at least for me and my fiance.  

We came here on a rainy Friday afternoon soon after it opened so we didn't have to wait in line. 

The first thing I noticed about the restaurant was their extremely loud music.  I like rap music...but it was so loud that I felt like the only way to have a conversation was to speak into my fiance's ear as we were seated at the bar!  Is this a sign of aging? I don't know...but if I have to be at near shouting levels to have a decent conversation....I'm not too pleased. 

The second thing I noticed was that it was quite dim in the restaurant. Now, I understand that people like dim lighting for ambiance but really....it was quite dark.  Turn on some lights!  I'm not sure if it's because it was sort of rainy that day or what...but really....

We started off with their calamari which was delicious.  I bit into a pepper seed which unfortunately left me feeling like my mouth was on fire...but even still...I have to say that I did enjoy the dish.  

Next we ordered the baja fish tacos, pork, beef cheek and scrapple tacos.  Our favourite by far was the beef cheek.  It had a nice sweet taste to it....and we like sweet meat.  The fish tacos were ok...nothing to rave home about.  Our greatest disappointment was the scrapple.  The server tried to explain to us what it was but because of the super loud music...we only heard bits of what she said.  From what we understood...it was a mix of pork neck and pork back meat?? To this day...I still don't know exactly what scrapple is.  Anyway my fiance and I love pork neck which is why we decided to try the scrapple.  It came out in this strange rectagular brick....almost reminiscent in appearance to tofu that was fried.  Anyway....it was definitely not what we were expecting and was not enjoyed. The texture was kind of mushy and the taste wasn't really that good....

Overall...I wouldn't make the trek to Parkdale to eat grand electric again.  I like tacos but I don't think I'm the biggest fan of Mexican food - it may be a bit too spicy for me.  Regardless....I didn't think that their food blew me away to the point where I would say that I would come back and their loud music and dim lighting certainly didn't add to their attractiveness."}
{"text":"Great staff! Good food. Fast service. Small restaurant. No reservations taken.Nice atmosphere. Limited menu choices. One of many good choices of restaurants in the area. If you want great mexican food and was going to make an effort to go to one, I'd select another restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal and you must eat here at least once. The portions are smaller than other Mexican places I've been to, but the flavour is through the roof!

My favourite was the scrapple taco, although the pork, fish and beef tacos each had strong claims for that title. The guacamole was perfectly balanced and even the homemade tortilla chips were bursting with salty lime flavour!

I can't wait to get back here, and am excited to try their BBQ place around the corner."}
{"text":"Absolutely fell in love with this place. I came here with my girlfriend last week and it was phenomenal. Amazing for when you have a case of the munchies for from Mexican food. My girl is a huge fan. We will be back."}
{"text":"Not as good as I was expecting. I had the pork belly taco and it was too greasy, but the server recmd it. Baja was pretty well the best one. Tried a few more they were OK.."}
{"text":"I consider myself something of a taco connoisseur and these are my favorite in the city. My wife thinks the Baja tacos are the best tacos she's ever had, while I'm partial to the chicken. Either way, worth both the size of the horrible crowd and how horrible said sizable crowd is. 

So. Many. Beards/Pork Pie Hats. 

Good tunes are a bonus. Seats are full-on second grade school chairs, which is cute and ironic and everything but also kind of a bummer. Place is crowded as shit.

One of my favorite places in the city."}
{"text":"Finally got to try Grand Electric last night, and it lived up to the hype!  After trying several times before, we got lucky this time.  We just happened to pass by on our bike ride home from work, put our names on the list, and 1.5 hours later got a phone call to say 2 spots at the bar would open up in 5-ish minutes.  It took us 10 minutes to get back there, but we still had to wait for a few (10?) minutes before the other couple actually left.  So that's the way to do it.  Put your name on the list and come back when you get the call.

The music is loud and the lighting is dim, and overall it's a very cool vibe for such a tiny little place.  Even though we were sitting at the bar, we still felt like we had enough privacy and plenty of space.

The tacos we tried:
Beef Cheek (definite hit, I'll order more next time; have them with the red salsa)
Baja Fish (delicious; tender, fried fish that literally melts in your mouth)
Chicken (very good, a good standard)
Pork Belly (very good, a bit sweet.  I'd choose the other 3 over this one, but I'd order all 4 again).

Also: 
Empanadas (the pastry was so crisp and warm and great; the filling was good but I could pass on this to try something else next time)
Chips & Guac (because how can you NOT have chips and guac at a Mexican restaurant?  Delicious!  Warm chips!)
Key Lime dessert (smooth, creamy, fresh, we fought over the last few spoonfuls)
Churros (filled with some sort of caramel, so not what we expected, but we loved them!  warm, and just fall apart in your mouth).

The most pleasant surprise for me?  How nice the staff were!  After all the hype I've heard about this place, I expected all kinds of attitude, but not at all!!  Everyone was friendly, welcoming, and good-natured.  

We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Muskoka location several times and just absolutely loved all of the food.. thought I would order UberEats from the Toronto location and had quite a different experience.

the baja fish and the spicy chicken tacos were pretty standard..  the baja fish being deep fried was obviously a little soggy by the time it got delivered but that was expected

the pork belly taco had a delicious hoisin Asian-style sauce to it.. and the mission wings, a great mix of sesame, sweet and savory flavor to it and was massive in size.

the guacamole and beans with NO tortillas was a minuscule portion for $8 and was very underwhelming. Chiptotle serves a bigger portion for $3 and with chips! 

also on the UberEats menu and not on the Toronto or Muskoka menu is the pork crackling or chicharrones.. it reminded me a lot of like the Asian-style prawn chips.. super light and airy.. almost like eating foam.. only the pork rind was much denser and harder on your teeth.. and it came with a salty-spicy powder that we weren't quite sure what to do with it but dip the crackling into it... rendering it slightly more palpable."}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing tacos in Toronto. Anyone who tells you otherwise is crazy. 

The only thing to complain about is the wait. I recommend getting there at 5:30 for the dinner sitting at 6 pm if you get there at 6:30 pm you are waiting 1.5 hours. 

The holy trinity is the Beef Cheek, Fish, Spicy Chicken. Trust me! The smaller the group the better, cause you can sit at the bar and eat quickly."}
{"text":"Although this is not authentic, I really enjoyed it! 

We started off with chips and guacamole. The guacamole was not special but it was good. It comes with a large pork rind seasoned with something spicy that I thought was unique and yummy. The salsa tastes smokey and spicy which I thought was tasty.

I had the pork belly al pasteur, chorizo queso, and beef cheek. The pork belly had the right amount of flavor and was delish! The chorizo queso was good but did not stand out like the pork belly. The beef cheek was a little dry, however just add some salsa and it's fine. 

This place is not good for groups - a max of 4 to a group would be able to sit together. I did come early to beat the lines and I recommend it. I did find the music a little too loud, but that's probably why this place is not good for groups. You are either sitting at the bar or in a cozy table so you can still hear each other since you are so close in proximity. This place does not take credit cards but they do take debit.

I think this place is worth coming back to but not to wait forever like some others have mentioned. Just come early and you will be good."}
{"text":"Hipster tacos place. It's small and sometimes it'd get too crowded. You may have to wait in line for a long time. It's LOUD. Haven't had a taco that I didn't like there though."}
{"text":"I used to go a lot to Grand Electric when they first opened but with so many Taquerias options in Toronto and added to the fact that you need to wait for 45min to get a table (in average) I decided to explore other options. After taking a break for a few months, I decided to go back for Lunch.
 
The place is still cool and hipster. A shark coming from the ceiling with a LA Kings hat, menus on the wall, and a decent bar with plenty of bourbon to choose from. The music is loud and conversing is quite a challenge. There was a couple with a baby having lunch and the baby could not stop crying. I felt sorry for the baby but I cannot blame the restaurant for it. I don't know why some of the TO restaurants insist in having super loud music. I love music and I enjoy a fun environment but when it is so loud that you cannot keep a conversation unless you ask the same question 3 times.... It feels a bit lame.
 
The drinks menu has changed for the better as now you don't find egg white in most of their drinks. Yay! My drink was too sweet but I liked the Thai Basil touch. It was refreshing.
 
The tacos remained pretty much the same but with the addition of the corn taco (which I had but did not like it much). The pork tinga is still great and the basa fish delicious! My boyfriend loves their tacos because they are soft and fresh.
 
After eating in so many taquerias lately I don't know anymore which one is my favourite. Oh, the key lime pie was very good!
 
Would I come back? Yes, for sure!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to get drinks! Amazing selection of whiskey to choose from. Also a really nice environment to sit and chat with someone- although the music can be quite loud sometimes. Good atmosphere overall. 

I'm not as big of a fan of the tacos, however! Too much cilantro, which tastes like soap to me. The tuna ceviche is really amazing though."}
{"text":"Been here many times. Was there Sunday night and was underwhelmed. Ordered the calamari which I love and it was not hot. Cold soggy calamari-yuk. 
Ordered the cauliflower taco and mushroom taco and both were not hot.  Wasn't even that busy-no excuse for cold food. What really made me not want to come back though is the choice of music that they were playing that night. I take offence to rap that continually uses the n word. Can't for the life of me understand why the manager would choose this for the playlist for the restaurant???  Our server told us the manager picks the songs. Either find less offensive songs or get a new manager!!!"}
{"text":"For the long line I waited in here I was mediocre, I mean 3.50 for a taco is a good price, but I wouldn't go back as a favourite. 
The staff were very nice though!"}
{"text":"The tacos were superb. 3 for $10. six people, 23 tacos (fish, beef cheek and pork belly), tuna ceviche (so good), six tequila shots, four pisco sours, 3 beers, 1 glass of wine, $220.00 tax and tip included. 1.5 hour wait for a table at 7:30 on a thursday but we were a group of six and the did take our phone number so we could go have a drink nearby while we waited. Hottest hostess in life (those eyes!). Every bourbon. Great back patio but not opened yet."}
{"text":"Great taco's and drinks.  A little too self important for me though.  Come on people you're making taco's."}
{"text":"They don't accept Visa card and provide take-out which are the only two bad things.

Other than that, I must say I really enjoyed the food here. I was sitting at the outside bar which covered by heat. It's actually not that cold. 

The food comes fast and the price is reasonable. I ordered taco squid and another one which I forgot the name. But it's really crispy and I liked it!!!"}
{"text":"Great Tacos But Poor Service.

Ordered the fish & shrimp tacos. They were absolutely delicious. 
The service however is very poor & unorganized. Had to flag down our server numerous times. Our server was also extremely rude. She never came to the table & when I finally flagged her down to pay for our meal she threw the debit receipt at me and ran away. Not so nice when you leave a large tip. Quite embarrassing as I had a friend visiting Toronto for the first time."}
{"text":"After hearing about how fantastic this restaurant is from a friend I ended up going to it with him.

We were seated at the counter pretty quickly even though I had heard that this place his a lineup after a certain time. 

The music was way too loud, it was difficult to hold a conversation unless we were speaking into each other's ears and the interior felt a little crowded, the waitresses bumped into me on several occasions. I mean that'd be understandable if I was a large person but at 5'7 and 120 lbs bumpage is just inexcusable; there should be either fewer tables or more attentive waitresses.

We ordered a scrapple and beef cheek taco each and a half rack of ribs to share. I was surprised at the size of the tacos, they were about 3 inches in diameter. Who knows, maybe Taco Bell advertisements have skewed my perception of tacos.

The scrapple (bits of pork and corn fried together in the shape of a rectangular prism) was pretty good. It was topped off with spicy mustard.

The beef taco didn't really leave an impression on me. It was pretty bland even though it was garnished.

The ribs were actually quite good even though they were far from fall right off the bone tender. They were topped off with peanuts and had some sort of barbeque sauce.

The service was very good, all the employees were smiley and polite and were quick to change the bottle of water between me and my friend when it was depleted.

I'd be more open to rating this restaurant higher if it wasn't so overhyped. Yes the food is good. No it's not worth waiting an hour + in line for."}
{"text":"Verrry good. 

My favourite was the scrapple (pork scraps) the sauces they put on it were amazing. All the others were yummy too, we also had the baja fish, chicken and cauliflower. 

The guac was good but not the best I've tasted.

It was also too dark and loud to easily have a good conversation but the food made it worth it."}
{"text":"4.5 stars

Well, Grand Electric lives up to the hype. For a place with the word \"Hipster\" beside \"Ambiance\" on the profile page, GE had zero attitude.  Yep, we had to wait about 20 min in the cold, but it was worth it.

Spicy Squid (AMAZING.) a tower of perfectly cooked and seasoned calamari rings with chilis, herbs and avocados. 

Brooklyn Beer, Bourbon-ade both delicious.

Tacos, we had Scrapple,(?) Fish, Beef Cheek, Pork Belly (note it has Pineapple), Pig Tail and were in agreement that Pig Tail and Beef cheek were our favourite. We have had fish tacos in Baja, So I can't say these were the best I have ever eaten. Best in TO, for sure. 

One thing to note is that the space is MUCH smaller than I expected. GO on an off hour, get the squid and enjoy yourself. Dinner for two until stuffed, with one drink each $60."}
{"text":"Been here twice now with varying success. Many hits but also a few unfortunate misses.. 

What I Ate:

-Baja fish tacos. Damn, these are good. Nice big piece of crispy fish and loads of fresh delicious toppings. You're getting your money's worth with this one. 

-Spicy chicken taco. MEH. Nothing really stood out to be honest. Won't order again.

-Pork belly. Was disappointed with this as I love pork belly but it was pretty dry.

-Spicy squid. Super tasty and piled high on a crispy tostada. Had the perfect amount of spice with some added guacamole and crema to cool it down a bit.

I'll mimic another poster here and say, yes, please double layer your shells because I had a hell of a time eating my food on the second visit. The things basically fell apart from the bottom and I had to ask for a fork to eat the rest.

What I drank:

-Think it was called Rosemary's Baby. Vanilla and rosemary infused bourbon, grapefruit and agave (?). Well this one was better on the nose than in the mouth. Smelled nicely of vanilla but unfortunately couldn't detect any rosemary in there at all. But at $9 a cocktail, who's complaining?

Service wise they were a bit all over the place. There was one super friendly guy in there who served us when we were first seated at the bar. Really attentive. Unfortunately when he was busy doing other things we were left waiting to order another cocktail for about ten minutes. There was another bartender whose attention I was trying to get but he seemed uninterested. Was half empty in there too.

Despite this, I will be back. Probably many times.. The vibe and music make it a great spot to hang out and the fish tacos are some of the best I've had. Plus they serve Brooklyn Lager and that beer has my heart."}
{"text":"O.M.G. This place is incredible!! Hands down the BEST tacos I've ever had. I came here with a taco enthusiast to say the least and we were blown away by the flavors and variety of tacos here. I had to order another shrimp taco because it was SO good!!! I could come back here everyday and eat all the tacos because they're that delicious. We're only in Toronto for 5 days and will be coming back here at least twice to get more! The kale salad was also fabulous and a nice compliment to the feast of tacos. And not to mention the awesome drinks too!! It's not everywhere you can find a fresh, high quality mint julep but they have one here! Don't miss this place if you're in Toronto. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I am on the hunt for the best fish tacos around the city and I have to say Grand Electric is definitely up there on my list! I love the atmosphere, anywhere that combines Mexican food with loud hip hop music is fine by me. The nacho chips are a little greasy but the delicious tacos make up for it. In terms of drinks I personally think they should add an Old Fashioned to the menu but the Grand Fashioned is still pretty tasty. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"What we ordered:

- Guacamole and Chips
- Baja Fish Tacos
- Crispy Cauliflower Tacos
- Pork Belly Tacos
- Chicken Tacos
- Beer: Negra Modelo

The Good:
- Everything we ordered was seemingly made in-house and was noticeably fresh. 
- For $3.50 a taco, we don't have a single complaint -- each and every one of them were delicious.
- The service was friendly and prompt.

The Bad:
- The guacamole was average in taste and way overpriced for the portion given (...$8.50 for approximately 4oz). 
- The music was far less in the background than it was in the foreground -- it was blaringly loud for such a small space. It made conversation nearly impossible, which really detracted from our experience.
- The patio is available for special occasions only, which is disappointing on a nice warm day --  especially when the interior is dark and noisy.

In short, we'd come back for the tacos, but would leave if the music were as loud as it was today. 

**As an added note: They do not accommodate separate bills."}
{"text":"Read a review on an air plane magazine and thought we would give it a try. Turns out to be probably the best soft tacos we have ever had! Great staff and good prices. Couldn't recommend more!"}
{"text":"I ate here with a friend last week and was blown away with how good the food is! WE ordered about 5 dishes off the menu and I don't think there was a single one that we did not enjoy. The tacos were absolutely incredible!

The restaurant definitely has the 20/30 something hipster vibe of most restaurants in Parkdale, but I enjoyed it how casual it was. 

Will definitely be back in the near future!"}
{"text":"My girls and I decided to have a taco dinner at Grand Electric a little while back because we were so intrigued by all the hype. The line up at Grand Electric was kind of ridiculous due to the overall size of the restaurant itself. Seeing that the restaurant is fairly small, we had to wait closely to an hour outside the restaurant (there is no indoor waiting area) for our table. The waiting is not so bad, being outside and all, during summer but during any other seasons, when the weather is rainy or cold, it's not something you would want to do. The tacos at Grand Electric is not bad, my personal favourite was the beef shoulders and spicy chicken. I wasn't a fan of the scrapple at all, but others might think otherwise, it wasn't as flavorful as I had hoped it to be. We also had the tuna ceviche as one of our shared dish which was really good. Lastly, dessert! We ordered the key lime and it is pretty much What you expect key lime to taste like, nothing really out of the ordinary in my opinion. Also, I found the alcoholic beverages there to be too strong for my liking. The overall experience was okay, I wish I had tried the Baja fish tacos though!"}
{"text":"Foods are delicious. Baja fish taco & tuna ceviche are the best. 

Cons: no place for hanging your purse if you sit at the bar"}
{"text":"This got to be my favorite Mexican resto in Toronto. The food is delicious. Not too expensive. The only down side....the place is really small....it might be quite a wait...."}
{"text":"Best freaking fish tacos in downtown! That's all I have to say... I was never a fan of fish taco's before but a friend dragged me here and wow, I can't believe I have been sleeping on these for so long, their amazing! (at least at this restaurant)

Only downside is that they are a little costly at 3 dollars for a small taco but I would rather pay for quality over quantity any day. Will keep coming back for these little suckers! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere and super friendly service! We started with the tuna ceviche, which was super good. The in-house beer was super scrumptious and my rosemary bourbon cocktail was excellent. I would say this is a great place if you want to come for some good tacos and hang out with some friends :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, tight and eclectic. Loved it. Wish it was open later, great boozie late night place. The company I had especially made it worth the while. Bourbon and tacos, so brilliant, check it out."}
{"text":"The Food here is amazing.  Top five in Toronto.  The Loud Rap Music also contributes to the great vibe.  Believe the hype."}
{"text":"delicious food, eclectic drinks, great music and the servers are so nice. overall definately deserves 5 stars. 

Recommend the chips and guac, and the spicy squid for sure"}
{"text":"Line up was so not worth it. Cool place and sloppy food. Too saucy and too sweet. Definitely not true Mexican. May go back for a drink but will pass on food"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Grand Electric for ages now! With all the positive reviews, I really wanted to taste those tacos for myself and see if they were worth the hype. And the verdict is...me thinks NOT! 

The last time we wanted to try those tacos, we couldn't as we were in no mood of waiting for 1.5 hours to do so. This time around, on a Wednesday evening, the wait was a more bearable 30 mins. So we had a drink at nearby Cadillac lounge till we could get seated. 

Coming to the food, we ordered a bunch of stuff as we wanted to try it all!! 

We started with guac and chips - the guac was just ok and the chips were a tad too oily! We also tried the octopus el diablo and the spicy squid. The octopus was very well seasoned and the highlight of our trip to Grand Electric! The spicy squid was good but nothing special. 

Tacos - we tried the Baja Fish, Spicy Chicken, Crispy Caulifower, Beef Cheek, Pork Belly and the Scrapple - in short, we tried them all. My personal favourites were the Beef Cheek and the Baja Fish. 

Desserts - Key Lime and Electric Dirt. Both were really good! 

Bottomline - The tacos and the food overall was quite good but I wouldn't wait an hour plus to have them! Also, the place is fun and trendy but the music is quite loud if you're planning on having a conversation!"}
{"text":"Great tacos and drinks, but the staff just need to smile a little more. Super weird vibes from the staff."}
{"text":"I am giving grand electric a score of 4 stars for overall food, cocktails and ambience, not food alone. I want to state that first.

Its no secret grand electric sky rocketed to queen street west west popularity very quickly and word of mouth is definitely why. First the food - I had one of every taco and though they're tasty, they're not the authentic kind of mexican I prefer. I personally, have been spoiled by amazing Mexican in California. The tacos seem to have too much white sauce on them - is it like an aioli or a sour cream? Too fussy for me. The ceviche was good - nothing to write home about but very fresh, I appreciate the quality product of course.

The cocktails were fantastic! Well crafted, delicious, and refreshing made with fresh ingredients - this is what will bring me back here. 

I am a huge hip hop fan so I love the ambiance and the music. 

Overall, I like you grand electric, but don't think I'll be back for a dinner line up, more of a small bite and cocktail after 9 kind of night."}
{"text":"We went b/c a reviewer said these were the best tacos he'd ever had.  I will totally agree about the fish taco -- amazing.  If I go back (just visiting Toronto) I'd maybe get just 3 of those.  I also had the cauliflower and the pork and they were good, though kind of paled in comparison to the fish.  We also had the crispy Brussels sprouts and while I skipped what was underneath, those delicate little leaves of the brassica family had me salivating long after they were gone.  

Great music, great atmosphere, great service.  If I lived here, it would be a go to spot."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, given the price.  The ceviche was outstanding, along with the Baja Fish Taco. Of all the other tacos, the Beef Cheek was probably the best - a more traditional recipe with guacamole sauce and jalapenos - followed closely by Pork Belly Al Pastor and Pig Tail. The flavours of the Spicy Chicken Taco seemed a little mismatched, and the cheese taco wasn't as mind blowing as the other ones, although maybe it was just hard to compete.

We ordered what seemed like a ton of food and clocked it at only $20 each. What's pricier here are the drinks, and it does seem like the food might be a delicious loss-leader for what's ultimately an ultra-hip bar. I wished the ambiance was more restauranty and would have preferred Mexican music to gangsta rap. That, plus the two hour wait (got there at 6 PM on a Saturday) bumps this down to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Finally, after months of talking about it we made the hike all the way to park dale to try this place.

To start, we got super lucky! We strolled in around 7:30 (supposedly peak time!) on a Friday evening and got seated almost right away! It was suppose to rain but it didn't, and we got a terrific spot on the patio!

We basically ordered everything on the menu. My fav was def the fish taco, hands down. My friend enjoyed the pork belly one more I believe. Their thin cut beef ribs were also delicious, but my fav had to be this thin crust pizze type of thing with scallop and other seafood with a interesting lime mayo sauce. That was the star of the night. 

We got both the chocolate and key lime dessert, both were delicious, all depends on personal preference. 

overall, it's a great place with awesome atmosphere. 
Why didn't I give it 5 stars? 
1. It's too far out of the way 
2. The food was great, but not.... GREAT! It's been hyped up so maybe my expectation was higher.
3. would I wait 2 hours for a table here? NO."}
{"text":"OK, so the wait is 2 hours, so just plan ahead. Drop in put your name down, go home, go to the Rhino, wherever. 

Make sure you get the chips and guacamole, it's probably the best I've ever tasted.

My favorite tacos so far:

Pig tail, baja fish, and beef cheek. The spicy chicken or chili cheese didn't do it for me (as much).

They have a policy of no take-out....but if you're very nice the waitress might sneak you some tinfoil to the table so you can bring a few out to share with your friends who didn't want to wait.

The Grand Electric Sour (vanilla infused Wild Turkey bourbon base) is pretty good. The chelada drink is....gross unless you like cheladas (think beer + spicy clamato).

It's cheap for how good / cool it is. So enjoy that.

I can't wait to become the DUKE of this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I are frequent visitors. There's usually a long wait, but there are a couple bars near by to grab drinks while you're waiting. I loooove the ceviche. Baja fish tacos are also amazing. We ordered a bourbonade. We actually saw the bartender use frozen minute maid from concentrate (I remember those as a kid. They came from the grocery freezer and in a cylinder shape container). After seeing that, it seemed silly to pay 11 bucks for a bourbonade that would cost a dollar to make at home. Nevertheless. Love this place!"}
{"text":"this is where hipsterdom and mexican food meet.

it is awesome.

the tacos are fantastic.

so many layers of flavour - it is truly delightful mowing down on their crafty concoctions. 

the meat is tender as f( )ck. 

the spicy squid is next level.

go here."}
{"text":"We love Grand Electric but we don't have patience for the long queue.  So we took a 12-month sabbatical from it.  Last month, we decided it was time to return to our favourite taco joint.  Well, things have not changed much, the queue is still long and the tacos here are still as good as ever.

There are several new items we absolutely love:

Scrapple Taco is one of them.  We saw people ordering it left and right, and had to try it.  It was love at first bite.   Crispy on the outside and soft-mushy goodness on the inside.  Topped with avocado, green onion and a sweet/savoury sauce. 

Spicy Octopus.  Tender, perfectly grilled octopus with a salty and spicy sauce.  I love the mint, it adds freshness to the dish.

Pineapple Express is another winner.   Roasted pineapple + custard + praline combination is divine.  Electric Dirt is another new addition, the kick from chipotle and richness from the chocolate pudding was a great combination.

Grand Electric still has a great vibe.  Friendly staff.  Continually great food.  We are still in love with the place."}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed by the food here.  We had several tacos and none of them were particularly. good.  My wife and I both felt bloated after eating there and that never happens to us.  We're still looking for good mexican food in Toronto."}
{"text":"Probably the only place on earth where I am willing to wait 2-3hours for a table to try their tacos and copious amounts of bourbon. Every time we go here the quality is amazing. They have a wall length chalkboard of bourbons to try and I've only made it through 6...I think there's about 30 or so? Basil Hayden= amazing! Cheap food. High consistent quality. Amazing bourbon list. Plan to visit a bar before putting your name on a ridiculous wait list when you go here...but they make it worth your wait 100% of the time."}
{"text":"Superb food, service could improve.

We ordered a beef cheek taco and baja fish taco each, in addition to guac & chips with salsa ( so good), tuna ceviche and desserts. The food was excellent in portion size, taste and value for what you get. I also had the sour ( made with bourbon) and you can taste a well crafted drink ( a bit steep at $9 but worth it) the only complaint i have is that the waitress kept harassing us to order more food when we were clearly relaxing and chatting. Plus it gets so loud in there you can barely hear the person beside you speak. Overall, great for a quick bite, delish !"}
{"text":"Had so many people recommend this restaurant. We got there on a Tuesday night and still had to wait 45 min to get a table. Had a drink at a bar down the street and they called when the table is ready. If you are starving and not willing to wait might not be the place for you. 

Once we say down the place was small. We sat at the bar. Nice part was they were playing some good hip hop in the background. 

We ordered there specialty whiskey sour not a big fan and a Tecate (cerveza)

Things we ordered 
the special for the night tongue and onion rings ... I was being adventurous that night and tried it... I don't think tongue is my thing but the onion rings were bomb. 

Ceviche was average amazing. It was more creamy then sour which is not what I think ceviche should be like

Baja tacos was the best taco there l
Scrappler taco  was pretty good 
Beef cheek taco was dry I wouldn't order this again

Service was really good the bartender was super nice and explained everything as we were newbies.

Price is about 20 -25 per person with an alcoholic drink which i think is a deal. 

Overall I would give this restaraunt a 3.5 out of 5 but since I am feeling nice I will round them up to 4."}
{"text":"We showed up 20 minutes before it opened on a Wednesday might and we were first in line - but just barely. That is how popular this place has become. After eating there for the first time, I can safely say that I know why.

When you first arrive at Grand Electric, the first thing you notice is how small it is. The place can only seat about 30 people and even that low capacity is achieved by seating groups of four at a table so small that it would barely accommodate two in any other restaurant. Despite the intimate nature of the space, it has a very good vibe and is a fun place to eat. 

Now onto the food. It is very impressive, especially for the price. We started with the guacamole and chips and they were easily the best I have had in the city. The chicharone in the centre was a nice bonus. Next, we had the spicy squid. While I will not say it was the best thing on the menu, it was nice to try a squid preparation that had not been battered and deep fried. Moving on, we had the menudo, a classic Mexican soup. The soup had a very rich broth with some nice chunks of pork and vegetables mixed in. I would definitely have this again. Finally, to finish our appetizers, we had the tuna ceviche. I love tuna but I usually hate ceviche because it is either a) made with raw tuna that is not of a high enough quality to serve raw or b) coated in so much lemon juice to mask some nasty taste. This preparation had neither problem and was rich as any raw fish I have ever had. I would go back for this item alone.

After finishing the ceviche, we decided to move to the tacos. I ordered the fish, pork belly and beef cheeks. While all three were good, I found the fish taco to be the best. The fish was lightly battered and yet incredibly moist - a difficult balance to achieve.

I am excited to go back and try the few items that I wasn't able to stuff into my belly and I hope that this place remains a vibrant part of the culinary scene in Toronto for years to come."}
{"text":"Have you ever eaten a fish taco in the mosh pit of a raging hip hop concert? What? NO!?!?

Well it's your lucky day, because Grand Electric has thoughtfully simulated that experience for you at their Parkdale location.

All joking aside, the staff of this restaurant are likely deaf. Which explains why they continuously blast music a few decibels louder than a fog horn throughout the evening. Hey, I like loud music as much as the next person, but this is downright insane. I'm not exaggerating, there have been times (with different groups) we've had to ask for our food to go because we:
a) can't hear one another
and b) are concerned for our ear-health (?)

I've asked countless times if they could turn it down a notch, and more than once the server has explained that they'd like it turned down too, that they can't hear their patrons, but the owners have made this a \"rule.\"

Well this is a weird freaking rule.

Their fish tacos are f***ing unbelievable, but just not worth breaking an eardrum over."}
{"text":"Overrated. The food was good and the ambiance is great,  but not worth a 2+ hour wait. I'll go back when they hype dies down and I can get seated quickly."}
{"text":"Both times I've been here, it's been packed! The tacos are great. The back patio has a really cool ambiance. Inside tends to be a bit loud and only gets louder because people are trying to scream over the music. But the food is what's important, and they've got that covered."}
{"text":"This place does have the best tacos in Toronto. The new renovations are pretentious. I kiss the dark stormy parkdale vibe it had. Now it look retail and a chain. Very disappointed. During dinner peak hours I've had to wait for good for a while. They don't take reservations but if you can wait it's worth it. The margaritas are very acidic. I stop ordering them."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my dinner at Grand Electric - but I'm not sure how eager I am to go back.

Arrived around 6pm on a Wednesday night, and we only waited in like for a few minutes before we were seated at a table with two others. A little stranger danger never killed anyone (this is blatantly untrue) so we decided to be friendly and ordered drinks. They were delicious, I had a margarita and loved it.

We ordered the ceviche, some tacos (I liked the fish and reallllly liked the chicken) and the guac. All the flavours were solid, and the food came out quick. REALLY QUICK. Quick enough that we probably would have eaten and ordered more but our tummy's were so quickly assaulted by the food that we didn't have time to process. 

I wanted another drink but there was a huge crowd growing outside, and our table by the window made us feel a bit like animals in a zoo. Service was good, the bartender who brought our drinks was fun and cool, our server was good if maybe a bit pushy on sales, I wanted to whisper to her that I knew what she was doing and she just chill.

All in all, fun, tasty and busy - maybe the newly opened patio will lure me back."}
{"text":"Tacos are out of control. Drinks are out of control. But be prepared to be a bit squished into bar/tables since it is pretty small. The music is also so loud you can't really have much of a conversation. If you can deal with all of that, the food is well, well worth it!"}

Extra information:

*Opened by ex-Black Hoofers
*Open 6 nights a week
*Closed on Tuesdays
*Limited menu item

Grand Electric has created quite a buzz on social media even before it opened. Even I found out about it before their opening date and everyone on Twitter was talking about it. Ex-Black Hoofers or not, I love Mexican food so it immediately went on my go-to list.

All their drinks and food items were written on the black board which were placed all around the restaurant. It's quite dark in the restaurant plus the writing is pretty small so if you don't have good eyes, you would have to stand up and walk up to the blackboard to read the menu like I did.

Ordered: Michelada 1/5

*Tecate (Mexican beer) with Caesar seasonings for $7
*I saw that they had Horchata on their drinks menu which I was excited about, but it was no longer on the menu
*In terms of 'cocktail' drinks, they only had this or the Grand Electric Sour 
*I don't like vanilla-creamy type cocktails so I went with the Michelada
*I did not enjoy this at all
*I am sure it's suppose to taste like it is but to me, it was beer with caesar seasonings and it just wasn't pleasant
*I would just rather get regular beer or regular caesar

Ordered: Guacamole & Chips 5/5

*Plate of fresh corn chips served with guacamole and salsa topped with deep fried pork rind for $8
*Corn chips were super fresh, crispy and crunchy
*Guacamole was very flavorful with red onions and cilantro with the just right amount of lime juice
*Salsa was tasty as well but I would have preferred it with a little more kick
*Perfect to share between 2-4 people for an appetizer
*One of the best guacamole I've tasted

Ordered: Tuna Ceviche 4/5

*Pieces of raw tuna served with red onions and cilantro with lime dressing on top of deep fried taco shell for $7.50
*This was another good appetizer
*Lime mayo dressing on top with all the fresh vegetables went really well with the crispy taco shell
*This is hard to share and it is small in portion 
*Overall has very refreshing taste (almost like a salad)

Ordered: Shrimp Tostada 5/5

*Pieces of shrimp served with fresh vegetables with lime dressing on top of deep fried taco shell for $8.50
*This was exactly like the Tuna Ceviche but with shrimp
*If I was to choose betwen Tuna Ceviche or Shrimp Tostada, I would get this one
*The sauce and the fresh avocado pieces balances out the sour marinade on shrimp
*Shrimps were big and juicy, went well with the dressing and I really enjoyed this dish

Ordered: Chicken Frito 3/5

*Plate of chicken wings with sweet chili sauce for $14
*5~6 pieces of chicken with lime, cilantro, green onion and chili
*This was one of the bigger dishes of the night
*Wasn't sure what to expect but it tasted Chinese-Thai fusion
*It was nothing special but the sauce was tasty

Ordered: Spicy Arbol Chicken & Pork belly Alpastor & Baja Fish Taco 5/5

*Taco is $3 each
*All 3 were really good, but Spicy Arbol Chicken was my favorite
*Spicy Arbol Chicken Taco was bursting with flavor but it is quite spicy
*Chicken was juicy and it went really well with all the vegetables (lettuce & cilantro) on top
*Pork belly Alpastor tasted like pulled pork
*Usually I don't like fruit in my savory food, but it complimented the flavor and I really enjoyed this
*Baja Fish Taco was really refreshing and it was almost like fish & chips in a wrap
*This was my first time trying fish taco and the fish was really soft and went well with the sauce and radish served on top
*They were the best tacos I've had until now, they are a MUST order!

Overall, I really enjoyed everything I ordered at the Grand Electric. I could tell that all the ingredients were super fresh and the flavors were strong in every dish. However, I would like to point out that a lot of their dishes use same vegetables/sauce so a lot of the dishes could overlap in flavor. Also, if you don't like (or hate) cilantro, I would stay away from this place. But then again, you expect cilantro in every dish at Mexican restaurants.

Ordered: Key Lime Vaso 3/5

*Key Lime Pie with whipped cream for $5
*By the time I was done with dinner, I was stuffed but couldn't pass on dessert
*Normally I don't like key lime pie or anything too sour
*This is small in size (which was much appreciated since I was about to burst)
*This wasn't too sour and it was well balanced with the fresh whipped cream on top
*Refreshing after all the mexican food and it was a nice way to end the meal

Summary: I really enjoyed my meal at the Grand Electric. I had doubts going in but yes, it is worth all the hype. Tacos are a must order and expect everything to be super fresh. Make sure to go early (before they open) if you don't want to wait long. I would go back to this place anytime."}
{"text":"I finally got into this place without the line-up! The secret is showing up before 6pm on a weekday night. The hip hop blasting was great because you can bob your head along while chomping down on tiny tacos. 

My fav was the beef cheek which wasn't on the menu the last time I went. The baja fish taco was also good because the fried fish is balanced by the fresh beets/radish (I think that's what it was) which has a cooling crunchy effect.

The bourbonade is stronger than it looks. And if you're into the bourbon, there's an entire wall showcasing a variety of selections. I'd stick to the tacos though since I wasn't too into the sides. The pineapple dessert is \"dope\" according to the chalk board menu, but I'll have to try it next time. Those tiny tacos are surprisingly filling and will add up on your bill. Remember, cash only!

The bathroom is a 1ft x 1 ft stink hole that you have to fall down a set of narrow stairs to get to. Avoid."}
{"text":"One of my friend and my go-to places!!!
I love this place especially in the summer when you can sit on the patio drinking mojitos with some tacos...

I've tried most of their tacos and though I am not a huge fan of fish, I love love love the baja fish taco. My friend loves the beef cheek (which comes in a close second for me). We tried the scrapple once and it was okay...  We enjoyed the pork belly but we haven't seen it on the menu in a while. We have also tried the buffalo taco (it was a daily special taco) and it was pretty good but we haven't seen that back on the menu as well.

As for appetizers, I am a huge fan of guac so I usually order the guac and chips which isn't bad... The guac is pretty good but the chips are pretty salty. I've also tried the squid ceviche which I will probably never order again because it was too salty for my liking.

Overall, I love the feel of the restaurant... Very fun and lively. I definitely recommend going in the summer and sitting outside! There is usually a long wait to be seated and your whole party has to be there so I recommend going early!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing gastropub (more for the food IMHO). Their fusion Mexican food is out of this world! The chef always keeps things fresh so their menu items are often changing, and I've never been disappointed... yet :) They're always busy though, so if you go in the evening (yes, even on weeknights), expect to wait a while."}
{"text":"What what!!! having had baja fish tacos in Los Cabos I can testify (preach it brother) that these are uber tasty. Went here with my wife and brother and we waited for 1 hour which was ok as the RHINO is right down the street and offers cheap drinks. The atmosphere is ok. Kinda crowded but ok. They bumped 90's hip hop which was cool. The bourbon selection alone is worthy of coming in. I will be coming back and I recommend this to anyone who has a fish taco craving."}
{"text":"Meh- I guess the hype over Grand Electric has fizzled. 

Walked in on a Saturday night and the resto was half empty. After a recent trip to NYC and having tried life altering taco goodness, I was hoping GE would deliver the Toronto equivalent.

As everyone has said- the music is loud! Perhaps great for a first date- if it isn't going great you've got the music to end any and all conversations- just eat. I did enjoy the rap music.

Food- I tried one of each taco- disappointments: PORK TINGA- dry, lacked flavour
BAJA FISH- toppings galore, fish tasted like it was previously frozen- had high hopes ...didn't like this one; SPICY CHICKEN- not enough heat, dry

Tacos I enjoyed: BEEF SHOULDER- moist, served with avocado, green onion, shaved jalapeño
CRISPY CAULIFLOWER- great spices on the cauliflower with a crispy/crunchy texture

Every day of the week- $4 bourbon shots 

Not a fan of Bourbon so I tried their other offerings
El CHILI VERDE- great flavour with a slight kick (Serrano peppers)
JESUS JUICE- I would liken this to cough medicine...don't get this unless your trying to get over a cold

Service-  mediocre, felt rushed with dessert offered as we were finishing our last bite. Ordered another drink as my friend and I were not ready to go being there well under an hour.

On to the next taco joint!"}
{"text":"Maybe if I didn't feel like I had hearing loss from the weirdly loud music BLASTING at noon, or the server who slammed our food down and sauntered off, or maybe if the tacos hadn't been so teeny tiny for the price I would've given it three or more because the fish tacos and guac were both pretty yummy. 

I won't be patronizing a restaurant that is known for blasting music so loud people can't talk to their dining companions. Ooohhhh it's *so* hip to have a headache and ringing ears for the rest of the day. Pass."}
{"text":"Almost everyone who's been to Grand Electric has given great reviews, which isn't the least bit surprising to me especially after my visit! Upon my sister's imploring, we ventured into Parkdale on a somewhat pleasant Sunday evening. Secretly I too wanted to check out what the hullabaloo was all about. 

I went prepared to wait for about an hour in line. Luckily enough when we got there, they told us it would take us 30-45 mins. The hostess was even honest and nice enough to mention that it was leaning towards the 45 minutes side, which I thought was considerate of her. 

After walking around Parkdale and getting more than my fair share of window shopping ...It was finally our turn to be seated (and she was spot on about the waiting time). 

Upon being seated, we were greeted by pleasant staff members who explained to us their F & B menus and left us to think over our choices.

We ordered the guac + chips and spicy squid to start with and ordered multiple rounds of baja fish (the best taco I have had in Toronto), beef cheek (delish but a little dry), spicy chicken tacos. We also ordered the Miami Ribs, thin marinated strips of beef/veal cooked to perfection  and some Green Chorizo Hot dogs which was great as well. 

But what stood out the most was my Beef Crudo Tostado...I loved the flavor and tender texture of the meat  (although I did need a palette cleanser towards the end of night ) . 

Did I mention how delish the Baja Fish Taco was....When it arrived I imagined it would taste heavy and rich in fried goodness! Much to my surprise, it tasted like a CLOUD...yup, thats the only way I could describe it!

All in all a great gastronomic experience...the different flavors really get your senses tingling!"}
{"text":"I love this place !! Aside from the fact that it's really tiny and usually rammed during lunch and dinner the food is top notch. 

I've tried their nachos, ceviche, spicy squid, and almost every taco on the menu. As well as their deserts and every item has a separate and distinct taste. I would highly recommend this place. 

Not ideal for large groups."}
{"text":"Always fresh ingredients, tacos are incredible. The only thing I would improve is the noise level. Great music, but hard to have a conversation."}
{"text":"The lines are long, the waits can be unbearable but if you can get a seat in this place you'll definitely be happy that you did.

We sat down and the place looks like one of the bars on Queen St but you'll soon realize that it's got a great kitchen and the staff, at least the one we had, was fantastic, had personality and was a lot of fun to be around.

We ordered all the regular tacos on the menu as well as a special pork one.  We got a plate of nachos and spicy squid.

All the tacos were good but the beef cheek, fish tacos, spicy chicken and I'm not sure which one of the pork ones really stood out.  The beef was my favourite and had so much flavour.  The fish tacos were excellent and I said that if they served an order of fish and chips like that, I would consider it one of the better fish and chips in town!  The nachos you can skip.  They're ok but nothing special.  The spicy squid was extremely tender!

They also serve Mexican Coke and Mexican Fanta!  You get none of that crap corn syrup, rather cane sugar.

The atmosphere was fun, the food was good, and the service was excellent and very fast.  These are by far the best tacos I've had in Canada.

The food 4.5 stars and service was 5."}
{"text":"Went at 7:00 pm and only had to wait 15 minutes for a table for 2. When we got out around 8:00pm or so, there was a huge line-up and tons of people waiting for hours. We sat at the patio/outdoor bar where we could watch the bartender make drinks. Great vibe and easy-going servers. We're thankful that we sat outdoors, though, because indoors was way too loud to have a conversation (which is fine, you should only be eating there - the food is too good to have conversation). We ordered one taco of each of the following fillings: Pork belly, baja fish, spicy arbol chicken, beef cheek, corn supreme, scrapple, miami ribs, chorizo fundido, and washed it down with Anchor Steam and Rigor Mortis. Superb.

FELT SO HIP THERE"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos! Great atmosphere, although near impossible to talk/hear anyone over the loud music + rush of people in the tiny space, but delicious food. Always packed at night, have gone there at lunch as well and there's generally more space available."}
{"text":"This was one of the most underwhelming experiences I've had in a long time. Grand Electric was once a pinnacle in the community. Now it's just disappointing undercooked flavourless tacos with horrendous service. The staff completely ignore you without even bothering to ask how your drink, meal, or evening. And you have beg to get any sort of attention. It's appalling and honestly just disappointing to be treated in such a manner. The only thing they did well is hand you your bill and then kick you to the door by mentioning the waitlist. So thrilled my business was worthwhile!"}
{"text":"This place is a good spot for a late night snack and drinks.

I enjoyed the tacos that were actually real tacos and not gringos ones. It reminded me of the food I was eating when I was living in Mexico; which is great because there is so many Mexican restaurants out there and most of them don't have the authentic taste of Mexico!

The service was incredibly fast and efficient. I don't even know how they managed to prepare my ginger mojito in under a minute while there was other people in the bar...! Same goes with the tacos which we had received in under 5 minutes.

The staff was also very friendly and cool. Cheers!"}
{"text":"A lot of fun, edgy street club energy, not a place for Mom.

The taco offerings are okay, some are a little bland. The ceviche was fantastic. The chips and guacamole was kind of pointless, like they are just offered each time to round out the bill. Drinks were fine. Desserts were surprisingly good.

Service, don't expect much, it's hurry up and wait style. But try this place out."}
{"text":"We went here last night for Valentines Day and there were 16 items on the menu for the day. My boyfriend and I have 11/16. We wanted to try them all but couldn't fit a bite more.

Lets start with the tacos. There were 6 flavors: Chicken, fish, beef cheek, pork belly, scrapple, and cauliflower. So they were all bursting with flavour and I had to keep taking small bites out of each one to really try and decide which one was my favourite. I loved the pork belly one because of its tender meat and very delicious sauce. Then I would say the spicy chicken, then the beef cheek, then the fish (reminded me of fish n chip style but with a fine dining twist), then the scrapple (had sort of a bouncy texture to it, kind of hard to describe almost tasted like bone marrow...), then the cauliflower, which was still amazing! but I prefer my meats over my veggies.

We started with the guacamole and chips. This was the only thing that was really meh to me. Literally just baked chips with a bowl of guac and salsa. Cant really say it was REALLY good or REALLY bad... but anyways aftert we tried the Dr Octopus which was also wonderful. Not chewy as I had expected at all. Came with a very Thai like flavour, with corriander and that familiar tangy taste. We also had the fundido. Warning...our server did warn us...this is a heavy dish. Tons of cheese layererd with cheese and more types of cheese with hickory sticks to top it off. Maybe we would have enjoyed it more had we started with this, but to finish off with it was a no-no. Its kind of like a big cheesy dip. Mightve helped spice up the bland quac and salsa combo instead, to use it as a chip dip.

Next were the desserts. I really wanted to try the churros but was told they discontinued that for a while until they could get a separate fryer. So we had the hell cake and key lime pie. It was really cute, they came in little mason jars. For $5 each, they were exactly what was expected. I wasnt a huge fan of the hell cake, dont really like raisins much in desserts especially paired with cake. The key lime was a lot more in my favor. Liked the extra sour taste with the cookie crumble at the bottom. Not too much creme so it was the perfect balance in a little dessert cup.

Overall except for the fundido and guacamole appetizer, I still give this place 5 stars just because their tacos are beyond amazing. Next time I go I would order 2 of each :)"}
{"text":"***3.5 stars***

Finally after their grand opening in 2013 & the line-ups dwindled down, I was able to head over to Grand Electric with a friend a few weeks back.  Located on the Queen West, just west of Dufferin, Grand Electric adds an extra pop to the Queen West strip.

When you arrive, you will be seated only when your whole party has arrived.  The  restaurant has a cool, hipster vibe.  Due to a packed house, my friend and I were seated at the bar.  We ordered tacos - I highly recommend the fish and cauliflower (I was feeling non-meaty that night).  The tacos were smallish; they recommend 3 tacos if you are aiming for meal.

Their drink menu is neat; you have a selection of bourbon at your disposal.  I forget the name of my drink that I ordered, it was sour yet lovely.

Service was very quick.  After we ordered our food, it came out about 5-7 minutes later.  I felt a bit rushed after our meal arrived, I got the sense they wanted our seats after we done eating because of the line-up at the door.

Overall, I rate Grand Electric was a 3.5; I liked the vibe but disliked the rushed feeling when I dine out.  The food was descent but I will have to come back and try their other menu options.

If you are in the area and looking for a fun place to have dinner, make Grand Electric your choice."}
{"text":"These aren't traditional tacos so let's just start by removing the scoop of carne asada, shredded lettuce, pico de gallo idea from your head.  All gone?  Good.  

OK, let's get down to it.  Now we can talk about the creative magnificence that is the Grand Electric taco.  

It's a perfectly balanced dish delivered on a small flour tortilla.  I tried the chips and guac (tasty, fresh), the beef cheek taco (tender), and the fish taco (fried but not greasy). 

Summary: The food is tasty.  The place is noisy.  The wait to get in is really long."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant, but I don't think it fully lives up to the hype. It's so overcrowded all the time so I recommend going on a Sunday afternoon. The tacos are pretty good - not the best but they are pretty tasty. The service leaves something to be desired. They seem to rush too much (for instance the coffee I ordered was served in a to-go cup...like they didn't expect me to have enough time to drink it). I get that in a way because it's normally rammed with people, but I definitely would prefer less pressure. Overall it's a decent place, I liked the food, but you won't catch me waiting in a 2-hour line on a Friday night just to get a seat at the bar."}
{"text":"Been dying to try this place for ages and finally got around to coming here Sat eve. I knew they didn't take reservations and had heard about the crazy wait times so we came here at 5pm hoping to get in before the dinner rush. We got seats no problem but that could possibly have been because of the on & off rain. We sat at the bar on the patio where we were covered from the rain and eventually we had the whole patio to ourselves (for 2 people, the seats at the bar on the patio are the best - the rest of the seating outside is shared picnic tables). The bar tender was also our server and he was really friendly without being overbearing. We each had 3 tacos each and I think that would be enough for most people unless you're super hungry. We had the baja fish, the pork belly and the spicy chicken. I was excited to try the baja fish after hearing such rave reviews and I have to say it didn't blow either of us away. The pork belly was the same. The spicy chicken was our favourite - really spicy & flavourful! To be honest, we both agreed that we prefer the tacos at El Catrin. What really did it for us was the cocktails! We had a few different cocktails and they were all amazing! Totally unique and really packed a punch! The cocktails we had included the margarita, the bourbonade, the paloma, the G.E. sour, the el chili verde and Rosemary's Baby (from the specials menu and my favourite of all of them!). Not cheap but worth it! Would definitely come here again for the cocktails and the general vibe."}
{"text":"This place is over-rated.  I tried the baja fish taco on the basis of the reviews on yelp.  IMO, they were no big deal and kind of heavy.   The chips are served hot and fresh - so that was good.   The sauces on the table were very good. I also had  the fried squid hoagie and it was pathetic.  Hardly any squid.  My friend got the beef cheek taco and the pork sandwich and he liked it and it looked pretty good to me.  IMO, the meat is where it's at, at this restaurant.  An assortment of alcoholic drinks.  Music is very good.  Loud place.   On the west side of downtown so it was trek for me.  The interior was low-scale.  Their pricing didn't make sense to me.  It was pricey for what I got."}
{"text":"¡Yo quiero Grand Electric tacos!

If Grand Electric had a mascot, it would be a chihuahua with a toque, hipster plaid shirt, holding a taco, and a bottle of bourbon.

This place is all the hype... and worth the wait!
We arrived 20 minutes after opening and the place was already packed.
We added our name to the waiting list and hit up Boreal gelato while we waited for 45 minutes.

They called us and we made our way back to share a table.

This place is small, dark, noisy, a frenzy of people, but charming.
We selected 3 tacos each and split 3 appetizers scrawled on the blackboard menu at the back.

$3 dollars a taco.  A small price to pay for such awesome tacos!

The basa fish taco was my favourite.
The fish was melt in your mouth tender. Cilantro, lime, spices, wonderful textures.

The beef cheek was sweet and saucy, soft and juicy.

Pork belly was good with an oily red sauce.   It was alright, I secretly wish it was fattier.  

As for appetizers, the guac stole the show!
The guacamole and chips were surprisingly addictive for such a simple dish.
Fresh avocado and salsa, hot and oily chips. We ate every last bit.

The squid rings were a bit too soft and smothered in a red sauce.  They weren't spicy at all and I guess the rings are from little squid babies because they were pretty small.  

Ceviche on the menu... what a pleasant surprise!  I just got back from Peru and I've been eating a lot of ceviche.  The fish was fresh and super tart from marinating in lime juice.  Served up with onions and spices, it was refreshing but usually a lunch item rather than a dinner item.

Also, drinks are fabulous.  I had the house special \"Grand Electric\" bourbon sour.
It was more sweet and slightly sour with a delicious thick foam.  Incredibly easy to drink and enjoy!

Grand Electric is my first review of 2012!
What a great start to my foodalicious year! =)"}
{"text":"This is great to bring someone you don't want to talk to. The music is so loud, and obnoxious it basically makes you want to eat as fast as you can. It's too bad because the food is great but I wouldn't go back solely based on the music (and I'm not one to complain about this sort of thing)."}
{"text":"Maybe I had my expectations set a bit too high, after seeing a solid four to five stars on Yelp and hearing that the lineup to this place starts at 5:30pm every night of the week, but I thought Grand Electric was just okay, at least on the food front.  As a bar though, I wish I lived closer so I could come drink here every night.

Starting with the stuff I loved and think make Grand Electric super unique and awesome:
the music - old school hip hop beats, on the harder side no less...no one ever plays that stuff in bars so props!!
the patio - we can sit out there in winter with heaters on?? sweet!!
the extensive beer and bourbon menus - 'nuff said.

But food-wise, I thought the dishes we had were just ok.  We ordered several items including a bunch of the popular items the server recommended, which were guac and chips, fish tacos, and miami ribs.  The guac and chips were really good, but I can't say they were the best I've ever had.  The miami ribs were good but a bit too sweet, and I didn't like how the fish in the fish tacos was one big chunk. And I am a fan of authentic Mexican-style tacos, so I was a bit disappointed.

The kicker was that I ordered their drink special, some bourbon and cinnamon cocktail, and I didn't like it at all, which almost never happens with me and alcohol. I know it's a matter of personal taste, but coupled with the food, I couldn't say this place met my (high) expectations.  I wish I had a better experience, or maybe I just had to order different stuff, because as a bar, I think Grand Electric is a great one to drink at, just on the atmosphere alone."}
{"text":"Electric Mud BBQ closed on me prematurely so I detoured here, while on my way to Porzia.

This is a hipster jawn.  Small, dark, limited menu, lots of booze, unheard of music, cash only; all the hipster restaurant attributes.  Their Baja Fish tacos is pretty good.  Beef cheek, spicy chicken, scrabble tacos weren't bad, but weren't inspirational also.  Maybe I got spoiled by La Carnitas.  I had their charred tuna salad as well.  I could do without it.

Their coconut cream was pretty good.  It's made me fall in love with meringue again.

It's a great place for drinks and mingle.  It is very unlikely for me to go back.  However, you should try it once.

The End."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The waitress really seemed as though she didn't give a shit & wasn't interested in the customers. We were there for a short while and we watched her ignore and/or be rude to other customers. She basically threw our food at us and walked away to giggle in the corner with the other staff."}
{"text":"The restaurant opens at 6pm, so friends and I jumped in a cab after work to make the line for 5:45. I knew there were only about 35 seats, and there were already 30 people in line. We were the last table to be seated. Everyone else had to put their names on a waiting list...suckers!
I guess if we didn't get a table, my rating would be lower, so I understand why some people only gave this place 3 stars. Other than the hassle to get there, everything else was amazing! The spicy squid was suprisingly delicious - definately will go back for that alone! (I think I should also wear skinny coloured jeans and dark rimmed glasses to blend in with the other parkdale hipsters...)
Portions=large
Music=aweome
atmosphere=loud
Will for sure go back."}
{"text":"With all the reviews I was expecting something amazing... the food was nothing special... had the beef cheek which was cold. The Baja fish nothing special and the chicken which didn't have any taste. I wanted something amazing.."}
{"text":"Grand Electric is very high on my list of taquerias in the GTA; right up there with Seven Lives and La Carnita.
We have been here thrice and have always left very happy/satisfied.
My favorites here are Cauliflower taco, Shrimp taco and Baja fish taco. Yes, you read it right a vegetarian taco can taste amazing as well. 

If you don't believe me - put on a toque, brave the weather and get over there. 
Even if you do believe me - put on a toque, brave the weather and get over there."}
{"text":"The baja fish taco is one of the best! Most of their apps are delicious, including the ever loved corn on the cob, when they have it in the summer. Great atmosphere and service and I love sitting on their patio as well!"}
{"text":"Well, it's pretty obvious this place gets the popular vote. For good reason.

Don't be disgruntled by the wait, with the patio's opening, you'll get seated in good time. Better yet, tell the hostess you're okay with a communal table - it's too loud to hear your neighbours anyways.

We sat at a resurfaced and reclaimed wooden picnic table. Drink, Food, and Bourbon menus all on chalkboard wall paint surrounding us. Strung lightbulbs, scattered bar shelving ... it looks inspired by a Mexican family gathering, very hipster, very trendy. 

For the liver, we tried all three cocktails their menu. Our favourite was the Grand Electric Sour (frothy due to egg white addition). Our stomachs enjoyed the Baja Fish Tacos (over and over and over). Will definitely be returning with anyone who will accompany me ... or alone, don't judge me."}
{"text":"Used to give this place 5 stars 3 years ago, but as of recently they have really gotten cheap! Such a shame. The guac serving is embarrassingly small, you will be left with half of your nacho chips before you finish the guac. This might be happening now because your server will ask you if you'd like more guac once you're done! (At an extra cost of course-something they never did before) I know it wasn't only our order because the tables next to us sat down and opted out of guac because of the portions sizes lol. Prices have gone up and food choices and quality isn't that much better. Service and atmosphere is the only thing that earned them 2 stars."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Wait was an hour and 15 min.  One thing I didn't like about this place is LOUD music!!!!  Wish it was a tiny bit quieter."}
{"text":"Very good but not AH-MAZING. 

Definitely not worth anything over 1 hour wait... Though I didn't have to wait at all. 
Tried the bourbon sour cocktail as per reviews... Very tasty!

Our fave dishes (all packed a punch in flavour):
Pig head crudo (it was a special) with beets - delish!
Spicy squid highly recommended
Beef cheek tacos
Baja tacos

Guac - fresh quality ingredients but lacking a kick or oomph
The beef ribs were ok - a lil on the sweet side
Pork and chicken tacos were ok, nothing special
Key lime pie for dessert was a nice light portion, but also nothing spectacular

Not dying to come back or drag all my friends here but overall a good meal
I prefer Playa Cabana for awesome fish/octopus tacos, mojitos, and buckets of shrimp.

That is all!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for some excellent tacos, Grand Electric should be #1 on your list. I came here with a bunch of friends for a Mexican cuisine project. We ordered one of each taco and the pig face fries. I came right when it opened (11:30am).

Unlike some other taco places, every single taco here is exciting and flavorful. The pig face fries... wow. 3 was enough because it was so filling and delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food, the ambiance is amazing ... but having to read the menu on a wall that is way too far and dark it is kinda stupid."}
{"text":"FatCat not like feeling sting of scornful waitress at Grand Electric, but FatCat take abuse if he get good food. And food at GE very good!!

Things FatCat like
 - Delicious food at good price (recommend the spicy squid)
 - Waitress #2 - Help FatCat score points with date by getting good seat
 - Hipster waiter explaining menu.. very friendly and helpful

Things FatCat not like
 - Waitress #1 - Not let FatCat sit at good seat even though good seat available
 - Watiress #3 - Very cold and bitter. FatCat think waitress#3 was out-of-work American Apparel model who not get modeling jobs anymore after she turn 14 - get too old for AA - and have to now waitress at GE to pay for Vespa and overpriced condo in liberty village.
 - Music too loud - FatCat not hear sweet voice of classy lady who try to get to know FatCat better on date."}
{"text":"Great bourbon list and excellent cocktails, delicious tacos, some homemade hot sauces (and your typical faves), great vibe, casual service, and to reiterate: delicious tacos. Have been here now a number of times and it is consistently good. Sometimes tough to get in, and it can be loud, especially in the evenings, but it is overall terrific."}
{"text":"I have been to Grand Electric a couple times and the Tacos are always good with super soft tender shells that are SO GOOD. But the actual fillings, while good, have never blown me away. The margaritas are good too, with sugar and salt on the rim instead of just salt. Service is fine if a little rushed because they're always so busy. The patio itself is nice but the communal tables can feel a little awkward depending on who you're dining with. I guess I just wish this place was a little better, the tacos a little more flavourful, the margaritas a little stronger and saltier, and the service a little friendlier and less hurried and then this spot would be really amazing to justify the chronically long wait time to be seated."}
{"text":"by far the best taco's I've had to date. we waited for about 30 minutes to be seated because we wanted our own table. however there were many communal tables there. the service was amazing. I really liked how intimate the setting was, how their menu (both bar and food) was on chalkboards on the walls. the service was excellent, I have not been this happy with my food and service in a while. although the tables are slightly small, it was good enough to be comfortable. 

will definitely return here again, as well recommend it! 

we had the baja fish tacos, the pulled pork, spicy chicken and cauliflower ones. the baha was definitely my favourite,
followed by the pulled pork."}
{"text":"Definitely the tastiest tacos I've had in Toronto. Especially nice as a vegetarian to have a few options. The cauliflower taco was really tasty because it is perfectly battered and has a nice kick and spice to it. The guacamole was good but go for the tacos. Service was nice, friendly and fast. Good options for beer on tap. One piece of advice is to go early in the day or be ready to wait.  We were there for lunch when the restaurant opened at noon and it was full by 12:10."}
{"text":"After many attempts to come here, only to turn away after hearing the currently wait times of 1.5 to 2.5 hours, I finally made it in.  We came here on a weekday night at 830, but still had to wait 30 minutes for a table for 2 and got a spot at the counter.

The prices were pretty decent and the food service was quick.   I loved the Tuna ceviche, the Tuna was tasty and tender with the mixix of citrus on top that really amp the dish well.  We tried every taco on the menu, the ones that really stood out were the Beef shoulder and the Baja fish.  The tacos aren't that big, so I would say a guy could eat at least 4 tacos and a Tuna ceviche easily on his own.

Overall, the food is definitely great, definitely worth a try...but it is also definitely NOT worth a 2 hour wait.   I would recommend trying the little known take out/delivery option instead.  The dine in experience is nothing special that demands to be had.  The food is the star of this place, so save yourself some time (ok a lot of time) and still enjoy the enjoy the food delights of Grand Electric without the hassle."}
{"text":"This was the second and last time I will ever eat here. I still can't understand the hype around this place when there are so many better and cheaper taco places in this city. I wasn't blown away the first time I was there either, but was convinced to try it again. My SO can't tolerate super spicy food so we made sure to ask one of the 3 servers we had what was the least spicy. He listed the 3 most spicy tacos, but when we asked another server the same question later, they said that one of those we were warned about earlier wasn't that spicy, so no one that works there really knows what they're talking about and everyone has a very rude/impatient attitude to them. We ordered the chips and dip, side of chicharron, tuna ceviche, beef cheek taco, shrimp taco, crispy cauliflower taco and fish taco. Pretty much everything is fried, all the tacos are buried in a mountain of cilantro and raw onion so you'll be tasting everything for hours afterwards. Everything in way too spicy for some reason, even before you sample the several hot sauces that are on the table. Most Mexican places make their food somewhat mild so they can showcase their hot sauces, but that's not the case here. In terms of the taste of the tacos, there wasn't much that really stood out. The crispy cauliflower had fresh mint in addition to the pile of cilantro, which did not go well at all. The chicharron at Electric Mud are way better too, as the ones we had were chewy and bland. In the end the best thing the 4 of had was the ceviche, as all the tacos except for the beef cheek tasted the same because everything was fried and buried under the same pile of cilantro/onion. Our part of the bill was over $40 and we still left hungry. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"A bit pricey but the food is good. Be patient since getting a table can take a while. We loved the ambience and service."}
{"text":"Grand Electric is one of those places that I want to love, but can't due to the pretentious hipster service that seems all to common in Toronto.
 
Food
This is the reason I would go back. The food is consistent and usually on point when it comes to flavours. My personal favourites have been the baja fish and beef cheek tacos, although the crispy cauliflower looked quite good last time I went. I would say 3 tacos is a good portion for a typical meal, 2 if you aren't super hungry (or saving room for dessert). Granted, since these are tacos you can easily keep ordering more without much hassle or inconvenience to your fellow diners. I did try the key lime pie on one occasion, and yes it is adorable in it's mason jar vessel, but it wasn't anything special and a tad too sweet for my liking.

Drinks 
I'd stick to brewskis as the cocktails here seem so-so. If I had to describe the Paloma it'd say it tasted like diluted tequila water. My friends mojitos and margaritas faired better but again lacked balance. This isn't a big deal in my opinion since beers go better with tacos anyways.

Service
This is the part I can't seem to understand about Grand Electric... it seems like they hire the most aloof, uninterested people to be servers. I understand it's a taco joint, not a Ritz-Carlton, but would it kill to show a little enthusiasm? On both occasions I've gone the service seemed slow and you'd have to wave down your server if you needed anything. 

Atmosphere
Depending on what time of day you go, you are in for a very different experience. During the day and early evening, the space is quite airy and the backyard patio (which is covered) is a great spot to catch up with a group of friends. Once night time comes, this place seems to turn down the lights and blast heavy hip hop music. If you were planning to stare romantically into your partners eyes or engage in deep conversation, it'd suggest going elsewhere. Regardless though the menu is much easier to read on the patio - inside it's virtually impossible as it's on chalkboards (the worst!)"}
{"text":"Right in the midst of hipster central is one of the best taco places in the city. It's not a very big place, even with the patio out back, so be sure to grab a spot early because they don't take reservations. Like most taco places, you get a tapa sized taco for $4-7 depending on how specialized you want it.  I tried the beef cheek, pork belly, and fish taco.  Each were delicious, well presented with the \"right\" amount of topping, so that you don't make too big a mess when eating. They were also each a bit spicy, so watch out if you're stomach isn't up to the challenge. The price is on par with other taco places and food quality is great. Would definitely recommend and come back... As long as the wait isn't crazy long."}
{"text":"My favourite tacos in the city! Also, my favourite chips and guacamole in the city. I usually get the beef and chicken tacos. They are amazing. I also really love the homemade hot sauce."}
{"text":"Walking in here my first thought was Tacombi Nolita. I don't know why. Tacombi is spacious, Grand Electric is tight. There's an air of hipster-mexican in the air that connects the two. It was so crowded, no room in the backyard patio and just barely two seats at the end of the bar. The tacos were okay. They didn't jump up at this West Coaster, but maybe for Toronto it's pretty good. Drinks were similarly satisfactory but there was a lot of top shelf bourbon on display which we didn't quite break into during my visit."}
{"text":"Good taco's! That is the only reason why people come here right;)? There are two things I don't like about this place. It's WAY to loud. Socializing is quite difficult. Second, the menu is on a chalk board which is hard to see depending where you're sitting and may involve in getting up to read it."}
{"text":"Tacos and guacamole are excellent! Loved Pineapple express and key lime dessert. Wish it opened earlier than 5:30. 

One bad thing: waitress pushing us to pay bill while we were still eating dessert. Not. Cool. Still gave 15% tip tho cuz the meal was great."}
{"text":"Baja fish tacos are to die for!!!! Great atmosphere, friendly staff! Pink lemon is a must try! So good!"}
{"text":"I love tacos. A lot. And if I was reviewing just the tacos here It for sure would be allll the stars. Don't get me wrong I didn't have a terrible experience here, but I didn't feel like GE lived up to the hype that surrounds it. We had three servers throughout the night and they just seemed like they didn't want to be there. It wasn't even really that busy so I'm not sure what was up? Bad vibes! 

Again, I want to just rate the food because I know that everyone has bad days, I want to give them the benefit of the doubt.  I got the fish taco and the chicken one and they both were really good. I wish I got more honestly! For the food for sure a 4-5 star rating.

I'll probably be back though! not much more to Taco' bout."}
{"text":"I was told about this place by a guy I work with who mentioned that it was a pretty good option for tacos.

I walk here from Spadina on a warm afternoon. Soon after arriving I realized that I had unreasonably high expectations based on the information I had about this place from yelp and the guy I work with.

It is my position that the Grand Electric is inauthentic in what it is trying to achieve. Therefore it may sometimes provide a passably good experience but, will like any posser, on close inspection fail to deliver on its promise.  

I had the fish taco and Jesus Juice.

The taco failed to impress me. 

I did not want onions on my taco but was told that I had to have onions as no substitutions are allowed. I can appreciate the policy of no substitutions if the food I am ordering is a complex gourmet meal with many steps required in its preparation prior to me placing the order. A taco is not such food. Most food trucks would thus outperform the Grand Electric in this regard. 

Jesus Juice was a mediocre cocktail. 

For some reason the bartender would occasionally stick his tongue out of his mouth and bit down on it for no apparent reason. A bit bizarre!

I found the service a bit passive aggressive and generally uninterested in creating a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"Love the tacos here especially the Baja Fish taco.  The taco at Grand Electric is super small but amazing in taste.  At $3.60 a taco the bill can add up quickly as you can eat from 5-8 taco easily. Also got the spicy chicken and beef cheeks which were also tasty.

The place is tiny with some unique decor and super loud music which can be hard to have a conversation at times.  Service was great as servers kept checking up on us.

{"text":"After driving by GE many times and seeing how popular it is, now I know why. It's an inviting little spot to drop in for a bite and a drink and you can have both for just a few dollars. A nice selection of hot sauces at the bar make you want to order a taco and the fish taco I had was excellent! The bourbon special of the day went well and I felt a wash of comfort come over me with the music, food and drinks. Great service along with communal seating make it easy to squish in with your friends. A clear view of the action in Parkdale along Queen St. top off the chemistry that makes for a leader in the pack in the sea of great drinking spots in WQWest."}
{"text":"Grand Electric offers delicious authentic Spanish cuisine to starving hipsters in Parkdale.  This joint is bumping! The space itself is cozy, dimly light and has few tables.  The food is delightful and reasonably priced.  The menu offers a variety of classic Spanish dishes.  We started with the guac and followed with individual tacos-beef cheek, fish, chicken, and cheese.  I had the tripe soup and it was amazing!!!! I have been in twice and they have been playing excellent hip hop both times which was refreshing.  Grand Electric is in very high demand these days. I popped in on a Friday night at 6:30pm to put my name down on the list (they do not take reservations) and the hostess informed me it would be a three and a half hour wait to get a table for 2! Puta madre!  If you intend to dine here be prepared to wait!  Or go in and put your name on the list and head over to the cadi lounge for a drink and they will call you when your table is available.  If you are the patient type then Grand Electric is the joint for you. If you are starving, better try somewhere else.  If you are privy enough to dine here than rejoice because it is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Wanted to give them a 3.5 but the bump up to 4 was for the excellent service. So lets get into it!

We got there at around 5:10, and yes there was already a group ahead of us. Thankfully the weather was gorgeous so waiting till 6 was fine. The line was building fast behind us so get there at 5 if possible!

The doors opened promptly at 6 and we took a seat on a patio. The picnic benches could fit probably 4 comfortably and we were a group of 3... then we were informed that since it's communal seating they could fit 6-8 people there! Sorry but that bench is not big enough! Luckily we only got 2 more and the squeeze wasn't that bad

Moving onto the food. We ordered one of everything. I had been waiting for months to try this place and I sure as hell wanted to see what all the hype was about. 

- The guac and chips were ok... I think I've had better guac from amateur cooks. 
- The tacos... meh... I personally thing La Carnita has a better taco with a better balance of flavours. It's not that the tacos were bad, they just weren't spectacular. 
- The table really liked the Tuna Ceviche - very fresh. The ribs were way too sweet for my liking and the Beef Crudo was not appetizing at all. Queso Fundido was delicious and the spicy squid was ok.. but not spicy (it is deep fried though.. so yum). We also got the two desserts: key lime and a chocolate with pecans. Both were good, the key lime needed to be more tart but still good overall.

I thought the service was spectacular. Our server  was nice, friendly and attentive. Yes this place gets super busy! It may take 15 mins for you to get a drink so don't come here if you are on a time crunch. For me, our server bumped this place up for me. 


Overall: Would I wait 2-3 hours for this place? No. Good food. Not great food!"}
{"text":"The tacos were awesome, but a little bit pricey. I loved beer over there."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. It is bit further away from core downtown area.

For Vegetarian there is not much to choose from. However hubby loved his spicy chicken tacos and kids had fish tacos.

We ate in the back patio area which was less loud than the  bar area at the front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I ordered a variety of tacos and I loved all of them. Their guacamole was good too, but not as extraordinary as their tacos. The only downside would be the long waiting time to get a seat and there are not many things there to do in the area while you wait for their call."}
{"text":"Went again the other night. Finally had the bourbon fizz. Delicious! Love the ambiance, but really, I love the food more. 

(Also: Yelp now as \"hipster\" as an ambiance option?!)"}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie. I've had 4 star and 5 star experiences here, but decided to go with the 5 star in the end because some of the food they kick out here is the best I have ever had, it is most certainly worth slaying. 

HISTORY/ABOUT: Located in Parkdale, it is the concoction of former Chef de cuisine and front of house manager from legendary Black Hoof - a highly praised offal oriented restaurant in Toronto. 

DÉCOR/AMBIENCE: A little cramped but a nice atmosphere. Can get loud so drink up and yell at your guests if need be. 

MENU DESIGN/READABILITY: written on a chalkboard above the bar, same with alcohol. You can virtually read it from anywhere in the restaurant. 

FOOD QUALITY: Phenomenal. Some of the best tacos you'll get in Toronto no question. They double up the soft tortillas too which is a good look. My favourite tacos in order: Beef cheeks, fish (typically baha), and pork tinga. If they have the miami ribs on special get them they are outrageous. The crispy brussel sprouts are also among some of the best items I have gotten here. Ceviches can be hit or miss, but overall very tasty and well executed (I'm a ceviche snob). On the table is salsa verde and a Mexican hot sauce which I believe is called Valentina, I put both on everything including intermittent squeezes of fresh lime wedges. In house guac is fresh and tasty I'd also recommend ordering the guac + chips to start. 

**check the pics for the Fried Squid and Peanut-Hoisin Rib special pics, they will have you sold!

BOOZE: Tons of Bourbon, tequila, beer, wine and cocktails. The house cocktail GE Sour is incredible: Vanilla bourbon, agave, egg whites, lemon. Unreal, I can crush through 5-6 without realizing it. 

PRICE POINT: Fair price point. I believe prices went up and now tacos are 3$ piece which is fair. Patrons often complain about food prices but they don't take into consideration where the ingredients are bought from, the time it takes to come to an end product (marinating, braising, labour). Come to think of it, 3$ is damn good. All around fair prices considering what you are getting. 

SERVICE: Good.

BATHROOMS: clean, average. 

FINAL THOUGHTS: a beautiful hip taqueria in Parkdale, well executed with such tasty food, what more could you want?

***wait on a Friday/Saturday eve can be up to 3 hours, go for lunch or be there 15-30 prior to when they open. 

***Now open for lunch 7 days a week from 11:30a-4:30p!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 10:00 pm on a Saturday night and waited 45 minutes but it was worth it. Great concept and good food and drinks. Servers and DJ were very friendly and welcoming. We ordered a few tacos each, spicy squid and a dessert. 

Taco recommendation: Beef cheek 
Drink recommendation: Margarita or Burbon-ade
Dessert recommendation: Coconut cream (the meringue was executed perfectly) 

Try this place out. It's hip. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I read that the other reviews complained about it being greasy, but I did not feel that way.

Having lived in Latin American (and on the Mexican border), this brought me back memories. Good memories.

We did get there at 6:00, and were told there was a 1.5 hour wait for 4 people, but we were seated before 7pm hit."}
{"text":"fiesta in your face

:Parkdale:

I heard.  I went. I loved.

Grand Electric has been busy.  I heard it was a two-hour wait.  It wasn't.  It was about 30 minutes.  (FYI: No reservations, but you can leave your name and number and the hostess will add you to her already burgeoning list.  Be patient or stay home.)

Last week I was craving me some Mexican - might have something to do with all those annoying Old El Paso commercials.  Anyway...I decided to do something about it so I asked Dream Team if they'd be interested in going with me after work on Thursday.  It opens at 6 (six nights a week; closed Tuesdays) so we figured we'd get there before and wait.  Of course Dream Team said yes.  And before anyone starts in on me about how Mexican food is better in Cali...we are in TORONTO.  This is top notch Mexican for Toronto.  And the service just makes it even more worthwhile.

Last Thursday Dream Team headed over and were in line by the time I arrived.  Doors opened at 6 and we were the fifth party seated.

Inside is a little cramped and a lot of chill.  That's the best way to describe it.  It's the kind of joint where you can walk in, get fed, drink up and go home...happy.  It's what I like to call a P-spot: Personal-Pleasant-Poppin' - as in the music.

There's a lot you can learn about GE if you care; who's behind it, what they're doing and why, etc.  I'm not here for that.  I'm only here for the food.  And the drinks.  GE has fantastic drinks, such as a bourbon sour with egg white foam and a kick of pepper. 

Their menu isn't extensive but it's got a great selection of really tasty Mexican fare, especially their tacos.  They take quality ingredients to prepare familiar, authentic flavours, but kick it up a knotch. 

Our favourites of the night were the beef crudo tostada - beef tartare, peanuts, mint and tuna ceviche: perfect zing, lots of zest, and lovely fish.  We also ordered the special - queso fundido (chorizo, cheese, egg) but didn't love it.

Tacos are $3.50 and worth EVERY penny, and a high 5.  Of the three we tried (pork belly and beef cheek), the BAJA FISH was our favourite.

Dinner ended on a sweet note - the key lime dessert was really good.  And the bill was even better.  All that food, for about $40 per person.

I really want you all to eat here, and not because it's \"hip\".  When I eat out, I want to enjoy the company with whom I'm eating. Enjoy the place I'm doing the eating. And of course, really love what I'm eating and after all is said and done, like the price I paid.  Anything else people say is just a whole lot of hoopla I don't remember.  I think one of GE's owners said it best. \"'We are restaurant workers. We're serving you food and getting you drunk.'\"  Oh, high 5 there buddy.  

So, for as long as GE keeps it real, there will be a lot of happy eaters.  I just wish it wasn't so far.  I also wish they'd open up a taco stand closer to the downtown core so that me and my lil' two feet could step on by and pick up, oh I don't know, perhaps ten?  Ya, ten  tacos sounds about right."}
{"text":"Delightful place, delicious food... I find a lot of portions really tiny at these boutique Mexican restaurants...really all hipster restaurants in the city, lol... but the portions here are actually quite large and surprising and I'm not complaining because I'd have an encore of the entire meal were I not full afterwards.  

I'm a pescatarian and an aFISHianado and everything seafood here is unreal good... their specials are also always fantastic / innovative and main menu worthy.

The nachos are a great sharing dish... unlike any other deconstructed chip dish I've had elsewhere.  Be warned: you will want to come back sooner and not later.  It's so damn addictive."}
{"text":"These tacos are awesome. A must try in the over saturated taco market in toronto. Wings were also tasty."}
{"text":"It was so so. It had a hipster vibe, and the decor was pretty interesting, I liked the theme. The drinks are $11 bucks for the most part. They have a shot of the day for $4. Their food is overpriced. I paid $7 for the chorizo quesadilla  and it was super small. Also, their payment system is really odd, they won't let you split the bill unless its an even number or something like that. The server was friendly though."}
{"text":"Good hang out place with friends. The fish tacos are to die for but be warned the chicken tacos are mega spicy! You can't make reservations here and it's small so going in the middle of the week or for lunch is best!"}
{"text":"Really fantastic. A kind friend stopped by on his way home from work to get on the list. Friday night, and we waited 1.5 hours from opening, despite being in line before the venue opened. Still, we went and had a drink, and headed back at a reasonable time.

Grand Electric bourbon sour to start. I found it a bit too sweet, but the vanilla was a lovely touch. 

Me and my two gentlemen friends ordered 3 tacos each, and split 3 apps. (The guacamole, the tuna cerviche, and the spicy squid.) The guacamole was great. Probably my favourite app. The tuna was lovely, and the spicy squid tasted like chicken wings. I love chicken wings, so that is a good thing (although a bit odd).

I ordered the pork belly taco, the chicken tinga, and the baja fish taco. Fantastic! The fish taco and the pork belly were my favourites. I only wish the server had taken the time to explain what was in each taco. They were just dropped off at the table with no explanation, and the board that we ordered off of didn't give any hints, so I can't tell you what was in what. Regardless, they were delicious.

The only snafu? We waited and waited for our last app to arrive. The servers came by twice to ask if we wanted more drinks. The first was so sweet that we didn't feel like another. Then started giving us the hairy eye, and pointing at us. Actually. (It's a really busy restaurant and I guess we were taking too long.) Finally once we realized that our third dish REALLY wasn't coming, and flagged someone down to ask for it. Turns out they had forgotten it. I  felt it could have been handled better.

Ordered both the lime and the chocolate pecan dessert to be split 3 ways. The key lime was definitely the winner. 

I would definitely go back.

3 tacos, 1 drink and my share of the apps and dessert plus tax and tip=$40
Reasonable."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food but the music sucks and is so incredibly loud. Too bad they have to compromise a quality experience in order to serve more customers."}
{"text":"As far as price, selection and freshness goes, Grand Electric nails it every time. I come here AT LEAST once a week and I'm not sick of this place yet. I always opt for the baja fish taco, or the shrimp. The portion for the fish taco is a really great size, and the sauce on the shrimp is sweet and spicy. Just recently, I ordered the chips and dip which came with salsa, guacamole and refried beans. I honestly, couldnt get enough of the beans, the guacamole is so fresh but i was slightly disappointed with the salsa as it was a bit watery than i'd like. The Michelada is a MUST order, honestly best cocktail i've ever had, its a caesar but better as its made with a Mexican Beer. Might I ass it's the perfect hangover cure. The restaurant is small inside, and the atmosphere is laid back. They play great music that isn't too loud that you can't have a conversation but can definitely vibe out. I've tried a few other places and Grand Electric has a huge place in my heart. Also, their selection of hot sauces is great, there's a green one that will have your nose running and you taste buds tingling."}
{"text":"I've renamed Sunday to Taco Sunday Funday. No, I'm not a weirdo, (well sort of but this isn't the reason), I have just found a new love in my life and  what better way to spend a Sunday than propped up at a bar eating tacos and drinking Bourbon Sours.

Maybe one of the best in the city, the bourbon sours you get at GE are so delicious... Not a bourbon fan? No problem. I also tried the Cesaers and they were equally as tasty.

Now for the food, I have now officially tried the Beef Cheek, The Fish and the Chicken tacos. I have also tried the Guacomole and chips and ceviche. All of which were pretty incredible. While the tacos might not be first date material, (they are uber sloppy), they are worth getting your hands dirty for. For dessert, I tried their Key Lime cup (they put all the goodness of key lime, into a jar with crumbs in the bottom.. Delish!

As for the joint itself, I always had these illusions that it was going to be big but it's small and cozy. No wonder there's usually a line up!"}
{"text":"3 Stars - Since I tried both La Carnita and Grand Electric a few days apart - I'm well prepared to contrast these competing taquerias.

Grand Electric is a very small restaurant with long wait times to get a table. They do not take reservations and are cash only. They play Hip Hop music which I felt was distracting. (Advantage - La Carnita).

Note: They have the deadliest trip to the washroom in history - 1) incredibly steep stairs, 2) winding stairs and 3) if your taller than 5.9 - you will bang your head. 
 
Service was nothing short of fantastic. Staff were incredibly friendly, helpful and genuinely interested in you having a great experience. (Advantage - Grand Electric).

Appetizers were average to good. The chips and Guac. were somewhat disappointing, very basic. The spicy octopus was much better with delicious toppings (good with the chips). The Tuna meat balls were also rather plain. (Advantage - La Carnita).

Tacos were rather small so I had the Chicken, Pork, Baha fish and Cauliflower tacos. Fish was fried and the Pork / chicken tacos had some kick. The standout was the cauliflower tacos - cooked softly but in a tempura batter with amazing complimentary toppings. (Advantage - Tie between Carnita & Grand Electric - neither are as good as Seven Lives in Kensington market).

Grand Electric had a number of interesting beers on tap and the servers understood the differences. Some interesting cocktails as well. (Advantage - Grand Electric).

I will be back to Grand Electric if in the area. I slightly prefer La Carnita relative to Grand Electric on the basis of the appetizers. As far as the tacos go - both disappoint relative to Seven Lives in Kensington market.

BK"}
{"text":"I would have loved to have written a review that included the taste of the actual food, but this unfortunately will be exclusively based on service as I was denied the honour to eat here.

The brilliant decision to deny me their food was simply because they refused to give me the tacos without raw onions on (every taco comes with them).  I was asked if it was an allergy (which it isn't), but i did warn them that it causes me to puke on their bar and to just leave them off.  However they said, and i quote: \"we don't make any substitutions of any kind\".  I wasn't asking for them to get one of their nubile servers to menstruate in a cup so they could make me a period-aioli for my beef cheek taco (which for the record should probably be a special here), I was only asking to leave off one of the ingredients.  Incompetent cookie-cutter COOKS refuse substitutions, real CHEFS thrive at opportunities to challenge their creative side and charge accordingly. 

You guys aren't purest from Italy protecting the culinary integrity of your region, you are a glorified Queen St. taco stand.  Just pull out the old mandolin, shave me some radish, dump on your shitty mayo, leave off the onions, and take my money = how business works!! 

Also there's a big sign that says \"no splitting bills\" (see the posted pic).  This is kinda crazy to me, i've worked in the service industry my whole life and its well founded that you always get a better tip when you allow bill-splitting because each person rounds up to the nearest logical denomination (as opposed to a group of 4 monolithically rounding up to one number).  I guess math is also an issue for these servers.  

I will say this however, the food looked good and for anyone going who doesn't have an aversion to onions, please drop off a GED book for the servers' down syndrome math skills, and a subscription to Forbes magazine for the owners' piss-poor business skills.  

If this place wants to be more authentically mexican I suggest working harder to make a buck!"}
{"text":"definitely overhyped. I lined up to try this and it was ok. 
The fish tacos were DELICIOUS but that was the only thing that was exceptional. Everything else was pretty mid level in terms of deliciousness."}
{"text":"Like others, I've tried to come here and have been told the wait would be over two hours.  We never bothered waiting.  Finally, we decided to come on a Sunday afternoon.  Thank goodness the wait was less than 20 minutes!  The food was good, but not mind-blowing good like five star worthy, good.  Everything was fresh.  Service was friendly and efficient.  I just don't think it's worth over a two hour wait."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is delicious... Fish Taco is my favorite. Great service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place today (well, not really; we knew it was there, but happened to be in the Parkdale area at the right time).

I had scrapple for my first time ever and on a taco no less! Great flavour and as others have mentioned, the sauce on this particular taco is excellent. We also shared the spicy cauliflower taco, baja fish taco, guac and chips, and the ceviche. Everything was very good.

Love the hip hop... not something you hear in a restaurant everyday.

I'd love to go back and drink there some day when I don't have to drive.

Hope to go back soon!"}
{"text":"Tacos, guac, tuna ceviche and more. Special menu items always change. These guys keep it fresh and relatively cheap. Not the best tacos I've ever had but best in Toronto. Love their house made green chilli sauce. Go early or during the day to miss the line up!  Fast friendly service. Parkdale staple."}
{"text":"Fun and lively place! Staff is very friendly and hospitable. Ordered fish, spicy yam and crispy cauliflower tacos - sooo good! Baja fish being the best then spicy yam followed by crispy cauliflower  .. You essentially cannot go wrong. I had to order seconds because it was so good! Glad I checked out this place!"}
{"text":"Don't advertise you're open and delivering on food delivery websites/apps and then cancel the order 30 minutes after it was placed. Unprofessional."}
{"text":"The first time I was at Grand Electric, they had just opened.  All of their tacos have cilantro on them.  I asked for no cilantro (it's the one and only food I won't eat).  They said, no modifications.  OK.  See you in six years or whatever when I decide to come back.

Like all places in Toronto that try the \"tough guy\" approach at first, and then realize it's not good business, (except Black Hoof, who shall remain bull-headed for all time), now when I was at Grand Electric they were more than \"happy\" to take off the cilantro.  Nice.  

I had a Caesar with no cilantro/no hot sauce, and it was SUPER yummy.  The salt rim was great - a TON of salt, just how I like it.  It was way worth the trek out west for this Caesar.  I wish it'd had a pickle, but, that's just me being picky.  

I got two tacos: the pork belly and the baja fish.  I love fish tacos, but this was just okay - too spicy with no acidity to cut down the spice.  The half a centimeter piece of lime I received did not cut it.  The pork belly was good, but again lacking an element of depth.

Space was cramped, service not so friendly but still (not that this is impressive) better than La Carnita.

I'd be back for a Caesar."}
{"text":"One of the best and elaborate taco menus that I've seen. The pork belly watermelon salad is amazing, however my only gripe is that the pork belly was a tad over cooked. But the favors from the watermelon was incredible."}
{"text":"3.5 stars+* overall! I really liked the food. The patio in the back was beautiful! Great place to sit with wooden benches and flowers it was lovely! Also love how there's a dog walking around and chilling on patio. Tacos were good, some were amazing some were ok.. The simple ones were a good deal(3-4 dollars) the \"fancy\" ones were a little steep for the small size. I like the set up of the bar in the patio it makes you feel like your somewhere else! Very limited options of beer on tap. It's a nice pairing with some of the more spicier options-watch out for the spicy chicken it's the spiciest one I tried there.. Service was ok.. They made us move around a  bit when bigger groups came in so we moved from shade to sun which was fine since it was a nice day but they jam packed our tables with more people so it gets cozy! But duely note even on slow days they won't split bills even though it was slow and it was just me and my bf at the table."}
{"text":"I went to the grand electric for my twenty fifth birthday with some of the girls, they went straight after work to put our names down on the infinity list -- needless to say - a Thursday night is probably just as crazy as a Monday - but the wait was cushioned by shopping and experiencing the rest of the west.

The guacamole and taco's are amazing, any yelper will tell you that - for me the highlight was our server and the witty rapport from the staff. 

After one to many burbon lemonades (amazing) - our conversations went from funny to funnier and the food kept pouring out -

The fish taco's have all the hype - they are nothing compared to the pigs tale - yes, you read that right - and no - it isn't a tiny corkscrew in a taco. Trust me - it will blow your mind."}
{"text":"Finally came here at 10pm on a Tuesday and there was no line. But it was still busy and we got the last table. The ambiance is small and nice. Only the tacos were available, it was their late night menu.

I had the Baka fish, Pork belly, Corn supreme. Baka fish taco was the largest of these small tacos, fried battered fish in taco with a bunch of yummy ingredients that I didn't remember. It was good. My favourite was the Pork Belly because it had mango which made it sweet. The Corn Supreme was also good,  it was made with corn fungus, the waiter seem to take pride in emphasizing that point. 

Overall it was a good experience and would like to come back and try the full menu. The desert looked very good but I'm trying to be careful of what I eat, maybe on binge day!"}
{"text":"You're not yet finished savouring your fucking incredible baja fish tacos and fried cauliflower tacos, but your plate gets yanked from under your nose and now you're dripping pico de gallo into your delicious bourbon cocktail and the servers are giving you the general impression that as soon as you take your last precious bite of your last amazing taco, they want you to get the hell out, regardless of whether or not you plan to continue slamming bourbon cocktails in your uncomfortable miniature folding chair and awkwardly shouting with your new friends over the ridiculously loud, early 90s Ice Cube."}
{"text":"Grand Electric needs to focus on providing better service to its customers who take the time to travel to their restaurant for a meal rather than focusing all of their time on Uber Eats. Waited an unreasonable amount of time for food to come out. When we ordered a second round, took again an unreasonable amount of time for 2 tacos. Felt forgotten about and never even received part of our order, so we ended up canceling the order and getting the bill."}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is all about. We tried 5 different kinds of tacos and their chicken wings. They were okay but nothing memorable. They don't have a wide selection of drinks either. No frozen margaritas...."}
{"text":"Definitely love at 1st bite.  We tried 5 different tacos, nachos, margaritas and 1 more thing..can't remember but it was delicious too.

Really fun atmosphere, friendly servers.  Like that the menu is not complicated. 

Beware of extremely long line ups.  So eat a snack before you go and be prepared for 1 - 2 hr waits, especially on Fridays and Saturday evenings.  my husband and I went to some bar down the street and killed time there."}
{"text":"Love the food here! It's a small menu mainly consisting of tacos but there are other things like spicy squid, tuna ceviche etc. I ordered the guac and chips to start while we were looking at the menu, and it came out with a huge pork crackling sticking out of it (yay for unexpected crackling)! 

Between my friend and I we tasted most of the tacos and each one was better than the last, so you can't really go wrong there. There's only one vegetarian option which was the deep fried cauliflower taco (which was amazeballs). I was a little disappointed though to discover that the pork belly is only served as a lunch item, despite it being listed as a dinner item on the website. Boooo.

The list of bourbons go on and on, however they have a daily special for $4 a shot which makes the decision making process just that little bit easier! There's also beers and cocktails if you're not into bourbon.

There's a few downsides to this place - 1) The music is super loud. Which is a shame really, because the music is actually pretty cool. But it's hard work screaming at the person sitting next to you just so you can hear each other. 2) After we'd finished our meal the bill appeared on our table and we felt hurried out. It would have been nice to order another round of drinks before leaving but I guess there's a bit of a demand for seats in this place.

Overall, I really liked this place and would definitely come with friends. Perhaps not the best place for a date!"}
{"text":"I do not understand the hype aaaaat allll!! 


ok to start I ordered the squid & I asked  for no green onion sprinkled on top. The waitress told me no modifications are allowed. So already I'm kinda of annoyed. 

Finally it comes and it's waaay smaller then I expected and had seen on instagram. 

Then the tacos come and they bring the wrong order, so we wait for ours. 

We got chicken , beef cheek, mushroom & fish. 

Mushroom I didn't even finish , I didn't like 

The rest were all ok...... 

Nothing special 

Wouldn't come back"}
{"text":"We showed up for lunch and were the first table to be sat. For a starter we got the chips and dips: so good!! Highly recommend. After a recommendations from a friend, I got the cauliflower taco and the shrimp (I liked the shrimp slightly better but both were good). My boyfriend got the carnitas and pork belly tacos; he preferred the pork belly. 

While the food was amazing, honestly the music was borderline make-or-break it. An atrocious array of gangster rap and strange mixes played very loudly all meal. We were fine due to being there before too much of the crowds but I would warn that the music is loud/annoying (owners, please change or lower the music!!)

Overall we enjoyed and would go back for the food. Recommend as long as you don't mind the music choice and it blaring :)"}
{"text":"Where do I Start off. 

Firstly, if you plan to come here... you should be prepared to wait 1 hour. Or more. They claim they do not take reservations, so when asked about the 2 free tables, their response was those are reserved! After promtly saying no reservations. And also watch people with no reservations, get seated before you. Not only did the staff act unbelievably discriminatory, they were inconsistent and lied to us about not taking reservations. During our 1 hour of waiting, we saw 3 tables of people without resso get seated before our group of 3. People whom had arrived after us waiting for 45 minutes who were 'locals' got seated before us because they know the staff.

The staff was blatantly making it clear they did not want to give us a table. However we stand our ground in order to try this hyped up taco place. But also out of our own respect and dignity we don't feel they should treat anybody this way.

There is a manager whom is Blond and the remaining wait staff all unprofessional to discuss and SWEAR infront of their customers. Manager hissed in my husband's ear as he got seated to show her reminder of her displeasure that we were seated. 

I happened to leave to go to restroom and had heard the wait staff be very rude and SWEAR about our table and my 3rd guest within the table. This is seriously unacceptable behavior. We spent quite alot here. Almost $200.00 on tacos, and alcoholic beverages. 


This place I will say is the best tasting tacos in Toronto. However not the BEST tacos.

The alcoholic drinks were more bitters and light alcohol + watery. 

The Squid and their Shrimp Taco would be the best out of all the items on their menu. The shrimp taco was nicely balanced with sweet, and crunchy. This goes the same for the Calamari. 

Guacamole dip was over seasoned with lemon leaving it to taste extremely sour. 

Their chicken taco, mushroom and fish all were too sour. The do not get the right balance of flavours with these 3. 

Overall I would never come back again because of the rude way we were all treated. I DONT reccomend this to anyone either because of the unprofessional staff. It wasn't worth being disrespected to have this food."}
{"text":"Update 2015: Hmm, be aware that there are 116 un-published reviews of Grand Electric on Yelp, which would take the average 4 stars down hard.  There are lots of one stars, as recently as January 2015.  Service has tanked.  I haven't been back since 2013, and upon reading these poor souls' reviews, I'm glad.  

Here's what it was like in March of 2013:

2 stars for a great food place is criminal, to be sure--so I'll give it 1.  The popularity of this place has hit a critical mass that makes going here an ordeal.  You will suffer dearly for the pleasure.

Everything you've heard about this place is still true: 

1. you will make sexy noises when you eat ANYTHING on this menu (taco or non-taco) because the food is gorgeously delicious.  The right size.  Good price.  Go on--order anything!
2. the dishes come fast!
3. people line up outside because of 1 & 2.  We had a 2 hour wait (we waited nearby on call).  Finally seated at 10:30pm on a Monday at a communal table.  So, you better really want to go.

Sad things:

Some of the servers are clearly worn down by the volume of humanity that has filtered through this place.  There is unnecessary attitude.  Like, in super dim lighting, far from the menus and I had a person sitting on either side of me on a bench (i.e. trapped!), I had just asked for a beer to start (but didn't know their selection off by heart)--telling me \"Well, then, you're gonna have to go up and look at the menu yourself\" is unhelpful.  How about just suggesting a beer and bringing it?  Stupid.  For a place that puts the price emphasis on their bar, sell a drink, lady!  At 10:30pm, why is it so much work for a friggin bottled beer?

We had to get up and get cutlery ourselves: eating open-faced tacos of mini-mounds of glorymeat requires civilizing tools.  Then, the waitress was going to clear away all the cutlery, even though we had ordered more tacos!  Why?!

They are letting their service slip.  But the kitchen is inspired as ever.  The creepy octopus tentacles were astoundingly flavourful.  Brussel sprouts, super crispy and savoury with--was it bacon (??) should have higher street value than crack.

If you only have a choice of 2 desserts, the key lime pie is way better than the chocolate from hell (it was called something like that), which was really from out of a box probably.

Looking forward to their BBQ location!  Eat here if you are all 'boutcher belly and don't mind risking the sickening attitude from the servers.  Plan ahead.  Drink somewhere else to save on the attitude and the money."}
{"text":"First time coming here since the area near La Carnita on John St was too packed and couldn't find parking without paying $17. I didn't like it as much. Found the taco tortilla was dry and not enough sauces. The spicy squid was okay, loaded with jalapeños. It was definitely spicy. Cute little place. My boyfriend and I stayed for about 30 minutes as we felt like we were taking up too much space. We were seated at the corner near the door with the booth seats (sits about 5 people). We were told to sit at the end beside the bar since there was 3 people and they were about to leave. Service is good. Servers came often - not in an annoying way."}
{"text":"Good vibe and great tacos. It's a busy spot and not a big restaurant, so don't expect to be seated right away. Always fun to try the different specials and I've never been disappointed by anything on the menu. The chips and dip, fish tacos and chicken tacos (spicy!) are my favs. Come here if you're looking for good, authentic Mexican tacos and snacks. Cocktails are expensive though."}
{"text":"I think I'm in love! It is only my second time here (not my fault - I tried coming during the renos!) 

This is seriously my gluten free heaven! So many delicious gf options - I'm not stuck with a blah salad!

Newly renovated, we went to the now winterized patio...I did have some drops of rain fall through the tarp that shielded us from being drenched but that's a small price to pay for this place!

My only issue with the patio is that there's NO MUSIC (caps so that they see this and hopefully add some music to the patio!) The music they play inside is awesome and as always, creates a great atmosphere so hopefully they get some speakers going in the patio soon!

First off: The Tuna Ceviche is by far my favourite thing on the menu! It's light, zesty, filling and delicious! It has so much flavourand they do it so well!

Secondly: Don't go there without having their homemade corn tortilla chips and best guac I've ever had in my life (and yes, I have been to Mexico!)

Thirdly: Always ask for their appetizers, because it's not on the menu! I was told to have their Miami Ribs but when she told me the app menu they had pork ribs with peanut sauce.  She recommended the Miami Ribs but said they don't always have the pork ribs, so naturally I went for them! The ribs came in a set of 4 - definitely share those because I had 2 and a beef cheek taco (and quac and chips) and I was done!

Always happy with the service, everyone is so friendly, and you feel like you're just at a friend's place :)"}
{"text":"Probably one of the best taco joints I have been to. The Baja fish taco and shrimp taco is delicious. Service was good. Only complaint is  the resturant is a little packed and pretty loud. Will recommend though."}
{"text":"This used to be my go-to taco place in Toronto, but I don't know what happened!  The food quality has really decreased. The tacos now are borderline disgusting and drenched in oil--they literally make me sick to my stomach. The baja fish tacos, once my favorite pick at GE, were a disaster the last time I went. The music was blaring so loud, it was unbearable. Totally disappointed!"}
{"text":"My favorite taco spot in Toronto. The tacos are not traditional or authentic, but they are amazing. My favourites: fish, beef cheek, scrapple, fried cauliflower. The food is light, fresh and each bite is full of flavour. The restaurant is quite small so try to get there early to avoid a wait."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place as I've heard great things, but I wasn't totally impressed. Overall this place was good, but not amazing. The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual and relaxed. 

Tried the chips and dip, shrimp special which came with slaw in a bun, fish tacos and spicy chicken taco. The chips and dip were pretty good. I love that it came with a bunch of different dips and pickled onions, but the salsa was not worth eating. Wish they had given a little more chips as the ratio was a little off. The shrimp in the bun was delicious. The shrimp were crispy and sweet and the mix with the slaw was perfect. The fish taco was disappointing. The fish wasn't very fresh and the toppings didn't enhance this taco. This was my first fish taco fail. The chicken taco was waaay too spicy for me that I took one bite and that was it. The flavour was great so if you love spice, you should definitely try this."}
{"text":"GE would get four or five stars if 1) the wait for a table wasn't an eternity and 2) the staff weren't so pretentious. The last time I went, I sat at the bar and waited......... for service. Not cool. With the size of the place it should turn over people fairly quickly. It's not like the tacos are that big, the ambience anything special or the staff very engaging. Too bad, so sad."}
{"text":"oh lawd, this place was fantastic. i'm visiting toronto for the first time and this was my favorite place on the trip. we got the calamari, the wings, and the pork belly taco. everything was paired perfectly. i never thought to top calamari the way they did but it was literally perfect, probably some of the best i've ever had. even the michelada was good, which is few and far between on the east coast.

the only reason i gave 4 stars is because there are  no modifications to your order unless you have an allergy. the calamari has mayo on it and my boyfriend doesn't eat that but they wouldn't allow me to get it without, which is a little silly since it's an appetizer to share..

other than that, everything was amazing and i can't wait to go back and try more."}
{"text":"Very hip and creative.

This is anything but Mexican...really.  It's tacos with all sorts of fused tastes that work very well with each other.

Expect Queen W price to quantity ratio, however."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time going here. I found the tacos good, but not awesome. I think because everyone has hyped this place up, I had high expectations.

I liked the Baja fish taco the best. The fish was cooked perfectly, and the batter was crispy and light. I also ordered the beef cheek taco. Didn't really enjoy the beef cheek taco, it was a bit too sweet for me. We also ordered chips and guacamole. I do enjoy their guacamole and chips, which is yummy. We also decided to try the fish ceviche. It was okay, not the best ceviche. However, the chunks of tuna were nice and big. 

The restaurant gives off a cool hipster vibe. The place is small and gets full pretty quickly. They don't take reservations so if you are going during the dinner rush, be prepared to wait or go for a drink first and then go back. I wouldn't wait hours to get in though. But then again I dislike lines/waiting, and Toronto has so many other choices for, that I'd just go somewhere else.

They do have a cool selection of different bourbon drinks and cocktails, so give it a try if you like bourbon."}
{"text":"I continued my hunt for the best tacos in Toronto, so I decided to give Grand Electric a try. 

While I was running late, my friend was dealing with the seating fiasco at Grand Electric. I had read of horrifying stories where the wait was about 2-3 hours long, and we were really trying to avoid that. Luckily, a table for 2 went for about a 15 minute wait, so we stuck around. Unfortunately, they cannot seat you unless your whole party is there (Very understandable. It's an incredibly small space).

The atmosphere is very... interesting? I liked it. It's quite dim, but they let the natural sunlight in from the large bay window. Whiskey and bourbon bottles line the walls of the restaurant and while the seats look very uncomfortable for a person who is 5'8, they were actually pretty comfy. Seating can get quite... intimate, but space is limited, so get cozy people!

Now, for the food. My friend and I split a pitcher of mojitos (way more than enough for the two of us) and it was delishhh! Pretty strong and so yummy and only $32. Then we decided to get the pork carnita, spicy chicken, and baja fish tacos. All of the tacos we're very flavorful and just $3.60 each. The spicy chicken wasn't too spicy, so I kicked it up a bit with the hot sauce that was on the table. The baja fish was good, but I've had better fish tacos. The pork was really good. I'm not a huge pork fan, but it was so good that we decided to get another round. 

Our server was super friendly and very funny. She made sure to check up on us quite frequently and ensure that our cups were always full. 

As much as I'd love to give Grand Electric 5 stars, I can't. It seemed that the girl at the door really wanted to amp up the hipster vibe of this place, by kicking out our friend that had arrived late. She looked at her and said that they were \"over-capacity\" but I did see an empty seat at the bar. When our friend became very disgruntled, the hostess came to \"diffuse\" the situation, but it was a little too late and our friend had walked away. Maybe they'll learn not to be so exclusive next time when there's someone else in line that will make them some money."}
{"text":"Tried it out yesterday, great little place, amazing taco, beef taco is my favorite! Parking is not a problem, on the street or you can go the parking lot next to the dollarama."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait forever. Amazing tacos. The beef cheek and pork belly are absolutely fantastic. It's a great, small menu - exactly how Mexican should be. We went with a group and ordered some of everything, which is a wonderful way to do it. 
There were six of us and we went in to put our name on the list at 8:00. We didn't get a table until after 11:00PM! It's really tasty and well done, but it's not 'wait three hours' great."}
{"text":"This place used to be a staple when eating out any day of the week. The owners have since changed the recipes, and portions-adding more fillers, salt, carbs and spice. The food has legit gone down the whole which is so sad and disappointing.
I used to always corn for the tuna ceviche. Tonight they mixed old ceviche with fresh ceviche as some pieces were absolutely gross and strongly fishy and others were fresh and delicious. Strongly recommend you go elsewhere for tacos as this place has SIGNIFICANTLY gone down the hill and IS NOT worth the money anymore."}
{"text":"This place is probably the one and only reason why Toronto sucks so so so very much. The oozing infantile passive aggression that permeates the atmosphere in here is why Toronto sucks so much. The texting to tell you that your table won't be ready for another eighty minutes (and then texting you sixty minutes later to tell you that if you're not there in three minutes that they'll give away your spot) is why Toronto sucks so much. Also the food is pretty meh. ------ The antidote and solution to this quandary is pretty close by and it is called MONTRÉAL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Beautiful and nonchalant and cultured Montréal. Vive la différance ! 

\"...the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness. For he truly is his brother's keeper...\"    --Pulp Fiction

Now, I really wanted to write a good review about how this place was amazing and all avant-garde and shit and how it's cool that they don't have a sign outside and all that jazz but it just ain't going to fucking happen. Okay. So very sorry but ... not really. C'mon we all know that Toronto sucks but who among us doesn't know that Montréal fucking rocks the awesomeness of cool!?!

The truth is that you (Toronto and Grand Electric) are weak. And I am the tyranny (humble Yelper) of evil men (with healthy and working taste buds that function) ... but I'm trying (to eat some semblance of good food) Ringo, I'm trying real hard to be a shepherd. 

To reiterate: this place is exemplary of why Toronto sucks so much. True story. This place is much much much over-hyped and exponentially over-priced for the pseudo-highfalutin bullshit that they purport to show off as ambiance and the passable garbage that they purport to serve as food. The only seemingly vegetarian taco to be itemised on the menu was something called the \"Crispy Cauliflower\" and it was not vegetarian at all. I'm like your mother: I wasn't angry; just very very disappointed in you. Also, cauliflower? Seriously, cauliflower? Cauliflower sucks even more than Rob Ford and T.don't combined does. The guacamole was alright but I could whip something up at least comparable to that at home with two desiccated halves of two and a half rotting avocados, some three year old limescale whilst blindfolded with one arm tied around my back. Don't forget the electrodes clamped to me nipples. The salad was passable as a salad but perhaps too strong on the vinegar. So yeah, this place is trying to be something that it obviously is not and it is failing miserably. Except, that is, for all the hype and business it gets from all you mindless automaton shills for whom cool is an hours long queue outside and for whom value for dollar is a 5,99$ cupcake for your Pomeranian/Shihtzu cross. Well, you're in luck because your wannabe hipster doofus dog will love this gourmet canine food but if you've got working taste buds and any self-esteem whatsoever you'd escape this hellish dreamscape as soon as possible. 

The only good thing about Grand Electric is the fact that there is an exit to leave from whence you came. 

Okay and their drinks are kind of good. They also have an extensive Bourbon list but that doesn't make up for the Satan-worshiping evil that they pretend is service and the stank ass nasty that they serve as food.  

If you really want some excellent Mexican / Mexican fusion in a warm and friendly convivial atmosphere you need to get on your hoverboard and propel yourself up the highway 401 to a place called Grumman '78 in the Saint-Henri neighbourhood of Montréal. We will be waiting for you arms open and legs akimbo. The best Torontonians are the ones that move to Montréal. So ... à la prochaine fois mes amis.

*Disclaimer*
I do not actually hate Toronto. Toronto is probably like the fourth or fifth best city in Canada (after MTL, Fulford on Salt Spring Island, B.C., Vancouver, St. John's and Ottawa) so that's a pretty good place to be! As a proud denizen of the metropolitan and cosmopolitan Montréal, born and bred, I have been indoctrinated into the Cult of Toronto Sucks. Notwithstanding that to a certain extent, Toronto does suck, I have overcome this indoctrination also to a certain extent yet there is still a valid lingering residual in the background of my cognition on this subject. Thank you for your understanding. Leafs suck. Go Habs Go. Vive la Ville de Montréal !"}
{"text":"Come early if you want a seat!

James and I came on a Saturday night around 5:45pm and the restaurant was already full. The place itself is quite small to begin with, so for dinnertime on weekends, expect this place to be pretty packed. 

This place is known for their tacos so we literally ordered every type of taco available on the menu (there are 8 in total). I would highly recommend the Pork Belly & Shrimp tacos but I would recommend staying away from the Cauliflower taco (it's literally just cauliflower on a tortilla roll). We also ended up getting an additional order of Tuna Ceviche because we realized the 8 tacos didn't end up being filling enough. 

Despite this place being $$, we ended up spending over $50 for 2 people which isn't super cheap, especially since James and I were still hungry afterwards. 

I would recommend coming here once maybe for the experience, but honestly, you can get equally as good of tacos (and Mexican food) in a bunch of other places around Toronto too."}
{"text":"favorites were the baja fish and beef cheek tacos! was pretty bumping for 5pm on a sunday, had a really awesome vibe and great music playing. was a bit small on the inside so i could see the wait being long at other times, but otherwise was a great place!"}
{"text":"My date said: We have to be there by 5:30 or we won't get a table.
We were there at around 6..perhaps after 6 and there was a LONG line.  (The place opens at 6pm).  
After maybe 15 minutes in line all the tables were full but we snagged a seat at the bar outside. 
GREAT little patio.

-The bartender/servers were all so good looking and nice.  It made my experience that much better because half the bonus fun of this place is the people watching.
-They have a really smart business concept- even thought the lineups look impossible they really aren't- tacos are fast food- the food is fast and the turnover is high because the drinks are priced just above the amount ($8+)  you would want if you were to just spend the rest of the evening drinking with friends (especially for parkdale)
-It's not expensive- maybe 40$pp for a great meal, drinks, taxes &tip in- but it certainly isn't cheap.  ESPECIALLY for Mexican food.  From reading reviews of when it first opened it seems like prices have also gone up around 2$/dish... but the demand is there so, why not?

Pros:
-Great food, well seasoned.  delciious.  We had the tacos el pastor, fish, chicken and the special of the day; the miami ribs (too saucy and \"asian\"-sauce tasting for my liking- I would not order); tuna ceviche (I could have had 10 of these).  All were delicious
-Nice strong cocktails.  We ordered cocktails and didnt' finish them.  I got romanced by the description and forgot that I didn't like cocktails (I'm a beer & wine girl)- but they were very well done with a solid strong, but balanced, taste.
-The place is small, cozy, and great for dates.
-The food is really true to mexican style- from the tortillas the pork skin the chips etc.  it is very true to style but with premium ingredients.
-the people are good looking- (hey, it doesn't hurt, eh?)
- even at 7 on a saturday night there were plenty of 2 person tables.  (You shoudl be fine as long as you aren't a large group
-they have s sink outdoors to wash your grubby taco-filling stained hands so that you don't have to walk all the way downstairs to the (yes, very clean) washrooms


Cons- 
-yes, it is too loud inside.  Not a place to \"catch up\"
-It's cramped- this might be annoying to some- but I'm petite and deal with it fine (but given that i'm a petite girl I also did find it cramped)
-If you are a group of more than 2 it could be a slight wait.  More than 4 and put your name down and come back after a couple rounds at the cadillac or rhino
-The miami ribs- not a fan- but other yelpers seemed to like them.
-The desserts don't seem like great value.  But I didn't order dessert so I can't say if they were mind-blowingly worth it

Overall, I'd definitely come back..several times (to try out a rotating menu).  Maybe stick to beer, a few tacos and the ceviche.

*note- there are a lot of people who complain about the wait.  To be honest- I can't imagine the wait being that long- even if the line looks uber long.  But if you're wondering if it is worth an hour + wait?  then NO- it is not.  It is worth a 30 min wait in line if you are not willing to go grab a beer at a neighbourhing bar while you wait. 
It is good food that is a must-try, but certainly not painstakingly -2hr lineup food."}
{"text":"We had the zucchini salad, spicy chicken wings, pork belly tacos, fish taco, spicy chicken tacos. The food was amazing except the fish taco was soggy. We ordered a Jesus juice and was half way through it when our waitress accidentally dipped her thumb into it. She took it away and came back to ask if we would like another one. I would of automatically assumed she would bring out another one but the fact that she had to ask was a bit upsetting."}
{"text":"The hype does seem to have died down somewhat (at least during the week) and if you come in on a weeknight at around 8, 8:30 - you will likely only have a 20-30 minute wait. They take your number and notify you by text that your table is ready (in theory.) I feel horrible for the poor hostess: they have put a blaring speaker directly over where this person stands and it is essentially impossible to communicate. Small thing, but definitely going to keep away... um, old people. Or, wait, strategic?!!

I do have to say though: we were told the wait would be 30 minutes, and went back upstairs to a friend's home to help move a piece of furniture. However, 10 minutes later my phone went off, saying HOORAY, they'd had a cancellation and we should come back as soon as possible. By the time we'd even gotten our coats and gathered our belongings and returned, I'd already gotten a \"we're about to give away your table,\" text. The tone of the communication turns a good thing into a bit of a stressful situation and a negative. If we'd walked into another bar and gotten a beer - and had a hard time getting the bill - we likely wouldn't have made it and likely never would have returned.

But. The food. We tried everything except for the cauliflower. In order from least favourite to best:

5. BEEF SHOULDER - a bit on the dry side, with a slightly sweet bbq sauce. A bit too many hot peppers kind of kill the experience (and I tolerate heat very well.) Still enjoyable, just not for my palette.

4. BAJA FISH - fish tasted excellent and very nicely breaded. Very generous portion, but a bit too much slaw buried the flavour of the fish with acidity. Felt way more balanced when some of that was removed. Not the best fish taco I've had in my life, but still very nice.

3. SPICY CHICKEN - this is legit spicy, be fairly warned. But great tasting.

2. PORK TINGA - pork is beautifully seasoned and flavourful and the topping proportions are excellent. Extremely tasty.

1. SCRAPPLE - Oh. My. Bees. The server described this as being pig head and a bit of cornmeal fried into a cake... I am not stupid about where on the animal the meat comes from (or generally from which animal within reason) but pork is usually the answer to everything and I went for it. I just, I can't... I can't even describe it, it's a flavour punch to the face for sure and the texture is amazing. Eat it. Eat four.

Service was great and fast. The bartender was making Proper Cocktails and tasting every single thing that went out (with a straw, natch.) We didn't taste them, but were impressed with her attention to detail and commitment to perfecting and balancing what she was making. 

Would love to go back and get some sides, I suspect they would be great. All in all - worth a wait, and might be the best taco joint I've been to in the city (have to return to El Asador and compare again - it's a tough life.)"}
{"text":"Taco this weekend...we thought to go to La Carnita...however they dont open till 5pm and Grand electric was the easy choice. 

Walked in around 12:15pm and the place was a ghost-town (indoor). The waitress offered to take us to the patio and there was 1 picnic table left with our names written all over it. I'm not a regular- and this was my first time. Apparently this is a big deal and my prize for being an early worm. I found out the hard way as exactly an hour later while i was leaving. The indoor section was packed and people lined up outside to try and get in. Insane. Glad I went bright and early!

We waited for our lunch mates and ordered from the wide variety of cervesaz- both local craft and household Mexican beers. Ample choices and on a nice summer day- beer on the patio ( no bugs - which is a plus). I also liked the fact that it wasn't just one server assigned to us and that we got attention from multiple servers who were informative and helpful and communicated well with each other very effectively.

Items I sampled in order of favorite to least:

1) Baja Fish- as carnivorous as I am and a big fan of chicken and red meat. This was hands down the pick of the crop. Deep fried but light and crispy. Garnished well. Yum
2) Spicy Chicken- Was good- had a lot of flavor in it. however a little light on the meat department so the garnishes over took the taste. Not as spicy as i would like for a Mexican place- however they have a lot of hot sauces in different flavors for you to add on.
3) Kale Ceaser Salad- took us a while to figure out what the orange seasoning on top of the salad was. Asked the server and she told us it was pumpkin seeds. Large portion- more than enough for 2-3 people.
4)Shrimp taco- I don't know, it didn't work for me. I think the deep fried shrimp and texture didn't gel well as it was chewy and it didn't mix with the other garnishes for this item. Wasnt bad-however i ordered a 2nd Baja fish to bring my spirits back up.

Was a great experience and not that expensive either. Give it a go!!!"}
{"text":"Great tacos.  A great neighborhood spot. Lots of charm. Expect a wait. 

What to order: 
Chicken tacos- 
Don't normally love chicken tacos, as they are often bland, but these were juicy and perfect! 

Tuna ceviche- tasty dish. It has an intense lime / citrus flavor and could have used some chips to accompany it. 

What to skip :
Fava beans and chorizo- flavors didn't really mesh with the rest of the menu"}
{"text":"Meh.... I like the simple menu but please tell us what you are going to put on my tacos!!

I happen to be VERY picky...more plain jane style and did not like the pickled toppings on each of  my tacos.

A friend and I went in for an early dinner late lunch (linner or dunch) around 4 pm the music was LOUD....even a little too loud for peak bar times on a Sat night."}
{"text":"We didn't stay long enough to order food. 

When my friends and I arrived, all of the tables in the dining area were full, so we were seated at the bar (also packed). There were only two bar stools at the very end of the bar, and three of us. I volunteered to stand, as the wait didn't seem like it would be too long. 

We ordered a round of drinks. Once the drinks came to us, and I started to sip from my beer, the bartender came over to me, whisked my beer away from me and told me that I had to be seated before I could drink from my glass. I turned to demonstrate that there was absolutely nowhere that I could sit. The bartender then said that it is a rule in this restaurant that people can only consume alcoholic beverages when seated in a chair.

My friend asked \"are you serious?\" Then he asked to speak to a manager. My beer was not returned to me, having been placed behind the bar, out of my reach. We waited for 15 minutes, but no manager ever came to speak to us. We left enough money on the bar to pay for 2 out of the 3 drinks that we had ordered, and promptly departed.

Just weird...all around."}
{"text":"Came here close to 5pm on a Mon night. No line and just beat the rush.
Ordered Guac and chips, tacos: baja, crispy cauliflower, beef cheeks, scrapple, dinner dishes: papa octopus, tuna ceviche.
Everything was super oily.  The chips are refried in oil. The taco wraps were covered in oil (from filling), I couldn't pick them up.  Flavor profiles were confusing as you really couldn't taste the fish/meat.  They were overpowered by the fried batter, sauce or jalapeno.  If I had to pick a favorite, it would be the beef cheeks (after taking out the jalapeno -else that's all you taste)
Papa octopus is fried octopus with potato.  We did not bother eating them.  Really nothing special.  Tuna ceviche is worth ordering. 
Before the end of my meal, my stomach was hurting due to the grease.  It did not go down well. I would not come again.  
Perhaps the high ratings on here is for the drinks."}
{"text":"By now everyone knows this place is the real deal and while it's hard as balls to get a table, it's well worth the wait.

Ranking the tacos:
1. Spicy Chicken
2. Fish
3. Beef Cheek
4. Pork Belly
5. Cactus

That is all. Everyone already knows this place is legit."}
{"text":"Loved it....very cool atmosphere. 
Sat in the back on picnic tables ordered 
We ordered the chips and salsa we also ordered the kale salad which was amazing. The wings were great. 

Over all great food and cool atmosphere 
5/5. We will return"}
{"text":"Yeah its filled with hipsters but the tacos are amazing. The wait is usually long tho.. i don't think waiting 2 hours for a meal makes sense but if you really want to try this place, make your reservation and have a few drinks at The Rhino or Duggan's Brewery while you wait."}
{"text":"We recently had these guys cater to our party which was a pleasant experience. Food was heavenly especially the shrimp skewers...spicy and delicious. The staff and the chef managed to setup shop in our backyard in no time. They fed 160 people and no one had anything but praise to say. Food was absolute amazing."}
{"text":"*** OK Tacos ***
For years it's been hard to get a seat at this place and finally on a quiet Sunday night we were able to get a seat at the bar. Maybe because I've had better luck at getting seats at the bar at La Carnita but I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be. I think the hype kind of killed the experience for me. Unfortunately I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Went for a Sunday lunch and Grand Electric was busy, but we were still able to get a table for two without a wait. The atmosphere was fun and very casual. Definitely a place I'd go with friends but I don't think my parents would appreciate it as much. 

We really enjoyed the super fresh salsa, guac and chips while we mulled over which tacos to try. We each got three mini tacos and by far my favourite was the fish taco! I would love to back and eat many many more of them! The fish was battered: crispy but not greasy. There was a creamy but citrus-ee dressing and it was topped with a satisfying crunchy shredded slaw (can't remember what it was). I also loved that they were soft tacos (not a fan of hard shell tacos)."}
{"text":"GE could be amazing.  I have a love/hate because the food is amazing.  I have been there at least 20 times, I am addicted to their Baja fish taco (best in the city), not only that their cocktails are very cool.  I love the GE sour, as well as the bourbon list.

The sad part is how it is run as a  hipster joint.  I can deal with the extremely loud rap music, but the staff really want you in and out of the place as quickly as possible.  They seem really unhappy, very urgent to take your order and nothing more.  As I mentioned I've been there over 20 times.  I seldom feel welcome there, I always tip 20%.  There is only one sever there who has acknowledged me as a regular, but I haven't seen him in a few weeks (the shorter guy covered in tattoos).

I would consider their prices fair.

G.E. Mud BBQ is also vey good but a different environment.  At  both places the food is amazing, but if you are looking for a place you can relax and enjoy more than 30 minutes in, look elsewhere.  They want you in and out as soon as possible.

The attitude is that they are too cool for the customer, that's hipster.  That will only last for so long.  So I'd still say check it out while you can.

{"text":"I know everyone's raving about the Baja but personally felt like the Cauliflower was much better. 

Wish they mixed the two: Baja fish taco ingredients (minus the fish) but with the cauliflower. Yummm... 

This is a small place in the Parkdale community with a cute patio where upon being seated I was warned about bees. I moved to the bar inside instead. 

They didn't have their orange hot sauce and were waiting on a shipment - I was told it's called Valentino and you can buy it in stores... here I was thinking it was made in-house... cmon Grand Electric!! 


Even though Grand Electric may have started the taco fiasco in Toronto... they're lacking in innovation. Feel like La Carnita has far surpassed them."}
{"text":"Since my husband and I moved to Toronto last August, this place continues to come up again again when I'm talking with locals about my favorite subject: food. \"You haven't been to Grand Electric!? OMG you HAVE to go!\"

Welp, a coupla weeks ago, we finally did. 

Walked in on a Saturday at 6pm (1/2 hour after opening) and were seated right away at a drafty community table next to the door. By the time our hipster waitress took our drink order there was already a lineup outside. Talk about timing!

I ordered a tequila drink, and husband ordered a bourbon drink. Both were inventive and delicious. 

We really appreciated the hip vinyl soundtrack, but the music was just. too. loud. We are not lame. We are not old. We did not come to dinner to discuss important matters. But it would be nice to be able to hear each other enough to coordinate our order. After a few shouts back and forth, some creative sign language, and standing up multiple times to read the chalkboard, we decided on:

Brussels and Chorizo: I love brussels and I love chorizo. The flavors were complex and decandent...sweet, savory, spicy.  But THE GREASE. I knew I wasn't ordering the \"heart smart\" appetizer, but c'mon. Flavors would still be there if they drained it off just a little. 

Spicy Squid: Wonderful texture, just enough heat. Best thing we ate. 

Scrapple Taco: Lotsa flovor, but again...super greasy

Beef Cheek Taco: See 'Scrapple Taco' description

Al Pastor Taco: See 'Beef Cheek Taco' description

Chicken Tinga Taco: Good. 

Bottom line: I think there is just a little too much hype around this place. Food is flavorful, but most dished are unescessarily doused in grease and creamy sauces. Atmosphere is cramped, cold, and loud. Servers are too cool for school.  

I think it MIGHT be worth trying this place again in the summer, to check out the patio and the guacamole. And maybe some more spicy squid : )"}
{"text":"Some of my favourite Mexican food in Toronto. It's authentic and the atmosphere is awesome. Always great service. The pork belly tacos are especially amazing."}
{"text":"BEST tacos ever!!! The fish tacos were my favourite, definitely a MUST! The chicken tacos were very spicy but still super good. The place is pretty small so I'd recommend going for lunch as then your almost guaranteed a seat right away."}
{"text":"There aren't many things I'll line up for - food is one of those things that my patience seems to tolerate!  While ex-Black Hoofers chef Colin Tooke and front-of-house manager Ian McGrenaghan tried to keep a low profile opening, word got out fast and had foodies and non-foodies alike queuing up to sample the goods!

With a Bourbon-heavy menu (probably one of the best-stocked in Toronto), craft beer, loud music and Mexican food - it's impossible to not fall in love with Grand Electric.

With line-ups starting as early as 5:15AM, you will want to get here early!  Don't even try to pull up 10 minutes before opening time (6PM), because you definitely won't get in the first seating.  Be prepared to leave your name and number, and they'll give you a ring when your table is available.  If you're waiting to nab my table, you probably won't get a call until 3 hours later, because it's one of those places where you sit down and don't want to leave!  Luckily Parkdale is not no-man's-land and there are plenty of places to hang out at until you get paged.

We ordered the Bourbonade and the Grand Electric Sour - and I must say that these are on my list of best cocktails in the city.  For me the Sour was definitely more interesting, as there were more intermingling flavours.

We started off with the Guacamole + Chips, and the guac is as fresh as linen out of a washing machine here; the tomato salsa doesn't pale in comparison either.  The chips are perfectly seasoned with what I would call \"lime salt.\"  And if that's not enough action for your taste buds, try out the two hot sauces Valentina and the Avocado & Tomatillo conveniently provided for all you condiment squeezers!

The main attraction here are the tacos.  We wanted to order them all, but decided to not be accused of having eyes bigger than our stomachs.  In the end, I decided to go off the beaten path, and order ones that were less common: Beef Cheek, Pig Tail, and Fried Queso + Poblano.  I had no regrets in ordering any of these, as they were all mouth-wateringly good.  And due to a miscommunication, we even got to try the Baja Fish on the house.  The winner for me, had to have been the beef cheek as it was succulent, tender, and the caramelized sauce for me, was a real winner!

Just when we were both happy to the point of belly-rubbing, our Spicy Squid arrived.  I love the sweet/spicy flavour profile that Grand Electric is rocking.  Lightly-breaded, and topped with jalapenos which are contrasted with a much milder (and spice-busting guac) - this dish knocked my socks off!  And with that our evening was perfect - at least until the Churros came.

To finish off the night, we had the good ol' Churros which were filled with a gooey dulce de leche, and dusted with cinnamon sugar.  These just melted in my mouth, and were a perfect finale to this ambrosial meal.

V E R D I C T

There is definitely no \"hype\" a Grand Electric because they really are as good as they're rumoured to be!   This is definitely one of those restaurants where the phrase \"Everything is good\" is not an overgeneralization.

I loved the beats that were blaring through the speakers intermittently between LP and iPod, even if it was a tad loud.  Tonight's selection was retro 70s with a little bit of \"throwback\" soul sound.  A week after my Electric experience, I am still dreaming of their finger-lickin'-good noshes.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I know you want the tacos, but get the quesadilla. 
Specifically the al Pastor quesadilla.
It's really messy, but REALLY good. Hits all the mouth feels. 
Sweet, spicy, greasy, salty... it's everything.

Okay and then also get a fish taco because, you know you also really want the fish taco.
Or the shrimp taco which was also pretty tasty.

If you want to beat the crowds, try visiting for lunch (your boss will understand)."}
{"text":"Although the sign isn't much and the location is kind of difficult for first timers, this is a great place to stop and have some quick mexicana. The patio is a hidden gem. Tucked behind the intimate dining room, the patio is neatly decorated and offers quite the selection of generously alcoholic beverages. I've been there loads of times since moving to Parkdale and absolutely recommend checking the place out. Be sure to try their grilled octopus or their porkbelly taco - amazing."}
{"text":"One of the best tacos and nachos in GTA. Always a long line if you visit during peak hours (weekends, evening) but I always find the line goes by real fast. No complaints about this place! Great service too!"}
{"text":"Environment: crampy and small but laid back cool vibes. The bar area is pretty cool and so is the bartender. There's a wait to come in here but we got lucky that there was a spot for two at the bar.

Food: took a little long for just two tacos - the chips and guac came out quick - but everything is expensive for what it all is. I am from Miami, FL and used to tacos being cheap comfort food.

Taste: ordered the beef cheek and the cauliflower tacos / very very good but not worth the long wait we did for the  food. 

$30 for two tacos , 1 beer , and guac w chips = expensive for tacos / Mexican. Wish it would've been cheaper."}
{"text":"Been here twice.  The tacos are really good.  Probably one of the better restaurants in Toronto, and they know it - could do without the bitchy service and holier than thou attitude.

You guys work at a taco place ok?  CHILLAX.

Lighten up hipsters."}
{"text":"This bar is everything you expect from the hipster era of dining. Artisan tacos, local beers, hand crafted cocktails, and loud hip-hop music from a time no one resonates with anymore. 
All that mediocrity threatens its lasting appeal but there is something special about it. It vibes along with a uplifting energy and the eats are very return worthy. Cocktails are well made and compliment the Mexican fare with precision. The hidden gem on the menu is the cauliflower taco. Get it."}
{"text":"We had the pigtail taco, pork belly taco, crispy pork salad, empanadas, guacamole and chips, and queso fundido. 

Pigtail taco and crispy pork salad was delicious. Others were good but a tad on the sweet side. Queso fundido was delicious. 

The host was extremely rude. I asked how long our wait was and if we would be able to sit at the bar while we waited for our table. He said, \"No, because we actually seat at our bar.\" I said, \"thanks\" then turned to walk back and rely the message. Apparently he rolled his eyes and shook his head as I walked away. For the record, not everyone in the world knows of how your 350 sq. ft. closet of a restaurant works. 

Other than that, the service was lack luster and restaurant was extremely loud."}
{"text":"The tacos are probably one of the best I've ever tasted. They're not your traditional tacos, as others have mentioned.

I highly recommend the Baja Fish. Comes with a pretty large piece of fish that is perfectly fried and not greasy. Topped with pickled radish and a creamy sauce.

The Beef Cheek is also really good. It's so tender and the sauce is delectable. Topped with sliced jalapeno peppers and guac. Even though there was a lot of peppers on each taco, it was surprisingly not that spicy."}
{"text":"Best tacos, best ceviche, the cocktails are not stingy with alcohol. Even though it's small inside everything about this place is \" go big or go home\". My favourite tacos add the fish, shrimp, pork belly and cauliflower. Surprisingly the cauliflower is so flavourful you don't realize there's no meat inside. The service is good and the music is always playing good hip hop or rnb. It's a Great place to chill and eat!"}
{"text":"Very good service and tacos are tasty. The mood and feel when you walk in is very casual and down to earth which is what I like. Your not surrounded by try-hard people. The ambiance, old rustic, woodie, bench-style or pub-style look I guess. The service was also great and quick. We walked in for lunch on a Tuesday.  There were about 3 tables to serve including us was 4. Got our orders and within no more then 10-15min all our ordered were sitting in front of us. Since there was only 2 of us, we shared everything. What we ordered: 
- Baja tacos (excellent)
- Cauliflower tacos (could use a bit more flavor)
- Pulled pork tacos
- Classic old fashioned cocktail
- my friend ordered this cocktail that had a facinating name but I can't remember it. All I know was that it was a light grapefruit pinkish color and a sprig of mint on top? Or maybe basil? 

Overall my experience here was great. Good food, good service and good drinks. I'd come back here again on those nights where you don't want to dress up fancy but just want to grab a casual bite to eat with friends. You can sit at the bar or get a table. The place is small so if you go on weekends I'm sure it'll be packed."}
{"text":"For the past 2 weeks I've had an unexplainable need for tacos everyday. Grand Electric was the second place I had been to on my hunt for the best taco spot in the GTA. I thought it was more of a restaurant, but it's definitely more of a bar. Not exactly ideal dining conditions for me but the delicious tacos more than made up for it.

I had the baja fish, pork belly and shrimp tacos. They were all so good! I liked the variety of sauces you could choose from - it definitely changed up the flavours. My only critique is that they should have small menus at each table. I'm sure during the day it's fine but at night you can barely see/read their menu. I'd come back again eventually but for now I'm still hitting up taco spots around the city!"}
{"text":"My last meal will probably be Mexican food so needless to say I love this restaurant ... the fish tacos are so flavourful and moist ... I've never had a bad meal here ... although in a perfect world the ceviche would be on a plate the size of the table !!"}
{"text":"I've tried going here on two separate occasions, but didn't end up going bc of the line ups. So I was surprised to have a table readily available when I went on a Saturday afternoon. It was still very busy though. 

Tacos and Spicy Squid  hoagie did not disappoint. Everything was tasty and seemed pretty fresh. My favorite was the beef cheek taco. Would definitely come back. Just thought the hoagie and pop were a little on the pricey side and the place is quite tight on seating. Hence the lineups."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about GE.  Came here for the third time, this time for my bday dinner on the long weekend. Made it in on the first attempt, AND on the patio!  Wish there was music on the patio like inside, but still a great atmosphere. The grill ont he patio is a fantastic touch, as is the bar. This place just keeps getting better and better. 

We did everything from cocktails, to appies, to tacos, to dessert this time. EVERYTHING was fantastic and spot on.

Had the spicy squid, spicy peanut ribs (ohhh myyyy godddd), and tacos. I stand by the Baja fish taco being the best thing I've ever eaten. I seriously love it that much. I don't care what anyone says, it's DAMN amazing. Crispy, tender, not greasy, flakey.. put the two house sauces on top and it's freaking heaven. 

The key lime pie dessert was perfect to end our meal and just fantastic. Every last bite of everything we ate was done with a 'Mmmmmmm' during the chew. 

*drool* Thank you GE for making my tastebuds dance!"}
{"text":"Went there during their lunch hours (11:30am-4pm) and it was amazing!! No crazy line-ups, we were even able to choose our table! 

I truly recommend getting the baja fish tacos. The batter was nice and crunchy and not at all greasy and the slaw on top was not overly creamy. Also make sure you save some room for dessert, their key lime is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place because my teacher had recommended that my class and I should head on down and eat there. Sadly, there were not enough tables to fit 16 people (which I understand with) and so later on I came here with some friends. I've visited this place four times now and overall everything is great (except for that one time where the waitress messed up the order but that was okay!) I enjoy the decor of the restaurant (especially the shark) and the chatter that is constantly playing in the background. I always eat inside or do take out and so I'm unaware of how the patio experience is like. 
However dining inside, there is a nice assortment of hot sauces that one can add to their food as well, every time I dine here it's never fully crowded (which is awesome!) however I've seen how crowded this place can become.  

I came here for the tacos and the tacos are still the highlight of Grand Electric. They have a variety of different tacos. Each taco sits on a corn (I think) tortilla base that I presume they make themselves. The tacos are very beautiful but eating them is very messy! (But no one comes looking for tacos to not get messy right?) By far the best taco that Grand Electric has is the \"Shrimp Taco.\" Everything about this taco is absolutely amazing. I recommend it completely! 

A close second would be the\" Baja Fish Taco,\" hearing that crunch when you first bite into it is so pleasing! I've had the chicken, mushroom, cauliflower, and pork tacos before and they were also tasty but the shrimp and the fish are by far the best. I would say for me, 3 tacos satisfies me, though 4 to 5 tacos may be the best number if you want to fill yourself.  
I've had the key lime pie here before and it tastes like no other key lime pie I've eaten. It's zesty, fresh and creamy, which I really love.

I keep coming back to this place for more tacos and honestly I'll probably end up buying numerous shrimp tacos the next time I go."}
{"text":"We visited Grand Electric on a Sunday evening at 7pm. 

As they had just opened for dinner service an hour earlier, we were seated on the patio right away. It was a cool rainy evening but the patio space was heated and lively, comprising a small tiki-like bar, a BBQ and grill master (grilling beef short ribs and corn), and about 15 tables (mix of picnic and two-person tables). Although we were seated at a separate table for two we were close enough to those beside us to hear the details of their conversation.  At first this was a bit uncomfortable but as the evening past this become less and less of a distraction.  Our friendly server came by about 10 minutes after we had been seated and was awkwardly able to navigate the small spaces between the tables to take our beer and guacamole order.  They have a small selection of local and US based craft brews of which I had the Bellwood Brewery's Farmhouse Ale.  The guacamole and chips arrived soon after the beer and we quickly dug in.  It was pretty good, but not the best we've had; maybe missing that punch (heat). Not to worry though, we were not here for the guacamole. Once our server returned for round two we ordered the four main taco's (Baja Fish, Pork Belly, Beef Cheek and Arbol Chicken).  They were all awesome save for the Chicken which was just OK.  Being someone who's usually not a fan of seafood I have to say that the Baja Fish Taco was a real surprise! The portions were small though so more than one app and four tacos are needed to fill two people.  As a result I ordered a second beer (Anchor Brewery's Liberty Ale) which I thoroughly enjoyed.  

For this review it was the food that mainly impacted the rating as the service and ambiance were average.  I would return to Grand Electric without a doubt and try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Friday. The service and wait for food was slow, I think we must have waited around 20min for our food to arrive, even though most people got their food already before we ordered.

However, when the food did arrive...everything tasted soo good! We got their mission wings, fish, pork belly and beef tacos, and Americana quesadilla. Everything exceeded expectations. If it weren't for the long wait I would have given it five stars without hesitation."}
{"text":"Minus the wait, the food was amazing!  Especially their cocktail selection! I would highly recommend if anyone was ever on wait list to go across to the bars to have a drink or two before hitting Grand Electric up! Definitely helps time pass quicker.  As for the food, I fell in LOVE with the baja fish, chorizo and beef cheek! surprisingly, the spicy cauliflower was not bad too, was full of flavor and didn't even taste like cauliflower! The Tuna Ceviche is a must try too! Tried a spicy bourbon, would definitely recommend it to those who like a mean caesar with a twist!"}
{"text":"Came to Toronto for the day and I am glad I found this hidden gem. There was a bit of a wait but it wasn't too bad. They have a small menu but a lot of good things to choose from. The tacos were on the pricey side in my opinion even with the currency exchange difference. But that didn't stop. The Baja fish taco is made to perfection. I couldn't have enough. The steak taco was okay. Couldn't have a little bit more flavor. Still yummy. The drinks could of been a lot stronger. I'm a light wait and can barely taste the alcohol. But overall I would come back."}
{"text":"I don't consider Grand Electric like a restaurant. I felt it like a Mexican tapas bar.

They have a big selection of Bourbons and everyday you can find a $4 dls shot deal.
The music is louder than in regular restaurants, and they play mostly rap and hiphop; which fits good with the outfits of most of the dude staff (Limp Bizkit kind of).
We ordered a guacamole with the $2 dls extra chicharrón;
2 pork belly;
2 baja fish;
2 beef cheek;
2 crispy piggy;
and 2 negras modelos.

The guacamole was tasty and I liked the red salsa as well. But the chicharron almost killed me... Seriously, if you put that much chilly-flying-powder, in the top of a crunchy, chewy, area; you'll have the best prank for your enemy... After biting that chicharron, my eyes were swollen, teary and blurry.

I got happy when I tasted the magic Negra Modelo (the bourbon among beers). And change the burn in my eyes, to the tongue, while enjoying the fresh green and red salsas.

When we saw the size and amount of each taco, we both new we were going to get drunk, instead of getting satisfied. Between paying $8 dls for two Jim Beans Vs $7 for other 2 mini tacos... 


The flavour was ok, but nothing remarkable. The service ok as well, for a not busy, rainy Saturday."}
{"text":"Lovely date spot. It's very small though, so it's hard to get a table or a seat at the bar! Their drinks and music can really set the tone! The staff is also super great with recommendations and super nice. 

I always enjoy my meal here, but with so many Mexican/fusion/taco places having opened up, I can see why people are not impressed, or feel that this place is overhyped. It's what you expect. 

It's good, but I only ever go if there is no wait!"}
{"text":"ok so I chose this place as my first Mexican experience.  I know there are very few bad reviews but I am basing my review on my thoughts.  First off this place was extremely busy.  We tried the loaded potatoes first and they were amazing.  As for the tacos they might have been a bit funky for me so I didn't care for them much.  Im more of a simple kind of guy when it comes to tacos.  Half way through dinner I started to feel extremely sick and did not leave the restaurant with out going to the bathroom 4 times.  It was a tough night.  Services was great considering how many people were there and we were a group of 5 people and I was the only one who was not well.  Like I said it could have been just me not that the food was not good."}
{"text":"Very well known and highly recommended by friends.  I finally tried it about a month ago and was a little disappointed as it doesn't live up to the hype.  Guacamole portion was small and not that great - I can make better at home or buy better at numerous other Mexican spots in the city.  Tacos were good but not exceptional.  Vibe is cool, our waitress was awesome, and playlist was fab."}
{"text":"Great food but service is horrible. Servers act like they don't want you there nor do they need you there. All the tacos are great, the beer isn't great for how expensive it is. I would go all the time if there wasn't an hour wait and a horrible attitude to customers."}
{"text":"Been here twice, great date spot. Tacos are amazing some of the best in the city. The nacho dip set is really good. They give you a selection of 4 hot sauces on your table so never a dull nacho chip. Micheladas are decent too. Margaritas are top notch."}
{"text":"I finally lucked out and made it to Grand Electric last Sunday and they actually had an available table!  Usually there is a minimum 30 minute wait so we end up going elsewhere but I was happily surprised this time to get a table right away!  We tried the spicy chicken & beef cheek tacos and they are amazing.  The spicy chicken isn't too spicy, it's just right, and I was pleasantly surprised with how good the beef cheek taco was.  

I hope to make it back there soon, and hopefully they will have a table available :)"}
{"text":"The first time I came here was around 7pm, and the wait was 2.5 hours, so I left.

second try was a Saturday, I wanted to arrive at 4:30 to 5:00 pm and waited till it opened, unfortunately unexpected dt traffic occurred.

Parking: good thing we found street parking right in front of the restaurant every time.

I arrived at 5:30pm, there was people already seated inside and still a line up outside to put our name down. The lady told me it's a 1-1.5hr wait. so we sticked around, walked around town and had some gelato, there's nothing much to do around here, and there's lots of people on the streets.

after a 1-1.5 hr wait, I wasn't counting and time went by pretty quick. probably got seated around 7pm-ish

we ordered 4 of the regular tacos and 2 special tacos and were were full. Will come back for more next time.

spicy squid - was our fav, the jalopinos really makes it spicy but delicious.
tuna ceviche - too much tuna, too cold, too much sauce, wet and soggy, did not enjoy.
baja fish - it was pretty good, the fish is salty and the toppings complimented it
fried cauliflower - one of my favs, can't believe I liked it so much, since I love meat, but did not miss the meat at all with this taco
chicken taco - I really liked this one cause of the mint in it
beef cheek - this one was a bit normal, but still good.

I think they priced it right and accordingly, unlike la carnita which is overpriced.

the service is quick and food came quick, but they rush you out even quicker as soon as your done. But that is understandable since there is such a long wait, I wouldn't want to stick around in there too long, I want to give other people a chance to come in.

this place is worth the wait.

CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"I am so happy that I no longer have to complain that there are no great fish taco's in Toronto. This place satisfies the craving for one of my favourite dishes!

Yes, the lines are long and it's noisy. But that's what a successful and vibrant restaurant looks like. Plan ahead for the wait and grab a drink at one of the nearby bars, just don't go when you're hungry!.

The guacamole is fantastic (it does come with a pork rind in the middle, be sure to ask for it removed if you don't eat meat). While there are some good mexican places in Toronto, few of them offer any selections for pescatarians. This place shines with their seafood. The shrimp tosta, the fish tacos, and the ceviche were the highlights of the meal (even for the carnivores). 

Their signature cocktail is delicious, and they make a mean michelada. 

The space they took over (cafe taste) is unrecognizable after their reno, but I hope they kept the dreamy garden in the back. I can't wait to try this place in Patio Season!"}
{"text":"expect to wait in line during peak lunch and dinner hours! 

Waiting in line can be a drag but why waste your precious time waiting around? i gave them my number and hopped a couple doors down to Porzia (i'll write their review after this one :P) until they texted us for an open table.

First, if possible, try not to sit near the door during this time of the year, we had our jackets on the whole time! expect when we were actually chowing down the tacos cuz you know how messy it could be ;)

secondly, bring a flashlight or a pair of reading glasses cuz im sure 90% of new comers can't read the menu off the blackboard thats by the bar and not to mention that the room is so dim. Waitresses knows this too and im sure they're fed up with repeating the menu a billion times a day and tell customers to get off their lazy bums and go up to the board to read LOL 

Thirdly, food is BOMB. love their tacos, but if you can't handle some heat then make sure you let the waitress know! though i don't eat spicy often it really kicks the right spot! so i recommend to try all tacos just to see what you like since my friends who really love cheese and cilantro likes the beef taco more than the pork tacos.
1. baja fish taco 
2. pork taco (taste like cha siu! or bbq pork puns :D )
3. i'm sure it would've been scrapple taco, now that i know that it's another type of fish taco, idky i thought it was a fruit....LOL

i really love seafood and got octopus el diablo cuz ya'know....it has octopus in it. WARNING: EXTREMELY HOT! I should've learnt what diablo meant D: 

drinks! ok im sure that their mixed drinks and cocktails are fabulous but who can turn down $4 shots?! they have different liquor shots during the week. I love how they bring the bottle and pour the shots in front of you. 

k. that's it for now. enjoyyyyy~"}
{"text":"good thing my friend and I arrived right when it opened.. we were just a few minutes behind (only 2 of us) and already, the whole restaurant was getting packed!! we managed to get seated at the bar area. 

The restaurant menu was limited.. but really -- only thing I want to try here is the fish taco!!
I did enjoy that... but along with some of the other tacos like the pork was ordered. For some reason -- i always compare it back to my experience and love for fish taco in L.A and it doesn't seem to compare... 
This proportion is small (but good enough size for Toronto) -- maybe the ones I had in L.A were massive because it was in the states... ?? 

But the reason why my grade went down down down... is because of the ceviche that my friend and I shared.. OMG... it just tasted so funky... Ive definitely had better!!!!!! to me... this dish smelled like an old wet table cloth that had not been rung enough and ...the smell of damp linen just lingering with each taste of that ceviche... I thought it was just ME , but actually my friend thought it tasted funky too!! ruined my experience because it was the first dish... the taco helped it a bit.. but I wouldn't go all the way there for taco experience again. I'd like to try others in Toronto first!"}
{"text":"We wave adiós to those who are waiting hours to get seats.
As we leave the premises better off than when we stepped in earlier...
Leaving with wet feets, battle stains and happy bellies.

  Beef Cheek Taco($3.50) so cloying sweet. Lime me.
  Baja Fish Taco($3.50) is simply worth returning for, simply.
  Happy Bellies.

Rewind to the very beginning~~~~

  Why am I waiting outside? For how long?? Where am I?
  I'm not dressed for a hipster bar. I'm not even hipster-ish to begin with.
  I lean on locked gates at the shop next door trying to look cool and patient.
  As we look at patrons leaving and smiling at us for being suckers in waiting."}
{"text":"The hipster atmosphere is interesting, the tacos are better than La Carnita's, and the bourbon pairing is a nice unique touch. On the whole, this is the best taco joint in Toronto. Its only downside is its immense popularity - if you go there with a group during a typical meal time, you will likely be disappointed and turned away."}
{"text":"When you figure out which door opens to this place, you're welcomed by a small venue blasting good Ole hip-hop in the background. Expecting to be told the wait was rediculously long, we were actually able to be seated at the bar in 5 mins. The menu is small(which is how it should be really) and focuses on Mexican fare. The atmosphere is alive, and the cost of food and drink is pretty reasonable. I mean at 3.75 a taco, you can't go wrong.

I got the fish and chicken tacos and my friend got the yam and fried cauliflower tacos. They were perfect. Soft shell, well seasoned meat, crispy and sour slaw, made for an amazing taste bud dance in the mouth. By the time we were done, we spent 10minutes contemplating whether to get more or stay so satisfied as is - we got more drinks instead.

Service was great(kind of had to be since we were right at the bar), dessert was fantastic and all in all this was a time well worth the money spent.

Only downside was we would've liked some back support with the seating and would've stayed well into the night if that was the case. We are definitely going to be visiting and probably trying to taste all items off the menu"}
{"text":"True rating: 3.5. We arrived around 8 and there was a 30 minute wait. We tried to get a drink at the bar while we waited but we were told to wait outside. Ok, the place is small. The music was great but far too loud. Nevertheless, we Shazamed it all. The staff was a but too \"cool\" but what more can we expect from Parkdale. I was really peeved that they wouldn't replace my friend's cocktail when she accidentally spilled it before even taking a sip! Any good business owner knows that the cost of that extra drink is worth satisfying your (now angry) customer. Food was good. We had guacamole, pork and short rib tacos and crispy squid (which was a tad too crispy and overly sweet for my taste but my friend really enjoyed it). After all the hype about this place, though, I expected more. The menus are only on the wall so if you get a table next to the wall, get ready to crane that neck! Sure, I would return if I were in the neighborood and craving some tacos & guac."}
{"text":"What goes up must come down!
This place was great but the prices are going up, the service is going down and staffs heads no longer fit through the doors. Used to be worth the trek to Parkdale but not anymore. Plenty more tacos where that came from. Like I'm going to wait two hours on a wednesday after being told 20 minutes and get all kinds of attitude on top of it... Then have a server explain the concept of rotation to me... 
You have folding chairs. Bye."}
{"text":"Me and my brother stopped by here based on other recommendations here on Yelp, and it didn't disappoint.  Actually, this had to be one of the better Restaurants I have been to in Toronto.  We had the Octopus dish to start with a bunch of Tacos and it was very tasty.  Definitely gets full marks!"}
{"text":"I don't live close by but this place is worth the trek as long as you're prepared to splurge! The food gets 5 stars in my books but all other things taken into account I'm only giving three stars. 

To be completely honest the food is a redeeming factor at this place that has a lot to make up for.  It's an extremely crowded and loud environment. Don't go here on a first date where you hope to actually converse with your company. Unless of course you're going in the summer, their back patio is adorable and a way better atmosphere than inside.  Also the drink menu could be more accessible. They don't have physical menus except for their bourbon and everything is written on a chalkboard with dim lighting.. We had no idea they even had beer on tap and other things the first few times we went.  
The plates the tacos come on are a little ridiculous.  For something so messy you'd think we'd be given our own plate but you have to share your messy taco over a silver tin.  In my experience don't bother with some of the apps especially the chicken wings.  Overpriced and small portions. 
BEST TACO IS BAJA FISH... That taco alone keeps me coming back.. They are to die for. Pretty much any of the tacos won't disappoint you. 

I also don't dig that you can't split bills.... What? This is downtown Toronto.. Not everyone is a couple that can figure out the bill splitting later,  they have no sympathy for how annoying it is to stop the evening's events because now someone has to find their bank or atm to pay you back.  And it's really NOT that hard to divy it up on the till with the right software.  Seems like a really outdated way to process transactions."}
{"text":"Okay so Ive known and have been going to grand electric for a couple of years now and will just summarize.

it was better years ago, prices went up (i understand, minimum wage going up and all that) but the servings of the tacos.... A SINGLE CORN TORTILLA? Supposed to be double, fam. Ill take my business to Wilbur or Tacos 101! Years ago if I had left a review (2014-2016) it would have been 4 stars. However having gone 2 weeks ago it was nothing like I recalled, the sauces are different, the music is WAY too loud (trendy and hip I get it) and all i wanted to do was have a conversation and focus on my food. But with the blaring music I just wanted my shitty tacos, my shots and to get the fuck out. I guess thats what theyre going for? Gonna take some convincing or a very drunk me to go back in there! Grand Electric R.I.P in my books."}
{"text":"Definitely a fan!  I love coming here.  I've even introduced this place to several friends of mine.  

Cute atmosphere.  A bit on the loud side if you are inside. But the outdoor back patio in the summer is great. So pick outside first.  

One huge tip - get the Cerviche!  It's the best dish ever and it's the reason why I keep coming back here.

The tacos are amazing.  Reasonably price.  I really can't say which taco I like better as they are all so good.  

Make sure you check out the table spices.  Very tasty.  ALSO ask for some of their homemade salsa.  Last time i was in, they didn't offer this on the tables anymore so you have to ask for this now.  

There is one thing that I wished was still on the menu BUT you can still ask for it. The Smokey Bourbon Ceasar.  it's delicious.  You'll thank me for this later.

There is a bit of a wait sometimes with this place.  But it's worth the wait.  There's been many times that I just put my name on the list and grab a drink nearby to come back.  It really is my favourite place to go in Parkdale."}
{"text":"This place is great but the music is always obnoxiously loud.  With more and more great taco options in the city I find myself going here less and less."}
{"text":"Have heard great things. Came on a Wednesday night. Ordered a mushroom taco. Got sick. Grand rejectric."}
{"text":"Taco and bourbon. What else can you ask for? Always packed. Summer is your best bet given their patio doubles the capacity. But they will take your name and text you when the table is ready - and there are tons of places to drink while you wait. 

Must get the guac & chips and whatever taco filing you desire and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Recently checked this place out after another Mexican food craving. Quite a small space but had a cool vibe to it. Staff is very friendly although we did experience a long wait for our server to take our orders. We ate here for Sunday lunch and got lucky that there wasn't a line when we arrived. Tables are very tiny and leaves you with minimal elbow room. All that aside, food was so good!! We had various types of tacos along with a quesadilla and their nachos platter, none disappointed but our nacho chips were on the salty side. Prices are quite high but would definitely eat here again. Come here for a snack but don't come on an empty stomach as it will cost you a lot to satisfy your hunger."}
{"text":"Seen a few popular blogs talk about this place so I had to try it out although it's kinda out of the way as I work in the DT core. As well, it's in the Parkdale area where my fellow foodie was not fond of.

Anywho, got there at 5:55pm and there was a couple that just got there 10 seconds before us, so we queued casually until we noticed more people start showing up, then we formed a professional lineup to avoid any confusion. 

By the time we got in 6pm (it's opening) it was 95% full, quite surprised!

On to the food.

Pojole Rojo (soup) - had a strong pulled pork smell so that's all I thought it would be but the taste was very different then anything I had, it was very good and comforting on cold cold day. Also came with pickled chili's which is insanely spicy, would recommend people to taste a small piece first. 

Tacos
Chicken - wasn't as spicy as I expected, was good but not blown away.
Pulled pork - was expecting to be blown away as other mentioned, it was definitely very god but super impressed.
Beef cheek - surprisingly the beef cheek was my favorite, I could probably be happy with just chicken and beef cheek.

Nacho + Guac - very fresh, I've had my fair share of nacho's and this one tasted very fresh as I'm told it is made in house. It's not too hard or has that preservatives taste. 

Drinks
Grand Electric Sour - Was surprisingly refreshing however the lemon taste was getting to me towards the end but I'm not a cocktail kinda guy so in the future I'll just get a draft beer. 

Michelada - beer Cesar, surprisingly good as well, would recommend if someone wants a drink with a kick. 

Tips
- go early cause there is only two 2 seaters so you'll end up at the bar if you're not lucky enough to get it
- good amount of nachos come with the Pojole Rojo large so you can save some guac if you get the nacho+guac before hand"}
{"text":"My friend and I dropped by this spot during our short food trip in Toronto. I had selected this spot based on its awesome reviews and I would have to say that I was not disappointed. The place is located on the side of Queens St, with a neon sign outside. Although it is a tad small and tight spaced inside, it was very well-decorated with interesting artwork on the walls and ceiling. For food, we had the crispy cauliflower, beef cheeks, pork carnitas, and baja fish tacos. All were absolutely delicious. The service was great. It was hard for me to pick which of the tacos I had was my favorite. I would have to say the braised beef cheeks were cooked and seasoned to perfection. It had a very sweet and savory taste. I could say the same for the pork carnitas which was juicy and tender with pork fat. Although the tacos looked quite small, the flavors definitely made up for it. A tad above average per taco, but I would have to say their tacos are definitely worth a try. I was very pleased with the options and quality of the food. Overall, would definitely come back to try out the other options on the menu."}
{"text":"I could even say this is a 3.5 Star restaurant.

I've heard so much about Grand Electric and how amazing the tacos are, but while good, I didn't think they were great.

Baja fish taco - 3.5/5

Shrimp taco - 3.5/5

Pork belly taco - 4/5

Atmosphere - 3.5/5. Do not recommend coming here with a large group. Even with 2, I felt rather squishy with the tables next to us. I didn't find noise was a problem, but we came on an early Sunday evening (5pm ish) and there was a snow storm outside which I'm guessing deterred some people from going out.

Service - 3/5. Server was kind of hard to flag down when we needed her, but otherwise, service was okay. Nothing else notable.

Overall, the meal was good but didn't think it was great."}
{"text":"It's official. I don't understand the hype around this whole gastro-taco thing.

Tried a lot of the menu and wasn't really floored by any of it. From the Miami Ribs (thin cut beef ribs), Tuna Ceviche, Street Corn (which was what amazed me the most at La Carnita), or any of the tacos. The beef taco was cilantro overkill. The spicy chicken taco admittedly tasted okay going down but the lingering hotness was a bit extreme. The pork belly was the best of the bunch, but still didn't knock my socks off by any means.
We tried both the key lime and chocolate pecan desserts and like the rest of the meal, it was good, but not necessarily impressive.

One thing I will hand this place is they do have a nice patio. The only downside is communal eating tables. There is nothing like being sprayed with corn juice as someone you aren't even dining with bites into their food.
This was a 3 star experience at best."}
{"text":"Best tacos in town!

After our first visit here, we knew this was a place worth coming back to. We've tried other tacos in the city since, but we came back craving knowing these are the best.

Have the Baja Fish taco if you want something light and fresh, or go for the Beef Cheek and Pork Belly tacos if you want a whole lot of flavour. Order a side of chips and dip - you get a lot and plenty to share.

The quesadillas are basically the taco versions with cheese cooked in - wouldn't recommend as you can get 2 tacos for the price of one of these.

Minus 1 star as the service is a little slow, especially paying by card, since there seems to be only one machine. However, the wait for the food is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Spicy chicken tacos were on point! Beet and avocado tostadas were delicious but for $3.50 each a little over priced. The atmosphere is awesome and the Bourbonaid is amazing! Definitely worth a try if your nearby. I'm from the states and this place was great but if your hungry and want to eat & drink without spending over $40 for lunch this isn't a place I would recommend - the portions are super small."}
{"text":"Really good freaking tacos.  There's a Yelp truth here.  When hundreds of people say a place has really good freaking tacos, you don't really need to be reading this review to confirm or deny that.  If i said there WEREN'T good tacos, I clearly have some way overblown standard for tacos, or burned my tongue in an accident and don't taste the same way as most of society.  If you're reading this just to confirm one last time where the best tacos are, there are really good freaking tacos here.  Tacos. Here. Eat them. They're so good. Yum."}
{"text":"A Huge selection of bourbons wrapped up in a taco joint....seriously I'm moving in!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Not a sit down date place because of the loudness and quick dining time.  But man...the food is good!  I always bite off more than I can chew when ordering their delicious tacos, but that's not a bad thing someone will eat it.  Bourbon, obscure beers, loud 90s rap, did I die and go to heaven?  A little dramatic but I must say it's different and I like it.  Also helps that it is around the corner from where I live.  I hear lines can be a pain, but I have actually never experienced a wait time.  Get there early and you're all good.  Favourites are the beef cheek, pig tail and fish tacos and the guac with chips.  I tried one of their famous caesars and let me tell you it was spicy.  Try if you dare, but I wasn't going to order another.  I may just go tonight!"}
{"text":"I was greeted by loud, blaring Kid Cudi music when I walked in. The restaurant was dimly lit with exposed walls and a wall sized chalkboard with the menu written on it. Very hipster. Overall, the tacos were very flavourful and they were absolutely delicious. The best part is that the tacos are $3.60 each and you can pretty much try all of their tacos without breaking your bank account. I will definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Fish taco's are off the hook. Really nice Bourbon cocktail on the menu also. Pretty tough to get in but worth the wait. The backyard patio has picnic tables a cool vibe."}
{"text":"Do NOT ever go here!! The reviews are not equivalent to the dining experience. 
If I could post less than one star I would. 
Completely dissatisfied with the customer service and everything about this place. 
I came in with two friends. I was surprised at how small the place was but it seemed quaint. The music was very loud however but regardless it seemed fine to sit and eat. 
I came from class and was excited to eat as I hadn't had a chance to eat today. 
We ordered drinks (which seemed very over priced for the area). They came very quickly. 
We then ordered food. The two people I was with are adventurous eaters and ordered quickly. Whereas I just wanted a classic taco and I did not see one on the menu, I inquired as to have a chicken taco with ice burg lettuce, tomato and cheese. The server responded they couldn't do such an order. 
My friends and I were confused. We asked if they were pre made, which would explain why they couldn't do it. The server told us they were fresh to order. We still didn't understand. 
The server told us that she couldn't do it because the chef would not make anything other than what was on the menu. No substitutions. Nothing on the side. No changes. 
I'm sorry, but that seems rather ridiculous. I was not a fan of certain items on the menu. Maybe I'm just a picky eater and that's my fault but I have never been to an establishment of any sort where they could not assist me. Regardless I am not paying for something Where i will not enjoy or cannot eat. 
They would rather I starve than change or substitute anything about their items. I'm sorry but isn't the customer always right? Or at least are you not here to keep your consumers happy?
I should be able to substitute anything on my dish, for another item that is in their restaurant.. I don't and didn't even mind paying an extra cost and made that very aware. 
I was not even able to request the toppings to be put on the side so I could put it together. 
Completely ridiculous. 
Long story short, drinks and food are completely over priced. According to my friends who I was dining with the food that they did order was not good. It came in small portions, was beyond spicy and the toppings it did come with did NOT go together. Sorry chef. 
If you want real Mexican food that is worth the price go to El Catrin. Better food, drinks, service and atmosphere. 
Regardless anything in Toronto is better than here. Readers be warned."}
{"text":"The place was pretty cool. Not a lot of space but it didn't feel too cramped either. Offered a decent number of food choices and an extensive selection of drinks.

Tried the pork carnitas and spicy chicken tacos which were pretty good (didn't like the shells though). Also had the spicy squid topped with guacamole which is my favourite item here so far. Definitely recommend a taste.

Overall pretty good experience would definitely recommend to others."}
{"text":"Thought this may be like a lot of hip-at-the-moment places, more sass than substance which is common for the Toronto scene. But there is something substantial here. Tacos. Some very tasty tacos. Not SD or Tijuana level but surprisingly good. Overpriced but not for the Toronto market. Service is a bit spotty given the crowds but the place has a nice vibe and energy. I think the take-no-BS servers may throw some people off though. The crazy lines and debit/cash situation also add to the \"attitude\" labels but that may float your boat"}
{"text":"Great food, good service and limited seating. It was about a 40 minute wait to get in, but worth it. The seating area is small and loud, but the delicious food makes the wait and cramped space worth it. Definitely check this place out, every dish we ate was very good."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the decor and ambiance of this poor institution. 

Our waitress were being moody the night we went in. I felt a little bit of negativity when I was speaking to them. It was like speaking to a teenage girl who has better things to do than help my friends and I get some tacos. 

I had the Baja Fish Tacos, Tuna Belly Tostada, and the Potted Caramel. 

The Baja Fish Taco was ok. The tortilla was thick with fried fish and cabbage mixture. I had to remove a layer of the tortilla because it overpowered the bland tasting fish and cabbage. The last bite left drips of oil running down my hand, yuck!

The Tuna Belly Tostada was the size of an American Half-Dollar. It was heavy on the sauce with no hint of tuna belly with the single bite I had. 

The star of the night was the Potted Caramel. It was delicious. Get it. There is nothing bad about it. 

I don't recommend anyone going there because of the service, I was not welcomed. There are other places near with delicious food and great service. If you happen to end up here only go for dessert and leave immediately after."}
{"text":"I'd say 5 stars for tacos in Toronto, but having spent some time at California's best beach side taco stands I've got to give 4 stars overall... but that said totally worth a trip to Parkdale!

I love places that do small menus and do them well! We went on Oscar night at 10:30pm so there wasn't a wait but we did have to share a table so I'm guessing there's usually a wait.

I had the fortune of going with a few foodie friends and pretty much trying everything on the menu.

Let's start with the starters... My favorite starter was the ceviche, even though i don't really eat seafood. The crispy tortilla and fried shallots around the ceviche was the perfect addition of flavour and texture to the fresh lime and fish. The only thing I could have done without was the mayo like dressing but all in all it was still delicious! 

The spicy squid was also very enjoyable for a non-seafood eater like myself, all the seafood dishes were very fresh, not at all fishy. Personally, I could have done without the mayo on most of them but I imagine I'm in the minority. The spicy chicken sauce was a tangy, sweet, spicy, sour mix, it reminded me of a Thai dressing. I'm not sure chicken wings made the most sense because the sauce made the skin a bit soggy and it was a bit messy to eat even though tacos are messy too I guess... but tasty, sooo tasty....

Now for the tacos! Braised beef cheek, yum! Pork belly & pineapple al pastor, yum! Spicy chicken, yum! Fish taco, yum! Though the fish taco was a little greasy... Still amazing. There were two other tacos on the menu but I forget their names and can't find them online.

My favourite was probably the beef cheek followed shortly by the pork belly, I love pineapple in tacos!

Oh and maybe two tortillas per taco would be better for stability?

Again, all in all, very good tacos. 

Dessert, the lime dessert was like key lime pie in a pot. It was cute and delicious but the chocolate pecan was by far the best! I don't think they have it all the time so if you see it, get it!

The chocolate mousse was the perfect texture and the pecans had a slight sweet toasted glaze that made them a bit crunchy but not a stick to your teeth coating. The base was a white, slightly sour curd? It wasn't as good as the rest but all in all it was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Forgive me all for what I am about to say, but Grand Electric is NOT worth the try, not even if they offer you a seat right away, not even if the wait line is 1 second. I know, I know, look at all this stunning great reviews, right? Well, this is my humble opinion...

1. Overpriced for what you get, I you all know I am not one to cheap out on food.
2. They do not take credit or debit cards
3. Comunal tables are more like smaller tables for 4 where they sit 6 and you elbow a person all the time
4. service is below average, the hype has created monsters out of them. As though we should thank them for letting us come sit and elbow with strangers and eat the bad food they serve.
5. Unless your vocal cords are that strong, you will come out of there feeling like you just been at a nightclub...the music is that loud!
5. and probably the MOST important -  their tacos are one note flavours and/or lack there of. I had the tuna ceviche tostada and it tasted like tuna dipped in mayo and vinegar. The only taco that saved the day was the pastor style. But even then, I have had better in Kensington market area.

Unfortunately, not wishing you all a Buen Provecho! but more of a Good luck!

Viviana."}
{"text":"TACOS!!!!!! Nice crowd, good drinks and great tacos. What else do you need for a good night? The service can be a little slow but the place gets slammed. Sitting at the bar in the back is also not a bad option if it's a nice night."}
{"text":"Found the baja fish great, but over all very small portions.  Only tried the tacos, which did taste amazing, but pretty expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Just so awesome. Great food, great vibe, feels like in mexico. 
Delicious margaritas. Delicious food. Perfect ! I will go back."}
{"text":"Randomly decided to grab a quick lunch here while I was in the area on a Sunday afternoon. I know this place is quite popular, but luckily I came at one of their slower periods (around 2-3pm?).

On the recommendation of a server, I ordered the Cochinta pibil (roast pork) and then tried the Fish taco and Pork Belly. 
The Cochinta was definitely my favourite..the roast pork was tender and soft. The Fish Taco had a yummy crispy fish piece but if ordered I would recommend you eating it first as shell will get soggy from the sauces on it. The Pork Belly taco was not really my favourite... a bit too sweet for me with their pineapple toppings. 

I would come here again though, good to dine with friends and family. More for groups of 4 or less if you don't have reservations. Though they have a picnic table in front by the windows that can fit 6."}
{"text":"Came in on a Tuesday night around 7pm and the place was full, but lucked out and got some seats at the bar.  

This place is LOUD (music) - don't expect to have a great conversation with anyone whose ears aren't licking distance from yours..

Food: The fish taco was ahh-mazing (delicately fried exterior, melty center - drool..), though I found the pork belly and spicy chicken tacos to be pretty good though not earth shattering.  The house brew on tap (Electric draught) was really smooth - and not *too* bad at $6.75.  Brussel sprouts with chorizo were surprisingly good (and this is from a guy who doesn't really like brussel sprouts), as were the nachos with guaca - though the guaca was slightly flat.

Service: was decent - only negative was that they bring you your tacos on communal plates, but we thought they served each person what they ordered.  Especially since there were no side plates provided.  So there was a bit of a mix-up here but no harm done as we caught it before the first person that got a plate of tacos ate them all, assuming they were theirs.

Verdict: great food, good service, high side of average in terms of price, so-so atmosphere (did I mention loud?), hipster vibe (yes, I saw plaid shirts, thick rimmed glasses, and tarp grommet earrings).. Do it at least once - though if doing tacos, stick with the fish ones.."}
{"text":"Finally made my way to this spot.  It has been on my hit list for awhile but now I can scratch it off.  Love the atmosphere, decor, music, and all around attitude of the place.  It is small but leave your name and number and they will send a courtesy text she a table is ready.

We got the Baja, scrapple, beef shoulder, spicy chicken tacos.  Along with that we got Guac and a poblano popper.  They have bourbon shot specials and their drinks are wicked.  I ordered the GE sour and it was amazing!

All in all definitely a solid taco place that I will check out next time in Parkdale."}
{"text":"I ordered: Most of the tacos on the menu + Mojito + Chicken wings + Octopus + Coconut desert ~ $70 (tip + tax included) for 2 people

Recommendation: Great place, do not hesitate to come. If you go with a bro, sit at the bar table and if come with a SO, sit at the table. The reason is because the music was very loud (I liked it) so my bro and I was had to awkwardly come very closed to talk to each other. Too intimate!

+1 Price vs portion: no complain

Taste + food presentation + drink : (+1) Typical mexican food and presentation that you pretty much find everywhere. (-1) drink because I expected a tequila bar and a wider cocktail selection. Instead it was a whiskey bar and classic cocktails that you can make at home.

+ 1  Comfortable place to eat + customer service

+1 Wow! Cool vibe and well-designed place"}
{"text":"Went twice after all the hype about the place and found the tacos to be over priced and tiny portioned...spent $65 and wasn't full so went to nearest poutine place to get a decent meal...never coming back to this posh place"}
{"text":"Just ordered  delivery after learning from a emergency nurse that Grand Electric had this option!
Came in about 10 mins (can't beat that!) and with drawings and notes on the takeout containers (cute).
Now on to the food.  We ordered one of everything, all was great.  Standouts were the pork belly, scrapple and crispy baja fish.

Can't wait to try electric mudd"}
{"text":"One of the coolest spots I've ever been. They play awesome old school hip hop with a bar feel to the atmosphere. The margaritas are on point! The chips n guac are nice as well. I had the delight of having the Baja Fish Tacos and devoured them. Awesome taste with the hot sauce on the table. See you next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Honestly, pretty hit or miss but the drinks are always good! I get the Rosemary's Baby and GE Sour (?). I also like their patio. 
Been here a bunch of times - I like the specials usually. The tuna belly tostada was pretty good; had some octopus dish once that was delish too. 

Cauliflower taco was hard and chewy rather than being a lightly fried texture. Kale salad was so salty and had too much lemon so it was almost inedible. Beef Cheek taco doesn't have much flavour. Fish taco is sometimes well-fried, other times its overcooked and dry."}
{"text":"I deducted a few stars here because a server (tall dirty blond hair collette) I've had twice now here is one of the most un-interested, straight faced, person I've ever had! She genuinely doesn't seem like she wants to be there, much less take your order, which is unfortunate :( 

The tacos are delicious but that service totally ruined my experience."}
{"text":"I friggin' love restaurants that specialize in a specific type of food, like poutine*, burgers, booze (all bars) AND tacos. This one was truly a delightful experience.

We had Pork, Chicken, and Beef tacos each were yummy in their own way and all tasted super different. The chicken taco was so spicy I had to take off my Christmas sweater at one point and order another beer. Despite that I couldn't stop eating it. It even has a medium dusting of cheese on top of it. 

I'd recommend stopping by for a dinner and trying out some of the fantastic drink selection and don't forget dessert, I had the Drank Nog and it was fantastic. Pricing was reasonable and I left full but not taco coma full.

All of that on top of a lovely staff. I gave it four stars as I wasn't aching to go back** but would GLADLY go there if I were in parkdale.

*I like poutine.
**I live a good bit away from parkdale."}
{"text":"I went here on recommendation of Marie. F. and was totally impressed.  It ranks among the top places I'd choose to go for an evening of food or drinks whether with friends or on a date.

After going here a first time with my lady, I immediately returned with the boys; my jealous lady even requested that I bring a few of their delicious tacos back home for her.

The main restaurant plays hip music, and in the summer, when the back patio is operating, the ambiance is a little quieter, but well nicely illuminated.  I've enjoyed both.

The smells looming tantalize the senses.  We wanted to try everything on the menu.  

And after two visits, I pretty much had.  I think I would hold on the scrapple taco next time, just because its brain, but everything we tried was amazingly delicious.  The tacos are all worth trying as they have very unique flavour combinations.  My favs were the chicken, pork and beef.  You have to try one of each if anything!

Both times I went I had the Bourbon-aid, which I find compliments both the food, my palette, and the overall experience.  I'm already looking forward to my next visit... In fact, just thinking about those tacos is making me hungry!"}
{"text":"After all the hype of  a new hipster restaurant, I went on a Saturday night with managed expectations and was blown away. Amazing tacos, and very friendly service considering we were a big group with 2 babies. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of tacos, and Grand Electric had been on my list for a long time. I finally got around to trying it, and am a little disappointed.

For the price you pay, the tacos are TINY. I needed 3 tacos and chicken wings to fill me up. The service was average, and the space was small. We had to wait about 15 minutes for a 2-person table on a Tuesday evening.

Go to Seven Lives in Kensington instead (only downside there is, not seating room). You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos every time. The location is usually pretty noisy but its all good because MY MOUTH EXPLODES WITH FLAVOUR WHENEVER I EAT ONE OF THEIR TACOS. My favourite is the baja fish taco. Yum!"}
{"text":"Tacos! Who doesn't like tacos ^^  This place has a nice little setup if you're in the mood to drink while having delicious Mexican food. Every taco on the menu is worth trying. Their tuna ceviche and spicy squid is pretty damn good too. They also have a patio and seating is limited so make reservations or arrive early~"}
{"text":"Waiting 3 hours To eat a Taco is not my idea of a good night.  Any place that is overhyped , I avoid, but I was with a group so no choice"}
{"text":"We ordered through Ûber Eats. 

Got the Baja fish, pork belly, and shrimp tacos along with a kale Caesar salad. 

At just over $40 price tag we weren't even close to full as the tacos were quite small although quite tasty. The salad was however not very good.  The dressing wasn't very good and the salad was quite dry."}
{"text":"IN SUM: Overrated. No idea why this place is known for their tacos, but fantastic drinks and apps.

RESTAURANT: It was an extremely hot evening, so we sat inside. Restaurant is rustic, funky done nice and done right. Beautiful. We were seated at a communal table (no problem!) on benches that we awkwardly close to the window and hard on the tooshie. Pretty uncomfortable, actually. Music was good but a little too loud. 

DRINKS: Excellent. $8 a pop. Tried every single one. Very pretty. Very strong. Very, very  tasty. Get the BOURBANADE. 

GUACAMOLE - Served with chips and fried pig skin; also came with a very spicy salsa. Very, very good, but as someone that makes a mean guacamole all by her ownsome, I struggle paying $8 for the dish at a restaurant. 

CORN -  Sweet delicious corn so juicy we were spraying each other in the face when we bit in; sloshed with tangy mayo, smoky chipotle spice and sprinkled with cheese. Unexpected favourite of the night. Don't question it, just  ORDER IT.

BEEF CHEEK TACO - Pretty good, but the meat wasn't tender and the peppers on top were misleading: it was not spicy at all. Corrected this by dousing it in their delicious green salsa. Much better. 

PORK BELLY TACO - Okay, but too sweet, and the meat wasn't tender. Once again, doused it in green salsa, which was an improvement. 

BAJA FISH TACO - Didn't try it, but my friend said it was very good. 

The tacos are dissapointing, but throw back a couple of bourbanades and you won't give a damn."}
{"text":"I had a great time here last night.  Tried a good 60% of their menu.  Here are my likes and dislikes:

Faves:
- Pork tinga taco (full of flavour and the pork really shines in this dish)
- Beef cheek taco (the meat was really tender)
- Chips and guac (the guac was amazing but the salsa was the bomb!!)
- Fish taco (a long piece if lightly battered fried fish - not oily at all - with amazing toppings)
- Spicy squid (their creamy sauce and chili pepper combo on the bed of fried squid was OMG good)
- Key lime dessert (just the best way to cap off this amazing meal)

Not a Fan: 
- Cactus taco (the texture was all wrong and I found it rather bland)
- Scrapple taco (it was way too sweet.  FYI, it is a patty made of beef face meats)
- Miami ribs (way too sweet)

I've been told to expect long lines here.  We got there 15 minutes after they opened (i.e. 6:15pm) and it was already packed.  If it wasn't for a party moving from their table to the bar, we would have waited for an hour. 

Expect to pay about $50 per person (tax and tip included).  That included three shared apps (guac & chips, spicy squid and miami ribs), 5 tacos per person, 1 shared dessert and 1 cocktail."}
{"text":"The ceviche at this place was really good. I hadn't had ceviche in over a year..since my trip to Costa Rica where I gorged on it day and night....I had forgotten how much I like this dish. I'm so glad to have the option in Toronto of an above average ceviche. The rest of the items we ordered were very forgettable...nothing to write home about. 

I'd definitely hit this place up again though I'm sure I'll be able to find better ceviche in Toronto once I start looking for it."}
{"text":"Ok so lets talk about Grand Electric. This place is definitely \"poppin\" as they would say. Any time I have been the wait has been up and up 1-3 hours. They send you off to get drunk somewhere else if you have to wait that long, but the funny thing is .... People do! And you know why? Because the food is that frikken good! The scrapple taco is hands down the bee's knees! It's so buttery and delicious!!! I get it every time. The Baja tacos is massive and the pork belly is unreal too!  The atmosphere is dope, it has a good vibe. The staff is casually dressed like hipster nation and the booze is always flowing. Drinks are not more pricey but that's because the food is so god damn cheap! Now be careful and don't get your self kicked out now.... What do I mean by this? Well one night me and my gf were on a mission to eat tacos and get wasted . So we had a pitcher (which are massive by the way in these cool ass jars) and start eating food. We finished eating but continued to drink, finished the pitcher had a couple shots and a cocktail, they asked us if we were done eating and we said we weren't sure. Then suddenly the bill gets dropped off. I said we weren't ready to pay and the bar tender told is that because we aren't eating anymore we have to settle up because they are on a wait !?!? I was epically disappointed at this because my drinks cost more then my food and our bill was over $100! We got booted out and couldn't even order another taco if we tried. I told one of my friends about this and she gave me a good tip. Eat very very slowly. Lol despite this happening I have learned my lesson and now know what to do next time but it doesn't stop me from going back again and again!!"}
{"text":"I couldn't imagine a much worse DINE IN experience; packed, body to body, music too loud, conversations battling overly loud conversations. Supposedly the back patio is much nicer..  On take out, copped tude for not tipping. 
Why do we seemingly have to be asked to TIP for everything now?! It's expensive enough to grab take out or a latte, etc..  Love to see more progressive employers paying the employees decent wages and not constantly begging for EXTRA. 
spicy chicken tacos very good!"}
{"text":"Yes, this place is worth the wait...even if it is raining on a saturday night, even if you have to wait two hours, even if you are starving..... Here is how you can plan your nit around it.
1. Pick a night the hockey game is on.
2. Go and put your name down and walk over to the rhino across the street
3. Sit at the bar and order a few of the 356 beers ...Subject to season and availability.
4. Enjoy your company and wait for the call
5. Pay your bill and head over for a fantastic meal.

We got sat the the bar.. Small and busy, rest liveliness. The waitress is quick to get your order and tempting you to get the guacamole because youve been waiting so long....simply oblige and be satisfied when lovely plate of Guac and chips come out with a piece of crispy pork. I wasn't sure what all the hype was about this but the guacamole is creamy with little bits and the perfect amount of acidity. If you can avoid sharing the piece of pork, keep it to yourself.

We ordered two types of tacos.. Chicken and fish. All I have to say is..get the fish. Large piece of seafood that is perfectly cooked and full of substance and flavours. Every bite tastes amazing and I wanted more. The chicken was delicious as well... Nothing disappointed, just preferred the fish more!

I had waited this long.... So decided to get the tuna ceviche to top it off. Large chunks of tuna drizzled with lemon juices and other saucy goodness. S is not a big ceviche fan so more for me!!! There were some chips at the bottom you can combine with so it gives you more textures if you do not want to eat it solely by itself.

To end, the key lime pie...very creamy, but loaded with citrus. Definitely lived up to S's expectations... Oh one more thing... If you like sours like me, the electric sour will be your kind of drink."}
{"text":"Small hipster-y place with little tacos full of favour. The beef cheek and crispy cauliflower are delicious. Careful as they do not split bills. They also do not seat until your entire party had physically arrived. We were missing one person from our party of 4 and they would not sit even though there were empty tables and we wanted to order cocktails while waiting."}
{"text":"On a Saturday night this place was buzzing, and we had a 25 minute wait for a table. The guacamole was good, although not spectacular, and some of the chips were a little soft. The tacos were great - the shrimp was mild and the fish had a great kick. Friends had the beef also and enjoyed them. The place itself is pretty small, so you need to not mind virtually sitting in the lap of the folks at the next table. Would definitely consider another visit"}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to us by a local.  It was affordable and delicious.  The atmosphere was fun and the staff was friendly.  Since the tacos were reasonably priced, we tried one of every kind of the six tacos on the menu.  Our favorites were the beef and the scrapple, but all of them were delicious.  The guacamole and chips were excellent as well.  Highly recommended!  We would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Lots of oriental flavors going on in this taco joint. 

To start, we sampled the chips with dips, the \"fried onions\" were very interesting (think onions pickled in soy sauce), beans were re-fried beans while the gauc and salsa tasted exactly as you would imagine. 

For my main entree I had 3 tacos, the Baja fish, pork carnitas and the beef cheek. The Baja fish was my favorite, crispy fried fish served with lime mayo (only Mexican tasting taco). The beef cheek taste just like the sweet Asian spice mix beef my grandmother makes which was definitely a new take on beef tacos. The pork carnitas were moist, I mean you can't go wrong with carnitas.

I was a little bummed about the service though, I had to wave down the waiters several times for water or just to ask a question."}
{"text":"Great food, but OMFG, you will go deaf in this place.
I asked a guy to turn down the volume and he said he would, but only a teeny tiny bit since it would alter the \"vibe\".  I am no old fart, but the only reason I can think of any trendy resto to have music THAT loud is to get people in and out as fast as possible.

Tacos eaten: pork, beef cheeks, scrapple, fish -- all fresh and fantastic.

Brussel sprouts and chorizo: started out well, but towards the middle of the bowl, it got to sweet and mushy to continue enjoying.

Spicy squid: tender, juicy, not too spicy rings of squid on top of a fried tortilla.  My favorite thing on the menu.

Waited an hour across the street to get seated.  Ate in 35 minutes or so. 
Did I mention how LOUD it was in there?"}
{"text":"Overall we enjoyed our meal.  Staff were great.  Décor was simple and comfortable.  There is limited seating so can may be lineups to get in at some points in the dinner timeframe.

The tacos were  also good value for the price.  We did note the 'no modifications' policy, which was a bit of a problem for the fussy eater in our party.  

They had a decent selection of beers, including the Grant Electric which I tried and enjoyed.

Overall our experience was positive.  

Would return:  Not likely - we don't live in this area, so there are tons of other options to explore.   I didn't walk out going \"we have to come back!\"
Would I recommend:  I think it's a great joint for those in the neighbourhood.  Solid good food for a reasonable price with table service."}
{"text":"All the fizzle and sizzle seemed to have died down a bit. I can't say I frequent this place as it's been nearly impossible to get a seat most of the time. But I have had my chances and have been lucky to visit about handful of times in the past 2 years. I must admit I did buy into all that hype a few years back and was impressed at first but as my taco taste buds have developed greater experience I am starting to become a little too snobby for this place I suppose.

The tacos are dry and I am hoping it's just a bad batch as of late. I don't recall them being this dry when I first visited a few years back. Pork belly dry, beef dry, fish... okay that wasn't dry but the taco shells are dry, dry, dry. I know, taco shells are supposed to be dry but I doubt they should be dry to the point where it sticks to the sides of your mouth if you don't chew them. Probably caused by the generous flour dusting on the shells as it touches your mouth forms a \"dough\" consistency thereby sticking to your mouth.

The flavours are strong but somehow lacks complexity. There seems to be a flavour imbalance of some sort. This is more of a fusion take on Mexican flavours as there are obvious Asian/local flare. All in all, I was quite disappointed to say the least. The last 2-3 visits have been more and more disappointing."}
{"text":"Tacos were excellent, service was good.
Nachos were kinda meh, and so were the drinks. 
The drinks were around $10, and the fact that I didn't taste the alcohol, or wonder if it even had any, made me a little upset.

3 stars seems a little low for this establishment, but it's merely for the wait outside, but what can you do, it's a small place, with great food.
Would come back, and maybe order some shots or a beer next time instead."}
{"text":"Grand electric is definitely one of those hidden gems of toronto! 

I love the patio in the back, the fish tacos are not the best I've ever had but there definitely good!. I recommend going early though, every time I've gone there was always a long wait... after 5 expect atleast 40mins-1hour."}
{"text":"We loved this place!! Thank you Yelp and all your reviewers. We were in the area and used your app to make our decision . Great late lunch. Beef Cheek, shrimp and pork carnitas taco. We had to try the tempura squid tostadas . Glad we did. The aioli sauce and jalapeño peppers balanced each other . The Pork carnitas had a lime cilantro initial flavor, then the pork flavors kicked in at the back of your mouth. Loved the Beef Cheeks taco. The brown sugar and savory flavors swirled in our mouth. The shrimp taco was very tasty. The Grand Electric Ale washed all the tacos down. The staff were so so helpful. We sat at the bar and received a lot of attention from the staff . Kudos .
Can't wait until we're in the area again . 
Thank you Grand Electric and Yelp."}
{"text":"The line wasn't too bad but got longer. While in line some grubby grub who doesn't know grub tottered by and informed the crowd in line \"you can get just as good food at Taco Bell\".

Anyway, they've got a small but glorious-on-a-summer-day patio out back. The smells of the various meats cooking away is inciting.

The bottled beer selection is nice, microbrews from the US west coast and stuff.

I had the Liberty Ale, which hales from San Fran, not Liberty Village. It was decent bottle.

The tacos are $3.50 although they are actually quite small. Might take 4 to properly fill you. They're all quite flavorful, although I'd like to have seen a slightly bigger portion size as well as a double taco bed, not a single.

Service is top notch. The nachos make for a great starter. I didn't like the super puffy pork rind but the guacamole was good. And I hates the stuff normally.

All 'n' all I'd say this place would be amazing if $3.50 got you a bigger taco."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place by word of mouth, I had to come here.  I've been a pretty big fan of what the guys here had done at the Black Hoof, so I had to go and see what they were up to.

Word of warning, the place isn't exactly the biggest place in the world and apparently everyone in Toronto wants to come here as well.  Come early for a seat cause they go like lightning (or... electricity... [i know... awesome pun]).  We got there at 6:10 the night of a blizzard, and we were pretty much the last people that they seated.  This place doesn't take reservations so definitely get here when it opens or be prepared to wait.

The bar menu is pretty extensive, and when I mean extensive, I mean that they have pretty much a million types of whiskeys, bourbons and scotches.  Following the Black Hoof's philosophy that vodka pretty much sucks, they stock their walls with spirited brown bottles and offer them in shots, mixes and on rocks.  

I ordered the Grand Electric Sour thanks to reading Kent P. 's review and was not disappointed.  You'll see them making these vanilla infused wild turkey, lemon juice, egg white delights in multiple batches as they're pretty popular.  And ya, I would order them over and over.  Kinda reminds me of orange julius.

As for the menu, it's constantly changing, but the theme remains the same.  The tacos are served tapas style, and you pretty much order them one by one.  They come in 3 inch flour tortillas and are filled with your options of pig tail, baja fish, beef cheek, shrimp etc.  I pretty much ordered the entire menu and found that the pork belly was probably one of my favorite tacos there.  The other ones weren't letdowns either.  At 3 dollars per taco, you'll find yourself ordering pretty much everything just to try the menu out.

As a note, I did hear the guacamole was amazing, and did see the giant dipping dish come out (fyi, it's not small), but sadly, I'm allergic to the green stuff so I can't comment on it...  

While this probably isn't the best taco I've had (see my review for Tres Carnales in Edmonton), it's by far the best taco place in Toronto.  Hands down.  Even with the wait, I will definitely come back here again, and again, and again.  And then a couple more times after that.  I'd like the left side of the menu please."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. I love the food, I love the brown liquor, I love the margaritas, I love the loud rap music. The food is awesome, and it's FUN. Grand Electric makes me happy. I would live here if I could. Can't wait to go again. LOVE!!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's all the hype, but I felt completely underwhelmed when I went to Grand Electric the other night.

We had the baja fish tacos which everyone raves about. Personally I found them just okay. After that it was all down hill. The mission wings looked great but were bland and tough. Even the guac and chips were so-so. The guacamole was flavourless and the chips, although they had a nice lively lime zing to them, were way too greasy. I love Mexican cuisine and Grand Electric just did not do it for me. 

The food is cheap for a very good reason. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Loved it!

Cute little mexi-resto oozing Parkdale cool. At 8 on a Sat it was a 1-to-1.5 hour wait (we gave our name/number and grabbed a glass of wine at Porzia...thankfully there are no shortage of places to drink while biding your time in this neighbourhood). Just factor the wait into your plans and you should be okay.

Be forewarned: the tacos come over-stuffed with toppings and accoutrement. But that's some finger licking goodness right there!

Pork belly taco - AWESOME

Baja fish taco - AWESOME

Spicy chicken taco - very good

Chips & guac - very good...served with a fried pig skin (?): an airy, crunchy affair covered in spice.

Squid - ORDER THIS OR ELSE you will not experience one of the best fried calamari dishes I've ever had...the breading is light and doused in a spicy sauce that's orgasmically tasty, and it comes covered in guacamole and jalapenos. Incredible!

Desserts are served in little mason jars...I recommend the \"Electric dirt\" (chocolate, ganache). \"Key-lime pie\" was just okay.

Bourbon cocktails were good but not mind-blowing...between the bourbon sour and the bourbonade I'd definitely choose the sour. It comes with cracked pepper on top; interesting touch.

Also I loved the blaring hip hop. Someone's got sweet taste in both music AND Mexican food :)"}
{"text":"A little pricey, but great tacos. If I had to rate them out of 10, they'd be a 9.

The wait is kind of insane for a taco place, so be sure to get there and line up before it  opens -- a whole half hour early on a weeknight.

The baja fish taco is the real winner, with al pastor coming in second. The chips that come with the guac are pretty unique too, but good."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, excellent food, fantastic service. Small and cozy so get there early."}
{"text":"BBQ food and drinks are awesome!  Crack Rolls and Rib Ends are great!  This is a lot must for all the carnivores out there!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Chicago.   Fantastic tacos!  Cool vibe, ambiance, and neighborhood."}
{"text":"Two stars seems low, but the truth is...\"Meh. I've experienced better\" is accurate. 

In my opinion, this place is so overrated. It's a shame because the food is really good and fast and fresh. But the atmosphere sucks and I've never experienced more blasé service anywhere else in the city. 

After waiting 20 minutes for a table for two (that's fine) we're escorted to the bar. I don't mind this, but I like to be given the option of this or waiting for a real table. 

The music is so incredibly loud that it is hard to hold a conversation (This makes me feel really old!). Blaring angry hip hop does not make for a great dinner atmosphere. Nor does it make you cool. 

The servers  demonstrate zero personality or warmth.  

The menu is hard to read in the dark and offers no descriptions of the menu items. 

So, there are better places to get tacos, such as Playa Cabana or La Carnita, where you get way more of a dining experience for your hard earned $$$ instead of feeling rushed and deaf. 

Maybe it's better during patio season?"}
{"text":"Heard lots of good things about the place, but when I tried it I wasn't impressed.   The food was planning that WOW factor as it didn't pack the necessary punch."}
{"text":"Nice small restaurant.  I wouldn't lower the stars because of the wait...it is what it is.  When we showed up, it was an hour and 45 minute wait, but they take your number and text you when to head back.  So we went down the street had some beers.  About an hour later we got a text to head back, and by time we got there our table was ready.

As mentioned this place is small and quant.  FYI no bill splitting.  Drinks were good, but the real Gem are the tacos.  We had the fish , pork belly, Chicken, Beef, Chirozo tacos  I loved the Beef and Fish.  Pork was ok, but that is a personal choice as I hate pineapples.

Service was on point, food and drinks came out fast.   Guac was great.

Price point was fair and on par with other places.

The only complaint i would have is that the music is way too loud.  They need to turn it down a bit .  But the food was delicious.  But as many people have mentioned be prepared to wait for a table. (arrive early with the expectations to walk down queen for a drink before being seated)"}
{"text":"Had late lunch here with the wife and we ordered the ff:

Guacamole and chips -$8

Tacos ($3.60 each)
Fish tacos 
3 pork belly tacos
1 beef Cheek
1 scrapple

The tacos are very tasty but very small. The corn tortillas aren't double stacked. 

$38 with taxes and tips. Will be back if I'm in the area"}
{"text":"The lineup is legendary, but is it worth the wait? Yes and no. Yes, if the wait is an hour or less and, no, if more. This area of Parkdale is still not the best of places to stand around and wait. And if you're hungry when you arrive, you're probably famished two hours later.

We had a plan of attack and arrived at 6pm sharp on a Sunday, to only just miss out on the first seating. So, we were given an hour wait quote and bravely walked around the hood. Being Sunday, even the Dollarama was closed and we settled on a small gelato shop that had just opened on the heels of the gentrification. Yes, we ate before we ate, and dessert at that.

When we were finally seated at Grand Electric the guacamole and chips and tacos that followed were full of flavour and well worth the wait. So, believe the hype but don't be ridiculous and wait three hours for $5 tacos."}
{"text":"Definitely get the fish taco. It's amazing. The rest of the food is almost as great too. The only reason I'm docking a star is for the loud hip hop they were blaring all through the meal. I didn't come to dance, I came to eat and talk with my friends. Otherwise, excellent place."}
{"text":"Every time Brad and I plan a trip to Toronto, we ask for recommendations of where to eat. Every time, someone tells us Grand Electric. I'm so glad we went!

The menu was quite simple. Brad ordered a chicken taco and 2 pork tacos (I think cheek and belly, but don't quote me on that) and he ordered a drink, but again I don't remember what he got. I ordered the Baja fish taco, crispy cauliflower, and a margarita. We both split the Ticka Tostada.

The tacos were great! Though I only had 2, I thought the Baja fish was one of the best I've ever had! The cauliflower was good, and I would still get it again. Brad loved his tacos, but found it odd they don't ask \"hot, medium or mild\" when ordering. I think it's because they gave you so many hot sauces on the side. The Tostada was great as well! Though, I thought a bit spicy.

The greatest part was the margarita. I could easily have about 5 of them, it was so delicious and fresh without that artificial taste.

I definitely want to come back!"}
{"text":"I have been a patron of Grand Electric since they first opened. I went two nights ago for the first time in years and it is still as amazing as ever. Beef Cheek tacos are excellent and $4 each. I had 3 of those and 1 spicy chicken, washed down with a Sol. I look forward to checking out the back patio at some point. Their food makes up for the wait table time. I have in the past eaten chicken wings at Cadillac lounge while waiting for my table at GE, then eating again there. No shame. I also adore the booze list on the wall. GE is good times for people watching too. Their tuna ceviche is also incredible.  I could say a lot more but I think 5 stars says enough. One time I got tacos to go to eat the next day I love them so much."}
{"text":"I am writing a second review, not because the food has changed - it is still the same: pretty good, kinda authentic Mexican tacos (but not really) and tasting the same each time , which is a plus (consistency). 

The reason I lowered yet another star from the already average rating is twofold :

1. The staff is overly casual and familiar. That might work for the wannabe hipster crowd that seems to gush over this place, but it is definitely not cool for the 40+ business crowd in dress shirts and suits. I brought a business partner for lunch here and I could see how awkward he felt when the barman and the waitress were taking too familiar liberties in both speech and gesture. After all, his type of crowd dines in places where waiters wear tuxedos. 

2. When the patio is closed (8 months of the year ) the place is tiny ! Very few tables and always occupied by hipsters so it is difficult to find space. The one good table is always reserved. The waitress offers the bar but no group would sit on the bar - that's only for when one is alone."}
{"text":"What's with the rush?? Honestly a great restaurant isn't just about the food- it's about the experience. Very tasty tacos and great margaritas but the staff was in a rush to get us out!

I feel awful giving this place two stars but I am huge fan of the sister restaurant - Electric Mud, where the line ups are also long but at least when you are in, you are not badgered constantly to see \"if you are okay\" even when you have told them every two minutes that you are waiting for the food. Best part was when they slipped us the bill when we had ordered dessert without asking us and when we tried to order a round of drinks, we were told there is a policy of \"no after dessert drinks\".

I get that you are a business and you are in demand and you probably don't care if we come back but this honestly seems to be the feedback from a bunch of people I spoke to who have been there. 

If you are in the mood for some seriously delicious tacos, then by all means brave the line and go but just know that you have to eat and get out. Don't even think about socializing. I feel guilty giving this place two stars. I do."}
{"text":"A long time ago it was my favourite because they were so delicious. Today I went back and the place look nicer now. Unfortunately I ordered a beef cheek and cauliflower taco. Beef cheek taco tastes different than before. It is not my favourite anymore. It used to be.  Cauliflower taco is still good.  

Please bring beef cheek taco back. I don't know what they did with the ingredients now.  Anyways I will still come back for the cauliflowers and other foods options."}
{"text":"I really like Grand Electric, it's one of the standouts of the Parkdale scene, although the secret is out of the bag...it's Popular!

A WARNING: Do not come here while starving.  The waits will be long, yes even on Mondays at 5:30 PM when you think no one else will be here.  The correct strategy is to arrive at least an hour before you're going to want to eat, and if it's a Friday or Saturday, the wait quickly extends to 2+ hours.  Thankfully, the Rhino across the street offers excellent beers at cheap prices.

The FOOD: I love their fish tacos.  While there is a slight variation from visit to visit, when they're perfect, they're perfect...just the right combination of acid, heat, and flavor on the fish.  The other tacos have all been great, although I'm too scared to try the scrapple.  The portions are small...plan to order 3-4 plus something else.  I've also tried the squid and the ceviche, and both were solid.  I have to give the food 5 stars.

The DRINKS:  They have a great variety of bourbons, although many of them are properly expensive.  There are very cheap Jack Daniel's shots if you just want to get wasted.  I'm usually underwhelmed by their draft list, either the offerings or their compatibility with the food (a stout just doesn't go with tacos).  The cocktails are above average, but not excellent.  4 stars.

The SERVICE:  Fairly good, not excellent.  At time it can be a bit uneven with the pacing and drink orders.  This place is busy.  I've found the staff done't always know their beers, although they're pretty solid on food knowledge.  4 stars.

The Vibe:  It's got the feel of a bit of a dive bar.  It's very dark inside and very loud.  Be prepared to shout at your table mates.  4 stars.

Overall, I always love going to Grand Electric, I just really hate the wait.  Thankfully they're good at calling you when your table is ready, so you can enjoy some beverages elsewhere.   Just don't bother at 7 PM on Friday."}
{"text":"Excellent mini tacos! I love the pork and chicken tacos. The nachos and guacamole is delish. The atmosphere is cool and also a little hipsterly. It gets crowded most nights, especially on the weekends so you have to leave your name for a table and they'll call. Service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Grand Electric was a pioneer of sorts in the taco scene in Toronto. After several years now, it is still going strong.

I stopped in recently for a late afternoon pre-dinner dinner of tacos and drinks.

The tacos are very good. I tried a few. The pork belly, while flavourful and tasty, was bested a bit by the seemingly ubiquitous shrimp taco, which was not the least bit rubbery or over cooked.

A visit here in the late afternoon in summer is a great idea. Crowds are lighter, and you can snag a seat (with some luck) on the quaint patio without a reservation. 

Cocktails lack flair, yet are good. Plenty of can and bottle beers available as well.

Service at the patio is surprisingly attentive and on point. The hip, casual staff are on top of their game.

I have had greater \"wow\" experiences elsewhere, yet a nice drink, delicious taco and good service on a sunny afternoon here is a delight."}
{"text":"I love tacos  probably top on my list for go to foods. This place is good, but kind of disappointed on their fish tacos. Although they weren't horrible, they just weren't local fish tacos. I'd say if you are going to come here for tacos do the shrimp over the fish. The patio is cute, nice lunch spot. I may come back. May."}
{"text":"Thursday night, 6:30pm, seated right away!

What we ate:
- Tuna ceviche (4/5): while very fresh and yummy, a little too lemon-y for my taste buds.
- Baja fish taco (4/5): Delicious, not greasy, light flavors
- Pig tail (5/5): Unexpected awesomeness, a unique texture and worth trying
- Porc belly (5/5): This one was my favorite, BAM!
- Bourbonade: Bourbone, mint, lemonade..exquisite and well priced!

I am a fan!  Not sure if I would wait more than 30 mins in line for this though!"}
{"text":"They make really bomb diggity tacos! I tried their shrimp, fish, beef cheek, roast pork, pork belly, and their mission wings on the special side of the menu and boy was it amazing!

The price for a taco is fair, not cheap but fair. you would get the same price in any hipster taco place like this. The ambience is chill and relaxed. They have a back door patio. It was super hot that day so buy some beers or try any of their cold drinks.

The tacos were all A. Nothing was over cooked, everything was topped with fresh ingredients, and they were all flavoured amazingly! The wings were big! and sooooooo freakin tasty! But I couldn't justify paying 9 dollars for three pieces of wings, so that's why they lost a star.

I recommend this place. They accept cash, credit, debit, but no splitting bills. You can tell them waht you've ordered and pay your own seperately. I have to say the service was pretty fast on a saturday night!"}
{"text":"I love this place!  My favorite taco in the city is at Grand Electric...the infamous baja fish taco.  Perfectly fried and crispy battered fish that is anything but dry, topped with cabbage, radishes, cilantro, salsa and lime mayo.  Yum.  A few years ago they used to serve pickled chili onions to go with the tacos.  Although they have stopped bringing them to the table with your tacos, if you ask, you shall still receive.  I highly recommend doing this...those little onions take the tacos to the next level!
My second favourite menu item is the tuna ceviche.  It is absolutely delicious.  A perfect balance of spicy and creamy, delicate and crunchy.  Lime marinated albacore tuna is mixed with a fish sauce vinaigrette, avocado mayo, a medley of hot peppers (jalapeños?), celery and herbs, topped with crispy shallots and served atop a tostada.  I \"mmmm\" every time I eat it.  I can easily eat one on my own and have room (/force myself to find room) for a fish taco.  But if it's your first time and you want to try a few different things, this is a great shareable plate.
The restaurant itself is pretty small and you may feel a little bit cramped in, but this is pretty typical of Queen St. and Parkdale venues, especially popular ones.  There is usually a wait to get seated, but it's well worth it.  My only complaint is that the music inside tends to be quite loud so conversations can be slightly strained.  I personally think this is a tactic to encourage a quicker turnover so that they can accommodate the volume of people coming through the place.  Luckily in the summer the back patio is open, which is much quieter and slightly more spacious.  It's not glamorous with the plastic tables and chairs, but the atmosphere is nice nonetheless.
I've been coming here for years, at least once a month if not more frequently, and I highly recommend it.  Once you try the food you will understand; the food speaks for itself!"}
{"text":"Congratulations! You just made it to my top worst restaurants in Toronto. Went there on a Sunday afternoon, ordered CHIP & DIP, TUNA CEVICHE, & SPICY SQUID. Only thing I can positively comment on were the chips. The dips were watered down, and bland. Spicy Squid! OMG, the worst I've ever had. I just wish they youtube how to cook squid, would of been a better idea. Overcooked, not chewy, not really sure the kind of taste they wanted me to conclude. Just weird! TUNA CEVICHE! Icing on the cake for banning this place. Once again, not sure if they know what is ceviche, but the taste was just awful. Tuna, avocado, coleslaw??? WTF? Slaw in a ceviche? Was literally chunks of tuna and thick slice of cabbage tossed together. And by the way, fish wasn't fresh. Just wanted to shoot this review before shooting it in the can. Dish was not appetizing, nor pleasant to look at. (Actually, neither of the dishes were arranged in an appetizing manner).
And to attest with a review about their service, indeed the staff ain't that attentive. Once again, not the most pleasant dinning experience I've ever had. 
PLEASE DO NOT FALL INTO THE HIPSTER TRAP AND HAND AROUND AND WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY. TACO BELL might be a better alternative. Maybe not for the overall food, but at least you know what to expect, and for sure they'll be someone that will give their full attention to you while taking your order and making your payment."}
{"text":"Love it here and I crave it everytimenin in Parkdale. I always get the nachos and the beef cheek taco. Love the vibe if you like oldschool hip hop"}
{"text":"Best fish taco ever! Loved the pork as well.  Will definitely be back, even though the atmosphere sucks because they play the loudest music ever.  They clearly want you in and out as fast as possible. Service was odd too, though I can't quite put my finger on it. Kinda of pretentious I think, and a bit cold.  You definitely go here for an eating experience, not a dining one. One of those places where you accept the bad because the food is so darn good! Best to show up as soon as they open. i don't line up for food - booze maybe... but not food! :)"}
{"text":"I probably come here every 2-3 weeks. The food is delicious!! I love the spicy chicken, baja, and yam tacos. Great price and I always take advantage of their $4 whiskey specials. 

The only issue is the no modifications rule. I didn't have a problem but my bf did as he likes his food very plain!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry but I feel like the people that left positive reviews here are just Grand Electric employee's in disguise. 

I found out about this place on UberEats, they categorized this restaurant as a \"Best of Toronto Exclusive\" so I was curious. It was very small inside, I'd guess they can fit a maximum of 20 people. It seems like a walk in -have a quick snack- get out kind of place.

We ordered a Pork Belly Quesadilla to split but got instantly depressed when it showed up at the table and was the size of a normal taco.. definitely too small to split between two people (think the waitress could have explained that?) However, it was the best tasting two bites of the evening. 

We also tried the Baja Fish and Cauliflower tacos which were alright. Nothing special. 
The bill was 30 freakin' dollars. No drinks, no desserts, just a few bite sized, average tacos. 

Left hungry. Not worth the money whatsoever. 

I'd avoid."}
{"text":"4 stars for tacos 
2 for their grand electric sour

1 star for the hostess telling me it will be a 90-120 minute wait, but she calls us in 30 mins after to say there was something available. Wait, so maybe that's supposed to be 3 star service then???

Sorry, i've had much better bourbon sour in this city and especially outside this city but they get 2 stars since it was still a smooth drink at a decent price.  

4 star for the vibe and service. Great casual vibe. Mix of people on a late Friday night. Service was great.

Had the fish, chicken, and pork belly taco last night. We loved the fish. The chicken did have enough heat in it, very tender. Not a fan of the pork belly since I'm used to the melt in your mouth pork belly style in Nyc ... maybe they ran out of what pork belly should be ? It was cut up small pieces of pork chop that was a bit over cooked. It was dry, and if it weren't for the salsa, it would have been a disastrous taco. Okay 1 star for this particular pork belly taco.

It doesn't add up, but over all I give it a 4 star review!"}
{"text":"People rave about this place - and I *think* I see why, though it isn't necessarily because of the food. Grand Electric has an atmosphere + ambiance that makes you *feel* like you're having a good time - it has an intimate community atmosphere where it's lively, casual, and you feel nothing awkward. It fuels the idea that you're having just a plain ol' good time with friends over good drinks and food. And that warrants this place's popularity and stars.

We dropped by a weekday evening around 6:30 PM, and this place was jammed - there aren't many seats to begin with. So note - if you don't want to share a communal table or be stuck waiting at the door. There's also a good amount of paid street parking in front of the restaurant.

In terms of the food itself (which we came for), I actually think there are tastier taco joints in Toronto. We ordered the nachos platter which came with different dips (a good-sized portion, and good for a group), and a variety of tacos. They weren't bad - not excellent, but they were alright (if I remember correctly, the Baja Fish taco was the standout for us).

Overall, I think if you come here, you're visiting for more than just the food - you're here for the atmosphere, the hip & casual spot to grab drinks with friends, and for the community. But if you're coming here solely to look for life-changing Mexican food, I'd look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Shrimp tacos and the Boiler makers are my favourite!!
Great vibe, amazing music and the food won't disappoint!!!
Great staff too, super friendly and easy going!"}
{"text":"Great fish and pork tacos! I also tried their calamari which pretty good. Staff is very friendly and courteous. I'll definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Their salmon crudo is pretty memorable. Tad pricier but chill vibes. Cool spot especially when it's warmer nonetheless."}
{"text":"This is a hipster, taco place with loud, hip hop music and divine food!

Definitely make a reservation and go for drinks nearby... they'll text you when your table is ready. This place best suits 2-4 people. There's a picnic style table in the front that seats 6, but I think that's as big as they go.

Excellent cocktail list, huge collection of bourbon, and they make a great Caesar with decent garnish. 

Love the table condiments here. I'm a huge hot sauce person, so I was happy to see housemade salsa verde, Mexican hot sauce and scotch bonnet hot sauce. 

What have I tried here? Baja Fish Tacos (the best), Pork Belly Tacos (love that they come with pineapple), Shrimp Tacos, Tuna Ceviche, and Spicy Squid. The Tuna Ceviche was definitely my favourite... it's a mini tower of tasty goodness all wrapped up in sparkling citrus and yuzu mayo. 

Be sure to check out the daily specials too... lots of goodness to be found there."}
{"text":"Love the food but hate the loud obnoxious gangster rap. Please please please change the hideous music!!! And the servers moods are a hit or miss depending on who's working.. And fyi the owner(s) got greedy and raised the prices. Example, the tuna ceviché costs more since the last time I went. I hope the tuna is sustainably caught. Or else the owner is just a plain greedy pig!"}
{"text":"This place was ok but they were super strange when I didn't want sour cream on my burrito and told me they can't make it without and also asked what part of sour cream I was allergic to, (apparently being allergic is the only way to not have sour cream on your burrito here). Then, because I was allergic to sour cream, they took it upon themselves to remove sour cream from everyone else's burrito's at my table."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for about a year now but finally got to try this place today with a friend.

My initial reaction of the neighbourhood was a little shocking. Maybe it's because I rarely venture out of the suburbs but I parked 13 minutes away from the place and was approached by at least 4 people asking for change.

I saw at least three people sleeping on the street also. I can see what fellow reviewers were speaking about with how the area is very hipster chic. I have to say I saw a lot of people walking around with some seriously stylish outfits. 

As I entered the restaurant I didn't find it to be that interesting. Just looks like your average place. I didn't find the music too loud but I have to say they know how to fit a lot of people in there with their carefully coordinated tables.

People were coming in and out and being seated quickly mind you this was at 2pm on a Sunday.

I decided to start with an ordering of 3 Baja fish tacos. I didn't find them to be that small or as pretty as they are in the Yelp photos.

I am speechless at how this is their most popular taco. It was seriously under seasoned and I didn't like how light and fluffy the fish was. I would have liked to have a thicker crust on the fish. The whole taco was so bland all I tasted was the sour cream. 

Unfortunately I can't comment on any of their other dishes because I was so unimpressed I decided to call it a wrap.

Fellow Yelp reviewers commented that the servers are rude. While most are nice I did have one girl serve me my friends tacos and when I told her that's not mine she replied \" Well that's the way they come out\". 

That had to be one of the most stupidest responses I've ever heard in my life. I decided to just nod and smile because you just can't fix stupid.

Other than that girl I found all the servers to be very friendly and helpful. Clearly this is a very popular place. If you like very highly seasoned food I would suggest you don't come here. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Delicious drinks. Great atmosphere. 
BUT, music was far to loud; had to yell our order and struggled to have a conversation. The staff were rude; everyone seemed angry to be there. They were unhelpful, making us feel like we were bothering them by being there. 
They are lucky their tacos rock, because the service was that bad."}
{"text":"Get there super early if you want to eat right when Grand Electric opens. 

I joined my friend who had been lining up since 5:30 p.m. and there was at least 10 people ahead of us.  We managed to grab the last, large table for our party of six. 

Despite of the line ups, Grand Electric is a lovely place for dinner. We ordered a variety of tacos but the ones that were my favourites were Baja fish and beef cheeks. We also tried the ceviche too - so good and fresh!

Known for their cocktails, the G.E. Bourbon Sour is a must.  Their selection of bourbons is impressive. 

Definitely come here for good food and the vibe but try to visit after the rush. It won't be as crowded."}
{"text":"*4.5 stars*

This review is based on most recent visit.  'Twas a beautiful sunny Saturday afternoon when I decided it was about time we gorge on some delicious tacos.

We arrived just after 7pm, and was quoted for a 2-hr wait for the 7 of us.  As expected, we grabbed a few drinks at Cadillac Lounge just a few doors down.  Since they changed their policy to not take phone numbers anymore, we had to go back in about 1.5 hours to check... we were told to stick around.  The hostess informed us that there were 3 more med-large groups ahead of us, waiting to be seated in this 30-seat (give or take) resto, and that's when we quoted ourselves another 1-2 hour wait and groaned...  

So we finally got sat 4 hours later, and nestled into the picnic table right by the open window at the front.  It never felt so good to finally get seated!  As much as I loved the dark and simple decor, I also loved the old school hip hop and blend of music!   Anyway,  with our stomachs growling, we did not hesitate to order right away:

Fish Taco: $3 (5/5 stars)
Batter was perfect!  By far, my fave of the night.  This is probably the only time  i did not take notice of what fish was being used (I think it tasted like baja... and maybe mixed w a bit of crack), but I didn't care.  This one right here converted a non-fish eater to order and love this taco!  

Beef Cheek Taco: $3 (4/5 stars)
A  tad dry for me, but still delicious.  It kind of reminded me a bit of beef jerky for some reason.  Super flavourful!

Pork Taco: $3 (4.5/5 stars)
By this point, I just assume that everything I put into my mouth will deserve a 4 star or more.  On the GE delish scale, this fell between the beef and the fish.

Pig tail: $3 (5/5 stars)
Sooo good! Why didn't I get this the first round?!?!?! Oh right, cause I already ordered 5 others and thought it would be enough...

Tuna Ceviche: $8 (2.5/5 stars)
I've had waaaaayy better ceviche.  The fish and other components were good, but i thought it was a little too acidic even for a ceviche.  There was almost no balance... but wait, is that a tostada underneath?? Oh me oh my it is!!  So this is when I decided to give it the extra 0.5 stars (well, good portion too I guess).

Miami Ribs: $13 (4.5/5 stars)
       [ **Miami Ribs 101: (n.pl.) Refer to any ribs that are NOT pork, and has nothing to do with the city itself.  It is usually beef or veal that are thinly cut and marinaded in anyway, then braised or slowly roasted to let it reach it's tenderness, but could also be grilled.  It got its name from the large Jewish population in southern Florida.**]
So here, they were korean-cut  beef ribs marinaded in something too delicious, that you should stop reading and just go EAT!  However, only 3 pieces.

Bourbon Lemonade: $?? (3/5 stars)
Not a typical cocktailer, but when I do, I like them nice and strong!  It came in a large glass and it tasted simply like lemonade w bourbon.  If you don't usually like bourbon or strong cocktails, do not get this.  However, if you like sour and strong drinks like me, then you'll appreciate it.  

Service: (4/5 stars)
Server waited us like any awesome server would.  Kitchen service was amazing, delivering great food in such a short time!!  I guess they would have to, since most people would be starving after waiting so long.  The big \"but\" is that they really need to estimate their wait times with much much much much much more accuracy.  Two hours off is not acceptable!

I do need to mention that their guac is pretty good although we didn't get it this time (not sure why).  Also, they have a ginormous list of bourbons, as well as wines, and some beer.  So prepare to drink up!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place out since it's usually teeming, and it was...okay. Though slightly more expensive, Barrio Coreano blows it out of the water. The chips & guac made up for the lack luster tacos though."}
{"text":"Hands down best taco in TO!!! Love the shrimp taco. It's a small place so prepare to wait for a table. The staff are nice, friendly, & knowledgeable"}
{"text":"Hip hop and mexican food .. I'm in heaven. 

Came here on a saturday night thinking it would be pretty hard to get in.. Was told it would be an hour and 15 minutes wait, so we gave our number and headed out to another bar in the area to kill time. Just as we got our drinks at the other bar we got a text saying our table was ready so we chugged our beers and headed over. We started with drinks and some nachos with guac and salsa. The salsa was especially good! I had the chicken and baja fish taco. The fish was definitely my favourite.. melt in your mouth good. The chicken was surprisingly spicy too! Only downside was the very small wine selection. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Ordered through Uber Eats. Food was delayed over an hour after scheduled delivery date (mostly Grand Electric's fault but also very much Uber Eats' fault) so waited almost 2 hours for food to arrive and I live 10 mins away. Food arrived cold, portions for the guac and beans were super small and the large salad was more like an xs salad. The tacos were soggy and coldish. Not a great experience for $130."}
{"text":"Really, really into the food here, love the wait protocol (you give your name + number, wait at a nearby bar, they text you, you eat, yum yum.) And the daily bourbon specials? A lifesaver in an otherwise pretty puritanical city for alcoholics. 

There were two problems, though: 

1. If you are going to rock the \"we're a taco joint,\" you have to realize that TACO JOINTS DOUBLE LAYER THEIR SOFT TACOS. One tortilla is not enough. Go to a legit taco joint in the States, the kind of place that this restaurant is trying (I think?) to emulate - there's always two tortillas. 

2. The blasting hip hop music is cool and all...but the overuse of \"ghetto,\" etc to describe different menu items is sort of offensive. Maybe they don't get it because it's all Canadian and such, but myself being an American, it was a little over the top...\"ghetto\" lemonade? Really? Why not just crack out the watermelon and grape drink while you are at it? Oh wait, that's probably at their sister restaurant, Electric Mud BBQ."}
{"text":"It's a great place to go for a first/second date(s), however I really wish they would turn the music lower so ppl don't have to scream to talk to their friends. :s

I went here on a 2nd date with a guy and we ordered a total of 14 tacos. He really enjoyed the \"very spicy chicken\" ($3.60 ea), while I enjoyed the \"beef cheek\" (sweeter, and texture like pulled pork but with beef). We were both pleasantly surprised at how \"fun\" the \"crispy cauliflower\" was (veg) taste. A little harder to fold and eat, but I thought it was great.

Overall, the food is good (not amazing but good), the atmosphere is very fun (good for groups of 4 or just 2 ppl), the space isn't as tiny as other restaurants like OddSeoul on Ossington Strip, and they've got a plethora of drink choices ($4 shots)."}
{"text":"I remember when this place first opened, my friends waited over 4 hours to get a table. Although I wanted to try this place since I love tacos, this was a serious deterrent to trying it anytime close to opening. I had heard it was pretty easy to get a table for lunch, so my girlfriend and I decided decided to finally give it a try.

When we walked in, as expected, they were blasting old school hip hop music. Luckily we got a table away from the speaker, or it would have been a bit much for lunch time. I could see this being fun however if knocking back a few bourbon shots with your tacos on a Friday or Saturday night. Luckily, as someone who likes old school hip hop, they had great selections and the soundtrack to our meal was very well done. 

The service was impeccable. The gentleman who served us (unsure of his name, but he mentioned he was a vegetarian) did a great job. He did it with a smile, didn't seem hurried or bored (which must be a real challenge considering they have to describe these same dishes day in and day out), and happily answered any questions we had with more than the expected amount of detail. This guy deserves credit for the above and beyond service. 

Now for my review of the food. I'll preface this by saying that with the amount of hype surrounding this place since it opened, I will admit that there was almost an unfair level of expectation going into this place. It was difficult to detach that level of expectation before walking in and give it an unbiased review. 

We started off with the guac and chips. The chips would have been very tasty, but they were way over salted. They were warm, fresh, and had just the right amount of oil, but the amount of salt they put on it was overpowering, unnecessary, and kind of ruined the dish. The guacamole was average. Not bad, but not great. However, even average guacamole is tasty. That being said, we felt that $8 was a bit much or this dish.

The pork belly taco with fermented pineapple sounded amazing when it was described, but I found it to be too acidic (and yes I like pineapple), and again, too salty. 

The beef cheek was decent. The sauce on it was great, and it packed quite a punch with the heat which was impressive. I find a lot of taco joints in Toronto hold back in the heat department, but this is not the case with Grand Electric. However, the dish was again brought down because it was just too salty. 

The crispy cauliflower taco was great. Nice and crispy and whatever spice they had in there (either cilantro or cumin; I can't remember) was strong, but it really lifted the dish up to a well above average level.

The baja fish taco was the showstopper. It is the baja fish taco I've ever eaten. In fact, it's one of the best pieces of battered fish I've ever eaten. Perfect amount of batter to fish ratio, and the beer batter was to die for. The cream sauce, cabbage and lime coupled with the fish was the perfect flavour combination. It's too bad the rest of their tacos weren't like this.

Although the cauliflower baja fish tacos were very good to amazing, this place drops down in the rankings because the other 3 dishes we had weren't really that impressive. Simply put, 2/5 dishes hitting the mark isn't enough to make Grand Electric live up to the hype. I would definitely come back, but would stick to the better parts of their menu."}
{"text":"While in town for a conference, I met some new Canadian friends who work in the food industry and they took me to Grand Electric.  They stated that this was the best taco place in the city, and Canadians don't lie. Ever.

And this place was pretty darn good.  The ambiance was like almost every other eclectic taco place I have been to in the states.  Lots of tacos, more beers, and even more bourbons.  And I am talking good bourbons too... I am from Kentucky after all.  In fact they do a shot of the day and a 4 dollar Four Roses shot on a Tuesday is a bargain.

The food was pretty awesome as well.  What I have learned is that anything with horse radishes is the real deal, and there were a lot of horse radishes!  The taco that suck out to me was the fish taco.  A nice piece of fried fish mixed in with the fixings.  Yum, yum.

I cant tell you about the prices because I didn't see the bill or really the menu, but it is cash only.  Also there is usually a long wait almost everyday of the week and of all hours.  We were lucky and only had to wait about 10 minutes.  This was on a Sunday around 8, so maybe that is the money time.  Who knows, but if you get a chance everything about this place is money and worth it."}
{"text":"Cool little taco bar. The food is good, but no longer the best tacos in Toronto. If you feel rushed, don't be surprised. Try the fish taco, and the chips and guac."}
{"text":"I knew this place was going to be busy but wow, it was absolutely packed when we tried to get in on a Tuesday evening. Jam packed. We put our names down and then strolled over to the Drake, a few streets over, to grab a drink. 

Very cool how the hostess takes your name down and then texts you when your table is ready. You have 10-15 minutes to get back.

Place is super hipster but the food is delicious. We ordered a ton of food and a couple of drinks:

- Jesus juice ($8)
- My cousin had something I don't remember

Specials/other stuff
- Spicy squid ($9) - amazing, order this! NO questions asked.
- Tuna ceviche ($13.50) - so good as well, oh my god. I'm a sucker for a good ceviche. Fresh, full of flavour.

Tacos ($3.60 each)
- Scrapple - interesting. Ordered it out of novelty. Basically, pork scraps cooked together and served in a nice, small rectangular shape. Trying it once was good enough, wouldn't order it again.
- 2x baja fish - love me some fish tacos
- Crispy cauliflower - surprisingly better than I thought it would be.
- Spicy chicken
- 2x Pork belly al pastor

All the food was delicious and we were stuffed by the end of the night. Really like the vibe and place is bumpin' with good (loud) music and the hipster vibe. Definitely happy that I came here and was able to try it out."}
{"text":"The good: I have always been meaning to try this place after falling in love with tacos at seven lives. This place lived up to its reputation, I loved their tacos! I pretty much tried all their whole menu but my favourite were Tuna ceviche (appetizer), Baja fish taco, Pork belly taco, Spicy chicken, and Tuna belly and grapefruit (special). The selection of beverages is very good here.

The bad: portions can be a bit small, you would have to order quite a bit to be filled.

The ugly: not to anyone's surprise but the seating here is limited, come early for seats! 

Neutral: great atmosphere, service, and lighting. Good for dates or groups of 4."}
{"text":"Among the best tacos I've ever had. Worth the wait for seating. Reasonably priced and can't be beat. Music and atmosphere is loud but incredibly fun."}
{"text":"I've never had a real taco outside of Canada/USA, so this is just my opinion based on what is available here. I went with my wife and we ordered at least one of every item on the menu - yeah we are pigs.  I can't decide which one is my favorite but the beef cheek is up there. It is loud and dark, we also had to wait 45 minutes for seats. I hate noise and waiting, but I'll definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Was I really in Canada??? I thought Canadians are known to be friendly. 

Atmosphere: Really tiny, modern (think beige curtains covering the entrance, polished wooden bar table, blackboard painted chalk menu), dark bar space that squeezes everyone in with tiny tables for food. I stress the dark and the tiny. LOUD hiphop and rap playing. Modelesque mixed ethnic looking plaid shirted bartenders and bitchy bohemian chic waitresses.

Food/Drinks: I came here around 5pm, thinking I would get predinner cocktails. I was planning to have dinner here if their food looked amazing. Their \"dinner entrees\" did not look appetizing. While this place fronts like a restaurant, it is really a bar with appetizers, because it literally has maybe 4 dishes on the menu, all of which are tiny mini tacos and 1 of the 4 dishes are nachos. And not supreme fixed nachos, literally like the free chips you get at a mexican restaurant but have to pay for. And they are expensive for how tiny they are, because I'd need like $40 worth of tacos to feel full.

What I hated about this place was how the waitresses were pushing me to order their limited selection of dinner while Im sitting at the bar. I get that dinner would help increase their tip but seriously asking me EVERY 5 min if I wanted dinner when I clearly stated I wanted to just drink gets flat out annoying and I will not want to tip you at all. It was busy in there but there was no one standing in line to get seated. 

Because I dont want to say everything was horrible, I'll try to end positively: lots of tequila options. All around $10-15. I tried 2 cocktails which were the fancy mixology kind where they add eggwhite toppings and black pepper sprinkled over your dashes of lavender and alcohol. Pretty good, but not worth the experience here."}
{"text":"It literally poured rain all over me and my friends tonight and we STILL stuck around to drink some bourbonade and eat our baja fish tacos.  The flavours in these tacos are SO yummy.  The chicken tacos are also really great tasting (and smelling!).  Our table also finished off a beef cheek taco, a pork belly taco, some guac/chips and a tuna ceviche.  All super fresh, all totally delicious.  I was SO sad it poured so hard or I would have stuck around and eaten that menu 2 more times over.

Staff were so friendly.  One of the guys even went to Dollarama and bought umbrellas for all the tables.  Very knowledgeable, NOT pretentious just a joint full of good people it seems.

Will be back again and again...!"}
{"text":"This place was good and draws a vey mixed crowd of people. Definitely got character. Went on a Saturday right when it opened (they do not take reservations). 

The food was very prettily presented and it is more of a tapas style restaurant than actual meal style. 

Ordered: 

-fish and cauliflower tacos which were good, but not life changing 

-the tortilla soup was very good and had a very diverse and rich flavour profile

-chicken wings were good and meaty 

- ceviche was disappointing, repeated properly, but not the right proportions for all the ingredients in it

- the spicy squid was good and the fresh guac added a nice balancing note to the food 

- the kale salad is GREAT! It is not overdressed and comes with twisted spiced nuts of sorts on top. Delicious! 

-mojito was very sweet, but still yummy and had a great ginger presence

-the lemon/lime? Dessert was good but nothing out of this world and very small portion (a two bite dessert kind of feel)"}
{"text":"Great place for a trendy Mexican taco joint.  Casual setting--when we went there were only two servers at a time even when the restaurant was at capacity at around 12:30-1pm.  It's a fairly small space so I'm not surprised that there are lineups during peak hours.  Two of us ordered $60 worth of food including tips and taxes.  It was a bit pricey, but we wanted to try as many items as we could since we are not in the area very often.  We ordered the tuna ceviche (probably our fave), fried spicy squid (got a bit of a kick to it but not too overpowering), baja fish tacos, pork carnitas taco, shrimp taco, and spicy chicken.  Our least favourite was probably the spicy chicken.  The baja fish itself seemed to be lacking flavour and was a bit bland. We also noticed that the sour cream sauces on the tacos were quite watered down. The pork carnitas and shrimp tacos were probably our favourite."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service. Came here on a Sunday night and there was a 45 minute wait inside, so we sat on the patio. Ordered the pozole, Baja fish, pork belly, and spicy chicken. The food came pretty fast and it was delicious. Very rich in flavor and just enough spice. Would definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Was in cilantro and lime heaven! Pork Tinga Tacos were my favorite followed closely by the Fish Tacos, Ceviche and Guac & Chips. I arrived at 6:10 last Friday and there was already a 90 min wait plus many others on the wait-list, crazy!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was overhyped for me but I found Grand Electric pretty average. Service was good, restaurant is cool but the food was only average.

Food: Tacos which I'd say are the main highlight of the restaurant missed the mark for me. We ordered the Baja Fish Taco and the Pork Belly. I found the Pork Belly really dry and hard to swallow while the Baja Fish was ok - I've had better. The Spicy Squid and the Tuna Ceviche were my favourite dishes. I found both pretty fresh, favourful and unique. 

The restaurant itself is cool and in a hip area. I'd recommend trying if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I had the pork belly and fish tacos and one of the slushies from the bar menu. The slushi was EXCELLENT- it had st germain and grand marnier in it but somehow tasted like pear. The tacos were good, but they were akin to eating fire- and I didn't even get the spiciest ones. I understand people like spicy food and if you're reading this and that person is you, COME HERE. But this was a little overwhelming for me. My fiance, on the other hand, who likes spicy food, said that the chicken was crazy. They have a tiiiiiny little 'very' spicy next to the menu item that he joked didn't reflect the degree if spiciness.

The star of the show was the key lime. Good god in heaven, that was delicious."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best tacos I have ever had in my life. Very good price for a taco. We had americna beef cheek enchilada and spicy chciken taco we loved the spicy chicken taco so much we had to order another one we were on a food marathon if we weren't we would've stayed there for a couple more hours. I will definetly come back it's very good price and delicious tacos"}
{"text":"Came with a friend for lunch and was able to try 6 different tacos and both styles of wings (mexi and mission). Tacos were great, the baja fish was amazing, chicken was great and pork belly too. Enjoyed all we had but those were the standouts.  The mexi wings were much better than the mission.  Drinks were good, chili Verde was interesting, really great if you like heat."}
{"text":"2nd time coming here 
Food/drinks were decent but HORRIBLE service 
Attitude from servers and had to order everything twice. Not worth the wait and the music wasn't *that* good
1.5 stars"}
{"text":"Came here on Friday with my better half and it was full. We were told the wait time would be 1hr. So we headed over to porzia next doorfor a few drinks until seats became available. It was really hard to hold off from eating at porzia because the food there looked sooo good (going to have to go back in the near future). 

They tested back about an hour later.  This was my second time and her first. We started off with the guacamole and chips. The chips and guacamole were ok but the salsa that came with it was really really good. 

It was a good start and only got better from there. I had 3 tacos - crispy cauliflower, scrapple and beef cheeks. They were all phenomenal. My favorite was crispy cauliflower and the beef cheeks came in second. It was a party in my mouth with explosive flavors and the right textures. My girlfriend really liked the beef cheeks and then the baja tacos. 

I almost didn't have any dessert but I then I came to my senses! I'm sooo glad I got it! I got the key lime pie. It came in a jar with three layers - Graham cracker crust, key lime filling and the topping which I wasn't sure if it was whipped cream. It was without a doubt the highlight of my night.

I must say though the service could have been better. Our server didn't seem like she wanted to be there."}
{"text":"Only reason I'm going for 4 stars is because in my experience the service has never been phenomenal, and while the music is awesome, it's annoying to barely be able to hold a conversation over how loud it is.  That being said, the food is worth beyond 5 stars.  The menu changes often, but is always fairly tiny and beyond delicious.  It's cheap and easy to try whatever you want since you can order the tacos one by one so not hard to try everything on the menu without blowing that week's paycheque. Huge selection of bourbon, wouldn't reccomend the margartia or other cocktails necessarily but a nice selection of beer.  I haven't had a chance to check out the back patio yet but I can't wait to get out there this summer!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here, fun for an easy date night or meeting up with a few friends. Be prepared to wait to be seated (they'll text you once a table is ready) but the food is quick. I've tried every taco and they're all great, I do find I always order more then I planned on but never disappointed. Highly recommend the fish and beef cheek. I found the shrimp kinda boring."}
{"text":"Ayayayayayyyyy hay muchos tacos deliciosos en el Gran Electrico!!! Seriously yummy especially the fish taco: it gently disintegrates in your mouth leaving behind a subtle taste of Mexican flavours and a feeling of exultation. Second best was the beef shoulder. They were all so good. Definitely want to come back and try more. Great friendly service and lively ambiance, certainly a night-life spot - open till 1am Wed-Sat. Of course such greatness comes at a price, we had to wait 1.5 hours at 9:30pm on a Friday (but there are plenty of hangouts in the area and they take your number and text you when your table is ready). Arriba arriba!!!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere lures you in, for a very fortgettable eating experience.

Old school hip hop, a list of great bourbain, what could go wrong?

Over priced, not very tasty food.

NEXT!"}
{"text":"Got takeout for this place because I've read about all the raving reviews. Let me tell you I was no impressed at all! The food was ok wasn't the best taco I've had.... I don't know what all the hype is about!! Even their guac was \"ok\" accompanied by their over salted chips. Wont be wasting my money here again"}
{"text":"Came here at the end of a night of restaurant/bar hopping. 

Even though I was still full from dinner, I could not pass up having one of their tacos. Wish I could have tried more varieties, but they were sold out of some of their selection. If you have a chance, try their specials!

The space was small, dark, not the best if you have a large group. But great if it's only 2-4 people."}
{"text":"This is a small little place that's is always busy! Finally got in here and was not disappointed. Small Mexican tapas style menu. Delicious vegetarian mushroom and cauliflower tacos. Tuna ceviche had a nice twist. Baja and Americano taco were fabulous. Best of all real key lime pie. That was a real treat and wonderfully delicious."}
{"text":"Great Tacos! Very interesting Bourbon list as well. Wish they take reservations!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my meal here! I had the beef cheek, and spicy chicken tacos. Both were excellent but the beef cheek was probably my favourite, it was super flavourful. We also shared the chips and dip, which was awesome. Guac was great but I actually liked the bean dip more. I tasted my friend's broccoli- it was one of the daily specials. The flavour was delicious at first but a bit too intense. I wouldn't have been able to have more than a few bites. I loved that they gave a huge assortment of hot sauces. We had lots of fun taste testing all of them. Service was also great. We had to ask for water refills, and they spilled something on my friend's clothing, but they were so friendly and helpful it didn't matter."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here for a date and the 1 hour wait was well worth it for the food! One of the best Mexican spots in the city for great value. The music is a bit loud for a conversation but overall great vibe and environment along with amazing food and large selection of drinks. I'm a fan and would recommend this spot to anyone."}
{"text":"Food tasted great but the experience overall wasn't.

It seems like Grand Electric doesn't actually want your business and that you're inconveniencing them with your presence.

Service was rude and abrupt, tables were tiny, seating was cramped, tacos disintegrated, food was overpriced, menus posted on the wall are hard to read, and music was so loud that conversation was made impossible.

Also, no credit cards is really annoying.

P.S. The tines on all of our forks were completely bent. This is acceptable at the IKEA cafeteria, but not at places where I am paying for a real meal."}
{"text":"The most delicious tacos! I think the chorizo is my fave! The crispy squid is also so tasty as an appetizer. Don't go with a large group due to the small size of the place, but place is a must for taco lovers!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! 

Rather,  their food is..... I bought the chips and dip last night to take away and boy was I satisfied and happy with my selection. Hand made Tortilla chips, which taste so fresh, spicy salsa, a real full container of guacamole, some refried beans with a little bit of cheese on top - warm and delicious, the onions they had that came with this wasn't my forté.  They had a certain flavour, I did not enjoy. 

In terms of their ambiance, I wasn't a fan... small and kinda crampy. A full house last night  made for no available seats for take-out orderiees. Their music was loud. I can't imagine eating there, I would think it would be difficult to hear those seated across from you. 

The service was great, greeted with a smile and asked if I wanted to see the menu... Although, I knew what I desired. Due to the noise it felt like I had to talk in the servers ear. 
The server who handed me my order when it was done was awesome... She knew that the order was for me and I didn't even order through her. Psychic, and alert. I think so! 

They have a map describing the bible versus.. Interesting decor perhaps, but for someone who is not religious... this did not resonate with me. However, I also understand that with so many different people and their preferences. It's hard to be able to accommodate everyone's beliefs without having spaces be governed by all these discourse politics (some already are). 

on the upside, I'd definitely return to try their tacos.... Probably another take-out order though."}
{"text":"Only good think on the menu is the Baja Fish Tacos.

Ambiance: (3 stars)
Came here on a Tuesday night at 7:30, the place was pretty busy, with one table empty.  The whole place has a cozy feeling to it, but a bit worn out.  The washrooms are located in the basement, and are down really steeps steps with everything needing a bit of an update.

Service: (5 stars)
The servers are very attentive, constantly re-filling our glasses with water (from the bottle that is on our table).  

Food: (3 stars)
For the starter we got Guac and Chips - it was ok, nothing specular.  (3 stars)
We ordered the Baja Fish Tacos: These were by the the biggest tacos this place has to offer.  Well balance texture and taste of warm fish with crispy cold cabbage.  I would recommend these (5 stars)
We also ordered, pork, mushroom and chorizo tacos: all of these were disappointing (2 stars).   They gave a very small portion of protein, which made the tacos main taste come from the double taco shell.  The chorizo, which is made in house was extremely tasty, but in the taco it felt a bit dry.  

cool thing: they got Coca Cola from Mexico."}
{"text":"Best Tacos I've ever had. Well worth arriving early and standing in line to get in. These little treasures pack quite the punch! The bad part is that it's so delicious I end up spending more money than I need to, and leave feeling super full. Each time I have been I have always ordered seconds.... the place is dangerous! But delicious."}
{"text":"The only improvement needed is their taco shells. If they are going to use the authentic thin/soft shells they should really double layer them like an authentic taco joint. Other than that this is my favorite taco place. The choices are fantastic but not too many, so it's easier to decide...and they are all done to a perfection of flavor. Yum yum. If you're planning on coming later in the day, get ready to line up for hours."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Nice atmosphere. Tables, Bar, or Patio means that it can work for families or just grabbing a drink. We enjoyed all the drinks and tacos but the paloma (cocktail) and fish tacos were our favorites. I wish they used two tortillas per taco or maybe slightly larger (but still corn!) tortillas would have been less messy. Good guac and chips too. We shall return!"}
{"text":"I love tacos, and this place serves 3 veggie tacos:
1. cauliflower
2. mushroom
3. yams
All are delicious! Cauliflower is my new hot favourite. The taste is so fresh and subtle. they are crispy and flavorful, perfectly spiced. Apart from tacos, there are several vegetarian options, broccoli in soy was good too. Their drinks are not to be missed. The nachos and guac are a delight. 

GE serves the best veggie tacos in the 6 :P"}
{"text":"Great tacos and margaritas in a great neighbourhood.  The back patio is a gem in the summer months.  I just wish they still had the pork belly al pastor taco!  It was a shame to take it off the menu..."}
{"text":"One star removed for feeling like we were consistently being pushed out the door, despite the fact that it was 5:30 on a Tuesday and my date and I arrived early so that we could enjoy ourselves without being rushed. That said, the spot was small and really ecclectic. A hipster's dream.  The tacos could only be described as little flavour bombs. They're small but they pack a powerful punch - definitely quality over quantity, and that's a good thing folks. We tried the spicy chicken, beef shoulder and Scrapple. I can't remember exactly what Scrapple was, but it was by far my favourite. So just order it. Seriously.

For dessert we tried the Key Lime (self-explanatory) and Electric Dirt. The latter was my favourite, a chocolate mousse with crumbled chocolate cookie layers above and below, starting creamy and ending with a combined black-chili pepper kick. Very different and very tasty.  

I wouldn't show up here starving, but for $3.60 a piece you could easily indulge in several of these puppies and not break the bank. Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't necessarily pick it for a date spot - it was possible to speak over the loud hip hop playing, but consistently being interrupted by the server so they can drop the bill on the table as soon as possible is not ideal.  If anything, go early, have a bite and head across the street to Rhino's patio for some after dinner imbibing."}
{"text":"worth the hype !!! This time around we went for lunch after an unsuccessful previous attempt at getting a table for dinner service. It was quite busy although it was rainy day. The place has a hipster vibe and the music is quite loud. The tables are in close proximity to each other and are quite small. The good part is that they bring a bunch of tacos on a single plate which makes compensates for the small table space. We tried a bunch of tacos and it was hard to pick a favorite. I don't even eat pork all that much but I loved the scrapple and pork tinga, the latter we ended up ordering twice. All the food is very light and packs a punch with the flavors. We also had the fried squid sandwich which was quite juicy. I just hope they expand their space so that they can accommodate more diners, it's been quite frustrating going all the way only to realize that there is a 2 hour wait. They deliver now which would be a good option in the winter, on the other hand I am not sure how it will taste when it is packaged. We will definitely come back again !!!"}
{"text":"place is awesome. i'll give it 3.5 stars.

however, not too fond of the location, and very noisy inside--loud music.

baja tacos are the best things to get. definitely not worth any lineup though. luckily was able to miss it, as we went during lunch time at an odd hour, around 3 or 4.

tacos were well priced.  comparatively, i have also ordered the mahi mahi taco 2/$9 from gourmet gringos food truck. and grand electric is much better in both flavour and cost @3.60$. 

our server was awesome, patient with us, and good explanation for the questions we had.

wasn't fond of the tuna ceviche, raw tuna salad?"}
{"text":"This place is mostly hype. Reputation precedes the actual experience

The food is good but portions are small and it's over priced for what it is.

The worst part is the blaring rap. I like rap music but it's just obnoxious. Hard to have a conversation without yelling

Definitely feels like a \"scenester\" type of restaurant, not a lot of depth. 

I mean, it's fun if you're into it. I can see the appeal

Just not my cup of tea. Won't be back. Too many other great spots to be without trying to be a cool kid on the block."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food and the atmosphere! Best tacos in Toronto hands down. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for tacos and bourbon.  If you like a variety of mexican yums and have a taste for bourbon sours you will definitely be here more often than not.  I can see why there's always a line up outside.  Definitely worth checking out at least once...ok maybe twice. =op"}
{"text":"Came here for a Sunday night dinner date and it was a pleasant experience. 

The two of us split a Tuna Cevice and 4 tacos- pork carnita, pork belly, shrimp, mushroom. The amount of food was almost enough-- I think if we each ordered one more taco, or if we shared another dish, it would have been just perfect. 

The ceviche was really nice and tasty. Just the right amount of sweet and citrusy. The tacos were alright. My favourites were the shrimp taco and the mushroom taco. I don't know if I just don't like tacos but I've never ever ordered tacos from anywhere and thought, \"wow, now THIS is what all the hype is about\". With regards to the tacos here- the fillings were all very very tasty, I just found that there was too much \"bread\" in each bite. I will admit that I am a huge taco n00b so take my critique as you see fit. 

Overall, it was a nice night out. The service was friendly and I have no complaints. If I were to come back, I would skip the tacos and order more mains!"}
{"text":"Compared to NYC tacos, I think this place is overrated. The chips were too salty and too fried, the tacos weren't as great as I thought it would be. Nothing else to say. 
Probably better off going somewhere else. :/ sorry Toronto, your tacos weren't great."}
{"text":"There is currently a lot of hype around this place and I can see why! The one caution is you will have to wait and for a very long time. Like 2 or 3 hours, because they don't take reservations so you will need to come at 6pm to put your name on a list. However if you prepare for that and are willing to grab a drink until then, (the Rhino across the street has super cheap drinks!) it will be worth the wait! This place is not someone you're take your mom to unless your mom is into loud hip hop music, but a great place to go on a date or with friends. The menu is very reasonably priced (ie $3 per taco!) and the food is ridiculously good. Packed with flavor you can't go wrong. We had the nachos with homemade guacamole, insanely good ceviche and incredible tacos that you can pick the filling and they are all delicious! It's a fun place and the service is great, the staff are super friendly, and they are as accommodating as they can be with a tiny restaurant and high demand. Good news is they are expanding and building a patio."}
{"text":"Got a seat right away but service was slow to attendee to me, the menu looks awesome but the food took a long time to come out and when I saw the portion sizes for the price there was no saving grace. They tasted ok the spice over powers their dishes and there is so much grease everything just falls apart. Skip here and go to Wilbur instead."}
{"text":"Grabbed lunch here with some friends on their recommendation. 

As others have mentioned, this place is LOUD from open to close. Make sure to charge your phones before stopping in so that you're able to text the rest of your party. 

Example texts from our visit: 
- \"can u pass the salt?\" 
- \"want another drink? i think he's coming back???\"

The atmosphere is relaxed and casual overall. There's a slight pretentious vibe from the staff and decor, but it's a hipster paradise so it's more or less to be expected. I can get behind that when you back it up with good food. 

We were lucky to grab the last table before the wait started, but had to squeeze ourselves into the table next to the bar. We ordered tacos (duh) and ended up trying the spicy chicken ($3.95), spicy yam ($3.50), crispy cauliflower ($3.50), and chorizo and queso ($3.75). Everyone in the group was eager to try the pork belly ($3.95), but they were sold out so I guess we weren't alone.   

Since we were near the bar, the bartender ended up being our waiter. I'm not sure how normal this practice is, but it made our overall service a little on the \"meh\" side, since he was busy presenting an astonishing one-man mixology show to the group seated at the bar.   

Also, if you've got any picky eaters in your party, be warned: they won't make modifications to your order. One of my friends wanted to leave an ingredient off one of the tacos and you'd think we were asking the bartender to walk across a bed of hot coals. 

The tacos themselves didn't disappoint, despite the fact that we had a few more toppings on them than we'd have liked. The prices do add up, so keep that in mind if you've got an especially hungry crowd.

We'll be back to check this place out again though -- hopefully with more pork belly and less attitude."}
{"text":"The tacos are good. Apparently you will need to wait for over an hour if you come here in the evening. We came here for lunch. No line up and the service is fast and good.

We really like the fish taco, cauliflower taco, spicy chicken taco and pull pork taco. El Gordito taco was interesting but not my favorite. 

The vibe of the whole place is very hipster. They also have a large selection of the bourbon. I would imagining it would be very popular for dinners. 

The menu tend to be on the expensive side, so if you are here for the quantity, look some where else. The taco itself for each is about $3.50 something, so it won't fill you up, but you taste the quality of the work.

I would come back here but mostly for special occasions."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on Friday night and despite the guaranteed wait for a table, I love the food here!  Two of us arrived around 7:30 p.m. and were told the wait would be an hour.  The hostess took my cell number and informed us that I would receive a text when a table was available.  Although we went to a bar close by for a drink to pass the time, our table was surprisingly available in thirty minutes.  We were seated this time at the bar at the front of the restaurant.  As mentioned in many reviews, the music is loud in the front so I was actually glad we were seated side-by-side at the bar rather than a table.  However, if more than two people it will definitely be difficult to have a conversation.

Everything I have ordered here has always been great; nothing has disappointed yet.  I recommend the tuna cerviche and spicy squid to start and share.  The spicy squid in particular should be a must try.  For tacos, no matter where I go, if I order fish tacos, I always compare it to GE; no other place I have tried makes better fish tacos than GE!  Other favourites are the pig tail and pork belly tacos.  Some menu items and tacos are also not always offered.  For dessert, the key lime pie is fantastic - I have to order this every time!  It is enough to share between two people.

I hate the wait for a table, but I do love Grand Electric; I will wait for a reasonable amount of time but I do refuse to wait 3 hours which can be the case (I have been told twice previously on weekends)!  Also, despite some reviews, I have never had any issues with service; they have been attentive and friendly.  This is one place where the food hype won't disappoint for a casual night of good eats!"}
{"text":"The BEST tacos I've ever had. I have had many. My husband, toddler, friend and I enjoyed every last bite!"}
{"text":"Came on a Wednesday around 6, and we were seated right away. Ordered 6 tacos, ranging from meh to very tasty.

The ingredients are all very fresh, and you can taste it. My favourite was the chorizo and queso, and my girlfriend preferred the baja fish. The roast pork taco was very spicy; a little warning would've been nice. The beef cheek taco is a bit too sweet. The pulled pork and shrimp tacos were just okay.

Between the weird dressing and what I imagine are called something like \"simulated soy bacon bits,\" the kale caesar was mediocre at best. We didn't finish it, and it was not at all worth $12.

The key lime pie was a pleasant surprise, if a bit on the small side. I was expecting frozen grocery store pie, but it appeared to be made in-house. The alcoholic slushie drinks (~$10) were fine, but overpriced.

Service was good. Total was $80 with tax and tip. Kind of pricey for the quality of the meal. I'd go back and order more of those delicious chorizo and queso tacos, though."}
{"text":"I don't know - waiting 3 hours with a catty hostess just isn't worth the cheap taco prices.

I have tried a few of their dishes since my boyfriend and friends really like this place, I like the Baja Fish and the octopus. However, I find that they're okay, good. But not mind blowing good. Also, I've realized I really dislike bourbon - and I've tried different types here and in New Orleans, just not a drink I enjoy. SO to me, it's not worth it. 
However, I can see if bourbon and cheap tacos are your thing, then this is your place to be.

I might consider them for takeout - and probably update my review.
Bonus points for the great hip-hop playlist they got going on."}
{"text":"Fina-fucking-ly
This place is extremely popular. 
I went here four times before actually eating here. Once it was closed and three other times the wait was over 2.5 hours. So yesterday, i made it at 6.15pm (15 mins after open) to get a quote of again...2.5 hours. Determined that i wanted to finally eat here, i chose to starve in anticipation. 

The point really is, if you want to eat here, your evening must be planned around this main activity. And stay close to your phone waiting like you would after a first date. 

So is it worth it? Hell's yeah.

I love the flavours of raw chili and cilantro - and you will find this on every dish. I found it interesting that even though this is a mexcian menu, you could taste hints of thailand and indonesia in the dishes. I don't know if this was intended, or if this is just my personal take. 

The dish that stood out to me and is memorable in my mind is the beef tustado which really is a tar tar but it was great. The tacos are all good too (shout out to beef cheecks), the tuna ceviche is good too (i would have personally done without the dairy component) and the chicken fritto is perhaps the most filling of the dishes, but my least favourite (a little too asian sweet tasting for my liking). 

But all in all, the place would get five out of five for me, had it been bigger (less wait). The interior is dark, light woods, very bourbon inspired. The food is excellent and service is great. Fast. And let's get serious, this place is so cheap its value surpassess what it delivers."}
{"text":"i loveeee this place! minus the 1 hour+ wait time to get a spot everything else is amazzzzzzzing. for not even 20 bucks per person you can leave this place full and satisfied. every taco explodes with flavour and they're so cheap too. my favourite is the baja fish taco... but then again.. fish tacos are always my favourite"}
{"text":"++
- Always packed, which is a good sign
- Chicken taco wasn't that spicy, which is good for me...it was tasty too, as a added bonus

- Guacamole was adequate, I feel it could be better
- Wife enjoyed baja fish taco"}
{"text":"I came here one afternoon on my own to try this place out.  I came multiple times over the summer but the wait times were too long.  This possibly could of been a self made mission - but I'm glad I gave this place a go.

I sat at the bar as the place was packed at 3 pm on a weekday afternoon.  I gazed around at all the options and the bar set up.  I liked the casual/hip vibe of the place.  I ordered one of everything - 6 tacos in total.  Some were also sold out.  I paired my lunch with a bourbon lemonade. It was fantastic.  The tacos themselves were also fantastic - I felt like this venture was a success as I ordered another round of tacos.  I even ordered a little dessert which the name escapes me now, but it was delicious.  I left full, a little tipsy from the bourbon and very happy with the experience."}
{"text":"Grand Electric has gotten a lot of hype in the city over the last few years. Enough hype that it's probably challenging to deliver on such high expectations. Sat down for an early dinner on a Friday evening and it's fair to say everything was delicious, but didn't live up to the hype. Opted for some tacos, chips and dip, and the chicken wings. Highlights were definitely in the tacos, specifically the shrimp. Everything was fresh and flavorful. The pork belly and beef cheek were also perfectly tender, and super rich. In a city full of taco places it tough to stand out, but I'd definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"I live in the area and popped in here on a whim with my boyfriend on a Friday night. We only had to wait 15 minutes so we had a quick beer at a bar close by, came back, and were seated right away. 

We ordered some Electric Lagers to sip on as we took a peep at the taco selection. We started with two orders each of the baja fish, spicy arbol chicken, beef cheek, and shrimp. We loved all of them and you could really taste the freshness of the ingredients. My boyfriend even enjoyed the beef cheek and he's a guy who is iffy about these sort of things. The spicy arbol chicken was delightfully spicy and the shrimp tacos were great, but the standout for me was the baja fish. The fish was perfectly crispy and the sauce was very tasty. 

I don't know if it was because I had just gotten over the flu or if the tacos were exceptional, but I could not stop eating. We ordered two more orders of the baja fish and shrimp and then decided to cut ourselves off. 

We sat at the bar and the bartender taking care of us was absolutely lovely, but I was made uncomfortable by the hostess when we first showed up...like I was not worthy. I'm from New York so I'm used to that sort of constant abuse by strangers, but for such a cool spot with great food, that sort of attitude just seems out of place."}
{"text":"VIBE 
After a year, the GE needs a refresher. GE is like the guy you really like but you don't say anything because you don't want to offend him but more importantly you want the affection. This is exactly how I feel about GE's lineup/wait situation.

Does it suck to have to subway it an hour from Yonge and Eg to be told that you have to wait an hour (legitimately) and go to the Rhino to have some fries, only to not have everything you wanted at GE because you had to wait? Yes. I get it. It's not their fault they're popular and they're expanding and doing the lunch on weekend from time to time too. So we're cool. 

Same ol' crowds. Same ol' loud hip hop. Service is still kind of en point (more on that later). 

WE ATE 
The tacos. Good. Standard. The cactus is a new addition. YUM. Baja is still tops in my books. 

This time I had pozole rojo. Wow! It doesn't look hearty but you're getting more than enough for $7. Well worth it. The chips give it a good crunch too. 

For dessert, they had options: key lime (which I should have gotten again and trusted my instinct); hell cake and tres leches. I asked the bartender what she recommended and out of the three she said tres leches. For some reason, I thought she said there was chocolate in it (maybe it was the loud music that was making me deaf) so I was disappointed when it was a sponge apple cake in a mason jar. I visibly did not like it. I didn't like it so much that I scrunched my face. When I don't like something, you do NOT want to see this face! 

My friend is a keen observer and Ms. Passive Agressive hid! She could have asked \"how was it?\" but didn't want to confront the situation. No-one asked how it was, so I didn't tell them nor did they give me the time to. This is where the service has gone down. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
GE really is one of the best restaurants in the city but there's a reason I only go every six months. This has confirmed it. I'll be ok with my craving and get my tacos at Seven Lives and at Big Star when I go to Chicago (which I'm very interested to compare as Colin Tooke worked there before opening GE)."}
{"text":"We came to Grand Electric on a recommendation. The place is tucked away on Queen street, in a small but cool space. The decor is pretty simple, and the menu is straight forward and well rounded. We started with guac, which was well seasoned, and I loved the fact that the chips are cooked fresh to order and were hot. I tried 4 tacos, but the beef was by far the best followed by the fish. My only complaint was the music, it was WAY to loud even for a music buff like me."}
{"text":"A very cute authentic style mexican restaurant with good food and drinks. The ceviche is totally worth it. Quite a few taco flavors and some specials. Decent drink menu. The food was all good, especially the baja fish tacos. Fresh tortillas and chips - guac was also pretty good. As the other reviews suggest this place is pretty small, not good for parties and also not great for dates (as you will probably have to sit next to someone you don't know)... Server was nice and made good recommendations."}
{"text":"I thought LA carnitas tacos were bigger and more moist. The beef cheek was quite dry and the pork belly didn't really taste like pork belly. The music is just too insanely loud. They can turn it down one and still force ppl to leave quickly. Also the tacos are smaller. Tuna ceviche is very good. Next time will skip the Electric dirt. The dessert was v average."}
{"text":"Best tacos ever!!! We (a group of 5) waited for about 40 minutes, but it was definitely worth it! The food and drinks' menus are written on chalkboards, so if you're sitting far..you ought to take a picture on your phone and order that way. We wanted to try all of the tacos, since the reviews were so great! We ordered the spicy chicken, the beef, the shredded pork, baja fish, tuna ceviche and the spicy squid. Everything tasted amazing! I've been to other taco places in Toronto and their tacos tasted pretty bland. Here, there is an explosion of flavour the second you take a bite. Each table has a bunch of hot sauces for those who need them, but I certainly didn't. I thought the chicken and the squid were super spicy, but not so much as to take away from the taste. I have no complaints. The staff was really nice, as they kept checking up and refilling the bottles of water (free at each table!). The only thing I guess I would say that was a bit off was the loudness of the music inside. They were playing some old school rap, which was pretty funny and entertaining, but it was just too loud in my opinion. Nevertheless, that should never deter you away from this place. Come try their tacos!!!"}
{"text":"We had to wait two hours on a Wednesday night to get in but it was a nice summer evening and there are interesting things to do in the neighborhood.

The food doesn't live up to its hype. I tried all the tacos: really enjoyed the spicy chicken, beef cheek and pork belly: very flavorful. Rest were ok. I didn't like the taste of their soft taco. Loved their bourbon sour: so smooth and delicious. 

Their service is good, though our server did seem to want to give us our bill at various points even before we had finished our meal. But in all fairness, we kept ordering in fits and starts. 

The music is waaaay tooo loud for an eating establishment.

I had a decent time, though I think Grand Electric verges a bit on the we're-oh-so-nonchalantly-cool-pretentious. There's definitely better Mexican food to be had in the city.

 I am going with 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"i've been a more than few places in toronto for tacos.   this place makes the best.  variety, freshness and taste are unmatched.  try everything.

service is decent.  the food comes out a bit slow though.  ambiance is okay.  music is good."}
{"text":"Small cozy restaurant. We absolutely loved it. We had brunch on a Sunday, was seated immediately at the bar. They had a patio as well! Amazing food! Okay service considering how busy they got. Will definitely come back. 
Try the special menu!"}
{"text":"Be forewarned - do not try to come here if you are hungry because you are looking at a wait. A long wait. We went on a Wednesday night at 6:40 to put out names on the list, and were seated about 2 hours later (Wednesday...table of 2....2 hours....that's what you are in for).

That being said, this place is really fun.

The food is excellent. Tried the tuna ceviche and lots o' tacos - pork belly, baha fish, beef cheek, chicken, and pig tail. All pretty darn delicious (although the chicken one wasn't as special as the rest). The pig tail was my favorite. Perfectly tender and melt in your mouth. And the baja fish taco is a nice counterbalance - light and fresh.

Had the Grand Electric Sour to drink. Tasted like bourbon. Therefore, good!

The bill came to maybe $50 which included 2 drinks. Totally a great value for your money and I left stuffed.

P.S. My bf raved about the music. All classic golden-age 90's hip hop. This place is just good vibes all around and makes the unpleasentness of the wait just melt away."}
{"text":"Baja fish is not bad, the carnitas too, except well you can't really fuck that one up. Was it tasty? Yeah. Is it worth the hype? definitely no. The tacos are mini sized, I need at least 5 to feel full, expect at least 35 dollars per person. Taqueria food for tapas price is a Toronto thing, where we just settle for second class efforts. No need to talk about Mexico, any cheap Taqueria in mission and 16th in SF blow the \"best in Toronto\" out of water flavor wise, and there you leave full with less than 10 dollars spent.

The service was like \"I don't really care\", and that's exactly how I feel about this place too."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this hotspot for awhile. But I was always put off by the horror stories of friends who waited over 3 hours to get in. And who wants to eat at 530 anyways unless you're a senior? 

But last weekend, I found myself, with a friend visiting from NY, sometime between late lunch and early dinner under the shady trees of Trinity Bellwoods Park. We were ready to eat and chill on a sunny patio. Being the first in line at the coveted Grand Electric seemed like a brilliant idea and a good place to impress a New Yorker.

With hunger and anticpation, we arrived at 6pm on a Saturday to find that we weren't the only ones with this same idea. But the line went fast and we easily scored a great table on the newly opened and lively patio. Everybody seemed to be in an upbeat and relaxed mood.

The atmosphere is a lot of fun and great for people watching. Our waitress was stylish, sweet, and adorable. The menu is small, but everything was fresh, homemade, authentic, and delicious and well priced too. I tried the lime beef ribs, hot off the barbeque. And my friend had 3 tacos (2 fish and 1 pork). He literally refused to share with me. But out of jealousy (and glutony), I got my own fish taco and it was good (even though batter isn't normally my thing). Our margaritas were the perfect summer drink for the patio, just the right mix between sweet and tart. I was too full to try anything else, but next time I'd try the ceviche, more tacos, and whatever is on the barbeque. The keylime custard/pie looked like a happy ending too. And now that there's the patio, no one should have to wait 3 hours ever again for a fun, hip mexican dinner!"}
{"text":"On a short return trip to Toronto, Grand Electric was on my to-do list. The last time I was here, there were lineups to get in but today it was a casual stroll to the back patio.

Beef cheek, pork carnitas, and the baja fish tacos were just as good as I remember them. There is a nice assortment of drinks and I'm rather fond of the Electric lager on tap as a summer time drink.

But the showstopper is the Spicy Squid Tostada! If this was served as an appetizer, it would be among my favourite dishes of all time. Holy frak!

Upbeat atmosphere and a glorious wait staff. Grand Electric is a true gem in Parkdale."}
{"text":"The tacos were delicious, my issue is with the VOLUME of the music. It is ABSOLUTELY OBNOXIOUS! It's obvious they do it so people eat and go, but COME ON. We are spending money in your establishment, you literally can't even hear the person sitting across from you."}
{"text":"I've been to Grand Electric twice and both times I had a blast! Music was awesome, food was great and came out quick, drinks were well priced (especially the shot special each day, $4 bourbon on Friday!). The only thing I noticed was that the service didn't seem too friendly but it was towards the end of the night and as someone in the service industry I can understand. Overall fun place to grab a few drinks and a couple of tacos with a friend or a date."}
{"text":"I love the baja fish tacos at Grand Electric. Many disagree with me and argue that La Carnita makes a better fish taco.  I guess to each their own.

When I make the trek to Queen West I make sure that I plan a visit to both, Chantecler (they have the most amazing fish lettuce wraps) and Grand Electric. Since you can make a reservation at Chantecler online, I always plan it so that I put my name on the waitlist at Grand Electric on my way to my reservation at Chantecler, and because I am usually with a group of 5+ people, I have 1 hour + to dine at Chantecler before my table is ready at Grand Electric. In the past I have found the staff at Grand Electric to be on the cocky side - it always felt like they were doing you a favor by taking down your name for a table. That they were \"the shit\" and you should feel privileged to be allowed entrance into their castle - per-se. This Saturday however, I was very pleasantly surprised by the service. At 5:55pm I walked into a busy Grand Electric and asked the lady at the door (from this point forward she will be called \"Cool Girl\") if she could place me on the waitlist for a table for 6. She took down my name, phone number, and quoted 7pm as the time the table would be ready. I then walked over to Chantecler to meet my friends (Chantecler is located only a few doors down  - east of Grand Electric). At 7:30pm I checked my phone concerned that I had missed the text from Grand Electric, telling me that our table was ready, but there was no text. So I put on my coat and walked over to check-in on my reservation. I asked Cool Girl if she had the correct number, and she told me that she had texted me 45 minutes earlier, and showed me the number she had on file. Turned out that the number she had was incorrect. So she took down the correct number and profusely apologized for the mistake and inconvenience. I kept telling her that it was no problem, and that my friends and I were dining somewhere else anyway, so there was no rush. At this time she quoted me 30 minutes - so 8pm. At 7:50pm she texted me an update - that it would be a little longer because the people at the table that was meant for us, had just ordered another round of tacos. So my friends and I decided to grab a coffee and wait. At 8:15pm I was texted that our table was ready. As soon as we arrived, Cool Girl once again apologized and showed us to our table - the best table in the house as far as I am concerned - the bench by the window that sits 6 people perfectly. I love this table because you get a decent amount of light, and it is quieter. What I dislike about it is that it is by the door, so on a cold evening you get the cold draft, and when people are waiting for a table, they often bump into you when you are eating. On this particular evening several of my friends had to politely ask that people to move away as they were hovering over them while they were trying to eat.

Whenever I am with friends that have never been to Grand Electric, I encourage them to get at least one fish taco. And lucky for me, they always love them as much as I do. This time around one friend ordered the guacamole and chips, and I fell in love with the chips. Generally tortilla chips taste the same to me, regardless of where I order them, but what separates the chips at Grand Electric from the rest is that they have a hint of lime. Something that seems so simple - the addition of lime - takes what could be considered a simple and boring dish, to another level - a memorable level. Yes, I know that Grand Electric sells more than just fish tacos, or tacos for that matter, but since I hate onions, and love their fish tacos, I don't see the point of trying anything else. If I could get them to omit the onions, I would probably try their pork belly taco since I love pork belly! But until I get sick of the fish tacos (I don't think that is even possible), I will hold off on trying anything else.

Next time you are in the Parkdale area, I encourage you to try the fish wrap at Chantecler, and then the fish taco at Grand Electric! Make it a mini food tour!"}
{"text":"A few months back while on a flight to Boston, i was perusing their in flight magazine.  They mentioned new restaurants in cities all across North America, and the Toronto spotlight was on Grand Electric.  I had the opportunity to come and see what all of the fuss was about this past weekend.  Frequenting the states many times throughout the year i am constantly trying Mexican food, especially taco's, making me somewhat of a connoisseur, which was why i was so amped to see what they were serving at Grand electric, especially since they don't have a menu posted.  Grand electric is pretty far down Queen, verging on Roncessvales territory, but apparently the city knows whats up, because this place was packed.  We came here on a Saturday night and waited 30 minutes, which is pretty standard.  We were lucky enough to get seats out on their uncovered patio (this note will make more sense later).  To start i ordered a margarita and my sis had the bourbonade, both drinks were priced at $8.  My margarita was great, my only complaint was that they served it in a highball glass.  The whole point of a margarita is to get a bit of salt in every swig, since the glass was so small in diameter, all of the salt was gone before i was only half finished my bevy.  
We started the meal with guac and chips, and they were ridiculous.  The chips were salty and they also tasted of lime, they were super fresh.  The guac was amazing, and the salsa that accompanied it was super spicy and paired really well with the guac.  
Taco's traditionally utilize odd cuts of meat, and at Grande Electric they honour that tradition.  We had pigs tail taco's on corn tortillas with pickled onions and cilantro.  The meat was tender and stewed and extremely flavourful.  We also had the baja fish taco with coleslaw and radish atop.  The preparation for the fish wasn't traditional, it was fried, it was more reminiscent to fish and chips than a taco.  However the the batter was light and the fish was flaky.  The taco's are $3.50 which is reasonable, however most taco places in the states usually charge about $2.50.  I found that the shells were too small to hold the large amount of filling.  It becomes quite messy and falls apart which defeats the purpose of being street food.  
I was stoked for the spicy squid, since this is one of my favourites types of seafood, but i was so disappointed.  Most people don't like the texture of squid, however i like the chew, this was so tender verging on mushy.  The squid was sliced in rings and battered, however the coating just disappeared because they were sauced so heavily.  The whole dish was a miss from me for texture, flavour and the whole concept.
We ended on a high note which was dessert.  It was a key lime pie served in a jar.  It consisted of a layer of Graham crumbs, with key lime  curd on top, and finished with whipped cream.  It was light, tart, and satisfying, it is also perfect to share.
While eating, we were well aware that it was going to rain, it was just a matter of time.  The patio isn't covered, so the servers were handing out umbrellas, and that is a nice touch, but lets be real, who wants to eat tacos' while holding an umbrella.  
I really liked the service at grand electric, they truly work together as a team.  Throughout the course of the evening, we interacted with probably 4 servers.  
A few additional notes are that if you do not finish your meal, they do not have takeout containers, so u have to wrap up your food in tinfoil.  Also they just accept cash and debit, no credit cards.

Overall, the restaurant serves top knotch Mexican, the staff are super friendly, we we sent off by each staffer on our way out in a genuine manner.  As great as the food and ambiance are, it would be that much better with a covered patio, the ability to take home your food in appropriate containers, and also accepting all forms of payment."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. The service was friendly and quick, the food was amazing, and it's not that expensive. For sure coming back."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on Friday night, and was skeptical of all of the hype. 

We ended up having  GREAT experience here.. mostly due to wonderful, friendly, well trained and professional service, especially for such a relaxed and laid back atmosphere.

The food is also excellent... everything was deep fried and mayo and sour cream laden.. but fried  and spiced perfectly and not greasy or overwhelming.  We had almost every taco and the spicy squid appetizer (my favorite!). My friend and I agreed that the el Pastor tacos were the best.. but all were very tasty. 

The atmosphere is great.. very casual and backyard- picnic combined with a drive in movie (the menu!) kind of feel, definitely not upscale, but unique and comfortable. 

You most likely WILL have to sit at a communal table with complete strangers, which was ok & fun for us, but might not be for some. 

Anyway, the highlight of the place for me was the kindness of the waitstaff (in a city where most trendy places tend to come with attitude laden restaurant staffs)."}
{"text":"Some of my favourite tacos in the city. When I'm craving this is where I head - the beef cheek and baja fish tacos are my favourite with the tuna tostadas a close tie. The guac is decent but mildly overpriced for the amount (though having made my own guac many times I understand it is a feat of it's own). 
The atmosphere is awesome although the music can be a BIT too loud too early - I was there on a Friday at 7 one time and I couldn't hear my friend at all - maybe they should save the volume for after 11. The staff have been prudish every time I have been there with only one waitress being pleasant - what's the deal? If I was rating the staff they would get MAYBE one star. 

Overall I'm learning to block out the rude staff because I need to satisfy my taco cravings."}
{"text":"Back home visiting Toronto and I'm afraid that my reviews might tend to be overrated. I was waffling between 4 and 5 stars, but when that happens I let the food speak to whether it goes up or down. The food here was fantastic. I loved everything I tasted and being a party of 4 and adventurous, we tried a lot of the menu. The standouts for me were the pork tinga and baha fish tacos.

The only thing that's a miss for me is the extremely loud music. I don't like having to scream to my dining companions just to be heard. Thankfully, I didn't have to endure the previously mentioned long line-ups."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. They have a taco menu which was pretty affordable. Other menu items looked good too, though I didn't get a chance to try any. Their vanilla bourbon sour was quite delicious. They have an extensive bourbon menu.

The table by the door caught all the cold air every time it opened.

This place had a really long line up even before it opened! It MUST be good, we thought. It was good but I don't think it's worth waiting over an hour to get in."}
{"text":"I don't think I have ever been to a more three star place in my life. The food is ok and just ok with the service precisely matching the overall unexceptionalness of the rest of the experience. While palatable, the beef cheek is too sweet, and it lacks texture and substance. Nothing about it stands out. It's the same story with the chicken and chorizo. The ceviche was the star of the evening but even that was not particularly stellar. While different people have different preferences, I feel that the tuna chunks were way too large and the slaw had too much sauce. For desert we had the poted caramel and it was repeat of the tacos. It was not well tied together. The cream did not connect with the caramel which had a buttery but very bland texture. The caramel itself was starchy and while it had close to the right amount of saltiness, it was not sweet enough to tie it together. I was expecting more for the amount of hype around this place."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for tacos.  I just love them.  And Grand Electric makes killer tacos. The tequila selection isn't outstanding and the volume of the place could stand to be turned down a couple notches but all and all this place makes the cut for one my local taco spots."}
{"text":"Grand slam for this taco joint! Lots of veggie options here which I love! The tacos are quite small so keep that in mind if you have a large appetite and order accordingly. Also they don't come with guac so make sure you get some on the side if you're an addict like me :)

I also recommend the coconut cream pie for dessert!"}
{"text":"I am very, very late to the Grand Electric train. I ordered the carnitas (pork) taco and grilled, spicy squid tostada...The carnitas was deep fried and the tostada was a deep fried shell. I don't like deep fried food. Even the grilled squid was not delicious. I typically love squid, octopus, calamari, but this was not good. The redeeming factor was the avocado slices layering the shell. And, pls do read carefully: they slice an entire jalapennio into this tostada!

The service was good and efficient and no complaints. The front dinning room seats at least 20 people. Plus there is bar seating. The bar is a mesmerazing tequila shelving unit.

I am glad to have finally experienced it, even if I found it disappointing."}
{"text":"Tacos were cheap, which were awesome. Quite small so you pay for the size but yet very fancy! Loud music, great for a young matured group of people. Had a great time at this place :)"}
{"text":"If you have read the other reviews then you know the place is LOUD!!@ Honestly not sure what the the point of the music is... its not mexican related, not even great music and just plain loud....Could barely keep a conversation going without telling people to repeat themselves every sentence.

We found the service quite good and waitresses were quite nice. Not sure whom the negative reviews on waitresses were referring to.

Lived in San Diego and definitely had my fair share of cross the border mexican joints over there. This place has decent tacos which our group enjoyed.

- Had the baja fish, beef cheek, scrapple and the cauliflower. All decent but I found a bit small.
- The \"extras\" which were share-able dishes were actually a little better IMO
- We all enjoyed the Chorizo & Brussels, Tuna Ceviche and spicy squid.
- I think the squid is too spicy, killing all the flavour and my favorite is the Chorizo a& Brussles surprisingly. Well balanced texture and flavour from the Chorizo at the bottom and the crispy and light Brussels on top.

We also tried the Electric Dirt and Key Lime as they didn't have the Churros. The desserts were meh. Nothing special. I would skip out and yelp a nearby dessert place.

I would not recommend this place if you intend to try to have a conversation or discussion. Hope the owner does read all the reviews and turns down the damn music. Really takes away from people wanting to stay longer (Maybe that is their strategy as the lines can get long)

Probably deserves a 4 for mexican places in Toronto but since the busy was just annoying and its not really comparable to most 4 start mexican joints in California I'll leave it at a 3."}
{"text":"On a 5th try, I actually made it inside Grand Electric, kudos to my determination and to the acids of my stomach for not dissolving me from the inside while waiting in line.
I don't know whether I am just that unlucky but previous 4 times I have been given wait time estimates of 1 to 1.5 hours, couple of times I actually waited for the required time but wasn't admitted because the line was moving slower stretching hour and a half wait well into 2 hours, a ridiculous amount of time to be waiting for anything or anyone in my world, hence 1 to 1.5 stars off, and maybe on occasion stretching to 2 stars off.

Question of the day: was it worth it? Definitely not. I'll explain why.

Once inside we've ordered the entire menu of tacos, guaco, salad of the day and some draughts. Guaco was nice and came with petite portion of spicy tomato salsa, it had good chunks of avocado and quite interesting sprinkling of julienned radishes on top. It was rather a small portion for $8, but a nice compliment to the rest of the meal.
Tacos: the only one worth mentioning out of 6 we ordered was the beef cheek taco, heavily spiced and topped with some fresh pepper providing a proper backdrop for the meat. One person can easily down 3 of these, although they must be followed by something alcoholic or consequences can be dramatic.
Salad: nothing special, just yogurt topped with  Bibb lettuce and a mix of scallions, turnips and nuts, it sounded better than it tasted.

All in all not a bad meal, maybe somewhere between \"A-OK\" and \"I'm a fan\", but most certainly it is not worth a 2 hour wait, no matter how you look at it. Next time I am in the area I will not be taking chances on not so grand Grand Electric and will head straight to it's sister bar Electric Mud, but that's a different review altogether."}
{"text":"I was job shadowing in Parkdale when I came across Grand Electric. Having heard many favourable reviews, I decided to pop in for lunch. The bar had a very relaxed vibe. There was loud hip hop music playing and the staff were in casual clothes. The space wasn't very big but luckily I came at a less busy time because apparently the wait time to be seated takes forever during certain hours.

There were no hand-out menus and their entire menu was on a chalkboard. Therefore, the choices were pretty limited. When I saw that the tacos were $3.60 each, I cringed a little. I hummed and hawed for a bit before deciding on one Baja Fish taco and one Belly Pork taco.

When I received the tacos, I understood immediately why people warned me about how pricey Grand Electric was. The size of the tacos were so small! Someone who enjoyed having more substance in her meal, I wasn't too please with the portions. There was no way I was going to order another round to get a satisfying lunch because I knew it was going to cost me a hefty penny.

I definitely love the Baja Fish taco. It was extremely tasty and unique. The pork belly was also good, but being Asian and having to eat a lot of pork belly already, it was nothing new. If you come to Grand Electric, you would definitely appreciate the gourmet tacos."}
{"text":"Definitely lived up to the hype! We ordered every taco they had to try and liked all of them! The baha fish was our favourite, but all the others were good as well.  We got lucky with seating (arrived at 5:30ish on a Thursday) and got a table right away, food was brought fairly quick too.  Didn't get a chance to try any of the desserts.  Personally i enjoy hip-hop and rap music, so i loved the atmosphere, but if you don't like loud music pointed at your head you may want to hesitate going here.  Overall a really good experience."}
{"text":"The food was not good. The pork rinds were so tasteless and hard. They're supposed to be crunchy but when I got them, it was too hard to eat and flavourless. It made my teeth hurt chewing on them. The spicy chicken was bland and cold. I don't plan on coming back to eat here ever again."}
{"text":"Decided to go to Grand Electric on a Thursday night around 6:30. The estimated wait was 60-90 minutes. I was a bit shocked, but considering the size and popularity of the location, it makes sense. It gave us some time to drive down Queen and see a few sites.
Started with some guacamole and chips- quite good, but maybe a little steep at $8. 
Decided to get a Cerveza Monkey (great!) and 8 taco's between the two of us. Doubled up on 'Beef Shoulder' and 'Pork Tinga', then tried one each of 'Baja Fish', 'Spicy Chicken', 'Corn Surpreme' and 'Scrapple.'
Beef shoulder was BY FAR the best taco on the menu, followed by the baja fish. I was quite dissapointed with the corn surpreme.  I'm not sure what type of corn was used for the filling, but it had a strange mouth-feel and didn't taste of very good quality. 
Ended the meal with a small key lime pie, which was just the right size. 
Service was exceptional! We were well looked after, and treated to a second chicarone (after I dropped my first on the floor....)

Only negative comment? TURN THE MUSIC DOWN!!! As someone who has mild hearing loss, I had an incredibly tough time even hearing my date, and suffered with muffled hearing the rest of the night. I understand having a great atmosphere, but this made it nearly intolerable. I would love to bring my father, but there is no way he'd be able to cope with the noise. 

All in all, I'd return. Guac & chips, 8 tacos, one pint, one key lime pie. $54. Not a bad little dinner!"}
{"text":"My dreams of finding a baja fish tacos that can match my experience in Chicago and San Diego continues and the next stop was Grand Electric.  This place has interested in me in a long time as I often see it on many Toronto best Taco list.   Most of the time it also is on 'packed in like a sardine' list as well.  On a Sunday afternoon, this was half filled and the breeze was coming in nicely since they opened up the front windows.  

This place is not very large... maybe 10 tables that can fit 2 to 4 and a few more at the bar.  We had our pick of tables since it was mostly empty.  Unlike what I've read, the atmosphere on a Sunday afternoon is super relaxed.  Our tables weren't bumped up against another and it was very clean.  We probably we were the first ones sitting at the table that day.

The waitress was super pleasant and quickly filled our water glasses and took our order quickly.  We decided on the same or similar type of tacos we ordered at 7 lives and El Local Loco to compare how it holds up.  We got the baja fish, crispy cauliflower, pork carnitas, and spicy chicken.  Overall, comparing it to the other 2 Toronto places we've tried, you could debate that it is better than El Local Loco but I think 7 Lives still squeak past Grand Electric to hold the title of best taco in Toronto.  I didn't have much tummy space after indulging at Tempered Room so I only ate 2 of the selections.

Baja Fish - My favourite taco!  Grand Electric did an pretty good job on this one.  The batter was crispy and seasoned.  The fish wasn't overcooked or dried out.  The toppings of mayo, salsa, cabbage, cilantro and raddish was good as it added a crunch and creaminess.  I found though it had maybe too much mayo as it was mostly just creamy with very little tanginess or heat to really up the flavour of it.  Solid taco but just didnt have the same wow factor as ones I've had at 7 Lives.  4/5

Crispy Cauliflower - This is an excellent vegetarian taco.  Crispy tempura'd cauliflower is covered in pickled serrano, mole sauce, and green onions.  The texture is very good... the batter is light and not oily while the cauliflower is tender inside.  The pickled serrano is perfect as it adds a touch of good heat while giving it an acidic kick that's needed.  The only drawback was that the green onions was a bit heavy handed and sometimes I only got a mouthful of green onion.  Overall, still very good and I'd order this again 4/5

Service here was quick (less than 10 minutes to get our food) and very fast.  We were in and out of here in under 40 minutes.  Definitely a good place to grab a bite on Sunday if you're looking for some good tacos."}
{"text":"Haha, I reviewed Electric Mud and not Grand Electric!

Now I've been here twice and let me tell you: best tacos ever! 

The first time we went on a very busy weekend night and had to wait over at Electric Mud. The wait was about 25 minutes for a table for two, not terrible. I really like their hostess system and the fact that you receive a text and not a phone call. I don't remember much from that night (WASTED!) but I do remember being so happy to get tacos in my mouth that I bit my tongue quite badly. It didn't stop me from eating though. That night they had pig's ears tacos that were so delicious!

I just got some takeout from there and ordered what I remembered as being very good: scrapple, baja fish x 2 and beef cheek. I really, really love the scrapple. The baja fish is one of the best fish tacos in Toronto. While the beef cheek is okay, a little too heavy on jalapenos and sauce and the meat is on the dry side.

I really want to give this place 5 stars but I dislike the intentionally created atmosphere. The servers are aloof, a bit too cool to actually be servers. The hostess, however, was very friendly and helpful. I think the servers can be cool and helpful...if they tried. I also don't like  the extremely loud hip hop that's played no matter the day or time. I feel like an old person yelling \"get off my lawn\" but it seriously deters me from bringing friends here and showing them the amazing tacos! 

Also what's up with not being able to take-out whatever I want to?"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend of mine on a quiet Saturday afternoon around 1:30 pm. It was a good decision because we got a table right away and the music wasn't too loud. It gets pretty loud in the evenings from what I recall.

We ordered two of baja fish, beef cheek, carnitas, spicy chicken, and crispy cauliflower tacos, and a quesadilla on the side. The waitress looked at us and said, \"Um yeah... so that's a lot of food.\" We laughed and said, \"Don't worry, if we can't finish we'll just take the rest home.\"

The tacos started coming out quite fast. Round 1 was beef cheek, carnitas, and spicy chicken. My favorite in round 1 was the carnitas. Perfectly cooked and well balanced toppings. Second favorite was the beef cheek. Lastly, the spicy chicken was good too but it was a bit intense in terms of the heat level. Not overwhelming but almost a bit too much. I probably won't order the spicy chicken taco next time.

Round 2 was baja fish and crispy cauliflower. Oh man. Both were excellent. My favorite was baja fish but crispy cauliflower finished in a close second. 

Then came the quesadilla. And lo and behold, we were too full to eat it. So we packed it to take it home. 

Overall, if I were to go back I'd order the carnitas, baja fish, and crispy cauliflower tacos for sure. I might order the beef cheek tacos if I'm still hungry but those three are the best. 

I love their menu because it's small and simple. The service and ambiance were great too. All in all, a nice place to grab some decent tacos if you're in the downtown area."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. I've been a fan since they opened and their consistency with their food and service is what keeps me coming back here. 

- Their fish tacos are the best in the city. I've tried too many kinds of fish tacos in Toronto and nowhere else compares. 
- The Guac and Chips are Godly. All fresh and the Guac is to die for.
- The Tuna Ceviche is generous in portion and on top of a crispy flat tortilla. It's not meant to be eaten by being picked up. You use a fork! Delicious.
-The beef cheek taco is also one of my favourites. At first I was hesitant but now its a must every time I go.
- Also love how its a whiskey bar and blast great old school rap and hip hop. 

 I'm not sure about how long the wait time is anymore but its definitely worth it. Just hit up a bar down the street and wait for them to call you. I feel like they should expand or renovate to accommodate more people but other than that I can't complain about a thing."}
{"text":"If you're in Toronto, and you're cool, you are HERE. My GOD these were the best tacos I have ever had in my life...and I live in LA. Shit, son. 
The waitresses are smoking hot, and the liquor washes down the spicy tacos. Yummo, yummo, yummo."}
{"text":"Despite me just naming 7 Lives the overall best taco --- Grand Electric is no slouch whatsoever.  The taste rivals 7 for sure.  But what you'll find here is a WAAAAAY better atmosphere.  Actual tables.  Liquor license.  Hot and friendly (yet hipster I'm a bit too cool for you) staff.  

I highly recommend the spicy octopus on top of trying every one of their tacos.

ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"Good food
Fairly priced
Service is not the friendliest
Long wait times to get a table and no reservation but the food and charming space is worth it."}
{"text":"A cute little low key spot. I only came in for a few drinks but was satisfied with the service!"}
{"text":"Terrible music, terrible service but amazing food.  The best tacos in Toronto!  I keep coming back here because I can't find a better taco in town.  And the prices are very good.  Best to come early in the evening, especially Thurs-Sun."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: The price is right and them tacos (and everything else) are tight!

It's no surprise that the owners who brought you the Black Hoof and Hoof Cafe (R.I.P.) have another winner on their hands. The  best part is the unbelievable prices they're able to move their product at!

They offer what I would describe as the Black Hoof meets Mexicana - I'm not sure how authentic it is, but the flavours are rich and the food is hearty. The tacos are of the silver dollar variety that come in multiples of 3s with 4 flavours to choose from: fish, beef cheek, spicy chicken and pork belly. If I had to rank them, it would be in this same order; I was surprised (and disappointed) how flavourless the pork belly was! The guacamole was exceedingly fresh. But the highlight for me was the tripe soup, though amongst my dinner mates, I'm sure I was the only one (as long as you don't think too hard where it comes from, you'll be fine!). 

We didn't embark on the bourbon binge (for shame, I know), but their list seems extensive even though I think you could get most of them from the Summerhill LCBO. Instead, we chased our food with a bottle of Unibroue's Limited Edition Grand Reserve 17 (delicious!) and their cocktails (I believe it was aptly named the Grand Electric). They also have one of my favourite beers on tap: Dieu du Ciel's Peche Mortel - son, this beer is liquid butter...(drool)!

Finally, the beats are good and not *that* loud as others have commented (maybe they dialed it back some), but the space is cramped, which is too bad given how spectacular this could be with more seating and less waiting."}
{"text":"Is Grand Electric a taco shack or a bourbon bar?  As much as they're known for their tacos, they have an amazing bourbon menu. A chalkboard of bourbon choices extends from the ceiling to the floor. We had shots of the McAfee's Benchmark Bourbon, which is a low to mid range bourbon. It had a strong spicy nose with a cinnamony sweet note and finished off with a mild burn. My friend had their margarita and claimed it was one of the best she had ever had. That's high praise considering she has had her fair share. 
 
For food, I had the Baja Fish, Beef Cheek and Chicken tacos. The fish was light and crispy. Beef cheek was rich and tender. The chicken was spicy and a bit tangy. What made the tacos really good was the little touches like the pickled radish, freshly chopped cilantro and assortment of condiments such as the tangy and spicy salsa verde. The tacos are bite sized and I was surprised to be full after only three. We also shared their chips and guacamole. 

As for the ambience, I was lucky to walk in around lunch time. The lunch time rush is about the biggest crowd I would be able to handle. I don't understand why people come to this place at night. You line up out the door only to get packed inside like sardines. I also found their super loud music kind of irritating."}
{"text":"This place makes me so angry! While their food was ok, I will never step foot in there again. Food made me sick, but that's not even the reason. Here's why: We ordered, and the tacos came out too spicy for the wife. Not a big deal, right? We can just ask for no salsa or salsa on the side. NOPE. The \"chef\" does not allow for such a modification. No onions? No cheese? No cilantro? No problem! No salsa? The manager literally said she would rather see us not eat than remove salsa from the tacos. That was it, we were out. I understand not changing salsa for guacamole or something (well not really, but I wouldn't complain about that), but not allowing you to simply remove the one ingredient that is making the food unenjoyable? This place is ridiculous."}
{"text":"[Good]
Tacos - Had the Baja Fish taco and the Spicy Chicken taco.  Flavours were good, the fish was lightly battered and both tacos were saucy and served on soft shells.

[Bad]
Slow - Did take out and ordered only 4 tacos.  The restaurant didn't look that busy as it was after 2pm.  It still took 30 minutes for the order to be ready.

[Worth it?]
Not really, despite the quality.  It's $5 per taco and each taco is so small it's literally 2 bites.  If you're looking for value, this is not the place to go.  If you're looking for quality and don't mind the price, this place is worth a try."}
{"text":"We've been waiting to come here for a long while and it was worth the wait. Although shy of 5 stars, the vibe was ultra cool. It's a Mexicanny hipster taco shackish bar. Perfect for 20's and 30's.

Food was 3.5 stars. The tacos at Seven Lives are definitely better - sorry! We had the baja fish and horse cheek tacos. The flavours just didn't jam, but the menu was unique and enticing.

The drinks were nice and cold and we sat at the bar. Service was quick. We did wait for about 30-40 mins for a seat though.

Pro tip: Come here first, get your name on the list. Then head next door or across the street for a drink while you wait. Come back 10-15 earlier than quoted and see if they have a seat ready. It worked for us!

Go for the vibe, maybe not the food. Overall experience 4 stars, a must try."}
{"text":"I love grand electric. I hate their lines and waiting. But i love them so much that i would wait in those lines (and have waited) for hours and hours. 

The convenient thign is that theyre so close to bars... if your patient (and good things come to those who wait) you can grab a drink somewhere then get the text that your table is ready and have some of the most amazing food in this city.

Im biased. I LOVE the spicy squid. I could eat that every week (if i could only get to parkdale every week). Its hot and spicy and delicious and crunchy and the toppings are amazing. they also have a variation of it with octopus which i love as well.

my favorite tacos are the Baja Fish and the Scrapple. But everythign is genuinly veyr tasty. I just always go back to ordering more and more of those.

I also thank this restaurant for introducing me and my husband to Bourbon. Hes become quite the little bourbon connosoiur and i love headign here to tyr new ones on their list. 

Price wise - its cheap and cheerful and OH if you have space...their lemon merengue pie was also a perfect way to end off a meal here. :) Will continue to come back over and over again."}
{"text":"My taco tour of Toronto is incomplete, but the first two places recommended to me were a pretty big disappointment: Tacos El Asador & El Trompo.  I'm a new-school, white-boy taco aficionado, which tips my hat to the tiny, two-bite, long stewed, flavour rich tacos I grew to love at places like Loteria (LA) and Barrio Chino (NYC).  

I'm not a fan of the aforementioned's oversized, over-lettuced, chewy-meat offerings heaped in pico de gallo atop tasteless tortillas.  What Grand Electric offers is of the former, 'hipster' variety (\"honestly, I'm not a hipster\" - the lament of every hipster)...but don't let that deter you: these are easily the best tacos I've had in Toronto.  

My only gripe with GE is the make-your-ears-bleed cheap speakers blasting (mostly) golden age hip-hop.  Note to management: turn down the suck by investing in some decent speakers.  Note #2: keep cranking out the beef cheek."}
{"text":"This is currently my favourite restaurant in the city and my reasons are quite simple:

1) the atmosphere is super chill... but still sort of dark and sexy.
2) the price points are reasonable. Since everything is priced by the individual unit, you can afford to have lots of variety without breaking the bank. Usually when I go my bf and I order one of each of their tacos (about 6 each) + one cocktail each and end up spending about $70 total. You get stuffed without felling gross.
3) the food is simple but amazing. My fav is the chicken which has a spicy kick, as well as the baja fish. Generally I like all the tacos I have tried but the corn was my least favourite.

Warning: This place gets packed fast but in my experience after 10:30pm on weekdays there is never a wait which is good because I am a late eater!

Also I wish their cocktails had more options for those of us not in love with bourbon and whisky... that being said if you like your hard liquor you'll love the Bourbon-aid and Electric Sour.

Debit & Cash only"}
{"text":"So many people love this place- personally, I don't get it. We ordered the guacamole and I have to say it was really bland with no complex flavours at all. It's missing a lot of kick that for example, some more onions might provide. I honestly believe I can make a better guac. The tacos I ordered were also not that great either. Ordered the chorizo as well as the fish. They weren't terrible, as I don't think you can really mess up tacos- but again, definitely not something to write home about. Again, I think it was just too bland and not enough flavour. I associate Mexican food with complex flavours and this didn't give me any of that.

On the other hand, the ambience is good. Really small- but cozy. However, if I'm out having tacos, I want more than just an atmosphere. Will not be returning for my next taco craving."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's loud, it's fun and the food is so good. Nice staff that are on their game. I live in the area so I've been many times, and it almost always delivers.

{"text":"Until Seven Lives opened, this was the best taco joint in the city.

Grand Electric has led the charge in the Toronto trend of offering delicious food in the most uncomfortable environment imaginable.  I'd guess it's all about turnover, with wait times often approaching an hour or more.  The seats suck.  The layout's awkward, forcing you to struggle past other diners.  In the winter the freezing cold will blow through the entire place every time the door's opened.  The music's too loud and the staff makes no secret of the fact that they do not like you.  Don't take it personally; they hate everyone equally, and everyone gets their fair share of indifference from the majority of the servers.

The Baja Fish is proficiently fried, second only to Seven Lives'.  Forget La Carnita and Playa Cabana: only two restaurants do Baja Fish tacos properly in Toronto, and Grand Electric's one of them.  Cabbage, crema, bit of radish, dash of salsa - done.  Beer-battered and fried, not tempura battered.  This is not complicated, at least not to Grand Electric.

The Pork Tinga's flavorful, albeit a bit too stewed in texture.  The Arbol Chicken's got a nice bite to it.  The Fried Queso and Poblano is a pleasant, light respite from the meatier options.  The beef cheek is rich and moist, framed perfectly with a bit of onion, jalapeno, and thinly sliced avocado that draws everything together.  It's a huge standout and a must-try.  The scrapple's a greasy indulgence, the kind of thing you'll feel guilty for eating.  It's stellar junk food.  They've got a great selection of bourbon, and some of the best guacamole going.

Virtually everything here is worth eating, though most of the tacos are pretty one-note.  It's great, but it's not amazing, lacking the depth of Seven Lives' fare.  That said, it's well worth trying if you're a taco fan... Even if the service sucks, you have to wait an hour, and you freeze half to death in your ridiculously uncomfortable seat."}
{"text":"It has been more than a couple months until I was able to get to try grand electric and my review is positive.

Four bourbon shots, three taquitos, and two churros were all delicous. I prefered the pigtail, or beef cheek. Good trendy setting, yet all I could see was my date & the calm chefs in the kitchen. I would return for some taquitos and a quick drink after I check out the other trending Toronto establishments.


 $80 w/tax+tip."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night at 6 on the dot. Small, dark and dingy restaurant with a super hipster vibe. The staff were really nice and attentive and the food. AMAZING. I would probably come here every day if it weren't in Parkdale. So far away from everything. Oh well. Tried the beef tacos which were ehhh, comparable to Mucho Burrito tacos- nothing to write home about. The specials of the week (?) = amazing... mackarel with some sort of raison puree sauce... out of this world amazing. No amount of words can describe how delicious it was, you'll just have to try it yourself. The seared beef tartare was also really delicious and memorable. So much flavor. For dessert I had the coconut cream... should've taken it to go because it was pretty rich! -1 star because within 5 minutes of paying for the bill, we were asked to leave immediately. There was no line or other patrons waiting to be seated... Where's the fire?"}
{"text":"Small resto with loud hip hop! Although it's a great atmosphere, the wait is usually long for a table but luckily you can give them your # and they will text when a table is free. 

I tried the beef cheek taco which was very tasty. Soft shredded beef with excellent flavour. I really liked the baja fish taco as well, really well done. The tuna ceviche was subpar I've had better and the guac was really good but what a small portion with so many chips. More guac, less chips, hellllllo!!!!

I had the coconut cream pie in a jar for dessert which was actually amazing!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to have some tacos at Grand Electric...but I guess I am spoiled... I don't really want to line up and my friends who are nice enough to line up for me and I just show up right before the place opens... I have to say THANK YOU!!

I guess after lining up for 45 min and being the first in line... they were hungry.... And as usual...someone dear wants everything interesting on the menu...

Miami Ribs ($13)
- really tender and well flavoured... remind me of Korean style ribs
- love the fat on the ribs
- fingers licking good... (we ate with our fingers...)

Baja Fish Taco/Spicy Arbol Chicken Taco/Beef Cheek Taco @$3.50 each
- I love the Baja fish that best.. the batter is light and the fish fresh
- Chicken a little on the dry side... 
- Beef Cheek has really rich and has a complex flavour

Spicy Squid ($9)
- definitely remind me of Korean style 
- hot sauce mixed in with a sour note
- squid are tender but I think I might pass on this next time

Guacamole & Chips ($10)
- the chips are freshly baked... eat them right away if not they lost their crunchiness
- Not much flavour in the dish itself... I can even say a little bland... 
- Would not offer that next time!

And I washed them down with Cerveza Monkey ($6)

For dessert:
Key Lime Vaso ($5) and Chocolate & Pecans ($5)
- I like Key Lime Vaso a little better since it has smooth and sour and sweet at the same time... 
- Chocolate Pudding is a little boring.... just too sweet for me

Churros ($6)
- I always love Churros... especially freshly made and filled with Dolce de Leche (life is sweet!!)

Music is a little loud... an excuse for me to scream at my friends.. ignore them...or get close to them ... whatever I like...

Services is friendly, efficient and personal...........

What a great evening!! I am ready to come back to Grand Electric again... Text me whenever?!!!"}
{"text":"The line up is long, even on a Tuesday night, the portions are small, and the service is indifferent at best and surly at worst.So why the 4 stars? The food is just really good.

Grand Electric started the taco trend in Toronto several years ago and they're still going strong. Still the best in Toronto (possible exception seven lives). On a recent visit, the standouts were the beef cheek, shrimp, and cauliflower. For dessert, the key lime pie was great.

I don't have the patience to come very often but the food makes it worth it."}
{"text":"Patio is awesome. Tacos are great we liked the fish and pork belly best. The chicken was wicked spicy. Chips and guac are tasty fresh chips and guac tasted super creamy."}
{"text":"A friend of mind brought me here one night but really, this place is seems hidden in a secret garden. As we were finding a place to park, we drove by Grand Electric for a couple times but we still could not see the signs of the restaurant from outside.

We came here in a Friday night and it was packed! There are a number of people waiting a head of you before you are seated (it's that good!). This is a small local restaurant with authentic home made tacos. You must try the baja fish tacos!!

Definitely a return."}
{"text":"After coming back from Mexico we were craving some bites and this place hit the spot!  Small menu with great options.  Had the chilechiles without chorizo, refried beans with freshly crisped tortillas, chicharrone with lime and seasoned salt, and a selection of tacos (pork tinga, pork belly that was like pastor with pineapple and spicy chicken).  Inexpensive for the most part..tiny space, great vibe"}
{"text":"This place is never a let down. Absolutely fantastic tacos.  Great cocktails. The only thing that sucks is the wait. But it's worth it."}
{"text":"I'm off the Grand Electric train. 

Last time I was here, while good, there was no wow-factor in anything I ate. In fact, I found everything too sauce-laden and soggy. The beef cheek was good, but again, lost points to too much .... *everything*.... on it. 

My girlfriend loved it, and she's been a few times, but if she asked me to go again I'd probably force/recommend Electric Mud. 

The desserts are brilliant. I could eat two of the coconut creams. Scratch that. Three. Easy. Luckily I can get those at Mud too."}
{"text":"Grand Electric is a tiny space, woody and dark. Though it's packed with seats, we were still told to wait at least an hour. Stomachs rumbling but determined to dine here, me and my man-date (Paul H!) decided to wait it out. Parkdale is still vibrant in the evenings and we killed some time at Community 54 and River Trading Co. About 45 minutes later we got the call and headed back. 

There was room at the bar, so we sidled up. It's a tight squeeze for sure, but it gave us a better few of the action, and we got to chat a bit with the bartenders. As others have mentioned here the music is loud and skews toward hip-hop and rap. At one point the tunes gave way for an interlude of gun-shots. Like twenty-five seconds worth. Comical indeed, but I guess the lesson here is: bring someone you don't mind shouting at, i.e., date number four, not number one.

The have a short draft menu, and a long list of dark spirits particularly bourbon. Their specialty is a bourbon sour with vanilla infused Wild Turkey and it looked like they tossed an egg white in there too. The result is a very sweet sour (if that makes any sense) served in a tall glass. It went down smooth. 

We ordered a plate of chips and fresh guacamole ($8), the spicy squid ($9), and three tacos each ($10). I opted for the fish, pork belly taco and beef cheeks. The guac was super fresh and lime-y and you could find ample chunks of avocado that had been spared by the pestle. It was served with a playing-card-sized pork rind sticking straight up in the guac. Great. The spicy squid was crispy rings of squid in a tangy red sauce. Not very spicy but a great snack. The tacos were on the small side but each was quite delicious. I would recommend the fish taco, and the pork belly. The beef cheek tasted almost sweet, so I found myself killing with it with spicy salsa.

Sharing the two apps and three tacos apiece seemed to be JUST enough for the two grown man-boys dining that night. The vibe here is great if you don't mind the wait. 

Obligatory Title Pun: Grand Electric is irRESISTible.

Menu Readability: In cursive on monstrous (and obviously custom-sized) chalkboard throughout.

Need to mention: Push that door to get in.

What this place teaches me about myself: I'll wait for tacos. I'll wait forever."}
{"text":"I have stayed away from Grand Electric in the past, assuming based on friend's reports that it offered very little available in the way of vegetarian options. Today I was pleasantly surprised to find that was a false rumour. 

I should also note I have a nightshade aversion. So vegetarian staples like eggplant, zucchini, and avocado are also off the table for me unless I want to fold over in stomach-cramping pain. So, no meat plus no avocado makes Lauren a sad girl at a Mexican eatery. Usually.

But, there are a number of veg friendly, non-avocado delights to eat here. I wasn't starving so only had two tacos: the crispy cauliflower and the spicy yam. Both were delicious and were washed down by a refreshing Paloma as I sat on the sunny back patio."}
{"text":"Amazing from start to finish!
We sat on the back patio, which has a great atmosphere, on a weekday for an early dinner. The patio is all communal tables which adds to the casual and social feel. All of the front of house staff were charming and welcoming. They were attentive and friendly without being obtrusive or fake. 
I had the jesus juice cocktail, which was tasty and refreshing and had just the right amount of sweetness for a very hot summer day. We had a bunch of the tacos, and all were perfect. A big standout for me was their shrimp taco. The shrimp inside was breaded and fried, which made me nervous that it would only taste like batter and oil. I was so wrong. It had a wonderful shrimp flavor that was perfectly complemented by the sauce. The beef cheek was also a highlight. 
Although there are lots of places to get cheaper tacos in the city, I will definitely be back to Grand Electric. The patio, service, cocktails, and variety of delicious taco options make it absolutely worth it. Would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better.\" Thats a good description of my experience. I was recommended to come here from three Torontonians, so perhaps I built up an expectation for great tacos.

Positive comments: I really enjoyed the chips and dip.  I do appreciate the selection of tacos offered.  I like the vibe of the place. 

Negative comments: I had four different tacos. They were okay enough to eat. I didn't think they were particularly great.The cleanliness of the business lacked. The menu's were dirty, the bottom of our water jug was dirty, the bin for our chips were dirty (perhaps that was oil from the chips - but does not explain the hard green stuff on the bin). My waitress was not pleasant. I felt like I was inconveniencing her. Its a bummer that the service is what gave me a total turn off. The drink was not good. Overall value of money to quality was not balanced."}
{"text":"There is really only one prerequisite to you loving this place - you have to have taste buds.  That's all.  Actually scratch that, I don't even think you'll need taste buds, just a taste bud, only one working taste bud.  Now let's be clear, we are talking tacos here.  Nothing crazy, just tacos.  But the kind of taco one might start a fight for.  The kind of taco that makes you want to propose... to the taco.  Get the crispy cauliflower, fish, and pork belly.  Three points on the taco compass.  Eat them out back, at one of the communal tables.  Drink at least one margarita per taco.  Marvel at what a good time it is to be alive."}
{"text":"Small, cozy restaurant with a great ambiance. The chips and 3 dip platter was great! I tried the spicy chicken, baja fish and shrimp. I found the baja fish to be lacking in flavour but the spicy chicken and shrimp were great! They have great lunchtime deals and the tacos were reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Nice little hole in the wall for Mexican food. The quality of the food is beyond excellent however the amount of cilantro used is too much in some of their foods and literally everything has onions in it except for one taco and the desserts. The diversity in the ingredients in each taco is something to be desired because of the large amounts of cilantro and onions. The key lime pie however was beyond amazing. It's worth going just for that."}
{"text":"Brought to you by the owner's of Black Hoof, I knew this place was going to be hipster central and packed to the gills...and i was right!
Thank god i had to have an early dinner and ended up there right after 6pm (they open at 6 - no reservations), my friend had already scored a table in this tiny restaurant (seating for maybe 30 max??) and i thankfully sat down right away, but not after hearing the hostess tell the unlucky walk ins (after me) that there was a 90 min wait!
For such a busy place the service was really prompt and efficient and we had our order taken right away.  The server brought us chips and guac (don't assume these are free - $8) but they were yummy.  Chips were super crispy and the guac was nice and fresh with lots of lime.  There was a little side of salsa as well.
My friends tried the Grand Electric Sour (their only cocktail on the menu, they specialize in bourbon and have some beer as well - all written on a chalkboard) and they gave it average reviews, said it tasted sweet and someone the word egg nog was dropped).  
Tacos are the star on the menu so that's what we got - at $3.50 each you could afford to try a bunch of them.
Baja Fish - breaded and fried white fish, really fresh and tender, piled high with zingy and crispy cabbage - yum!
Spicy Chicken - chunks of chicken in a...you guessed it, spicy sauce...nice kick to it.
Beef cheek - upon this small little corn tortilla was a pretty massive pile of tender, slightly sweet, a little bit spicy, finger tender (no forks were given) beef.

All in all i thought all of these were amazingly tasty and fresh, the price was crazy affordable and i'd definitely come back to try the rest of the sides/soups/pork belly taco that they have on the menu.  
A great new Parkdale addition.

Note:  they are closed on Tuesdays, no split bills, and only accept cash or debit"}
{"text":"The food is delicious especially their baja fish tacos and the atmosphere is very cozy.  I would think twice if you are bringing someone on a date because you won't be able to talk louder than their beaming music.  Gave a 3-star rating due to how the servers constantly rush for you to leave right after ordering and bring your receipt to your table when you are not even finished."}
{"text":"The management here was awful - bad vibes!

We arrived just before 6pm on Thurs and was told that the wait would be about half an hour.  Several people got seated before us and when we asked about it - were told that they had reservations which we were just told were not allowed.  We were not allowed to sit at the bar because they were also \"reserved\".  These seats remained empty for over an hour.  We saw a \"reserved\" table empty for also over an hour while we were standing there.  By the way - the half hour estimate, and I understand it was just an estimate - turned into an hour and a half wait with people coming in after us without \"reservations\" getting seated.  The food was decent but not worth the effort to get a seat. Seriously, go somewhere else where they respect you as a customer."}
{"text":"I love tacos and I was excited to try this due to a high numbers of positive reviews. However I was disappointed. Tacos were very average; nothing to rave about. They are from $3-$4.45 each, depends on what kinds of tacos you get. I tried chicken, beef cheeks and fish tacos. Chicken and fish were ok. Beef cheek was disappointed, didn't like the sweetness flavour.
Tacos are very very small. I needed 3 tacos and one wing order

Mexi wings are good; $9.5 per order and came with 3 big wings. I also tried Mission wings which were quite gross. I did not like them at all. We had to leave some unfinished wings as flavours were just awful. 

Place is very small. Not ideal for groups. And they don't take resevasion. IMO it's not worth the hype and the long wait."}
{"text":"I've been fortunate, each time I've been to Grand Electric I've never had to endure the notoriously long wait times. I normally stick to 3-4 of the tacos and a drink. They are all quite good and I appreciate that each one has its own unique toppings and sauces. The music is absolutely booming so having a conversation can be very difficult. I really like Grand Electric though, if given the choice, I think I'm visiting its younger brother Electric Mud."}
{"text":"***LUNCH***

I haven't been back to Grand Electric (@grandelectricTO) since my post here due to their famous 2hrs lineup. They over seven days a week for lunch, so we decided to give it a try for lunch one Saturday since we passed by a couple of times not seeing lineups..... and lucky us, we only waited for 20-30mins, just enough time to grab a coffee across the street (^_^)

 Simple menu on the board just like dinner.
They have the same taco choices and a lot of the other dishes for both lunch & dinner, so I would suggest coming for lunch to avoid the long wait and still enjoy their yummy goodness.

Spicy Caesar $10 & Ceviche Monkey Beer $6.50

Pork Belly Torta $9
~ I am so glad that it came with the wet-naps since it was very saucy and was quite messy but incredibly delicious. 
~ The pork belly was just melt in your mouth good with the thick spicy sweet sauce and also love the bun which soak up the sauce nicely inside but without soaking through the crust. (had the taco version last time here and it was my fave taco of the night)

 Pozole $7 
~ add an egg $0.50
~Just as my last visit I love their hearty soup with the incredible spicy salsa on the side, not to mention the huge pile of Guacamole on top and the egg on top. 
~ It's just so pack with flavor served piping hot which is perfect for cold or gloomy weather.

We order 4 tacos to share at $3.5/ea
Baja Fish, Pork Tinga, Spicy Arbol Chicken and Scrapple Taco
~ Love how much filling there is here and they are only at $3.50 each plus they are all so delicious.
~ I actually never had Scrapple before and I actually love it with the soft and mushy texture with the fried crispy shell plus the aioli and soft taco.

Key Lime $5
~ Love dessert in a jar (ask my friends, I have a strange addiction with bottles & jars) and it taste as good as I remember.

Verdict :
~ We will definitely come back to lunch now that we know the wait is so much better than dinner
~ Love everything here just as much as my first visit"}
{"text":"Love this little hipster joint! Affordable tacos and bourbon...who wouldn't fall in love with this place?! Tacos may seem like a snack but they're surprisingly filling! I've never had a problem getting a seat at this place. The atmosphere is chill and it just feels comfortable. Very Parkdale-esque! If you're looking for a quick, dirty (a good dirty) meal...go here."}
{"text":"There had been so much hype about Grand Electric that I was surprised it took me so long to check this place out. Finally, for a double birthday celebration, my friends and I ventured to Parkdale to finally taste some much lauded tacos!

Between the 7 of us, we were able to order everything on the menu, except for the ensalada electrico (because none of us were too interested in a salad that day). We each ordered our choice of tacos and shared everything else. 

One of my friends ordered a Grand Electric Sour, which was recommended by our waitress. I took a sip and thought it was disgusting at first. However, after a few more sips, the drink grew on me.

Now onto the food!!

Guacamole and chips ($8)-this was fabulous, and probably one of my favourite items in the evening! The chips were super fresh, and the chicharrón in the middle of the guacamole was incredibly light yet crunchy at the same time. It was an immediate hit at the table.

Chipotle shrimp ($8.50)- probably my least favourite dish of the night due to personal preferences. I'm not a big fan of raw shrimp, and I much prefer them to be cooked. All in all, I didn't enjoy the slimy texture.

Tuna ceviche ($7.50)- Another sashimi-like dish. I thought the flavours were bright and refreshing. 

Chicken fritto ($12)- can't comment because I only had a bite of it. The general sentiment was that people enjoyed it. The chicken was topped with a mountain of cilantro, which could almost be a salad itself. 

Spicy squid ($9), one of my favourite dish of the night. I loved the sweet and tangy sauce that coated the squid, and it was well-complemented by green onions, cilantro, and avocado chunks.

Pozole rojo ($12 for large)- a hearty pork and tripe soup accompanied with more of those delicious chips. There was a great deal of meat in the soup, making it more like a stew. My friends commented that it tasted like Korean pork bone soup. For me personally, there was too much meat in the soup, although the flavours were rich and bold. I also didn't think that the chips paired well with the soup, and I would've preferred to have some bread instead.

There were 5 options available that night.

Baja fish- I thought it was quite tasty. The fish was moist and fried nicely, but overall, I think I prefer the fish taco from La Carnita. 

Pork belly al pastor- I particularly loved the contrast between the rich and fatty pork belly and the sweetness of the pineapple! It packed a mouthful of flavour and just kept luring me back for more bites! 

Beef cheek- the beef was juicy and incredibly flavourful, and the overall combination of all the toppings (green onions, jalapeños, cilantro and avocado) was very satisfying. The jalapeños gave a kick of heat, but the taco, as whole, wasn't very spicy. More hot sauce please!

Fried queso & poblano- the cheese was appropriately mild and didn't overpower the sautéed poblano peppers, which was very tasty. 

Spicy arbol chicken- not very memorable, and certainly not very spicy. That was probably my least favourite taco of the night. 

Dessert time- two options: key lime and chocolate & pecan. My favourite one was, hands down, the mini key lime pudding, which consisted of a layer of graham cracker crust, key lime filling, and topped with whipped cream. I loved the tangy filling and I loved the graham cracker crust even more! 

In comparison, the chocolate & pecan pudding was rather disappointing. Even though the portion was small, the pudding resembled fudge, and was much too rich and heavy. I didn't like it at all. 

It was a satisfying meal, even though Mexican food is not my favourite genre. I had lots of fun chatting and laughing in the lively atmosphere. I wouldn't rush to come back any time soon, given its no-reservation policy. The food was good, but it wasn't awesome for me. Nevertheless, I had a great experience here, and I'm really glad I finally tried the food."}
{"text":"Love the bright-coloured picnic table right in front of the front window!

We went for lunch and luckily it wasn't that busy at all so there wasn't much of a wait for the food and the waitress (forgot her name but she says she's been there four years) was quite nice.

I only had the fish taco and the chicken taco - both were good. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service. Was lucky enough not to wait in line when i got there, maybe that helped my experience. The pork shoulder was a tad dry. Other than that the food was delicious! baja fish is always a must and the beef cheeks are delicious too!"}
{"text":"Extremely busy but worth it.  Typically have to wait about an hour - but the Cadillac Lounge has an outdoor patio pretty much right next door where you can have a drink or two until they text you to come over.

The fish tacos are among the best in the city and, a rarity, they not only have ceviche but do it amazingly well.  

My only gripe is that it is too loud and makes conversation strained.  Otherwise the atmosphere is great and the small size keeps it intimate."}
{"text":"I love the tacos here! With all of the great Mexican restaraunts to choose from in the city, Grand Electric is surely my favourite. The tuna ceviche is top notch, and the fish tacos have the perfect combination of flavours. I love that they are always playing old-school rap, and the bourbon list and cocktails are awesome. Only drawback is that on the weekends there is a bit of a wait, and it's too loud for my parents- but otherwise 5/5."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Great scene, friendly staff and awesome tacos. The Baja fish and cauliflower are my favorite. But my guilty pleasure is the coconut cream dessert...it's what keeps me coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"Waited for two hours only to be told that we wouldn't have a table for another hour. I think being able to eat is just as important of a factor as how the food tastes, and grand electric fails miserably on that count. 
Don't go here if you plan on actually eating that day."}
{"text":"Food is yummy but portions are tiny for the price (compared to Seven Lives taste + size), therefore I can only give a 3-star. Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"A little neighborhood establishment in the West end of Toronto.  Space is ... squished.  Food tasted good, but for the price though, the quantity is dismally minimum.  Under the category of Dinner, we ordered Tuna Ceveche, and when it came, we thought it was more like an appetizer.  We also ordered the dinner special of Shrimps with White Rice for about $15.  There were only 5 shrimps!  I was so sad."}
{"text":"My first visit was with a friend from out of town who is, ahem, hard to impress. But we were both very happy by the end of our meal. 

My friend likes to put servers to work and bases his meal selection entirely on their recommendation. Our server did an ACE job. She was able to answer all out questions and gave us her honest opinion on preferences. Her recommendations for my friend based on his mood in the moment were spot-on. 

We ended up having the Baja Fish, Scrapple and pork tacos, and Pozole between the two of us. A Liberty Ale for myself and the new Jesus Juice cocktail for my friend. 3 tacos and the Pozole was enough to fill us up and keep the bill low, but I could see myself going another day and downing more tacos in one sitting. 

I was worried what the wait would be like on a nice Friday afternoon since I've tried to go before during dinner and been faced with an hour wait, but we were seated right away and even had a choice of where to sit. 

I can't wait to go back when the weather is even nicer to try out their patio."}
{"text":"I give it a \"meh\" We weren't overly impressed. It was all a little bland. The service wasn't friendly either. It's fine, but don't expect to be blown away. People fall for the hype of this place I think."}
{"text":"My name is Evelyn and I'm an eat-out-aholic. 

I live in Parkdale and I love patios, tequila and hipster twists on classic Mexican. So what kept me away from Grand Electric for so long? Lines. Lines and fearing it wouldn't live up to the hype. But guess what? It did! I had a five effing star experience here just yesterday.

I went at 3pm between their rushes, and enjoyed a paloma and a margarita and two tacos on their sunny back patio. It was delightful. If you, too, haven't popped your GE cherry, I highly recommend treating yourself one weekday afternoon."}
{"text":"We had the pork belly taco, crispy pork salad, empanadas, guacamole and chips.

Were good but a tad on the sweet side. Queso fundido was deliciouso. 

Great service for a very very small place. Line can be long, so come early."}
{"text":"The tacos were AMAZING and since we came for lunch there was no line and we walked straight in! The Caesar was good but almost too spicy and not enough other flavours! The Baja fish taco, beef cheeks and chicken are must tries.... Actually, just try them all. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Must tries:
   Tuna ceviche
   Crispy cauliflower taco
   The spicy squid is pretty good as well"}
{"text":"Love going to this place. It's one of my favourite places for tacos, next to seven lives. The only negative I'd say about this place is that it's pretty far from where I live, so it's kind of inconvenient to get to. However, the tacos are very delicious. I tried all of the tacos on the menu except for the crispy cauliflower. My favourite has always been the baja fish and beef cheek. Their menus change slightly once in a while but those two items are always on there."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place in the city for tacos! Everything on their menu is delicious and reasonably priced Imo. The flavours of their tacos are outstanding and complex, and each one leaves you wanting for more! Luckily, you'll have the ability to try a variety of them, since each taco is only 2 or 3 bites in portion size (beef cheek taco is my favourite!) . Although small, I find the tacos to be very filling and most people would probably get full from eating 4 to 5 of these. 

The other popular dish I always get from this place is the ceviche! The jalapeños in it give it a nice kick-and don't forget to try it with the tortilla shell at its base! =) 

The downside about eating here, however, is the long wait times to get a table. As the place does not take reservations, you'll have to arrive early to put your name down on the wait list. You can safely assume the wait to be at least 30 minutes on weekdays, and probably more than an hour on weekends. If you just want to try the food here without the dine in experience, you can save some time by ordering take out instead =) 

My greatest wish would be for them to open another location outside of Parkdale! That way I can get my taco fix on more frequently =D"}
{"text":"We tried loads of different things from the menu and everything was fantastic!  The beef cheek tacos and baja fish tacos were outstanding and exceptionally fresh.  The Mexican Patatas were brilliant.   Soooooooo good.  We'll definitely come back here.
The environment itself is small and intimate, but the music is seriously loud and a bit intrusive.  We went on a Thursday night and didn't have to wait at all."}
{"text":"Saw a huge line up, got in line to see what was up. Got seated. Ordered chips and guac, nailed it. Ordered every taco on the menu, nailed those too. Wanted more. Ordered spicy squid, nailed all of them. Wanted more. Felt like a beached whale. Decided against it. The end."}
{"text":"To be fair, I visited Toronto in Summer '17 and randomly wound up here + had an amazing experience (4-5 stars). 

Came back into town Winter '17 and made this one of my first stops based on the first experience -- sadly, this one was terrible (0 stars). 

First, the wait staff was endlessly confused (seemed like the two working waitresses were competing for our table, so we'd place an order with one and then the other would show up 2 seconds later to do the same thing. This happened 3x times, not a huge issue in the grand scheme of things).

Then things really went sideways. I wanted to get the chicken wings (which I had on visit 1, and were amazing then) but when I asked to get it \"without the crema\" I was told in the most condescending tone that \"we don't do modifications here.\" Guess I missed the part where they won a Michelin star and thought that their $9.99 wings were the best on the planet/not to be messed with. Ugh, fine, I guess, I really want those wings... Then when they finally arrived they're basically lathered with some gross white spooge that could have EASILY not been applied from whatever squeeze bottle in the back it came from, utterly disgusting. If this was a soup or something made en masse I'd understand the \"no modifications\" thing, this was a freaking add on that I didn't want but was forced to take. Beyond stupid.

The final straw was when the check came and they messed up the bill. When we pointed to the menu and asked them to please fix the mistake the same b-word waitress angrily shot back with \"well let me go check with my manager.\" Not, \"oh yeah let me go fix that\" or anything remotely agreeable... 5 minutes later she returns and tosses a loonie at us with a \"here\" -- nevermind the tax/tip would now be off because of it. I know, I know, \"it's just a dollar\", but really at this point it was the principle of the thing and F this place in the ear.

Bottom line: Get over yourself, you hole-in-the-wall dive restaurant that can't do math..."}
