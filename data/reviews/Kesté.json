{"text":"Non-pretentious with fresh and tasty pizza - hard to go wrong. We split some house salad and a nice margeurita pizza, which had great Italian-style crust. Others had pasta which was also apparently very good. Seems like a great place for groups as well... Would recommend."}
{"text":"Solid, laid back dining experience. 

The place is open and airy with a mix of young, old and families and an open-concept pizza station with a kitchen behind it (no wood fired oven sadly).

The service was quick and attentive and the margherita pizza was DELICIOUS - great sauce, just enough cheese and a nice, tasty thin crust (take it from someone who rarely eats the crust)....I ate every bite and wasn't left feeling bloated or overly full. (Cheers to the authentic Neapolitan pizza chef!)

Reasonable wine list and a nice $25 table d'hote menu which includes a glass of wine."}
{"text":"Fantastic Meal from beginning to end!!!! Authentic Italian food like my mom used to make.
Eggplant parmigiana so luscious it melts in your mouth, meatballs, homemade ricotta
and smoked mozzarella cheese!! Linguini with clams, grilled fish and amazing octopus.
This chef can cook!!!! Incredible pizza that is flavorful, smokey and delish
Bravo chef Gianlucca"}
{"text":"Affordable pizza/pasta in comfortable setting. Service was attentive and thin crust pizza came really quickly. The $5 glass of wine was tasty. Overall a solid and laid-back dining option."}
{"text":"When you walk into a place and it smells like you've walked into a pizzeria in Italy, it's a good sign. We were not disappointed. There were 10 of us and we all loved our meals. My intention was to have pizza but when I saw the papardelle with porcini come out of the kitchen, I changed my mind in a hurry. Absolutely delicious. (we split a pizza for dessert). I will continue to go back."}
{"text":"I went here for a Christmas party and the food was good. Really good!  We were a huge group (we took over half the restaurant) and we're served family style, passing plates of food. We tried so many different items off the menu, and just about everything was lip smacking delicious. I'm part Italian, so I have high standards when it comes to Italian restaurant food, and this passed the test!  Even better is that because the restaurant specializes different region than the one my family is from, I got to try some regional specialties I had never tried before (and lots that I was familiar with). My favorite dish of the evening was the grilled squid on the black rice, sounds so simple but was so tasty!

The service was very decent considering what a big group we were.  The wait staff were consistently in a good mood.  My only suggestion to the restaurant for future group meals: more serving utensils!  It was a little awkward at first when most dishes were missing serving utensils, so we either needed to share or use our knives and forks.  After awhile though, once everyone was stuffed full of good food and drink, no one cared anymore.

Bonus points to the restaurant for having (at least one, that I saw) high chair and change tables in the bathrooms.  They seemed unphased by the toddler in our group, so I'm making a mental note to come back some time with my infant one sunny weekend afternoon, when we're in the mood to enjoy some thin crust pizza while sitting in front of the huge windows."}
{"text":"A good restaurant should feel like an orchestra, where every instrument and player comes together in harmony, together creating something more amazing then the sum of its parts. Although keste has some great high notes, the overall experience lacked a real sense of harmony, leaving us a little disappointed.

First, the good. Well, the highest compliment must go to the pizza crust, which was absolutely delicious. Thin, crisp, cooked to perfection, it truly was the highlight of the night. I typically never eat the crust endings, but actually had them here. The variety of pizza toppings was also great, with options like eggplant, ricotta, spicy arrabiatta, and many more. Another very positive note, was how easy going the staff were about us having a baby. They even made it a point to emphasize that they are a family restaurant, which was very nice. The ambiance was also quite enjoyable. 

Now, for the not so good. Well, despite the pizza dough being delicious, the pizzas were just okay. It's like the remained of the pizza toppings didn't compliment the dough as it should to elevate it to the next level. Moreover, the prices were quite steep, especially compared to other top Montreal pizzerias. Given the higher price point, we expected more. 

So it really depends on what you're looking for to know if keste is right for you."}
{"text":"Went for a quick lunch. Their pizza is very authentic!  fresh tomato sauce and the pizza crust itself was delicious! Wish there was a bit more cheese though:("}
{"text":"Excellentes pizzas, pareil pour la spécialité, La kesté (une sorte de pizza roulée et frite), très bons vins, grande terrasse, personnel efficace et sympathique. Je n'ai jamais mangé à l'intérieur mais cela nous a semblé très bruyant quand nous y sommes passés."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. Very good variety of pizzas and a few other selections (pasta, panini) for those who are not in the mood. The food is good and the terrace is nice."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Italian restaurants I've ever been to. Inside is really beautiful and cozy. 

The service was amazing. The waiter was checking on us a lot, he was really helpful with the menu, and the food came quick. 

The food was magnificent! My dish; Fresca pizza with prosciutto was super tasty. My sister loved her dish; the Gigi pizza with ricotta and mushrooms. My mom had a shrimp risotto dish, she finished it super fast because she loved it so much. My dad had a Calazone, which is a fried stuffed pizza and he thought it was amazing. For desert I had cannolis which were so good. 

The prices were reasonable. Overall I really recommend this restaurant to everyone, the service was great, and the food was amazing."}
{"text":"Attended a party of a friend here and we were 15-16 people. 
It's very convenient that they let you bring your own cake and there's free parking at the school nearby. 

Since we were a big group I expected service to be slower but they did get quite a few things wrong which slowed us down a little. (Entrees were wrong, drinks took long)

The food was fine, pizzas and entrees. I think it's quite expensive for the quality but for all the other benefits you get, it's fair. 

The size of the pizzas could be enough for 2 but you can eat one on your own if you have a medium appetite."}
{"text":"Tried out this local resto in the mile end area for #pizzafestmtl and loved their pizza!  The resto ambiance is quite cozy and has a homey feel to it with it's white and red checked tablecloths. Great for groups or for evening out with friends or dinner for two!  Now for the food..I must say I was really impressed with their pizza! Light thin crust wood oven pizza toped with delicious fresh ingredients and super tasty tomato sauce. We went on a Monday and it was super busy. They also have a lovely terrace. So if you are in the mile end area be sure to check this place out ..you won't be disappointed! Service was warm and friendly which always makes a dining experience extra special. They offer a wide variety of pizza's including choices of white pizza! Also recommend their red sangria. Don't miss out on their yummy tiramisu or mini cannoli's.  Yum Yum will definitely go  back!"}
{"text":"Nous avons partagé le kesté (très bon, je vous laisse découvrir), la salade de roquette (ah oui! On ne passe pas à côté), la croquette de pomme de terre (miam, et la sauce...). Le dessert, pizza Nutella tiède, extra. Des serveurs attentionnés, professionnels et gentils.
Et en plus de tout cela, grande sympathie : un chanteur de rue s'est arrêté avec sa guitare, affamé, il nous a chanté sa tune, ce qui n'était pas autorisé, mais ... Le patron lui a offert une pizza en repas, alors bravo! Moi j'aime.
Et en été, la terrasse!"}
{"text":"Always ready to try new neighbourhood restaurants and Keste, I have to say is a most welcome addition to the neighborhood.  Excellent pizza"}
{"text":"Kesté (verb) - Italian: Questo É
                       English: It is what it is

Nice ambiance and the pizza was good, however, we made the mistake of ordering their specials and they just weren't very gosh darn special. Pre-packaged cherry tomatoes and arugula from PA for cryin' out loud!? In this city, during this season? C'mon! Go to the market, guys!

In the end, it was what it was."}
{"text":"Restaurant italien très sympa et surtout très bon. Les pizzas sont fraîches, les ingrédients aussi. Un choix de pizzas du jour existe et je vous le recommande. 

La terrasse qui donne sur la rue demeure calme et agréable (en août). Le personnel est sympa et disponible.

C'est un endroit que je recommande fortement !"}
{"text":"The service is excellent! The waiter patiently explain to us. They are having Easter meal set (full course) with fantastic meal. 
My others friend are non meat eater, the chef modified into seafood meal set for them."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I'm sure the drinks are really good, skip the food especially the French dip and the tartar. Horrible."}
{"text":"On a round, brief stop only trip to Montreal the other day I stumbled upon Kesté whilst looking for another place. Parking dt Montreal is always a crapshoot so when we saw a spot we figured what the heck let's take our chances on finding an eatery close by and voilà - whomp, there it is ... Neither I nor my son whom I was travelling with knew of Kesté but were drawn in by its welcoming boho appearance. Reminiscent of Toronto's Descendants Pizza with its communal style seating and pared down decor we chose a table on the sidewalk patio and said out loud simultaneously \"how French ne c'est pas?\" I love my kid. Anyway enough preamble ... I chose the tagliolini, which my auto correct wants to change to tag lion link as I type and the kid, well he's 24 but my baby he'll always be, ordered the Margherita Napolitan pizza. Getting to it, the pizza rocked both our worlds - everything you've ever been promised about this type of thin crust pizza come true on a plate. I'd like to say the same about my tagiolini and it wasn't awful but simply okay. Had the waiter asked if I wanted the small $14. option instead of automatically bringing the large serving at $18., I may be writing with more generosity. 
The noodles were al dente but the flavour profile needed something like lemon and some garlic and the presentation was lacklustre, I mean it's a plate of noodles with mushrooms so dress it up! Service was good, wine overpriced but what else is new since 1980. 
We would def go back."}
{"text":"J'ai découvert ce restaurant italien par pur hasard, comme le restaurant ou je pensais aller luncher de façon tardive fermait à 15h. Nous avons poursuivi notre marche et en regardant le menu, j'ai été vraiment tenté d'essayer l'endroit. Les prix sont quand même significatifs, mais côté qualité cela en a valu la peine. J'ai choisi la pizza végétarienne avec zucchini, poivrons rouges, basilic et mozzarella fraîche. La pâte était parfaite, je pense que j'ai rarement goûté une pâte aussi fraîche, aussi goûteuse, j'avais l'impression de manger un beignet ou une sorte de pain naan.... J'ai du mal à décrire les saveurs, mais disons que je n'étais pas déçue de mon choix et qu'il était clair que la pâte avait été conçue d'une recette propre au restaurant. Je rajoute que le service avait été un peu lent, mon copain avait été le seul servi (son burger avec pâte a pizza semblait excellent)... Pour s'excuser le chef, nous a préparé un grand bol de frites maisons avec mayonnaise maison également. Franchement, rien à redire! 
En fait j'aurais pu facilement donner 5 étoiles à l'établissement. Le restaurant était propre, des couleurs vibrantes, une terrasse avec quelques tables et une nourriture fraîche et de qualité. Le seul bé mol fut le moment ou les deux chefs se sont mis à se disputer en pleine cuisine. La salle à manger était vide, nous étions les seuls clients sur la terrasse et nous pouvions les entendre. Un manque de professionnalisme qui aura nuit à leur image. Dommage :( Mais tant pis, j'y retournerais volontiers!
PS leur limoncello en drink est juste WOW... Un petit verre a 8$ mais qui doit être tester."}
{"text":"A number of restaurants have come and gone at this location in the past few years, which worries me because I really hope that Keste would stay.Their service is good and price is as you'd expect for this kind of place in Montreal: $12- $18 a pizza.  For that you get to eat authentic Napolitano pizza crust: you know, the thin but easily chewy, air puffed and delightfully burnt in a few spots. You also will be thankful that the pie isnt overloaded with toppings which lets that wonderful crust really shine.  My favorite is the white pizza with egg, bacon and rapini. It's savoury but not excessively salty.  If you like anchovies, apparently that's good too, according to my anchovy-eating husband. You might want to try this place at your earliest convenience in case they don't end up staying!"}
{"text":"My parents in-law are in town are renting a nearby place. After the long flight they wanted to grab some food, not something to fency but still good foid. This place was perfect. The service was fast and good and everything we ordered (anchovies an zucchini salad, red pizza, white pizza and pasta) was superb the desert was also amazing the only downside is that the espresso is Lavatzza and not a better coffee but thats my personal taste. Reasnable priced great food, this place hust joined the \"I need to revisit\" list"}
{"text":"Kesté is hands down Montreal's best pizza. Keep in mind that they're not only great at making pizza, but their menu offers a lot of delicious classics straight from the motherland of Napoli. 
Kesté is quickly becoming a staple name in the Montreal culinary scene."}
{"text":"I came here with my folks and we ordered from the specials on the board: entrecôte steak, shrimp and rappini pasta, and zucchini salad. The place is very unpretentious but classy at the same time (red and white checkered table cloth but real cloth) and the food is nothing short of incredible. It was so good we decided to come back the next day to try the pizza and of course had to get another of their amazing fresh made pasta. The pizza is so good, real napolitana fresh tomato sauce crispy and airy at the same time! Will definitely be back and upon learning of their Monday pasta deal i will be a regular!"}
