{"text":"My husband and I started coming here since the Roasting Co. changed FOH management. We are big advocates of the daily specials, haven't had a bad one yet. As for drinks and the bar we like to steer clear, my drinks are always way too strong and the margaritas have a funky taste to them (probably the sour mix). But friendly staff and cool concept, haven't tested out the very large patio yet, but will try it out as soon as it cools off outside!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Amherst, and used to think very highly of Moosehead, however, my visit recently has definitely changed my opinion. I went in for dinner around 7, and we were one of 4 or 5 tables. The whole time, we felt very rushed, which was odd because their hours would indicate that they closed at 8:30pm. Later we were told that they wanted to close early because business was slow, that's why we were being rushed. In addition to the awful customer service we received, both of our order of ribs were burnt and the vegetables were rubbery as if they'd been reheated. Overall, even though we are repeat customers to Moosehead, this experience will definitely make us think twice about whether or not to return in the future."}
{"text":"I got food poisoning the last time I ate here as did my girlfriend. We had the burgers plus the waitress was rude, would not recommend."}
{"text":"Their hours are not at 11:30 on Monday. I drove 20 minutes to get some BBQ and they were closed, don't open till 4 pm. Another couple came & was upset they weren't open either! Ridiculous. Too bad cause they have good food,"}
{"text":"Been enjoying Moose Head for many years to grab a quick cocktail with friends after work. Donnie Blackened wings kick butt! Wait staff has been around for years and will enjoy getting to know you."}
{"text":"I don't care for their bbq ... probably cause I'm a bit of a bbq snob, BUT I ventured back, TWICE, after a bad experience and I have to say that their ribeye steak is AMAZING!!!! Service, on both subsequential visits, was MUCH better!! One of my go-to places now when I'm in the mood for a great steak!  I must add that the price for the ribeye with fresh cut fries is only $19.99! Bonus!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent but kind of costly for the portion size, servers were slow and not very friendly.  Probably wouldn't go here again"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch.  Our waitress took care of us and recommended a slight change to our order.  We were not disappointed.  Service was excellent!  Clean restaurant and restrooms."}
{"text":"First off, people who don't \"get it\" don't belong at this bar anyway.  From time to time there is someone like Eric K. who reviewed on 12/02/2008 who just don't \"get it.\"  Moosehead has INCREDIBLE food for a pub/dive bar.  I mean, who goes to a dive and cries about sticky seats and staircases?  I don't suggest he try going again.  He is \"That Guy\" who has decided not to fit in there.  They have a great selection of beer.  Try the ACME Pale Ale in a bottle or any of your favorites on tap.  Their wings have always been the best in Charlotte.  Try the Bee Stings and/or the Blackened.  Smothered burritos all the time, meatloaf Mondays, larger than normal popcorn shrimp Friday lunches, chicken sands and burgers all the time.  Always awesome!  I moved from Charlotte ten years ago and I will always miss this place and visit every time in town.  I was a regular for 2 years.  It is why I know so much about it.  If you are looking for a place in the Park Road Shopping Center Neighborhood to let your hair down and not take yourself too seriously then this is the place for you.  The jukebox is great and has been known to, more often than occasionally cause dancing on the tables.  Halloween was always a HUGE party and friendships struck at Moosehead last forever.  I never go without seeing someone I know even after ten years and if you need a home bar go hang out several times and sit at the bar.  Talk to the bartender, sometimes he is Chris the owner.  Soon you will have a lot of cool new friends."}
{"text":"Best wings in town are the killer bee stings.  Plenty of indoor, outdoor and upper deck seating. Solid craft beer selection and one of a kind decor.  A local favorite."}
{"text":"went here a few weeks ago with my BF he ordered a steak it arrived and he asked for some A1 sauce, they said they were completely out! Really? little disappointed in that the waiter was very friendly and the food arrived in reasonable amount of time, little pricy"}
{"text":"I was a first time visitor last night, and I really enjoyed it!  I ordered the Santa Fe Salad, and the portion was huge- there had to have been 2 chicken breasts sliced on top of the salad, so it was definitely worth the $10.99 I paid.  The service and atmosphere were decent, nothing to speak of, but the quality of the food made it worth the trip.  I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Love the food and the service is good. I often order carry out on my way home from work and I love the fact that they have a drive up window to pick up carry outs, very convenient however their customer service on the phone is pretty bad."}
{"text":"I have lived on the road for the past 5 years. I've stayed in a hotel every night for the duration of this period. During this time I have eaten at a restaurant 3 meals a day for at least 5 days per week. I've been to every state, every major city, and many small towns across the US. Why does all of this matter? Well, I put the Moosehead Grill as my overall #1 bar/restaurant in the entire country. The combination of atmosphere, price, service, food, and drinks is unbelievable and something I rarely find around the states. Everyone I have brought in was not only welcome with open arms, but continues to go back because of how amazing this place is. Do yourself a favor and try this place out. From the beesting wings to the outdoor patio, and legendary jukebox, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great brisket, really good soups, the BBQ sampler is my family's favorite. It's clean, lovely decor. Good family place. I have never ever heard the owner yelling or cursing at his staff, he rounds on his customers frequently asking how their food is. It's no more expensive than an Olive Garden or Red Lobster. We go about once a month and food and service is consistently good."}
{"text":"hands down the best bar food in charlotte.  the best wings I have ever had, great quality meat in their burgers, and everything else on the menu is incredible.  the specials will blow you away, they are very inventive and you will not find a better bargin on quality and presentation.  lee f. said it best, \"people who don't get it don't belong\"  Eric K's review is garbage, especially about the cost of drinks.  they have more than resonable beer prices and if you can get a better pour in charlotte, let me know.  the staff are all great and have been around for a while, and hopefully many more years to come.  if you don't like great music (especially out of georgia) then this place may not be for you either.  God bless the freaks!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent, but having said that, the food was horrible. I got the BBQ sampler, meat was dry and rubbery, brisket was watered down, ribs fell off the bone but there was no taste, and the pulled pork crunchy."}
{"text":"When I first moved back to Charlotte from Raleigh, some of my new co-workers told me to meet them at Moosehead for dinner. I had no clue what they were talking about, I had never heard of the place. When I got to the address they gave me, I recognized the building right away. It was a Pizza Hut I had been to a few times before I left.  Boy am I glad it's not a Pizza Hut anymore...I love Moosehead!  I go there as often as possible even though I am surrounded by restaurants and bars in Ballantyne where I live. It's always a diverse crowd, and the staff and regulars are friendly to talk to. I have yet to eat anything there that wasn't short of amazing.   If you like wings, go with the Bee-Stings and never look back. I was scared to try them at first, but after having them, they easily became the best wing I've ever had, hands-down. The Bee-Stings are #1 on my recommended foods there, and I'd have to put the BBQ Nachos at #2. There is so much flavor in their BBQ. The only thing negative I can say is that they don't always have them (there is a great reason for this though.) They won't let you settle for sub-par BBQ. This is the South, and if the BBQ doesn't taste good enough, they don't offer it.   When it comes to their portions, I feel like a kid again. I can hardly ever finish a plate. Their chicken fingers are huge (one was actually bigger than the brim on my hat one time), their fried cheese appetizer could feed a small African village for a week, and you'd think that you might find buried treasure once you get to the bottom of a plate of nachos. A word to the wise, take your friends there to help you eat what you can't finish. Share the chicken fingers, share the nachos, share the fried cheese...but with the Bee-Sting wings, eat them until your lips go numb! If you want a specialty drink that's great any time of the year...ask for a Moose-Knuckle...you can thank me later."}
{"text":"Nasty, rednecky place. Greasy southern food and TV's turned up LOUD to appeal to the fat, obnoxious local sports lunkheads.  Yee-hawww - not."}
{"text":"Best wings in Charlotte. They have several unique styles. Bee Sting are sweet and have a bite. No one can touch their Buffalo wings, my favorite. Also try the Buffalo Shrimp, they are great for sharing. Uncle Donny's blackened wings will not disappoint. I have tried a couple of styles of the nachos Moosehead serves and the Yard Bird Nachos are my favorite. You can order a 1/2 serving which is a meal for one or a full order to share with up to four (my opinion). Moosehead offers a variety of beers on tap and their music selection is ALWAYS great. Bartenders and servers are always attentive. Yes there are plenty of choices in Charlotte for wings but Moosehead Grille is the best."}
{"text":"Great wings and service!  Loud and lots of drunk people, but the amazing wings totally make up for it!"}
{"text":"I'm posting this review since my original was taken down (lack of substance). However, my review was completely legitimate, I just didn't feel like elaborating on the situation. I was out with my husband recently and we stopped into Moosehead. It seemed like a laid back environment. That's until we heard the owner and friends making comments (I'll refrain from the specifics) about Jewish people.  My husband and I being a Jewish couple from New York confronted the owner. He defended what was said and pretty much told us to get used to it because we are down in the south. Not a place I want to spend my evenings in Charlotte. Enough said...."}
{"text":"I would give it a 3, but the ribs are really pretty good. After the ribs, the thing that keeps me coming back is how close it is to my house. Oh, and unless you bring it with you, there is no atmosphere to speak of."}
{"text":"This place has become a staple lunch stop for me and a few of my work buddies. The food is always top-notch (try their meatloaf or chicken tenders tossed in blood orange/ghost pepper \"hemogoblin\" sauce) Don't expect any phoniness (read chain restaurant) out of the staff here, they are the real-deal, genuine and give this place great character. Oh and the roof top is awesome too :)"}
{"text":"I came for the blackened wings and am sure to return for them. I easily could have eaten two more orders of these things but my diet limits me to only 30. I got a side salad as well to keep things healthy. The ranch was fantastic too. Got a nice taste of vegetables with the celery and carrots accoutrement."}
{"text":"The ribs aren't smoked in a smoker anymore, had the pulled pork also,and I could tell it wasn't smoked in a smoker. Complete fraud, and I used to love this place. So sad that they are cutting corners and putting out terrible food these days."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. Never had a bad meal or anything but outstanding service here. Moosehead. would get 5 stars if they improved their restrooms."}
{"text":"This place has an excellent location on SR 58 close to I-90 and I-80. The menu is perfect. The food is worth the drive from where you are sitting right now!"}
{"text":"The Moosehead Grill has been one of my favorite dive bars for years! The lunch specials are fantastic, $10 which includes a drink. For dinner, I highly recommend asking for the specials board because I've had everything from scrumptious Meat Loaf to perfectly cooked Cornish Game Hens. This place is the great!   Favorites: - Wings, Nachos, Chicken Sandwiches and the Daily Specials"}
{"text":"Been looking for \"a spot\" in charlotte now for 4 weeks. Finally found it. Great wings! G-man is the MAN!!! Great food & great service! I'll be back next week!"}
{"text":"Man, I really used to love this place. Just see my past review.  Went to Moosehead today, Veteran's Day, for a little escape and to enjoy some wings and good bar food. It's always felt like a friendly neighborhood bar. In fact, while we were eating my husband lamented how many good locals were being lost to \"gentrification\" and we both said we hoped it never happened to Moosehead.  Our lunch was cut short when the guy who appeared to be managing the shift came over to the table of two guys next to us. He wasn't professional enough to keep his hatefulness and ignorance inside, choosing instead to loudly started complaining with them about the \"douchebags\" and \"pussies\" who had protested a Trump win. Then, all three poor, victimized, disenfranchised white men  started complaining about how people were calling them \"racists\" because they voted for a man who eagerly incites racist violence.  I came here to escape this kind of ugliness. I won't be returning. And in fact, I hope \"gentrification\" eventually puts this bar and the hateful, sexist, ugly people running it out of business, and soon."}
{"text":"All of the sauces are very good. In fact, I've enjoyed most everything I've had there. The bartender, Josh, is attentive and hilarious. The owner, Dave, wants nothing more but to make his customers happy."}
{"text":"It don't hurt that I know one of the owners, and get along with the family in general, but they have the best bar food in Charlotte. It must be uncle Donnie, because the other guy couldn't fix a pb and j. Their pork tenderloin was the first I had tried this, now it's one of my specialties, wings are always great, not a big adventure person in foods, but would try most stuff that came out of their kitchen."}
{"text":"I have dined here on several different occasions. The BBQ is delicious and tangy. Very flavorful. Several different homemade BBQ styles. The ribs are superb, fall off the bone. Smashed pot is great, italian style. I had the adult chicken fingers the last trip to Moosehead and they were just great. (I was not feeling too great, and wanted to try something different) I really recommend the BBQ of course, you won't be dissappointed. Everything is made fresh and the owner is just fantastic. Everyone is very friendly! Ask to try the sauces before you make your decision! Very casual. Nice selection of beer. Sam Adams is a must! Not extremely pricey but I would recommend going with friends or family so you can all get different things and share each others, if you don't finish your plate! They give you goooood sized portions! Have yet to try dessert, we always are soo full! Nice cupcake store next door!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, great atmosphere.  Perfect place for a beer after work.  The place has a no frills in your face kind of attitude.  Also is a nice change from the Applebees of the world, it has character."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch.  This place really goes all out for Halloween.  They were setting up a haunted maze for their evening customers.  I had the Gypsy soup (fresh cut vegetable winter soup) and a chargrilled chicken sandwich.  Both were delicious.  Great service, easy in and out. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Moosehead is a neighborhood bar with great food, reasonable prices and solid regulars."}
{"text":"Delicious food in a great location!! The drink selection is also great. We sat outside on the patio and were able to watch college football while eating. The service was pretty good, did seem a little slow and not sure if we were forgotten about or if the server was simply busy with other tables inside. Definitely won't hesitate to return though!"}
{"text":"Dirty, dirty, dirty! This restaurant is grossly dirty. The food was disgusting and took longer than an hour for us to get. Will never eat here again"}
{"text":"Moosehead Grill, I've passed it numerous times going down Montford, but never stopped in. It always looks packed and seems like a pretty cool place to kick it. So one day while on a \"Bike Bar Crawl\" I decided to pop in, I ordered the namesake's beer...The Moosehead, and my brother, buddy and I headed outside to climb the twisting staircase and hang out in the crows nest on the very top of the building. Very cool. Nice view, plenty of space and some convenient built in benches to sit back, soak up the rays and enjoy your Moosehead brew. I dug it, the Moosehead beer was good, for some reason it reminded me of a Rolling Rock, only better...maybe it's the green bottle. I am a big fan of the porch and crows nest. Chill place, I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Great oyster Po Boy!!!   Clean.  Cozy.  Excited to return and try the meatloaf or hamburger.  Beer selection looked solid.  Went for lunch so didn't get to partake. Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"The blackened wings are amazing!!! I will keep coming back here just for them. Decent atmosphere and nice outside area"}
{"text":"Some of the best wings to be had; the grilled wings and the hot wings are worth the drive. Fun funky feel. Good service and great selection of drinks."}
{"text":"Great wings, beers, bartenders. Hit it up this neighborhood joint, youll be happy you did."}
{"text":"Oh to Moosehead home of the happy pour, but make sure you get there between 5-10pm so you can enjoy the early dinner menu. I must say the fish tacos are the GREAT! If not you must try the wings, bring some friends and get a couple dozen wings.(blackened and the bee sting) best in all of Charlotte, not to mention the rest of the menu!+++++  They have great micro brews on draft that  will change with the season which is bad ass if you ask me. The bottle beers are great and forever changing, just ask the bartender/staff what's new or their favorite.  Last but far, far from least the atmosphere is great it can change at any given time especially at night in a entertaining way! Seating can get limited but they have a upper deck, covered patio, and a picnic table area. Oh yeah and a fun game you can play outside til a seat becomes available but it's ever a long wait. It truly is a diamond in the rough I love that place!!"}
{"text":"I have like Moosehead since I first came around ten years ago. The food is surprisingly good for a dive bar, and I like the atmosphere. I especially liked the wings.  Read More: http://eatitcharlotte.com/2016/06/23/moosehead-grill/"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a road trip, and wish I would have went to McDonalds. Everyone was rude to me, I had to wait for 15 minutes just to get my drink, and the burger was absolutely tasteless. I will never stop here again, and I recommend everyone stay away."}
{"text":"Service: Outstanding. Waitress was very attentive and friendly.  Made you feel like a part of the family.  Food: Portions were large for the money and tasted great.  Ambiance: Very well decorated and fun. Moose theme everywhere. A great place to have a casual meal.  Price: A good value considering the portions of the meals.  Overall: Definitely going back again when I'm up in the area."}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. I don't think I've ever been in a filthier bar than Moosehead Grill.  After a birthday party dinner, the group of friends wanted to go to Moosehead Grill for drinks.  Why, I don't know.  Apparently there's some appeal to them.    Moosehead Grill used to be a Pizza Hut, but now appears to be a giant mess with a two-level deck built on the front.  With our large group, we took up the entire upper level on the deck.  Sitting outside was nice (especially if you didn't get a sticky seat), but there was nary a server to be seen up there.  When we wanted a drink, we had a climb down the stairs to the crazy smoky bar area for a not-cheap beer.  Wait...they have food, too?  Wow.  I can't imagine eating here."}
{"text":"Borderline dive bar, which made it great! Came here for a late lunch and bellied up to the bar. Found a spot amongst the regulars there for a TGIF shot and a beer on their final lunch hour of the week. Bartender was a good guy wearing a Cubs shirt, which provided some great conversation considering I hail from the Midwest.   Ordered off the grease board that served as the menu and asked for a PBR of course. Had the fried turkey sandwich w/onion rings. Came with a side of au jus, which was great to dip the sandwich in. Highly recommend it! All and all a great joint that sits well in the Montford scene. Outdoor seating too!"}
{"text":"Friendly bartenders but kind of a dark and dingy place in general.  They don't have an amazing tap list by any means, but the beer was cold.  That is all I needed at that point.  I thought about grabbing some food as well, but the dingy vibe made me think otherwise.  It was a Friday night and their wasn't a single woman in the place, so me and my buddy just went elsewhere after our one beer.  Nothing special, but I guess this place has its regulars."}
{"text":"I had one of the best meals I've had in awhile this evening. I had the bbq sampler with the sweet potato and green beans. Loved the ribs,pulled pork, and brisket. Also the sweet potato and the sugar that accompanied it were perfect. While I liked how crisp the green beans were I thought they could have been flavored better with the bacon and garlic. Overall though I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner."}
{"text":"First time at Moosehead Grill today and got a to-go order.  Grilled chicken sandwich with blackened bacon was fab.  Also, tomato basil soup was divine.  Customer service was great as well.  The place doesn't look like much from the outside or inside, but give it a chance.  You won't be sorry.  I have found that the dumpiest looking places can have the best food and nicest people.  Price vs. food was a good value.  $10 even - includes entrée, side item, drink and even tax.  Big enough portions that you could make another meal out of if you're not an enormous eater.    Angela"}
{"text":"Just a great dive, man.    This is the 'don't give a f**k' drunk spot.  Like, if You're a here, you've already kicked back 1 or 15 elsewhere, and you're looking for some tasty bar food to prevent a late night reversal.  And, I must say, said bar food is oh. so. satisfying."}
{"text":"I have had the Ribs and the buffalo chicken sandwich. The ribs are some of the best I have ever had and the chicken sandwich literally took up the entire plate. This place is exactly what it says it is a BBQ. Not sure why some reviewers are expecting a menu like cheesecake factory. A BBQ restaurants serving BBQ food how weird.....  Very good food. Plan on reservations as it fills up quick."}
{"text":"Don't let this shabby dive-bar fool you; it has some of the best bar food in Charlotte! I'll repeat, it is a dive bar. The bathroom is not well kept, the floor doesn't look pristine, the service isn't always 100% and there will most likely be inebriated college-aged students stumbling around. But that's the charm, right?  It's located on Montford Drive, a popular nightlife area in South Park, across from 10 Park Lanes and if you have been on Montford late night, you know what to except. Parking is usually iffy, Mooseheads has their own small private lot but don't expect to score a spot. Keep an eye out along the road or park in the bowling alley across the street.  It has a smallish interior with seating booth and table seating and a large bar in the center. There are also 2 oddly arranged outdoor patios and an area with bar games.  The menu is pretty straightforward: burgers, wings, potato skins, sandwiches, fried cheese, quesadillas, nachos etc. They are most known for their wings, most notably, the bee stings. They also have specials you wouldn't expect from a dive bar: blackened mahi mahi, salmon etouffee, stuffed pork and more--you never know what head chef, \"G-man\" is going to be whipping up. I recommend the bee sting wings, nachos and whatever specials are available for the night.  I have never had an issue with service, even on busy nights. They may not be the most talkative, helpful and attentive servers you have ever had but again this is a dive bar on Montford Drive.  If you like bar food, especially wings, give this place a try and don't be afraid to order a special. Keep in mind Mooseheads is located in possibly the busiest late night entertainment district in Charlotte . Take it for what it is rather than trying to compare it to other places and I do not think you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Service:  Outstanding.  Bar tenders were awesome while we waited for our table.  Great drinks and super talkative/fun.  The food could've come a little quicker, esp considering we had a 3 yr old and it was a little late in the evening... but the place was packed, so whatever.  You'll have that.  The owner stopped by our table twice to talk and is a complete ball of energy.  If for no other reason, he'll make you want to come back (just to hang out/chat).   Food:  I had onion rings as an appetizer, and they were great.  Then, the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich came out.  Whoa... let me tell you, people.  If you like Buffalo Chx, you'll love this thing.  I'll warn you, however... IT'S HUGE.  HUUUUGE.  Share it with a friend - or two.  I took 2/3 home with me - but it was Fan-tastic.  Granted, I did have napalm poo the next morning... but it was really really good (and worth the post traumatic a$$ disorder).    Ambiance:  Very well decorated and fun.  A great place to have a casual meal.  Price:  Average and well worth it.  Fair at worst.    Overall:  Definitely going back again when I'm up in the area."}
{"text":"We stopped for a quick lunch on our way along the turnpike. My cheeseburger was excellent, and the fries were outstanding. Service was very prompt and friendly. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"How do more people not know about this place!?   The owner, Chris, is from Maine and you totally feel like you'r in a lodge in the place. Very cool decor and ambiance...now on to the food...  1. quite possibly the best clam chowder ive ever had  And i grew up in CT around tons of chowder spots.   2. wings. plain charred and bee sting. arguably the best in town. personally, they are my favorite and i usually only like wings slathered in sauce.   that's all i've had but i've seen other stuff that looks great. i should branch out but don't fix it if it's not broken, right?   also, $10 flat gets you a SOLID lunch."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying this place. The restaurant  itself was pretty cool and wish it was warmer so we could have sit outside. Our server was super friendly and funny which I appreciated.  I ended up ordering 5 buffalo wings and an order of traditional potato skins.  The buffalo wings were good and the blue cheese that came with it was even better. I really like the way their wings are cooked so they are meaty and have that little bit of crunch and of course, the sauce was good. The potato skins, I don't know maybe it's something you have to just eat right when it gets to your table, but I felt that they were a little dry and the ends of the potato were burned.  My friend ended up ordering the fried mozzarella which was TO DIE FOR. The fried mozzarella was DELICIOUS and you just knew it was fresh. Overall, I really like this place and plan on going again. Pretty chill atmosphere to enjoy a beer and the staff is really nice."}
{"text":"Great great wings, always and the atmosphere is fun just wish they had more friendly staff. Always feel as though I'm inconveniencing them when I need something such as ordering food, more drinks. We still come here occasionally because the food is great but it's never my first choice because the 'tude"}
{"text":"I simply cannot recommend this place. Bad service, terrible food. Can't imagine why anyone would want to go here..."}
{"text":"I recently dined here with a larger group to celebrate a birthday and I really wasn't  impressed.  The restaurant itself is wide open with a few booths along the walls and the majority of seating at open table in the middle of the restaurant.  There are no interior walls so it gets quite noisy in there during peak dining times.  It's extremely casual and the decor is very minimal.  Our waitress was decently friendly and the service was pretty good considering we had a table of 10.  The food, well....if you're not going to order the ribs, I suggest dining elsewhere.  The menu is mostly your standard bar/grill fare and I've had much better elsewhere.  I ordered one of the chicken sandwiches with a side salad and was thoroughly disappointed.  The side \"salad\" is literally a small plate of lettuce with no other vegetables.  The sandwich itself was fine, but the toppings were less than fresh and the entire thing was bland.  Another person at the table ordered the bbq chicken and left all but the mashed potatoes on her plate.  Apparently the chicken was so bad she couldn't eat it.  The only people at our table that were happy with their food were those that ordered the ribs.  Also, if you're a vegetarian be prepared to go hungry - there are really no veggie friendly items on the menu.  I definitely can't recommend going here.  You're honestly better off going to Chili's or Friday's."}
{"text":"3 years later and this still our favorite spot for beer and wings.  The sirloin chili nachos are the amazing.  I've found out that you can order them in half sizes too.  I always get the Donnie's blackened wings and my husband always gets the Killer Bees.  The Thai PB&J are amazing too.  The service is always impeccable no matter how busy it is.  Easily the BEST wings in the city."}
{"text":"Good for drinks, but after eating here twice I don't think my stomach can handle their food a third time."}
{"text":"Was there this past weekend. While the service was great...the food depending on who order what was okay. Fajitas should have some kind of kick to them and these where blah. Please add some spice and they will be awesome.   Who cut potatoes in half? Really...if you get them in and the are the size of a football fine but these where normal size ones and to only be given half...that is just crazy.  The server said that the cooks cut them because they are so big. If you want to see a big potato go to Morton's in Cleveland those are big potatoes. Now I am not saying the portions served where of bad size...that is far from true...they give you a good amount of food it's just odd to be give half a potato."}
{"text":"One of my go to spots when I'm in town visiting family. They often have fish (walleye, whatever is in season) as a special so keep that in mind. It's not on their menu online. Their starters are large enough to be a meal and their entrees come with two sides (one of which could be a side salad) so you get plenty of food. We're usually here with quite a large group. They've always been very accommodating.   My guilty pleasure here: the buffalo chicken rolls. I don't get them anywhere else. Only when I'm here! They're delicious!"}
{"text":"Was ok for a light lunch, really dont think I will be going back there."}
{"text":"Great place to sit down watch sports and enjoy good food in the Montfort area. Typically not too busy unless it's a late Saturday night. The people there are very friendly. If you can get past all the moose decor (there is legit a Moosehead there) then you'll be fine. The food is simple nothing too fancy. I ordered the Cajun nachos minus the sausage and chicken due to being pescatarian. They gave me so much for such a good price def got more bang for my buck. I was kind of disappointed they didn't serve any cocktail specials but they did have beer specials I'm just not a fan. I would still recommend to anyone in the area"}
{"text":"Conveniently located across from the Pappas Bowling alley, this place is a good spot to meet your friends before or after bowling.   I got a plate a nachos and it was huge! I was disappointed that I wasn't able to eat it all and you know that you can't save nachos.   Nothing spectacular on the inside, but it is what you would expect from a bar."}
{"text":"We ordered 1 day ahead for an order of 100 chicken wings. When we arrived to pick the wings up, they had not even started to prepare them. It was a one hour delay and the wings were not worth the wait. We were given a 50.00 voucher, but the hour delay was not cool"}
{"text":"A little bit of a dive bar but there wings are amazing!! The potato skins are also really really good. Service was excellent as well, you just have to realize it is mainly a bar-but don't let that scare you away!!"}
{"text":"Can't begin to explain how cool this place is. Most of the staff has been here since the place opened. Once you have been in a few times, everybody knows your name. I have been a big fan for 15 years. I don't cook so, I don't play when it comes to food. I have never had a meal here that wasn't exceptional. Steak and potato burrito is a must have. It's philly cheesesteak meat, mashed potatoes, topped with cheese and GRAVY! I always add sautéed mushrooms. Also, you won't get cheated on the drinks."}
{"text":"Just saying I love this place however the $$$$ on yelp shouldn't be four. Amazing wings but hey Yelp fix the cost this place is a good deal and not pricy."}
{"text":"Great set up and good food. Had the pot roast lunch and it was very tender. I would give it a try sometime."}
{"text":"Uncle donny's wings and a pint please!  Bottled beers are always ice cold and served up quick. Taps are full of personal favorites. Nachos with sirloin chili are a big hit. Lunch time with $10 specials are usually pretty good and it's crowded!  One beef is there are never beer or food specials. On the other hand, it's usually pretty busy so no reason why they need them I guess. They ever do a $0.50 wing night I'll be reaching for the Lipitor.   Great dive bar of choice, but friendly enough that plenty of people bring their kids."}
{"text":"The cheese dip here is in my top 3 favorites of all time! Love the rooftop area! Great bar!"}
{"text":"This locals place. My favorite Dive in CLT. Don't go looking for anything fancy.  The staff is always kind, the drinks are STRONG, the wings are outstanding.   It's a good late night place to go and you'll interesting people to talk to."}
{"text":"Best wings in Charlotte! Such a great local \"hole-in-the-wall\" type spot. The staff is awesome and the crowd is laid back. I've never had anything that I wouldn't recommend. And, they have a special menu that changes up from day to day!"}
{"text":"Moosehead has the absolute best wings in Charlotte. No question! They have several amazing flavors. I currently love the Killer Bee! You can also enjoy some nachos with the delicious queso they have or delightful fish tacos. Fries, onion rings and Mac & cheese are my favorite sides I always want all three! At lunch time they do a lunch special with an entree and side. Drinks are reasonably priced and staff is super helpful. If you love American bar food the way I do this place won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"$$$$??? That is odd, Moosehead isn't any more expensive than other dive bars in the area.   I've never had a bad meal or bad service here.  I usually get Killer Bees, PB&J, or Beestings (along with a Jam Session) and they are all amazing.  Their fries are batter coated and always really hot (get ranch or queso to dip, you're welcome). If you don't feel like fries, the Mac and Cheese is delicious! Their nachos are HUGE so if you get a full be ready to share.  Service is always great and G-man is always entertaining.  If you come during a slow time and sit up at the bar, sometimes he will experiment in the kitchen and let you taste his creations.  They never disappoint."}
{"text":"Have had lunch at Moosehead Grill several times as my sister lives in Amherst and always recommends them. Today was no exception.  The service is top notch. Today l chose the shrimp fajitas and cole slaw and a side of onion rings.  Note to self always order the onion rings.  This review is shorter than what l usually write but there is no need to expand on excellent service and delicious food. Try it out. Route 58 south of route 2."}
{"text":"Wow -- this is some good BBQ. Everything we had -- brisket, pulled pork, and ribs -- was really, really good, as were their sides. (We sampled green beans, baked beans, sweet potatoes, fries, mashed potatoes, and cole slaw among the 4 of us.) We have finally found great BBQ on the west side, albeit the further west side for those of us closer to Cleveland. It was worth the drive, and we'll definitely be back.  The only negative on our visit: friends server was s-l-o-o-o-w to refill drinks, as in we were darn near finished with our meals when she finally got back to us."}
{"text":"I think I simply come here just for the Sweet Potato Tots. They are scrumptious. I love how this pub is accepting of all walks of life. Everyone is family here, no one is staring or looking like you don't belong. Did I say the wings and Whiskey Sour is superb. And they have this great Wasabi sauce!!!! UGGGHHHHHHHHH so damn good.  One downfall is the parking is very limited but I guess you can park on the street somewhere and mosey your way down to them. At least that way you can work of the food and sober up a bit"}
{"text":"I am not huge on BBQ and was a little hesitant to try Mooseheads, but I was happily surprised. My very mediocre glass of pinot grigio was not a great start, but I was able to get past that. My salad before my main dish was not the best, but was fine. My main dish, however, was a special of the night. Mahi mahi with a mango salsa and asparagus. It was really good!! The mahi was cooked perfectly and not overdone. The mango salsa paired very well with it and the asparagus was cooked perfectly as well. The service was great. Our waitress was very attentive and efficient. The owner came around to all the tables to ask how our meals were. I always appreciate when people take the time to do that."}
{"text":"Hadn't been in 7 or 8 years, but nothing has changed except for the addition of a partition in the men's room. GMan and company are still serving up the best wings in CLT."}
{"text":"When I turned 13 my parents took me to this place, the pizza was good, but it was a pizza hut.  When I turned 21 I passed out at the bar.  I think this happened a couple more times before I was 23.  I used to put my chill down here a lot.  Good people, good food, good times.  On weekends you can usually leave with a good story to tell."}
{"text":"So hit or miss anymore, used to be one of my favorite places , it's such a shame..went today and decided to try the Cobb salad. The waitresses was awful, to start with no personality at all, never came back to check on us, had to get another severs attention to fill our drinks. For lunch you expect a short wait time after you order..it was at least 45 min....and they weren't busy. Then or salads finally came the Menu reads \" fresh mixed green's \" what came was a plate of iceberg lettuce right out of the previous packaged bag, you could taste and smell the plastic bag not washed or anything..very disappointing the fixings around the iceberg were good but the iceberg ruined it for both of us... The waitress walked buy and set the check on the table, didn't even slow down...then never came back..we had to walk up to the bar to settle up.. Dissapointing."}
{"text":"Best wings and burger in Charlotte. Do yourself a favor and try the BBQ wings,  you will not be disappointed. Nachos and steak and potato burrito are awesome as well.   Don't go in expecting anything fancy,  just really good food at decent prices.  Been going here for over 15 years."}
{"text":"their chargrilled wings are the best wings i've ever tasted.  this place has a fun atmosphere and really feels like everyone knows everyone.  we'll definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Best wings in Charlotte! Bee Stings and Uncle Donny's Blackened. My family eats dinner there almost every Friday night. It's a fun environment and Chef G-Man is the best! The homemade Smoked Tomato Vinaigrette dressing is fantastic too."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and had the Jalapeno bbq cheeseburger . Fantastic , probably the best burger I can remember having at a resteraunt as reasonably priced as the Moose.  Cole slaw was also perfect."}
{"text":"Cup of clam chowder was ok.  It tasted more like potato soup but it was good.  Left a weird gritty taste in my mouth.  Served with an abundance of saltines and oyster crackers on the side.   I also had an order of the killer bees wings (5) with ranch dressing . It came with two sad pieces of celery and carrots.  It was very tasty but also very spicy.  Good homemade ranch dressing. I would recommend trying the Bee Sting wings first to find out how spicy their wing sauces are before committing to the Killer Bees wings.   My dinner date had the chicken tenders with fries.  They were black on the outside and overcooked.  He was not a fan and probably won't have them again.   It's a dive bar on Montford drive with a small parking lot.  We parked across the street at he bowling alley.  Very loud, small bar but the staff was nice and service was fairly quick considering how busy they were.  I will be back to check out more flavors of the wings."}
{"text":"Good stuff. Great barbecue chicken. Close to home can make the meal fast. Kind of pricy."}
{"text":"Although we moved out to the Pacific Northwest,  I feequently recommend this restaurant to anyone I meet that is planning a visit to Charlotte, NC.    Rarely, does one happen across a restaurant that has moxy and to go a step further- finding an independent, family run establishment  that delivers good food consistently is the stuff dreams are made of.   The servers, cooks and bartenders at Moosehead are talented, funny, efficient and engaging while the owners (Allison and Chris)make you feel like you are a part of the family from the moment they meet you.   The food... oh the food! Whether your coming to check out the creative and well priced lunch specials during the week or coming to enjoy a delicious dinner or late night snack, Moosehead delivers time and time again. Their wing recipes are award winning  (seriously!) And from the first bite of a Donnie's blackened, you'll understand why. If I could give you a tip, it would be to ask for Donnie's blackened,  crispy.   If memory serves correct, the owner Chris was in the US Navy as a young adult- so all of these Internet trolls posting smack about Moosehead not supporting our servicemen and servicewomen is a bunch of crap. In fact, I seem to remember the nasty reviews revolving around one arrogant bonehead's poor choices which lead to a bad evening. When this charmer was called out, the Internet trolls banded together and left poor reviews right here on yelp to support their 'friend'. How sad!  In any event, try Moosehead for yourself and try it soon! Tell them Elissa sent you and if you have a chance, please tell Gman 'hello my friend'!"}
{"text":"Black bean and vegetable quesadilla was yummy, but pricing it the same as the seafood quesadilla?! No bueno. I wanted the seafood quesadilla too, but was told about 15 minutes after I placed the order that they weren't serving it. Lame. But the server was pretty funny, wanted to buy me a beer for my troubles, and my number. That transaction did not go down, but hilarity did ensue.   Onion rings were good and plentiful, and that philly steak burrito with mashed potatoes looked massive.  Great place for large groups of people to just hang out with a pitcher and some food. Service is spotty, but it is a busy bar. The double deck looks like it could be fun to hang out on and the moose head over the door staring at me as I eat was pretty cool."}
{"text":"This is a great dive bar/restaurant. Went there for the first time for lunch. Good patio, no/short wait.  I had the best French dip of my life there. Seriously, so amazing. Solidly good onion rings. My cousin had a good Greek salad with chicken- the dressing was fresh & so tasty. Possibly the best part? The staff. Fast, helpful, friendly. I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"Best dive bar in Charlotte. Good food and service, and best of all, great tunes playing all the time."}
{"text":"Look up the article in the newspaper about this place. Does not respect our disabled veterans AT ALL. Told veteran whose legs were blown off in Afghanistan to LEAVE. TRASH!"}
{"text":"Great locals spot. Good wings and a nice low key vibe. Not sure why if has 4 dollar signs, its most of  $ or $$ at most."}
{"text":"Second visit to Moosehead Grill... As everyone knows, hospitality is half the pleasure of dining out! Our waitress, Annette, was quite charming & attentive! We indulged in Western fries, smothered with melted cheese & crushed bacon. #Yum! We feasted on Pasta Rustica, which was very good and Nawlins Seafood Pasta that was very saucy, almost soupy, I was disappointed in that $15 dish. I don't mind paying for any food that's WORTH the money. After all, it was mostly pasta (one of the cheapest foods you can make!!) There were \"supposed to be scallops & shrimp in this dish, I counted 5 shrimp & barely detected ANY scallops. Their menu is vast, something for everyone. I'll be back, maybe I'll have better luck in choosing an entrée... #SatisfiedCustomer"}
{"text":"Moosehead is literally where my ego and my id go to get blacked out together. They have seen me celebrate and they've seen me wallow and Moosehead has welcomed me into their loving arms and poured me beers through all of it. I recommend grabbing a bourbon and exploring the many offerings of their juke and talking to strangers. Love you MH"}
{"text":"We got pick up and we weren't late, however, all food was soggy and steamed up. Fries were a huge let down, I was very excited for them to cure my pms rage craving. Almost warranted a phone call if I thought it would make any difference. Pork sandwiches were slightly fatty, and you ciabatta be kidding me with that bread, so fat n soggy!  charged a bunch for extras such as extra bbq sauce and cheese, and that Sam needed some extra SAWSE. Soup was good. Food would prob be better if ordered and eaten on site, however decor is pretty drab n depressing what with all the MOOSE HEADS on the wall (that's the name of the restaurant *-p.g.). With that being said, why have a drive up pick up service if there is not a way to maintain the integrity of the dish? Take care."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Nothing fancy.  They've got great wings and the staff is friendly.  Great beer selection, good music, and TVs visible from every seat.  What more do you need?"}
{"text":"One of the few OG dive bars left in Charlotte. Try to find better wings (I heard DD Peckers is good, but that's way too far away). Added bonus----G Man will sing happy birthday to you, even if it's not your birthday."}
{"text":"load up on some of uncle donnie's famous wings and, if you're feeling adventurous, some wasabi wings and experience the goodness that is moosehead"}
{"text":"I haven't been here too much late at night but I can only imagine it's always as great as the couple times I have been there.  But for lunch... WHAT A DEAL! Amazing food, great portions, and all for a great price.  Customer service is beyond amazing, great beer selection too.  Easily one of my favorite spots."}
{"text":"On a recent stop here, the service was lacking and the food seemed like standard bar food, or worse. I was disturbed when I saw the poor condition of the bathroom. I can only imagine what the condition of the kitchen was. I would not stop here again and I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Moosehead is like that childhood friend you're totally comfortable around. Or, those old jeans you probably should throw away but they're just so comfortable. Moosehead is comfortable. You can slide into a booth or up to the bar and feel at ease. There's almost always a game of some variety on. That is when RenElvis doesn't have the mic.   The food is ultimate comfort... Nachos, potato skins, wings. All super tasty! I wish they had a better beer selection. Their list is always pale, IPA, lager, etc. heavy, which isn't my cup of tea. But, regardless, I'll be back! It's just too comfortable to stay away."}
{"text":"The food has always been good here but the last time I went I couldn't get past how nasty the place was and looked.  I was afraid to touch anything."}
{"text":"Purchased the Pound Of Wings, with the container they were probably a pound. Still tasty tho. Did forget the celery but no biggie. Also Hot Fries were pretty decent. A lil kick to them. Overall, I would get take out again from there. Oh... Thought it was a lil pricey."}
{"text":"I believe this is an old Pizza Hut or something, as it has that feel to the place. So you'll get the sort of dive bar/restaurant feeling when you pull up & walk in, but it's a great little local place to eat.  First off, the menu isn't that extensive & you order off of a dry erase board at the front counter. Each meal on the board is a straight $8 for a combo...no more no less. It's actually kind of nice to give the man your money and only get bills back, no coins.  The food selection could be a little better, but the food I did get was pretty good. The fries were really good & take the cake on side items, with onion rings a close 2nd. If I weren't there for lunch, I probably would have gotten a couple of adult beverages. They have some good stuff on tap & I was really tempted to down a pint.  The staff here was very nice & I believe the owner was the guy taking orders at the front. It was good service & made you feel welcomed, even though he ragged us about sitting around so long, \"Don't you people have jobs?\"  The atmosphere is very welcoming, even with it feeling like I should have been eating the pizza buffet. There's a large moose head on the wall that I suppose gives the place its name. The signage isn't extensive so you'd pretty much have to know it was there to actually go there, but head over & try it out."}
{"text":"Ok food at good prices in good portions, but i love pub food and this just can t compare to my favorites."}
{"text":"A group of people I know ranted about the wings here saying they were a must try. So, my BF and I order some wings. The flavors were the PB and J, Bee Sting and the blackened wings. I wasn't sure what the PB and J would taste like but I was curious. They used some Thai flavoring to give it the taste. I could taste more PB than anything, I was waiting for the sweet taste but it never came. I would say try it. They weren't bad. The Bee Sting was good, the name is right it does stink a little but they were sweet. I was disappointed in the blackened as they were just down right spicy. i could not eat them. So if you don't like spicy don't get the blackened wings. We also order the original potatoes skins they were mediocre. All in all for a late night Saturday (10pm or so) meal, it hit the spot.   The decor in there is what kept my attention. You can stare all around the room and see different pictures or figurines. I would say its a good time after you had a few drinks. LOL"}
{"text":"The food is amazing. Don't order of the menu, but instead order of the chef's specials menu. Had the crabs cakes tonight which were accompanied by home made rice pilaf and sauted spinach. Everything was made to order and fresh."}
{"text":"Spicy honey wings? Yes, please.  Chicken tenders that are the size of my hands? Yes, please.  Nachos big enough to share with the table next to you? Yes, please.  Popcorn shrimp basket on Fridays during Lent? Yes, please.  Moosehead for lunch or dinner? Hell yes...please."}
{"text":"Best wings in the world, period. Great people, friendly vibe and good music too, which make the wings that much better. The bee sting wings are amazing, as are Donnie's blackened wings (cooked crispy). The rest of the menu is excellent, but if you consider yourself a wing connoisseur, you will find the best ever at Moosehead."}
{"text":"Want a place where everyone knows your name? A place where they won't ask your name? A place to pretend you are not even you? This is the spot. Convenient and a place with a lot of Charlotte character. Some people say there are many in Charlotte so enjoy a great bar/restaurant with atmosphere like Moosehead. Whether as a regular haunt or a place to get away you'll find this a fun satisfying spot to hang out. I love the people that work here, the atmosphere. The owners are nice and love the community. The food is really really good. You won't find better wings in Charlotte. No need to try. The Bee-sting and blackened are the best with just enough heat for those that like here but people who like more mild won't turn their noses up at them. But the PB&J wings are unique too. The nachos were amazing and they have great salads too if you have some sort of 2016 resolution you are trying to keep. And there are no calories in beer right?"}
{"text":"They serve food until 2am!!! Our sole purpose in stopping in was to grab food.   The parking lot is very odd and tiny. You will be very surprised if you get parking. We parked on the street.  Upon arriving we could hear the chatter and noise from inside outside.   Inside most of the booths were empty while the bar was packed.  We ordered wings and shooters. A lot of their wing flavors seem very spicy. So I chose the Meso Honey flavor. It was delicious. My friend had the original blackened  wings. I wanted to try the Kiss My Castmast shooter but they were out of some of the ingredients. So I chose a Absolut Gummy Bear shooter made with peach vodka. It wasn't good. Idk if it was because I substituted for another vodka flavor but I will never order that again.   All in all I'm glad to know that there is an option for late night eats in the Park Road area.

{"text":"After searching high and low for a sports bar that offered decent food, a friend recommended I check out Moosehead Grill.   Needless to say, I should just resign myself to eating fries, burgers, or nachos if I want to catch a game. The draft selection at Moosehead was pretty good, with lots of local representation. The nachos that I split with my boyfriend were yummy, but nothing to write home about.  The staff did put the sound on for the game (Duke vs UNC), which I appreciated even though it was hard to hear over the Friday night crowd. Next time if I'm looking for a sports scene, I'll just head to the nearest Wings and Beer chain - at least the viewing is good."}
{"text":"A great place to have a few beers with a group of people. Has a bit of a dive bar feel to it, has wooden booths and tables with outdoor seating, and has an upstairs seating area also. The service was just okay, but the food wasn't bad and the crowd was decent. We came here after a baseball game and ordered some pitchers of beer and were completely satisfied. Very mellow, casual place."}
{"text":"Definition of a dive bar at it's best. Great place to watch a game....be sure to have the bee stings wings!"}
{"text":"We had BBQ ribs with western sauce, baked sweet potato, smashed potatoes, veggies, 8oz sirloin steak and an order of onion rings.  Also had beer and a cocktail.  Price: fantastic.  All of the above was $50. Ribs were delectable, falling off the bone and were very meaty.  The sauce was one of the best BBQ sauces I've ever tasted, and they don't over-slather the meat.  Sweet potato was fresh, smashed potatoes and veggies were good. Steak was very delicious with no need for any sauces; it was cooked perfectly.  Onion rings were perfect. Cocktail was nice. Service was fantastic.  The only cons: they forgot to bring out the smashed potatoes, and there was very little parking."}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ ever!! Always fresh, delicious, and fast!! The decor is festive and rustic! Just like a great bbq place should be! The portions are huge with good prices!! The ribs are out of this world!! So tender and flavorful!! The western sauce is really good and smoky but all the sauces are house made and delicious!! They have awesome steaks as well!!    Highly recommend this place to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"Favorite local place for dinner. ALWAYS a good meal. Food is always great. Patio in the summer is awesome and they make some of the best ribs in the City. Only problem we've ever had here is slow service on the patio. Otherwise excellent all around!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars in CLT. Awesome bar food and awesome service. It's a hole in the wall type local place...so if that's not your cup of tea.........also..if you're a Panthers fan...go there to watch the game. I love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Uh, only three stars bc it was not a memorable place. Partially my fault (druuuunk) and partially their fault...just a bar.  They knew what a Chocolate Cake shot was, so they get points for that since places in Cali didn't know what they were.  Definitely worth a stop when you make the run through Montford watering holes.   dmo out"}
{"text":"This is your typical old school local bar and grill. Great location, staff, service, decor, value and appetizers. Can't go wrong with a single app on this list but the fried cheese and wings were my go too's. If you are looking for cold beer and some good food look no further."}
{"text":"Located in the shell of an old Pizza Hut, this place IS the wing station and even more! Genuine award winning wings are featured with teriffic flavor combos. ...try the mango/ghost pepper or the pb+j. Equally as good is the rest of the menu...1 lb meatloaf sandwich, generous rueben and home smoked pulled pork are worthy compliments to your favorite beverage flight be it beer or wine . Add the fresh side salad with a sprinkle of spinach and, homemade tomato balsamic, ...Better than soo many restaurants at twice the price. Please,  Don't miss the Moose when in Charlotte/ South Park!"}
{"text":"Only been in Charlotte for a year and I always hear people say \"It's a place on Montford\"....huh?  I don't know where that is.  So last night....we went to Montford.  So close and convenient to other bars and eateries around.  To me it reminds me of Lower Greenville in Dallas, Tx.  Loved it.  Mooseheads is a cool place where you can hang out with friends, and have a brew or two.  Or some wings.  Great prices, too!  Asked for a side of fries and I got a huge basket of fries for only $2.  Pitcher of beer was $10.  The place was pretty crowded and it was filled with mid 20's and 30's.  Just your typical bar hangout without the smoke.  Very clean!"}
{"text":"So I stopped by for lunch today. This little bar is neat! The food was good. The offered me a mint green tea with my meal. I got a shrimp po' boy and a salad. It's confusing when you walk in. I immediately ordered at the bar and the food was brought to my table. I don't think they have traditional wait service. The service was fast and friendly. I think they are known for wings. I'll give those a try when I go back."}
{"text":"The Mose is a great spot in South Park.  I'm a creature of habit and always get buffalo flavored wings everywhere, but with the crazy selection this place has I'm forced to mix it up.  The Honey Bee is my favorite which has a habenaro kick to it and I'm also a big fan of their blackened wings.  The bartenders and waitstaff are all really cool people.  Lori's been my server the last couple of times and she's awesome.  If you want some good wings and a tasty brew, then you've find your bar."}
{"text":"I like to consider myself a wing connoisseur. I am in the military and I travel a lot. These are the best wings I have had in my life!!!! The best food in town!!!! The bee stings and blackened wings are amazing. Lunch specials with great sides. I take all of my military buddies and business associates to tear place for lunch. The lunch menu is amazing!! The food is amazing and the owner is very personal. I am a regular and I am going to miss this place when I leave."}
{"text":"So the best wings in town is pushing it but they are definitely better than most wing places! I highly recommend their famous dry rub wings! I like how this place doesn't try hard to be anything but itself! It is small and just there but fun.   The decorations are very interesting and most important the service is definitely nice. I wish my food would have come a little faster but the fact that is was hot and tasty is good!   Oh yea the fries! How could I forget about their fries! They were so good and crispy . I would go back and order just the fries lol. It is worth the experience and a much better experience than hole in wall bars around Charlotte. Not hating on hole in the walls by the way!   Give it try I think you will enjoy the charm."}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ I have ever had, Steaks are to die for and reasonably priced, Pasta dishes and the Ruebens are amazing. Even the adult mac n cheese makes you want to be a kid again. Haven't had a bad dish on the menu! Staff are respectful and attentive and lastly the owner is approachable and very nice. Will continue to be a repeat customer for a long time!"}
{"text":"Don't come here. This is a locals joint and you'll ruin my chance to get to the bar. Been coming here for 15 years. Love it more than life itself.  If you don't like this place, fuck you."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place - Baja fish tacos (really a burrito) was amazing! So tasty. We also got the Donnie's wings and the hot habanero one. Both were really good. Service was ok - waitress forgot to put in another order of wings for us. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I'm writing an update to my first review. I've now had 4 different versions of their wings and had to raise my star count for them. They were seriously some great wings.   Service was still okay. The guy helped us out a good bit in the beginning making decisions but we were dry on drinks multiple times.   A waitress came around during the delivery and seemed somewhat mad that we asked the 50 wings split 4 ways?   Again the wings are incredible."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. I wasn't sure what to expect but was blown away by the wings. We had the Bee-sting wings which were appropriately spicy but not too hot. They were delicious accompanied by the fried mozzarella. A great lunch along with excellent service."}
{"text":"excellent lunch specials... always something new and delishious. wings are some of the best in charlotte"}
{"text":"Met some customers here for wings at lunch time.  A no frills place with limited variety.  Owner was friendly and involved... I liked that.  But the wings were just ok.  They were good mind you, but they were not above average.  Price was very nice... affordable."}
{"text":"my last night in Charlotte some coworkers and I decided to go to moose head for drinks. The night was going fine, loved the environment and we were having a good time.....until it was time for me to close out my tab. Now I work in the service industry so I understand and try to be patient with the bartenders/servers everywhere I go. I wish I could say the same for this guy \"jason\" behind the bar. It took this guy about 10 minutes to get me a pbr everytime I ordered (they were not very busy as it was after 12), and when I deceive to close out my tab at the end of the night, I was told that my debit card was Givin to the wrong guest and they had already left. Now I understand things can go wrong but the attitude I was Givin by this \"jason\" ensured I will never be back. I was not drunk (I had 2 beers because I had to drive) and I was treated with a \"not my problem\" attitude. When asking about my card I was told to calm down as if I where beligerent and out of control. When I asked what the guy could do for me he replied \"I'll take care of your 9 dollar tab\", and beyond that he told me there was nothing else that could be done. This was my first time and last time at Moosehead, and I'm sure it's a decent place when hipsters with a no care attitude aren't behind the bar."}
{"text":"Best wings in Charlotte (donnies/bee sting/chipotle bbq) and the specials are always good and are not generic dinners like other places. Great atmosphere as well"}
{"text":"Them wings boy. They spicy. Accidentally got some sauce in my eye and 'bout near lost the sucker! Good drink specials, went to a watch Panthers game there drank myself retarded and only spent $25.   Overall: A"}
{"text":"I've been to Moosehead many times, and haven't found a better place in Charlotte for bar food. they have great wings, burgers and nachos, as well as a good selection of beer. The atmosphere at Moose is great, with friendly patrons and bar staff."}
{"text":"The food here is so-so, not overly bad, yet nothing to rave about. We usually eat here when others want to, never our first choice. Most times the brisket is a tad dry, but liberally covered is sauce.  Their appetizers are fairly standard compared to other type places. The staff are typically friendly and happy to help as much as they can."}
{"text":"Great wings. Fun place. Larger portion size. Divey feel, but that is what you want from a place like this."}
{"text":"Wings are the bomb...a little chargrill. The Bee sting and Uncle Donnie's are what u want."}
{"text":"I challenge you to find a better dive bar in Charlotte. The following are reasons to come to Moosehead. 1. The wings are the best wings I have ever had. Trust me I am a wing afficianado. 2. G-man. If you've ever been here and he's been here you know what's up. He's a cook and he's insane but awesome. 3. The atmosphere is so chill. Everyone comes here and it's always a mix of people. Do yourself a flavor and pay them a visit."}
{"text":"So, I might have ventured into the Moosehead Grill after first frequenting a few of the other bars on Montford, so this review might be totally wrong... Buuut... YUM! The wings were meaty and spicy, the queso was satisfying and the beer was super cold and fabulously priced. Although it was a bit chilly out, there were still tons of people out on the patio. The crows was very laid-back and I would have no problem going for some late night wings in jeans and a t-shirt. Great place. Definitely a must-try for anyone living in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Wow!!! First time here, drove by and thought we would try it. Great service! Great food!! They are famous for their wings......which were FABULOUS!!! And.....the turkey cranberry club was the best sandwich I have ever had!!! It was PERFECT!! Beer was cold, staff were super friendly. Excited to come here again!!"}
{"text":"Food is spot on 95% of the time. It's the service that really gets under my skin. Sometimes it's decent, most of the time it flat out sucks. I've never seen a bartender so pissed off to pour a beer when asked... What's your deal dude? Don't like taking my money?  Either way, the have some of the best wings in town. Blackened or the Bee Stings are my go-to.   I'm not normally one for fried cheese but their friend pepper jack is worth the horrible calories."}
{"text":"Super cool place for a late night meal and a few drinks. The Bayou Burger was AMAZING. Whoever thought to put andouille sausage on a burger is legit brilliant!! I will come back for that one, most definitely.   Even on a busy Friday evening, we received quick service. We even helped wish a fellow patron a happy birthday (seriously, everyone in the restaurant sung along )."}
