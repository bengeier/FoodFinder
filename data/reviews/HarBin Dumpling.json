{"text":"Dumplings are a 5 star, but their noodles are a 0 star.  Finally tried their noodles after going there for dumplings on several occasions, and in short, they were salty as salty gets, plus very oily, like noodles swimming in oil."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Nice employees, nice food, fast, cheap and it's peanut free. I can't recommend this place enough.

Je regrette de n'avoir jamais arrêté a ce restaurant plus tôt. La nourriture est tout simplement délicieuse, les employés sont sympathiques. C'est également rapide, vraiment pas cher, et l'établissement est sans arachides."}
{"text":"bummer. and here i was really wanting to like this place. 

but a fried eggplant appetizer consisting of two raw slices of eggplant with ground, unseasoned pork sandwiched between 'em, dipped in gluey tempura and fried, a chinese-style-fried-eggplant-dish does not make. very underwhelming way to kick things off. 

the pork and chive dumplings-- were alright. a little too big, and a little too doughy, truth be told. the veggie (tofu) dumplings-- were no good, and actually watery (to the point where I'm guessing they hadn't squeezed out the excess moisture from the tofu in making the mixture). nor did they actually'taste' like anything... making up for it were the standard vinegar, soy sauce, chili oil (though mostly chili oil and not much chili) accoutrements.  

to top it all off, the younger girl working behind the bar and serving most of the tables was doing her best surly-old-backstreets-of-harbin-chinese-dumpling-lady-impression which was met with confusion on behalf of most diners there who just seemed to find her plain rude. us included.

next time, to satiate a dumpling craving north of the mountain, for 1/4 of the price, id make my way up to Jean Talon & Saint Denis to buy dumplings from the corner grocer and make em myself at home. or head south to qing hua or sammi and soupe-- the latter serving the best xiao laong bao i have had in canada.

too bad harbin dumplings, could'a had something here..."}
{"text":"La soupe aigre douce est délicieuse et bien relevée! Nous avons testé les dumplings frits (crevette/porc/coridandre) et à la vapeur (poulet/champi). Ils étaient bons, la coriandre et les crevettes n'étaient pas assez prononcés à mon goût. Service très cordiale et cuisine ouverte : j'adore! Le prix est très abordable! J'aurais aimé un choix de sauce pour les dumplings..."}
{"text":"Do my eyes deceive me or is there a dumpling place in the mile-end? You read it right, sweet reader, chinese dumplings all up in the mile-end! It is a pleasant stop between two other favs -- casa del popolo and aux vivres -- now you can watch a show, eat dumplings and then hit aux vivres for some vegan goodness on your way back to the plateau. How perfect is that?

We had the pork + chive dumplings and the tofu + veg (steamed). Both were on point! We also had the edamame to start.... it was super overdone somehow but i am reserving judgement until i see more edamame reviews. let's hear 'em. 

Good dumplings! Mile-end! Yay!"}
{"text":"We've been 3 times in two weeks since we discovered this place in our neighbourhood. Fantastic! Amazing good, kind and attentive servers. I prefer steamed over fried dumplings, but everything so far has been delicious."}
{"text":"Had a good meal a few months back, but seems lately the service and quality are on the decline. We had to constantly ask for service, which was annoying as we were at the bar. We were served our plates,  no one checked to see how we were doing,  and the dumplings dough was raw. When I told the server she just smiled and said she'd tell the kitchen. Useless."}
{"text":"Literally the worst service I had in my life. Could not get seated even after being told in 10minutes we'd have a table. Don't expect to get in here"}
{"text":"Très bon, pas cher, le service et agréable, c'est un bel endroit décoré avec goût et intelligence.
Une cuisine familiale de qualité.
Rien à redire !"}
{"text":"The decor is good and dumplings are pretty authentic (kind of rare to have good decor in Chinese places). Prices are comparable to Chinatown ($8 for pork, $9-$`0 for beef, $11 for lamb). I'm glad I don't have to walk all the way to Guy-Concordia or Chinatown for dumplings! Good vegetarian options too."}
{"text":"I ordered the fried dumplings. They were gushing with oil and very unpleasant to eat. The owner said they're supposed to taste like that, even though this has never been my experience with fried dumplings in the past. Disappointing since there is a $1.50 charge for having them fried as well. 

The waitress was very kind, quick to refill water, and fluent in both English and French. 

If you go to this restaurant, avoid anything fried."}
{"text":"Des dumpings sur le plateau: génial! Nous avons commandé des dumpings au porc et aux crevettes. Il étaient très bons. Nous avons aussi commandé des fèves edames. Elles étaient \"fraichement dégelées/encore gelées\" c'était décevant. J'espère qu'ils auront bientôt leur permis d'alcool ou que ce sera un \"apportez votre vin\". Endroit très sympathique et service rapide."}
{"text":"Very welcome addition to the dumpling and generally Asian good starved neighbourhood of the Plateau Mont-Royal. Solid meat and vegetarian handmade dumplings. I would avoid the spring rolls and  soups and focus on the dumplings as this is where Harbin shines."}
{"text":"Un des meilleurs endroits pour goûter d'excellents dumplings à Montréal. Nous avons commandé pour emporter et les dumplings étaient très bons et chauds."}
{"text":"Staff was really nice to us despite the room being pack to the gils. Food was underwhelming and choice is very limited. Overall filling was bland and under seasoned. The only hot sauce they offer is a tasteless red-ish oil. The broth isn't even home made, they use instant powder soup base - the same generic packets you find in grocery stores"}
{"text":"Dumplings were ok. My boyfriend hated it. It was 10$ for 12 dumplings. You could tell they were frozen. We were the only people in there except for six employees eating at another table none of who asked if I wanted A refill on my beer, I did. I felt like we were somehow bothering all of them by eating there. In my boyfriends words, \" it was not shitty, but close to it\""}
{"text":"Si ma mère avait été chinoise, j'eus souhaité qu'elle me prépare une soupe aigre piquante comme celle servie ici. Bien relevée, servie dans une grande tasse, légumes encore légèrement croquants, un régal. Comme plat, dumpings porc et coriandre bouillis. Je reçois une généreuse portion. La pâte est mince, le tout est goûteux à souhait mais n'est pas à l'égal de chinoiserie & dumpings qui, à ce jour, demeure mon refuge favoris pour ce type de repas. On y passe pour manger en vitesse ou pour retrouver des amis. Un gros bémol, la caissière derrière le comptoir baille à plein visage et semble plus occupé à jouer sur son cell qu'à servir ses clients. La note peu salée 13$ m'a toutefois consolé!"}
{"text":"Dumpling overload! Thankfully we were in the mood for dumplings. :-). Staff is nice and efficient. The chicken curry dumplings are awesome! Will definitely go back when i feel like kung fu panda"}
{"text":"I wish I could take away this last star. Called ahead so we could get a table for four. Once we showed up, we were told to wait 10 minutes. After that, we were told we couldn't have a table. Mind you, other groups of two got a seat right away, and that free table for four was kept empty the whole time. 

This is the second time I try to eat here and get treated terribly. Good luck keeping your customers. The food is good, but the service remains trash."}
{"text":"Really great dumplings!! Comparable to Qing Hua. Service is on the slow side, but the food is good and amazing for the price."}
{"text":"LOVE IT.

Delicious dumplings and super friendly service :) I saw a lot of complaints about the slow service, but it's to be expected of a place that's newly open and increasing in popularity.

They have an ad up for more help, so I assume the wait time during peak periods will improve.

BETTER THAN QING HUA. Plus the place is bright, comfortable and clean.

Try the beef curry dumplings, you wont be disappointed. 

We also grabbed some pork/bok choi dumplings as well and some spring rolls. 

Everything was delicious, fresh and expertly prepared. Even the spring rolls were impressive, not greasy, fried crispy and delicious!"}
{"text":"Definitely in the top 5 dumplings in Montreal. They have unique flavors like red curry chicken. Yummy"}
{"text":"When I first started going here it was a new unknown spot and it quickly has become a wait outside in the winter on a week day just for a seat place! Yes, expect to wait a bit if you go at a popular time but it's well worth it. Dumplings are made by hand when you order them, good variety and nice owner and staff. My favorite are the steamed dumplings with pork, shrimp and green onion, there's a whole shrimp in it!"}
{"text":"The best dumplings place I know outside of Chinatown. These are bigger dumplings with thicker edges which remind me a bit of the Georgian Hinkaly.  This place is great for lunch. It gets full fast,  you might have to share a communal table but the service is quick. The soups are pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Nothing that really blows my mind.

First off, it's pretty clean compared to a lot of the dumpling places in Chinatown, but that's probably because it opened not too long ago. I quite like the TV on the wall behind the bar that's playing what seems like \"The Taste of China,\" which I find complimentary to the food. 

In terms of dumplings, I can't really tell whether the dumpling skins are handmade based on the texture. Nonetheless, I found the dumplings to be quite average. They're served in four different ways: boiled, steamed, soup, and fried (extra $$ for the fried ones from what I remember). The soup dumplings are served in chicken broth, which I find light and warming on a cold day. Paired with a pot of jasmine tea, it's not so bad for a quick hearty dinner.

Overall not a bad choice if you want dumplings in the plateau."}
{"text":"Brutal service. Waitress didn't put in our order and didn't bother telling us so an hour and a half after we ordered we didn't have any food while tables that showed up after us had left. Then our waitress went home. Then someone came to apologize and tell us our food would be out in 10 minutes. 20 minutes later they gave us our food with one of the dishes wrong. Then they started turning off the lights while we were finishing up because they were closing even though the only reason we were still there was because the food took so long to get to us. 
That said...delicious dumplings."}
{"text":"Lets say this is really 2 1/2.  I had high hopes for this place and maybe I just got a bad day as I went for lunch and maybe that was the issue.  We got the pork and chive and the curry beef dumplings.  The pork and chive have an excellent filling and the reason I'm tempted to go with three stars.  But the problem is that the fried versions had a problem.  The wrapper tasted and felt like it was under done.  Maybe this wrapper is made more for steaming or something odd went on, but the first few were like this.  The curry ones were not that great as well.  So while a nice price and a good deal, under done wrapper just doesn't cut it.  I hope this was just a one off, and judging from other posts it probably was, but at the end of the lunch i had \"experienced better\" so that works out to be two stars.  Maybe three because of the good filling on the pork ones.  Service was good and we probably should have sent things back."}
{"text":"The dumplings were delicious, but the service was very bad, even though the waiter was friendly. It took about 1 hour to get our first plate of fried dumplings (beef & coriander - they were actually super good) and there was only about 3-4 others tables at the time. When the plate arrive, I had to get up myself to go grab nakpins, plates and little bowls for the sauce. The waiter explained then they had lots of take-outs, and then another 20 minutes for our second steam dumplings plate."}
{"text":"Hard to get a seat here sometimes but delicious dumplings with a good price to quality ratio. Highly recommend the beef curry."}
{"text":"We were three and shared a few plates, we had steamed chicken & coriander, steamed red curry beef, fried porc & chive and beef & onion in broth.
All were pretty good, with a special mention for the chicken & coriander which won everyone's vote and we ended up ordering another plate.
The real problem was the service, extremely slow and clunky (the waitress kept forgetting things, we were served soup but never got any spoon throughout the entire meal, we ordered tea which took more than 30 minutes to come..).
Don't go there if you have limited time for your meal!
Also, we ordered Edamame to have something to eat while we were waiting (forever) for our dumplings and those came super quick.. which is probably explained by the fact that they were served cold and you could really tell they had been cooked a while ago in a big batch which made them kind of mushy."}
{"text":"My friend insisted to have me try this place and I should thank her. 
While I must say that the decor and ambiance are not the greatest, the place is clean and service is good. All of this being better than any Chinese village restaurant I visited. I would suggest this place for a quick lunch but maybe not for a date. 

We were seated at the bar immediately when we walked in. 

We order pan fried lamb and chives dumplings and steamed beef and curry ones. Both were excellent. The dumplings are very juicy and you should be careful as they arrive hot as hell. 
They have different types of Sake served hot or cold. 
2 dumplings orders, sake and beer cost a total of $44 plus tip. 

I will definitely go again and try different dumpling flavours."}
{"text":"This restaurant was really delicious. The food all tasted really good, although it got cold really fast. We were also sitting next to the door and during the winter months of course this got very cold! Would definitely come back though."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go out of my way for these dumplings, like if you are a dumpling nerd on a dumpling crawl and you're down to your last hour, or last plate of dumplings ever, maybe this wouldn't be my choice for you... but there exists a time and a place where I am in fact a fan. Like for example Tuesday when I was enjoying the weather and walking up to Little Italy from McGill, and needed to sit and refuel somewhere. On that day the yellow mellow friendly vibe of this place, hopping with clients but in like a chill way, and the plate of fried dumplings laid out before me in all their glory were heroic and exactly what was called for. 

The skins are a little thick, and the filling in my beef and curry was juicy but not quite as tender as at my favourite spots in the world, but the flavour was great and in general tasted fresh. The service was perfect, friendly and welcoming, and left me with good vibes that pushed my stars from 3 to 4 when I remembered all their smiles."}
{"text":"Selon moi, inutile pour vous de vous déplacer à Chinatown pour de bons dumplings. Harbin sert d'excellents dumplings! Et je vous jure que mon opinion n'est pas biaisée dû au fait que j'habite proche. 

J'aime partager une variété entre amis - porc, buf, crevette, et d'en prendre certains frits et d'autres cuits vapeur. Peu importe le choix, ils sont goûteux et pas dispendieux."}
{"text":"J'ai eu l'occasion de tester il y a quelques temps déjà et je ne connaissais pas du tout ce type de plat. 

J'ai trouvé le cadre sympa mais il y avait vraiment trop de monde et c'était très bruyant. Par contre coté nourriture c'était prêt rapidement et le gout était bon. J'ai mangé mieux depuis mais je trouve que c'est correct. Le choix est relativement important en plus de cela.

Un bon endroit pour manger rapidement et correctement"}
{"text":"The standard for decor and atmosphere for Montreal dumpling places is unfortunately low. HarBin shines out as a beacon within a land of despair with its stylish and cool interior. 

The service was quick and the waitress gave us great recommendations. The dumpling skins were soft, flavourful and the perfect thickness. My advice to vegetarians is go for the tofu&veggie dumplings! They were much better than the egg&chive. The pork & coriander dumplings were also a hit. The only bummer was that the filling in all the dumplings we got were slightly soggy so water started sogging out by the last few dumplings. 

Polish off the whole experience with a pot of jasmine tea. It's the best remedy for a cold winter ; dumplings and freshly brewed tea."}
{"text":"Thank goodness today's weather was amazing, because this restaurant is approximately 10 minutes of walk from the metro, Laurier station on the orange line. Once you go inside, you'll notice that the place isn't huge. In fact, I felt quite cozy in there. The menu shows us that the dumplings can be cooked in 4 different ways: steamed, grilled or boiled (forgot the fourth option) and the choices are quite simple. I took pork and coriander steamed dumplings. Although the service was longer than expected, the overall experience was very good. Would go back"}
{"text":"The dumplings were amazing especially outside of Chinatown and new Chinatown. Four types, steamed, boiled, fried and in soup. Really tasty. But the service is not very good. They seem to still be working out that part. If you are prepared for service arguably worst than Chinatown then go for it."}
{"text":"Amazing meal; the service was friendly, the food was delicious and the cooking show on the TV was surprisingly enjoyable. This is my new favorite dumpling place."}
{"text":"For some reason I don't get the opportunity to eat Chinese food as much as I used to so I welcomed an opportunity to meet some friends for lunch here the other day.  HarBin Dumplings is a small, casual eatery and the decor and ambiance is rather bare and simple.  It's fine though when all you want is a relaxed meal in a casual setting.

We started off with some miso soup and it was okay.  It was a bit watered down and could have done with a little more seasoning.  I followed that up with spring rolls which I thoroughly enjoyed.  They were very crispy and well-seasoned.  Sadly though, things went downhill again with the dumplings.  My order of steamed dumplings weren't terrible but they didn't really blow me away.  I ordered the pork and cabbage and beef and coriander ones.  Both were kind of lacking in flavour.  Like the miso soup they were okay but nothing spectacular.

Service was quick and at $20 (tip included) the price was right.  HarBin is one of those places you come to if you are in the area but it really isn't worth a detour.  The experience here is enjoyable but there is room for improvement."}
{"text":"This is not the best dumplings in Montreal, there are definitely better places out there. Yet, I find this cute little resto quite charming. Their squid dumplings are not as great, but the lamb dumplings are quite good. The service is quick and friendly, and you get to see how the food is prepared, which is always a plus. The prices are pretty good too, so you won't break your budget. When I'm too lazy to go to Chinatown, I'd definitely consider going back to this place."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really small and the ambiance is ok. Also the chair aren't really confortable (more like stool). But the dumpling are really good ! We tried fry and steam with different combinations of chicken, pork and veggies. The person who serve us was really nice and is was fast. I would recommand to go to this place at noon for a quick break from walking St-Laurent."}
{"text":"I have been here 5-6 times and it never disappoints! At this little cosy and well-decorated restaurant, they do hand-made dumplings with high-quality lamb and seafood that you can really feel in each bite at $9-12 per plate. After spending $15/person sharing 4 plates with 3 friends, I have sufficient amount of lamb, shrimp, pork, shitake mushroom, green veggie in my happy belly. Meanwhile, the server continuously comes to refill my tea with a big smile ... Meanwhile, you probably can't even get a \"avocado toast/quinoa salad\" at a hipster brunch place at the same price nearby. Hence, my 5 star, to honour those hard-working dumpling making heroes in the jungle of hipster plateau ;)"}
