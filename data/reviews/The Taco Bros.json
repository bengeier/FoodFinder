{"text":"These guys were amazing. They were so accommodating to me being a vegetarian, and he gave me tacos instead of a burrito cause he said it would taste better. What cool guys!"}
{"text":"Customer service was great!! The people working were friendly and accommodating. I was surprised by how good (and fresh) the tacos were! We had the carne asada and carnitas with beans and rice. The portions were large, too. Most places give you three small tacos, so I ordered three, but could only eat two because they were big. Also, the place is CLEAN and inviting unlike the previous taco shop. I'm not a fan of their chips, but the guacamole is amazing. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times & have always had awesome food! Everything is homemade. The queso & guacamole are amazing! We lived 50 min away & will keep coming back for more!"}
{"text":"SOO GOOD.   I got three beef tacos and it came with free rice & beans and they were the best tacos i've had in madison. This is the closest I've gotten to authentic street style tacos in the Midwest and am definitely coming back. They just started a new deal with Eat Street so I got 3 tacos for $4.99 which was awesome (you have to order it through the website though).   My friend got the plain tacos and they tasted phenomenal as well! They come with guac and with homemade chips, it's just so good.   They're a newish place so i'm sure they'll fix a few kinks (they did get reusable plates for eating in!) but definitely much better than what used to be there."}
{"text":"The staff is wonderful and friendly, I immediately hoped the food would deliver and it did. Delicious, cheap, and filling. I don't tend to like refried beans and I love theirs. I'll be happily having leftovers for dinner tonight."}
{"text":"Craving a burrito, I decided to forgo Chipotle and check out Taco Bros. The proprietor was very welcoming, and overall service was 5 stars. Got the jerk chicken burrito. It was fabulous. A little pricey at $9.50, so not something I would get too frequently, but I'll probably be back."}
{"text":"We found Taco Bros on a whim and we're so glad we did.  Logan, the owner was the sole host/cashier/chef/server/entertainment that night. We ordered the beef, chicken, and chorizo tacos. When you order 3 tacos, you get rice and beans for sides. We also ordered half and half of the beef and pork burrito. Having a dairy allergy, Logan assured us that our order would be completely dairy-free.   They were out of the carne asada, and the BLT taco was still being braised and would be a two hour wait. Lucky to those who came in two hours after us.  We were notified that if we decide to eat in, we'd get complimentary chips and salsa, so of course we decided to stay and eat.  Logan quickly brought out a jug of ice water with sliced lime - a nice touch, refreshing on such a warm, swampy day.  The chips are made in house and arrived crispy and hot. It came with two salsas, a red and green, both refreshing and not too spicy.  The tacos and burrito arrived a short time later. We tried the chorizo first, wow! This is not your typical chorizo, it's taken out of the casing, then finely diced. It had such complex flavor and was easily our favorite. The beef and chicken tacos are served 'dry' style, without sauce, but that doesn't mean without flavor. You can taste the hours and passion that went into these meats, it didn't need a touch of salsa or hot sauce - they are just that good! Each of these tacos came with a generous slice of avocado and their own custom garnish; the beef taco had thin slices of delightfully pink pickled radish.   The burrito was easily the size of my 8 inch plate. It was filled with meats, shredded romaine lettuce, beans, rice, and avocado. I couldn't even finish half of it.  Later Logan explained that he and his business partner also have a farm where all the meats in the restaurant come from. If they are unable to get a particular cut, they find the meat from farms within a 40 mile radius.  I can truly appreciate the love and dedication Logan puts into his food and the restaurant. The shop has a laid-back, SoCal feel with cool recycled, brightly colored wooden boards, and a surf board against the accent wall.  We'll definitely be back again soon.  They also offer catering!"}
{"text":"Fantastic tacos, best tacos in Madison. Tacos have a blend of flavors, doubled up toasted corn tortilla, tangy guac, and the meat is plenty and flavorful. The owners are extremely friendly and make sure that the food is great. Also, the chorizo tacos are currently my favorite on the menu. They make the chorizo in house, versus using a dried up sausage. Everything is fresh and high quality. If you haven't been here yet, you gotta try it out."}
{"text":"It's all about the Carne Asada. So juicy and tasty and the cheese these guys are using is very authentic and yummy. I also really loved the touch of Ranchero sauce on top. I have been one other time and gotten three tacos a la carte. The Jerk Chicken was my favorite of the three but I will definitely be back to try them all (chorizo, carnitas, all the great flavors are represented and done very well!) Did I mention homemade Churros? I've never had them so crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. Here's to great Mexican done right in downtown Madison!"}
{"text":"Carne Asada chimi with rice and beans was great.  Quality ingredients and very flavorful!  I was surprised that it wasn't packed out since the food was so good.  I guess the place is new.  The homemade salsa and chips were s nice touch too.  I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Saw a review and dropped in. Pretty solid Chimichanga! Carne Asada Chimi was great. Make sure you stop in. Folks working here are great."}
{"text":"A few days ago I was walking to Bob's copy shop and was looking for a quick lunch spot, this was an amazing choice!  Apparently the new owners picked up a taco restaurant that failed miserably... This place will be here to stay because of their great selection, incredible tacos, and prime location for the drinkers of the town.    Tonight I came here with my girlfriend because we have been desperately seeking good quick Mexican food in Madison for years - we have finally found the perfect place!  Tacos with such great flavor that overeating is an assured fate...  Buy 3 tacos get beans and rice for free - three tacos with beans and rice will feed two people, probably get a fourth taco though if sharing.  Great sauces, especially the quote warm avocado jalape√±o salsa verde!  The veggie taco is a bit spicy - and I told them to never tone it down because the flavor is great; be warned though... Three veggie tacos would light most people up.  Can't wait to come here again!"}
{"text":"Went here when it first opened. Although I want to give it the benefit of the doubt (has a cute, beachy atmosphere), I wasn't really a fan of the food. I think as this business grows its customer base and curtails towards their taste, it will become better."}
{"text":"This is the worst customer service I've ever had. The girl at the cashier was texting and we had to get her attention and the guys behind the counter were swearing and complaining about other customers the entire time. That being said, the tacos were great. I miss you, taco shop."}
{"text":"Any restaurant that uses Calvin and Hobbes cartoons as advertisements gets my vote initially. Additionally, any restaurant that serves nachos literally (and metaphorically) flowing over the plate gets my vote as well. Growing up eating Mexican food and reading Calvin and Hobbes cartoons, I felt right at home. Well played, Taco Bros.   Plus they have dynamite salsa! (dynamite = good)"}
{"text":"Food was amazing, service was great, always been a great experience. We've eaten there 8-10 times. Ignore the poor reviews, drunk college students in Madison.... This place is AWESOME!"}
{"text":"I guess that before this place opened it was another taco place that wasn't that good. NOT THE SAME PLACE.  I stumbled upon this place  at the end of a run through Madison, and went inside to check it out.  It was a great find, and easily the best burrito I have ever had (braised beef burrito- wet).   Everything is made in house and is farm to table. They process their own meat and grow their own vegetables. I came back with my wife, and she loved the veggie chimichanga. Fresh kale, pickled radish, it's really an amazing meal. Make sure to get house made chips and guacamole, queso or salsa.   I highly recommend this place, bring your appetite and don't miss out!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty affordable and the location is great. I've had nachos and tacos here and both were pretty good. This place is always empty when I'm here though and I'm wondering if it will survive. Hoping it will!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I've been here twice, with slightly conflicting results. First time was superfab, the second time was pretty good. I think the difference was lunch & dinner? Maybe?  First time was with a friend from my workplace during lunch. She got the taco salad, I got the grilled veggie wet burrito. fjadklfjafa;sl. The sauces on that burrito. Dayum. Halley also couldn't stop talking about her taco salad and how good it was, except when she was eating it. Then I had the most heavenly experience when I got their Mexican cruller, or basically kind of a smashed churro, fried & with sugar & cinnamon. I wanted like, 10 of these.  We had a great time talking to the two owners. So much so that my friend asked about catering for her wedding! (they can do it!!)  So the next time I went was with my husband Derek. We went pretty late, and instead of the two owners there it was one of the owners and two new-looking guys who seemed a little lost. Derek liked his 3 tacos well-enough, but said the meat was pretty dry (while Halley said the meat melted in her mouth). I got a grilled veggie taco salad. The grilled veggies were amazeballs and overall it was pretty good. We were both really disappointed by the chips & guac -- stale chips, and then two small plastic cups of guac ... one of which was basically a jalapeno puree, and not what I wanted at all.  Hoping the third time comes back to SUPERFAB.  Lastly, one of the biggest things keeping me from 5 stars ... everything is disposable: paper plates, plastic cups for water and for sides, paper plates, aluminum containers, etc. Not impressed. (NOTE: Jaime, one of the really nice owners, contacted me and said that at the moment, they're using disposable gear at night due to the drunk campus atmosphere. The late night crowd is a bit different than the lunch crowd. Makes sense, so drunk people: save your planet and stop taking stuff!)"}
{"text":"This was EXCELLENT. I went looking for the taco place that formerly had been here, and was delighted to find Taco Bros there instead. The people working there, in particular the owner, are great, friendly, courteous. Prices are reasonable for downtown and for the extremely high quality of food that you get. I am so impressed with the dinner I had--it was delicious. I did the \"buy three tacos, get free beans and rice\" deal and for $10 it was more than enough food for dinner for one--I have a taco leftover that I'm not sure I can handle. The ingredients are all obviously high quality and fresh. The beans and rice were great, notable in themselves (which is unusual for Mexican, I think). I had both chorizo and braised beef tacos, and I strongly prefer the chorizo, though the beef is also very good (the chorizo is also fifty cents more a taco... worth it, IMO).   I will be going back, many times."}
{"text":"My buddy and I have been at a conference at the Fluno Center from August 10-14.  Mon, tuesday of that week I went across the street to the Taco Bros at 12pm to try their tacos.  Each day their door was locked. I didn't understand because their hours clearly stated open at 11 daily. On wednesday I was excited to get some tacos because I saw someone had wrote a new review on that location on Monday August 10, and gave it 4-5 stars.  I gave the taco shop the benefit of the doubt thinking maybe their was an emergency or whatever.  On their website they seem to really enjoy making So Cal tacos and seemed like experienced guys who were proud of the food they served.  I decided to return.  It wasn't a big deal because it was right across the street.  The door was still locked and the lights off.  The hours of the door clearly state open daily at 11am.  My buddy went to the hairstylist next door to ask what's up with the Taco Bros and they said \"No I don't think their closed but they are not open very often\"  What's up with that? What sucks is that according to Yelp, there are no other 4-5 star taco joints downtown Madison.   I am pretty sure I got the right location, the location was cross referenced on google, yelp, apple maps and their website and confirmed by the hairstylist.    Sincerely, Hard up for some tacos in Madison."}
