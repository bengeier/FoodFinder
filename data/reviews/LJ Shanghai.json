{"text":"Yay!  Soup dumplings in Cleveland.  Xiolongbao, fresh and handmade?  Here?  YesYesYes and so many thank you's."}
{"text":"Best xiao long bao I've had in a while. As someone who has lived in Hong Kong and LA, I can safely say that these xlb are comparable to DTF. The beef noodle soup can be a bit spicy but I'm sure you can ask for mild or something. The noodles are chewy and beef tender, just the way it should be! My friend ordered the Pan Fried noodles and it comes with some veggies and pork. I had a taste, or maybe several to be exact, and it was delicious.  The most recent time I came here I got the salted veggie and pork noodle soup. It was decent and much easier on the stomach if spicy isn't your thing. I will be coming here often!"}
{"text":"Finally genuine Shanghai cuisine in Cleveland!  We use to travel to Toronto to get this and now we finally have this gem here.  The noodles are fresh and DELICIOUS! The spicy beef noodle soup and Shanghai stir fried noodles are amazing.  The Xiao Long Bao is perfection! I appreciate the limited menu because that means these items have been perfected instead of being inundated with too many options that are being made mediocre.  So far we have been here once a week and it hits the spot each time!"}
{"text":"Great service! We came here specifically for the soup dumplings, which were worth the trip. We also had spicy beef noodles/ shredded pork and salty broth/ edamame/ shrimp pork dumplings/ and veggie noodle soup/ spring rolls. One minor issue with presentation that was quickly taken care of by the owner. All food was delicious, priced fairly and we would definitely recommend to others. Including a selfie with the owner LJ who is so friendly/nice/present !!"}
{"text":"LJ Shanghai is a great addition to the food scene in Asia town.  While the menu is quite limited,  the offerings are different from other restaurants in the area.   They specialize in handmade dumplings and steamed buns.  They even have a window into part of the kitchen to let you see the dumplings being made.    We tried the xiao long bao and the spicy beef noodle soup.  Both were very good.  We also tried the edamame and steamed vegetable buns.  Those were average."}
{"text":"Pork xiao long bao was good spicy noodles and shanghai noodles good Vibe and presentation good Spicy cucumber was poor  Overall similar to experiences that I've had in NYC. Glad there's a place like this in the Land"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to LJ Shanghai last night for the first time. We love xiaolongbao, and was excited to find it in Cleveland. They are delicate little things, and the soup inside was tremendous. The eggrolls are by far the freshest we've ever tried, and the flavor pops in your mouth from the shrimp. It's nice to have an authentic Shanghai restaurant in town!"}
{"text":"This place has some real good food. Spicy beef tripe (#9) and soup dumplings (#1) are the must. The meat in the noodle soups were very tender and deep in flavor.  Went with friends and had to come back again to try the other menus. The service was awesome too. I wish they served beer and baijiu as the beef tripe would be a great beer snack food."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! We ordered the pan fried noodles and wonton soup with the dumplings. The dumplings were so delicious and the star of the show. We loved everything we ordered so much that we took extra home with us. Extraordinary food and service here. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Delicious soup dumplings in Cleveland!   This new restaurant is a cozy and fresh addition to the line of pho restaurants that outline Superior Road. If your taste buds are craving something flavorful and spicy, there are plenty of Chong Qing (??) style dishes to fit your needs, particularly noodle soups filled with various meats and delicacies (beef, pig intestines, etc.). No matter what dishes you order, make sure to get plenty of orders of the house specialty Soup dumpling (????). This is certainly a real toasty treat in the cold winter months in Cleveland and very well made here. At 6 dumplings per bamboo bin, and $5 per bin, you just really can't get a better deal on something so delicious right here in Believeland. Will certainly be returning here for more dumplings as well as the expanded menu options - set to happen sometime next month, can't wait!"}
{"text":"Before the sudden appearance of LJ Shanghai on Cleveland's east side, there was a very noticeable gap in the xiaolongbao market - very few, if any, Chinese restaurants in Cleveland offer them on their menu. When we heard about a new Chinese restaurant that serves xiaolongbao, we obviously had to investigate!  We went upon hearing a lot of hype about the delicious food and affordable price (as poor graduate/professional students, the $5 for 5 xiaolongbao definitely sealed the deal). We were seated almost immediately, but the table space is definitely cramped and we felt like we were smashed up against the party of 3 next to us! They do not serve tea by default, but you can order by request. It's definitely a no-frills restaurant, but the modern interior with bright colors and plenty of lighting was a breath of fresh air from other, stuffier restaurants in the immediate Asiatown area. Service was a bit slow, but nothing dramatic especially since they were quite busy at the time.   We ordered two orders of the xiaolongbao, one spicy beef noodle, and one pork noodle. I would say that the inexpensive price per dumpling is accurate... they were not that great. After eating about 3 each, we became pretty uninterested. The dumplings themselves were quite doughy and the filling was nothing special - if the West Coast's Din Tai Fung is 5/5, then these were about 3/5. The soup wasn't exactly a juicy burst of flavor as expected, but instead just a burst of liquidy, oily meat stuff that your stomach could convert into energy.  Moving on to the entr√©e, the $10 for noodle soup is not a bad deal at all. There was plenty of meat and plenty of noodles in both bowls that we ordered, but along with the great portions came an extra portion of oil. As you can see in the picture, the oil was heavily pooled around the soup and gave it a greasy, unappetizing texture and appearance. Don't get me wrong - I love a good oily Chinese noodle soup, but this seemed a bit extra. That being said - the pork was very good! It was a bit tough in places, but had great flavor! The noodles were thick and hearty, so it's perfect for a cold Midwest day. The spicy beef was even better - the meat was beautifully tender and melted in the mouth. It did, however, suffer from the same oil issue and was also SO SPICY! Think shin ramyun x3. Since it was so heavily oil-based, it was difficult to appease the on-fire taste buds.   That being said, I would give LJ Shanghai a solid 3/5 in general, but 4/5 for Cleveland. I would definitely go back (mainly because there are literally no other options), but it really is nothing special. It's worth a taste, especially for the price!"}
{"text":"Amazing Chinese food! Service is quick and the quality of the food is so good! Have been there twice since it's opened, and would go much more frequently if I lived downtown."}
{"text":"Found this place whole in Cleveland for business. We orders dumplings, tripe, spicy beef noodles, and the vegetarian noodles. The noodles in the spicy beef noodles were wide, chewy, and great. The veggie broth was vland and the thin doing noodles were not as good from the texture. The tripe was spot on with the right kinda of chili oil. The dumplings were dry and didn't hold up to bring picked up via chopsticks(eg the correct way via the dough top). Minimal amount of soup present but the matt was juicy. Prices were very affordable, relative to those in Chicago suburbs. I will try again the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"They really got some incredible tasty food here! It's one of my favorite restaurants in US."}
{"text":"I haven't found a good place that serve some authentic Asian food until I went to this place. Best duck, awesome soup dumplings and there noodle dishes are very tasteful!"}
{"text":"First experience was very positive. This is excellent, affordable, cold-weather food in Cleveland's Asiatown.  You must get the soup dumplings ($5 for six) to begin. You need to be careful in transporting them from the wooden serving dish to your bowl. They are great covered with a generous helping of the chili sauce, which is among the condiments provided at each table. Also tried the cucumbers, which were tasty but don't include anything beyond slices of a quartered cucumber covered in a very light dressing.   The real winner here is the Spicy Noodle Soup that you can order plain ($8), with braised beef ($10) or with pig intestines ($10). I tried the beef and loved it. It is very hot; it will likely cause you break a minor sweat. One bowl of soup provides a filling, delicious dinner.   The wait staff seemed a little overwhelmed with the crowd but that should change soon: the door said they were currently hiring a server; I presume the availability of drink refills and extra napkins will be improved once the new popular restaurant is fully staffed.   I can't wait to go back and explore other menu items. I will definitely return for the dumplings and Spicy Noodle Soup this winter."}
{"text":"Came today to try this new place- excited that there is a legit Shanghai style Chinese place in Cleveland.  I and the family are huge fans of Michelin starred Din Tai Fung and we were curious how this place compared to it.   The restaurant is located in the building next door to Number 1 Pho.  There is only street parking around it.  Service is a bit sparse- we sat for over 10 minutes before I signaled to the lady who was manning the register that we were ready to eat.  Tables are smaller and packed in pretty close.  We took liberties of looking at the table of our neighbors.    Through the window on the other side of the restaurant, you can see two cute grandmas working to make the notable shaolong bao.  They smiled and waved when they saw me and my daughter.   We ordered three orders of shaolongbao (soup dumplings) 2 beef noodle soups, a pig ear, a tendon/tripe dish and a shrimp dumpling soup.  Food came out fast.  Everyone was great.  I loved the soup dumplings and wish I had ordered more. Some did break upon lifting off the paper.  Would be nice if there was a bed of Napa to steam them on.  They didn't give you ginger to eat with vinegar- when I asked they lady said that it was in the vinegar, and when I looked there was a little but I missed the small shreds of ginger that typically come with it in DTF.  Pickles were tasty but not very vinegary.  I wonder if it is a different style than what I anticipated.   Wonderful beef noodle soup.  Spicy, good chew to the noodles, generous hunks of beef shank.  I liked it better than Phusion Cafes version.  Shrimp dumpling soup was tasty with a clean tasting soup.  Crunchy pig ear was spicy and delicious and the tendon / tripe was better than I anticipated.  Ultimately, we ordered a lot of dishes and it was not cheap but it was good getting a sense for what this restaurant could do.   Great place, will be back."}
{"text":"Food is delicious!! I agree with the first reviewer, best spicy beef noodle soup!!! You can tell by the texture of the noodle, it is freshly made and not out of the frozen bag. Xiao long bao is authentic it can be, not frozen.  Looking forward to try more dishes here and highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is the worst restruant experience i ever had.when i was eating,i found a hair in the food and the meat and noodles are hard but the soup was alright.After i pay my bill,the owner or the waiter of that place come to my table and ask more tip in a super rude way, and didnt even give me a pen to change my original decent tip.I end up giving them more tip because i dont want to be rude like them.But this is my last time there!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant three times and since I and my friends eat a lot and we love to try multiple dishes, we've nearly tasted EVERYTHING on the menu, and I swear to my friend that I'll NEVER visit this place again because NOTHING there was good.  The first time we ordered soup dumplings and noodles. By the time we were ordering, the owner of the restaurant was talking to a customer in a nearly cringy tone saying that \"Sorry I'm from Shanghai so we only have the authentic Shanghainese cuisine. You can leave right now \"BULLSHIT. Spicy noodles along with other Szechuan dishes and Chongqing dishes on the menu are NOT from Shanghai and she's just being rude to that poor old lady. The spicy noodles were super oily but overall not tasty or spicy at all. The beef noodles were super sweet and that's the weirdest noodles I've ever had. Beef noodles from Han Chinese Kabob are way better than this.   Ok, when it comes to the soup dumplings I'll explain how this restaurant became the \"best restaurant in Cleveland that has soup dumplings\". In fact, this is the only restaurant in Cleveland that offers inauthentic soup dumplings so it automatically became the first place. If you really want to try out some really good soup dumplings, drive to Pittsburg and try \"Everyday Noodles\". Everything there is so much better even the female shop owner is much nicer. Soup dumplings here are stuck together, just the same as the frozen soup dumplings that roughly cost 3 dollars at the Chinese supermarket. The dough of the dumplings is completely wrong.   During the second time we went there we found out that they added some new dishes, and we ordered all of them, hopefully finding something tasty. However, this restaurant disappointed us one more time. Overall they did not even cook the dishes... all the stuff are stored in the fridge and taken out directly even without being microwaved. The spicy duck neck was stored in a fridge and they just took it out of the fridge, put some spicy oil above and it tastes terrible. The sweet and sour rib looks brown...-ish, which is not exactly the way it should look like. It should be a hot dish but it's another poor dish stored in the fridge and then being put on the table by the staff.   I did not give this restaurant a one star rating just because this is the only place in town to have soup dumplings."}
{"text":"Xiao long bao is very tasty.  Quite a few authentic Shanghai dishes including fried bean curd, boiled chicken, and pork and veggie wonton - the wonton skin has the right texture.  Other dishes are pretty good as well.  This is the best Chinese restaurant in Cleveland in my opinion."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic.  Just had a family dinner here tonight and we tried a bunch of items from the menu and everything was very good.  The soup dumplings, rice cakes and pan fried Shanghai noodles stood out as must tries.  Lots of native speakers here enjoying the authentic Shanghai cooking.  Decor is a bit underwhelming but does that matter if the food tastes this great? Bring your appetite, sense of adventure and don't expect anything fancy and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"They have good food... if they have it.  I was really excited to see this restaurant appear in Cleveland. We've needed a decent place for soup dumplings for a long time, and the menu looked awesome. My party arrived around 6:15PM on a Saturday for dinner.  After being seated and looking at the menus for a while, our waiter mentioned that three menu items (the two non-soup-buns and cucumber) were not available. Too bad, since they looked great and everyone wanted to try one. We got more soup dumplings instead. Then, after placing our orders, a few minutes later the waiter came back again to mention they were almost out of their wide noodles. Of the four of us who ordered them, only one could still get their dish. Like a some kind of surreal restaurant reality TV show, we had to figure out which lucky person got the dish they wanted and who had to compromise. Grandma, of course, won out. I do get it. Restaurants run out of things (though running out of a third the menu at 6pm on a Saturday is a bit much). The issue was that our waiter didn't mention it at the start of things. That said, he was very apologetic that we couldn't order from half of the menu.  The soup dumplings were good. They weren't the best that I've ever had, but they were solid. They didn't stick to the paper or fall apart on the spoon, which is always a good sign. I would happily order them again, and I feel that other reviewers' comparisons to Din Tai Fong are fair. For the one person who got their pan fried noodles, they said they were very good. My compromise dish, their soup with dumplings, was okay but not amazing. Fellow diners who had the chongqing soup noodles liked them, though they wished for more ingredients in the bowl besides noodles. The vegetarian enjoyed their noodle dish, but also wanted more toppings.  Overall the food was decent, but playing Mexican standoff with wide noodles was not an anticipated form of entertainment."}
{"text":"One of the most authentic Chinese restaurants in greater Cleveland. Come for the soup dumplings, stay for the spicy beef noodle soup! Very reasonable price for a lot of flavorful food. (Warning- if you do not enjoy very spicy food, ask for the beef soup mild). Order the cool cucumbers with garlic for a perfect compliment to the hot soup."}
{"text":"Soup dumplings were amazing and reasonably priced.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  Will be returning."}
{"text":"Hate to say this because I've had some wonderful experiences at JH Shanghai.  This visit the food was so salty it was tough to eat.  In particular, the plate of Shanghai noodles in a brown (obviously soy-based sauce.)  Anyone watching their sodium intake, take warning!"}
{"text":"So excited to have a place in Cleveland that makes soup dumplings (aka steamed pork buns on the menu)!"}
{"text":"The soup dumplings were amazing! I had the spicy noodle soup it was very spicy for my taste but overall good. Food was good but service was slow. Went around 1 p.m. on a Friday. Waiter took a while to take our order and was not very attentive."}
{"text":"This place has the best dumplings.  Pure authentic.  The other food is great too.  Lived in San Fran and Chicago so have tasted much authentic foods."}
{"text":"Very different from other people's opinions, my experience with this restaurant was pretty bad. They didn't have a number system when you get there, so you don't know who's there first and last. It was a big crowd standing by the door, guessing it might be you next. It was a chaos. Then after sitting down, we got forgotten by the waitress. It took a while to get their attention and order. The Xuecai noodle I got was not thoroughly cooked and smelled funny. Xiaolongbao was fine but they were out of other buns. I was very disappointed considering how many good reviews they got. The napkin they brought us was wet (ew!)... I won't come back again."}
{"text":"I am so happy this place is open!  We were always complaining that there wasn't a good soup dumplings place in Cleveland and that we had to go to New York to get them.  This place fits the bill. The soup dumplings are amazing!!!  The other things are delicious too!  I came here for lunch today and I am ready to come back for dinner.  The owner is super nice and friendly.  We will definitely be back many times."}
{"text":"Lamar-Ding here and I have to say that i find myself coming here more often than i do any other restaurant in the area. Im in love with the soup dumplings and spicy soups here. Every time i come here it seems like i bring a small army with hungry bellies with me. I always order atleast one order of soup dumplings and something else to compliment it. I didnt even notice until my 5th or so visit but there is a very large window to the kitchen area where you can see the food being prepared.  There is one thing that i noticed and that is the customer service gets better and better each and every time i come back. The owner of the establishment \"LJ\" herself, has waited my tables on multiple occasions she never complains that i bring in obserd large groups and welcomes us with open arms and great conversation. I know how difficult it can be as a server to have small talk with individual tables in a busy restsurant but she always makes time. I know she cant always eait our tables when we go but i wish she could!!"}
{"text":"LJ Shanghai is a great place to go for \"small eats\" and cafe style food. We've been a few times now and have enjoyed the soup dumplings every time - they make them fresh and the wrappers have gotten more tender each time. (If you are new to soup dumplings, do yourself a favor and learn how to eat them before you go - don't let the soup inside the dumpling spill out! That's the best part!)  The Chongqing style beef noodle soup is delicious. It packs a ton of heat unapologetically. The sliced pork (belly) noodle soup is also really good- not spicy but with a light/clean broth. The pork and veg wontons also come with a really light and clean broth as well.  For sides, we typically go with the cucumber side dish and the spicy pig ear dish. We'll consistently be back to try other small dishes too!"}
{"text":"???????????? ???? If you love noodles then this place won't disappoint you. We ordered Chongqing favor noodle (both 2 kinds) and we all love it, it's bit spicy and the Chongqing beef noodle has huge beef shank. It would be prefect if they have black vinegar on the table instead of the plum vinegar.  Definitely will come again and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"I went a few months ago when it was just opening. FINALLY a place to get soup dumplings in Cleveland. They were pretty good, I would definitely go again. The service was very good: staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"LJ Shanghai.   I was invited by friends to try out this place since their dumplings had such good reviews. Boy was I happy that I tagged along. $5 for 6 dumplings? Yes, please! I loooooove dumplings, I am so glad Cleveland finally has a place with soup dumplings (where there is broth within the dumpling along with its filling).   Interior is very spacious with few decor. They have pictures of food items (such as bubble tea) attached to their walls, which may be misleading since they do not offer such items yet (or so I have been told). There is street side parking outside the business.   Service was decent. They were not as attentive or professional, however, their business is still new. I cannot wait to come back after awhile to see how they will improve. (:"}
{"text":"I had the spicy beef noodle soup and one order of xiao long bao. Both were tasty and I would come back again.  The prices are fair. $10 for the spicy beef noodle soup and $5 for 6 xiao long bao."}
{"text":"So excited to have a go-to for soup dumplings. We have only had them at dim sum around here. The flavor was great, but more importantly, they were well made. We could easily pick them up out of the serving dish without them rupturing. We ordered cucumber salad (very refreshing with the rich foods and good crunch) and an egg roll (meh, but not important part of this place). We also tried the spicy beef soup (good amount of heat! I coughed a little, in a good way!) and the fried noodles (most complex flavor--toasty and roasty, salty, yum). Very hearty, perfect noodle texture. Love it. I also appreciated that they were very concerned with finding us a seat where there was room for our baby to sit in her car seat.  Great, fast and considerate service, and they were busy!   They have a lot of beautiful pictures on the wall of food, and we asked if they would be including some of the things in their menu. The server mentioned that they were working on adding things on and taking a couple things off, so this place should probably stay relevant based on feed back. I agree with other people, hope to taste different flavors of the soup dumplings!!"}
{"text":"Nice to have a solid Shanghai restaurant around here. I've had much better but for Cleveland it's probably up there for top Chinese restaurant in the area. I usually get their beef noodle soup (caution it's real spicy)"}
{"text":"My better half and I were visiting Cleveland for a recent vacation and stopped here for soup dumplings at the recommendation of a local friend to satisfy my craving. The Shanghai soup dumplings came out quickly and the restaurant itself felt \"authentic\" to me (i.e. it's no frills).   The pan fried flat noodles were underwhelming and needed more veggies and meat. The garlic cucumbers were also a bland for my taste, but perhaps my expectations were too high.  If I were to return again I'd probably just order 3 orders of the soup dumplings because they were the star of the show. In my humble opinion this is a Yelp 3-star restaurant if compared to a NYC Shanghai soup dumpling restaurant, but 4 stars for Cleveland."}
{"text":"I've been using Yelp for 5 years and it was the first time reviewing because I was so pissed off by this restaurant. This is just a shit place. I've never been to a place with such a terrible service. The waitress gave us wrong dish and we didn't know since we ordered a lot, and she literally shouted at us: YOU SHOULD NOT EAT. Also, she DID NOT apologize at all for giving us wrong dish and asked us to pay for that. We ordered A LOT and how could we know it was not the noodle we ordered since it was our first time here. Worst dinning experience ever with bad taste food.  Okay, this is the reply from the owner. You are obviously talking about another guest and apparently, you gave them WRONG dish again. I just want to clarify that 1)We had a few people not just myself 2)We drove, not on Uber 3)It was not snowing when we came that day 4)We DID NOT switch any order and we did not order curry soup 5)It was entirely your fault for giving us wrong dish ------- \"The menu shows it's not a noodle dish, and our waitress showed you again after you asked. You ordered the beef noodle soup first, and then you just switched to the curry soup so fast after you saw that item, we thought you know what it is. For real we don't know it's your first time here, we just did double check after you ordered. Our boss just checked the camera, there was nobody shouted you, or asked you don't eat. Actually the camera showed the waitress was very nice to you, they reminded you don't forget any personal stuff, stay warm (it was snowing) and let you stayed for a while till the Uber came even the restaurant was already closed, and all the employees were gone just the boss left. Anyway, feel sad you didn't get what you want.\" ------- Okay, another victim. Bye Bye. Good luck surviving in Cleveland with your fantastic service."}
{"text":"Soup dumplings  have arrived in Cleveland! While they don't quite compare to those I've had in NYC's Chinatown, these soup dumplings are pretty freaking good. For $5 you get 6, smaller, but still good sized dumplings!  Note: The entrance is off superior past No. 1 Pho.  I'll definitely be back to try more from the menu!"}
{"text":"As noted by most everyone, come here for the soup Dumplings.  Spicy beef noodle soup was very good, extremely spicy, I had to eat it slowly! Garlic cucumber app was a nice counterpoint to the soup."}
{"text":"The soup dumplings are definitely good and a must when visiting here. The rest of the food can be hit or miss (more on the hit though.)  The staff is friendly and attentive"}
{"text":"What a killer meal! We had the xioa long bao, spicy beef noodle soup and the pork noodle soup and everything was delicious. The soup portions are huge, I took half of my soup togo. The service was excellent. Both of us dropped our chopsticks on the ground before we got our food (out of fidgeting excitement) and the server was gracious to promptly replace them. Hot tea was gratis and water was replenished while we were slurping away. Already can't wait to have my leftovers AND come back to try other dishes. Triple quadruple yum."}
{"text":"Awesome spot!  Dumplings are in point and I'm glad that I don't have to go back to NYC just to get them.  Cute interior, rad staff, busy but pretty quick to get the grub out. I can't stop eating here..."}
{"text":"Heard a lot about this place online and decided to give it a try - after all- they're supposed to have the best soup dumplings around. If soup dumplings are supposed to be dry on the top, fall apart as they stick to the paper in the steam basket, and have nondescript pork mush inside - then yes they have the best! ?  We also ordered Curry Soup with glass noodles, egg roll, Spicy tripe and tendon, and Spicy Beef Soup. Unimpressed. Besides the fact the family staff of 4 ignored us once we got our food (one cup of tea never refilled, and water only after flagging down the 10 year old boy doing odd jobs) their credit card machine went down! The family next to us didn't have cash and the owner did not seem sympathetic...\"You go to ATM.\" Where  does one go exactly at 31st and Superior???? I got pissed just listening as the dad had to promise to return and pay without leaving his family as collateral. We finished our meal as the mom returned to pay - no discount for the inconvenience or anything. Luckily we had cash, but that wasn't the point. I wanted double miles on my credit card! My husband gave me the evil  and just paid with cash and gave a bigger tip than I would have given. Not sure we'll be returning.  But, as a point of discussion... what is the expectation in this day and age of technology when the credit card reader is down?"}
{"text":"I first came here in December when it first opened.  When I heard a restaurant that specializes in soup dumplings was opening in Cleveland, I was extremely excited! The soup dumplings do not disappoint- they are consistently very fresh and full of steaming broth.  Plus, $5 gets you 6, which I'd say is a great deal.  I give LJ Shanghai 4 stars instead of 5 because the other dishes in the restaurant are not as good as the soup dumplings, and there are other Chinese restaurants in Cleveland that are better.  However, overall, LJ Shanghai is a great addition to the Cleveland food scene, and if you haven't been, you should definitely go try it out."}
{"text":"Welcoming atmosphere, friendly staff, delicious food though some options might be too spicy for some. Food quality was better when less busy, but I feel they will get better, and this place will thrive. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good dumpling!"}
{"text":"Impressed with the quality and taste of everything I ordered! I had the soup dumplings, a shrimp and veggie egg roll, shredded pork with pickle noodle soup and the fried pork chop. I ate it all. Alone. It was that good! The noodles are hand made, the broth super flavorful and everything served piping hot. Don't burn your mouth!"}
{"text":"Went here with my mom and friend. Delicious food, fast service. Ordered the spicy beef noodle soup and the xiaolongbao. Did not disappoint! Spicy, quality beef and handmade noodles!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the soup dumplings here. I don't even know how to describe how good they are, that's how good they are! I also got soup while there and I'll just say, it might not be for the faint of heart. I noticed about a couple dozen beady eyes looking back at me in my soup and they were brine shrimp! I honestly didn't notice it while eating the soup, it was just unexpected! I also got the feeling that this place was really authentic so I trusted their choice of adding brine shrimp!"}
{"text":"Whoa! Soup dumplings in Cleveland? Am I at Din Tai Fung? Nope! LJ Shanghai! Lots of awesome noodle soups on the menu. On this night, I had the pork belly noodle soup! Yasss!!! Will be back often to try the rest of the menu!!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. I almost don't want to advertise to try and keep the traffic down, but I'm probably too late. They got it right simple, authentic, delicious dishes. We got the soup dumplings, stellar. The pork belly noodles, the broth was amazing, the noodles were fresh and had perfect texture.  The ribs were the best.  We'll be back"}
{"text":"The soup dumplings are yummy and authentic, not quite as good as Ding Tai Fung, but only because of the skins.  Everything else on the menu was underwhelming in flavor.  The spicy noodle soup at least had good ma la heat, but was lacking in depth of flavor.  The beef itself was done very well, succulent and fork tender, and the noodles had a nice chew to them.  I had wanted to try the shanghai style salmon, but they didn't have any that day.  The rest of the noodle dishes, including the rice cakes, were flat in flavor and quite disappointing.  I'd say go early to avoid the wait on the weekend and just get a few orders of dumplings, then go over to Li Wah for dim sum!"}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves beyond 5 stars. The food here is unearthly and is packed full of flavor and deliciousness. The juicy soup dumplings and the spicy beef noodle soup were amazing and had me and my family on cloud 9.The service was impeccable and the owner was so sweet and welcoming. The tea was spot on and refilled readily. Don't ask for sugar because there is non in the building, remember this is Shanghainese not Mcdonalds. LJ Shanghai has traditional Shanghainese dishes and it is the perfect place for a hearty and adventurous dinner. Do not go in here expecting general tso's or lo mein because what they have to offer here is a thousand times better. If you're not going to respect the way the chef cooks, pay your tab and keep it movin. This place offers a unique experience and if you aren't willing to be open to something that hasn't been americanized then don't come here to complain, you uncultured swine. She orders everything straight from China so your food can't get anymore authentic than that, in my opinion. Give it a try and Im sure youll thank yourself you did."}
{"text":"Took the family here today, it lived up to all of the previous 5 star reviews.  The waiter was fast, friendly, and attentive.  Split an order of soup dumplings, wife had the Shanghai Scallion Noodle, wife and daughter had egg rolls.  I had the Mixed Veggies Noodle Soup, it was extremely tasty with incredibly fresh vegetables including mushrooms and bok choy.  The bowl was huge, I passed out veggies to my wife and daughter, ate half of what remained, and still had almost an entire take out container left over.  The complimentary tea was appreciated, served in cute cups with finger indentations."}
{"text":"Their spicy beef noodles and sweet dumplings are my favorite. Best Chinese food in Cleveland so far."}
{"text":"You can tell this place is still establishing themselves as they appear to be a small mom-and-pop-shop type business , but the workers are fantastic and even when they're busy they are assuring that everyone gets their order in a reasonable time . Having been to only one other soup dumpling / fresh noodle place in Pittsburgh I was super excited to hear about one in my home city of Cleveland . THE SPICY BEEF SOUP IS BOMB! The broth is savory and just the perfect level of heat , the noodles are fresh and the soup dumplings super delicious. No complaints here !"}
{"text":"The only place in Cleveland with legit xiao long bao, soup dumplings! If you've had din tai fung or Joe's shanghai soup dumplings, these will do to satisfy your cravings. Not quite DTF but still damn good. It would be nice if they offered ginger to go along with the dumplings but hey its in Cleveland so I'm happy they're here. And they make these fresh in house! I hope they will offer more variety with fillings in the future, as of right now its just pork. Would love to see a crab xiao long bao, and veggie one (like mushroom?)  The spicy beef noodle soup deserves a nod as well, very flavorful broth with the right amount of kick, tender fall apart beef, and although their noodles are not hand pulled, they import their noodles from Canada, it had the perfect amount of chewiness and tasted so fresh..would've fooled me if they said those were made in house too.  The service was excellent and quick. I did dine on a dreary Tues night and there was only 2 other parties. I hope they continue the quality of service and food as they get more popular, which I am sure they will with $5 soup dumplings! Let's hope they keep their affordable prices too! Great job LJ Shanghai, I'm impressed!"}
{"text":"This is going to be a very quick review since the menu is very limited in the vegetarian items on the menu.  I stopped for a quick lunch and was impressed, the decor is simple but modern and clean.  The menu is 2 sided with pictures of all the items.  For those of us who avoid meat and foul there are only a couple of items.  I ordered the scallion noodles, which came out rather quickly.  A nice sized portion of buckwheat noodles was served warm in a light broth.  Although simple, the flavors and quality was very good, the noodles had a firm texture and good flavor, especially when I added the spicy oil that leveled up the flavor quotient.  If the rest of the menu is as good as these simple noodles, then you should check it out."}
{"text":"Decent food, we had the soup dumplings and the chongqing noodles. The duck neck was also very tasty. I think service is terrible and the waiters/waittresses are inexperienced, overworked, and poorly trained. You wont get attention unless you are more aggressive and ask for it, or bring a Chinese speaking friend with you. Spoons were dirty and so we cleaned them ourselves. The waiter also did not have a writing pad to write our orders down on, so he asked three times what our order was. Attitudes have room for improvement. If you are unable to accommodate the amount of business you are getting, learn to scale back and set reservations instead."}
{"text":"The soup dumplings were excellent! So good we had to order seconds. I also got the duck, which I thought was ok. Lots of bones to pick around. I'll skip it next time. My girlfriend got the pan fried noodles, which I thought were really good, and worth ordering again.  5 stars for the soup dumplings, 4 stars overall, because the service was so so. Walked in, no one at the front, looked a little busy, but we were left standing at the front door like idiots. After about 5 mins., had to go to the cash register in the back where they were ignoring us from, to ask to be seated. Also, once we were obviously done eating, it took awhile for them to come give us our check."}
{"text":"The soup dumplings are good! They stick to the pan a bit which is detrimental as you don't want to be spilling the precious soup out! I didn't love the other things we ordered (wonton soup and Shanghai noodles). I definitely think the soup dumplings were the star here! The service was a bit slow and seemed scattered, but worth a stop in for the dumplings alone."}
{"text":"The soup dumplings are worth the trip -- they're among the best dumplings, of any kind, you'll find in Cleveland. That said, they're far from the best soup dumplings I've ever had. The dumpling itself was a bit thin, which makes it hard to keep it intact when you're lifting it out of the bamboo steamer. The broth itself could've been a bit hotter. But the flavor was spot-on. The real star on this menu is the fried flat noodle. The thick, chewy rice noodles and bits of gamey pork offal makes for an elevated version of any plate of lo mein you've ever had.  It's a small menu, but I plan on trying everything on my subsequent trips."}
{"text":"Love the Xiao long bao here! Authentic! All the chefs are from Shanghai. The Chongqing Spicy noodle is also good. The beef is very tender."}
{"text":"Finally a xlb place in Cleveland... They are good and their spicy short rib noodles are the bomb! We have been weekly since it opened. So good!"}
{"text":"Love the xiao long bao and spicy beef soup!!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced, courteous and prompt service, and high quality food with great flavor. The spicy beef soup was some of the best soup I've ever had. The steamed buns (pork dumplings) were excellent, and a good value at $5 for 6. Too bad we live 8 hours away!"}
{"text":"Soup dumplings are pretty good.  Also had the pickled cucumbers,  pork with pickled vegetable soup, pork belly noodle soup, and the stir fry pork and noodles.  All were pretty authentic and tasty.  Just a tad bit on the salty side."}
{"text":"I came to LJ Shanghai because I'd heard amazing things about their Soup Dumplings and Scallion Noodles. Both of these items were delicious, and I'd absolutely order them again via takeout.  The rest of the things I tried were not so tasty. I tried the spare rib appetizer, the spring rolls, and the Chong Qing Spicy Beef Noodle Soup, and all of these things were very oily or greasy and did not taste fresh.  The ambiance in the restaurant is lacking. The tables are very close together and the use of space is really bad. The service was pretty attentive, and though the waitstaff was nice, we had 4 different servers, our order was wrong, they did not have any of the drinks that are plastered on posters all over the restaurant (which is super confusing), and at the end of our meal, they let us know that they were only accepting cash-- which we were not prepared for. I hope that as time goes on they are able to work this stuff out, because I think this place has potential!"}
{"text":"After eating for the first time at din tai fung in Los Angeles last week, I was pleasantly surprised that the xiao long bao was better here. The service was friendly and attentive. It's worth noting that our server said there is a new chef coming to improve the menu in a month or so. I will definitely be back soon.   I had the Chong Qing spicy beef noodle soup and 2 orders of the xiao long bao (steamed dumplings on menu). My mom is visiting and had the pan fried flat flat noodles which was good too, but she loved the dumplings. She can't eat spicy food and was satisfied with her dish.  Relatively cheap prices too!"}
{"text":"I feel that their servers need more training since the consumers were waiting and no one checked on us. So basically we need to remember the order ourselves. I had pork soup dumplings and spicy noodle soup. Dumplings were juicy but not really surprising, and the skin is not cooked enough. Spicy noodle soup was a bit salty and spicy, and I kinda got tired of it in the end due to too much grease."}
{"text":"I found this place downtown Cleveland in the heart of Chinatown. It has great lunch menu with reasonable prices. I ordered the soup dumplings which came very hot and you dip it into a vinegar/soy sauce. Be carful because it has soup in it and it's filled with pork. It came with six dumplings per order which was a generous amount. When I got up to go to the bathroom, I peeked in the back and saw them hand-making the dumplings. On top of that, I ordered a spicy mixed veggie noodle soup. The soup was very spicy and I even ordered it medium spicy. I have to say it was fantastic. It had flavor and the noodles soaked up the broth. I loved both items and the total bill for all this food was 12.87! Great price and great food. I will be coming back when I go back to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great, complex broth in the soups and the dumpling nags are outta this world.  The spicy beef noodle soup comes molten hot and has a nice bit of spice."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner during one of the colder nights which was totally fine because tea was readily available. I was beyond excited to try this place. Why you may ask?   Soup Dumplings in Cleveland! FINALLY! And I have to say, they really are good. I do wish that they were served with a nappa leaf or something under them so they don't stick. If the dumpling tears the soup obviously spills out. But overall, they're really good - if there was anything they could \"improve\" on it's just to add more soup but the taste itself is great.  Apart from the dumplings I also went with the Spicy Beef Noodle Soup. It's spicy and very very hearty with plenty of meat and noodles. There's also some greens so it's not overwhelmingly meat-y or carb-y though a word of caution, the hot soup will be between the pieces of bok choy (or possibly bok choy's cousin?) so just keep that in mind so you don't burn yourself like I did. Maybe that's just an obvious thing to think about, oops. Overall it's a perfect choice for a cold night.  A downside of this place is that there doesn't seem to be very many vegetarian options that are entrees. This wasn't an issue for me but keep that in mind if that's a restriction.  What I also appreciated was the prices. The dumplings are pretty average in size (not too small or too large) and you pay $5 for 6 dumplings. The soup, which was huge, was only $10. Not bad at all. It's very clean and nicely decorated with plenty of tables. It also seems popular (makes sense) with plenty of people there for dinner and lunch (I went back a second time to get dumplings for lunch, can you blame me?). The service is pretty hands off but perfectly pleasant.  Overall, great place for lunch or dinner or you know, a to-go box of dumplings."}
{"text":"Best spicy noodles I had for a long time, Noodles has a nice texture and the soup is top notch. Try it and you will say the same."}
{"text":"This is the Din Tai Fong of Cleveland. Perhaps because it's the only dedicated xiao long bao (broth dumplings) place in Cleveland.   The dumplings are not as good as Din Tai Fong. The top closing portion of the dough is too thick and too dry from the Din Tai Fong standard, however the flavors of the dumplings itself is excellent.   2 adults and 1 toddler, together we ate 6 baskets. My tot ate one by herself. We also ordered shrimp wontons but it's not that special in CLE Asia town. Everything else on the menu is schezhen spicy.  We will come back again, probably only order xiao long bao."}
{"text":"Finally checked this place out with my boyfriend and we were both in love! We got the soup dumplings (obviously), one of the spicy soups, and a side of cucumbers. Everything was delicious! We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Came for the xiao long bao or soup dumplings everyone is talking about. They were amazing and a real treat on a cold winter evening. These could be addictive, so I'm trying to think shady thoughts about them. The really amazing part was the Beef Curry Soup W. Vermicelli. Best noodle soup I've had in Cleveland. LJ Shanghai is a welcome addition to the Asian Town scene. The owner and service staff were very friendly and helpful. Turns out LJ did not know of the feature article in Scene about her restaurant, though she had to have been a part of it. She is running everything and must be tremendously busy, as she told me she needed more help. Bring on the Aunties. I loved it so much I am considering another visit for carry-out this very evening."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try this place! The soup dumplings were really good and it was my first time having them. Also had the duck (appetizer portion. Something I wish they would tell you.) Also had the shrimp and veggie egg roll was good. I would probably try this place again for one of their noodle bowls."}
{"text":"small steam buns were good, price was good.  \"smoked\" fish didn't taste like smoked, but rather cold deep fried fish.  Duck was way way way way way overpriced.  Haven't tried other stuff yet, need to go back again."}
{"text":"Heyyyyoooo, LJ Shanghai. There's a reason the stars are so high here. The food is excellent. I dragged my friend here after drooling over all the photos and basically just having a fascination with Shanghainese. I never met a noodle I didn't like!  I love a place that brings you hot tea the minute you walk in. There's not much ambiance here, but its the no-frills dining experience you'd expect on this stretch of Superior. There are a few street spots right outside for free. LJ Shanghai has a small but mighty menu that consists of maybe 10 appetizers, some soups, and noodle dishes all at inexpensive prices (an entree is in the $10 range). We had the cucumbers with garlic (oddly satisfying) and the dumplings as appetizers, which my friend fawned over. The dumplings are an easy win if you're dining with guests and are served nearly immediately. For dinner, I had the pork noodle, which turned out to be soup and came with huge pieces of pork and a hearty portion of noodle (a box was needed). The food came out lightning fast.  So, why not 5-stars? The service is still a little off and I hope this is something they're working on. We made the mistake of waiting for someone to come by every now and then. Tip: Ask for everything at once, otherwise, you'll be awkwardly trying to get someone's attention everytime you need a fork, want a water refill, would like to order your entree, want the check, etc. I don't ask for much, just come by at least once during our meal and that would be nice. Other than that, I really enjoyed LJ Shanghai and will be back!"}
{"text":"As a Shanghainese, I'm kind of disappointed. There is not enough soup in the steamed soup dumplings. The filling, grounded pork, is sort of sour. Don't know what they mix the meat with. The braised duck with soy sauce is too dry and light. It's not tasty."}
{"text":"When it's cold- there's nothing better than noodles!  And it was a cold day in a strange city- so I yelped this place with great reviews.  First off- your map may tell you to turn to go behind the building- DON'T! It's in front by the nail supply.  It was early so still parking out front- there is a lot on the side street if you can't find street parking.   Ordering was interesting, I was querying about details on the soups and was simply told what the menu said.  Descriptions are \"pork noodle soup\" and \"beef vermicelli soup.\"  (The part I could understand anyway.) Pictures are a nice thing to have.  Having read other reviews I knew it was important to get the soup dumplings also.  I was not unhappy with my selection.  The pork soup was served with two nice sized pieces of pork- a bit fatty- I didn't eat it all but did try- was tasty.  The broth was exactly what the cold day called for, very rich and full of flavor. I placed the soup dumplings in the broth and used a bit of the spicy hot oil.  In theory the review on soup dumplings said \"eat in one bite\" but I found that difficult.  I had trouble eating everything as I ordered enough for two- but I did my best and left this restaurant with an extremely full belly.  I paid my tab at the counter and had a pleasant conversation with the cashier as I left.  The restaurant appears to have two areas- I was in the \"main\" one with several tables and decorations.  It's well lit, sparse, and at time noisy from stuff going on overhead (kids?).  Great place to visit."}
{"text":"Fantastic pork noodles ($10) with delicious soup and pork belly. Also had great xiaolongbao (6 for $5) and a very sweet staff."}
{"text":"Amazing. Been looking for soup dumplings for many years and finally found them locally.  EVERYONE in the restaurant while we were here ordered the soup dumplings.  They were amazing.  Clean restaurant with friendly servers.  We loved it and will be back."}
{"text":"There is another special LJ in Cleveland that is making a name in the city: LJ Shanghai.  A newer restaurant in the Cleveland area, LJ Shanghai offers a unique flavor away from other options in the area which tend to be greasier in nature. With delicious noodle soups and their famous soup dumplings, LJ Shanghai provides a level of comfort food that cannot be found elsewhere. Finally, a place to have my fill of noodle soup.  LJ Shanghai might not meet the standards of west coast soup dumplings, but I knew that there was something special here when I left the restaurant feeling satisfied, even after having had my share of soup dumplings in Flushing, NY. Their skin is on the thicker side, leading me to wonder if they make their own skin, and one area which slightly missed the mark was the broth of the soup, which did not have the usual heavier flavors, but overall, they were delicious, soupy, and remarkably affordable.  For tips on eating soup dumplings: - Use your chopsticks to bring the dumpling to your soup spoon (careful not to break the skin) - The broth is HOT so be careful not to burn yourself- poking a hole in the skin can help let some steam out - While not mandatory, the dumpling tastes better in one bite :)  - You are doing yourself a disfavor by not eating the soup dumplings right away or taking this dish to go  The restaurant's broth may not be up to the standard level of spice that people familiar with the traditional tastes may be used to, but its lower level of spicy helps make their dishes tolerable for most customers. That is not to say that the broth itself lacks flavor- by all means, a lower spice level arguably means that the other flavors itself need to make up the difference, and the broths we've had, coupled with the delicious garnish of pickles and cilantro, definitely do.  So far, we've had the shredded pork with pickle noodle soup and the beef noodle soup. The noodles are a good chew and my mouth is watering thinking about the unique tastes of both of the broths. Unfortunately, the wonton soup we had on our first visit was overly salted, but will give it another go in a future trip; the wontons themselves were good and seemed to be hand prepared.  LJ Shanghai is up and coming- they are trying to hire more hands because people are realizing what a gem this place is so that service will be able to handle the demand of customers. I usually go up to the cash register to pay for my meal at the end, though I'm not certain if that is the standard expectation ($10 minimum for credit cards). The restaurant is no frills- great eats, good service, dedicated staff, and amazing prices, without the trendy, hip vibe other restaurants may go for.  Overall, the winter season and the city of Cleveland just got way better with the introduction of a fresh, new LJ on the block ready to make a statement."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal! You must try the soup dumplings and spice it up with the chili sauce they provide at each table. Best way to eat? Puncture the dumpling and let the broth ooze out in your spoon (also helps to cool off) then devour.  Also worth trying are the cucumbers with just the right amount of garlic and the Shanghai pan fried noodles. Yum! Service has always been quick and very efficient."}
{"text":"Even though the service took awhile, the food was fantastic. We ordered soup dumplings [xiao long bao] and the shrimp and pork wonton soup and both were delicious!! Everything had so much flavor and I was impressed at how well made the wonton soup was. The soup dumplings are definitely on par with din tai fung, they just need other flavors as well. They have some of the best Chinese food in Cleveland, and I'll definitely come back here for more!"}
{"text":"We came here for the soup dumplings. When they bring them out to the table, you have to time it right to eat it. At first it's too hot to eat and you will burn your mouth. Then there is a 15ish minute window where they are nice and juicy. But once you pass that window, the soup gets soaked up in the meat, so it's not going to explode when you bite it.   I fell in love with their pork noodle soup. The broth was flavorful and not too salty. They give you a decent portion of pork with it. The noodles are not chewy but aren't soggy either. It was the perfect consistency.   My mom ordered the salty vegetables noodle soup. There was nothing special about it. The only other time I've had this was when my dad would make ramen for me and added a packet of pickled veggies. It tastes the same. Wasn't better than ramen that you quickly whip up at home.   They are reasonably priced for most their items. All except the boiled chicken. The boiled chicken is $15 and you get a quarter of a chicken. For a Chinese restaurant, this is really costly for the amount you receive. The chicken itself tasted bland. But they give you this really good soy sauce on the side. I just dump the whole piece of the chicken in there before I eat it."}
{"text":"What?! When I heard that Cleveland got a soup dumpling spot I had to go check it out. I met my friend there and when we were seated we were immediately served hot tea and presented menus. It was super frigid outside and we greatly appreciated the hot tea. The arrangement of the menu with small pictures and descriptions was well thought out making ordering a quick process.  The soup dumplings were wonderful. These will be a regular item that I order. The fried breaded pork chop was crispy and tasty. The spicy beef noodle soup was fantastic. I was worried about how spicy it would be with the heavy hot oil appearance when it was brought to our table. This was not the case. It was spicy but not too spicy. Large pieces of tender beef,  fantastic firm noodles, and some baby bok choy made for a very satisfying soup.  The food was absolutely outstanding. Great service from our waitress with regular walk-bys to refill our drinks. An overall delightful experience that will have me coming back."}
{"text":"Move over Wonton Gourmet, there's a new Chinese restaurant gunning for number 1.  As you may have heard, LJ Shanghai serves xiao long bao, soup dumplings! I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the dumplings; they are not easy to make. The skin is a little thicker and chewier than I'm used to, and the dumplings are slightly larger. The meat inside is tender, and the soup inside is savory. If you are coming to this restaurant, the xiao long bao are a must-order.  The restaurant additionally serves a variety of other appetizers and noodle dishes. I was impressed with the wontons; they stay very true to the Shanghai flavor. The other noodle dishes are varying degrees of spicy, and are good as well.  Overall, I'm very happy Cleveland finally got a restaurant that serves (great) xiao long bao. My only complaint is that the menu is rather small and limited; however, LJ Shanghai makes up in quality what it lacks in quality."}
{"text":"The soup dumplings are fantastic! We also tried the spicy beef soup which was very flavorful and medium spicy. The other dishes we had (wonton soup and pan fried noodles) were good but not as good as the spicy beef soup and dumplings. Looking forward to trying more!"}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????This is a very nice restaurant, and it's good for breakfast. Typical Shanghai breakfast, worth to come!"}
{"text":"Coming from Brooklyn and this soup dumpling is legit! The soup has rich profile of flavors infused in good fat, the color is creamy and smell is like freshly steamed pork meatball! We had the beef noodle as well, it is spicy and you damn sure you will be sneezing at the end of the dinner!"}
{"text":"Visited Cleveland and multiple friends recommended the beef noodles and soup dumplings so I had to try! The Chongqing beef noodles were amazing! The noodles tasted handmade, the texture was chewy, and it was very flavorful. It is spicy though, so if you can't eat a lot of spice it may be hard, although I found that it you take the noodles out in a spoon or bowl and put some vinegar on it, it lessens the spice and tastes very good. I heard the vinegar is made in house as well. The soup dumplings were great, I do wish there was a little bit more soup. I make soup dumplings at home so it was not so rare but would definitely try it if you've never had it or don't get to eat it often. The service was quick even though they were swamped. Overall enjoyed my meal a lot!"}
{"text":"The update menu added a lot more noodle dishes. Few more starters. Great comfort food. All the noodle dishes are excellent. Each have own flavor. Yum.  Some we frequent 2 times a week."}
{"text":"I'm a bit of a soup dumplings connoseur; I've had them on several occasions in the highest-rated joints in NYC, and these ones are nowhere close. Maybe we just got a bad batch, but there was literally *no* broth inside them, and the dough was a bit dry and chewy. The meatball had a good flavor, but these were nothing like what my wife or I was expecting.  Someday i will give them a second chance, but my first impression fell way short of the mark."}
{"text":"Had this last night for the first time and the food was good but the service can be better. It took them 20 minutes to come back to our table to check on us for the bill . No refill on the hot tea or water. My friend literally went up to tell the lady we need our separate checks and to go boxes. My other friend paid with her debit card. She doesn't  like putting tips on her card so as she was trying to walk up to the cashier to get change for a $10 ( her bill was $12) the waiter stopped her mid way and told her to leave a tip because he saw that she didn't put a tip on her transaction sheet. Yes we are paying for your service but you cant come up demanding a tip where we were initially wanting to leave in the first place makes us want to take our tip back. I had to deduct the rating down because that incident really left a bad taste in our mouth. The food is still 3-4 stars at most"}
{"text":"Stopped by here one afternoon with my whole family as we were passing through Cleveland. Kind of... We actually drove out of the way just for this lunch TBH. We ordered a little bit of everything.. the stand out items to me were the Shanghai fried noodles, xiao long bao (soup dumplings), and spicy beef noodle soup.   There's not much in the way of decor/neighborhood/ambiance, and service was average (but satisfactory), but the food was just amazing and for a great value! Authentic, tender noodles and beef. Everything was flavorful, hot, and really hit the usually-insatiable noodle spot. We're a noodle family... we truly love noodles of all kinds!! I'm also glad my family likes sharing because I was stealing food from everyone and slurping their soups.   I wish this wasn't a 2 hour drive from where I live.. I'd be back weekly! But we already plan to return the next time we're in the area! Actually I'd honestly consider maybe just doing the drive just to eat here... my SO disagrees as I'd probably nap and he'd be the one driving..... TBD We'll see ;)"}
{"text":"Stopping in for a quick meal with no expectations and left incredibly happy. The waitress was so friendly and delightful. She was constantly running around to deliver things to a bunch of tables - I was super impressed.   5+ stars service. 4 stars tastes. Subjective 3.5 stars temperature (see below).  The waitress brought me some tea, which was pretty warm but not hot. For the record, I love things scalding hot, so this is obviously subjective. I've also had a bunch of xlb up in ny and dc as my only real comparison.  I got an order of the xlb (obviously), an egg roll and scallion noodles. The egg roll came first and it was spring rollish, in a good way. It was bigger than most spring rolls but smaller than most egg rolls.  The xlb came next. The wrapper is pretty sticky and fairly thin. I poured some vinegar over an xlb on my spoon and then devoured. The soup inside was pretty hot, though I've had way hotter. It was probably the perfect temperature for a single one though, not scalding but hot enough I had a mini panic attack the first second it was in my mouth. The subsequent dumps were way less hot though, so either I ate them too slow or just lost their heat quickly through the wrapper. They had decent flavor but I want to come back to try them them again.   The scallion noodles came last and were really good. The noodles were chewy and the sauce wasn't overpowering.  I'm definitely going to come back and try more stuff and have another pass at the xlb. I love dim sum / small plate asian places - can try so many things bc they're so cheap! For some reason, tapas style places (non Asian) usually are way more expensive per plate which defeats the purpose! Anyways i digress.  Would definitely recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Soup dumplings are to die for!! Don't miss out on these. You can also see into where they are being made fresh to order."}
{"text":"I got the spicy beef noodle soup and it really hit the spot as well. It's been so cold, I think the high today was 10 F. Being greeted with a complimentary cup of tea when I came in then this super delicious spicy soup was awesome. It had a super rich mouth feel from the oil and gelatin. Noodles were on point. The beef was fall apart tender.   Soup dumplings were delicious, though I did manage to tear two of mine accidentally and lost access to the broth. I'm going to go back to practice my technique. The skins did seem a bit thick to me, but that's really my only critique and they were still very tasty.   The owner came and talked to us. She's working her butt off with the new restaurant, and it really shows. Seriously awesome."}
{"text":"We've heard about this place because of their soup dumplings. It has taken us a few weeks to make it here.   We got an order of soup dumplings, sweet and sour ribs, and hot and spicy beef noodle soup. You can't got wrong with choosing any of the above. They were all delicious and 1 order was enough for 2 people.   The soup dumplings were the highlight. However, they are a little fragile when lifting off of the steamer so take care.   We recommend to others and we will be back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Great soup dumplings (Xiao long bao)! We got two orders of the xiao long bao, and order of the cucumbers and a spicy beef noodle soup. The xiao long baos were very authentic and tasty, very soupy/juicy. The cucumbers were pickled and  slightly spicy, very fresh, but cucumber skin was a little tough/thick. The spicy beef noodle soup was delicious, but the broth was on the oily side. The beef was tender and amazing and the noodles were very fresh (handmade?). It was a little too spicy for me. Overall, great food (and only place for xiao long bao in Cleveland probably haha).  Update: came again and tried the sweet and sour pork ribs, which was a miss. Pork Belly Noodle Soup was delicious. Xiao Long Baos still perfect."}
{"text":"A good new restaurant discovery in Cleveland this 2018.  The restaurant is big with enough seating for small parties of 2's or 4+ bigger parties.  The menu has about 20 items which is good because I find that when restaurants start to offer to many options (quality often goes to the wayside).  Cleveland has been in the single digits temperature this Winter so if you're craving a warm soup bowl for your stomach, then this is the place to try!   Complimentary jasmine green tea is served.  Most items range from $5.00 - $10.00 so affordable overall.   1. The soup dumplings are excellent.  While the dumpling skin is not thin compared to more notable soup dumpling restaurants, the pork filling and soup is flavorful and tasty.  The vinegar, soy sauce, ginger dipping sauce is available premixed at the table.  I'll definitely get this each time.   2. The scallions noodles is a dry egg noodle dish on a bed of soy sauce with very scant scallions.  However, the egg noodle is chewy but can be lack luster for those looking for a substantial dish.  3. Shrimp wonton - the broth is \"fishy\" probably due to the dry seaweed.  It was a surprising taste that I wasn't used to from other previous wonton soup dish.  I didn't finish the broth, but the shrimp wontons are excellent.  They use small-medium sized whole shrimp in the filling.   4. Shanghai flat noodle soup wasn't my fave.  The broth taste oily and bland.  The pork strips flavor was a miss as well.  The noodles was decent overall.  I'll try the dry Shanghai noodle dish next time."}
{"text":"I am Shanghainess, the soup dumplings (???) is the best! It's hard to find such local taste now even in Shanghai. I was almost tearing when I had the first bite. The chef is Shanghai Ayi, very nice! You better check out here. Yummy!!! ???????"}
{"text":"I have been hearing great things about this place so I decided that I definitely needed to check them out. There are so many awesome things about this place but lets start with the soup dumplings. You need to get these when you visit. I always love when you go a place and can tell that what your eating is homemade and this place is no exception. The dumplings were so soft and the soup and meat inside was delicious. I could have eaten two orders of them by myself. I got the spicy beef soup and they are not kidding when they say its spicy. I could eat it but it took me a little while lol. The broth was nice and fatty with the meat flavor and the noodles were phenomenal. The waitress was so friendly and very attentive. We will definitely be coming back here to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Go for the soup dumplings!  They're surprisingly good, though the skin/wrapper is not as good as Ding Tai Fung's.  Service is unfriendly and slow.  Since it just opened and is basically the only place around that serves soup dumplings, they get busy on the weekend at lunch time.  Go early to avoid having to wait in line.  The rest of the food was mediocre.  Most dishes are bland and lack depth of flavor.  The only dishes with flavor are the spicy ones, and even those don't have much beyond the heat from szechuan peppercorns.  The beef in the noodle soup was nice and tender, and the noodles have a nice texture, but things fall short on the flavor side.  I probably would not return except to bring friends who have never had soup dumplings."}
{"text":"Extremely rude servers - almost comically so. They rush you and berate you about your order, shout \"hello!\" rudely at you while you're at your table to make you move things instead of them placing dishes down properly.  The food is good (the two stars) but ultimately also isn't markedly better than any of the other numerous Asian restaurants not just in town but within walking distance. If you're feeling really nostalgic for the food, I recommend seeing if they have takeout."}
{"text":"Finally soup dumplings in Cleveland! Very authentic Shanghia-ish street food."}
{"text":"I had an awful experience in this restaurant. First of all, as a Chinese restaurant, their dishes are really not that good! Their noodles sucks! Secondly, the female boss gave us a bad service. She wanted us to move to a smaller table just because we have two people instead of three! I promise I will not go their again!! Never!"}
{"text":"I'm a little confused about this place. The star ratings were all positive, but I didn't love it. The menu was limited in my opinion. There is a lot for a meat eater, but my vegetarian friend, who normally does well with Asian cuisine was at a loss.  For her, there was only bean curd. She actually initially declined ordering anything, until they suggested bean curd. Sadly, I tried it. Let's just say it was super sweet. If that were my meal, and the only choice for a meal, I would have been very disappointed.  I ordered soup dumplings with scallion noodles. These dishes were more tasty than the bean curd. They were adequate.  The service was fair, at one point, we were dying for some water. We could see the servers engaged in conversation with each other, not very concerned about us. I guess this is not a place I will be craving and I don't have to return anytime soon. :(."}
{"text":"Love this place! We went there as a group so we could try multiple kinds of dishes. My bf got the Shanghai fried noodles and I got the \"large meat noodle soup\" (???). The fried noodles is authentic with baby bok choi and pork. The large meat is indeed large hahaha but a bit too oily. We like the Xiao Long Bao, it has enough soup in them to be close to the authenticity. Please note it's not dumpling!! It is different species: the chef has to mix pock, potentially some bok choi, chicken soup, and the key ingredient, fresh meat aspic, so that this has soup in it to be so tasteful!!! Dumpling can never be that complicated so please cherish the chef's hard work lol!!! As we are from the southern part of China we are so glad this place is open and we will visit there very often!"}
{"text":"I think I'm addicted to this restaurant. Within the past month, I have been here four times already. The soup dumplings are mouthwatering and taste amazing when dipped in chili oil. I haven't been ordering anything else besides the dumplings because they're just that good. I have tried some other dishes that my friends have ordered and they are fantastic. The food is all relatively cheap as well which is a plus for a poor college student like me.  The owner, LJ, has been my waitress a few times and provides excellent service. She is hilarious and talkative and remembers my boyfriend and I when we come. I always have a good experience here and I know I'll be coming back very soon."}
{"text":"This 5-stars recommendations is given from an Shanghainese. Go to try the food I attached."}
{"text":"The menu isn't very broad. The soup dumplings were pretty good. The eggrolls were also pretty tasty but came out a little cold in the middle. They also forgot our bbq short ribs but we just told them to forget it (politely ) and paid for our eggrolls and soup dumplings and went to Li Wah for dim sum."}
{"text":"We spent much of the day at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. We jumped on Yelp and stumbled upon LJ Shanghai. We were super excited to try soup dumplings and dim sum in Cleveland.  So what if it was a 2 mile walk? We were up for a challenge and took the hike.  Unfortunately, the menu is different from what we expected. There's really no selection of dim sum...so we had 2 orders of soup dumplings and a side of sliced cucumbers with garlic.  The soup dumplings...while very tasty...had little to no soup per dumpling. My opportunity to slurp was minimal. It was mostly chewing. The cucumbers were nice...but the picture on the menu didn't have any skins on them (I personally prefer my cukes without the skin).   The staff was super nice and welcoming. I peeked in and watched the dumplings being made by hand for a few minutes. We were there at an odd time - between lunch and dinner - so we were the only patrons.  The other stuff on the menu didn't appeal to us at the time, so we just had a snack. Was hoping for some steamed buns and other dumplings, but it sounds like they recently whittled down the menu a bit."}
{"text":"I was told we have to go here for soup dumplings. Dumpling soup? No, soup in dumplings.  Mind blown. As amazing as the dumplings are the rest of the menu is just as delicious.  Shredded pork and pickle soup. What? Yup delicious, refreshing subtle broth with tender pork and mild pickled flavor on the veg. Spicy beef noodle soup? A home run and a house specialty. Tender beef and noodles in a spicy mouth numbing broth that makes you want to dive back in.  I recommend you bring a group and enjoy all the side dishes this treasure has to offer. Hint, be adventurous. These items are on the menu for a reason.  Can't wait for my next visit.  So many flavors to explore."}
{"text":"It has been a hot minute since a new restaurant in Cleveland has made me truly excited or inspired. While we are happy that new restaurants means more choice and competition for consumers, we can also grow complacent or bored with more of the same. All this leads up to the fact that when someone mentioned to me that there was a xiaolongbao restaurant that just opened in Cleveland, I headed directly over. For those that aren't familiar, xiaolongbao is a steamed dumpling most often filled with pork and soup broth, which gives it a distinctively unique eating experience as opposed to other dumplings. While I believe it's origins are Shanghai, I was actually first introduced to it through the Taiwanese restaurant chain Din Tai Fung, which originated in Taiwan, but has spread throughout the world. Din Tai Fung is known for being a Michelin star restaurant and is also famous for having large glass windows where you can watch the expert dumpling makers carefully stuff and wrap the xiaolongbao. I say all this to say that indeed LJ Shanghai is rivaling its much bigger and well-known competitors. I didn't come here with incredibly high expectations, yet LJ Shanghai completely wowed me.   To back up a bit, the location is where Saigon Grill used to be (a restaurant that is not missed in my book) and they've retained much of the setup of the old location, but added some Chinese decor. It's very modern and comfortable and I was greeted with hot tea. I immediately ordered the xiaolongbao, but also noted that their menu is quite small and simple, which I always tend to see as a positive because it allows the restaurant to really amplify what they do best. When the xiaolongbao were brought out, I could immediately tell that they were freshly steamed and not pre-steamed then heated up which does affect the overall texture and flavor. In case I had any doubts, they have the window where you can watch staff make the dumplings just like Din Tai Fung! They also didn't cut corners here and served them with the proper condiments (soy sauce, vinegar, and hot chili if you prefer) as well as a spoon and bowl for eating (they even had a little picture guide with instructions as to how to eat them!). I cannot tell you how blown away I was with the broth inside, it was dimensional, flavorful and so much more than I could have hoped in a xiaolongbao made in Cleveland. The only thing that was missing was thinly sliced ginger to add to my sauce dish, but this did not at all detract from the flavor. I also took my server's recommendation and ordered the Spicy Beef Noodle Soup. I thought it might be similar to a Taiwanese beef noodle soup, but in fact it was more similar to cumin lamb dishes I've had at Chinese restaurants in the past. The broth is very thick and oily with a strong coriander flavor. It was filled to the brim with chunks of tender beef (a bit on the fatty side which I like, but others may be averse) as well as hand pulled noodles (am I in heaven?), steamed bok choy and chopped cilantro as a garnish. This noodle bowl was priced at $10 and was easily two portion sizes as I couldn't finish barely half. I left this restaurant full and with a renewed hope for Cleveland's food scene. I can only hope that they will continue to keep up with the fantastic quality I had on my first visit once business starts to incline, but I can't wait to recommend this truly impressive restaurant to others."}
