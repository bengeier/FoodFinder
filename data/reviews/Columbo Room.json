{"text":"I tried this place today it was excellent. I had the best fried shrimp I've ever had. The breading   was light and tasty. I also had the catfish dinner, the best catfish I've ever eaten in my life. There's a little Spice in the breading and it was perfect.
The owner dressed nicely and also was the cook.He seemed to take great care to make the food perfect.
I would definitely come back when working in this part of town."}

I'd recommend the corned beef sandwich with fries"}
{"text":"Yassssssssss!  the sandwiches are so delicious here!!! I will go here again. I don't like that it's a bar cause I definitely saw some creepers but the sandwich yes!"}
{"text":"Columbo Room is a little neighborhood bar with a small kitchen on Noble Road near the Cleveland Heights/East Cleveland border and this review is solely for the food. Not the bar.

Atmosphere is nothing remarkable. Dimly-lit, fairly dated, old school-ish watering hole with a definite older crowd, average age 55? 

NOT my scene.

But that doesn't stop me from rolling up in that piece, sneaking a seat at the end of the bar and ordering up take-out from the kitchen. Some damn good food!

Columbo Room does a mean corned beef sandwich! Wonderful! And they sell corned beef by the pound if you're interested.

The fried fish here is also really good. I usually get the orange roughy or red snapper \"sandwich.\" That's essentially a good serving of fried fish with some bread and side of slaw.

I wouldn't drive across town to come here. But if you're in this 'hood, I'd highly recommend!"}
