{"text":"Went here for the first time for lunch. Lunch specials were great, a good variety at a great price. Large menu with a lot of choices. Food was very good. Having a few craft beers on tap added to the variety. Will definitely be a repeat customer. Service and food were excellent."}
{"text":"Tried the Castle Tavern South last night. Located in an old Pizza Hut location. The restaurant was clean, the service was good and friendly. The menu was mostly pub food like Pizza, Wings, Hoagies etc... Ordered pizza and a dozen wings (spicy parm sauce). The Pizza was very good! The wings were also very good but I would like to try some of the other sauces. They have some good beers on tap and a large selection of six packs to go.. Definitely will be going back for wing night!"}
{"text":"We came here tonight for the first time and had a large group (8 adults, 8 kids.) I called ahead and even though they don't take reservations, they were very nice about accommodating our group.  When I arrived, 2 tables were waiting for us and we had 2 waitresses assigned. I wish I could remember their names, because they fell over themselves waiting on us. Best service I've ever had, no exaggeration. Drinks were replenished before we could ask, and every request was happily honored.  The food was delicious, too. We started off with the appriopriately-named killer fries. I had the sirloin steak wrap, and the steak was cooked perfectly (I asked for med-rare.) My kids liked their food too. My bill was $40, and that included 3 beers.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is an absolute favorite take out spot for our family. It's always, always good! Our favorite is the buffalo chicken wrap, but we also love the salads. The homemade ranch is incredible and everything has a very homemade flavor. The folks who take care of us are always friendly and our food is always ready on time. They have our business for a long time coming."}
{"text":"The service was very good. The food was average bar food. The Roethlesburger was just ok. The burger seemed like a frozen patty and the sausage was crumbled pizza sausage. I expected something better for the price. I would go back but wouldn't go with a burger."}
{"text":"Good food, excellent service.  Great family friendly atmosphere. Pizza is excellent and there is a very good beer selection. Nice horse shoe bar.  Great place to eat dinner or watch a game."}
{"text":"Great local bar. Order the wings and ask them to grill them. You will not be sorry and you'll be back often, because it is a unique twist on a bar favorite!"}
{"text":"Don't bother. Order was incorrect and the manager didn't care enough to address it. We felt bad for the waitress because we watched how much flack she took for it from the manager. Who, by the way, was sitting at the bar drinking while on his shift.  We won't be back and will share with our friends so they know what to expect."}
{"text":"I wanted to like it here. I was able to get a table right away and got some waters, but then it was as if we were forgotten about when it came time to order. We waited about 15 minutes to order.  Then we got 3 seconds to order with our waitress.   I decided to try the wedding soup that I heard was really good. There were no noodles in the soup, is that normal for this restaurant? I just didn't care for the soup overall. I also decided to order the pizza dip. It was lukewarm.  My fish sandwich was also not what I hoped. The bun wasn't very toasted, it affected the overall sandwich for me. The fish wasn't that fried. I couldn't eat it.  Overall the meal was awful. I felt like my server wouldn't have wanted to hear anything about how I didn't like it.  My own fault. The only thing that would mad this meal better was 50% off the bill.  I won't bother coming back again. I'm just sad I drove out of my way to ruin the night and left still hungry."}
{"text":"Ordered take out and was not disappointed! Sandwiches and wraps were excellent.  It's the buffalo chicken wrap and the chicken fajita wrap both had a little kick to them. The fries are extra crispy but not seasoned (even though the kinda look like seasoned fries). No complaints on the fries, just pointing it out."}
{"text":"Well that's that. We were huge fans of Castle Tavern in Castle Shannon and have enjoyed the South location many times, perfect place for an after baseball/softball game. Tonight's service was just slow slow slow as the owner looked on. To seal the deal as we're leaving my 6 year old touched the game on the bar and the waitress actually had the nerve to reprimand her right in front of me. Way to make a little girl cry. That's it."}
{"text":"First time here. Small place, but nice atmosphere. Bar food and great sandwiches. Good selection of draft beers. I have to say, excellent service. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"This past May I graduated college and moved to an apartment right across from Castle Tavern South. Being a recent college grad, of course I wanted a place to go unwind and have a few beers and some wings. Naturally, I walked across the street and found this place.   It's built inside of an old pizza hut, which gives it a unique feel. They have a pretty solid selection of beers that rotates monthly and include many local pittsburgh breweries, like Church Brew Works and Rivertowne. They have pretty good selection of food, its all reasonably priced, the kitchen is open late and the staff is super friendly.   What I liked most was their wings. I had the garlic parm wings and they were great! The wings themselves had just enough crisp and were smothered in a delicious sauce. They also have some daily specials that include a quarter pound burger and fries for $3. You just can't beat that.   Other than their wings and beer, there really isn't much other reason to go here despite their best attempts at being a full restaurant. I do , however, do quite often to pick up a six or twelve pack- which they have a large selection of."}
{"text":"I will usually go here when out with my mom and sisters. I find the place to be OK.   I love the Onlito's Pasta but the rest of their menu is average. We always get treated real nice by one of the servers but since we all went to school together that is no surprise. lol  The real goofy part now seems to be now that the ORIGINAL Castle Tavern has shut down that this one is still called Castle Tavern South. .... Oooooooookay. .... Whatever.   Pricing is reasonable though."}
{"text":"This place is good to come to for beer and to hang out. It does get really busy around dinner time and can some times wait a while to get seated but once you're seated, they serve your right away and get your food to you quickly."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here to watch the Penguins game Friday night since this is right down the street from his house. We arrived during the first intermission and managed to get the last two seats at the tiny,packed bar. The taps left much to be desired. They did have Cenntenial IPA so I went with that but if they hadn't had that on tap, I would have been stuck with Yuengling (which is one of my beers of last resort). Looking over the menu, it has a lot of variety but it's all just basic bar food. We decided to split a chicken quesadilla as an appetizer. Absolutely one of the worst I have ever had. Just chicken and cheese and the tortillas forming the quesadilla didn't even stay together,making the dish very \"floppy\". It was just plain,boring,and basic. But I really wasn't expecting much more that what we got. For meals, my boyfriend ordered a steak wrap with blue cheese crumbles. I ordered a greek chicken wrap (feta,tomatoes,onions,spinach,chicken). I'm not sure why they serve it with ranch dressing but there's nothing Greek about the dressing served with the wrap to me. Both came with fries that were obviously frozen. They were tolerable dipped in ranch. The wrap wasn't terrible but pretty flavorless-aside from the ranch taste from the dressing. The bartender spent more time talking to his regulars than keeping our drinks full so service wasn't great and we waited quite some time to order. It takes a lot for me to give a 1 star rating;I'd rate this experience a 1.5. Probably will not come back here or if we do, drinks ONLY and go someplace better for food."}
{"text":"Bad. Just bad. Never ever try the ranch pizza. They don't put any ranch on it whatsoever. It's just cheese on bread. The service is not that good either"}
{"text":"Just got back from there and all I can say is wow. I ordered a hot sausage sandwich. It was supposed to have cheese, onions, peppers, and sausage. I get something back with mushrooms added (I hate them) and fries melted into the cheese. Not at all as depicted in the menu.  I asked for the menu to double check that I ordered correctly....I did. The kitchen staff couldn't follow the menu. We then ask to talk to the \"manager\" . Our waitress approached him while he was sitting at the bar.   The super genius looked up from his drink long enough to express he didn't care. What he wasn't aware of is that I was sitting right behind him and watched the whole interaction He then ran outside to smoke with his buddy while the waitress handled it.    If you own this place, find a manager who will do more than drink and hang out with friends. This was like a bar rescue episode. Bottom line, bad food, a wait staff looking for leadership, and a worthless \"manager\". Honestly who shrugs off a customer and leave a waitress to deal with it? All I wanted to do is tell the guy the waitress was great, and the menu didn't reflect the food. Hope the cigarette and drinks were worth the review."}
{"text":"Tons of good food!!! Drinks are spot on and the staff amazing!!! OK I don't know what else to say other than try it out and make sure you come really hungry!!!!"}
{"text":"Built inside of an old Pizza Hut this place has a weird feel to it. It's certainly clean but it has a very bland atmosphere. The beer selection is slightly above average, but the prices were very reasonable.   Tried the jerk wings and they were fantastic, but the fries weren't that great. Service wasn't great It took a while to have our order taken and it wasn't that busy. But to be fair when my order was taken the staff was always extremely kind and our food came swiftly.   Wing night is definitely worth going for but outside of that there are definitely better bars in the area."}
{"text":"Good food for the price, friendly staff.  Found this place in the Enjoy book and decided to stop in.  Hoagies were great, pizza looked good next to us and people around us kept telling their waitresses they loved their food."}
