{"text":"The food was excellent but our service wasn't so great. The girl was nice and everything but slow. She took about 10 minutes to get us our bill and then another 10 to bring over the machine to pay. She also touched the water bottle to everyone's cups when she was refilling and that is icky."}
{"text":"Cucina is across the street from my work. I make a morning Americano trip to the coffee bar about once a week (coffee bar is situated within the restaurant - also serves take away sandwiches, yogourts and salads). I have also been there for lunch and after work drinks approximately 8 to 10 times. The inside is beautiful: French farmhouse, small but intimate. The food and wine are consistently good. I went there today and had a smoked salmon salad today with a glass of sauvignon blanc - an absolutely perfect lunch. The service is also a cut above - professional, knowledgeable, pleasant."}
{"text":"Great service and good food.  Went for dinner but it looked like it be a great place for lunch and breakfast. Can't wait to return earlier in the day.  They also serve Phil & Sebastian coffee."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to go back for diner as we used to like this place, but we were really disappointed. I believe they've recently changed the menu and the current one is not as unique and Italian-style as it used to be. We've waited for 45min to be served. When I asked if they could offer some bread as the wait was long and we were starving, the waiter agreed.... and mentioned it would be charged...  Our meals finally arrived... and mine was cold. The fries that come with the beef tartare were missing, as well as the sauce with my steak. Had to ask for water, pepper... etc!! Ended with a good tiramisu! I still like the decor, the style with the \"aged\" furniture, and the open kitchen... And if the food was \"okay\", the overall experience was deceiving. Will no longer go back."}
{"text":"One of the most overlooked and underrated restaurants in Calgary. A small, sophisticated yet comfortable decor echoes the sophisticated yet comforting food. I would go here just for the liver pâté, but everything I've tried here is delicious, from the paninis to the risottos. They also have a roasting device you can see from the dining room to devilishly tempt you with their delicious meats. It's somewhat pricey here, but you get a much better quality and better non-pasta choices here than at a typical  upscale Italian joint. Good for dates and refined get togethers."}
{"text":"Amazing! I met a friend for dinner at Cucina one evening before the Christmas holidays. We arrived at 5:00 pm, so the servers were just finishing opening up the restaurant. The space is beautiful! They don't take reservations, but arriving at 5 pm we had no trouble being seated immediately.   I had the feature beef short rib risotto and my friend ordered the porchetta. Both were fantastic. The risotto was very rich, and I ended up taking almost half of it home, making for a delicious lunch the following day. The food is on the more expensive side, but for a nice date or night out with the girls, I think the price is totally justified by both the quality and the quantity.   I would like to return during the day to check our the coffee and breakfast!"}
{"text":"Went back today earlier in the day to try one of their other sandwiches... roast beef was on my list. The place was PACKED at lunch hour in the grab & go. Sandwich was good (although I think I prefer the egg salad... too much mayo on the beef), but here's the part to take note. They have baking... croissants, scones, muffins & cookies... I caved and ordered a mudslide cookie.   I have officially been ruined for every other cookie for the rest of my life... it was the BEST COOKIE I have ever tried. Ever. Seriously."}
{"text":"Had lunch there yestreday; Went early for a table as they don't take reservations. Nice decor. The person I went with found the menu hard to read & had the waitress order his dish. The food was ok. We both had the soup de jour & both found it tasted really good but that it was under cooked, beans in it weren't cooked through. I had the crab sandwich. It was over mayo'ed."}
{"text":"Very nice little place that's easy to access!   I visited Cucina twice now and I must say that their dinner menu is better than their lunch (sandwiches)!  I found that their crab sandwich and steak sandwich both to be just lacking in dept of flavour. A little bit too simple for my tastes.   However, for dinner I ABSOLUTELY LOVED their pappardelle with meatballs! Very delicious.  The lighting does get very dim at night, so I do wish that they'd have just some brighter lights so I can see everything better.  Overall, I do recommend it!"}
{"text":"Always my favorite place for breakfast while in Calgary.  Atmosphere is great and has a French feel, always busy and food is yummy!"}
{"text":"This place simply has amazing food, great service, and is just a perfect dining experience every time I go there. The food is all good, I keep trying different things, and the dishes never disappoint. I would recommend this place to anyone that loves good food, good atmosphere, and great service. AAA+++ I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Late last week my boyfriend told me that Teatro's opened a new bistro - Cucina, which is accessible via the +15. Today we went there with a friend to have dinner.  Cucina is a quaint restaurant. When you first enter the area the decor is rustic, with a clean display of dried meats behind a glass cabinet and a sandwich menu board in front of the sandwich bar. Further inside the decor becomes more classy with antique looking lights that hang down from the ceiling; there is also a water, milk, and cream tap which served its purpose and was a cute addition. The dim lighting added a more stylish feel. A negative aspect to the restaurant was the disconnecting background music and the floor tiles, which did not fit in with the rest of the decor.   Most people who dined at Cucina wore business casual attire which made the restaurant feel more 'upscale'. Cucina could probably fit groups of 8 people, however I think it comfortably fits groups of 2-4. The seating space inside appears to be a bit tight, people were almost elbow to elbow. Unfortunately this place does not take reservations, so it is probably difficult to dine in larger groups.   The menu items are a bit more pricey than your average Earl's restaurant, but definitely cheaper than Teatro's - money was definitely well spent here. The food dishes may appear to be small, but the portions are more than enough. Our waitress Andrea was very attentive, polite and very helpful in giving us food suggestions. I would definitely say that I had a great experience at this restaurant and that I would recommend it to friends.  Food wise, we ordered the Alberta Rib Eye, the Saltimbocca Pasta Shells and the Manitoba Market Fish for dinner. And for dessert we ordered the Passionfruit Mousse and the Reverse Affogat.    The Alberta Rib Eye (12 ounces) came with crispy potato, pan-roasted brussel sprouts, smoked paprika aioli and topped with caramelized onion-grainy dijon jus. The rib eye was perfectly cooked to medium rare. The meat was tender and juicy. The flavouring was light, but still prominent enough to taste. Additionally, caramelized onions added a hint of sweetness to the flavour. Next, Saltimbocca Pasta Shells were filled with braised short rib, sage, and veal juice. The shells were not over cooked and were perfectly done. The shell kept the meat in place and once in your mouth the stuffed meat just melted. Finally, the Manitoba market fish was the feature fish. It was served with gnocchi and broccolini. The fish was tender and its crispy thin skin added a nice touch to the dish. The Manitoba market fish was lightly flavoured allowing one to taste the flavour of the fish. Overall, these dishes were phenomenal and I like all three of them!!!  Dinner was definitely filling, but of course there is always room for dessert!! The Passionfruit Mousse we ordered was topped with passionfruit jelly and fresh grapes (it said fresh raspberries on the menu...but I guess they didn't have any). The passionfruit flavour is very bold and tart making this a very refreshing dish. I thought this dessert would be too sweet, but the tartness of the passionfruit made it perfect. The Reverse Affogat that we ordered was a house made espresso gelato glazed with warm vanilla bean cream. The espresso was very bold in flavour that just explodes in your mouth. However, this was complemented by the vanilla bean cream which adds a creamy taste to the espresso and tones it down slightly.   Delicious!!"}
{"text":"If you are like me and have been cooking delicious comfort foods for many many years and consider yourself pretty picky now, this is the place for you!    They make THE best risotto and all the other dishes are sprinkled with all the seasonal ingredients I'm usually craving so it's always hard to choose.  They make a chicken pâté that is to die for, today there was a Ragu pasta which is my favourite, and everything is always seasoned perfectly!  I'm always trying to get hints of their recipes (mascarpone is the secret to the risotto BTW).  I gave up eating out for Italian years ago for the most part but I've never had a bad meal here and I would definitely give this a try if you haven't yet! All the Italian food you normally don't get in everyday restaurants are executed really well, from pan fried sweet potato gnocchi to the fire roasted quails.  PS If you work nearby, their croissants and coffee are delicious for breakfast as well."}
{"text":"Two colleagues have frequented the market/grab & go part of Cucina and rave about the sandwiches so they wanted to try the bistro for a sit down lunch and I was totally for it.  Space is really limited, even in the \"dining\" side they've only managed to squeeze in about 5 or so tables. We got seated right by the street entrance door, and although heavy drapes and a heater were set up HUGE blasts of cold wind would come barreling through whenever anyone opened the door. This was really irritating and it got worse as it got busier - there wasn't an option to move tables :(  Our server was really great, she read us the specials, gave suggestions and even checked with the chef for gluten free options for my celiac colleague. We all settled on the specials - two orders of pan seared Scallops and one order of the pork roast.  We started with the pear and prosciutto salad - it was good, nothing too amazing.  My scallops arrived and the aroma had me drooling! The perfectly cooked scallops were topped with a cream sauce reduction with mushrooms and potatoes, the chunks of grapefruit and springs of arugula were a refreshing touch!   It is a bit pricey for lunch, our dishes were around $30 each. So if you're willing to splurge I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"We are in Calgary for the night and had no idea where to go. After looking on Yelp and Open Table for Italian we decided in Cucina. Now I just wish I didn't live 1300 miles away!  It was delicious!! The Prosciutto e Burrata is not to be missed. For my main course I had the Saltimbocca and the short ribs melted in my mouth. Such a great dinner!!"}
{"text":"I am wavering on my stars for this one...somewhere between a 3 and a 4. I will definitely give them another try to see if they can hit the 4 stars.  I went here for lunch with a friend. We sat at the little bar which was nice - the chairs were very tall and narrow which took some getting used to. The bar is a pretty high traffic area so there was always movement around us. You do get used to it though.  Pros:  * Great location, easy to get to * Nice décor. I love the style and the little details they have like the collector spoons they serve with coffee. Very old school * Menu is pretty extensive for such a teeny place with great descriptions * The food looked great and was plated with care * Service was pretty quick and very polite   Cons  * I had a coffee after lunch...it was kind of watery and  wasn't as great as I expected it would be * Noise: Wow was it loud in there. Like 8th Ave mid-day seemed quiet when we stepped outside after. I am glad we sat at the bar or else conversation would have been impossible. * Crowded: I get maximizing tables in there but you can hardly move without being in someone's space. Like really in their space. * The bartender/our server seemed stressed. He was very polite but seemed worried. The whole time. * The entrance area is crowded. You walk in and you are practically walking over people at the first table behind the curtain.  In between:  * The food...my friend had the fish special. It looked great and she said it was delicious. I had the crab baguette. Initially I loved how fresh the crab tasted...there was something so bright to it. But it didn't seem to taste exciting all the way through. There was also to much baguette to filling ratio for my liking * I felt like things were a little over priced...some, not all, for what you were getting. I don't mind paying for a great meal...this was okay. I also don't mind paying for ambiance or the experience...but again I thought it was just \"okay\".  Hopefully I will have the occasion to go back, and maybe try them for breakfast or dinner. I do appreciate maybe I chose the wrong menu item and  that they might be more than \"okay\" with other meals/dishes."}
{"text":"Great first time experience here. Went for a later dinner on sat night. Tried some unique dishes of the rabbit pasta and sweet bread market risotto. Delicious despite first initial thoughts. Also tried the bison tartare and duck which was perfectly balanced in taste and texture. Ended with the family recipe of tiramisu and upside down corn rhubarb cake with pistachio ice cream and candied pistachios."}
{"text":"Wonderful lunch, linguine carb. And l a wonderful Pfeiffer white wine, suggested by my beautiful server. Great pairing. I have come to Cucina several times over the last 3-4 years, and have never been disappointed. Yes it is a little pricey, but well worth it.  I really enjoy that they change there menu on a regular basis, so it's always a nice surprise to find something new.  Breakfast was always enjoyable, but to be honest, I have not been in months, because it is pricey, but having said that, some very good, and different ways to enjoy, what can be, a fairly basic meal. But they are far from the norm.  They have a wonderful, albeit small patio, on the shady side of the street, so the weather really needs to be nice.  Servers and management is very nice, professional, we'll versed in the specials of the day, and not in you face, but easily available, if you need them.  The coffee/barista, bar is excellent, with a great selection of treats, if you want to stop between breakfast and lunch for a coffee break or meeting. But be prepared to move by 11ish, so they can prepare for their lunch crowd. Having said that, lunch isn't as busy as it has been in the past, mainly because of the economy i sure.   The year couples you would need to book at least a week in advance, maybe a day or two now!! Or if you can, come a little later, always tables or small bar available."}
{"text":"I decided to try Cucina after work on a Friday night with a few ladies. Everything on the menu looked fantastic but I narrowed it down to the gnocchi and the risotto, with a glass of sangria to accompany my meal. The food was really fantastic and I can't wait to go back to try the other offerings. I haven't had much luck with sangria in restaurants lately (usually watered down, too sweet, not enough fruit, etc.), but Cucina's version was delicious and my two glasses went down too easily. Service was friendly and fast, but you'll definitely need reservations as this place was pretty full by the time we finished our meal."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and have enjoyed myself every time! The decor is classy and quaint, and is definitely one of my go to spots for a special occasion. I like that the food is not overly expensive, despite the quality and the location. The service is also great as well, they check on you often (but not too often) and I am always greeted by someone who offers to take my coat.  My favourite dish here is definitely the oyster mushroom risotto that comes with the free range chicken breast entree. Super rich And yummy! They have a rotating market risotto as well.   The only appetizer I've tried here are the arachini which is breaded mushroom risotto balls with a sun-dried tomato aioli. Long story short I am a huge fan of their risotto. They also have an extensive wine list as well, and half off bottles of wine M-F 3-6pm."}
{"text":"Perfect for our recent date night.  Great little spot, interesting menu, delicious ingredients and attentive but not too \"familiar\" service.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of eating here yesterday with a dear friend. It was her suggestion and I was so happy for it - I didn't even know Cucina existed. Now, I'm definitely a fan. With the lovely glass of wine and great company, this was definitely a notable lunch for me.  I loved the simple table settings and the natural light coming in from the large windows. The menu was one simple page, however, it still had a great variety.  My friend chose the panini, and I had the Romaine Insalata. The food was served quickly and looked fantastic. I chose this salad for the roasted pork belly and parmesan. Fresh, full leaves of romaine dressed lightly, with a few that had collected a little more (I really loved those ones...I'm a saucy girl!) What really surprised me was how much I enjoyed the marinated anchovies!    I will definitely be back. Next time, perhaps, I will try something from the grab & go market on the other side of the room.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So after watching Top Chef Canada last night and seeing the fancy-pants dishes the chefs were creating on TV, I realized my homecooked lazy dinner wasn't going to cut it. The bucket of popcorn the fiance and I devoured filled us up a bit, but we definitely needed some proper food.  SOME FANCY FOOD.  We decided to try Cucina because it was close by and was on our list to try for a while.  We arrived around 8:30pm, and they seated us right away because the restaurant wasnt too busy. We told the waitress we werent that hungry, so we ordered just one appetizer and one main dish to share.  The appetizer we got was the Vitello Tonnato. Thinly sliced veal drizzled with ttuna confit emulsion and topped with fried crispy capers and arugula. It was steep at $14 for a small portion, but the flavour was there. Everything worked so well together in every bite. The softness of the veal worked well with the crispy capers, and the sharpness of the caper was balanced by the tuna emulsion. Really tasty way to start!  For our main, we got the Beef Osso Bucco. Thank GOODNESS we got one to share because this was MASSIVE! Believe me when I say that the size of this beef shank was bigger than my head and there would be NO WAY I could finish that by myself. The beef shank was sitting on a jus and creamy polenta, and was topped with a gremolata. The beef was soft on some parts, and a bit dry in some other parts, but nonetheless it was great when dipped in the jus. Perfect size for two, we finished it and were both comfortably full.   The interior of the restaurant was really cool - they got the 'bistro' feel just right. Their attention to detail was also great because they even gave you tiny little spoons to use to scoop out the bone marrow :)  Good addition to the food scene in Calgary!"}
{"text":"So excited to have a good y'all close to home! They are getting used to the system and the crowds. We went to Press Waffle co and the Swarma bar. The food is delicious!   Press Waffle Co-I think the waffles are the best waffles I've eaten. They are lovely, crispy (from the crystallized sugar in the batter) and holds their toppings really well. We ate at the swarma bar first and then took our waffles home. I assumed they would be a little soggy but NO! They held up. So glad I took mine home or I would have ordered another.  The Swarma bar-food was fresh and so good. I love a good gyro and it didn't disappoint. I will try the Moroccan mint tea next time. Moroccan tea is super sweet and I loved it when I was in Morocco."}
{"text":"*This review relates just to the take out section and not the Dine-in.  I went to Cucina at 10:53 AM on a Monday. I saw the display counter and saw that there was a Mediterranean veggie Focacia which I ordered. The guy at the counter told me that Since it is not 11 AM we cant serve it to you (this is a sandwich that has been made and is sitting in the display shelf just to be heated). Then I said, can I order the Egg Fritata Breakfast panini? and he said that we can serve you that since its past 10:30 AM and there is no breakfast past that point.    I just stood there dumbstruck as this was the first esstablishment that I went to that was not willing to take my money. It was very awkward as the manager was standing close to the cashier/barista and was completely oblivious to the situation and did not even bat an eye.   All in all it was a very disappointing visit and would not recommend this establishement not because of the quality of food but a terrible display of service."}
{"text":"I would have given Cucina a higher review based on their brunch, but unfortunately they don't do it anymore! It's a shame because it was one of the best brunches I've had in Calgary (they did these amazing ricotta fritters). Anyway, popped in for coffee with friends the other day and we decided to get some appies. Ambiance is great! Very open, clean and bright. They don't really have much besides a cheese board in the way of sharing appies (which is problematic in a place on Stephen ave I think). We decided to split the 3 way bruschetta. That was a mistake, instead of coming with many toasts as we thought it just had three and it was difficult to cut up. It was also expensive for just 3 bits of toast with some toppings (like $16). The duck prosciutto was really good, but the olive + anchovy bruschetta was just like eating a bowl of mushy salt. I'm a huge olive lover and salty food fan but it was just too much. Pair salty things with creamy light things to balance out the taste! The last one, some sort of cheese bruschetta was just ok. Would not order that again. The coffee is excellent and the soup my friend ordered was very tasty. The price, menu for sharing starters and the one we had kept me from giving it a better review. I have had excellent meals here though and will return (praying they do brunch again!)."}
{"text":"I'm loving Cucina!  It is definitely worth the little jaunt from my office in Bankers Hall.  I haven't been to Starbucks in a couple of weeks - I've been coming here almost every day.  There are not crazy line-ups like at Starbucks or Cafe Artigiano!  (Shhhh!  Please keep this a secret!)  It's nice to have an alternative for coffee - they brew Phil & Sebastian - and healthy little treats as well.  Their food is also delicious - I've only had food to go, but their Rotisserie Chicken Sandwich is great!  Wonderful fresh ingredients!  My only comment - and this is partly due to Eighth Avenue Place being under more construction with the 2nd tower going up - is that they need some spots to sit and drink your coffee if you're getting it to go.  Even having some little bistro tables outside in the lobby would be nice."}
{"text":"Awesome bacon breakfast sandwich!  Easily the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had.  Slight problem is that it is only on the takeout menu and doesn't appear on the sit down menu.  If you perservere with your waitress she'll let you order it anyway at your table (usually).  Cucina is very small so make sure you make a reservation unless you just want take-out.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Highly recommended. Their full order portion is bigger than I thought. We ordered seafood pasta, there is a lot of seafood and fresh, and risotto with pork belly, the pork belly are done prefect. Finished off with an amazing tiramisu."}
{"text":"Popped in here for lunch with friends on a trip down to Canmore.   Sure glad we did. Had a mushroom/panchetta pasta. Absolutely 10 of 10 on the tasty scale. Pasta cooked perfectly (This shouldn't be a big deal as it should be a minimum) with a crazy flavourful mushroom/panchetta sauce. Accompanied by a very boozy and fantastic Negroni.   Upon moving to Calgary, this will be a regular spot for sure."}
{"text":"As the only place I take clients to for breakfast downtown, I'd like everyone to know the reason...because this place not only has the best breaky in town but the staff (Terra) is absolutely amazing!!!   If you're looking for a beautiful decor, locally grown eats, friendliest staff, decent prices, the best coffee and a place where you can hear your own conversation then this is where you must go immediately!!  It's kind of cozy but that's part of the charm! I wish there were more of these restaurants in Calgary but then they'd have to try and clone the staff too...love it here!!"}
{"text":"Cucina Market Bistro has definitely set the bar when it come to classy Italian dining. I came across Cucina randomly when I was perusing on the Big Taste of Calgary website. Their dinner menu line up secured my need to secure my reservation when I was visiting.   I was so pleasantly surprised when our party of 3 walked in and we were greeted immediately by one of the staff. He was in the midst of preparing our table and asked if we could just hang tight. The place smelled wonderful and every table was packed. I would not say it is overly big so I think reservations are definitely recommended. The decor was super modern with a combined taste of European shabby chic as well. I LOVED the dinner tables which had wooden plaques of wine labels on them.   As part of the Big Taste of Calgary 2016 Menu, I ordered the leek and zucchini bisque with creme fresh to start. The soup tasted wonderful and it excited my palate for what was to come. The braised lamb shank with fregola sarda (type of pasta) and root vegetables also did not disappoint. The meat literally was so tender that it fell off the bone. The flavors were all perfectly paired together. By the end of this meal, I wanted to lick the plate but then I was reminded that I was a lady (hahaha). The tiramisu wrapped up this meal very nicely and left me more than satisfied!   My partner had ordered from the Big Taste menu as well but the opposite of what I had so we would both have a samples of everything. He started with the heirloom tomato salad with celery hearts and aged balsamic dressing topped with goat cheese. His 2nd course was the sweet potato gnocchi with oyster mushrooms and kale in this delicious chutney. Dessert was chocolate coconut budino (pudding). I have to say everything was overwhelmingly good and I must come!  Our meal each was $35 off the Big Taste Menu and we added wine pairing with each course for only $20 and each (each pairing was 5 oz)."}
{"text":"I recently came back to Cucina to catch up with a friend, and for the first time ever I strayed from their pastas and had the \"pork belly\".   I use the quotations because instead of a square of pork belly with crispy skin, I was instead served what looked more like a rolled pork centerloin cut that was dry and tough. This unfortunate piece of meat was accompanied by an equally unfortunate scoop of greasy cubed veggies and potato, which were dripping with grease and tasted more like a Denny's than a proper restaurant - all for about $25 (which is pricey for lunch!)   That was definitely a 2-star experience but I'm adjusting my review to 4 stars on account of all the positive pasta experiences that I've had at this restaurant."}
{"text":"A solid lunch spot with excellent pasta. Service was ok and prices were slightly on the higher side."}
{"text":"Had the trout special and cherry pie.  Both were delicious.  Thr trout was cooked perfectly.  Perfect place for a business lunch and reservations are necessary."}
{"text":"Had dinner here on a weeknight.  Enjoyed the ambiance and decor, tables are a little bit on the small and squished side.  Tables close to the door are quite breezy and with the high ceilings it was a bit cold.  Shared a small soup (carrot ginger) and a beet with goat cheese salad to start. The carrot ginger soup was good, however it was overly salty likely as a result of sitting on the warmer and became too concentrated. Beet and goat cheese salad was the highlight.  There was some fabulous pesto on the side which was great.  For our primi, we decided on the risotto (mushroom, fennel topped with fried pork belly).  This was also too salty, but the taste, texture and creaminess were great.    For our secondi, we ordered the porchetta.  The flavor was good and the pork was not overcooked.  The pesto on the side went with the pork.    Overall good meal.  Food was generally a bit too salty.  The prices are on the high side for what you get.  Would probably go to Sauce on pasta nights to get my Italian cravings sated."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a colleague and I ordered: Arancini (mushroom, sundried tomato aioli) Conchiglie Saltimbocca (braised short rib stuffed shell, crispy prosciutto)- small comes in 3 and large comes in 5  I was definitely amazed at the food and service was not bad. So the Arancini was delicious. I would say you don't need that much sauce. If you add too much sauce it becomes a bit salty. But the sauce was not bad. The Conchiglie Saltimbocca was amazing. Portion looks small for 3 but its enough for myself.   The restaurant is very small and you basically need to make a reservation. They have the restaurant split with one part operating as café and offers breakfast items.  Overall, I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"So here's the deal:  Good food, great interior decorating and fun atmosphere.  I may be inclined to go back there when they have more wait staff on.... You see, I, along with 3 others took in a movie just down the street at the Globe Cinema during CIFF and decided this eatery would be a wonderful addition to the already super evening.  It would have been....if we planned to spend just under 3 hours there... there were only two servers and our server told us they weren't prepared for such an onslaught of diners.  My first thought was \"It's Friday night, I made a reso because it's Friday night in YYC and EVERYBODY goes out to din din on Friday night. I kept the thought politely to myself and got to know the 3 others I was dining with.   If you've got the time and the dime, eat here as it was incredibly tasty.  Just took a loooong time to get seated, get our bottle of wine, and our after dinner espressos - our food came out within the appropriate time though.   And the service was friendly - our server did her best for sure.   I had the risotto and that evening it was bacon, zucchini and leek and it was splendid. The others ordered pork belly which looked good, bruschetta was fabulous and the tomato soup was deemed good as well."}
{"text":"Calgary Big taste dinner on Tuesday night with my dear friend Deb again. Excellent service. Amazing food...warm, cozy ambience.  We started with red wine and a risotto ball. It was tasty but I have yet to taste an arancini that blows my mind enough to order it twice.  Shared the squash soup which had a beautiful velvety Indian spiced flavour.  Definitely a winner!  Next up the gnocchi with mushrooms and lamb. The lamb was gamier than expected but that's a matter of preference. It was very tender and the gnocchi were perfect with a light sauce. I wish I did not have to share!  This is the BEST gnocchi dish I've had in the city to date.  Being married to an Italian, my gnocchi standards are very high. Next up the fish that had a good crust to the seared skin and a tasty mixture of puréed beans underneath. I was less enthused about the fish and unlikely to order it the next time I return.   Finally, dessert. I had to take extra lactaid pills as one was a berry cheesecake which was fabulous and the other was tiramisu which was uneventful for my tastebuds. Overall, this was an awesome way to try a new resto and I will definitely return. If the gnocchi is indicative of the other pasta dishes, I may be in love!!!  Be well and eat well my fellow Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Finally - a modern cafe and resto with great service, modern ambience, and good coffee. Breakfasts are always good - eggs, oatmeal, specials. Just like something you'd find in melbourne."}
{"text":"Chicken and Waffle Benedict.   How do you even come up with that? It's ingenious.   I was attracted to Cucina because I noticed that they have squid ink pasta in the menu. Thinking that Saturday lunch would be a good choice...wrong. On the weekend it is brunch menu until dinner time, so if you wanted to try something from the regular menu, be warned.   Though I didn't get to try the squid ink pasta, going for the brunch was a blessing in disguise. The Chicken and Waffle Benedict is a very interesting take on the classic Benedict and the Belgian waffles. I will go back again, but for dinner and for the squid ink.   The seating is designed for a summer patio experience being on 8 Avenue. Cucina is best enjoyed on a sunny day, especially if you like people watching."}
{"text":"I had an awesome meal with my boyfriend tonight! The service was amazing, thanks Megan! Great flank steak and wonderful Cornish hen. Beautiful experience"}
{"text":"I was in Calgary for work and looked up breakfast spots on Yelp.  The good reviews are what brought me here.  I ordered basic egg whites with bacon and toast, but then I saw a side dish that caught my eye - crispy gnocchi hash with green onion!  I had to order it and I am so happy I did.  The overall meal was really good, but the gnocchi was awesome.  That made the whole meal a treat.  The restaurant itself is really cute and was busy with take-out breakfast orders, clearly a popular place.  The only reason I am giving it three stars though is because of the service.  For those that were seated, they only had one gal on hand and she is not the most cheerful.  She seemed bothered.  She never came to refill my water and I was going to ask for hot sauce or ketchup and decided not to, didn't want to annoy her any further.  Other than that, a  great place and I wish I could have been there long enough to try dinner there."}
{"text":"Um, delicioso?   Picture eating a meal inside the ANTHROPOLOGIE Store in Chinook and you have CUCINA.  Located on 8th avenue near THE CORE, Cucina is an Italian restaurant that's actually quite quaint and enjoyable.  The furniture is kind of aged and gorgeous and the kitchen is wide open for all to see.  My cousin was in town from the Land of the Newfs and we HAD to bring him somewhere new and fresh.  They have a great beer menu bringing in lots of different bottles from around the world, and everyone was very much enjoying their wine selection.  Everyone with us loved this place so much.  The Anti-Pasti plate is a MUST to start and share!  Delicious cheese, meats and olives.  The Blue Cheese was served with this organic honeycomb which is the perfect offset for a strong cheese like that.  Very smart, and very delicious.  I finished with the vegetarian risotto (which was the special that night) while everyone seemed to have ordered the short-rib stuffed shells and devoured them.  I made a mistake!!!!  ORDER REMORSE! For dessert we shared the ANTI-PASTI Lemon and it was amaaaaze baaaalllllls.  Little slices of cakes with a passionfruit drizzle.  A Pot de Crème that seriously tasted like lemon meringue pie, and a pistachio pâté that tastes like fudddggggge.  There was a Tiramisu going around too that was creamy and to die for.  A great spot to come and eat at about $50/person, you'll have a great time no matter what the occasion."}
