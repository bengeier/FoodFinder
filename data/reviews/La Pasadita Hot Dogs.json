{"text":"Great food! Tacos and chihuahua hot dog was bomb. Quesadilla was delicious. Will eat here again and will definitely try the 83rd ave location."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. I ordered fresas con creme here and the strawberries were frozen it was literally a raspado. I should have know better since it's a hot dog place but I thought I'd give them a try. Save your money."}
{"text":"I love coming here! I have tried everything. My late night craving is the elote here with the Limon and Chile mmmmm. Horchata is always on point too."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The Sonoran dogs are delicious and you can also get a variety of other dogs, Like, Sinaloa, Chihuahua, and Arizona. Try them all, I think they are about $3 a dog. They don't only have hot dogs though, they have carne asada fries which you can order in a variety of ways too! Burritos & other stuff but I don't really gravitate toward those, I go here for the Sonoran dogs.  I'm telling you this place is awesome. I just tried El Güero Canelo place that just opened up in Phoenix, it did not live up to its hype. It tasted just like the Sonoran dogs I get at La Pasdita, but Güero was a bit overpriced. I gave it 4 stars because of the location, can be shady..."}
{"text":"I've had Sonoran hot dogs in Sonora, Tucson, and the Phoenix area. So far, these have been the best I've found in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Small place with a HUGE menu! Everything tasted amazing and I'll definitely be going back every chance I get!"}
{"text":"Friendly ppl and great food I would highly check them out this our 5 time visiting? them and every time is like the first time"}
{"text":"Very good hotdog, best I've had in Phoenix. Seeing how this is a Sonoran hotdog, I have to compare them to hotdogs from the capital of Sonora, Hermosillo (called dogos there). What makes the hotdog is the bread, which is very flavorful even on its own. I give it 4 stars because in my opinion, the sausage is too small for the bread, and Sonoran hotdogs usually have bacon wrapped around the sausage (these don't). Also, if you're not familiar with the area, it might turn you off as it is located in a rowdy part of town, and many of the customers look like they're always dealing something (expensive trucks with 24\" rims, 2 males watching each other's backs, weary expression, arrogant demeanor).   The main attraction here is the hotdog, but they have a vast variety of other items like raspados (Mexican smoothies, coctel de elote (corn coctail- very good), tostitos with cheese and/or pico de gallo (tomato, cucumber, etc).  If you get the hotdog, ask for everything except beans, because in my opinion it takes away from the favor, and NO KETCHUP, as how it is eaten in Hermosillo. And always, ALWAYS accompany with a Mexican bottled coke (you're welcome)."}
{"text":"The tortilla soup is good. The carne asada burros are good. Overall the food is good, but a bit pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Really good food, location isn't the best. Semi permanent food truck that stays open until midnight."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have not write a review yet.  This is become one of my favorite hotdog places. I love the sonorina I think that's the one the one with the chips on top.  Usually we get there combo deal he gets the one he likes and I get that hotdog the price is good the fries are not too bad."}
{"text":"Gosh, I loooooooove this place! Everything they make is on point. I have never had a bad experience at this place and I have been here over 15 times."}
{"text":"Just spent 20 minutes waiting when there was only two cars at the drive thru. Ordered 2 Sinaloa hot dogs with no mustard and 2 chihuahua hot dogs with no guacamole. Apparently that was to difficult of a order. They even added a extra ingredient, Hair on one of the hot dogs. Last time I ever come here"}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to visiting this place after I read yelp's reviews. Once we arrived, well things changed. My son's Sonoran's hotdog was edible. Mine, Sinaloa's hotdog, was quite the opposite. The bread was way too soggy and the hotdog seemed to be sitting in the warmer for a couple of days. The Ruffles potato chips, that serve as a garnish, were stale. Oh and did I mention that I made a slight change to my hotdog order (no mayo) and was charged $1.00 extra! Overpriced hotdogs....period!"}
{"text":"Muy buena la comida, el servicio y sobre todo los precios.  Lo único que sí necesitan mejorar es en la limpieza, estaba muy sucio el comedor.  Échenle ganas pasadita...   F.Y.I Their forte are the typical Mexican hot dogs"}
{"text":"I ordered the coctel de elote and was soooo disappointed! I got a cup full of water and corn with a sprinkling of cotija cheese but it was more water than corn. That's it. No crema, no mayo, no butter, no salsa. A little cup with red chile powder that was so salty it ruined it even more. The man that sells the corn on the corner puts more effort into his product than this place! Never again!"}
{"text":"Had 2 Sonoran hot dogs, which were solid but a little small. It was just right for me at the time as I wanted to save space for another meal on my road trip.  Dining area is small, bathrooms could use some care as there were no toilet seat covers and a bunch of graffiti was all over the inside of the stall."}
{"text":"Customer service is terrible. Place is dirty. Never had their tacos but their hot dogs are mediocre. Low quality and very bland. If you want a good Sonoran hot dog, go to any hot dog stand in South Phx!"}
{"text":"Everything tastes good. Cheese fries, Sonoran bacon wrapped hot dogs with onions and mayonnaise and peppers, carne asada tacos....it's all bomb. cheap too"}
{"text":"I was in the area for work and stopped in for lunch. The reviews were positive and being from Chicago I've been craving a good hotdog. I ordered a Sonoran and a regular in the event that I wasn't a fan of their toppings. In general, the hotdogs were low quality and flavorless. The Sonoran loaded with toppings was also a flavorless blob of nothing. The small side of fries were old and poorly seasoned. Summary: was hoping for better based on reviews but didn't share the same opinion , your experience may be better"}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is amazing. From the Sonoran hot dogs, to the carne asada fries. Nice atmosphere, outside, since it is a taco truck. Fairly quick to get your orders out. I've been coming here for years and it never disappoints! Can I give this place 10 stars? No okay. So I'll give it 5."}
{"text":"When it comes to Sonoran Hot Dogs, this is the place to be! Having lived in the area for a short time, I've come to La Pasadena for the variety of Sonoran dogs, as well as the ginormous order of Carne Asada fries. Monday through Thursday, there are also specials on the dogs. They also have Mexican Coke, horchata, and other goodies for a fair price. I suggested this place to friends visiting from back home in Sacramento, and they were not at all disappointed in La Pasadena!"}
{"text":"Sonora hot dog it is a must to try.  They have parking plenty space to eat.and they accept credit cards. They hot dogs are amazingly good."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place. Must try the carne asada fries with the Arizona dog. This is certainly a great meal. If you're a veteran Don't forgot to show your Military ID for 50%off."}
{"text":"This place is not what I expected! They have a sign advertising \"No ticket free food\" well my wife pointed out the sign as we where eating and I realized I never recieved a Ticket  (receipt). I approached the cashier and explained that he had not given me a Ticket. He then looked around and found the ticket and handed it to me. I pointed out the sign to him. He just told me don't matter I just gave you your receipt. Wow! Guess we should of known better. Why advertise if you are not going to honor and follow thru! I will definately pass this on to friends and family.....False Advertising! !"}
{"text":"I have to say I was a little skeptic about this place due to the location and how small it is. However, I don't know how I lived so long without it !!! The flavors in the food are so diverse. I got 2 Estilo Chihuahua hot dogs which contain tomatoes onions beans cheese bacon salsas and mustard with a toasted bun. Honey got a carne asada quesadilla and 4 carne asada tacos and he thought they were really good but said the tacos could have been better. I loved this place it's small and delicious. The only thing that I wished was different is if the carne asada wasn't so dry And they should have a better condiment bar."}
{"text":"Small, packed, line out the door. It has all the tell tale signs of a great hole in the wall restaurant. I ordered the Sonoran dog and the asada torta. Food took about 15 minutes to get which is nothing given that it was really busy. Once it arrive I dived right into the torta first which was delicious. Next came the Sonoran dog, and boy did it deliver. Explosion of flavor with just the right amount of kick. Worth the 40 minute drive to get here, luckily I was already on this side of town!"}
{"text":"They are hand down the best hot dogs i have tried in Phoenix! My favorite one was the sinaloa one, and my Boyfriend loved the chihuhua one! Will come back for more!"}
{"text":"I am a Sonoran Dog  fanatic.  Fa-na-tic! Have dog,  will travel.   My husband and I drove 20 miles to five this place because it was a Sonoran dog kind of day.  We had to travel to this location from the 32nd street location because it was really dirty with chicken laing on the ground in the parking lot.  Eww.  We ordered a traditional Sonoran, a Sinoloa and papas. Let's start with the good.  The papas were mashed potatoes with butter, sour cream,  queso cotija, and asada. Holy S*** was it delicious!   The Sinoloa was a sonoran dog with cheese and Lays cheddar cheese on top of it all.  There was too much stuff on top, throwing the bun, dog and topping ratio off balance.  The same could be said of the other dog. Too many tomatoes threw the taste off.  I took at least half a cup of them off of the top.   I walked out of the store sad, and regretting passing my favorite dog stand for this place.  Oh well,  you live and you learn."}
{"text":"I like there carne Asada fries. All hot dogs are delish. Pretty quick. My daughter is a picky eater and she likes the carne asada fries here."}
{"text":"The hot dogs are awesome. Whichever estillo you choose and the people here are pretty friendly."}
{"text":"Yum yum Yum!! The absolute best street tacos I have ever tasted.  A hole in the wall restaurant featuring hot dogs with some Mexican entree's. Very clean. I will stop anytime. Had the tacos twice and will be back to try hot dogs!"}
{"text":"Once you've had a Sonoran Dog from El Guero Canelo in Tucson, you'll do anything to recreate the experience.  I've been looking for a good Sonoran Dog since I moved back to Phoenix 10 years ago and I came to La Pasadita in my quest.  Their Sonoran Dog was just okay, the wiener was small and overcooked.  The star of the show is definitely the creamy corn cocktail.  The service is outstanding, they make you feel their gratitude for your business."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with this location and customer service.  The skinny  After a long day at work my gf decided they were going to have sushi for an early dinner and as a non sushi eater they asked what I would like to eat I naturally I selected one of my fav go to spots and finding out they had a closer location was a plus. The hot dogs were ok beans tasted old and was not very warm the cheese tasted like they may use a cheaper cheese than 83rd ave location. The chips they use to top hot dogs tasted stale.  The bad  As soon as you walk in to location u get a foul smell as if they use dirty smelly rags to clean table my gf and daughter couldn't take the smell and waited outside. When I walked in I also was not acknowledged I take it as they thought I was looking at menu but really they should have asked or greeted me and I could have ordered quicker but she decided to take 2 drive through orders before coming to me. The hot dogs were not good and I didn't have my usually great experience I will not come back to this location and travel further out to 83rd ave to get better service and better food."}
{"text":"If your looking for a great hot dog this is a place to try.  The food/service/atmosphere I ordered the Sonoran and chihuahua hot dogs and both were so good the Sonoran has mayo ketchup guacamole a jalapeño relish with nacho cheese and ruffles queso chips on top, the other had bacon with cheese ketchup mayo jalapeño relish and onions. Both are amazing the staff was friendly but this place is not the fastest (great food takes time) my gf who is vegetarian ordered the plain nachos they had jalapeño nacho and Mexican powder cheese with a Mexican sour cream and beans they were awesome a little small but great. The place was small and had about 6 tables inside and shared 2 tables outside with pizza patron so we took it to go which I felt was a mistake as I wanted one more hot dog as they are a bit small.  The bad  They charge .50c to use debit or CC I hate it when companies do this. The price is a bit high for the amount of food, The staff although friendly seemed to have a hard time with English I always speak Spanish especially when it's a Latin establishment but I oils see this being an issue for my non Spanish speaking buddies. Parking lot is a mess and homeless stroll outside like the walking dead.  Still a great place to try and they have a few locations all in west phx on Indian school."}
{"text":"Great Sonoran hotdogs! My order never gets messed up! I have been coming here for a long time!"}
{"text":"The Sonoran hot dog is a little piece of heaven! Went to visit family and I was told about this place I was only there for two days and I ate here 3 times  and sometimes when I'm craving bacon wrapped hot dogs I'm tempted to drive from CA to AZ just to come here! And everyone who works here is very friendly, and it's very clean!"}
{"text":"I've been craving street tacos for a long time now since my usual taco truck has now relocated and my friend suggested this place. I came in with high hopes. They sell fries, hot dogs, tacos, and even corn in the cup (elotes)   The tacos come in an order of 4 for $6.50. A little pricer than my usual spot. Their tacos also came with a jalapeño and some onions on the side. The tacos itself were not bad but I thought it lacked some flavor. I even used some guacamole sauce and hot sauce but it did no justice. Not what I was hoping for with the tacos but not bad either.   May be back to try the hot dogs"}
{"text":"Quick, hot and good fresh hot dogs. I had the Sonoran and the plain with just mayo, mustard and ketchup. I thought they were delicious and the bun itself was yum. Specialty  dogs not cheap though $3.50 each. Other things on menu will try next time."}
{"text":"Had the Sonoran Dog. Came here just for it. Bottom line is the bun was delicious and toppings all fresh and good. The dog itself was ok. A Nathan or Sabretti in that bun with the fresh toppings would have been great. Located in the SE corner of 83rd and Indian School behind the pizza place."}
{"text":"This one is the food truck location, I still have yet to try the other location on 83rd ave. The food was Very good, my boyfriend and I enjoyed it very much. We plan to go again real soon."}
{"text":"Did not know about this place so I recieved a restaurant.com coupon and I decided to go try it, \"this is why they promote there so people can try it\" got there and lady did not want to recieve my coupon becasue she says that it needs to be in a printed format, when restaurants.com states that either printed or mobile use is acceptable, she was rude and did not even try to make things better, terrible customer service so I decided it was not worth it after all, once you have poor service who knows what they will do to your food back there."}
{"text":"Food was fast, fresh, and delicious! We had the Estila Chihuahua x3 ($3.50 ea.) each, but just after two, I was already feeling full. I also ordered the small coctel de elote ($2.44 w/tax) We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Go ahead. You go there.  So mediocre. And that's being nice.   I did go there and you can take my word for it: his place is as ordinary and unsatisfying as any dump suffixed: \"...berto's\", as in Rollaberto's, Filiberto's...etc.  I ordered the \"Asada Fries\".  Anybody got a waaaaaaay too salty beef chunks, mixed with 7-11-style nacho cheese sauce (-and that's NOT a recommendation) for $5. Really?  Oh yeah, really.  HORRRRRRIBLE.   I should add it was a big portion...but who cares?  As It was horrible quality, why would you want more of it?  Bad. Stay away."}
{"text":"Really good hot dogs, not like the original Mexican hot dogs but very tasty. Great customer service and price."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place tonight. Literally walking distance from our home. Very friendly staff. Menu is simple/easy to read.  We tried the Sinaloa, Sonora, Papas, and Elote. For starters, the papas were delicious!! They had butter, cheese, carne asada and some other stuff on them. Yummy! Unfortunately, every thing else was a bit weird. The corn was hard.. Too crunchy for my liking. My husband refused to eat it because they apparently smelled terrible. (I thought the smell was fine).  There was entirely too much mayo & cheese sauce on the Sinaloa.. So much that it was ALL you could taste. However, the chips on top added great texture.  The Sonora was tasty. Definitely an acquired taste / too many tomatoes on top but still enjoyable. Great prices, not too expensive & we'll definitely be back for those papas! Go try it out. :)"}
{"text":"Had the Carne Asada Tacos . Delicious. I will be back to try the hot dogs.  Everything is immaculate and clean."}
{"text":"Have not had a chance to eat there yet want to take my mother, but you can't view the pictures you have here, they're very very blurry."}
{"text":"We passed this truck, hungry, late at night on the way home from a concert. I've never had a Sonoran dog before so we pulled in. So glad we did. I will now be a regular here. These things kicked ass! Buns were a little toasted on the outside and soft and steamy inside. The bacon wrapped hot dog was smothered in,  well, I don't even know what,  but I instantly wished I'd had ordered 2. My husband  had a slightly different dog, the Chihuahua, with some sort of jalapeño sauce and we shared some Shinola fries topped with jalapeño sauce, guacamole,  sour cream, cotja cheese, chipotle dressing and chipotle sauce and of course, two iced-cold,  glass bottled Mexican sodas. We'll be back. Often."}
{"text":"My husband took me here for lunch while we were visiting his family. I ordered the Sonoran hot dog and it was amazing! Bacon wrapped hot dog with beans, tomato, onion, jalapeño sauce and mayo. I know I'll be craving it until I come back for Christmas"}
{"text":"This is salty junk food heaven. I'm still not a big fan of hot dogs in general, but anyone should try dogs like the Sonoran, with the guacamole and crushed potato chips (queso flavored!) There are also small orders of fries, ranging from carne asada to one that I swear was smothered in like 3 different kinds of peppered mayonnaise (jalapeno, chipotle, etc.)   This is overkill.   This is too much, even for me.   It's only like $3-4 per item.    You might as well go, if you've got the calories to spare."}
{"text":"Not sure if the bun or some vegetables were stale, but the hotdog had a bad taste to it. Dry bun and sausage. If you every had guero canelo from Tucson don't waste your time coming here. It won't be the same. Even the hotdogs from the Phoenix guero canelo are better tasting and cheaper than these. Friendly staff. Overall, very subpar. Will not be returning here again."}
{"text":"So there we were - famished by the long desert journey and parched by the blazing Arizona sun - having just trekked from Northern California for my buddy's wedding in Phoenix (why there? Don't ask me). When I told him about these legendary hot dogs found principally in the wilderness of Arizona, he had to try them. And we did - oh, how we did - much to all of our delight, even the Limey. The cherry on top: a Mexican Coke to wash out the gullet. The best dog in my opinion was the Chihuahuan hot dog and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Very nice food. Sonoran Dogs Plug with a side of Carne Asada fries! Seating can be a problem when it is Rush hour but come around their Food trucks as well for a more open area!"}
{"text":"We usually visit the food truck that parks at 107th and Indian School each night.  The hot dogs are amazing.  Our favorite is the Sonora!"}
{"text":"So the address on here shows 83rd and Glendale, but the actual location in on 83rd and Indian School.  They also do a mobile stand, so maybe the address on here is the owner's home address, because it looks like a residential address. This place is great.  My boss is from Tucson and kept telling me I have to try Sonoran dogs.  I work in the southwest valley and many people at my accounts tell me about their family members that sell delicious Sonoran dogs from their mobile carts at night.  Well I work during the day, so those wouldn't work for me until one of my accounts told me one of the about the best Sonoran dog cart that also has a store on 83rd and Indian School.   I paid them a visit and discovered the most delicious hot dog ever.  A Sonoran dog is a hot dog wrapped in bacon, fried and placed in a bollilo roll and then covered in goodness.  There's ketchup, mustard, beans, tomatoes, onions, and probably more delicious goodness I can't remember.  It sounds overwhelming, but they are sooooo tasty.  $3 for one or they were having a special $5 for two.  I just got one and a bottle of coke and I was full.   They restaurant is small and not fancy.  You order at the counter and there are a few tables inside and a few tables outside to eat at.  The woman who took my order was friendly and bilingual.  They take cash and cards.  If you are looking for authentic Sonoran dogs, this would be the place."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Sonoran hotdogs I've tired. The Arizona is good however I prefer just the original Sonora. The prices are perfect for the serving size."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place. Must try the carne asada fries with the Arizona dog. This is certainly a great meal. If you're a veteran Don't forgot to show your Military ID for 50%off. This is a great way to show your support. Thanks la passadita for another amazing meal, fast service and killer prices. Your number one in my book.  I wrote this Review to boost business because your staff and food is incredible. Best place in the valley keep it up. A loyal customer who will always come back for seconds. Also the Sonora dog is really good. Please stop by and have a try, you won't regret this. My co-workers love you guys too."}
{"text":"I always have to stop here if I'm in the area. can't get enough of the food here. Only complaint is that they charge you more if you use a card, and if you go to their truck at 107th and indian school, they won't accept card at all. It's 2015, everyone uses cards these days, come on!"}
{"text":"\"Hot dogs and Red Vines and potato chips and french fries are my favorite foods.\" ? Betty White  If hot dogs are good enough for Betty, they're good enough for me.  She's the classiest!  Review is for the Sonoran dog, the only thing I ate.  I'm a sucker for a good Sonoran.  What's not to love?  At La Pasadita's, they do things a little different.  The Sonoran features house-made bread, bacon [of course bacon!], beans, grilled onions, jalapeños, tomatoes, mayo, ketchup, mustard, and guacamole.  I can't say I've ever had a Sonoran with ketchup and I don't think their dog really needs it but it was still all very tasty.  It's a bit on the small side and I think I should have ordered two to be happy.  Not the best Sonoran in the valley but definitely delicious!  I would like to try their other dogs like the Chihuahua or the Sinaloa.  All the more reason to be back.  I wish I saw the pictures beforehand too.  Seems like there's a dog topped with Ruffles and cheese.    It's a small cozy place and the staff is friendly even to the awkward looking Asian girls.  ;)  There's a fee to use the credit card machine so cash is definitely preferred and recommended.  Parking can be sketch.  Look for Pizza Patron or you'll miss this place.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Q:  What does a redneck consider a seven-course meal? A:  A hot dog and a six pack of beer!  Nothing screams, \"great eats\" like a semi-permanent food truck parked outside a tire shop. Welcome to Arizona! They have a storefront on 83rd Avenue and Indian School Road but this food truck is legit. They set up shop at 6:00 PM and are there until midnight on most night and are open until 2:00 AM on Friday and Saturday. Dogs are about $3 each.  The Sinaloa, Arizona, and Sonora dogs are among my favorites. The Sinaloa has Ruffles on top. I mean c'mon! The Arizona is super cheesy which is also great. As for the Sonora, it's an Arizona staple so you gotta get it. Wash it down with an ice cold apple soda and it's a tasty meal. So if you need a quick bite to-go or in the mood for some grilled bacon-wrapped wieners nestled in a warm toasty bun, stop on by. Grab three and have yourself a wiener party! You'll get a kick right in the mouthpants and have a mouthgasm!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone who craves some authentic mexican food.  It's worth the drive and very clean.  Get the sonoran dog it will change your life. The ladies here are great."}
{"text":"Not a lover of hot dogs unless it is a NY Sabaret I was beyond bewildered as to why I stopped here. More out of curiosity to try an AZ themed hot dog that my Foodie friends keep raving about.   It was the Friday before Vaca and I wanted to get my junk food on in a place you would never see a Cardiologist. Ha! This place is right on the way home from school so I stopped in.  Amazingly enough I actually loved the Az Hotdog. It was really good, if not good for you.   I also got an order of Carne Asada fries which I could take or leave it. These are the Nachos of the fries world. I am just not a Nacho Lover. I could not taste the fries because there was so much stuff on top of them. The fries I did taste were very bland. Maybe more salt and less sauce? Maybe they are suppose to be this way and it was user error. Oh well, either way, the hot dog was pretty darn good though so check it out.  I ate at the 46th ave location. There is more than one location. Heads up since they are a small local they do charge for credit and debit transactions. This is not uncommon for local businesses and I don't mind at all. However, just letting others know they do that."}
