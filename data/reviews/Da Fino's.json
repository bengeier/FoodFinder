{"text":"I went to this place for breakfast one day.   The employees were very helpful when ordering.   I only speak English so ordering doesn't go very smoothly at some restaurants in Montreal.  The staff here was amazingly helpful and pleasant however.   We had breakfast crepes and coffee.  The food was delicious, the coffee wasn't as good as other cafés in the area but the fact that we had light roast may have been a factor.   It was almost stunning how well we were treated, even as non French speakers.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ate here twice on my recent visit and it was the only place I did that with in 8 meals I had. The food is very tasty, the Crepes with Nutella were hot and delicious. The pricing is very good as a panini sandwich, soup and a tea cost me $8 and the Crepes with a tea was $6.50.  I will be looking for this restaurant again next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"I would recommend checking this place out for a legitimate Montreal cafe experience, complete with beer-bellied mustachioed men sipping the tiniest espressos you've ever seen. They make delicious crepes at affordable prices."}
{"text":"just around the corner from my hotel was this little gem of a café.. with a first look at this place you would possibly consider eating elsewhere but that would be a huge mistake. the mushroom pasta salad was to die for, and a brie with tomato sandwich accompanied it. both were absolutely delicious, and the customer service was fantastic! I plan on returning for more meals there while I am here in the city."}
{"text":"Having been here 2 years ago we strived to find the cafe again for our pre-drive home breakfast.  There is a spacious indoor seating area as well as an moderate outdoor fenced in patio area.  

We all got breakfast sandwiches which were inexpensive and enjoyable.  I dont remember what i paid for my egg, cheese and sausage bagel but it was reasonable.   Just as a note the sausage here is not a patty but rather hotdog like so it was cut up into chunks."}
{"text":"I found this place a few years ago after a Snoop Dogg concert and I was never able to stop talking about their damn chicken salad...  Well tonight my partner and I left the comedy festival famished and I made it my mission to find this place!

Well worth it! Light, healthy, & satisfying!"}
{"text":"I actually checked out this cafe two times during my stay in Montreal. We were looking for a breakfast joint that wasn't McDonalds and were left very satisfied.

The staff is extremely friendly and their breakfast special is the right amount of food to start off your day.

Good coffee too!"}
{"text":"I've worked in the area for two years and have been searching for somewhere to get a healthy, filling and delicious lunch. Finally I found one at da finos cafe. 
The quinoa spinach cakes are out of this world. The salads are not over dressed and saturated in mayo like most places. 
They also have lots of dairy free options which I love. 
Seriously, I'm so happy that I found this place. It's amazing."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast on my last morning in Montreal and it was ok.  The service was great.  The man at the counter was so excited for me to be in Canada and wanted to know all about my travels.  He also translated everything on the menu that I couldn't decipher.  I went with the salmon, cheese, and tomato crepe along with fresh orange juice. The crepe was a little bland, which may have been why the busboy asked if I wanted syrup for my crepe.  On a lox crepe? EWWW.  The orange juice was a bit misleading because I don't think it was freshly squeezed.. more like fresh out of the carton. It was worth the money although next time I think I'll just go for the sweet crepe."}
