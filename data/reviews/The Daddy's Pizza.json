{"text":"I was sold when I saw fresh mushrooms rather than canned ones on the pizza. It's a thin crust pizza that is a bit more bready and chewy. I liked it better than the fluffy crusts of other pizza places. Quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"Decent tasting. Not bad for $5 but tonight when I went,  I ordered breadsticks , similar to crazy bread, but they forgot to include sauce and the bread sticks were undercooked and doughy. My pizza had way too much cheese and was barely cut. The pizza looked like it had just been thrown into the box, getting cheese and sauce all over the inside of the pizza box."}
{"text":"2 stars for the food 0 stars for the customer service..my girlfriend & i wanted to order pizza and wings from a non large chain pizza joints (Dominos pizza hut Papa Johns) so we found this place on line & ordered delivery..now we don't live too far from this place & our address is pretty simple...anyway I called them up and the guy on the phone spoke broken English at best...it gets pretty frustrating when you have to keep repeating the order over & over again..i told him my address at least 4 times....so finally everything was said & done we wait....& we're waiting & waiting finally had to call them up to find out where the hell our food was....guy says he should be there shortly he had trouble with finding your address..as I said in the beginning of this review my house is very easy to find..finally the driver shows up.. We get our food and it's pretty good...it was a little cold but that was really no big deal...anyway my girlfriend liked it so we decided we would give them another try... We wanted to have it delivered again and they already had our address...piece of cake..so again we're waiting & waiting & waiting. Ok this is getting ridiculous..they had our address already from the last time..i call them up & its broken English guy again...he starts yelling at me saying his driver couldn't find my address...WHAT?!?!? you guys were just here not too long ago..you said you already knew our address so WTF?!?!? his driver gets on the phone (also speaks very broken English) & HE starts yelling at me because I can't understand him...so finally I got pissed off and told them forget it....i ended up having Dominos...maybe you guys should hire people that can speak better English and not get mad at the customer for not understanding you or you not understanding the customer.."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza for the price $$ highly recommended! !! Also fast service and great tasting pizza"}
{"text":"I come here all the time and it amazing I love the food. He cooks the food the way I ask and hook me up with extra sometimes. BEST pizza  EVER"}
{"text":"Best. Pizza. Ever.  Thank you for coming from SLC and bringing us the Coronary we missed for so long."}
{"text":"So every year I try to get the kids heart shaped food but there weren't any pizza places near me that would make a reasonably priced heart shaped pizza, until I called here. The customer service was great, the pizza was delicious, it was ,although you can't tell from picture, a perfect heart shape and best of all my kids loved it! It was also only $10! I will definitely be back for pizza."}
{"text":"Not bad for a $5 pizza. The garlic fries are soooo yummy though. I love the little pieces of garlicky goodness tossed in with these babies. Dunk in a side of ranch and you'll be straight on your way to heaven. The breadsticks weren't bad either. Definitely get a side of sauce cause.. duh. ( give me alllllll the sauces). The garlic parm wings weren't bad, even though I'm partial to BWW. They were yummy though. If you're looking for a good bite on a budget, this is your spot. Foods freshly made, and you get a good bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a pizza restaurant to deliver to one of my accounts, for a lunch training, found this place online.  They were local and an independent!  I ordered online, early in the morning, to have a scheduled delivery at 11:45am (they open at 11:00am).  Not only did they deliver on time, the pizza's and appetizers were hot!  Nothing was soggy and everything tasted great!  I didn't order a dessert, but the owner thru in a free dessert.  WHO DOES THAT??  I ordered 3 pies (pizza's), 2-26\" and 1-18\", bread sticks, jalapeño poppers and more.  I got more than I paid for!  Oh, I forgot to mention, he saw my order online and went in early to accommodate!  Again, WHO DOES THIS?  If you're looking for a place to get pizza for any event--work, home or school, I would HIGHLY recommend!"}
{"text":"I had the best customer service experience kumar was great he was very informative and kind.   The pizza and wings were phenomenal they were flavorful and delicious. I placed a large order for them to make pizzas for a party and they were very accommodating overall GREAT PIZZA AND SERVICE!!!!"}
{"text":"Big Daddy's pizza, what used to be Damiano's. I didnt try Damiano's pizza to compare it to Big Daddy's. I guess I've been spoiled to the $5 carryout pizza at little caesars. I saw this place and why not give it a try. their $5 pizza is small compared to regular $5 at caesars.  Flavor: ok, kinda reminded me of the frozen pizzas at the grocery store. crust:ok  would I be back? highly unlikely. I can travel a lil down the ways to grab a pizza of a larger size and Ok taste."}
{"text":"If you want to go somewhere cheap and feed the whole family for pizza this place is it! Not a fan of the $5 pizza at Little Caesar's because it taste like cardboard to me. So being new to Vegas this place is right next to my apartment complex and I had to try it. The pizza honestly is decent but their garlic knots are BOMB! That's really what I come here for now to be honest. They give you a sh*tload with marinara sauce for basically $3 and they're tasty. What I don't like about this place is that they are very stingy with their Parmesan cheese. They will sprinkle it on for you because they claim it's a health issue if you do it yourself and if you ask for more they want you to purchase the packets for 10cents each. 10 cents is not a big deal however I have never gone to ANY pizza place in my entire life who charged for Parmesan cheese! I think it's very petty of them but whatever."}
{"text":"Didn't think anything could get worse than Little Caesars. Awful pizza, owner put about 13 cameras in to watch customers AND his employee, and each pizza comes with exactly one parmesan. If you want two packets, they charge you."}
{"text":"New owners took over a few weeks ago, and I am really impressed. The pizzas cost very little and they actually taste quite good.   I will definitely be going back to this pizza place"}
{"text":"i got pizza hut for many years but as the price increased so i tried big daddy's 4 toppings for 10 bucks & not only is it cheaper it taste better & the service is good."}
{"text":"New businesses typically up their standards for grand openings.  If that's the case, Big Daddy won't be around for long.  This was, by far, the worst pizza I've had.  I was really hoping it would be at least as good as Little Caesers, as Big Daddy is more convieniently located.  We ordered a cheese pizza and a pepperoni pizza.    APPEARANCE:  The pizza is quite small, as another reviewer stated. I believe it's equivalent to a Domino's medium pizza.  I also noticed the pizzas were much flatter than most others. It was hard to pull a slice out of the box.  It's common that we have to re-cut pizzas as they're usually cut in a hurry.  My pizza slicer would not cut thru this pizza.  It was like leather - my daughter has braces and was completely incapable of biting thru the crust.  She ate the stuff off the top. The pepperoni pizza had about 2.5 slices of pepperoni per slice - not enough for pepperoni in every bite.  Both pizzas were full of grease.  TASTE:  The sauce was good.  The grease made me think back to high school pizza (I graduated in '95).  I made a comment about high school pizza, and everyone else said \"no, school pizza is better.\"  There was an adequate amount of cheese.  OVERALL:  Save your $5 and get pizza ANYWHERE else, seriously.  Go to Albertsons and get a frozen one to cook yourself.  Drive up Nellis and go to Little Caesers.  As convenient as this place might be,  it's just not even worth $5."}
{"text":"I saw a yelp review on the garlic sticks...so I had to try them! Stopped in about 10:30 on a Saturday night. He made them fresh. They were REALLY good. And I don't usually like red sauce, but this one had a bite to it, not sweet at all. Not sure if this is a different sauce than what they put on regular pizzas. Got hubby a Hawaiian but he didn't eat it yet. Will definitely go back for pizza cravings.... and they do deliver! Will be trying other stuff on the menu.  Ps....I do NOT like little ceasers pizza, seems to be a common theme here in the reviews. And there is no seating to actually eat at the restaurant."}
{"text":"This pizza reminded me what you would buy when you were in college from the dorm cafe, or if I was supporting the senior trip fundraiser. The wings were terrible, looked nothing like the pictures (just plain lazy that they didn't use their own food in their flyer). The Garlic Bubba Bread was just a bread stick, pretty bland, but at least that was free with the coupon from the flyer (still not worth it).  I understand that mistakes happen, and the delivery driver either left the soda in his car, or at the store so I called back and said he forgot it. I ordered, and they advertise, Pepsi. When the driver came back, he handed me RC Cola (good, my drains needed cleaning anyway).  All this for $34.ish plus a $5 tip. If it cost me half, it still would have been too much."}
{"text":"So irritated!!!!! This is the worst pizza I have ever had!!!! We decided to order the 28\" cheese pizza. When I got it, it was completely burnt, there was barely any cheese. Now, I'm stuck with this huge butt pizza that no one will eat!! I will never go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Waste of money. The chicken wings were nasty breaded and dough like. I would not recommend this place . Wish I would have paid with my card so I could of disputed the charge. $40 later and I'm still hungry ."}
{"text":"Food is alright. Didn't serve any sauce with jalapeños poppers. Asked for a side of pesto, and they said they don't have any. But they sell a pesto pizza. Also didn't give us napkins. Service was mediocre. Didn't really seem to care. Guy used his cell phone then touched the pizza with no gloves."}
{"text":"All I have to say: THEIR CALZONES  Also, the garlic knots are amazing.  I mean, sure, everything else is amazing too....."}
{"text":"This is possibly the worst pizza I've ever had in my life.  This place just opened up and we got a flyer in the mail and the advertisement looked delicious so we decided to give it a try.  You know when a new joint opens up and they do their best to please and the give extra stuff.  Normally this is how the pizza places are in Vegas.  Super delicious when they open and they gradually get worse and cut back over the years.    Well Big Daddy Pizza is not going to make it that long I promise you.  I hate to bash a new business but as you can see from the photos I posted of the chicken and pizza.........the quality is horrible.  It reminded me of cafeteria pizza.  There was actually a review of a guy talking  about fresh mushrooms.    I would like to go Maury Povich on this review and say that was a lie.  I know fresh food when I see it and I'm sure other people do to.  The pizza was super thin as you can see from the picture.  The wings didn't have any meat on them at all.  I went back and looked at the photos posted by the business and the food looked delicious but what arrived at my door step tonight was trying to disguise itself as pizza and wings and didn't pull it off at all.  Well their advertisement worked and I ordered from them but I'm tempted to mail it back and advise them to try again.  The End"}
{"text":"Okay so this was a spur of the moment stop. We needed something cheap and saw the $5 large pick up special. I hate little Caesars so I figured I've give them a shot. We walked in and it's a tiny place but they were pretty busy for being 3 in the afternoon. We ordered, the guy who took my order was really friendly, you could tell he was slammed with orders. We waited about 15 mins and walked out with what smelled like a great pizza. Got home opened the box and took a slice. Shockingly it was good..... like REALLY good! Great crust, awesome sauce, golden chewy cheese.. what more could I ask for.. AND it's only 5 bucks... I've lived across the street for almost 6 months! Why I waited so long?? But needless to say we will be back. Definitely need to try the wings!"}
{"text":"I drive down Nellis quite often and for the last couple of weeks I have seen people holding signs for a new pizza place offering $5.00 take out pizza's. Today on the way home I didn't have time to fix lunch other than a sandwich so I thought I would try this place as Joey's is growing somewhat old. They only have two pizza's for $5.00 and that is the cheese or pepperoni. I opted for the sausage which still wasn't bad $7.20 out the door.   The pizza was made in about five minutes, and was quite good for just a quick pizza, better than many around that I have had that I have paid much more for. The menu may be limited, but from the pizza I tried I will have to try more when I have the time."}
{"text":"The pizza is good, not great.  I'd say average within it's class, which means better than half the value pizza places they compete with.  However, the take-out special is by far the best deal around.  14\" cheese or pepperoni for $5.00, and they even include packets of grated parm and red peper.  So, if your priority is value, this is the place.  (If you'd rather pay a little more for better flavor, try Roma's on Tropicana.)"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and wings with great customer service. Happy customer :) For sure, I will recommend to my friends and family. ."}
{"text":"Great!!   I like this place. Great customer service.  Very good food. Try everything on the menu. But the pizza. And the wings are great.  Very price convince. Pls people don't be afraid to spend $2 more for a good pizza. And stop going to that $5 pizza nasty place. Come here to big daddy's better.  God bless this place and everyone that buys from this great restaurant."}
{"text":"Even in the world of \"cheap-ass-pizza\" I've had better.  Big Daddy's is a teeny, hole in the wall place with a walk-up window and a park bench. From this window you can order ready-to-go pizzas, bread sticks, ribs, and other \"delicacies\" for $5. They have done some serious advertising from sign-twirlers, mailings, and they even took out a huge billboard across the road from where it is located.  The pizza is cardboard-style with chunky-like cheese. The only pretty decent thing going for it, is the sauce - very robust and flavorful. Too bad it's being put on such a cheap meal.  Overall - it's aaallll right. Obviously you are paying $5 for a pizza, so what to expect? But. I'd rather go to Little Ceaser's and get their ready-to-eat pizza AND their CRAZY BREAD."}
{"text":"Disgusting food and worse service. Food was soggy, gross and wrong. Restaurant refused to make it right"}
{"text":"I actually like this pizza. I've gone to this place multiple times. However, the customer service is lacking.  My mom placed an order for two pizzas,  a cheese and a sausage, and bread . The cheese is $5 everyday.  According to their in store menu the sausage is $6.66 and the bread is $3.99. They charged me $20. I told the guy that it shouldn't be that price, and he claimed that my mom ordered a 14 inch sausage pizza instead of the large. Fine. However. The pizzas were the same size when I got home. My mom called and complained and the guy we talked to said he had no idea who took our order but no one is going to sell a sausage pizza for $6. We paid $10 for a sausage pizza that was the same size as the cheese. The guy on the phone made us feel like we were trying to scam him and was extremely rude. I hope they enjoyed their $7 tip."}
{"text":"Fantastic local place. The seasonings are delicious, the crust is perfect - not cracker thin and not overly thick.  They have quite a selection on their menu - more than is listed on their take out menus. Try the rib tips if you can get them - they always run out of them so order early! The bread sticks are better than the ones at big chain pizzerias.   It's a walk-in and pick up place only, no seating. They have Cactus Cooler, this makes up for it!"}
{"text":"This is a window where you can pick up food, literally.  There is no seating, unless you count the garden bench somebody got from Big Lots.  So the place is what the kids used to call \"Ghetto\" but the food is decent.  You are not paying a lot.  The pizza sauce was good.  I know some people won't like it because it is not overly sweet like they are in a lot of the chain pizza joints.  If you like a more savory pizza sauce, you will like this.  I got the ribs and they were good.  They are not something to rave about but they were good.  What do you want for paying so little money?"}
{"text":"I love this place. I don't like a ton of dough. I like to actually taste my toppings and this is perfect. Great deal"}
{"text":"I have ordered from Big  Daddys at least 3 -4 times a month since they first opened.  There's a new owner it's a five dollar pizza not a 5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"I order a 14 Inch cheese, a 18 inch vegetable with sausage pepperoni with uber eats. Was very good on time. But I didn't realize the crust was a bit thin. Also my pizza had a spicy kick to it but wasn't over welming. It cost 32.00+delivery came to 40. I gave driver 3.00 bucks. All in all it was good....I will order again but something else to try next time."}
{"text":"This is not a sit down place! No beer ... This is like a quick pizza place.. pic up and drive away.. Good price! Friendly staff."}
{"text":"If anyone is looking for a low price but great quality pizza? This is the place to go.  If you don't want to wait long and are last minute, they are also fast!! (12-15 minutes). Their bread sticks are also great!! Highly recommended. Must try it's awesome."}
