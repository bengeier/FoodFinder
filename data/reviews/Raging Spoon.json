{"text":"Ridiculously delicious vegan sausage--worth ordering just on its own. I don't have a clue what it's made of (possibly the souls of baby calfs or something) but you could put a feedbag full of it over my face and I'd eat it for an hour.  My favourite is the wilted, buttery spinach on a bagel with a fried egg (mouth watering as I write this) but I also love the generously portioned lox and cream cheese on a bagel.  Light and airy atmosphere, good tunes, laid back vibe and quick service. I love sitting at the big, communal table with a group of friends reviewing the weekend's gossip and picking from everyone's plates."}
{"text":"I only came here to sit down with a friend for some coffee and juice, but I still enjoyed my experience. There's not a lot of pizazz to this place, but the service was great and there's a lot of seating room off of the main area with various vintage dinette sets and leather couches.   The initiative behind this cafe is to offer employment opportunities for people who have been through the mental health system, which is a worthy establishment to support, in my books.   The Raging Spoon also offers catering services and a gift shop. They shut down in the afternoon, so this place is best for lunch."}
{"text":"LOVE IT HERE! Friendly Staff and great service. I've only been here for Brunch though.  Oh the food! Something for everyone: Vegans, Vegetarians and those who eat meat.  If you are a meat eater, seriously try the Vegan Sausage. You will be pleasantly surprised. So tasty.  Try the Soy Lattes, Corn Bread. Find them on Facebook you can read all about the lunches they serve.  I'm making me hungry.  Come here, it's good."}
