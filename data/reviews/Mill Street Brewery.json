{"text":"Not impressed with the bar staff, just looking for a pint while waiting for my flight to depart. Sat at the bar for 10 minutes without a staff member to take an order. This was my first visit and my last."}
{"text":"Cool place to go to between flights.
I'm starting to feel like an airport food connoisseur. 
This place is more like a bar though. What I really liked about it is that after 10 minutes,  I forgot I was in an airport. I took the Mac n cheese with the kale salad. Kale is my new obsession, in this case it brought this element of freshness that would have made the Mac N Cheese too heavy. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Great service always, no matter what time. Bar is great an I love Mill St Beers so I have some bias. The menu is simple, food is okay... could use an update. But it is cheap, fast and not a chain store, which is what is needed in an airport.  Bar staff is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"What can I say , these guys do it right . After sandy last year and the stress of trying to get home we landed in Toronto with 3 hungry tired children . The staff where the best they entertained the kids so my wife and I could eat . The food came quick for the children so there was no waiting and whining. The food was cooked perfect and tasted great . The beer was ice cold and refreshing and we all know how us Canucks love our beer. It's my go to restaurant when in Pearson . Matter fact if all goes well I'll be drinking and eating there on January first"}
{"text":"So if you think airport restaurant means bottled beer and average food prepare to be impressed. 8 or 9 great Mill St. brews on tap - I'll be honest that's what drew me in. Sat at the bar and about half way through my first pint (100th Meridian) decided I should have some food. I was surrounded by folks ordering amazing looking burgers but I really just wanted something light so I flipped to the salad section of the menu.
I ordered the Falafel Salad. Excellent!!
Fresh ingredients - it was delicious."}
{"text":"Beer was the highlight. Had an IPA that was excellent. 

Service was friendly but a little slow. Took almost 15 mins for my beer to show up. 

As for the food..... Well let's just say it left to be desired. The smoked meat was cold even though you could tell it had been reheated. The fries were cold as well. The coleslaw was bland. 

Will I go back? Not likely."}
{"text":"I came here at a fairly busy time during the evening while I had 1 hour to kill waiting for my flight, and I was not particularly impressed with the food or service. 

While the bus ladies and men were nice, my particular server was quite grumpy and slow, and it took her a long time to bring me a simple glass of water and take my order. The working environment must be small or the service management must be chaotic because I also noticed that 4-5 glasses shattered and broke in the ~40 mins I was there because servers kept bumping into each other.

As for the food, my turkey wrap with salad was far too salty and cold. I could not taste the elements of the wrap due to the overwhelming saltiness. The wrap also felt like it was warmed up in the microwave after being frozen, since parts of my wrap were cold (not lukewarm) while other portions were warm. Furthermore, I was also disappointed that the serving size was so small for the price, though I certainly wasn't surprised since airport restaurants always hike up the prices.

The one thing I actually liked about this place was the buzzing, lively atmosphere. Other than that, I would not return."}
{"text":"Awesome place.  The beer is the best (Vanilla Porter rocks) and the Montreal Special will fill you up before your flight.  Great staff too."}
{"text":"Negative star if possible. Staff won't even look at you. Rude when they to finally talk to you. Dirty tables. Manger yelling at everyone the whole time at staff and throughout restaurant. Food is at least edible. Would be embarrassed to be running this restaurant. 
Stay away !"}
{"text":"Great service! Had a pint and plate of wings. Found a pretty rare wing about halfway through and could not eat any more. Dis not mention the issue, but one of the staff said that had checked my plate, noticed the raw wing, and that my bill was fully comped. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Expensive breakfast given orange juice was obviously from frozen concentrate (at $4 a pop!), potatoes were from frozen too and fruit side that came with big breakfast dish was one strawberry and one blackberry.   I would recommend walking about 75 meters further in the terminal  to A&W where you can get a classic breakfast for half the price."}
{"text":"I think 1 star is accurate.  I was going to say 0 stars because of the stomach ache and nausea I had from eating there but maybe it was an especially off night for them.  Although I don't think the toxic energy and general bad attitude of the staff was a one-off.  It makes for a poor dining experience when the staff is fighting w each other and the bartender lady is swearing and throwing things.  

At least the food was poor to mediocre.  The bright side is that I only had a stomach ache and didn't actually throw up."}
{"text":"I love this place. I travel across the globe and I look forward to this airport meal the most. Can't say anything wrong. Wonderful service, food and craft beer. My usual is the Cobb salad with steak. Tell me why other airport spits can't do this? Way to go Mill St."}
{"text":"Sandwiches are as lacklustre as their management. They screwed up my drink order and when I complained, the manager came over and told me not to \"lose it\". Next time, I'm sticking with Tim's!"}
{"text":"Eat here often. There is an above average airport veggie burger and some decent snacks to go with it.  They have their own homemade root beer which I quite enjoyed. Probably one of the better airport restaurants. Customer service is slow, especially if you come at a busy time. I've waited at least 15 minutes after asking for the bill."}
{"text":"Sllllllooooooooooowwww service! Ridiculous. Not that busy, seemed that each waitress just had 2 or 3 tables each. They just mosey around at their own pace. Chit chatting and texting. Sat down at a bar seat at 9:05PM. Finally got a menu at 9:16. 9:30 comes around no sign of my waitress. Flagged down a manager to take my order. This is an airport. People have flights to catch! She came by at 9:35 to get my order. Really? 30 minutes until you can ask me what I want after being seated? She seemed frazzled that I gave the manager the order. Observed many other people impatiently trying to get staff attention for bills etc.

Got my food fairly fast, funny thing was I got another meal brought to me 10 minutes later! Haha! I guess she punched it in again. Complete clusterfuck. 


The beer was excellent, tank house ale is great. Food was mediocre pub fare. Would have been great if it did not take 90 minutes to eat a burger and have a beer. Lucky I was early for my flight. 

Bottom line, if you have time to kill this place is fine. But the wait staff blows!"}
{"text":"I can't say that The Big Brewery 3 egg breakfast with Bacon, sausage,hash browns and toast was worth $16.50 but the sausage was of good quality and what gets this restaurant the four stars is the service and ambiance.  Almost everywhere else on the d20's row post-security in terminal1, you get scrambled eggs that were likely  microwaved  many hours ago and assembled by a multi-tasking food counter attendant from a steaming container underneath a heat lamp...

Here, At 6am, you will see yourself being greeted by quilt skirt wearing, perky, cougar-aged waitresses that are super friendly and enthusiastic who seemed to genuinely enjoy their work and for a Change - appeared to actually and truly want  to be there, serving hungry passengers quickly with a big smile, at a very early morning hour.  

The restaurant was packed with morning airport commuters.  Decor wise, it has a genuine British pub ambiance with lots of mahogany wooden furniture, ample booths and high chair table seating and an impressively endless list of domestic and import brews. 

The 3 egg big breakfast looked great but it's nothing special so the $20 spent was well
Worth it for average food with great ambiance and exceptional service; keep It going!"}
{"text":"Apparently this is the best food in Toronto airport. But I would say it's pretty mediocre.  The menu is pretty thin.  I had a burger requested rare and of course it was not.  at which point she then tells me that they only do it well done.  After I had opened by asking her if I should go for the burger or the baked macaroni and cheese with sausage. Question ever mention the well-done at that point"}
{"text":"In my opinion, the best of the limited options at Pearson airport. Good beer selection, if overpriced. They had 4 ales, 2 lagers, one stout and 2 seasonal brews on tap. For some reason the seasonals were double the price ($9 for only 10 oz) so I stuck with Tankhouse ale, which is a fine beer. 
I was nervous about the food after reading the other reviews, but my Angus burger was very tasty. Served with typical pub fries. 
I'm giving them a pass on the pricing due to the airport location, but they lose one star for slow and unfriendly service."}
{"text":"i ate here for breakfast as i was catching a flight to Northern Ontario at pearson from Vancouver. I was surprised that this place was open. I ordered the strawberry and cream waffles with a side of hash browns and juice and coffee. The food was absolutely fantastic. The waffles and strawberry and whipped cream and syrup were extremely flavorful and tasty. The hash browns were tremendous nice and crunchy with red peppers to provide a bit of freshness. However the customer service was poor. I waited ten minutes to be served in the restaurant and it wasnt busy at 6 am and then waited another ten minutes to get my bill. I understand no one likes to work at 6 am on a Saturday but service has to be better. Food is tremendous though"}
{"text":"Quick service and fresh ingredients.  It's a nice place to relax and sit when you have a layover in Pearson airport.  It's. Ice to watch the hockey game and listen to good music. The staff is friendly."}
{"text":"So stuck in Toronto airport but found 
Mill st brew pub.  Great food great beer and loved the people - especially Tricia who made me smile on s rather bad night"}
{"text":"Food is solid. Service was exceptional and quick. They pack a lot of folks into this small space. Get you in, give you good food, and you can be on your way. The burger was top notch. Price wasn't that bad considering its at the airport. Solid recommendation given your options here."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast while waiting for a flight on a July Monday morning, around 10am.  There were only a couple of tables occupied out of maybe a dozen or fifteen?  (plus a few seats available at the bar).  Took a minute to be seated, but not long.  Noticed a few tables had reserved signs on them.  Basic bar atmosphere.

Very friendly waitress, chatted with us about a bit of this & that with a good sense of humour.

My Scrambled Breakfast Burrito $13 (peppers / onions / cheese / tomato) was good and a large portion, but I found quite salty at the bottom, almost as if it had been sitting in salt, since the majority of the dish wasn't bad at all.  Sour cream & guacamole on top.  Very good home fries, slightly seasoned.  My partner enjoyed his eggs benny very much.

I would go back here again but try something else."}
{"text":"If you happen to be flying out of Pearson and some how hit the jackpot in terms of departure terminals (T1) you'll be of the lucky few who get to enjoy their amazing dining options which include the Mill Street Brew Pub. 

I was in a hurry to catch a flight to Ottawa so I couldn't dine in and take in the full ambiance of this place, however, the Mill Street to go counter outside of the restaurant is a great option for taking food on the plane.

The menu is simple but delicious with plenty of options that are easy to carry with you as you run through the airport. I had a Grilled Thai Chicken wrap which had been cooked in some sort of beer from Mill St (tankhouse I believe) and was grilled on the outside once completed. Not the meal I \"wanted to eat\" with so many better options available for sit down, but definitely a good one!

In T1, forget about the other beer lounge options, this is the place to eat!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Menu was limited. Food was worse. They are taking the trapped at a airport thing too far. Wait staff was good though if you want a silver lining."}
{"text":"After a long flight, it was such a treat to relax and stop in for a sit down bite prior to our next flight. One of the air Canada reps recommended this restaurant and were we ever satisfied. We ordered the Mexican poutine and the Frickles and both were absolutely AMAZING! Super surprising for airport food. The variety was incredible and I'm sure everything would taste amazing. The presentation of the food was also surprisingly great for how quick our food came out.
The bar was clean, sleek and the waitresses were overly kind and helpful. It was nice to see that they actually cared about us. The managers were constantly going around and helping everyone.
I'd definitely recommend this lovely little location. It's situated perfect above the escalators when you come in and in the safe area so you don't need to get checked again."}
{"text":"Slow service.Picked this restaurant because it was busy and ordered burger and fries .Burger was OK but lettuce was brown and wilted and tomato was absolutely tasteless . Fries were overcooked , limp soggy and cold .
Enough very expensive calories"}
{"text":"The decor is contemporary, clean and inviting.  The presence of power sockets plus dedicated outlets for USB is well thought through.

Our dining experience whilst waiting for a connecting flight  sadly did not compliment the looks of the restaurant;

Whilst getting a table was handled well, f&b service was slow and passive in nature.  The food order was not handled properly in my wife's case.  My own order - chicken pot pie - had a Luke warm gravy poured over hot mashed potatoes and pie.  Well presented, but ultimately disappointing. My wife also said her food was similarly not hot - chicken wings - a bad sign given the nature of the dish.

Rather than make a fuss when I paid the bill plus gratuity I advised the waitress of the situation and received a very blasé response."}
{"text":"Standard airport bar type food. Looks like the breakfast menu is best but after 10:30am you can only get the big breakfast which includes plastic-like eggs. Recommend looking around as there are plenty of cool spots nearby work free iPad use."}
{"text":"This is my second time eating here and the food is good and reasonably priced, places to plug in and recharge is a bonus. Always a big crowd, that tells you something, I will keep coming back, just be patient with the service"}
{"text":"Great service. Our server was very nice. All the women wear skirts lol. I go here often when I'm connecting through the Pearson! Mac and cheese was tasty, sundries tomatoes were interesting in it. Caesar salad was very unique and tasty! - a little on the flavourful side though as I got half way through it. Tasty beer too!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here with my husband and 2 people from his work while we were waiting for a connecting flight.

Like most airport restaurants the menu was limited and over-priced. The food was ok.

I had a kale and spinach salad $16. I was going to add some chicken to it but it was like an extra $7-8. And I'm sure the quantity would not have been like half a chicken. So I went vegetarian for the meal, haha. The salad was satisfactory. It didn't have any iceberg lettuce, thank goodness. It was filled with real greens (kale and spinach). It also had watermelon radishes, grapefruit, mango and goat cheese - not nearly enough of the latter three ingredients, mind you, but they were present. The dressing, which I asked for on the side, was thick and sweet. It went well with the slightly bitter salad. The salad itself was good, but for $16 I expect at least a bit of protein.

My husband had the beef dip with fries $18. The meat was deli meat, enough said. 

Eh, I guess for airport restaurant dining that's the way it is."}
{"text":"Yes its a Pub, but they do have a nice breakfast menu. They don't have A'la Carte menu , but they have a traditional Canadian breakfast, and omelettes, and more. I had the fruit with yogurt, it was delicious, a bit sweet. Sweetened yogurt, fruit, honey, sugar rush.  Coffee was ok. Service was great. Prices are high as expected."}
{"text":"Stopped in while waiting for a flight. Had the basic burger and a tank house ale. The burger was served in about three minutes so obviously precooked. Fries that came with it were extremely undercooked and not too warm. Portions were not up there with the prices. Beer was good and served nice and cold the way I like it.
Service was fast and friendly. 
Although a better option than Bar 120 across the aisle. (their club sandwich is a ripoff) there are better choices in terminal one for food. Will stop in for a pint again though."}
{"text":"A little disappointed. I was in the mood for some wings, but not being able to have gluten I asked beforehand If they were breaded, I was reassured they were not, so bring on the wings. Now the waitress didn't look particularly interested in being there, but man did the food come out quick, I think the fastest I've ever been served.  Upon enjoying the wings, something wasn't right, because they were completely covered in sauce, I did not notice they WERE breaded. It took forever for the waitress come back to the table, when she did I mentioned it and she was extremely apologetic, I think it was more because she was scared of a lawsuit or something, not because she had concerns for me. Anyways I got the burger instead and it was ok, not worth the $14 that's
For sure, but this is in an airport so they gouge you as much as they can.

In closing I wouldn't go back, mostly due to the staff looking like they would rather be somewhere else."}
{"text":"Pretty good fare in an airport.  

Didn't really know anything about this place, was just craving a beer and some decent food and stumbled on this place.  They brew their own beer on site so that sold it for us.  

Service was quick and attentive.  Even though the World Series was going on, every TV had hockey on (as expected). 

West coast style IPA (3): Saw this on draft so I tried that.  Since I'm from the west coast, their version was quite underwhelming.  I'd say it was more of a hoppy Hefeweizen than an IPA.  Was medium bodied.  Color was cloudy and had a nice fruit palate to it.  Not hoppy like a west coast IPA though.  I think if they named it differently it would have set the expectations a little better.  

Oktoberfest (4): One of their seasonal offerings.  That one was decent with some really nice malt to it.  I think I'd stick to the malty beers here. 

Fish n Chips (4): came out as one nice large chunk of fish.  Lightly battered and flavorful.  Fries came with gravy which was awesome and poutine-like.  

Spicy Chorizo Pot Pie (5): I thoroughly enjoyed this one.  Not too spicy but just enough kick to keep you interested.  The pastry top was crispy and buttery.  The filling just had an amazing sausage flavor to it.  Even the salad was a nice complement to the dish which had my favorite balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  

After a day of traveling and walking all over the place, this 'airport food' was a nice treat before our next leg of our journey."}
{"text":"Got and Hour to wait before your flight? I can not think of a better way use it then by sampling one of their darn good Brews and having a good meal or snack before your flight. Mills IPA was a stand out of the sampler beers we had. The food was good and the tables are restful with space to put your bags right next to your table. They have Wi/Fi and charging stations all over the place. I left the pub relaxed and ready to fly."}
{"text":"Always great breakfast, wonderful, friendly and efficient servers for those who have early morning flights. 

I've been here a couple times for lunch and the fish & chips with a nice cold pint hits the spot !!"}
{"text":"Ugh, this place will  hold you hostage. The service was so. so. so. so. bad.

I've been here a handful of times, and have always had really slow service, but never bad enough to stay away. However, my last trip there was the straw that broke the camel's back.

I was seated at the rail bar, and somehow managed to get ignored by the bartender for 45 minutes. I ordered food and he forgot to punch it in. By the time he realized he'd messed up, it was too late, I had to run to get my connection. 

So Mill Street, it's time I broke up with you for good!"}
{"text":"When you need a good place to eat/drink/watch the big game during a long layover in Toronto, the Mill St Pub provides a good place to take a break and pass the time. Although it can be pretty busy at times, the staff is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"When dining in an airport, it's important to reduce your expectations. I'll even partially blame myself for showing up for a flight without a full stomach. However, blame aside, it was a Sunday, I was kind of hungry, and I saw football on the tv's so made my way in for a beverage and bite to eat.

The friendly hostess at the door convinced me I wouldn't need to sit at the bar as we'd be able to see the tv's from the dining room area. I agreed and went and sat down within reasonable visual proximity to the tvs. No sound to be heard from the tv's, but whatever... It was football and I had time to kill, so thought it would be fine. I then began to wait. And wait. And wait. Finally we got some menus, and eventually even got to order food and drinks from it.

If you've had Mill Street Beers, you'll know that they are \"pretty okay\". Mill Street Organic, 100th Meridian Amber, or their West Coast IPA are all better than anything made by their corporate owners Labatt's (or it's hierarchical international owner InBev, for that matter). Settling in for some significantly priced-up but moderately decent tasting beers was the sole highlight in this visit.

Food wise, we decided on simply sharing a Chicken Club Sandwich ($17) as half a sandwich and some fries still seemed more filling and substantial than sharing a $17 plate of nachos or $14 spinach dip. It was not a great sandwich, especially with the overly dry chicken and questionably fresh wholewheat bun. The bacon and basil pesto mayo were the saving graces in making this sandwich work, but I probably could have gone to the Tim Hortons down the hallway for half the price and been just as happy. 

And despite all this, I might even have still given this place a 3rd star if the service wasn't such a ball drop. But the time between being seated, given menus, ordering food, trying to get a second drink, asking for the bill, finally paying... It was a struggle to overlook the mediocrity of the food, even with my lowered airport expectations.

I'm not going to say this was the worst brew pub or bar you'll find in an airport (Molson Lounge in Calgary, I'm looking at you!), but I'll be sure to keep it to the drinks next time and might just end up sitting at the bar to avoid the potential service issues."}
{"text":"I understand the pricing, it's an airport after all. The bartender was, I would say, borderline surly. The service was slow and, when it came, the food mediocre and not hot. Too bad, they have a captive audience."}
{"text":"First time here and it will be my last. The hostess looked like she hated her life and our server Stephanie was ridiculously rude , she didn't even introduce herself I only know she's steph cause another server yelled her name. No breakfast options for vegans except frozen pre made tatertots *which were soooòo not yummy*  towards the very end of our visit our server was kinder but by then she had already been so rude it put a damper on things"}
{"text":"Four stars for the beer and two for the food. While I will always love classic Canadian pilsners (Labatt Blue, Molson Canadian, and Moosehead), while eating I want something with more depth in the flavor profile. Mill Street Brewery's Black Watch Scotch ale, ESB, and the Oatmeal stout are all exceptional. 

The food on the other hand wasn't memorable in anyway and that's giving it a discount given this was their airport location. Recommend sticking to the classic pub food if you do decide to pair with your beer."}
{"text":"Wanted so badly to love this place. For an airport restaurant it was ungodly slow... We have eaten at restaurants at this airport quite often and never wait 45 minutes for food. To be fair I think we just had a terrible waitress. She had no personality and didn't come back ever to refill our soft drinks- that and she charged us $3 for soda water and $4 for a lemonade. With prices like that customers may expect refills. 

The food itself was actually pretty good. I had the kale Caesar salad and it had a good flavor and it was a good serving without being too much. We also had the tater tots which were served with a spicy dressing as well as a tzatziki sauce. They came out 10 minutes after the rest of our food. 

Waitress had an excuse for everything and not shockingly she couldn't get the credit card machine to work... Other tables seemed to not have the same issue."}
{"text":"I sure hope you don't have a carry-on suitcase when you come here, because there is no room to put it with how close together the tables are.  There were four tables with two people each, all with suitcases the last time I came here. The waitresses were falling over them and dropping trays. I don't blame the waitresses for this- this is a problem with management trying to maximize the amount of people they can serve. The poutine here isn't that great, burgers are even worse, and the service sucks.  I also blame management for the bad service- waitresses are given too many tables. I've been here twice, and both times were nothing to rave about. Typical crummy airport dining experience."}
{"text":"This place is fun... expect the usual kind of pub food I guess, but let's add fish tacos as an example of something more fresh... and of course, the beer's decent too! One of my standby's every time I'm in YYZ is their Frickles, deep fried pickles - maybe not one of my healthiest choices, but hey I seem to make it every time which must count for something, right?  :)"}
{"text":"Did a quick stop by in \"The 6\" as a connecting flight to my final destination, Rome. The Mill St. Brewery smelled the best as I passed by, and the choice of craft beer on tap was great. The casual yet luxury cabin style aesthetic paired with great 70-80s songs on the radio further convinced me in.

I ordered their pub fish & chips, and I have to say that the taste of the fish really surprised me. The flavor was actually present, and I dare say that it was rather fresh and genuinely caught from the Atlantic. I believe the fish was Haddock, and it paired well with the juicy lemon and lime they had to offer. Compared to Ohio, where the majority of the fish comes off as frozen or from the lakes. The fires are hand cut, but I didn't think anything fascinating about them. They came out warm, and a bit stiff. The portions are not large, but hey, it's airport food. To drink I had a pineapple IPA, which was very good. Even if you're not into IPAs, I do think that the fruity smoothness will be enough to satisfy. Plus it comes in a 20oz glass.

As a last note, the service was very courteous and patient. They do not rush you with the bill or keep passing your table to insinuate that you should be in a rush. You can easily sit here and have just a drink or two, and they won't pester you. The price is obviously higher being in an airport, but at least it isn't box food. While I thought the fish was very good, I would still say, only eat in a airport if you really are starving, because it'll always cost more.

Happy holidays everyone!"}
{"text":"This is the best place to eat in the domestic terminal at Pearson airport. There is a great selection of beer and the service is good. I wish they had more healthy options but it's definitely great bar food."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar while waiting for a flight to Québec City. Found a seat and was served immediately but the bar staff was not very friendly. Also I sat near the waitress station where I could hear conversations between staff about customers, and it wasn't pleasantries being discussed. The beer was great! I ordered the West Coast IPA and it is on par with IPAs in the US. Their staff could really use some improvement in the hospitality aspect though.

Also I had a purse draped on the back of the chair I was sitting in and the staff consistently hit it while walking by even though there was a 3 ft space between it and the wall. They either gave no fucks or have terrible coordination."}
{"text":"Good place to drink beer between flights. You can take your time drinking at the bar with always has a seat free. The beer prices are reasonable for an airport and they have a good selections. The staff was very nice.

They have plugs for your electronics but not all of the USB outlets work.

The biggest let down is the food. First don't take the selection of the bartender. 3 people at the bar did and wished they ordered something else. Second, the food looks beautiful and very enticing but don't be fooled. It's okay at it's best. Just get an okay burger to enjoy with your beer. 

I will likely go back if I have 2 hours to kill at the airport"}
{"text":"Not my first time here. There is very little at this end of the airport as far as eating goes.

As far as this place, the staff is awesomely friendly and efficient for them I give 5 stars.

I saw the sign outside today that said try the Chis and fips the batter was good and the fish a touch dry but all in all a good deal for the location and the price.

That being said, I guess I  spoiled from eating fish and chips at Kahunas in white rock."}
{"text":"The beer is good and wet which is handy when you need to dunk your styrofoam-dry burger to get it down. One of the worst burgers I've tasted.  Remind me to keep one of these burgers on the boat in the event of a leak!

My first experience here guarantees there won't be a second. Worth the walk to ... anywhere else."}
{"text":"Food is actually decent here and would normally give a 4 star for food. But regrettably, the service is terrible here. Unfriendly hostess who appears as though she'd rather be working elsewhere. It then took several attempts to flag down the waitress to get service. I ordered a wheat ale and the unenthusiastic waitress eventually brought me my drink. I noticed it didn't taste right (tasted very hoppy) but she was no where to be found. I only drank maybe 1/5 of the pint and needed to get my bill. On the bill I was charged for an $11 IPA (not a wheat beer. And for non beer drinkers FYI there's a huge difference between the two). I told the waitress and she callously told me \"we ran out of the wheat beer.\"  I was appalled with her non apologetic attitude because 1. If I hadn't noticed the $11 I would have paid for something I didn't order and 2. Why didn't she come back to tell me they ran out instead of slipping me something they think I wouldn't notice?

I made it a point and she took it off my bill which was the right thing to do. Needless to say, no tip (and i won't name drop the waitress)

This type of attitude has occurred more than once at this place. 

I recommend going elsewhere unless you don't mind unfriendly service."}
{"text":"Ate here whilst changing planes. Had the bacon burger which was really good. It's a nice place to eat at Pearson and feel like you're in a restaurant rather than an airport. Didn't try their beer. Will have to next time."}
{"text":"Best airport breakfast experience I've ever had.  If you're stuck at YYZ  and need to eat or just want a killer beer... I recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I loathe snobbish waitresses. I also mildly dislike slow waitresses. Lucky me for getting to experience both in just one meal!

I was really longing for a burger, and since I'd already passed though security, Mill Street was my closest option. I was greeted by a hostess who seemed grimly determined about something. Halfway through my meal, I decided she was just trying to make it through the storm alive.

It was buzzing with activity, not jam-packed, but certainly busy. I ordered my cheeseburger and side salad from a smiling waitress who I can only describe as flighty. She flitted off to the kitchen and I pulled out my book to wait for my food. An older man sat nearby me and was quickly ensnared by one of my most dreaded restaurant foes: Over Enthusiastic Waiter Dude. The guy who wants to be your best pal, man, he'll make everything perfect for you, bro! He also ordered the burger, on the suggestion of the OEWD (It's so juicy, man!) We both received our meals at roughly the same time and we both seemed similarly impressed.

My burger was certainly not the juiciest of all time, but it wasn't dry as a bone. What was dry as a bone was the over-sized bun, which would have been a thousand times better had it not been toasted so much. It sliced away at the sides of my lips as I ate, which is always fun. Ow and damn. The salad, however, wasn't bad, other than the pale, under-ripe tomato wedged into the dish.

While I waited for my bill (which took FOREVER), I continued to read my book, lost in my own little world. Suddenly my bubble was popped by the loud, brash waitress my neighbour had. She informed me I had to move my purse from the seat beside me so someone else could sit there. Ah. Right. You're soooo busy that you're going to have to seat someone right beside me at the smallest bar here that faces nothing but wall. What's wrong with the other three free seats around me? Oh, and what's that? Your pal next to me can keep her bag up though, as she has some stupid airport gold star hot shot badge of specialness attached to the handle. A pox upon your house."}
{"text":"As far as airport bars & restaurants go, this one is pretty good. I ordered the chicken schnitzel sandwich and really enjoyed it - it was crisped perfectly, with not too much fry. The gravy was great; I recommend getting it on the side. Fries were also tasty, and the beer selection was solid.

Service was fast and friendly, and prices were fair. The TVs were playing hockey and it was great to be able to watch while eating and waiting for my flight to board.

Definitely the best option in this Terminal, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Decent burger place at T1 post security. Previously there was a sandwich counter here and I always wondered why they never had put a sit down restaurant near the gates in this section of the terminal. This was back 7-8 years ago and so done realized there was better money in converting that sandwich counter to a more established sit down restaurant. I had come with a group of guys flying out and we (as expected) gravitated to a place selling beer and burgers. We sat down, were served in a respectable amount of time and were served a frothy cold one in rapid succession. 

I ordered the BLT burger with fries. Some friends ordered poutine and they forgot to bring one out so they brought an extra that we shared. The burger was large and good as I was hungry. The poutine was not the best but still edible. Gravy texture was off and maybe I'm spoiled living in QC as it didn't really taste like cheese curds. 

A good quick place to come if beer and burgers are your deal. There is also lots of other sandwiches, salads and curious menu items to keep those picky eaters enthused."}
{"text":"The Mill Street Brew Pub is located in the Toronto, Canada airport.   Large open room seating with comfortable chairs and tons of bar seats welcome you.  The place is decorated in a lot of wood and rock tile.  Hostesses, wait staff, and bus people are very friendly and efficient.

Order the Fish & Chips!   They have one huge piece of whitefish deep fried in a beer batter.   Cooked till it is golden brown on the outside and tender moist on the inside.  Served with a home-made tartar sauce and malt vinegar.  The dish is served with home-made coleslaw and fresh cut fries!  Delicious!  Grade:  B+/A-

They have an extensive beer menu of about 15 different kinds of beers.  The bar staff (Eric!) was super friendly and suggested that I drink the Tankhouse Ale.  Locally made brew that was dark amber in color and super smooth.  Grade:  A-.

Tons of people are coming and going thru this restaurant.  I was fortunate to have sat next to Todd Warriner, Canada's 1994 Olympic Hockey Player (won Silver) and NHL player of Toronto Maple Leafs.  Super friendly guy.

Food Grade:  B+ / A-
Service Grade:  A!
Overall impression grade:  B+/A-"}
{"text":"This is a decent run-of-the mill restaurant at Pearson Terminal (behind security). I always come here when I have an early morning flight. 

It's just a regular breakfast at a little more then normal price $15.00. I've had the same server every time I've came here (Sadie). Sadie is both brisk & polite all rolled into one. The service is fast & efficient while maintaining a decent quality of food. I'll continue to come here. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Still the slowest bar/restaurant in the world...definitely order your check the same time you put in your food order.  The steak cobb salad was good for airport good but C$23....beers are like C$8ish each...bartenders this time we're cool but still very slow.  Beers are pretty good.  I'll go back only when I have at least 90 minutes before my connecting flight.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I was flying to Winnipeg this afternoon and had lunch at Mill Street Brewery.

My server, Cristina, recommended the Drunken Butter Chicken, which is on the holiday menu.  Excellent recommendation!  It was really good and I ate it all!  Cristina was friendly and helpful and too good care of me!  

When Gord and I had supper at this restaurant in July 2012, Renee was our server.  She was working today and I recognized her.  She has since gotten promoted to manager ... congrats, Renee!  She's still very friendly and we had a great chat.  Here she is ...

We talked about beer and she said I HAD to try to samples of their seasonal draft.  One was a vanilla porter, another was a German draft and the last was a hoppier draft (I was hoping they had them listed on their website because I couldn't remember the names but they don't.).  I'm not a fan of Porters but I didn't mind this one ... it wasn't as heavy as most.  I liked the German one too ... I found the third one too hoppy.  Renee gave me coupons so I can buy a couple vanilla porters at the liquor store.

This is a great place to stop in if you want to eat at the airport ... the food is yummy and the staff is friendly!"}
{"text":"Big fan! Had big breakfast here early one morning, and it came out fast! I was in and out in under 20 minutes. It wasn't busy, but wasn't empty either so was great to see how fast they were.
Normally i run to the Maple Leaf Lounge, but breakfast options are pretty slim in there. This is a great spot to wait for a flight in the morning and have a great breakfast. Much better than Molson's."}
{"text":"Friendly stuff, quick service before my flight, took the tuna burger and found it ok, tuna was overcooked, bun was crispy and salad did have enough dressing. I did not try any appetizer for lack of time. Overall average ."}
{"text":"Options in Concourse D are limited, but there are still better choices out there.

I stopped here for breakfast before my flight. The ambiance was alright, but the food was disappointingly bad (I got the steak & eggs), and the service was slow.

Next time I'll try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Dropped by for a quick lunch before my flight and boy are they busy! Went with their club sandwich and fries. Meal was alright but wasnt anything memorable. So much so I has to check my uploaded pictures to remember what I ate here. ;)

Service was pretty slow but I understand since it was rush hour but I would have appreciated not waiting 10+ minutes to pay but hey... that's just me.

Plugged the hunger hole so fit the bill."}
{"text":"This is a nice little pub located in Terminal 1 domestic departures.  the y have good home brews and a large selection.  Food was pub food and done well, its a nice distraction took while waiting for a flight."}
{"text":"Waiting to board our flight, we stopped in here for some breakfast and a beer. We kinda just walked in and sat down because there isn't a host desk or anything that tells you if you should seat yourself or wait for help. We waiting for a minute for menus. It didn't seem understaffed and there were definitely employees available but no one stopped to even toss a couple of menus at us. Ok. Finally, the bartender showed up and dropped off some menus but then she bounced. So, we look at the menu (which isn't big) and decide but we had to wait again for the bartender to come take our order. That was a wait and a half.

I ordered an omelette of some sort that was just ok. I'll give them a shout out on the potatoes because they were really good. Everything else was just ok. When they were able to start serving beer the bartender hooked us up with some samples, which was pretty cool. 

If I didn't want a beer, I probably would have gone to Tim Horton's and got a breakfast sandwich or something."}
{"text":"Perhaps my judgement is clouded because the airport is a large black hole of good food, service, and at reasonable prices.  This place almost seem oasis like.. ALMOST.  I came through the airport and lo and behold... plane delay of epic proportions (Thanks to a snowstorm).  So I realized my stomach wasn't going to hold out for 5+ hours of no food and so I started my search.  Most places contained extremely expensive premade food but Mill Street Brewery offered pub fare, freshly made-ish, and with a smile.  Was it affordable? Barely ... but considering a hummus with carrot and celery dip costs $7, it's VERY affordable (in GTAA terms).

I noticed all patrons ordering a multitude of drafts to numb the delay and the staff was just on hopping along with all the orders.  They never missed a beat.  Kudos to them as the place was packed.  Seeing how it was a pub like atmosphere, I ordered the fish and chips.  

Thanks to great speedy service, the platter arrived piping hot to the point where I had to eat the fries first because it was so fresh.  The fries were fresh too and nicely seasoned with salt.  It wasn't too pale and it could have been cooked a little longer but they were good decent fries and it took up about a third of the plate.  The 2 pieces of fish was lightly battered and crispy.  It wasn't too oily and the meat itself wasn't too thin.  It wasn't the best fish and chips I ever had but it's maybe one of the best hot plates dishes I've had in the Toronto airport.

Considering how dreadful GTAA used to be, this is a nice change of pace.  I hope more options come through here and not all of it 100% pub food.  It'd be nice to see some slightly healthier option that isn't just a chicken caesar salad."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a drink or quick bite to eat before your flight. Place is consistently busy but doesn't take long to get a seat"}
{"text":"The kitchen in terminal 4 (D20 area) is under renovation, so only dry overpriced sandwiches. The IPA was ok."}
{"text":"I just had the chicken tikka masala. Took forever to order. Before I ordered I asked my server if the chicken was breast meat. She told me it was. I think you know where this going. Fatty weird meat in tomato sauce. Yuck. Didn't come back to check on me until the meal was almost finished. At that point I was a little cranky. Now here's the amazing part - the server really wanted to make it better. She sent the manager over, they comped my meal and she apologized sincerely. Took a one star review and added a few more stars. Any airport restaurant where the staff care that much is ok with me. Also the beer was delicious."}
{"text":"Excellent service, but only so-so food. You're in an airport, so naturally you will be fleeced and over charged for anything and everything. 
I was here with a group of six, and were seated quickly, orders promptly taken and food duly brought out in good time. However, although not bad, the food wasn't anything special, unlike the Mill Street Brewery pub in the Distillery District.

I ordered a veggie burger with bacon as an option. It confused the waitress, but was worth it. The burger itself was very flavourful, but the accompanying fries were nothing special. Too greasy and soggy for my liking. I ordered gravy with the fries, and it came in a tiny little dish on the side. For an extra buck. 
Most of my group ordered the Angus burger, and all said it was overcooked and too dry. Not moist and tender like they were expecting. 

At around $25 for a burger and soda, it's typical airport prices. Not horrendously bad, but could have been a lot better. Next time I'm in Terminal One and looking for a bite to eat, chances are I won't eat here, but I won't say never again."}
{"text":"Been there twice on airport layovers. Service could definitely be friendlier. Food was so so. 3 stars as I imagine they are extremely busy!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a bite while we waited for our flight. Food was quick, which you'd expect at an airport restaurant. Had the Chicken Club sammich. It was pretty good but the chicken portion was a little lacking. Friendly staff. Had a bit of a wait for a table, but again, expected for an airport restaurant."}
