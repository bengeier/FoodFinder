{"text":"Worst service ever..Waited for an hour with family and friends, then the waitress came to give us a wrong order,  then waited for  another 10 minutes..That's when we decided to leave ...the waitress then  ran after us telling us that are food will be ready soon..No apologies ..nothing"}
{"text":"Ordered soup and fish&chips 
Soup - clam chowder - would have been excellent as it was thick and looked real good however it was cold and seems like it was warmed before serving in microwave as spots were hot others spoons were lukewarm or less 
Server did offer to re-heat re-serve but I lost the taste for it - not worth $6 
The halibut was done very well and the chips were as I would expect European cut - good 
I have also ordered some onion rings - will not do it again. 
In all - for the fish and chips only - very good 

Oh yes, upon asking for water - a cold full bottle of water arrived - I wish other restaurants will adopt"}
{"text":"Arrived Saturday at 1pm for lunch and the place was empty, it didn't seem like a good sign.

We were quickly seated and had out choice of any seat in the restaurant.  It seems nicely furnished which was good.  The server was great, inquired if it was our first visit (it was) can gave us a rundown of the menu with his suggestion.  Came back a few times to check up on the meal.

We got the platter for 2 (2 pieces of halibut, 4 scallops, 4 shrimp, calamari with fries and coleslaw).  The portion was good for 2 people, it was $30 which was decently priced IMO.  The food was good, but I wouldn't tell anyone to make there way here unless they were in the neighborhood and wanted fish and chips."}
{"text":"Great service. Well priced with the ability to substitute items. Good portion sizes. Grilled fish excellent. 11 year old opinion of the battered fish was \"delicious\"

Coleslaw was fresh without too much mayonnaise. 

Very clean.

Would go again for sure.

Need a more obvious sign! Was hard to find."}
{"text":"A Fresh Surprise

Captain Nemo's could quite easily be the best fish n chips place I've ever visited. I don't even know if the sign out front had the correct name. (I checked on the way out, the \"Captain Nemo\" part is so small, you can barely identify it.)

The interior is very nice, clean and simple. The decorations are quaint and cute. 

The service from our waitress was okay. She gave excellent recommendations and was very helpful when it came to the menu, but forgot to provide us with condiments when our food arrived. 

Speaking of food, the halibut was simply amazing. The best. I also loved the coleslaw (and I'm very picky about my slaw). The fries were neither here nor there. They were good, but nothing to write home about, so this would be the only area they could improve that would really send them over the top. I haven't tried anything else on the menu (yet!) I will be back!

To finish off, the owner is incredibly friendly. We started chatting with him as we paid the bill and mentioned how much we loved the food. He made us cappuccinos to thank us for our kind words. What a treat. You simply don't find people who are over the top in the customer service department anymore (or at least it's rare) but this fellow is a gentleman."}
{"text":"Terrific food at Nemos. I've been there for lunch a few times and have been very impressed. I shared a platter the last time I was there and it was very filling.

Lots of food. Good prices. And you can tell that the owner is extremely passionate about his business."}
{"text":"Extremely happy they did not name the place ~Little Nemo~

I came by shortly after Captain Nemo opened spring of 2012.
A sight for sore eyes as a Fish & Chips closed shop in Maple.
The place was so new, the owner's Family was still inside.
Young[very young ones] & Old were there as I ate.   3.5'd

The decor isn't astounding but it's thought-through modernized.
That's much different than other F&Cs where its more oldschool.
So oldschool even the dust and filth dates back to pre-historics.
The Tables/Benchs were a bit uniquely unusual interesting.
There was a TV showing their own Captain Nemo re-runs, zzzz.

I went fancy-pants to support a new local, Halibut & Chips($11.95)
It was a Lunch btw, so it's a bit outside by budgetary requirements.
Nice Chef presented me a very nice version of this classic meal.
Great portion of Fries. Same can be said for 'slaw. Tartar nice.
I did wish to have slightly bigger piece of Fish but then I always do."}
{"text":"Food is good, fries are ok, but the fish is kinda small in size, bigger pieces will be better"}
{"text":"I never had known about a fish and chips place in Woodbridge, and when I stumbled upon yelp when my mom was craving it I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome. To be honest, I wasn't expecting much, but going in it smelled wonderful. I was greeted by a very welcoming Italian man, I believe his name was Nino (from the receipt). The fish was crispy and a good generous portion. The fries were thickly cut and nice and crispy. I hate coleslaw, but I could tolerate this one (And that's saying a lot). Their clam chowder was pretty expensive in my eyes ($5.95) but once I opened the container, I realized why. I've been used to having good clam chowder (particularly from Earl's) but none with an abundance of clams as this one. I had a great experience picking up my food, pleasantly surprised at how amazing and authentic it tasted and will definitely be back. :)"}
{"text":"I usually drive to Bolton or Nobleton for fish and chips as there are really no decent places in Woodbridge, so imagine my excitement at seeing the sign for Captain Nemo in my neighbourhood. Well.....after visiting this place a few times, I'm back to doing the drive back to Bolton and Nobleton. 
It's not that the food is awful or that the service sucks...it's just that there are better places out there. I prefer halibut to haddock, so the price is always higher due to the choice of fish.....the halibut is moist, portion size ok, has good flavour. Chips (fries) are basic, nothing memorable......I've had much better. Coleslaw is ok. Our waiter told us the tartar sauce is homemade but in our party of 4, none of us like tartar sauce so I can't comment on it.
Don't get me wrong, the food is not awful.....it's just there are better places."}
{"text":"From the outside it really looks like nothing special, but that's ok, there was no plan to eat in the parking lot. Inside was quite nice and modern looking. I had called my order in ahead of time to save some waiting, I felt rushed on the phone and figured they were super busy. 

I arrived to an empty restaurant, Italy was playing in the Euro Cup shortly, and to my surprise they were actually super friendly in person. He asked if it was my first time there and gave me a take out menu. We got to talking about the upcoming Euro match and he offered me an espresso at no charge.

I was eager to try this place as previous reviews were quite positive and we like fish and chips and have yet to find a really impressive place to go. After I dug into these thick cut fillets I was impressed the size of the serving was quite good. The flavour was great and not too oily as is the regular issue we have with most places we have tried. The fish was nice and meaty not soggy either, also the batter to fish ratio was spot on. 

There will definitely be a return trip, and it was recommended we eat in as everything would be more fresh and taste even better, which is hard to believe it could because it was pretty good to start.  

You can't go wrong with high quality food and friendly service like Captain Nemo's provides, and I am looking forward to my next voyage."}
{"text":"Yay Captain!!  

Your Fish and Chips tasted so good

The batter is light and golden brown and not greasy at all

The Haddock ($9.95) is moist, flaky and fresh

The Chips so cripsy outside and soft inside and thanks for not over salting them

Your Homemade Tartar Sauce so plentiful and delicious

The restaurant so clean and modern

The staffs all so polite and soft spoken

I don't know why I am watching bowling on TV while I am eating fish and chips?

I definitely will be back!

Yay Captain!"}
{"text":"Wow, a great place in Vaughan to get authentic Fish and Chips. Crispy batter and a generous portion of Halibut. I just love that they take pride in filleting a generous portion of halibut, none of that paper thin stuff.  

I like my fish and chips with salt and malt vinegar  The fries are English style . So don't expect American style fries.  This is Authentic Fish and Chips  Perfectly created coleslaw, delicious tartar and seafood sauce.  I tried the batter fried shrimp and scallops. I really liked the scallops!

Ok I know your thinking I ate a lot but I tried one more thing, the clam chowder.  The  chowder is a must try for clam chowder lovers.  I couldn't believe the abundance of clams in the chowder and the nicely cut potatoes. Scrumptious with a bit of black pepper that I added.

When in Vaughan or just craving some Fish and Chips go visit Captain Nemo, it won't disappoint!"}
