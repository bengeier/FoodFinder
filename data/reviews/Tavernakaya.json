{"text":"I have to say - while at first I was taken aback by Madison's Restaurant Muramoto reverting back to their old menu, I had to find another place to get Japanese food that wasn't sushi (I actually hate fish and seafood believe it or not). This place did EXACTLY that - if not, even more. Get any of the yakitori and finish with the spicy miso ramen. SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"We got seated right away, but at one of the strange elevated benches in the middle of the restaurant. Not the most pleasant for my back, but there was no open spot to move to at the time. That kind of seating concept seems strange to me, but then again, I'm not hip so maybe I don't get it.

The okonomiyaki I thought was good, but I don't have any other experience to compare it to. It was very thick (they gave me a steak knife to cut it with), had almost a potato-y density to it. The miso ramen was meh, broth was decently flavorful but the noodles were way overcooked. Service, however, was excellent. 

I saw signs in the (clean) bathroom that they have DJs at night which also seems odd to me. The space doesn't conjure up a place conducive to music but see my \"I'm not hip\" comment above.

All in all, based on the prices and the A-OK level of food satisfaction I probably won't hurry back, but still wouldn't mind trying it again sometime."}
{"text":"My sister and I found Tavernakaya quite by accident on a Saturday afternoon. The Badgers had just beaten Iowa in an away game, which meant that all the bars downtown were packed to the gills with Badger fans watching the game on TV. Then the bars emptied and everyone went in search of food. EVERY restaurant we passed on upper State Street and all the way around the Capitol had lines out the door and 45-minute waits. And then, suddenly, here was Tavernakaya with nary a soul in sight. 

I had no idea what to make of the name (I belatedly got the Izakaya connection), so we turned to the chalkboard outside, which was advertising brunch. Hmm. The sis and I were starving, so we decided to give it a chance. We were immediately blown away by the crazy-cool interior--and by the fact that only one other table in the restaurant was occupied. 

We weren't in the mood for brunch and the sushi options seemed really pricey, so we opted for veggie fried rice and teriyaki chicken. Both were really, really good. The chicken was a stand-out because the sauce was light and flavorful--not like the thick, cloying stuff we've become accustomed to with a lot of Americanized Asian food. The chicken itself (thighs, which have SO MUCH MORE FLAVOR than breasts, hello) was crusted in black sesame seeds and yummy, yummy, YUMMY. 

Our waitress was really friendly and efficient. Overall, we had a very enjoyable lunch.

In summary, I don't understand why this place isn't packed. I think it may be an issue with the construction combined with confusion about what the restaurant actually IS. Better messaging/branding might be helpful. 

We'll definitely give this place another go."}
{"text":"This place has promise, but they have a lot of kinks to work out. Service was very slow, and they completely forgot to bring out one of our dishes, despite 2-3 reminders. We finally gave up after almost 90 minutes waiting for a pork skewer.Burger and steak were ordered medium rare, they came out well done and medium (at best), respectively. Udon noodles fared similarly: definitely overlooked and having out in the kitchen too long. The hangar steak was okay, but well overpriced for the amount of steak (and I am happy to pay $$$ for a good steak). The burger was very tasty, and would probably be great if it was actually medium rare. 

We shared several small plates with friends, and the pork buns and Korean fried chicken wings were pretty tasty. I'll give it another shot, but the folks here have to get it together if they want to survive the competition in the booming downtown Madison restaurant scene."}
{"text":"The yakitori is reasonable. Ramen is really bad, however. Clumpy noodle, flavorless pork, underdone (very, very runny) egg. I should have known better when I saw that their noodle comes from Umami. Bah! Broth was okay in consistency but uneventful in terms of flavor. Really it was mainly the noodle being the biggest let down. Buy your noodle from Sujeo instead of this Top Ramen garbage."}
{"text":"Their (spicy) miso ramen is incredible. Some of the best I've ever had- in the States and in Japan.

Other great options are the General Tso's chicken and their Fried Rice entr√©es.

There atmosphere is great, and the view of the Capitol doesn't get much better. Overall, this has quickly become one of my absolute favorite restaurants in Madison!"}
{"text":"I love Tavernakaya, but please note that I am reviewing all but their sushi, as I think the sushi is sub par for the Madison area (probably a 2 or 3 out of 5). 4 stars are for the friendly, attentive service and delicious food on the main menu. Most items are tapas style like a traditional Japanese izakaya. While not very Japanese (more Japanese-American fusion), the General Tso's Cauliflower is amazing, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, so even a cauliflower hater would like it (like my dad, who came along on my second visit!). The agedashi tofu is another favorite of mine. It's delicately breaded and fried and served in a flavorful dipping sauce. I also recommend the Curry Chicken Udon (not tapas), which is rich and flavorful, but not soupy like ramen. The cocktail selection is nice, if a bit on the sweeter side. Love coming here!"}
{"text":"I was excited for this place to open. Finally a Japanese menu that included everything... Sushi and pork buns and yakitori. While nothing was bad, nothing really stood out either. Which made the price tag a little cringe inducing"}
{"text":"Went tonight expecting a standard Asian fusion place, but we were happy with the outcome. We shared 6 dishes between four of us and it was the perfect amount of portions. The fried rice, and sushi were awesome. They also allowed us to hit up another bar as we waited (~20)."}
{"text":"Madtown roll and General Tso's Cauliflower were especially good. The paper menus were disgustingly dirty and should be replaced regularly. Otherwise all our dishes were flavorful."}
{"text":"Their food was solid but underwhelming for Asian fusion. Their most popular \"fusion\" dish was General Tso's Cauliflower which in my opinion was as good as any local Chinese takeout joint except it was cauliflower...for twice the price. Overall tasty but pricey and inauthentic. Definitely some great cocktails and hot tea choices though."}
{"text":"They recently started serving brunch here, which is lucky for us because the other brunch places in downtown were packed. The menu and the restaurant as a whole are very eclectic. I had bloody mary and a fried chicken sandwich served with greens on the side, and they were pretty tasty. They say that the food is served tapas style and meant to be shared, but this doesn't work as well for brunch food."}
{"text":"Good sushi but the yakitori chicken was flavorless as was the chicken in my miso soup. The umami noodles were very good. Drinks were small for the high price. For the overall price it wasn't worth it. Doubtful that we will go back."}
{"text":"The design of the place is great with small izakaya style booth.
The cocktails were also good especially the Tokyo Mule.
But that's it for the good reviews.
Unfortunately the menu is far from being Japanese. It mixes Chinese, Taiwanese, Japanese altogether with American style food... which is weird considering the restaurant main theme.
As for the food itself, the maki were okay but the Udon noodles were not very tasty and well overcooked. I also ordered a medium/rare steak which has at best medium and far from rare... and of course it cames with fries (good btw) but it is not what you expect in a Japanese style restaurant.
Overall not a very good experience!"}
{"text":"Tavernakaya  in downtown Madison Wisconsin: 

Atmosphere: Was great, the place overall is really nice and super modern. 

Service: Was really good. Servers were extremely nice and super helpful wen explaining everything. 

Food: Overall the food was good but it had many areas that it could improve. I felt that majority of the food was under seasoned but the spicy miso ramen had great flavor and a kick of spice. One dish that I thought needed improvement was the Popcorn Chicken (starter) it had no flavor and could have used some dipping sauce on the side. Also presentation overall could be much better. 

Overall: I'm willing to give Tavernakaya another try and see if the food has improved."}
{"text":"The food was well prepared and very good.  The atmosphere was good, but not too fancy.  Went for a birthday and glad we did!  Staff was very courteous and refilled drinks at exactly the right times."}
{"text":"A friend and I went there for lunch. The service was excellent and the restaurant is very modern looking, we cannot wait to come have drinks at the bar. 
I ordered two sushi rolls: shrimp tempura and salmon avocado. Those rolls are what I typically get at my favorite sushi place. However Tavernakaya's sushi is quite expensive and while not the worst I've had, definitely is no comparison to my favorite place mostly due to rolls having a mushy consistency, not holding together well and just did not taste like the best seafood. 

However, my friend got the Beef Noodle Soup and raved about it! And we ordered the fries, which are seasoned superbly with a chili powder and are served with a ginger aioli type sauce. I ordered my fries light on the chili powder but I could still taste it but it added amazing flavor. The fries and aioli sauce will make me come back, they were to die for!"}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. I was hoping for more of a twist on things. I had Tonkatsu and basically got Pork Katsu. With the play on the name I was thinking there would be a \"twist\" on the typical Katsu meal but there was nothing different about it and was more basic than I was looking for. The Dumplings were good and drinks were good as well."}
{"text":"Food fight restaurant with Asian theme. Good selection of vegetarian options. Avocado sushi was served on a warm plate that seemed right out of the dishwasher. It was strange, but still tasty."}
{"text":"I had the gyoza as an appetizer and you can tell from the great flavors that it's made in house. The cocktail I had was also very delicious!"}
{"text":"We went on a Friday night. The waitress explained the restaurant as a fusion between Japanese and a Wisconsin tavern. 

If 3.5 stars were an option that is what I would give them.
I ordered a Toyko Mule which had so much ginger I could barely drink it.  We decided to split some dishes. First we ordered the gyoza.  The pork dumplings were okay.  They had a lot of fluid in them which made them virtually impossible to eat with chopsticks. I dropped one of mine on the table but ate  it anyways.  Next we ordered the TKO sushi roll. It had bacon, pineapple, avocado and seared tuna. It didn't taste bad but with Muramoto around the corner you have to do better.  Next up was a pork belly skewer. Dry and boring.  Finally we got the Udon XO which was the best dish of the night.  It was flavorful and tasted like great lo mein.

The service was pretty decent considering how new they are.

Worth a second try but they need to up their game if they are going to survive on the square."}
{"text":"I agree with another reviewer that Tavernakaya deserves a solid four stars. I love the food here, though not all of their dishes will hit it out of the park. With that said, the tempura cheese curds are absolutely perfect and you should get them every time you visit. The miso is great, the sushi is decent, and the pork buns are wonderful. The gyoza is just ok, while the General Tso's cauliflower was surprisingly great - and this is coming from a meat eater. The service is a bit hit-and-miss however. Some days it's been perfectly acceptable. Last night when I was there, the waitress needed to be reminded that we had ordered certain items and was unreasonably slow. It's becoming a regular staple for me, though their wait staff needs to work on consistency."}
{"text":"We had a pretty poor experience at Tavernakaya this past Saturday night & I felt compelled to update my previous review. TK, I want to love you- I really do! My daughter and I had a fantastic dinner at Tavernakaya back in December, and thought perhaps the change in ownership had impacted the place. I was also SUPER excited to see what changes the new chef (formerly of Muramoto) would bring. Thus, my boyfriend and I decided to meet another couple there for dinner Saturday. We all looked at the menu beforehand because of various dietary considerations, and decided TK would be great. Also of note- the Restaurant Week menu, which apparently has some dishes on it from a menu they'll be debuting in March, looked delicious. 

We arrived at the restaurant and we were given menus that said \"Fan Favorites\" at the top. Um, okay. These menus were almost 100% different from the one on the website, and didn't even seem to cross over into the Restaurant Week menu. The sushi menu on the back was the same, for what it's worth. But none of *our* \"fan favorites\" (steamed buns, skewers, ramen, Togaroshi fries, udon noodles, tempura cheese curds) were anywhere to be found. We were extremely bummed and asked our server if we could possibly order off the regular menu; nope. Not even the fried rice we'd been looking forward to ordering? Nope. Huge disappointment. What about,maybe, the Restaurant Week menu? No.

We were left to navigate this fairly unappealing menu on our own. From there things just continued to get worse. Despite being clear about the order we wanted our dishes to come out, I got my food before any of the appetizers even arrived. The woman bringing the food was beyond disinterested in being helpful. I ordered the blistered shisito peppers and mushrooms (these were the best thing I had there but at $10 for just a handful of food- 7 shisito peppers in total with fried mushrooms barely more evident than a garnish- it was way overpriced). The food runner slammed the platter into the middle of the table; several mushrooms and a pepper slid off the platter onto a menu on the table; she literally watched the food slide off and then walked away saying nothing. Oh, well. Everything came out that way- just set down loudly in the middle of the table with zero regard for who ordered what, or letting us know what it was. My \"crab cake\" (one crab cake about 2.5 inches in diameter with a side of shredded cabbage and daikon for $13) was supposed to contain rice- I doubt it- it was seared on the outside and complete mush otherwise. it tasted like lukewarm tuna salad. The pork belly appetizer we'd requested (which came out after the entrees) could have been great- it was perfectly cooked but slathered in a weird five-spice-esque dry rub that hadn't been mentioned on the menu. The flavors were totally overpowering and didn't go with anything else. My boyfriend's General Tso's Chicken was way too sweet with no spice to balance, and the batter wasn't thoroughly cooked. By far the standout on the table was a really delicious red curry vermicelli with a confit chicken leg- we all had to laugh because it was hearty and filling at only a couple bucks more than either of my teeny tiny portions. 

What could redeem this meal? I had enjoyed my TK Mojito so I thought we'd all have one for dessert. Funnily enough, the 4 mojitos arrived and they were basically like green sugar water. There was no lime flavor to speak of (not even a lime on the glass), no sparkling water as the menu had said there'd be (and as my first one had), and no Thai basil flavor though the menu had also proclaimed that. When we spoke up, the well-meaning server offered to bring us another round on the house. She brought two. Oh well. 

Maybe next time, Tavernakaya?"}
{"text":"Hard to beat ramen and some of the best dumplings I've had in my life. Everything is awesome here from the music to the service (yes the bathrooms are clean and modern) but what really matters here is the food. The broth of the miso ramen was hearty and delicious. The broth in the dumpling soup tasted earthy and wasn't too salty which made it incredible. The general tso cauliflower was a meal I'd come back for again and again. The cauliflower was so perfect it tasted just like a protein. Perfect for the vegetarian.And last but not least the edamame which was a salty perfection of its own. Tavernakaya is doing some seriously delicious things and the cooks are executing perfectly!"}
{"text":"Went for late night on a Saturday with a group of friends, everyone loved the music, cocktails, and the general atmosphere. Came back for dinner had delicious fries, sushi rolls, and mochi ice cream. I'm not a stickler for tradition, so I enjoyed how innovative the rolls were. The \"MadTown\" even included tempura kale (wut?!). 

The only thing I would like to see is a smaller plate option for some of the entree size dishes and a more extensive list of sushi rolls. Overall an excellent addition to the square."}
{"text":"They had amazing sushi here!! We tried about 5 different rolls and they were all mouth watering! We started at this restaurant for our girls night, the staff were so accommodating. They went out of their way to get us 3 seats together at the bar, were so helpful with our food selection and just genuinely nice people! Will definitely come back the next time we are in Madison!"}
{"text":"I am 100% certain I am going to be dreaming about Tavernakaya's General Tso's Cauliflower until the next time I am in Madison. It was amazing!

I was in Madison for work and ordered take out from Tavernakaya for a quick lunch for my drive home. I ordered a Bento box with a cucumber roll and the G.T. Cauliflower. Unless someone told you that you were eating a vegetable, you wouldn't know. The dish is so flavorful and the consistency is almost meaty.

My pick up experience wasn't great. The restaurant is across from the Capitol so parking is tough. The hostess was a little abrupt with me. But the food was so good - I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Food is really good but may be overrated for the price. Our first trip was fabulous but by the second time it wasn't nearly as exciting or different. I'd typically give it a four but service is pretty slow, even when it's not busy. 

Be sure to try the bacon fried rice and shrimp udon noodles-- by far the two best things on the menu."}
{"text":"Yum yum fried chicken buns!! Such a cool Americano twist on the dish. We loved how the cabbage slaw and spicy mayo added to the flavor profile. My friend and I shared this dish, along with one sushi roll and an order of pork gyoza. The yellowtail scallion roll was just meh. I'm happy we added the avo for an additional 50 cents, but I wouldn't say that sushi is TK's expertise. I would definitely recommend taking the sharing approach at the restaurant, as the portions are mostly sized to mix and match. Plus if you're like me, you'll be happy to try a blend of dishes! 

Other than the food, we enjoyed the open air atmosphere! We sat inside but near the open floor to ceiling Windows. The service was fast and friendly, and you can't beat the Capitol view!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere in this place, u can come with friends and family or on an intimate date. The staff at the bar was super friendly and took the time to talk with me even though the place was super packed. Sushi tastes great here and was priced reasonably. I had some Japanese Stout recommended by staff after asking me what type of beer I liked. I will most definitely return on my next trip to Madison."}
{"text":"Tavernakaya is a good example of a restaurant you would not have seen in Madison five years ago - modern atmosphere, focus on Asian food, and both class and a patio. 

My Three Cup Chicken was very good - well-cooked, sizable portion, and just enough heat to be noticed. I didn't get to try anything else, but my dining partner liked his cauliflower curry as well. The bar program looked excellent, with a good focus on Japanese breweries that I hadn't tried before (though a tad expensive).

I don't remember anything in particular about the service, so it must have been fine. 

Tavernakaya wasn't 'best meal ever' great, but I'll be back without hesitation."}
{"text":"This place is a short walk from my apartment so I find myself here fairly often. I've been here for brunch, happy hour, and dinner and generally find myself leaving quite satisfied. When I came for brunch, my partner and I had the brunch ramen which was fine but just not quite as good as Morris. Given the choice, I think I'd choose Morris for ramen any day, especially since it's just down the street. 

For dinner, I've had the chicken katsu and veggie udon and they were both pretty tasty. The veggie udon in particular was chock full of veg and the noodles were cooked well. Service during meals is always good, they're fast and friendly, which is all I want in a server! 

I think happy hour is probably my favorite offering of Tavernayaka. Drink deals are good - I especially like the Chuhai (japanese highball) with grapefruit juice. It's only $4, it's strong and refreshing, and you get a lot for your money. The food deals during happy hour are also pretty good, I quite like Tavernayaka's seaweed salad and for $5 you get a really good sized portion of it. Definitely will keep coming back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"I don't get to the square much because I find it to be pricy; however, we were slated to have dinner here for a friend's bachelorette party and I think it was a great choice!  In fact, I told my boyfriend, who is a bit of a picky sushi guy, that I had to take him here.

They offer much more than sushi here, but that is what I ordered; so, that is what I can speak to mainly.

While some of speciality the rolls are on the pricier side, they are actually a decent size, as opposed to other places.  Even the regular rolls, which I found to be quite reasonably priced, were nice and \"meaty\" (i.e.: the Philadelphia roll, shrimp tempura, etc.).  I definitely left more than satisfied from my meal!!

My friends are vegetarian and they ordered the General Tso's Cauliflower.  I even tried a nibble and it was SCRUMPTIOUS.  They were beyond pleased with their selection.  

Our service was SO helpful.  It really eliminated a potential headache from our evening.  I really wish I could remember our server's name because she deserves a major shout out (and if I can find my receipt, I will come back and include her name....  I want to say it is Marie, but I am not 100% on that).  We had a rather large party and she let us know right away what to expect, which just made everything so much more smooth during and at the end of the meal.  They even did separate checks for us!  Simply amazing.  She was so friendly, accommodating, and prompt in her service.  I give her major props for handling such a large party with such ease.  She honestly made it seem effortless.

The ambience is stunning.  The art and decor make it feel so classy and romantic; so, I feel this would be a great date night or anniversary spot for sure.

I can't wait to bring my boyfriend here and show him why I was raving about it so much when I got home that evening.  He will now doubt be just as please as I was."}
{"text":"If you would like to experience authentic izakaya style bar, this is the place to go. Their food and sake was pretty good. I just wish they would have more extensive list of small dishes."}
{"text":"I've been a handful of times for lunch and no complaints about the food for me. General Tso's Cauliflower is super good. Don't forget to order the 'O.G.' Pork Buns, YUM! The only MINUS that could use some cleaning up is the wait staff attire. Way to casual! Crop tops and shorts on the young ladies should not be allowed. Step up the wait staff attire."}
{"text":"It's a fairly new Japanese restaurant in the \"izakaya (sp)\" mold, sort of like a Japanese analogue to the American diner, only with better and healthier dishes. You will find staples of that here, like ramen and meat on a stick (sorry, the name escapes me at this moment, but I don't want to lose my flow), plus some fusion stuff, like various buns. I found the pork bun absolutely... transcendent, along with the \"three cup\" chicken (soy and teriyaki kind of thing). (Not sure what three cup means, by the way -- three sauces? Three cups of something used to make it? Who knows.) The fried chicken bun was bland, however, along with the shrimp on a stick ($10 = $3 a tiny shrimp!!)

Atmosphere is trendy \"mood\" lighting."}
{"text":"First impression:
The hostess was disorganized and seemed stressed. She told us the wait time would be 25 minutes, so we headed out to walk around the square a bit. 5 minutes later, we got a text that the table was ready. After hustling back to the restaurant, she brought us to a table for two (we had 3 in our party). She did quickly find us a new table, though, which redeemed the mix-up.

The atmosphere:
This ambiance seemed cool from the entryway, but I didn't get a good look because we ultimately got seated in the booths in the back. Next to the kitchen. Not really the same \"vibey\" experience back there.

The service:
Our waitress was friendly and the food came out very quickly, but the rest was slow, especially waiting for the bill. We weren't in a hurry though, so we didn't mind. Our waitress admitted that our table wasn't in her section and profusely apologized. She offered us a free dessert to make up for it, but we were full so we declined. It was a nice thought, though.

The food:
The food was amazing. Get the cheese curds, you won't regret it - they're unique and delicious. I ordered a shrimp tempura roll with avocado and cucumber. The roll came without the avocado and cucumber, just the shrimp. But it was still AMAZING so I didn't send it back. Better than Red, tbh. I will definitely be back to try more of their sushi rolls. I also shared a general tso's chicken with my boyfriend, it was AMAZING and the portion sizes are MORE than generous - because the dishes are kind of meant to be shared. I also brought a friend who's vegetarian and she found plenty of options on the menu. 

Overall, I'm docking one star for the less-than-vibey atmosphere in the back of the restaurant and for the less than stellar service, but the food more than makes up for it. This would be a great place to take a date since the food comes out as it's ready, tapas-style - perfect for sharing."}
{"text":"My wife and I were venturing out on our first date since the birth of our daughter. So our expectations were a bit high and Tavernakya did not disappoint. It was their first Friday night since opening and there were some service related signs of being new. I think at least 3 dishes were brought to our table that we did not order, only to be immediately removed. But overall service was quick, attentive and friendly. 

And the food, so good. We ordered the chicken wings, steak and beef noodles. All excellent and just the right amount for two hungry, sleep deprived and overly excited to be out of the house adults."}
{"text":"I've come here twice in the last few weeks and liked it both times.  The Taiwanese popcorn chicken, pork gyoza (dumplings), general tso's cauliflower, hangar steak yakitori (skewer), & tempura shrimp rolls were all great. Nice beer selection too."}
{"text":"If I could give it a 3.5 I would. The space is really, really neat. On a warm summer night it's an awesome place to be! My boyfriend and I were a little put off at the location of the TV though. It cuts up the ambiance, I would have considered facing it away from the sidewalk.

Service was awesome. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the restaurant and menu. Food came out fast. My boyfriend was a little put off by the bartender though as he was not very friendly. We only sat at the bar for one drink so this didn't ruin our night.

Prices are definitely up there. An appetizer and a few small plates will put you over $20. Sushi is very expensive compared to what you can get at some other Madison establishments. My boyfriend had the Bacon and Egg Fried Rice. He said it was very good, though there were too many pieces of bacon that were just chewy pieces of fat. I had the Veggie Buns and the TKO roll. The Veggie Buns were very good, I really enjoyed the peanut/sriracha/miso combo. The sushi rolls were okay. I appreciated the tempura pineapple as I've never had it before. It was just as it sounds - sweet and crispy! There was far too much rice on the rolls however. It really muddled the flavors from the rest of the roll. 

I would still return and try it out again in a few months. Hopefully they dial down the prices a bit so you can try more for your money!"}
{"text":"I don't think restaurant was my kind of place. That doesn't mean that you won't enjoy it. I am not a sushi eater and it was hard to find anything else to eat on the menu. I Ordered the 3 cup chicken, and it was a large serving. I didn't care for the food because it was chunks of chicken in a soy sauce.  I have heard people say it is a good sushi place and perhaps that is where the restaurant excels.  I was not given a choice to eat inside or out, and I ate inside feeling like I was eating at a minimally decorated fast food place.  The bright star was that service was very good."}
{"text":"I have not eaten dinner at this place, but recently went to one of their late night events with DJ Boyfriend. Tavernakaya is a beautiful place and they have a great location. My friends and I were pretty impressed with the atmosphere and were looking forward to spending the night there.

Our moods quickly soured when we approached the bar for drinks. We were completely understanding that the place was extremely busy and that we'd have to wait to put in an order. However, their bartender continued to pass over us and instead served people who had not been waiting long. At first we thought it was just an honest mistake and he didn't see us, so we were a bit more assertive and flagged him down. When he finally came over to us minutes later, he took our order and we thought we were all set. Next thing you know we notice him move on to other people and he never made our drinks. 

We continued to stand there for at least another 10 minutes, repeatedly watching him serve other customers before us and completely ignoring us. We are still perplexed as tow hat we did to deserve this treatment, but needless to say, it put an extremely bad taste in our mouth.

Another friend of ours, who did manage to get a drink, let us taste his whiskey ginger. For a somewhat upscale looking place, we were all shocked that this was the absolute worst whiskey ginger we had ever tasted. We promptly left disappointed and confused. 

I'd be willing to give it a second chance by visiting them during a less crazy night and try their dinner. But for now, I cannot give Tavernakaya more than 1 stars based on the poorest treatment I've ever received in Madison."}
{"text":"So this is a mixed review. The waitress was not good. We sat at the sushi bar and everyone was getting service except for us. At about 10-15 minutes of waiting we talked about leaving. The guy making the sushi saw that we hadn't had anyone to see us. He got our waitress and got service. They gave us a free night time appetizer for the wait. The popcorn chicken is really good. We had sashimi and a couple of rolls. The food was very good. We had to remind our waitress that we got soup. Overall everyone was very nice and welcoming. The food was so good that it is  worth another try. We will go in the evening. Nice atmosphere. No low sodium soy sauce but they are new."}
{"text":"Disappointing.

I had really high hopes for this place, but everything we tried was disappointing. The salad we had was drenched in dressing. The fried chicken buns were too salty, and the sushi roll we ordered was not good.

I visited their second week of being open, so would maybe try it again once they work out a few of those kinks.

Service was good."}
{"text":"Came here on a week night. The space is nice and open. I'm a big fan of the minimalist decor. The menu consists of small and large plates, some sashimi/maki options and also some yakitori items. My party ordered a variety of appetizers and yakitori and large plates. We ordered the pork belly buns, the samurai ribs, popcorn chicken, also the pork belly, shittaki mushroom and short rib yakitori. For mains, we got the miso ramen, the beef noodle soup, the tempura udon, the bacon and egg fried rice and the tonkatsu.
The pork belly and popcorn chicken were definitely the favorites here. They use dark meat for the popcorn chicken, which is great! The five spice on it is nice, though on certain bites it's heavier than others. The pork belly buns were good, though more bun than pork belly, a slight disappointment. As for the rest of the small plates, well, they definitely emphasized \"small\". Each yakitori came with two small skewers, not the thin skewers you think of when you grill out, but the short stubby skewers that keep your burger in one piece. Each skewer offers literally one bite of food, except the shittaki mushrooms, each skewer came with 4 mushrooms! Wow, that's like 400% more per stick! The large plates/noodles were kind of the same deal. The noodle soup was small on portions and everyone wanted more broth in their soup. The flavors received no complaints, just portion sizes. The fried rice was greasy, as in, greasier than your average chinese take out restaurant greasy. The bacon gave the whole dish a smokey flavor, but on some bites, it was too smokey, so not sure what the prep process is. The tonkatsu was definitely the portion size winner. Nice piece of pork with a side of curried vegetables and bowl of rice on the side. 
Overall, this place is ok. Definitely much room for improvement. The dollar to portion ratio is disappointing, considering they rival San Francisco prices with smaller portions, and this is Madison! The drinks were good all around. So maybe this will be more of a drinking destination rather than a food one."}
{"text":"The seaweed salad was really good. One the better one's I've had. I enjoyed it a lot. The eel roll was average and not worth $18 for the 10 pieces in my opinion. I got a takeout but the vibe at this place was nice, and staff were helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"So.... went into tavernakaya know as TK from the madisonians on a Sunday because my homie said he had a lit Friday night there with a fly ass house Dj and it was a big dance party. I went in and went right to the bar to get a mimosa because I love cherub but I tell you what the mimosas selection was mind blowing I can't even pronounce the options. The bartender that was this spicy 100 pound smoke show that her voice reminded me of Fran Drescher which made my knees weak because I love the nanny. She recommended the biscuits n gravy and it was amazing! After trying 5 mimosas I worked up a appetite and got the bacon fried rice it was what wet dreams are made of I also got one of their specialty drinks I can't remember what it was I think it was called some Japanese name like anime. The little honey dip of a bartender kept calling me babe so I stayed because I felt she was feeling me  but two dudes sat at the bar one with Jesus wild hair and the other looking like he didn't sleep the night before and she called them babe as well so womp womp. I'm giving this place 5 stars because it has a very nice ambiance, bomb food, boss playas and hot modern goth waitresses  everywhere."}
{"text":"Honestly, the sushi was just a bit better than the grocery store. We had the $21 Fuji roll. Not worth the money and lacked flavor. The noodles were greasy. Don't mind spending $100 for dinner if it was good. We ended up getting a slice at Ian's after the show because we were still hungry. Expected more from a Food Fight restaurant."}
{"text":"My partner really wanted to try Tavernakaya. Every time we walk by, it is always packed. The menu sounds so tasty. So despite an average first impression, I decided to go back. I doubt there will be a third visit.

The visit started off well. We were seated immediately. The tables are very close together, but that can be a plus as it allowed us to check out what our neighbors on either side were eating. Everything looked and smelled amazing. Our waiter was very friendly and described the izakaya concept. I was a little concerned perusing the dinner menu as the prices seemed rather steep for small plates, but I was game to try. When we ordered our beverages and dishes out waiter assured us that these were his favorites too. Our drinks arrived promptly and they were delicious. They were also rather tiny considering the big-city prices, but I was going to do my best to ignore that.

Once the runners started to bring our dishes, my opinion just continued to plummet. First up, beef short ribs. Two skewers with two bites of beef per skewer. They were pretty, they smelled great, the flavor was delicious, but once you bit into it, watch out! Gristle through-out. I chewed and chewed. I just needed to chew it enough to be able to swallow it otherwise I'd have to spit it out. Worst texture ever. Not a good beginning. Next up were the shishito peppers. This was actually my favorite course. Six tiny grilled peppers. I have no complaint about this dish except there's a place in Iowa City where they are just as good and they serve twice as many peppers for half the price. 

By this time, my tiny drink was empty and I was hoping to order another one. A glass of water would also have been welcome. I started keeping my eye out for our waiter.

The runners continued to bring dishes. Third course: pickled vegetables: kimchi, pickles, daikon radish, and shredded carrot. The pickles and carrot were fine. I'm not a fan of kimchi, so I won't hold that against them. The daikon was horrible. I generally like pickled vegetables but this had an almost rotten flavor. Next up was General Tso's Cauilflower. This was a pretty dish and a decent portion size. The sauce smelled and tasted quite good. But the breading was thick and soggy and the cauliflower overcooked. Another let-down. Finally we had the Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken. I had high-hopes for this from looking at our neighbor's table. Again it was a nice presentation. But after biting into one, yet another disappointment. If you are a fan of 5-spice powder you might enjoy this. But if not, stay away because that was all I could taste. 

At this point, our long-lost waiter came by to check on us. He wanted to know if we would like to order more dishes or perhaps dessert. But frankly, by this time, I had given up on that second drink. I had given up on getting water. I just wanted to leave as quickly as possible.

The check did come quickly. We paid it and left. I doubt I'll go back."}
{"text":"Tavernakaya is a new and very modern Japanese Izakaya-wanna-be (personal guess from the name and the style of the place) on the square.

I have been there for dinner once but didn't get a chance to write a review and now that I went there again for lunch, I decided to give my two cents.

Firstly, their lunch menu has a number of options, including Japanese inspired sandwiches/burgers, ramen, sushi and maki combos and rice plates. However, I don't think find their choices particularly special and worth trying. We ended up trying one of the ramen and some sushi combo.

The ramen was decent, the broth and the noodles are well done but the chasiu is lacking. The sushi was well okay, the quality of the sashimi is okay, however, the rice fell apart as soon as it was picked up. This should be looked at.

Also, I am not sure I understand why they include Taiwanese/Chinese inspired dishes on the menu... Not sure what they are trying to focus/sell as a restaurant. If it's just another Asian fusion place, I guess I am not that bothered."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and concept. What a beautiful and welcoming place. The menu is a delight, it doesn't often happen that I come across this many options that I'd like to try. 
Highlight for me was the ponzu steak with frites, incredibly tender and tasteful steak. Mushroom skewers were another highlight, with a delicate taste of their yakitori grill. 
I was delighted to see that their amazing buns from Umami made it onto the menu. Prices are very fair. 
Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to TK last night for a drink and ended up staying for food. The bartenders were friendly and attentive and gave us some great whiskey recommendations. We ordered the yellowtail scallion roll, seaweed salad, and Taiwanese popcorn chicken. All 3 dishes were tasty, but the chicken and seaweed salad were our favorites! We wished we still lived in Madison so that we could eat at TK more often! Don't be deterred by the bad reviews - give TK a chance - I'm glad I did!"}
{"text":"Good but terribly overpriced. Don't get the sushi or sashimi because you barely get enough to satisfy your hunger. Other items were good but again everything is a la carte and things got pricey at lunch."}
{"text":"This is a super cool place in the middle of everything in Madison! Would totally visit again. The spider roll was delicious. The staff is friendly and attentive- even on a very busy night. Favorite part about this joint? THE BEER. They have such an impressive line up of Japanese beers!"}
{"text":"Found another new favorite Madison bar! I think I overlooked this place due to all the Capitol Square road construction; which, as we noticed last night is all done!

We walked by twice and commented on how much we enjoyed the justice the DJ was playing and decided not to pass it up again. The place was noticeably slow, maybe it's still so new? Sat out on the patio after midnight with our drinks. The bar staff was very friendly and could be seen walking drinks out to guests, not just waiting up at the bar for you to order.

I don't think I've ever watched more than one round of sumo wrestling, but they had it on the entire time and I couldn't look away. Can't wait for this place to really catch on, I'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Tavernakaya is a new favorite for the food and atmosphere. It looks like it attracts great nightlife too, but I haven't experienced that yet. 

Some highlights include:

- Pork buns: another flavorful version available in Madison
- Take: I can't get enough fish with rice ever. The California roll is the best I've had--and I'm totally against the idea of the Cali roll!
- TK Inferno Set: The scallop roll was surprisingly delicious. So sweet and simply complex.
- Korean Chicken Wings: Thick crispy outside with juicy inside and Korean vinegar wing sauce.
- Miso Ramen: Comfort in a bowl. The handmade noodles are excellent. 
- Spiced Moscow Mule: Yaaasss! 
- Seaweed Salad: I hesitate to put this on here, but it's a nice, unique take on the standard seaweed salad. 

Misses:

- Popcorn Chicken: Nice spice flavor, but they're really dry and basic.
- Pork Belly Skewers: Awesome flavor! But two bites for $8????? NO! 
- TK Bay: The scallops were wonderfully sweet, but this roll turned out mostly like cole slaw. 

The service at Tavernakaya has been excellent! Boris and Trevor both rocked it when we were in. Enough good food and a great atmosphere to keep me coming back!"}
{"text":"Really love this place! The food is the best; especially try the popcorn chicken. I would come here everyday if I could. If you go here, be sure to *share* different foods with a group of friends/family if you want to try many dishes! The atmosphere is fun and exciting - my boyfriend thought the music was too loud, though, but that's just his opinion. The service is very good. For some reason the servers have decided to have a gothic, black theme going on with their outfits - If they like to wear that, that's fine, but I don't know if it's necessary to be so matchy? It makes me nervous that a boss may be forcing weird fashion styles on their servers. 

Really great place. I always recommend it to anyone that visits Madison."}
{"text":"I had heard mixed things about Tavernakaya, but ended up loving it. Everything was really delicious. The tempura cheese curds were good, the bacon fried rice was delicious, but the general tso's cauliflower was LEGENDARY. It's been a week since I ate it and I can't stop thinking about it (and I'm not necessarily crazy about cauliflower in general). ORDER IT! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This was a fun tapas-style asian fusion bar. Drink prices were around average for Madison - expect to pay around $5 for a beer and $8-10 for cocktails. The food was delicious. but there isn't as much by way of serving size as you might expect for the price.

The dishes are all appetizer-sized, and good for sharing between two and four diners. Each appetizer is very good, including the (very delicous) french fries, the fresh-tasting sushi rolls, and the perfectly cooked teriyaki skewers.

This spot is definitely worth your time, if you are looking for a fun night out on the town and are hungering for some Japanese-inspired asian fusion cuisine. There are nice beers on tap and delicious cocktails for purchase. Don't expect a cheap dinner, though."}
{"text":"This place was surprisingly good. The atmosphere was really nice and quaint. The decor was really cute! There was a really wide array of food to choose from and the prices weren't even bad! I was surprised that one roll is 8 pieces, it's pretty good! The sushi tasted fresh and good, too. 

Although, I will say the menu is a tad confusing. For example, a salmon roll is about like 6 dollars and adding spicy mayo is a 50 cent charge, but a spicy salmon roll (which presumably is just a salmon roll with spicy mayo) is $7? The ingredients are questionably listed in the menu but it's a little hard to understand because I feel like they don't actually describe the items completely. Also, maybe some ingredients are omitted for no reason. 

My friend did not like their meal. I think they got some sort of fried udon? She said it was much too greasy for her and she hardly ate it. I didn't try it myself, though. 

Overall, I thought the atmosphere was really nice and made the restaurant seem like a high end, expensive place to dine but it was really actually pretty affordable! Food and drinks were good, service was stellar and quick. I would come again!"}
{"text":"This is a really great new addition to the square and a very fun concept. Our party shared all of the dishes, and the ones that really stuck out really stuck out. The popcorn chicken is way more enjoyable than the name suggests because it has a great intense flavor and isn't greasy like usual popcorn chicken tends to be.

Personally, my favorite (that I totally could have kept all to myself) was the three-cup chicken entree. It was flavorful, had plenty of sauce, and I was able to alter the order (vice of mine) to include excellent Umami Ramen ramen noodles instead of rice. While I've been meaning to try the iconic version of this dish at Natt Spiel, I think they now have some competition!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice already during their opening week.  So far everything I've tried has been pretty good.  Chicken wings, pork buns, spare ribs were solid.  The best thing on the menu is there three cup chicken.  I can just order that as my meal and be very happy.

I would go back and would recommend folks to try."}
{"text":"Tavernakaya was okay.  The restaurant itself is quite nice, with a lot of interesting design elements.  It's perhaps over-designed, but provides a fun environment.

The food, unfortunately, left us a little underwhelmed.  Everything was cooked perfectly, but lacked flavor.  With every bite, I wondered why the food lacked seasoning or any depth of flavor.  Nothing really made me think, \"Wow, this is so good, I want some more.\"  Some dishes just need a little more salt.

The Fried Chicken Buns were fine, but overpowered by the spicy mayo.  The Beef Short Rib Yakitori was far too chewy for my liking, though the Chicken Thigh Yakitori (although laking a bit in taste) fared better.  The Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken was one of the better dishes, but again was just a little under seasoned.  Even the General Tso's Chicken was rather bland compared to the standard variety, and far more expensive.

I also take issue with the mixed drinks.  They were overpriced, and some came in dainty little glasses.  If I'm spending $8-12 on a mixed drink it needs to come in a standard-sized glass, and it needs to not be watered down.  The drinks were really weak, and overly sweet.  Just go with the saki.  

Some in my group tried the Maki, which they seemed to enjoy.  It looked amazing.

The place was pretty crowded and loud on a Saturday, which is to be expected.  Service, as a result, was a little slow.  Our server was very nice, and comped a couple of items due to in-house errors.

Bottom line:  This is a Food Fight establishment.  Which means you'll quite often get a good meal, but rarely a great one."}
{"text":"Went for restaurant week lunch. The 3 of were seated right away. Service was very quick despite it being crazy busy. Everything was very good. Would definitely try again."}
{"text":"Wonderful sushi, fabulous tea, and a thoughtful staff with excellent customer service!  My friend and I split a miso soup and entree and without prompting the waitstaff brought us it split in two separate bowls.  The venue has an updated, urban rustic and minimalistic look.  Additionally enjoyed all the colored hair on crew!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try Tavernakaya! I'm a big fan of izakayas and from the pictures I'd seen of the place, this was an interesting take on Asian fusion. I was especially keen on trying to the albacore ponzu, as there were beautiful pictures of it on Instagram!

The restaurant itself is beautiful. The aesthetics are pretty wonderful and it has a big-city feel you won't find in a lot of restaurants in Madison. I was impressed with now nice everything looked -- and how packed the restaurant was early on a Thursday night.

We ordered the Satori to start, a yummy cocktail made of sake, pomegranate liqueur, orange juice, and cardamom syrup. Sweet and delish. We got the Albacore Ponzu -- but they were out of albacore, so we got salmon instead. My dining companion loves salmon, so this was a good development for us! We also got the Korean Chicken Wings as a starter. The salmon was beautiful and delicious, but nothing special. The Korean Chicken Wings were sweet and did not have much \"Korean\" flavor to it.

Then, we both ordered a spicy miso ramen for dinner. I absolutely looooved that it was actually spicy, which is a rarity in Madison. But the spice overpowered any flavor and the broth ended up just tasting spicy and had minimal flavor.

Our server was very nice and attentive. She recovered well from a snafu with some dropped water glasses and made sure our water glasses were full the whole night. One thing that was problematic about the service: the placement of the tables near the windows was quite tight. That meant there was very little space between our table for two and the large party behind us.  The waitstaff kept bumping into my chair and it became problematic, as there was no place for me to hang my purse (it kept getting bumped off the chair). The table behind us didn't seem too thrilled about the arrangement and it seemed as if there was a better way to space out the seating so that the waitstaff didn't have to squeeze through small spaces and the patrons could eat without smashing into one another.

Overall, I still think the Salmon Ponzu dish was beautifully plated -- and the ambiance and decor are stellar. But the actual food itself and the issues with seating were enough to make me turn elsewhere for my Asian fusion meals."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at this place was good and I really like the concept of having a wide variety of foods. The service was polite and prompt. The noise level was perfect, a light buzz of conversations but quiet enough that I could easily speak with the people I was with. 

The great: they have a fried salmon skin roll that sounds a little unappealing at first, however I took my chances and ordered it. It was phenomenal, like eating a very thin crispy bacon in a roll. It gave the roll a crunch and added some interesting flavors. 

The not so great: I ordered the spicy ramen with pork belly and infused egg. The broth was not very spicy and I needed to get a side of sriracha. The pork was a little bland and the infused egg was weird. It was completely brown and the yolk was a gelatinous brown. The flavor was okay ( mostly salty like a pan dripping gravy type taste after cooking pork or beef) but the texture when eating wasn't good and put me off to the rest of the dish. It probably is an acquired taste. 

Recommendation: I would char the pork tenderloin or switch to crispy pork belly and either do a normal egg or flavor it with something else to offset the already brown and salty dish. To add more flavor I'd consider simply poaching a normal egg so the yolk mixes with the noddles (I think it looks more dramatic and tastes better). I'd also consider replacing the bamboo shoots with straw mushrooms or something else ( all they did was absorb the miso broth flavor and didn't add much to the dish).  

Overall I'd come here again for the sake and sushi."}
{"text":"Two stars go to the environment and the service. The food is so bad, not authentic and very salty. We had the Taiwanese popcorn chicken-not seasoned well, meat is too dry, should be more spicy and can't taste the basil here. It's the worst Taiwanese popcorn chicken I have ever had in my whole life especially considering the price.
Chicken meatball skewer-too salty, too dry
Curry pork rice-we ordered Japanese bbq sauce, not it is sooooo bad....
Ramen---seriously? You call that ramen? I bet that noodle is less than 99cents, comes from the frozen fridge. And too salty, the meat is tasteless, soup has no taste. 

The only good thing we had is the tea, the tea bag worth the money, everything else----never go there. 

So disappointed...my first Yelp comment, I don't mean to be rude but the food is very bad, but environment is very good and staff is very friendly. 

I'd rather buy a instant noodle for 99 cents and eat it at home, trust me, its better than the food in here."}
{"text":"Love this new Madison spot for the food, drink, and unique ordering style it brings to town. They have a \"order as you go\" style which means you're constantly ordering different courses. They have a variety of options, from ramen, to traditional Chinese entrees, to sushi so you can get a variety of food in one sitting. The wine list also had some very reasonable bottle options as well. I'd love to come back here and sit at the bar. Pro tip: try the basil chicken, it's amazing."}
{"text":"This place did not disappoint! Craving sushi and decided to try this place out and so glad that I did. It's the cutest little place on the square right by the capital. It has outdoor seating which is a plus so you can have lunch/dinner with a view. Very nice hostess and sat us down right away.


Our server was amazing! I love when you come to a restaurant the first time and the server asks if you've done with them before and that's exactly what he did. He explained the course concepts and did the best job recommending items on the menu. 

Ordered the Saut√©ed Veggie Udon, Spider Roll and the MT Fuji special roll. Everything was just so delectable! Highly recommend the MT Fuji roll to anyone who loves spicy tuna like I do! 

Our server kept checking up on us which was awesome and he also helped assist my friend who didn't know how to use chopsticks that well. Talk about friendly service. Definitely will be coming back here often!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at 4pm on a Friday and thoroughly enjoyed each item on the menu of specials. Try the O.G. Pork Buns. Pillows from heaven."}
{"text":"The most positive aspect of this restaurant is the decor. The clean lines, high-top wood tables, dark wood accents and other design elements are attractive, as is the view of the capital. 

The food was okay. Many of the lunch items are fried, this is WI, I get that, but it isn't very Japanese (or Chinese). I had sushi, my meal arrived 10-15+ minutes after my compatriots, which was a bit awkward. As a former service industry worker (and someone who eats at restaurants), I thought this was strange/unprofessional.

Additionally, server forgot the miso that accompanies the meal--I was too sheepish at that point to ask for it. The sushi itself was unimpressive overall, but the eel/tuna tasted fresh (I found myself longing for Muramoto's lunch roll combo). 

Overall, I like the idea of this place--it's not really an izakaya (izakaya's are more like Japanese tapas--you share plates, relatively inexpensive, etc.). This is more of a Japanese/Chinese/American fusion restaurant with Japanese decor and overpriced food. Maybe I should temper my expectations, I was hoping for a more traditional izakaya.

Positives: Togarashi spiced fries. Togarashi on anything is my favorite and the fries did not disappoint. My friends liked their lunches (tofu curry and cauliflower general tso's--but again, both of these items are fried).

I will give it another chance and I hope they get their stuff together."}
{"text":"I have been to Tavernakaya several times and always had a good experience- I decided to stop by for restaurant week to delve further into their menu & it did not disappoint! Tavernakaya has great food at reasonable prices. It also has a cool & hip environment that's great for date night or lunch with friends. Service was attentive and helpful too.

We began with their tempura cheese curds which I think are some of the best in Madison due to their unique preparation and delicious spicy mayo. We also tried the tofu buns- they were good, but I much prefer their pork buns I've previously tried because they're much more flavorful. 

For main courses, my table mate and I split the spicy miso ramen and general tso's cauliflower- both were delicious & I would highly recommend them! We were very impressed with the flavors of the ramen broth. Another one of my favorite entrees here is the three cup chicken. 

For dessert we enjoyed the Mochi ice cream balls with coffee ice cream and the triple chocolate cake. The cake was great. As for the Mochi ice cream balls, we enjoyed the ice cream but weren't huge fans of the rice ball they come in (this could definitely just be our flavor preference though.)

Overall, the food was great and introduced unique flavors. Though I'm not a vegetarian, this place does have a lot of great non-meat options which I love!"}
{"text":"My friend and I visited this place during restaurant week. First off, it was a 20 minute wait which was understandable. They said they would call me whenever a table is ready and we could walk around. 30 minutes passed and no call so we decided to go back and check up on the wait. They didn't acknowledge the wait and just sat us. No problem. Now, we've been waiting for 15+ minutes to be served. A waitress came by to pour us soy sauce but never returned. Didn't even get glasses of water. We've tried to get their attention but they either don't see us or pretend to not see us. Service was just awful overall. There were waiters who are just standing around. Food was aight too."}
{"text":"Meh, just meh. It gets a bonus star for ambiance and service. I was cautiously optimistic about trying this place-the reviews were pretty hit or miss but everything looks so yummy! And sounds so yummy! And I love all things noodles, rice, sushi, dumplings-how on earth could this place disappoint? Well it sure did. Nothing was bad but nothing was great. Everything just kinda missed the mark for me. Food was cooked pretty well (shared a few of the small plates) and the tuna/avocado roll was fresh but the overall flavors just lacked that certain something that makes me want to come back. And as others have noted-waaaayyy overpriced. That was easily the least satisfying $75 meal (for two...and we didn't eat that much. We had planned on ordering more but just didn't after being unimpressed. But how on earth we dropped $75, I don't have a clue).

My bf is keen on coming back (maybe because we just booked a trip to Tokyo and he loved the lanterns?) to try the ramen or other large plates but without his enthusiasm, I doubt I'd return. Well, maybe to sit in the open air section on a warm summer's night."}
{"text":"My first time at Tavernakaya was with a work group. I tried one of the bento boxes and absolutely loved it. Delicious and just the right amount of food for lunch. Great staff who took good care of us. Loved the vibe at this place so looking forward going more often!"}
{"text":"Really great food, service and atmosphere. I am a total fan of izykaya, am excited that Madison offers that on the capitol square. The only thing is it's a bit pricey of what it is. Otherwise it's a perfect experience."}
{"text":"Lovely space. Attentive service. Way overpriced.

8 dollars for a few slices of seared tofu? really?"}
{"text":"Why did I not come here sooner?  We decided to try the New Year's Eve 5 course dinner menu.  For $35 it seemed like a bargain.  We were not disappointed.  The food was outstanding, the service was excellent, and the ambiance/decor was spot on.  The miso soup broth was out of this world.  The salmon sushi was incredible.  The whole meal was one of the best I have had.  I don't hand out too many 5 stars, but Tavernakaya definitely earned this one.

I'll be back soon to try more!"}
{"text":"So, I've been stalking this place for months waiting for it to open. Seriously. And I'm so happy to see it finally open!! What a gorgeous restaurant! And great food! I can tell already that they will be a wonderful addition to the Madison food scene. 

First up, the atmosphere: It's beautiful inside. It feels like a place you'd want to hang out. More tables than bar space, but that works considering their menu! Asian themed without being too in your face or stereotyping.

The drinks: I loved the Tokyo mule! Just the right amount of spice for me, with the fun choice of soju instead of vodka. I also got the mono no aware, which was good too, but perhaps a little too complex to have with dinner. Lots of good flavor layers. Andrew at the bar was very nice and checked in with me to make sure everything was good.

The food: Woo! All your favorites from Umami are here too! The classic pork buns, renamed the \"o.g.\" pork buns here, accurately, are still on point. I tried to get the new and different options though, so I left the awesome ramen for another day and sampled the korean spicy wings (split with another), the chicken bun (split), the sashimi, and the beef noodle soup. Amazingly, it didn't end up being too much food... Not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but definitely good for this trial experience! 
The crispiness of wings was very good, but could have just a little more time in the marinade. The chicken bun was very yummy, but... I think I would choose the pork bun over it. How can you pass up those pork buns?!?!? Definitely worth getting though, and now I'm considering a future where I just get buns for dinner... The sashimi was good, but a little expensive for my tastes. 6 pieces for $16 is a hefty price tag, even though they were fresh and good sized pieces. Finally, the beef noodle soup. Pretty good! Udon noodles, to me, aren't exactly the right noodles to go with that soup (I prefer skinny noodles) but the broth was very good. I was hesitant since the menu mentioned some spices I don't normally associate with beef noodle soup, but it was very well balanced!

The service: The one drawback to our experience. Not that this was bad service at all (but my friends also tell me I'm too nice about this sort of thing, so be your own judge)! Seems like they've just got some kinks to work out. Our group of six first got seated at the sushi bar. Okay, cool view, but kind of odd because then we couldn't actually talk, so we requested to change to a table, which they were very nice about. The ordering was a bit hapazard--my side of the table ordered appetizers and the other side ordered their full meals, which we figured out after a little while and caught up on ordering, but that meant our food came out at weird times. There also was some confusion on what we ordered and who ordered what; one of my friends got served another table mates' order and proceeded to eat it, thinking he misordered, and we only discovered the mixup when his original entree showed up. Again, they were very nice about it and comped the meal of the poor guy without a dinner, but definitely unexpected!

First night jitters? Overall, TL;DR: we will be back! Good food, great atmosphere, they might just need a little time to settle into being open!"}
{"text":"Ambience was really nice.
Worst sushi I've ever had. Really. Don't order it. 
Cheese curds were great."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast as it was the only one not busy close by. My girlfriend had the biscuits and gravy and I had the French toast. The biscuits and gravy looked to be \"normal\", but they churched up the French toast too much for me. It was still ok, but with all of the different syrups, and jams on it, I would've preferred just normal French toast. 

I did order a side of bacon, and that was amazing!"}
{"text":"Can't understand why everyone was/is so thrilled with this place. Went for the first time, and most likely won't be back.
Good service, and was able to get in on a busy Friday night without a reservation. But the food has something to be desired. Overall the sushi rolls were good, and everything was good - but not great. I think if the prices were more in line with the quality and taste it would be better, but the prices are what you'd expect for excellent food, not OK. 

Also, neat space, but holy hell is it loud. Very hard to even carry on a conversation with 1 other person, can't imagine a big group."}
{"text":"Tavernakaya is what I would describe to be a great unique and upscale experience. There is a fusion of Thai, Japanese, and American food taking place here. They have some of the most unique drinks that I've ever seen done in Madison. I ordered the Red Curry Noodles, my date had the TK Ramen, we got an order of Tempura Cheese, and the OG Pork Buns. We had a great time with the server as well. He had a great honest and personable personality. My Red Curry Noodles were so delicious I didn't want it to end. The Red Curry Noodles was served with a whole fried chicken leg that balanced so well with the broth. Before we placed our order, our waiter did warn me that the Red Curry Noodles were extremely spicy. I love spicy food though so I went with it anyway. I would say, if you are a beginner to spicy food and don't have a high tolerance, do not get this dish. My date said that the TK Ramen was good but became greasy towards the end of his meal. We enjoyed the pork buns but thought they were just so so. We both loved the Tempura Cheese. The Tempura Cheese is served with their spicy mayo which I'm a big fan of. Aside from food, we also ordered their Japanese Old Fashion which is made just like an old fashion but instead of just whiskey, they use Iwa Japanese Whiskey. I would recommend the Japanese Old Fashion for those who like a great drink that is on the stronger side. The first time I ever went to Tavernakaya, I ordered a Thai Basil Mojito. I am a huge fan of the Thai Basil Mojito. Most places that have made traditional Mojito have either been too sweet or too strong but this one, it is very well balanced. I will be returning to try other things on the menu and enjoy fancy drinks that are not found anywhere else around this area. I highly recommend this place for people who are looking to get a unique experience with flavors of food and like to be adventurous with drinks."}
{"text":"Went for a drink stayed for the kickin' sushi! Favorite in town! The decor is great and the staff is really friendly.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"7 days in Madison, WI and TWO trips to Tavernakaya!!! We had a large party both days and we were able to sample most of the menu the first trip.  Starting with the Edamane, Miso soup and several of the specialty Sushi options (that were all amazing) to the delicious Chicken and Shrimp Yakitori.  A feast for your eyes as well as my stomach.   The O.G. pork buns were unlike anything I've eaten before - sweet, savory And the soft bun was just the perfect compliment to it.  This is not a maybe, but a must!  For our main meal the Tonkatsu (deep fried panko breaded pork tender loin) was simple and delicious!  The Ponzu steak frites stole the show for sure and I'll eat that again and again.  A true food lovers experience.  When we returned a few days later the General Tso's chicken and The General Tso's cauliflower were perfect.  Spicy Tuna was great.  The Nueske's bacon & egg fried rice is also a must for lunch or dinner.  Thank you to the amazing staff for great service and making this a unique experience for me and my family. (Don't forget Tavernakaya has a full bar- and the spiced Tokyo mule was my favorite drink!)"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Tavernakaya and I was intrigued by the menu.  The different cuisines mixed together were fun but also unfocused.  I can't decide how I feel about this.  

Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and very approachable.  The dining room was comfortable but really loud.  

We ordered the chicken meatballs, shoshito peppers, a dragon roll and the two-cup chicken.  The meatballs have a great seasoning/marinade but the fact they were chicken did not match it.  

The peppers were decent.  They could have used more charring.  The chicken was really good.  It was more sweet than spicy but it still had great flavors.  

I will give it another try but I won't go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"Awesome brunch. Cute waitress. American brunch dish highly recommended for some classic egg bacon toast. Awesome place too -- cool layout. Looks good for night outings also."}
{"text":"I always approach restaurants that are part of \"Restaurant Groups\", with some trepidation.  I feel like at times the experience and food tends to just be mediocre at best.  Enter Tavernakaya.

I've been here twice so far, and have been impressed both times.  The space is pretty cool, and the food is on point!  Both times my wife and I have gotten the three cup chicken.  It has a real unique blend of flavors.  The ginger with the basil is great.

We have also had the spicy miso ramen.  This was my first \"ramen\" experience, and it didn't disappoint.  It was spicy, but not too much.

The beef curry udon was good, especially the noodles.

Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food is good albeit expensive. I got the taiwainese popcorn chicken and it was meh. They have a menu of expensive items on skewer sticks. My friend and I got the mushroom one and it was really really good. I am a bigger fan of the drinks- Madison has lots of \"craft cocktails\" (*eye roll*) but the drinks here are unpretentious and delicious. I have been back (just for drinks) because of the convenient location and because I like the feel of the place- it feels like you are in a big city."}
{"text":"I'm sad to say I haven't enjoyed anything at TK outside of the sushi. Recently, I tried the Tofu buns and the Togarashi fries. Both were bland. I had high hopes for the fries, especially, since the menu described them as being sprinkled with a unique seasonings. There was seasoning, for sure, but I couldn't taste it! Nor could I taste the aioli. 

Luckily they 1) were fully stocked with the Malbec I always order from them - that never fails me! and 2) the sushi was impeccable, per usual. :)
 
They definitely have not lost my service - servers are always so kind and accommodating, and I have to try the General Tso's cauliflower - what a treat that must be!"}
{"text":"The Good: The food was delicious. Our group shared a couple of plates, including the Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken, Pork Gyoza, OG Pork Buns, Kakuni skewer, General Tso's Chicken, Nueske's Bacon & Egg fried rice and a few raw rolls. I would recommend each one. Every dish we sampled was flavorful and unique - as well as portioned as advertised. I also did not mind the dim lighting. It felt complimentary to the restaurant's cool vibe. 

The Not So Good: Collectively, the only feedback coming from our group would be to slow down between plates. We were in a great atmosphere with great company - rushing the plate delivery rushed the pace of the meal unnecessarily. 

The Highlight: The OG Pork Buns. Rich flavor and a tender bite. Honorable mention: Bacon & Egg Fried Rice!"}
{"text":"\"Monday-Thursday: 11am - 2pm & 4pm - 10pm\"

Showed up at 4:10 hoping for an early dinner before the rush only to be told that only the bar is open at 4. Maybe post that a little more clearly next time.

I've eaten here before and the ramen is good for Madison, and there is a good alcohol selection. The Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken is a travesty. I lived in Taiwan for a bit and lived on the chicken there. This stuff was dry and flavorless (did I mention it costs at least 8 times more than what I paid in Taipei?)

Service can be pretty slow too - the servers don't really seem attentive. We waited more than 15 minutes for our drinks after placing the order.

I want to like Tavernakaya for its convenience, but it's just not there."}
{"text":"If you can get over the fact that you're listing to EDM as you dine (which takes some getting used to haha), this is one of the best spots to enjoy Asian fusion, IMHO.

My favorite thing to get is the spicy ramen. Every time I get it, a noob in the group says, \"Don't you want sushi?!\" And I say, \"Yes, but I'll order it if I've still got room after the ramen.\" Then when the ramen comes, I share a bite with them and they inevitably regret not doing the same thing. Because the spicy ramen is king--and don't you forget it.

The Madison roll is my favorite--it's got kale and avocado and other goodies in it too. For sushi, I love the flying fish roe--I could eat it ALL DAY.

Make sure to order a drink too--they are SERIOUSLY good. I always try something different, and have never been disappointed. 

Bathrooms are clean. Don't expect to be seated right away if you didn't make a reservation. Stop complaining and make a reservation--food this good doesn't come without a wait."}
{"text":"We couldn't make up our mind between ramen and sushi so Tavernakaya was the natural middle ground! Their drinks are unique, and their sushi is delicious... definitely get the yellowfin nigiri. The pork buns were great and besides the ramen that was too salty everything was great!"}
{"text":"Checked out this place for the first time during restaurant week lunch and really enjoyed the various dishes including the seaweed salad, rainbow roll and cauliflower General Taos (for the veggie lovers out there it's a must). I saw three cup hockey on the menu and observed many people ordering and enjoying this dish as well. It's on my list of things to try when I head back."}
{"text":"I can't really say that I was wowed by Tavernakaya's traditional Asian food, but they make up for it with friendly, accommodating service, fun, hip atmosphere, ambitious fusion dishes, and tasty beverages. And, although I wasn't blown away by the Asian offerings, I found it to be decent enough and certainly enjoyable.

I was the first from my party to show up and everybody else was pretty late, but the friendly host still put our table together and sat me so that I could enjoy a delicious Hitachino Nest draft beer while I perused the menu and waited for my friends. The menu had a good mix of Japanese and Taiwanese food as well as some Japanese-inspired Wisconsin fare.

I got to try a hamachi roll, Taiwanese pork buns, tempura battered cheese curds, and spicy miso ramen.

The hamachi roll was definitely above average. The fish was not cold or chewy, and the rice was slightly warm and flavorful from the seasoning. I had it with the house sake which actually had some delightful notes of melon and lychee and was only $6.

The Taiwanese pork buns were nice and melty from the braise pork belly with a sweet and salty hoisin-based sauce. The bun was not dry either. This was better than the last time I had Taiwanese pork buns elsewhere, but I can't say they were mind-blowing.

The tempura battered cheese curds are actually incredible. The curds are on a skewer like yakitori chicken skewers before being tempura battered and fried until they're really gooey. The skewers are seasoned with togarashi before being placed on a plate with togarashi mayo with black sesame. These are definitely not your traditional fried cheese curds, but they could be your favorite in Madison if you give them a chance.

The ramen was pretty good, but not to my preference. I found the noodles to be a tad thin and the chashu pork belly to be too thin and relatively flavorless. The menma bamboo shoots kind of just tasted like soy sauce. The ajitsuke tamago marinated egg was on point though with its creamy yolk, soft whites, and tan color. The broth was spicy enough, fragrant and nutty with a strong roasted garlic flavor. Objectively, I have to say the broth was amazing, and most people would probably love it, but I just wasn't feeling it.

Although I probably won't be coming back to have their Asian dishes, I would love to come back for a little sushi or some snacks and drinks. I had a really fun experience, and I would recommend that you give it a try if you've been thinking about going here."}
{"text":"Ordered spicy miso ramen, spicy tuna rolls and spicy salmon rolls. Pathetic ramen to begin with, it tastes like egg noodle bought from the freezer section of Asian grocery store. I don't remember if they get their noodles from umami, but that one does not have good ramen anyway. Nothing about the dishes is spicy at all. Server was unfriendly, and literally just dumped the dish at us. Quite a shame to have this place in the center of a beautiful city."}
{"text":"I entered deeply skeptical of the idea - Asian fusion restaurants rarely do things well, as they emphasize style over substance and tend to be gimmicky. But now having actually tried it, I thoroughly withdraw my criticism. I have tried all the ramen place that I'm aware of (here, Umami, and the newly opened Ramen Kid), and of the three, I place this in highest esteem by a hair's length.

For lunch, I had a bowl of their pork ramen with a miso soup base. I also had a chef's choice of sashimi (7 pieces) and a cup of jasmine tea. The space itself is very pleasant. Large space, high ceiling, with the clean modernist aesthetic of other places on the Square like Graze. Now, the first crucial test - is the ramen broth savory? Yes! It's miso-based, not pork broth-based, so it's not so meaty as the tonkotsu that you might get at Ramen Kid and is instead more generally savory the way miso soup is. The pork slices were tender, and the ramen noodles were properly cooked (not soggy, but with texture and firmness). The sashimi was also really good. Maybe it's because I haven't had seafood for ages, but the sashimi tasted fantastic that day. If the fish had been frozen for some extent before, it isn't apparent from the quality of the fish.

Five stars here doesn't quite mean my usual five stars. Usually five stars for me means \"good god this meal was divine\". No, I won't go so far as to order from here as my last meal, five stars merely that it is better than the other ramen places. And not by a huge margin - the ramen itself is on par with Ramen Kid, and it squeaks by because the ambiance and other accoutrements (especially their drink menu) of Tavernakaya makes it better. It's also not the cheapest, so let that be a part of your calculations if you decide to come here. But as a whole, I must disagree with the majority and give Tavernakaya more credit than what my second-hand impressions of the place first had me believe."}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of a kind in Madison- probably in all of Wisconsin.  It's modeled after street food places in Japan so there are meats on skewers and small bites.  But there is also sushi and noodle dishes.  

First thing, the vibe and decor is very hip but not overally trendy.  Food is most important but its nice to eat in a beautifully appointed place sometimes. We were greeted right away by friendly hosts and seated at one of their few booths.  They also have plenty of large open tables for bigger parties.  

The menu was very manageable but diverse.  I ordered beef curry udon.  It was not what I expected- I thought it would be soupy but the curry was thick sauce on top of noodles.  I loved it!  Actually surprised with something for once.  The curry was very subtle but all the flavors were there.  The noodles were perfectly chewy.  It was a very hearty dish with the beef, noodles and curry/potatos so it was nice to have it be less soupy.  

I also ordered a non-fish sushi roll with fried kale.  It was really yummy but a bit on the tiny side.  

We also tried their fries which were sprinkled with a Japanese sesame seasoning.  Fries stayed crispy and came with aioli dip.  

Overall, this place has so much potential to bring new flavors and food to the Madison scene.  I thought the prices were very reasonable- came out to about $40/for two of us including one beer.  It is located on the square next to Walgreens so super easy to find and great for date night or night out with friends.  It is a buzzing, fun, kind of atmosphere or you can ask for one of their back booths for more intimacy."}
{"text":"Overall, I've had really positive experiences every time I've been here. I've tried a bunch of different things including their ramen, different skewers, udon noodles, rolls, and fried rice. All is very solid and tasty! Was I overly impressed with anything? No. But the food is consistently good and the service was great from my perspective.

The bar menu was on point for what I would expect, but the thing that really sells this place is the ambiance. I love the decor and the layout is very modern. The have a combo of booths, tables and high tables and from almost anywhere you can see right into the kitchen, which I always think is cool.

It's a great place to go with 2-4 people so then you can share a bunch of small plates and try a lot of different things."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and very different atmosphere for most restaurants in Madison. 

The sushi is really good, but Red Sushi, also in Madison, definitely tastes a little bit fresher. But the Mochi here is absolutely amazing, the coffee flavor was definitely my favorite."}
{"text":"Food: 3
Service: 3
Uniqueness: 4

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Tavernakaya has some unique offerings and a great location but it's quite expensive. Also, while some have given Tavernakaya a thumbs up on the service, our experience wasn't necessarily anything to write home about. The servers were friendly but not necessarily very attentive. We were hoping for a quick meal before a show and it ended up lasting over an hour during the peak dinner rush.

The ramen was disappointing and not very flavorful and the yakitori (we had the hanger steak, pork belly, and mushrooms) were really underwhelming.

The maki rolls are something that rescues this menu! They have some really interesting rolls in the MC Hama and the TK Bay that were really delicious!"}
{"text":"One of the great things about living downtown is the abundance of restaurants but Tavernakaya is among the best.  There is only so much bar food you can take. Tavernakaya offers wonderful food, artfully presented in a great atmosphere with terrific service.  My wife does not like sashimi.  However when she saw how beautiful my plate was composed, it intrigued her enough to try it.  It was so delicious she now considers it an option when dining here.  We also had the O.G. Pork Buns as an appetizer.  Wonderful flavor.  The Miso soup offered a great balance.   For our main course I had the Taiwanese Three Cup Chicken and my wife had the General Tao's Cauliflower.  Both were exceptional.  The chicken is spicy, but not over the top hot and I really enjoyed the distinctive flavor.  

This is one place you have to try.   It is distinctive and a great dining experience."}
{"text":"It was a lively active scene when we dropped in earlier this week.  The restaurant is divided into a few sections-bar, sushi bar, and tables. The menu is pretty diverse-sushi, yakitori, noodles, salads, small and large plates.  We ordered a few items and were not overly impressed.  We started with edamame and two rolls-tuna/avocado and yellowtail.  They were both fine.  Hard to screw up edamame.  The rolls were not well crafted and a few fell apart on the plate.  We then moved on the pork gyoza, fried chicken buns, and the popcorn chicken.  Of the three, the gyoza fared the best.  The dumplings had a nice sear and the filling inside was flavorful.  The bun, on the fried chicken bun, lacked the sponginess and softness that a good bun has.  Flavorwise, it was just all right.  The popcorn chicken was downright inedible.  Upon her first bite, my girlfriend asked, \"What am I eating\".  Was it skin?  Was it meat?  Was it an old leather shoe?  Who knows but we did send it back and had it removed from our bill. Instead, we tried the three cup chicken.  I thought it was good although the ginger should have been more prominent.  At $14, I would question the value of the dish as well.
As a big fan of Umami, I would have thought the owners would have carried through the attention to detail and execution to this restaurant.  After my first visit, it doesn't appear to be the case."}
{"text":"Very disappointingly giving it 2.5 stars. Review up for restaurant week lunch. 

I have heard good things about this place and we did receive good service. In addition, the view of the Capitol is about as good as it gets from the restaurant. However, I was extremely disappointed by the food. 

Our first course set us up for what we thought would be a fantastic meal: the Kale salad and seaweed salad were good (seaweed standard but the kale salad was unique and excellent). Our second course was just alright. The pork bun was very disappointing (it was a very small piece of meat with two sparse slices of cucumber and green onions) and the tempura fried cheese curd was just alright (it came on a skewer and as one slightly longer curd). However, these courses were not the main problem.

We tried the miso ramen and the spicy miso ramen and both were extremely disappointing. The bowl came out not very filled and presentation wasn't great (which is fine, since it's all about flavor, but I was a bit apprehensive from first look). There was a large layer of oil covering both my bowl and my SO's bowl of ramen, which was concerning. What was really disappointing was the first bite. The broth was some of the saltiest I have ever had. My spicy miso ramen was slightly better than my SO's regular miso ramen, but it was extremely tough for us to finish. In addition, the pork slices were disappointing, as it was not the typical charshu slices. Everything ended up being too salty and oily and we could barely eat our entrees. We aren't ones to usually complain, but we ended up drinking a lot of water and taking the majority of our ramen home (we're hoping to dilute the salt and oil and maybe finish our lunch). We did enjoy the poached egg and the bamboo slices though. 

I really hope that this is just a restaurant week change in the ramen, but I was, unfortunately, extremely disappointed. In addition, I can't justify the regular prices for the ramen that we had."}
{"text":"Sorry to report this review at a negative and I am not trying to be, so I do apologize  
I'm from Osaka and one thing I have to say is that I'd happen to like the tradition when it comes to Japanese food and as someone that is a  specialist in making Okonomiyaki and I'm a guy that loves to make Okonomiyaki to make for friends and love ones. I am not a meat eater but I am good at making. Okonomiyaki was missing some ingredients and felt short. I wasn't happy to be serve  an dish that I paid for my dear friend Kei that came a long way from Japan to not have a good experience. She even agree that it wasn't as good as my Okonomiyaki. These Fusion restaurant can cause some confusion when understanding the ART of Japanese food and what I'd mean by that is, The right way and education ways to understand the real taste of Japanese food before making fusion meals. This place, I will most I will return to give it another spot since the restaurant was fairly new to the City of Madison. But servers were not very professional and seem to be lost at time. I'm a Photographer that travels quite a bit all the time and does eat tons of difference cultural meals and this place Tavernakaya is just like some other fusion place and I will quote this \"Nice try, but not good enough\" Make it was the cook I can't really tell you but it was ok experience for the both of us. Now drinks were excellent and place was clean overall but i really wish my waiter pay a little more attention to us because when we did needed a refill on drinks, it took about 5-10 minutes. Now plating was excellent to when food was being serve to others that were there are the experience and I like the colors on the dishes and great vision for the sushi bar."}
{"text":"The food here just kept getting better and better. Ordered 5-6 different dishes with a party of 4 and we all shared. So much deliciousness. Highly recommend the general tso's chicken with spicy udon with xo sauce. Sashimi was also impressive for Midwest sushi."}
{"text":"It's truly rare that there is no redeeming part of a meal that made it enjoyable. Usually either the service is good, the food is good, and/or the price is good. 

Admittedly we went at a very busy time. The server was quick to greet us and take drink orders. However the spiel about how the restaurant serves in the \"eastern\" style and if the table can't handle they can serve is in the \"western\" style was annoying at best and wildly inappropriate at worst. We got our drinks quickly for the most part, but the tea one of us ordered came a good 2 or 3 minutes later. I had just assumed they were steeping the tea and bringing it out when it was ready. I was disappointed to see that they put a tea bag in a tea cup it instructions to let it steep for 4 minutes with no indication about how long it's been steeping. I had a Diet Coke, which came out quickly initially, but when I asked for a refill, as told that the bar is backed up and it will take a while. I'd understand if I order even a simple mixed drink, but soda is something you pour while you're pouring something else also. 

The food was alright. It wasn't bad for the most part, but extremely salty at times and really under seasoned at others. We ordered popcorn chicken after it was recommended by friends. The flavor was good but it was insanely salty, speaking as a person who likes salty food. General Tso's chicken tasted okay, but definitely not worth the price nor was it a large plate. You could get better GT chicken at literally any crappy Chinese restaurant. We also ordered pork buns which had a nice flavor, but the pork was bone dry. We also ordered the TK inferno set which was 3 different types of rolls and very reasonably priced. One of them was a scallop roll, which was filled with flying fish roe. So you only tasted and felt that. The scallop could have been boiled potato and I would not have known, the amount of flying fish roe that was in there. The coup de gras was the tofu skewer. For 7 bucks we got 4 small pieces of tofu that I couldn't figure out whether it was grilled or just gray, topped with a ginger miso like sauce and tasted okay. 7 bucks. For gray tofu with some sauce. Not okay.

Overall the entire meal came to about 18 bucks per person for our 5 person party. Only because we didn't want to spend more money to be disappointed. We just went to tornado room and got steak sandwiches.

Hard pass."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but it was a really nice experience. Went with two couples and we shared a bunch of dishes.  Anything from sushi, to noodles, to spare ribs.  We tried a ton and had a really nice bottle of sake.  Everything was great including the service.  I'd happily eat here again."}
{"text":"At the writing of this review, Tavernakaya, overall, has 3.5 stars. I would say that is entirely accurate.

I've made 2 visits so far, both of which have been very enjoyable. But, I would say that on both occasions, there was something that was a bit off the mark. Something under seasoned, not well balanced or just not amazing.

I will definitely be back. There are still more fun things to try, I'm a huge fan of sushi and ramen, so there is more than enough to keep me entertained."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight. Had pork buns, MC Hama roll, chicken wings and miso ramen. The pork buns were the one winner. The chicken wings were small, not very Korean and you could easily find them at Buffalo Wild Wings or any area bar. The MC Hama roll was supposed to feature jalape√±o. We found none although the fish was fresh and supple. Finally the miso ramen was strangely sour. The noodles weren't fully cooked and the pork slices were dry. For ramen, go to Umami. This just doesn't cut it. 

However we did have good service from our waitress Hannah. She gets two thumbs up."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice and would give it a solid 3.5. I do like some of their dishes on their menu especially their Ramen and buns but other such as sushi I am bias as I have other locations I prefer, but this entirely up to every ones tastes buds.
I really like their buns either pork or chicken and usually start with them as appetizers, followed by Ramen noodles. My favorites are the Red Coconut Curry noddle - I really like their sauce mix or their spicy ramen

Their staff is friendly and knowledgeable and I like their minimalistic decor. Bathrooms are clean.
I suggest making a reservation as sometimes the waiting time can be a bit long.

I really like their location at the capitol, a great place to start your tour of Madison."}
{"text":"Came here for restaurant week on a weekday. We came at 11 am and by 1130, there was already a huge line set up. I can't really explain the popularity of this place as I thought the food here was pretty mediocre. Perhaps it is the proximity to the capitol (I saw a lot of businessmen/women coming in for lunch).

The kale gomae was actually very good. This was the first time I had had something like this and I was pleasantly surprised. The rest of the meal did not go so well. The ramen was way too salty. The noodles were good but the broth really did away with the experience. The pork was also not the right kind of pork. Really disappointing in general since I heard such good things about this place.

I will not be coming back, especially since Ramen Kid is around."}
{"text":"Man, where to begin? First of all, ideal atmosphere for a lot of different dining scenarios. Nice lighting, polished set pieces, and intriguing decor give the space a modern yet comfortable feel. 

The food was spectacular. The \"OG\" Pork Buns were on par with any you'll find in Madison. Fresh, soft mantou buns and a great cut of pork belly inside, bursting with flavor. Nice pickled vegetables inside add a nice contrast. The Taiwanese popcorn chicken was also excellent--a nice dry rub spice blend served with an excellent dipping sauce. Finally, the meat of the Samurai ribs fell off the bone and were the perfect amount of spice. 

Nice to see a spot like this open on the Square....casual enough that grabbing a quick bite is easily doable, but upscale enough that hosting a formal occasion here is also an excellent choice. I'd go back in a heartbeat, and will be frequently."}
{"text":"Executive summary: I would give this place 5 stars but it's SO HARD to get into!  This is right on the square so plan to park in a nearby ramp or on the street if you are blessed by the parking gods.  Restrooms are nicely appointed and clean.  Restaurant decor is enticing.  Vegetarian, vegan, and gluten sensitive items are marked on the menu...makes it easy!

Note: this restaurant is a battery draining cell dead zone!  Consider turning your phone to airplane mode.

The food is delicious!  They have vegetarian and even vegan options along with gluten sensitive selections.  I occasionally eat fish so there's no problem finding a gluten free seafood dish here for me.  Nomnomnom.

It can be super busy here.  You're best to snag a reservation if you can (can be done online via the website) but even getting a reservation can be a trick.  If you're patient, I feel it's worth the wait.  

Food is delivered as it is prepared so expect to get your items one or two at a time and apparently at random.  It makes it tricky when you're politely waiting until everyone has food in front of them to start eating.  I recommend going with friends who don't care about such things...if the sushi is in front of you, start eating...that's my motto!"}
{"text":"I went here with my sister a few weeks ago when she was visiting Madison, and it was so delicious! We wound up sharing the General Tso's chicken dish (which was a ton and amazing) and a few different rolls. Their seaweed salad is also amazing, please order it. Also, their drinks are amazing, even if you don't like Sake (which I don't)."}
{"text":"We really need 1/2 stars. I'm torn between rounding up or down, and opting to round down until my next visit. 

It's a pretty decent venue with a minimalist approach, and definitely a break from the usual square options. They've got an okay looking cocktail menu, but nothing that really cried out to me. Beer selections were decent, as were the wine options. I'd say the pricing was pretty fair, but the cocktails seemed a little steep for what they were. 

I didn't think it was too busy for a Thursday night, but I'm told weekends pack in pretty well. Given how pricey the local real estate runs, that's gotta be crucial to long-term. The staff was polite and genuinely seemed to be having fun. 

My skewered shiitake were okay, as were the edamame and pork gyoza. They were fine, just nothing that makes me say that they were outstanding. Presentation didn't really exist for these dishes compared to some of the more involved ones like the tuna tartare, so I wasn't taking pictures. 

For the menu itself, this is where I get lost. They do a lot of standard items, such as your edamame, gyoza and buns. Then there are the skewer options, noodles in broth, and a selection of sushi/rolls. I had higher expectations of what I'd find here and it sorta fell flat. 

I'm not sure I understand how this can be labeled a gastropub, but I suppose the inclusion of wings, a burger and a steak & frites dish are now qualifiers. I appreciate the concept of the General Tso's cauliflower, but I think the cauliflower thing has been done too often at a lot of other restaurants. Outside of a few items, everything else was standardized Asian fusion, and I've had equally good options with less fanfare and easier parking. 

It's a Food Fight location, so take that as you will. I'm just not feeling very excited about it. Between the two options from Ding, I'll stick with Umami."}
{"text":"5 star experience- great location on the square with outdoor seating overlooking the WI Capitol building! Excellent customer service - very attentive server! Very tasty fries with a wasabi, ginger aioli dipping sauce. They use high quality ingredients like Nueske's bacon in their bacon & egg fried rice which was delicious. The 4 people in our group had a couple of small plates and shared two large plates for just under $40 (just water for drinks). We were satisfied with the portions received. We will definitely return to try some of the other menu items and to order some more of those tasty fries."}
{"text":"*UPDATE*

On a recent return visit, I arrived famished.  While an introductory kale salad hit all the right notes in terms of the flavor profile (thanks to a nicely balanced sauce) the side dish was only steamed kale, without any additional elements.  The main event was their three cup chicken, which turned out to be a commitment as a single portion.  I was able to almost finish it due to my hunger state, but in retrospect there were disappointing aspects.  While the chicken itself was cooked to correct taste and texture, the lemongrass had been cooked past a point of visual recognition.  I would add that the sauce and ginger were well aspected in the flavor profile, but the dish needed less chicken and some kind of vegetable compliment to take focus away from the monochromatic impact.  Maybe the manager/owner could crunch a few numbers to justify a change in the dish.  In the end (including a beer), I paid $30 with tip.  That's a little steep to let these kinds of details slide."}
{"text":"Wife and I dined here for lunch.  I wanted the yakatori chicken but was surprised to discover they only served it for dinner.  Bummer.  Wife ordered 2 rolls (eel and crab) and I ordered the fried rice with bacon.  Wife said she liked Muramoto better bc her rolls fell apart.  My fried rice was meh.  Not sweet and has a strong charred taste. Our favorite fried rice is still Saigon Noodles Combination Fried Rice.  If I come back, it'll be to try the yakatori chicken."}
{"text":"We had a great experience during our first visit. Warm, inviting, and interesting decor. Really friendly, attentive, and prompt service (thank you Boris!), and our food was delicious. We tried the miso soup, the veggie buns, the peppered fries, the MadTown roll, and the General Tso's cauliflower and enjoyed making our way through the different areas of the menu, sharing dishes. The MadTown roll was the standout.

Our second visit was a different experience - neither the food nor the service shined as they did the first time, even though we ordered a couple of the same things. 

Ordering tips: the MadTown role is amazing, and the skewers are (really) tiny."}
{"text":"AWESOME FOOD!  Food here is as progressive as it gets. I ordered a completely veg meal with friends and it was totally worth it. I recommend the cheese curds, general tso cauliflower, seaweed salad, and udon noodle salad. Check this place out!"}
{"text":"After coming here twice, I think this is definitely a solid 4-star restaurant. It's not amazing but it's UNIQUE and the ambience and decor is great! Service was relatively fast both times, which is surprising from an Americanized Japanese restaurant. Some food impressed me, some didn't, but definitely an enjoyable experience overall.

They say that they're Japanese-style tapas, but I found that it's really easier to just order your own stuff. I would call them a Japanese fusion restaurant, with some unique Japanese twists on classic American food.

The sushi rolls are 6 small pieces per roll, which actually makes them a surprisingly cheap option - you can get two rolls for ~$15 and they're not bad at all! Not as good as Red, but I think Tavernakaya's other food/prices make up for their sushi quality.

The tempura cheese curds were to die for! Their fries were also pretty great. I personally enjoyed the Alaskan roll a lot, but the Hotate roll fell a little short. Maybe scallop just isn't for me...

Anyways, I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for a nice Japanese restaurant that's unique and not too traditional! Pro tip: make reservations on weekends!"}
{"text":"I am really enjoying this newish addition downtown. Have been there 3 times this year and each time was great. Try the popcorn chicken, TKO roll, and the spicy ramen."}
{"text":"Underwhelming, loud, innane slow service.  I really don't know why it's so popular."}
{"text":"Came here with a pretty large group of about 10-12 people. Our waitress was friendly, accommodating, and even had recommendations and conversations with us. As a person who 10 times out of 10 will order a dish with meat in it, I really wanted to venture out of my comfort zone, so I tried the General Tso Cauliflower. 11/10, would eat again. In fact, they have regular General Tso Chicken on the menu and when I go back, I'll still order the Cauliflower. It's that good. It's very lightly fried in a tempura batter, you wouldn't even know it's cauliflower by the time it hits your tastebuds. So delicious! We also tried the popcorn chicken and the cheese curds as an appetizer. Both were very well done, though the popcorn chicken spice wasn't my favorite. It had a cinnamon-y taste to it (they use a special dry rub). The flavors were there, I just wasn't expecting cinnamon is all, so that was a miss for me, but only based on personal tastes. Cheese curds were great, a unique spin on them being on a skewer and served with a spicy mayo drizzle. Finally, we also ordered a few veggie-based rolls of sushi. Delicious, fresh, and lots of filling, very impressed. We'll definitely be back as the service, price, and quality all matched our expectations and then some!"}
{"text":"Wasn't very good. We tried the entire spread. It's a good atmosphere. The server was nice. The food just wasn't a good Quality. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This is a tough one. I really wanted to give them a better rating. 

I ordered the shrimp tempura udon noodle bowl. Noodles were very chewy. I sent it back and ordered the 3 cup Taiwanese Chicken instead. The chicken coating was gummy and the dark meat inside was very fatty. It arrived lukewarm as the replacement for my previous dish. 

My daughter loved the chef's choice sushi she ordered. It came with a California roll. The hub had veggie fried rice. He liked it because it was moist and not greasy. They shared Korean fried chicken wings, which they said were very, very good.

On a previous visit I did try the veggie bun with crispy tofu, and that is by far my favorite right now. 

The atmosphere is mostly ahead of the food that I have tried so far. I'd probably come back to the veggie bun, but that's about it."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of trying Tavernakaya on Valentine's Day! It's a small space and somewhat felt like we were on a double date with the couple next to us. The food is delicious! I ordered from the Food Fight Foodie Week menu: Tempura Cheese Curds (appetizer), 3 Cup Chicken (entree), and chocolate cake (dessert). My husband had the Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken to start and a burger for his entree. We plan on returning for happy hour!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat sushi.
They have an alternate menu for gluten free, vegetarian and vegan options.
The vegan avocado & veggie roll were delicious. 
The vegan General Tso's cauliflower was SO good!
My husband had the TKO roll and said it was one of the best rolls he has ever had in his lifetime. 
The ambience is loud. It can fill up quickly on a weekend night.
Great place for a date night or for a group."}
{"text":"Drinks are really good could use less ice though. Went during Restaurant week and the food was very meh. The Tofu Bun starter was crap. It tasted like microwaved tofu with nuts. Ramen noodles were very bland, spicy miso broth was good though. Sushi is pretty good. Chocolate cake redeemed the meal. I don't really understand the hype for this place considering the price and all the great restaurants in the area. I guess Madison is pretty starved of Asian cuisine. Also, they are overt about who their target audience is (cough millennials cough)."}
{"text":"Decent, at best. As others have noted, the interior is beyond beautiful. So many interesting details to catch the eye but overall tastefully minimal. There were many well-dressed hip looking yuppie types around - great people watching and divine eavesdropping. 

Cocktails were pretty good. Waiter said dishes would come out as they were ready, and they were well paced with beautiful presentation..if only they had been as delicious as they looked!

Food was largely bland. Sushi was best dish we had all night, but nowhere near as good as Muramoto. Gyoza were beautiful, but nothing to write home about. We also ordered the 'savory Japenese pancake' which was rather boring, despite 'dancing fish flakes'- or something...one of the toppings was very flaky, and when heated it moved, kind of like a sea anemone. Cute but tasted like tissue paper. Ramen was a big disappointment. I suspected it would be similar to Umami, which it was, but more bland. 

Bottom line: interior and dish presentation raises expectations, food does not deliver. Probably won't be back for a while."}
{"text":"EDIT: My boyfriend and I returned this past weekend. Service was great, and the food was good. We got the Terayaki Chicken and the Egg/Bacon Fried Rice and the steamed bun appetizer. We had leftovers to take home as well so portions were good!

My boyfriend and I popped in here for an early lunch when every breakfast/brunch place we went to had an hour wait. There was no line, but a good amount of people in there. We got beef udon noodles and the hangover hash.

The beef udon noodles portion seemed small for the price, and they seemed a little too oily. But, overall, it wasn't a bad dish with the shaved asparagus and green beans and mushrooms. I probably wouldn't order it again though.

The pork belly hangover hash was good, but again, half of the plate was a salad that had a sour dressing on it and big chunks of greens that seemed like they were just thrown on the plate. I will say that mixed with the potato hash, it wasn't a bad bite, but there was a lot of salad left on the plate. There didn't seem like a lot of pork belly either.

We also ordered orange juice, and it tasted watered down and just off.

It wasn't a great experience, but there were some other items on the menu that we'd be willing to give a chance especially after spying some tasty looking dishes on other tables. The service was efficient and good. Not spectacular, but nothing major to complain about."}
{"text":"Meh is the way I can describe this visit.
We had a reservation for 5:30p on a Friday but the place was pretty empty (and it was during their happy hour).
The happy hour deals for food weren't that impressive, but we ordered the fries and some drinks. I did get the wrong drink at first, but our waiter swapped it quick after I let him know. The fries were okay, we didn't end up finishing them. 
For dinner, we ordered:
*Sauteed Veggie Udon: when you think udon, you think broth but this more like stir fry with noodles. It tasted pretty good but was fairly plain. It would have been nice it tofu or something was added to make it feel more like a meal.
*Salmon Poke: our waiter let us know not to expect a full poke bowl, it would be more classic. Just poke and chips. It tasted similar what we had in Hawaii - fresh and flavorful. It wasn't drenched in sesame oil which was nice for my taste.
*We got two rolls and added things to them. It was weird you're given a basic roll and then have the options to add onto them. Not used to that, but it wasn't bad. You're able to add things like jalape√±os, avocados, tempura flakes, etc for additional $.

When I got the bill, I was pretty disappointed. So much money was spent for a meal that left us unimpressed and still kind of hungry. The happy hour deals didn't really help either. I feel like Tavernakaya has the potential to be really good but just falls flat right now."}
{"text":"I really like this place! It offers one of a kind menu and dining in Madison. Great drinks, cool location and vibe. But most of all the menu and food are AMAZING. I love sushi and Japanese food and this place adds a nice twist on those concepts. I wouldn't necessarily come here just for Sushi, there's better options in Madison. However if you come and order a few different items to share you'll likely find a new favorite."}
{"text":"Great concept: Japanese tapas restaurant. Its open till 2 - Madison needs more places like this. The ramen is from Umami. I'm not a fan of umami but it just fine ramen. The cocktails are average to good (I recommend the Tokyo Mule). The popcorn chicken is dry spiced based is grew on me the more I ate it. Overall the food is good, the atmosphere great, and is open I this place is a 4/5."}
{"text":"Small plates and drinks after work. Happy hour drink specials includes a merlot--was ok at $5  had the popcorn chicken and Japanese pancake with pork. Probably wouldn't order food here again. Music was innocuous but place is noisy. Probably not a good date or interview place. Service was nice. Bartender friendly but not intrusive."}
{"text":"The steak and fries were excellent, and we especially enjoyed the fries.  One problem is that the steak was sliced for us, but not well enough that we could easily grab slices with our chopsticks. Pork belly skewer was not remarkable--couldn't tell it was pork belly. I would order the crispy chicken wings again. I only sampled a bit of the miso ramen, which I would try again. Our table's favorite item was surprisingly the fried rice. The rice simply had good wok flavor which can be rare and the bacon helped too.

One of the mixed drinks with herbs served in a martini glass was remarkably good, but now I can't remember the name!

There were disruptions with the service.  Runners took a drink and an small plate before they were finished (there was a little left, but they still should have asked).

Next time I will probably order an entree rather than a lot of small plates, as I missed out on some of the entrees."}
{"text":"Came here for a work trip and the cheese curds sauce was pure deliciousness! I ended up with some miso soup and a variety of sushi. I came with a big group and they had enough seats for all of us. Great for family style. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"After a few letdowns at other high-hope places, Tavernakaya really came through for me!

VEGAN SUSHI:
I was over zealous and placed two sushi orders. TEMPURA KALE & AVOCADO ROLL. Each roll consists of 8 pieces, so it was really too much food for one person. Perfect for sharing and/or for left overs. The rolls were fresh and yummy.

TOGARASHI FRIES:
I ordered a vegan version, which just omits the aioli dipping sauce that comes with the regular version. Fries were crisp and well seasoned.  Very good!

VEGGIE FRIED RICE:
Ordered vegan and sans mushrooms or bean sprouts. The rice is cooked with onions, scallions, and broccoli. A delicious dish made from simple ingredients. Excellent!

GENERAL TSO CAULIFLOWER:
Yes, yes, yaaassss! Crispy cauliflower? Check! A perfectly sweet & spicy sauce? Check! This dish is truly amazing, especially coming from a restaurant that does not specialize in vegan cuisine. We were so impressed with this dish that we returned THREE times for it. Excellent!

Not only do they serve some wickedly good vegan food, but the service was top notch too. Of the 3 visits, we only received bad service once. I won't point out the bad waitress; she doesn't deserve the attention. I will, however, mention the excellent service provided by Erin and Lili Luxe. Amazing ladies! Very attentive and friendly. 

The restaurant is large and clean, even in the ladies room!  I also want to give a special shout out for their music selection. There was great music playing each night that we were there. I couldn't stop shaking my grove thang in my seat! 

The only thing I didn't enjoy here was the Organic Ginger Peach White Tea, (It just wasn't sweet enough for me.) and the parking situation. The restaurant is located in downtown Madison, so finding parking was challenging every time and required circling around a few times. Aside from that, I loved everything else about Tavernakaya; even the name is fun to say! Without a doubt, I'll return to Tavernakaya on my next trip to Madison."}
{"text":"Underwhelming food, bad service, yuppie atmosphere. I'm sure it works for some people, as it's always packed, but it's just not for me. I'd rather save my money for a dinner at Muramoto... or just go for the more low key atmosphere of Wasabi."}
{"text":"Great food, relaxed atmosphere.  Friendly staff.  One of my favorite places to stop for lunch.  I was going to stop in today, but just as I was about to step in the door I heard the unmistakable loud voice of Hank.  He was making weird comments about the fresh fish.  Instead of going in I peeped through a window and watched him for an hour.  He's a fascinating animal."}
{"text":"Tavernakaya has grown on me quite a bit since my first visit, which was closer to 2-3 stars. They have a variety of really tasty Japanese food and the new space/atmosphere is versatile for many different occasions. 

It can get crowded during the weekend rush, but recently, it's been easier to get a table. Their bartenders are awesome and they have great happy hour specials (4-6pm M-F, $3 Sapporo and Spotted Cow!). Also, they have a prosecco on the drink menu that is comparable to other wines. I normally don't order sparkling wine out, but if it's the same price, why not!

I think my favorite menu items to get are the sushi rolls. On my most recent visit, our table got the Madtown roll and the TKO roll; both quite good. I also got the miso soup to start, and it was a bit higher quality than what I'm used to. On a previous visit, I had gotten the General Tso's Cauliflower, and that's also one of my favs. The tuna tartare was small for the price and just ok. The fried rice dishes are pretty standard They have recently expanded the menu a bit so that the sushi items are on the back. That's a nice touch, because it was a bit confusing before and the options were limited. 

TK also hosts DJs on most weekend nights, which gives the place a totally different vibe. Make sure to check their event page before going to see if there's a cover! Sometimes there is. 

Our service was a bit shaky this last time and seems to be a theme. Nothing that ruined the meal, just a number of people bringing food to the table while our waitress was MIA for most of it. We asked for water 3 separate times until someone finally brought a pitcher over.

I can't wait to try brunch and see what other DJs are playing in the next few months."}
{"text":"Went last Friday night. Busy, hostess stressed. We did get seated without a reservation for 2.  
The food was ok. Server did well considering how busy she was. 
We weren't impressed enough to return."}
{"text":"Came during Restaurant Week, and every course was delicious! Lovely atmosphere and attentive service. We ate pork dumplings (crispy & savory), the General Tso Cauliflower--so crispy and best GT sauce I've ever had, Dragon sushi roll (yum!), and chocolate cake (fudgy & delish). The dirty gin martini was like butter. Yum! We'll be returning!"}
{"text":"Have been here in the past and it was ok, but it seems they have really gotten their act together...Delicious Tokyo Mule cocktail, great ribs, awesome 3 Cup Chicken, and really good sushi.  Great service. A new favorite in Madison!"}
{"text":"This place is not worth your money, I ordered miso ramen and my pork looked uncooked. I told the waiter that I did not like it and asked for something else, I had their sushi instead and it was okay. I was happy that they did not charge me for the miso ramen because it was nasty."}
{"text":"Great! We split the seaweed salad, tk bay roll, veggie buns and general tso's cauliflower. We couldn't decide which we loved the most, the sushi roll or the cauliflower."}
{"text":"Well, well, well. I had quite the night at Tavernakaya. While let me just say, make sure to bring a nice fresh copy of Madison magazine because you will have to wait for your food. Maybe bring your old high school yearbook to pass the time as well, it was lengthy. However, I digress, once the food arrived boy was it tasty. I was transported to the depths of Soho New York with my lovely dragon roll. This food tastes like gentrification, it's that good. Our server, Dan, was a lovely millennial (one of the few good ones), who served us quite politely. Then, out of nowhere, chaos. We were served the wrong order and Dan helplessly pleaded for mercy. We obliged and were given the General Tso's chicken for free. All in all it was a very lengthy yet wonderful night. If you have a ton of time, I would strongly recommend dining at this establishment."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try Tavernakaya for awhile and was finally able to go TWICE in the last week. The service was excellent, the setting was intimate and best of all the food was delicious. 

My first visit was JUST after 10pm, when they started their late night menu. As a vegan I was disappointed that there weren't options for vegans but the server snagged me the last bit of Miso soup which was incredibly thoughtful and kind of her. Drinks were good (Japanese Highballs.. try it, you'll like it) and the little amount of food I had was just fine.

Our second visit was the whole deal. I had a vegan sushi roll (avocado) for an appetizer while my husband enjoyed the pork buns. We were both impressed! Next I had Veggie Udon.. it was SO. GOOD. My only regret was giving my leftovers to a homeless gentleman (I don't regret it THAT much but I'm missing those noodles today :P). My husband had a salmon and then a snapper sushi roll, which he loved as well. Our server was sweet, attentive and patient with us as we were slow to order and ordered everything completely separate (after a few drinks the traditional timeline went out the window). 

We intend to return and hopefully next time to enjoy the food/drinks plus the DJ's they have coming through every weekend."}
{"text":"Wowzer!! What a great find!! This area is amazing with the amount of great food places.

Tavernakaya is a hip sushi restaurant that is just more than your typical sushi stop.

Mara is a great server and the food was excellent!!

Another great find on the square!!"}
{"text":"This might have been my favorite meal in Madison. Yes, Yes, it was. Service was attentive and friendly, and the place is clean and modern. We loved sitting near the front window and looking out at the gorgeous capitol building. We shared a couple of really good dishes - the tofu taco was a big hit, and so was the three-cup chicken. Great flavoring and cooked so tenderly. A few bits of sushi that had tempura pineapple - oh my land - tempura pineapple!! I can only imagine the chef was sitting around one night and thought... \"let's through pineapple in.\" And it works. Hit them up."}
