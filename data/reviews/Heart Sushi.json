{"text":"We came here for lunch on a Friday. Upon first impression, we noted the large space, high ceilings and modern decor. The service was hit-or-miss. Some of the servers were friendly, and attentive, while others just tossed our food on the table and walked away, ignoring all inquiries. 

As for the food, I was very impressed by the soup. We had hot and sour soup, and ordered a second one, it was that good. Other than that, there is nothing special about the food. The salmon sushi didn't taste very fresh, but I did enjoy the seaweed on the handrolls."}
{"text":"The sushi here is pretty bomb. Actually, if I were to just rate the food they deserve 4 stars. But the service is terrible, it seems like a HUGE favor for the waiters to do their job and they slam your orders on your table when they arrive. They barely smile or acknowledge you. I asked my waiter what dessert he would recommend and he said \"just pick one\" and stared at me. Anyway, I come here all the time because it is one of the better tasting sushi and they also have a wide selection! 

At this point I just always expect horrible service so I'm not shocked anymore. So if you're coming here for the first time just don't expect the best service but pretty good food!"}
{"text":"Given the pricepoint at $37 per person, including tax, my partner and I were greatly disappointed by the quality of the food. Big selection from the menu, but many menu items fall flat. I walked over to the sushi bar and was disgusted by how the salmon tataki was prepared. It was basically chunks of left over raw salmon crushed into a martini glass. Absolutely no flavor when it arrived at the table. Sushi rice was bland. Torched and pressed sushi were epic fails. Torched shrimp sushi was masked with a thick layer of Dijon mustard. Service was mediocre, some ordering mistakes were made even though it uses an iPad system to track orders. Will not come back again and not recommending it to anyone."}
{"text":"Went for lunch and really enjoyed the all-you-can-eat menu. Simple choices but all tasty and brought out quickly. Plus the serving sizes for curries/noodles are relatively small so you don't feel scared to try multiple items.

Red dynamite rolls are fabulous along with the Kalbi beef ribs and salmon roses.

Definitely feels a little rushed in there near the end of the meal but when we mentioned it the waitress immediately smiled and apologized!! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First impression of this place is that the atmosphere is very friendly and calm.  the food was good... they make excellent dumplings and won ton but the sushi lacks flavour. the crab meat is not fresh but the tempura is great. service is quick and we loved the authentic chopsticks and platters. the use of the ipad was a nice touch but it would be nice if it was secured on the wall and not taking space on the table.  

Also..  No Mint provided at checkout. 

overall, this place is great . 8/10 would come again"}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere. I liked being able to order from the iPad.  Food was served quickly once order was placed. 
Lots of variety to choose from.  
Found it to be very clean.  Very glad to have tried this place for the first time today.  
Will definitely of back."}
{"text":"I wasn't planning on posting a review for my visit to Heart Sushi cause I just wanted to chill out and not take pictures of every plate or pay close attention to everything. However, I'm posting entirely for the poor service we received from one particular waitress who waited on us during our entire visit. Extremely pushy and trying to get us to leave even though we were at least 45 minutes before closing time to prepare for dinner. Her attitude toward us was noticeable and unnecessary. When she brought our items out, she would place them on the table in front of her and slide them towards us. When it came time for dessert, we almost got thrown off of ordering anything because as we gave her our ice cream order, she would repeat them back in a rude tone and one of my friends asked for three scoops of mango ice cream and she said in a loud voice, \"THREE?!?\"  Finally, when she brought out our desserts she said something along the lines of, \"that's everything you ordered, you don't have anything else on the iPad to order so you're all done.\"....lol I mean it was just rude. Sad to say I left very annoyed but what can ya do. Otherwise the food was fine, sushi quality was better than some but not as good as others so it was mediocre."}
{"text":"Disgusting. My food came in a dirty bowl!! Looked as thought it was passed on from about 3 pervious customers that didn't want it!! I was so disgusted and it was just so unappetizing. It's like they don't care about the food that they sent out . Our waitress didn't bother cleaning our table until it was too full for her to place other food. Will never return to this place
Quality of food is not good , probably a few days old and the place seems dirty and staff does not care"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. Served cold chicken teryiaki and cold soup. Made it seem like it was our fault when we asked for another. Asked for tofu pieces with teriyaki with a 1 year old..and after 3 orders..said they were all out..what kind of sushi ayce runs out of tofu at 12pm. Banging dishes when dropping food. Not fulfilling orders from the ipad. Rude waitresses. Will never return. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi place in Mississauga by far.
I find at most restaurants especially all you can eat places the sushi isn't that great,
but Heart sushi has fresh tasting ingredients.
I have been there 5 times already and counting,
so I've tried almost everything on the menu and its absolutely delicious and mouth watering.
My favorite are all the hand rolls..
they also have sashimi on a chip which is very unique and tasty!
the lunch menu is smaller then the dinner menu but I usually go for dinner
$14.99 weekdays lunch and $24.99 dinner
at those prices for fresh all you can eat food you cant go wrong!

The alcoholic drinks look good on the menu but I would not recommend going for drinks there, I'm a bartender but when I watched them make the drink, they looked inexperienced and their free pouring seemed inconsistent.

Otherwise the food and fast service is awesome!
the Ipad ordering system is easy to use and very cool for the experience..
Although they sometimes are really busy on weekends and Thursday/Friday night dinner!!! so please call and make a RESERVATION and when you get there you'll see a mob of people WITHOUT reservations that will stare at you as you just walk in past them ;) oh well ... they should have called! haha"}
{"text":"The coolest thing about the store is probably the fact that you get to use an ipad to order, it was very easy and convenient. Also, I loved the interior. It was sooo big and very fancy!! The sushi itself was okay, was not the best but not the worst. The service wasn't amazing though.. I was confused about something and couldnt even get a single person to answer. One of the waitress just ignored me when she was serving me water and walked away right after I finished my question! And when I was paying and asked for my change back.. they never came back either!!!! I paid $20 for that.. not that expensive but I can pay that much somewhere else better :| Oh, and they do not accept debit so be aware!"}
{"text":"This place used to be good. Even better than the other location. Now it is utterly disappointing.
When we were seated, our table was dirty, our plates were dirty and had stains, we had to ask for new plates. Some of the food we ordered never came. Our tea/water was not refilled. Food we ordered in the beginning came while we were having dessert. Also it is very hard get anyone's attention to get any service. Will never go here again."}
{"text":"Wow best sushi in mississauga.  The decor is modern.   The service is fast and polite.  The food is the star of the place."}
{"text":"No soap in the bathroom, so how are the employees washing their hands?

This place is like the McDonalds of sushi places.  Don't go to this crappy place.  The decor is better than McDonalds and the security cameras watching your every move are a nice touch if you are into that sort of thing.

Maybe they figure if they are videotaping you they don't need to actually serve you?"}
{"text":"Clean, nice and modern atmosphere. Food was fine, no complaints for ayce quality. One thing that bothered me was when we asked for a booth for our party of six, and they rejected our request... Maybe because they didn't want to clean that area, but the restaurant was nearly empty :("}
{"text":"Salmon was not fresh. Weird source on torched sushi. Meat quality was not good. Not recommend to go."}
{"text":"Good service and atmosphere, deep fried items were light and not too greasy. Sushi was well crafted. Only negatives was that some of the meat items were too rough and chewy. Some items that we ordered were missed."}
{"text":"I think Heart Sushi was the first to have the ipad ordering.  It was a novely a few years ago and now almost every AYCE has it.  Anyway, the service is quite quick and the food is always fresh and good quality."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dined at Heart Sushi for the first time on Sunday night. We were quite excited to try this place ever since we heard about it because it's so close to home. We were hoping it would be the place to replace 168 as our go-to AYCE sushi restaurant.

Considering it was a Sunday night, it was actually a lot busier than we had expected. But we did not have to wait for a table and we were quickly seated. The first thing we noticed was a large party room in the back corner and it looks like it could fit about 20-25 people for those interested.

Ordering food is easy with the iPad and unlike other AYCE restaurants that I've tried, this restaurant does not require a server to review the order before sending it off. The first two orders came fairly quickly, but we noticed there was an incredibly long wait for our last order before dessert...for whatever reason.

We ordered a little bit here and there, just so we could get a little taste of everything from their miso soup, to some of their sushi rolls, sashimi, curries, as well as their fried and grilled items. Here are some of the highlights:

I liked their sushi, but I thought their rolls were just okay. A few of the rolls tasted pre-made then left in the fridge (the mango & crabmeat roll in particular) because the rice was a little stiff and cold. About their sashimi... I'm pretty picky when it comes to the quality and freshness of the fish when I dine at Japanese restaurants specifically for their sushi and sashimi. Our first sashimi order consisted of salmon, white tuna, tako and surf clams. The tako is decent, the surf clams are okay, but there was water draining from the salmon and white tuna sashimi... It tasted as if it was thawing, and the texture was different. I decided to order the salmon sashimi again, and it was better...but definitely not the best I have had in the area.

In terms of their hot items, I thought their shrimp tempura was good, and their red Thai curry and satay chicken skewers were very tasty. The beefs ribs were too salty, the kung pao chicken tasted tough as if it was re-fried (its presentation was not appealing as well), and the teriyaki salmon lacked seasoning. 

When it comes to AYCE, I always leave room for desserts. Having green tea ice cream at home (yay for Hime!), I ordered a scoop of red bean, mango pudding, tiramisu and mocha mousse cake. Unfortunately they were out of all three kinds of mousse cakes. The red bean ice cream tastes like the same as what you would get at every other AYCE Japanese restaurant. The mango pudding and tiramisu came in a small glass. The mango pudding was nothing special, and the tiramisu tasted sugarless. I also had a bite of my boyfriend's fried milk and it was not bad. 

Despite less menu items and a longer drive to Sushi 168, I find the sushi and sashimi there is always fresh... Maybe I will have to give Heart Sushi another try, but I still like Sushi 168 better. For now."}
{"text":"Great sushi, few fish options, good service but not outstanding. The salmon is great."}
{"text":"First time having sushi in Mississauga and maybe my last (kidding), but probably I will stick to Toronto an Markham Sushi. We were their for the lunch AYCE. I will rating this according to service, atmosphere and food.

Service 2.5/5: the servers seemed nice in the beginning until she asked us what we wanted to drink. I wanted lemon water and green tea. She looked displeased when i said that and the attitude changed after that. An hour into the meal we started ordering dessert. So they came by and took the plates and utensils away from us and i found that ackward because some people may eat more even though they are having dessert. The server didn't even ask if we still needed it. After they even took the ipad away and we couldnt get more dessert. 

Atmosphere 2.5/5 : it was okay. Nothing special. The table the seater sat us at was still dirty. The table was sticky so i had to use water and wipe it down myself. It was loud, but it was okay because there were a lot of people.

Food 2/5: i never expect much from AYCE places anymore and usually i don't go to AYCE now a days but my friend wanted to go try, so we did. The fish in my opinion was not fresh. Very thin slices of fish on a pretty big rice. Also the rolls were huge!! Not the right sizes and taste meh. After eating i felt a little sick when i got home and felt like that the whole day. Tempura wasnt great. Beef ribs tasted like they were steamed and not grilled or pan fried. Nothing really stood out for me. In my opinion i feel that they use ALOT of msg. I was thirsty throughout the whole day and night! Gave me a bit of a headache as well. 

I definitely will not be returning, but this place is great for large groups because of how much space they have. Also the AYCE lunch was relatively cheap. So if you want a get together with a group and not all that into the food than this place would be good. Everything was edible, but was not the best of quality."}
{"text":"Bro. It's all you eat sushi. It ain't gonna be crème de la crème of sushi but what you expect lol.
Still very good and fast and service.

Love coming here"}
{"text":"Review: 4.5/5. 

This is definitely one of the better sushi places in Mississauga, and likely one of the best AYCE joints. 

As fellow Yelper Bernie stated, the prices are high for weekend lunch and dinner. However, weekday lunch for $14.95 is great! 

The maki rolls are well formed and are a good size. The fish is quite fresh and goes down well. 

Recommendations: salmon avocado, salmon sushi. The salmon avocado is quite good!

And Ofcourse, the iPad ordering system is uber cool. :-)

Overall, it's a must try if you like sushi--especially if you like AYCE. Bon Appetit!!"}
{"text":"Best AYCE in Mississauga. For an AYCE, their sushi and skewered meats are super delicious. Service can get bit annoying sometimes, as there isn't one assigned waiter per table. The BBQ eel sushi  and the Thai Chicken skewers were the highlights."}
{"text":"Overall the restaurant was just average.

I went for lunch buffet on a weekend and it had a decent crowd but I still got seated very quickly. The service was exceptionally quick.

In my opinion they don't have a lot of variety, at least for the lunch buffet, when compared to other AYCE sushi restaurants. I very much enjoyed the salmon sushi, however, the specialty rolls weren't that great. The desert selection was very decent. Deserts at all of these AYCE sushi restaurants are pretty standard so there is not much to say about that.

I was impressed by the portion sizes of heart sushi especially when compared to other AYCE sushi restaurants. They serve enough so that one can try a lot of different sushis so you don't have to feel like you can only order a few things.

All that being said, I would still recommend going to another sushi restaurant at least for the weekend lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Food was okay. But the service was really bad. From the hostess to waitress, everyone was rude. When u ask a question, before u finish, they will give u a quick sharp rude answer. The manager knocked the sauce off, before I said anything, he said, it is okay. Excuse me? I asked the bus girl something we ordered was not there, she said no. What was that? Best part was the dessert, it taste like paint. If u ever come here, try the sesame and lychee mousse. U would never taste anything like it! Good luck!!!"}
{"text":"This is an okay place to have lunch buffet. What you see on the menu is not what exactly what it looks like when served."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi, had takeout of their Maki Set 1. And it was soooo good. I have tasted sushi from around Mississauga, and so far none have the atmosphere as beautiful as this. It's a great spot that's very modern looking and has a nice selection of Sushi. Definately recommend going here!"}
{"text":"Got ignored when my bf and I walked in. They weren't busy either, the staff looked at us a couple of times and did not assist us at all. So rude. Even if your host was on break, at least acknowledge your customers. We walked out. My excitement for trying this new place in my neighbourhood went down the drain."}
{"text":"An update: the place started using non-fresh fish. I tasted the difference right away. I withdraw my previous rating of 5 stars."}
{"text":"Delicious all you can eat sushi, with good selection. We liked the iPads to make ordering easy and so those new to sushi can see what they're ordering."}
{"text":"They were super fast with our orders! We literally sent it and In 2 mins it showed up at our table. The host was great! Super nice and very accommodating. They checked up on us making sure we were comfortable, and everything was good. Refilled our tea and water and tea. Service was great. And they had the torch sushi which became very popular lately. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, rude staff, good food though. The tables and the floor were sticky and dirty, the staff dont even talk to you unless they are telling you the ripoff prices. Nobody told us that it was all you can eat. Horrible."}
{"text":"This was my first time there, the food was OK and the service was good,

At the end of my visit with my family one very bad lady asked me, you did not pay tips are you going to pay us separate, the money you pay ($135) this for the owner,  you do not like our service!

I told her this should not mandatory it is an option and you should not ask for it.

She repeated again we serve you free of charge.

This is my last time going there."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great prices, great service, great food. Nothing bad I can say about it. Last time I was in it was - 40 out and I was waiting for take out. A gentleman came by and offered me hot tea while I waited to warm up. I was super impressed. Also the girl who took care of me gave me spicy mayo on th  house since I forgot to order it before I paid and I only had a credit card on me. I offered to get change from the car and she wouldn't hear of it. Love. These are the little things that keep people coming back. So essential to a business in such a busy and diverse area. Really makes them stand out."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST sushi I've had so far. Great ambience, great service and the food is just amazing. 
Mushroom tempura roll is a must try . This place can get packed on Sunday's so be prepared. 
You get to order your food on an iPad which makes things really quick. 

I'm only giving 4 stars because I feel like I was rushed out when I ordered dessert : the waitress asked right away if I wanted a separate bill , brought out bills first and a while later our deserts . When she brought them she didn't even let us eat in peace, and brought the machine. After the transaction not even a thank you. 


I will be coming back here for the food."}
{"text":"I am the type of person who doesn't really care too much about customer service as long as the food is good but the customer service here angers me and makes me wanna puke my food back. Waitress with the phone in her back pocket is extremely rude and occasionally gives dirty look to the customers. 
Once she poured water into my ginger ale, when i confronted that its a pop, no apologizes were made and she went off to check whether i had a pop on my bill. Oh, not even gonna mention anything about how they DROP your dishes on the table. 
I am surprised how sturdy the plates are after seeing how they are handled."}
{"text":"Birthday dinner on Snowmagedeon night. Practically empty when we arrived but it still filled up even on a snowy Tuesday evening. Service was quick. Many hands make for light work. Good was fresh and quick. Very well presented. Restaurant was clean and well decorated. Very modern. Nice size booths. Average price. Sapporo draught was cold and fresh. Excellent selection. Staff worked it when then needed to and let you relax when you needed to. Only downside was no Shumai. Roll me out and put me to bed. I'm done."}
{"text":"I've made a party tray order online the day prior for 2:30 pm. On the day, I have an email notification at 1 PM that my order is being processed and to be on time for the pick up. I didn't get there till 3 PM to pick up my order, the manager said they don't have my order. I showed them my email confirmation and they look like I am just making it up. So...she said we can make one for you now while I wait; no apology whatsoever. I sat there and waited thinking that they might compensate me by putting a few more pieces. NOPE, nothing. When it was done, I asked whether they will compensate me for my inconvenience. She said that I have already paid for online, what's there to compensate. OMG, they need to go back to Customer Service 101. I can't believe how terrible these services are. I've asked how come I get a notification and you have no info on my order, she said that sometimes it happens, and again, no apology. Wow."}
{"text":"Really slow.  My kids filled up on soya sauce.  The tablet system that they use is not working well.  Our food keeps getting directed to another table and they seem to not get it after numerous complaints that we weren't getting served.  Very slow.  Hate this place."}
{"text":"Awesome place! One of the best all you can eat in the GTA! Food is delicious, with great variety!"}
{"text":"We were there for dinner around 7:30, luckily didn't wait for too long. Ordering through ipad was awesome! no more trying to catch a server's attention (where in some places the servers would look away pretend they didn't see you). 
Not a lot of AYCE places serve red tuna sushi so we were pretty happy about it. When the sashimi came and was served on ice, we were pretty impressed. The food selection was great, host was very friendly, deco was pretty and modern, the place was clean, and didn't have to wait long for our food. Price is a bit expensive, drinks are extra. Including tax and tips, we paid a bit over $60 for 2 people. But compare to other AYCE places, this place has a higher quality. 
One thing that we didn't like, when we ordered our dessert, the server bought us the bill before the dessert arrived, no problem, as a lot of places would usually leave the bill on the table (pay when you are ready), and collect it after we finished eating. So when he returned with our dessert, just when we were trying to dig into the dessert, he stood right next to us watching us eat, seems like he was planning to watch us finish the whole thing, not going to move until we paid... I found that a little rude and strange. This (and the price) is why we only gave a 4/5 star 
We will still go back though, once in a while as a treat."}
{"text":"So I won't lie..:I do love the sushi here. I work not too far and this is a great spot to order online and pick up when we don't have a lunch. Unfortunately, the customer service here is lacking. We have ordered here many times and the order is never ready on time. Online it gives you a pick up time. Today I waited an extra 20 minutes for my order despite giving them an hour to make 4 rolls.  This has happened every time unfortunately. They also don't seem to care too much and tend to forget or not pay attention to details (asking for spicy mayo or leaving out fish eggs etc.). For a place with a ton of staff and good sushi, it's a shame they are not properly trained on customer service. 
They also don't accept debit."}
{"text":"Very impressive interior, clean white spaces. Their menu is very extensive. Kind of get lost with what to order. Food was good. I would stick to the sushi...everything else is meh. Their desserts are cute and interesting. More than just green tea ice cream or fried banana.
I would maybe come back. There are just so many AYCE places these days."}
{"text":"Fresh fish today.  Wait line was long but moved somewhat quickly.  At least they offered free orange juice and mango drinks due to the long wait.  Service was quick and cleaned up dishes quickly to make room for more food."}
{"text":"There was a live bird in the restaurant. We asked the waitress if they knew, and she said yes. I asked if this was usual, and she said no and walked away. 

It's just a bit concerning considering that it's a place that serves raw food."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and was never really disappointed. I like their iPAD ordering system =)"}
{"text":"We've been to this place several times. However, the last time we went, it was 1.5 hours before closing. So I only recommend coming at least 2hrs+ before closing because our meal was very rushed. As soon as we sat down, we were told to order everything. When our first plate arrived, we were asked if we wanted the bill five minutes later. I flat our told the server with my mouth full of food to wait, lol. Then when we were walking out, the floor was wet since they mopped. I almost slipped!!! Thank god some spots have dried up. 

Food is 6.5/10 compared to other Sushi AYCE but definitely way below 5 if compared to a la carte Sushi

Atmosphere is 8/10 I really like the decor of the place

Customer Service is 1/10"}
{"text":"The restaurant decor is very nice and modern. My family and I went on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. I must say that Heart Sushi is one of the better AYCE sushi chains (I was extremely disappointed with 168 sushi). Food quality is good, the service is quick but not friendly, and the menu option is fair. iPad ordering is a nice touch as you can see which each dish looks like, and is fun an interactive fod the kids. Will be returning soon. Good but not great"}
{"text":"Came here based on hearing loosely about this place. I know with ayce u forgo some quality for quantity but my biggest issue is that my son had a peanut reaction eating here a we ate nothing with satay or any derivative of peanut sauce and every dish we double checked to make sure there were no peanuts which the staff assured us of.  So suggests that the kitchen may not be kept as clean as it should be.  I get that u take risks with 'coming into contact with peanuts' but response from restaurant was poor.  On top of that my husband also got food poisoning - he ate only sashimi so again kitchen issues comes to mind!!  So all in all, not sure if it was a bad day for the restaurant but we won't be coming back here.  iPad ordering is nothing special and decor is ok but nothing says 'I won't come back here' like concerns over food prep and storage."}
{"text":"Great plating and such for the sushi fan out there :)  However it's AYCE and they don't take amex so i'd rather goto k&b if i'm south, but if i'm north this is the place. Very good imho."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday dinner with a small group and was sadly disappointed.  Food came slowly and waitress was rude.  It is hard to get any staff's attention. According to the waitress there is no way to know which dishes are coming or which ones have already been served so you're unsure whether you should order more or sit there  and wait.   We had to ask the waitress 4 times for a fork for one of my friends.   I asked her for a refill of my ginger ale.  She looked at my glass and said it looked like water to her so my refill never came.   Sushi was ok but the rice doesn't seem like the same sticky sushi rice you usually get at other japanese restaurants.   

I will not be coming back nor do I recommend dining here.   The are other AYCE sushi establishments with a better system and more courteous and attentive servers."}
{"text":"Great ambiance and the iPad menu is helpful although having to wait for a server to \"send\" the order seems redundant. 

The food is tasty and the staff is courteous so this is one of the better ayce sushi joints in the area."}
{"text":"I went to Heart Sushi was my dad and brother for lunch. 
Upon arriving at my table I was under the impression that this would be another typical sushi buffet. I have been to many... I was shocked to see there was no menu but instead Heart Sushi had gone the hi-tech route. Each table was fashioned with ipads so you could place your order. It was a very easy software to navigate and place your order. A server still needed to come by to verify your order but it was nice to put everything down on the ipad. The ipad remained at your table so you could see everything you ordered and whether you received it or not. It was hard to tell whether we got everything but it a very good system. 

The sushi itself was good, portions were small but it doesn't matter because it is a buffet. Fish quality was good and the selection was nice. The food doesn't elevate this restaurant much but the system they have takes away from the chaos of ordering your food. I would recommend this place for the atmosphere, service and over all experience. The space is large and very modern. You won't be disappointed. 4/5"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot however their crab meat wasn't as appealing and the hand rolls were practically impossible to eat for my friend and I. It takes forever to get seated or get food. The food is however good and the price is affordable, the waiters are extremely nice and try their best to help you."}
{"text":"Similar to many all you can eat japanses places, but the food is excellent and sevice is super quick. I woyld definitely come back, great place so far."}
{"text":"Fast, pretty good food.  Sushi was tasty.  Place is VERY busy we came at 1:30 on a weekday and it was packed to capacity."}
{"text":"OMG. The food was terrible! Nothing was fresh!! I won't go there again!   I do not recommend this place. You have better choice for this price!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi was good but not spectacular.  I don't why it's known to be the best ayce sushi in mississauga honestly. The variety of rolls is not too much and the rolls are quite similar to each other.  I just came back from the Sunday lunch and there were only 5 options for wok and stir fry dishes with no option for Seafood or shrimp?  Honestly,  I think they can do better in their options.  The coconut ice cream was very good with the fried banana.  Sushi pizza was good and I also liked their udon."}
{"text":"Went here with some girl friends on a Saturday afternoon. Despite the fact that the place was packed, we were seated almost immediately. Right away, we were given instructions on how to use the iPad to place our order. We didn't have to wait long at all to get our food. Unfortunately, we didn't realize that we can order as needed, so we put in a HUGE, massive order all in one shot. You know what that meant? There was no space at all on the table! It's ok. Lesson learned for next time. Because there will definitely be a next time :)
The food was great. The sushi was fresh. Lots of different options. They even have a little bit of Chinese and Thai food. 
Because of our over ambitious, huge order, we weren't able to finish one of our rolls. Lucky for us, the manager was super nice and understanding and didn't charge us for the untouched roll. After which we processed to immediately order dessert! Lol
Overall, great place. Everyone who loves sushi should go check it out. 
Oh and I should mention, we were sitting there for about 3 hours and never felt rushed to leave at all :) great place. Go eat!!"}
{"text":"I had the WORST customer service here. The waitress spilled the entire drink on me, my shirt, my jeans and my jacket. I was eating my meal soaking wet and I was extremely embarassed. I understand that accidents happen but NO ONE came up to me to see if I was okay. They didn't even offer to reimburse me for my meal! When I asked if my bill be adjusted to reflect the drink spilled, the waiter looked confused. I had to show the evidence of how wet I was for him to go ask the manager. The manager only offered to remove the drink from the bill and not my food item. Overall, the food is good, but the service is awful. Workers have a lack of common sense, and are inconsiderate and cheap! Never going again!"}
{"text":"Lots of options & everything has always been fresh! Bonus that the sashimi is served on ice, because cold fish tastes so much better than lukewarm. Some dishes are misses, but if you stick to sushi/sashimi then its above average for AYCE places.

Service is prompt, but if you're going on the weekend for dinner, be prepared to wait about 20 minutes or more for a table."}
{"text":"Not worth the price. Portions are tiny and food is all right at best. At least the service is reasonably quick."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite sushi places in Mississauga. Great presentation, sashimi comes on an ice plate, which keeps it at a perfect temperature. They offer items that I haven't seen at other places, such as coconut shrimp, salmon tataki, and shrimp satay. They also offer curries, which I have not stumbled across at other AYCE sushi places."}
{"text":"Our family had dinner here the other day and it is our new favorite sushi place. We loved it and would definitely come again! 
The food was very fresh and the presentation was lovely. We enjoyed their shrimp and fish sashimi as well as their grilled beef and steak dishes. I personally enjoyed their scallop sashimi in lemon-ginger juice! (We ordered everything twice!)
Aside from the food, the service was very prompt and polite. We always felt welcome and never ignored. The interior had a very simple, clean, and pleasing appearance. I really liked what they did with the flower petal projections on the wall. Very pretty!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on Yelp (paying close attention to sushi quality and speed of service) I decided to make reservations for my group of 24 people for Saturday evening.  They told me that normally, they would not take reservations as it was during their busier hours but they were nice enough to make an exception for me with the condition that I call in by 5:00pm to confirm my final head count.  My group was a team of dragon boat paddlers who had just finished racing in Milton for the day. After a day of competing and not being able to eat any type of normal food except fruits, tuna and lean deli meats throughout the day, you can imagine how hungry they were.  

We arrived at around 6:15pm and the restaurant was still not too busy at the time.  They gave us a semi-private section at the back of the restaurant (which worked out great because we tend to be a cheerful and loud group).  Heart Sushi succeeds where other AYCE's of the same concept (iPad ordering) fail. Heart Sushi's sashimi was fresh with great plating and while the menu didn't have as many items as the Markham AYCE's, it was enough.  They had non-typical AYCE items such as Chinese dishes (sweet and sour chicken) and Thai dishes (red/green curry)

This is the only AYCE where sashimi arrives on a bed of ice!  Food came out blazing fast which scored major points with everyone in the group because we were starving. It was so handy to be able to check on what we ordered and determine whether it came out, using the tablet and app.  Servers were also consistent in making sure we used the tablet.  If something didn't arrive, they would first check our order list to confirm whether we had ordered it.  Then, they would ask us to put in the order on the tablet and tell us that they would go pick it up right away (and they did bring it right away).  From an management standpoint, the staff are well trained on executing operational procedures!

If the service and quality stays consistent, I would not hesitate to book Heart Sushi again for our annual post dragon boat regatta dinner!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday and dare to say it's one of worst sushi places I've been to. I'm rarely in the West end but was in the mood so i decided to try it.   Service was OK but the food was not fresh and pre cooked. Salmon and steak teriyaki not fresh and cold.  No natural juice just teriyaki sauce all over.  Pork and shrimp dumplings over cooked and falling apart.  The sushi was OK BUT lots of rice. Beverages were extra. I tried the hotnsour soup and it was not bad. Glad I'm from Markham where the sushi places are plentiful and so much better.  HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"The restaurant is large and has a very modern interior. The quality of food tends to be inconsistent - sometimes acceptable, other times not so great.  I've never thought their food was amazing.  I wish their sushi's didn't taste so cold, maybe they make them in advance and refrigerate them.  Even the shrimp in the dynamite roll is always so cold.  I live in the Heartland area and due to convenience and by request I have taken friends to Heart Sushi over the last year a few times but I must recommend \"Odai Sushi\" across the street; the makis cost a buck or two more, but the food is definitely worth the price since it's made fresh on the spot and tastes great.  At Odai Sushi, you are received with a hearty greeting and you get exceptional customer service, which leads me into the customer service at Heart Sushi - \"NON-EXISTENT\".  The customer service is extremely unimpressive at Heart Sushi, the hosts and waiters next to never smile, don't ask how the food is, don't offer to refill the tea but they are more than eager to get you out the door by expediting your bill to you within half hour of sitting down (this has happened to me during 3 separate visits now).  Today as I was eating with a friend, while we still had 1/3 of our maki rolls left on the boat, the waiter approached us and asked whether he should pack our food up for us in the midst of us eating our dinner.  After we told him we were still working on the food, he kept starring at us from afar to see when we would finish up (more than 50% of the restaurant was empty).  Fancy decor doesn't outweigh the poor service for me.  I gave them ample opportunities to redeem themselves - they fail terribly!"}
{"text":"After trying lots of AYCE places all over town I believe I have finally found The One! The restaurant is beautiful and Even though it was super busy as it was the weekend the service was surprisingly fast and the food was great. Tried various maki rolls and each one had its own unique flavor (usually at AYCE places I find all sushis taste the same) will definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"This was Blockbuster?  Great renos.  Impressed with the iPad menus!  Simple enough to use, or so we thought.  We ordered some food but after nearly 15 minutes, we received nothing but our seaweed salad.  Finally about 10 minutes later or so we received our sushi and sashimi, and then nothing.  The rest of our order showed as \"sent\" on the iPad but we got nothing.  So the waitress took  a look at our iPad and did some magic and had to check with the kitchen to figure out what had happened with the rest of our order.  After this hiccup, the rest of the night proceeded flawlessly.  

Everything we ordered tasted great-the best being shrimp tempura, flaky, light and crispy.  The only thing we had to order again because it was quite tasty was the mango pudding.  

Heart sushi is an excellent option and a great alternative to Yang's, Wasabi or even Prince.  

We were there at 5:30 pm and got a table right away, but by 7:00 pm it was packed with a bit of a line-up."}
{"text":"If you want to waste your time and your money, here is the place. I've visited the Mavis location and their new new location on more than one occasions but last night was by far the worst experience. Not only were we seated for 2 hours and haven't brought us the rest of our orders, but they made us pay $90 for 6 items of food and drinks. It might've been busy, but that doesn't excuse for this terrible service we got last night. At least 168 sushi wasn't that bad. I used to enjoy eating at heart sushi, but now I refuse to ever step foot into that restaurant again."}
{"text":"Fast service, food came really quick and empty plates were cleared from our table promptly. However, the quality of the food wasn't super impressive or memorable and the lunch menu seemed a bit limited. One of my favourite things to order whenever I go to a sushi place is spicy salmon roll, so I've had a lot of spicy salmon rolls in my life lol but the spicy salmon rolls here were probably the worst I've ever had anywhere. They were all just filled with mostly \"crisp\" and hardly any salmon as if they were trying to conserve/cheap out on ingredients during the lunch hours when people aren't paying as much. Would probably not come again.."}
{"text":"Been there this past Saturday and it was packed.  Placed looked nice but I was a bit dissapointed with the service - yes it was fast however the orders came in wrong.  Food quality was just ok...I've had much better at Kura Sushi which is near by.    

Don't think buffet is for me I guess.  Find buffets usually lack the quality since they have to prepare them so quickly."}
{"text":"Favourite Mississauga AYCE sushi, and I've been to a LOT of them (168, Kanda, AYCE in SQ1, Sushi Sushi, Momiji, Prince..). I'm a big fan of sashimi, and they get it right! The rolls are good, a good ratio of rice to fillings. They also have a lot of non-sushi options (generally Thai or americanized Chinese) which is great for my BF who's not as into sushi as I am. iPad menu is nice, but I would go here even if they didn't have it.

Just a tip: You can get the dinner menu (aka, sashimi!!) at lunch, but you'll have to pay the dinner price. They do have the items available, though."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch with coworkers. A great overall restaurant. Ordering is done on iPads. 

Only issue is the lack of hard core sushi selections."}
{"text":"Went to Heart Sushi yesterday and here are my thoughts. Entered and sat down, and told our host we were from out of town and first timers. He told us it was AYCE and the price. We said we came in for just a couple rolls and could we see the menu to decide, (did I mention first timers...?)
You would have thought I did a dump on the table. He turned and left and came back with the menu. After checking it out we decided to go AYCE and then he said the table was needed at 7 pm, it was almost 6 pm and we'd have to leave then. OMG! 
I told him he was making me anxious and I felt rushed as I'd never been there and had no idea how quickly food would arrive once I had ordered. He finally slowed his roll and put on his customer service hat and assured me that he would not kick me out before I had enjoyed my meal fully. Breathe out! Using an IPAD menu for ordering, I could say that there was a variety of items, though not a variety of raw fish items on the sushi menu. I get why, we were doing ACYE. But good customer service would offer a more varied a la carte option if that was what we were feeling instead of bullying us into choosing ACYE. I'm from LA, I'm used to paying for good sushi and have overpayed for some average sushi too. We still managed to have a good time, it was close to where we were staying and all items ordered came quickly, at the right temperature and tasted competently prepared."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi. Heart is our go to place for sushi when we are entertaining friends. 
The fish is fresh and the ordering via iPads is seamless. Menu items have bright photos and detailed descriptions for the uninitiated The decor is also modern and fresh. Check this place out."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times, but sadly the quality of the food has really gone down.

Customer service was awesome as usual, we were greeted and brought to our table promptly. No issues.

But the freshness of the food was horrible. Out of 8 people 3 of us had GI issues and got food poisoned. Don't bother, there's plenty of better AYCEs out there"}
{"text":"I asked three times for a dish and never received it. Heartland location much better."}
{"text":"First off, I went to this location when it first opened up in Heartland Town Centre and was quite delighted with the selection, atmosphere & its interior design! Thus visiting this location about four more times!

However, yesterday night's will be my last visit. We went for dinner around 6:30pm. They were able to lock in my requested reservation about an hour before my dining time - which was great! Upon seating, all the food we ordered on the iPad arrived fast - but not hot?! The fried dishes were hot, however the other dishes were not. The sashimi we ordered was not very fresh at all, fresh sashimi would have a nice shine to it. The surf clam lacked its elasticity. Their rice was over cooked in their rolls. The enoki beef rolls were more beef than enoki. Yakitori and their chicken teriyaki were the same flavour - or should I said flavour-less... there was no seasoning at all, yet the edamame were doused in salt... and to top it all off, the waiter stated they didn't place an order for green tea ice cream?? What? It is such a staple in any AYCE Japanese buffet !!! 

Overall, I enjoyed the company I was with more than I enjoyed the food. It was a very disappointing last visit to Heart Sushi."}
{"text":"Closed due to a fire. 
It was a very large fire, so I imagine that it won't reopen for quite some time."}
{"text":"Food was good. The one server (male) we had a was little odd. Brought us the bill when we didn't ask before we ordered dessert and then told us you can't order food after you ask for the bill (the bill that we never asked for). The place was empty and it was  2pm on a weekday too so not too sure why he wanted to flip our table so bad. But the food was good. The AC was so high I think I may have gotten pneumonia."}
{"text":"This place is much better than the Heartland branch. There are many reasons for me to say this. 

I like the concept that they don't use the traditional way of ordering food at a sushi place that would be a paper and pen. They had the iPad which is way efficient and way faster to get your food to the table. Sometimes if can be a bit tricky, because for some reason my table order was going to some other table and I had to wait for almost 45mins for the fried rice, but the manager was great she knew what was happening on my table. She gave me 15% off for my next visit. 

The food was fresh, I could say this because I had ordered the sashimi and they didn't smell at all. I judge the freshens of a sushi place by the smell of the Salmon because that shows if the sushi is fresh or not.

Service:4.5
Food:4.5
Decor: 4.5

Without a doubt, I would definitely come to this place again."}
{"text":"Wow, HEART SUSHI is the best sushi place I've eaten in a long time.  The food  was fabulous, service fantastic & fast,  all the staff very friendly and helpful.  The whole iPad menu ordering such an innovative concept and $15 for all you can eat lunch, you just can't go wrong.  If you like sushi, this place is a must try."}
{"text":"Due to the number of positive reviews, my wife and I decided to try this place out.  I have to say, I'm not very critical about places I eat but after dining here I was quite disappointed.

We ordered some rolls and right from the plates they were falling apart before I could lift them with my chopsticks.  A lot of the fried items were a little overcooked.  There were a few items that were good like the cheese dumplings and the torched salmon.

The disappointment really was at the fact that during our visit, which was an all day dinner menu day, a few of the items never came and after a few inquiries, were finally told that they were out.  I have to say the price for dining did not live up to the food or service at all.

I will not come back nor recommend this place due to our experience.  The attendants weren't very accomodating and a lot of the times even when you wave or call they will just walk right past you."}
{"text":"I was the first customer at this restaurant when it opened on June 17. I did not write a review then because it is very unfair to write a review based on its opening day. There were a few opening day problems, but today (Fathers Day) went quite well. This restaurant has a different vibe than their other location. It feels very calm and peaceful. Unlike the first Heart Sushi, it has a couple of Teppanaki tables. I haven't tried that yet, but was suitably impressed by the chef that I saw in action. The menu is similar to their first restaurant; however I was very pleased to see the addition of scallop sashimi and  grilled scallops. I highly recommend the sweet shrimp sashimi, the scallop sashimi,  the salmon tataki, the salmon tataki salad and the mango salad.

I have eaten at about 25 AYCE restaurants in various parts of Ontario and my favourite one is the original Heart Susi. With time, this location could supplant it as my favourite AYCE restaurant."}
{"text":"So today I decided to check out this spot and its the first time I can really say 10/10 all around.

Very prompt and professional service. The highlight for me is the fact at every table your menu is an ipad and that when you choose all you can eat you literally get everything on the menu.

Amazing quality food and dobt let the name of this place fool you the grill chicken,bbq ribs, deep fry bananas etc. :)"}
{"text":"We come here often and would rate this as one Mississauga's great placed for Japanese Sushi or All-U-Can-Eat"}
{"text":"The food was alright, a little on the oily side. Service was terrible, forgot most of my order and plates were not cleared until advised to do so. Also, so many flies in the restaurant I felt like I was back in India. Terrible location for all you can eat. The one on Bristol and Hurontario is way better."}
{"text":"This was a huge disappointment. Extremely overpriced in general for AYCE, and to make things worse, the actual food was atrocious. 

The maki rolls dry and untidy. The flavours overall underwhelming. The dim sum offerings tasted previously frozen and reheated. The meat offerings we tried also tasted off, as if they had been frozen or were synthetic and processed. 

The fish itself was fine, no issues with freshness, but based on the rest of our experience, I won't be surprised if I feel sick later. 

The dessert was the saddest part. We ordered the mango, red bean and coconut ice creams and they were served to us as re-frozen melt, we could see a ring of icy water around the bowl and the ice cream itself was soup. Disgusted and will never be returning. 

I've had better sushi in a mall food court."}
{"text":"Decided to try out this ayce sushi spot with my boyfriend tonight.  Arrived before 5:30 and only the booths were occupied, but by 6:30 the place was packed, so definitely come early if you want a table right away.  Nice bright and modern restaurant with high ceilings minus all the typical cliche Japanese knickknacks.  Loved ordering from the iPad which had pictures for all the dishes.  Though be advised that you get much smaller portions then the pictures show.   This actually is a blessing if you want to try a new dish and are not sure if you will like it.  This way you won't waste a ton of food if you find you don't.  The sashimi arrives in glass bowl filled with crushed ice that is illuminated from below by coloured LED lights.  Very cool!  The quality of the sashimi was good and the handrolls were crispy and tasty.  The rolls were on the larger side but that's usually the case with ayce places.  Loved the coconut shrimp and the steak teriyaki was tender.  Softy drinks are extra but were reasonably priced at $2.  Loved the fact that you had more choices for dessert than just ice cream.  The shot glass tiramisu was a nice light treat after a filling meal.  All in all we loved the variety and choices and enjoyed each and every dish we ordered.  We found the servers very pleasant and were quick to clear used dishes, refill our drinks, and bring our meals.  We will definitely come back and bring some of our sushi loving friends with us."}
{"text":"I was ignored for a very long time. My dessert arrived before my food. The food was also lousy. Skip this place and go anywhere else instead. This is my second time here.  Not sure why I came back. Save your appetite for better quality food and better service. I waited for my bill for 20 Minutes. My food took ages to come. Desserts had a gross freezer smell to them. I'm quite upset about my visit here."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick fix in the Mississauga area, Heart Sushi is a spot I would only recommend if you're looking to fill your stomach with every cuisine under the sun. This restaurant has no theme to its menu, from sushi to dim sum, it has it all. While some may find this appealing, the quality of the food is as diverse as the offerings - up and down. If you're looking to have quality sushi, I would explore alternative options. Overall, the experience was pleasant but nothing exceptional to warrant a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Ordered a la carte, and although the selection and presentation was great, the sushi itself left something to be desired. Upon arrival, we were told there was no paper menus and that we could choose off the iPad system that they use for AYCE. Unfortunately the prices were not listed on this menu and therefore we had to pull a menu up online. Nothing bad to say, but nothing that would make me return."}
{"text":"Overall, a pretty good sushi place.

Where they gained points:

- Variety: they probably have more types of sushi than any other sushi place I've ever been to
- Quality: this might be the best tasting sushi I've ever tried
- Decor: I usually don't notice decor. I'm a guy, and I'm too focused on what's on my plate. So for me to notice decor, it has to be REALLY noticeable. And it was.

Where they lost points:

- Speed of service: not too fast, not too slow. Medium.

Would I eat here again? Absolutely!"}
{"text":"Typical sushi place. Good food none the less, classic ipad menu with lots of variety. Service was decent, most places it is terrible so this place is a step up.. But they're quick to get you out of there, which is not customer friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"First time try for their lunch menu. Food are pretty good, especially liked the kalbi and they make good red curries. Other Japanese dishes are average. Servants were speedy. Nice place to go for lunch except that they don't provide sashimi at lunch like most other ayce."}
{"text":"Sushi is good and many options for people who do not like sushi as much. However we went around 6 pm on a Saturday and when we ordered a beer they were out of all 3 kinds that we asked for (the kegs needed to be changed) and two servers couldn't remember what beer they had on tap. Seemed a bit strange. The food was good but they put way too much sauce on top of the rolls and one of the rolls we ordered came with a mango sauce on top that wasn't on the menu. My expectations would not have been so high if the prices were not as high as they are. This place needs some work."}
{"text":"Tried this place on a recommendation from a friend, who said the dinner buffet was completely worth it. $24.99/person - went on a Monday night, 8:30pm. New AYCE sushi place in Heartland. 

Decor: 5/5 
Service: 3/5 
Ambience: 5/5 
Food: 4/5 
Price: 3/5 

This place is a little more expensive than other AYCE places in Mississauga. They have an iPad menu going, which I really liked - and also felt was better executed than 168 Japan Buffet, the other AYCE sushi joint in Mississauga that also has iPad menus. 

The decor was REALLY nice! I admired it the entire night. The space was enormous, with even a little semi-private room in the back. Everything was modern and sleek and clean (it's still a relatively new place). The ambience was very warm and lively. 

The service was one of the biggest drawbacks. I understand we went a little over an hour before their closing, but I've still never experienced that kind of service at other places. I usually expect less than par service from AYCE restaurants - none I have been to have been particularly great with service, but this stood out in a bad way. Firstly, it was very spotty and confusing - I didn't know who our waitress was as we would get multiple coming out and helping us. Secondly, they really rushed us; they made us pay before we finished dessert and rushed us into ordering ice cream which seemed nonsensical. 

Now, onto the food. We LOVED everything we ordered from the non-sushi roll menus. The red curry was surprisingly tasty, they had salmon tataki (which isn't usually on AYCE menus) which we also enjoyed, the salmon salad, hot & sour soup, the Thai skewers, and sashimi were all amazing. I loved the coconut shrimp we got as well. Also, the plating for all of this food was so cute! +1. The sushi was overall very good and felt very fresh. We ordered 5-6 different kinds, and liked most of them. However, we didn't enjoy the two deep fried rolls we got - they felt too doughy and mushy, and we've had much better. The pink lady roll a must try. 

Overall 4/5 and would go back! I hope they improve their service because everything else was great and the price can be easily looked over should the service improve! Nonetheless, I still highly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Came here again, I actually won a lunch from the Drop Your Business Card Draw! I was super excited. The food came quickly, it was very fresh and we enjoyed our time. Waitress was so pleasant. The gentleman at the front was also very pleasant and attentive. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"It is sad that we won't be able to enjoy the food here. 

I made a reservation for 11:00 am today for our company party at the restaurant. We called it couple times before 11 am to confirm our reservation, unfortunately no one picked up the phone.

Even though no one picked up the phone, we still decided to go based on the great reviews here and also think that maybe the staffs are too busy to handle our phone call. We also believed that the restaurant should start operating after 11:00 am based on information we found on its website,. 

We arrived around 11:15 am and realized the restaurant is closed. We walked around the building and didn't see anyone around. It's quite disappointed since we were very  excited about this meal but we won't be able to actually try. 7 of us then need to find other places to have our celebration done. 

I would recommend you call them before you go, just to make sure."}
{"text":"It says something about Heart Sushi that I couldn't even remember the name for the restaurant until I ran across the business page from a friend's profile, and realized I had been there three months ago. That's how bland and unmemorable the experience was.

I came here in February of this year with two friends on a lark because of the recommendation of a mutual friend. Although the food was decent, the service was horrible and left a bad impression on our group, to the point that they swore off going there again.

The best, and most interesting, part of the experience was being able to choose your orders through an IPad. Everything on the menu is laid out fairly clearly, and you don't have to fuss over making a wrong choice when you can easily add or subtract items.

My group attended at 8:00 PM on a Saturday evening. The ambience was quite nice, and the booths had a real insular feel to them. I started off the evening by getting a drink and figuring out what we all wanted.

We waited half an hour after our initial order to get our first batch of food (mixed sashimi, handrolls, salmon rolls), and the service just got worse and worse from there. After a certain point, our server took the IPad with her when she left, and we had to verbally give our dessert order to another server. It took another 45 minutes after that (and flagging down multiple servers) to finally get them to deliver mango shots, which was entirely absurd.

The worst part of the night was getting the bill. We were getting the sense that they were trying to rush us and another handful of customers out as quickly as possible, as one woman explained to us that they were closing up. At 9:45 p.m. On a Saturday. While the Nando's next door is still hopping and they're in one of the biggest districts in Mississauga. We even saw waitresses milling around, getting their coats on and talking to each other as we were finishing. It left a sour taste in everyone's mouth, and I told my friends not to leave a tip for the generally terrible service.

I think a lot of the high-starred reviews are from people who generally haven't eaten at a lot of AYCE restaurants. What we received was decent, but not worth the $30 and tax. I'd be better off going down to the Mandarin at Erin Mills and paying the same price for sushi and scores of other menu options. At least there, I don't feel like a number on a dial while they're trying to rush us out as quickly as possible.

I was planning to give the restaurant 3 stars because of the food and ambience, but downgraded it a star for the poor service. My only hope is that the AYCE sushi subindustry explodes and we get more choices here in Mississauga over the next few years."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I have to admit they blew me away! 

The service was amazing and fast. the staff are friendly and very helpful. From the moment we arrived till we left we were blown away. 

We ordered and less than 5 mins food was at our table. There was rice, salads and some chicken skewers. 

The whole night was awesome. Every time we order the food was there under 5 mins. It was hot and tasty. 

We love the grilled good and the tempura.

If your ever in the mood for awesome sushi, grilled meat or tempura make sure go here, I know i will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I think the place is pretty amazing, the speed that the food comes to the table is incredibly fast, def had a good time"}
{"text":"It's about 2 stars overall but since this Yelp page is clearly full of fake 5 star reviews I downgraded it to 1.

The only redeemable things were the decor and the serving staff. The service is indeed really good and there's nothing bad to say about the servers.

Now the food... I went there expecting typical AYCE quality which is not very high. Even with these low expectations I was disappointed.

Having been to numerous sushi places this is by far the worst I've been to recently if not ever. Fish grade is very low... they don't have red tuna or octopus and there's no sashimi during lunch even though lunch costs over 20 and tea isn't included. The fish they use is really cheap like tilapia and even salmon doesn't taste or look right. Even such a basic thing as miso soup didn't taste good. Same for tom yum. Kalbi was very chewy and based on that I didn't even order striploin. Handrolls were the only thing that seemed decent to me and my parents had a Chinese chicken dish which they said was alright. The worst thing though was the salmon avocado roll. I can't even call it a roll because even my first time making sushi turned out better. There was almost no fish and it was rolled and cut very sloppily. I actually can't believe I was served it like that. I had to make a comment to the waiter because I kept staring at it in disbelief.

At this price point this is unacceptable. You're better off going to any other AYCE place or even better grabbing a chirashi bowl from high end authentic Japanese places - you'd be paying 20-30 either way. Definitely avoid."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try this place after reading so many good reviews online. You can tell the place is new when you step into the restaurant. The setup was bright and modern. Greeters were friendly and the wait was not long. The menu was displayed on an iPad which I found was unique for ordering food (new trend sushi restaurants are starting to implement). 

The service was amazing! Our food kept arriving at our table very quickly and the servers constantly roam around the restaurant checking every table for beverage refills.  

The food was top notch! The sashimi was fresh, the rolls did not fall apart, and the presentation of certain dishes were really pretty. The only complaint my friend had was the quantity of the rice, noodle and curry dishes were too small. The desserts were the normal selection at any sushi restaurant (green tea, red bean, fried banana etc.).

Overall, I liked this place and it's probably going to become my new sushi place since it's so close to where I live."}
{"text":"Alright selections of sushi, unique plating, decent dim sum and delicious desserts. Drinks were not included with the ayce,  which was slightly disappointing considering the price is expensive per person! Dinner was very nice, very cozy but the music selection seemed very out of place. Although, it wasn't a bother to everyone, it didn't quite match the setting of the restaurant.

Our server was extremely friendly and had great service.

If price isn't a problem, wouldn't mind recommended this place if you're in the East end. But they're better options."}
{"text":"Food was good, and really not as bad as some reviewers have alluded to. Services was prompt and friendly, and I also like the fact that my orders came pretty quick without error. Perhaps I went during lunch so there were less people and therefore less prone to errors. The only thing that I did not like was that when I told them it was my wife's birthday, one of the male server said that the 50% discount can only be applied if the bill is paid in cash; good thing my bank was in the mall so I was able to get some cash. However, turns out I made a trip to the bank for nothing because when I got my bill, Mandy allowed me to use my credit card no questions asked. Not sure why this happened, but it felt like a dick move. Aside from that, everything was good. Hopefully next time the restaurant can make up its mind about accepting cash or credit."}
{"text":"Was disappointed with this place. After reading all the great reviews I found it to be nothing special. The sushi was decent, but no real difference from AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"Average sushi. The sashimi was watery which I suspect that it was not fresh but frozen. Their sushi and Cooked options were pretty good. Their renovation and upgrade of using iPad to order is no different than most sushi restaurants anyways. 

Not worth ayce when there are better sushi and non-frozen sashimi out there."}
{"text":"Today was our first time at Heart sushi. The sushi was amazing and was made fast. The drinks were delicious as well. We really like the IPad ordering system, ad it really speeds things up IMHO. 
The ambiance of this place is really warm and super gorgeous. The restaurant is clean and the staff is super friendly. 
Definitely will be back for more."}
{"text":"Here for the first time on a Sunday for lunch and it's busy. The  exterior of the establishment would not draw me in as it has a big box impersonal look to it but the interior decor is very pleasing.
We waited about ten minutes to be seated and gazed over a sea of people enjoying their food. We got a booth and proceeded to order. Our order started coming as we expected in a AYCE restaurant. Food was for the most part very tasty but not very hot. The sushi looked like they had made it with no love. While everyone else was getting plates after plates to their table ours had come to a standstill. When we asked our waitress if the rest of our order was coming she said she would look. Well she never came back so we flagged down the Host and told him about her and also how there was no smile or engagement whatsoever. He apologized and said it was her first day. My wife said is it the first day for all the waiters as there was no smile anywhere. Well the Host which turns out to be the owner brought us the rest of our order. The over all experience was just ok. If you dont mind impersonal service and luke warm food in a very busy restaurant then this place is for you, as for me I'm on to new experiences......"}
{"text":"First of all I love the place... a soon as you get in it has a good vibe, look and feel to it. I visited the place with fellow awesome yelpers to enjoy some All you can eat sushi. Lets get down to logistic of the place:

Seating: quite a bit of place to seat and the booths are amazing with amazing round things on top.

Ordering system: quite sophisticated as you have to order in a tablet.

Menu: its not just a sushi joint the menu was huge and had Thai dishes as well.

Service: was quite good the place a busy but we mange to get our food on time.

Staff: was quite friendly.

Food: Well it was all you can eat and we tied a lot and I mean it a lot of sushi and sushimi and all the fish were fresh. The seaweed salad was addictive and we also tried 2 of the Thai dishes which were quite good.

The green tea was not too done so it wasn't dry and was severed an nice tea pot. The dessert of Mango pudding and red bean ice cream was awesome!!!

Price point: is slightly expensive on the weekend. 

Parking: plenty of parking as its in heartland town centre. 

Its worth the visit so check it out if you are craving some fish!"}
{"text":"15 mins without water or service I don't understand why they won the reward 2014. Services very minimal. Staffs not friendly only the manager smile. But they do try to make up their mistake that I do give them credit. For restaurant been open for years but hasn't grow on service is really disappointed.
Food always come at speedy fashion. Do not expect quality to be top notch but only fair to what you paid. When compare to restaurant in east Toronto like York or Scarborough area this one way below the standard."}
{"text":"I would say most of the dishes were good. There were 1 or 2 we didn't like. It's a typical all you can eat type of quality. You can't be a sushi snob and come here! 

I didn't love anything I ordered... No dishes compelled me to order another. 

Overall good, but I'd probably go somewhere else if I have a sushi craving. 

I was pleased with the efficiency of the iPad ordering system and how fast all the food came out. Nothing was missing which is nice! 

The menu is also very extensive for those who like variety. This review is more of a 3.7/5 realistically."}
{"text":"If it was possible to give them no stars I would, this place took forever with the first order with miso soup that was almost as cold as the iced water they served. And after watching our server helping others besides our table on a night that's not even that busy. We later complained about the slow service and asking where our food was and she takes the menu with her.. how are we suppose to order more? After waiting 20 minutes again they give us not even 1/4 of what we ordered. We are only a family of 5 so I can't understand what's going on. Worst sushi experience ever. Need to hire better waitresses."}
{"text":"Time for an update: 

Unfortunately during my last two visits here...quality of service and food have decreased!! It's too bad cuz it was definitely one of my favourite sushi places to go to. 

During my most recent visit, I noticed different employees. Maybe they've changed management?! Regardless, this restaurant is kinda shitty now...and will not likely return...

1. Many items throughout our meal never came. We would ask about it and our server couldn't tell us much so we ended up just ordering more of the same thing. We ordered two rounds of soup...which none came until we kept asking about it. We finally got it halfway through our meal. We noticed it was happening to other tables too.

2. The food that did make it to the table isn't as good as it used to be. Some flavours were different and some oilier (is that a word?) than usual.

3. Our waiter didn't know much and wasn't very personable.

Overall, not a great experience. Probably won't come back for a long time, it'll definitely be my last choice of sushi restos!"}
{"text":"I was there on Friday and enjoyed my meal. Over the last decade, I have eaten at about 40 AYCE restaurants across southern Ontario and this is one of the best. The interior decor is bright and welcoming. With a low ceiling, it is a tricky place to work with, yet their interior designer did a first class job. The primary colour is gold. Mirrors at the east and west walls, make the place look bigger. There is a beautiful light fixture in the middle above a round table. When I was there, a party of six in business attire were enjoying their meal at that table.

The servers were friendly and efficient. The sushi chefs prepared the sushi directly in front of the customers. I noticed that a couple of writers claimed that the food was not fresh. Everything that I ordered was fresh. I do wonder if the naysayers, had an ulterior motive.

My meal consisted of assorted sushi, torched sushi, sashimi, tataki and various kitchen items. I liked everything that I tried.  Desert was not necessary, but I had some any ways. The Ipad ordering system was easy to use."}
{"text":"Service was fast. The sushi was tender and fresh. There are also cooking tables still there from the previous owners.  Sushi can be all AYCE or ordered from the menu. Bathrooms are clean and we'll stocked. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Kitchen items are certainly a lot better than the sushi itself. There are far more superior ayce sushi (and alot cheaper) out there, considering how much their weekend dinner buffet is priced at $29.99. They have pressed sushi but the ratio of rice to fish is heavy. You'll be full in no time. This place is all hype. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"If I could i would rate 0 star for this place. Sushi heart at the food court ordered a poke salad bowl. But got only a bowl with some lettuce  garnish and salmon and tuna lots of sauces some breadcrumbs. Not like in the menu description with cucumber, avocados and some other veggies. Went back to the counter complained  about the SALAD BOWL. Then the girl at the counter said this is lettuce and some other vegetables which was not. Paying $ 15.76 for a few thinly cut iceberg lettuce sauces and salmon and tuna. After arguing the guy behind the counter add some lettuce. What a big disappointment. Save your money and go somewhere else for salad. Salmon does not taste fresh at all."}
{"text":"$28.99?! $28.99 for pretty much nothing.
Heart Sushi has pretty much demoted themselves from 4* to 2 1/2*. Just another average sushi place.

Now that they've been open for a year, I guess it's time for standards to start slipping.
Last night was the second time we've been back recently.
The 1st of the 2 occurrences was for weekday dinner; We were disappointed to see their menu had been shortened, but prices had gone up?
Told myself, we won't be coming back.
Alas, my date convinces me to try again for a WEEKEND dinner - hoping there would be change.

NOPE.

Weekend dinner is now $28.99 - not because they've added crab legs, or oysters. They've even REPLACED their raw scallop!
They no longer offer sea scallops, and have replaced the baked & sashimi options with the tiny bay scallops..

TL;DR
- Sashimi was NOT fresh ..sashimi should not be warm or smell like that
- Fish was warm :( 
- Aburi (torched sushi) was mediocre
- Kitchen foods arrived cold
- Menu items removed
- Sea scallops no longer offered
- Price increased to $28.99 for weekend"}
{"text":"Loved it!  Favourite AYCE sushi in Mississauga.  Worth every penny.  Being able to order via ipad menu was simple, straight forward.  It was easy to know what to order when every menu item had a description and picture.  Made the meal fun and entertaining along with tasty! Only improvements, include pop in AYCE price... Or at least come fill up my water, with ice, more than once!  Will totally go again."}
{"text":"Really good service I'd literally put the last bite in my mouth and the plate would be gone, like they so fast with that shit you don't even see them do it, it just be gone"}
{"text":"wasn't a fan. 

I think I'm truly spoiled by quality and variety of sushi in Markham that it's quite difficult to really give anyone else a fair chance. 

however, my poor rating doesn't come from the good, because it was very tasty and filling. my rating comes from their horrible service. when I told them i wasn't doing all you can eat; they pretty much didn't care to serve us anymore. I had to call someone for water, my apps and main. no one cared to ask if we wanted ice cream but brought us our bill."}
{"text":"The sashimi was good. However, all the cooked/grilled food was horrible. The tempura was cold and greasy. The chicken and steak were cold and seemed over heated cause they were so dry and hard. The manager said all the food was fresh, but they aren't as busy and it was prob leftover items from the lunch rush. It was definitely not worth $30 per person for dinner. I came with friends from out of town. Was embarrassed and disappointed we got such bad service and food. Will not be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been many times and know when I want an \"all you can eat\" option, this is the place to go to in heartland town center."}
{"text":"Came here for ayce with a few friends on a Friday night. It only took 5 minutes to get seated but the place was pretty packed. I really liked the ambiance of the restaurant. They had some cool booths for mid sized groups and I liked the cherry blossoms theme going on. It's definitely a lively place... at least on a Friday which is always a good sign.

The service was ok! They have the electronic tablet ordering system so it is a bit more convenient/ easy than the  pen, paper, and ring system. I found that their service in getting the food to our table was kind of slow but again it was a Friday night so I'm going to cut them some slack. I found that some of the servers weren't the most polite but I think that was more of a language barrier. How about hiring staff that isn't struggling with communication??

Now, the food. It was pretty good! I really liked the crispy spicy salmon roll and the Thai coconut shrimp. We ordered a lot of food and some dishes were misses but 85% were hits. All in all it was a great ambiance, good food, and just a little below average service. I would come here again."}
{"text":"The food is is pretty average and the atmosphere is okay. When i went they sat me right under the A/C vent and it was freezing. I asked for water 4 times before it finally came after probably 15 minutes of waiting for a simple glass of water."}
{"text":"I've got nothing but love for Heart Sushi (see what I did there?). But why wouldn't you make a cheesy joke like this when expressing how wonderful this place is! 

Nestled into the HEART of HEARTland town enter (I'm here all week people - try the sashimi) it's no wonder that despite arriving to a half filled restaurant that within minutes it was brimming with excited diners. 

Decor is very nice IMO, fancy in a way that tons of extra suburban space can only supply. Tall ceilings large booths and an emphasis on... You guessed it, hearts. 

As is the growing trend with AYCE spots they've done away with paper and pencils in lieu of tablet ordering. I've determined this is now a bare minimum a place must have to receive full marks. 

On to the food, top to bottom, without going through everything we had, it's all excellent. I'm thoroughly impressed that an AYCE joint has been able to maintain such high quality levels for this long. Anyone who is a sushi (AYCE) regular knows about the 6 month curse. Huge portions, over the top quality and cheap prices in the first 6 and then KABOOM - crap city sushi. Not Heart, there has been no such disease clogging their arteries, the freshness and quality still beats strong. 

Unique standouts: 
- an array of full grilled fish (with heads and tails still on) such a Mackerel
- mango dessert (like a créme brûlée except just mango and no fire)
- quality sashimi portions
- ability to order the dinner menu for lunch as long as you're willing to pay dinner prices
- cast iron tea pots at every table
- large soup portions. 

Easily the top sushi joint in Mississauga and dare I say GTA. Try them out and you be the judge. 

Also worth noting, they won the Yelpie award for Yelpers choice best sushi in 2014. And the proudly display their award at the front as soon as you walk in. 

Eatcrest out."}
{"text":"Mediocre. Came here on an empty stomach so ate a lot since it was AYCE. However, the food was not fresh and you could tell it was not quality food. They also tend to forget a lot of your orders and never bring them to you unless you reorder it. Service is good. Location is great. Would consider coming back but not my first choice."}
{"text":"I've been to Heart Sushi (Heartland location) 2 times for AYCE lunch ($15/person). Overall, Heart Sushi is a fantastic place to eat, but only if you don't eat the sushi.

I don't really care about décor/service, but i'll briefly mention it. Décor was good, definitely a place my more \"fancy\" relatives would like, and service was fine. No problems whatsoever. I've never really had any missed orders or anything like that. iPad menu is good, probably great for people who are indecisive so they can add/delete items to their hearts content and finalize their order at the end, but for me, I don't really find it that much better or different than paper + pen. One good thing though is that they have pictures on the iPad. Note that right after ordering desserts they take away the iPad and hand you the bill. What I did was ignore the bill they handed me and ask the waiter for more. I felt like there should have been a \"pay bill\" button on the iPad to avoid this.

As for food, the Heartland Heart Sushi has fantastic non-sushi dishes. Korean, Thai, Japanese, Chinese, etc. The meat is always lean (no fat meat that I personally dislike) and all of the different dishes taste great. Strong flavours, great variety, and unique dishes. They nail all of the different Asian dishes. The sweet and sour chicken is better than a lot of Chinese restaurants. Unlike in other places, with the teriyaki chicken and chicken skewers they give you enough sauce. The Korean bulgogi I've had here is better than the ones I've had in downtown Toronto from authentic Korean restaurants. In fact, the dishes are so good that I have not tried a non-sushi dish that I don't like yet. Portion sizes are also amazing; very small so you can try nearly everything in one visit (not alone of course).

Sushi now is a different story. I heard from my friend that the AYCE dinner sashimi is fantastic but I have not tried that. I can only say that for AYCE lunch, the salmon sushi is bad. The fish is fresh but the problem is that it is sliced so thinly that it's almost see through. When I eat it all I taste is rice. I purposely tried it both times I've been there just to see whether it was just a fluke. It wasn't. The maki rolls are okay and they are generous with the fish, which is somewhat odd. Funnily, I taste more salmon in the salmon/avocado roll than I do with the salmon sushi. but there's nothing special about the rolls.

Desserts are really good. Very unique, and have subtle flavours. I like that they aren't too sweet. They come in really small shot glasses, so usually I order like 2 - 3 just for a single person. The tiramisu is great, as is the black sesame mousse, the fried banana, and my favourite the fried milk thing.

I will be coming back to Heart Sushi, but not for its sushi. If you come here for sushi you'll leave disappointed. Think of Heart Sushi kind of like Mandarin, but with a larger variety in types of Asian cuisine. In that sense, Heart Sushi is great."}
{"text":"Location/Service
At Fairview mall, where Spring Rolls used to be. Entrance is outside the mall. Plenty of parking available and access to TTC. 
Nice decor inside, giving off a bling bling fancy feeling. 
Staff were also nice, friendly and approachable in terms of understanding the menu. 

Food
This place does all you can eat and a la carte - so eat according to your preference. They also have takeout and lunch specials (Mon-Thurs).
I ordered takeout for dinner as I was in a rush. It was a sashimi/sushi/tempura set (sorry forgot the menu item) priced around $18-$20. Food quality wise is acceptable, fresh fish and not overly battered tempura. The picture may look like a small portion, but it was quite filling! I also like how they provided an actual environmental bag for the takeout. 

Overall, I would come for mostly takeout as it's convenient. Menu items are similar to what you see in other sushi restaurants (not too outstanding for me)."}
{"text":"Compared to other AYCE restaurants, this might be one of the few I'll frequent. Their food comes out fast, but a little warm. The quality of the sashimi is the same as any other AYCE restaurants. But their rolls are good, especially their mango banana roll. I like the menu and I find the quality to be comparable to other restaurants. Nonetheless, I like it enough to keep returning."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite ayce in Mississauga. Decor is fabulous. Everything comes in super tiny portions so you can try everything. I hate going to ayce where rolls come in sets of 6 or rice/chicken dishes are enough for 4 people ... really limits what you can try. Food presentation is also very pretty. Been here twice so far, once for lunch and once for dinner. Free green tea. Will be back next time I want to be in a food coma!"}
{"text":"This is not a good sushi place for the following reasons: 1. The place was so loud. 2. The food is so bland. 3. Its an all day dinner menu for jan 1, 2017 but most of the items were not there. 4. We waited for our orders such as white tuna , edamame and beef cubes just to find out that there's no more food to serve. 5. The servers dont dare to tell u that they ran out of food. You pay for dinner but the food is for lunch only. What a rip off. Not coming back to this stupid place again. You dont even deserve a 1 star!"}
{"text":"I have been trying to find the best sushi in Ontario and I have now found it at Heart! Amazing atmosphere love the iPad menus also so much variety on the menu and even allowed us to order things that weren't listed in menu. Lots if servers so you don't go long without someone cleaning plates off the table and delivering food. Excellent experience and I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Very low quality sushi.. it was never like this before. I don't know if they changed management or ownership but the quality dropped. Service was so bad I was gonna leave as soon as I arrived but stayed for the sake of my kids.. it gotten so bad from that moment. Will not recommend this place nor will go back even if it's free."}
{"text":"Was here on their first soft opening day.  Was immediately disappointed that tea was not included, this is ridiculous given the price per person.  Overall the food was below par when compared to the other AYCE around the area.  They have a wide variety of food however it's like they haven't taken the time to make sure it all tastes good.  The service was good but overbearing at times.  I mean if there's nothing left on the plates, you don't have to ask if you can take it away every time lol Also you don't have to tell me what every dish is that you put down, I know what I ordered.  I'll be back a little later for an updated review as I'll cut them a little slack since they weren't \"officially opened.\""}
{"text":"Love the food here! Walked into Heart Sushi for a weeknight AYCE dinner. Been here a few times already so I know what to expect. Yes they use the iPad ordering system so food comes quicker than the old pen and paper system. Some food doesn't arrive so you have to remind a server to follow up. Thankfully, this time around every order started trickling in around 5-7 minutes after hitting the Send Order button.

I stay away from ordering the Chinese dishes because they do taste a little bland. Besides when I eat at an AYCE sushi restaurant, my appetite is screaming for sushi or sashimi! Every time I have eaten here their sushi/sashimi is fresh. Their Korean kalbi pieces are good at times when we are served the good parts but sometimes I do get a lot of fat on the trim.

So that you are all aware, when you are seated in the back-to-back banquettes, sometimes the person behind you has a tendency to move around a lot. Do not lean back on the seat if you plan on resting for awhile or you will feel the impact of the person behind you.

For the most part though, place is clean and most of the staff speaks English well. Food is great and the presentation of sashimi (for dinner only) on an illuminated bowl of ice makes my dining experience a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Not the greatest. 50% of the food is drenched in soy sauce. Don't recommend coming here way better options elsewhere. All fried food were stale."}
{"text":"Beyond disappointment. The service was AWFUL.  I ordered edamame.  When it didn't come, I asked for it and was brought two orders at different times. Edamame is usually severed warm or hot, it was stone cold.  The sushi was HORRIBLE.  Eel sushi is always served warm, again ice cold.  This is likely the worst meal I have ever had in Canada.  NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Never again!! under average food. shrimps r not fresh! the watress with long pony hair and glasses is rude. talking not looking at you, brought our chopsticks and ordering ipad away even We haven't finish. wont come anymore!"}
{"text":"Appropriately named since it's in the Heartland area.  I came here for lunch and was fairly impressed.  A sleek design to the restaurant  goes well with the use of modern technology.  Very innovative use of the Ipad ordering system.  The user interface is very intuitive to use and the images of each item really helps with the menu selection.  I think the dinnerware and food styling is above average.  They take the time to make the food look good before serving.  I enjoyed the Golden California roll which is a cali roll with tempura batter and fried.  The salmon rose and spicy salmon sushi where also nice and buttery.  The crispy salmon roll was also very good. 

Warning FYI:
 Something new I tried was the escolar sushi.  It had a nice texture but had a more pronounced fishy taste.  I looked up escolar fish after and was shocked to find out it is banned in Italy and Japan!  If the Japanese aren't eating this fish...should anyone else?  It can cause some bad health effects so don't eat too much.  Other restaurants may also try to pass it off as butterfish.  I've probably ate a ton of this stuff unknowingly at other Sushi restaurants.

I thank them for naming the item as it is and not trying to pass it off as butterfish or something else.  The service was really good and prompt.  The place is child friendly and don't charge kids under 4 years.  ...but that escolar.  Tell me if i'm over reacting."}
{"text":"Not the best place for AYCE sushi. The kitchen food is decent and the sashimi is usually too wet because it comes on half-melted ice. The presentation of the food is really nice though. It's an ok place for groups, but not good enough for the price you pay and the quality you receive. The service is a bit slow at times."}
{"text":"First visit to this location and it was the worst experience!. Started off ok as we ordered our sushi and fried food items. The back kitchen items came out promptly but the 90% of sushi that we ordered never arrived.  45 mins past and yes.. 45 mins as there's a time stamp on all your orders on the iPad and not one sushi plate came.  Tables next to us received their items before us even when they arrived after us.  We asked two waitresses 30 mins in and because of their lack of English, they weren't much help. \"I'll check\" and they never returned.  So I asked for the manager who offered one of the AYCE meals to be covered.  I explained to him that after waiting for so long, my appetite has gone because I already ate the back kitchen items.  He then told us to just leave and don't pay.  So with that, we picked up and left only to be stopped by 3 of the waitresses demanding us to pay.  We told them the manager told us not to pay and leave.  They kept insisting that we needed to pay.  We told them to use their mics to speak to the manager to get things straightened out but they didn't.  As I was walking out, I told the manager to please communicate with his waitresses so they don't keep stressing out.  Ya, he was still pissed I guess and again, told me to leave.  At no point did I raise my voice or make a scene.  I simply tried to get the waitresses and manager to align with me but he if anything seemed more upset about the situation than I was.  In the end... It totally did suck that I went to an AYCE sushi and had no sushi :("}
{"text":"We decided to check out the newest location of Heart Sushi in Fairview Mall. We have been to the Bristol Mississauga location many times and were wondering if our dining experience will be the same or if they would improve upon it. Sad to say that, we felt that it didn't match our previous experiences at the Mississauga location. I would rate it at 3 1/2*. 

The positives: the decor inside the restaurant is really nice plus they have a nice patio setup too. Similar to their other locations, they have the iPad ordering system. The salmon sashimi is really good. It's cut thick. The kalbi (Beef short ribs) are outstanding. Better than most Korean restaurants. The service was outstanding but bear in mind that we got there around 4:30pm for dinner and it wasn't that busy. 

The negatives: this restaurant is not cheap. A weekday dinner (Monday to Thursday) cost $30 while a weekend one cost $34. With that price, you expect better quality dishes. The lack of tuna sashimi was disappointing plus the only other choices of fish sashimi being escolar and tilapia. The rolls were average at best and their cooked dishes were a bit bland. They only have the Red Tuna on their Sushi. 

I'm not sure we will be back again."}
{"text":"The food is definitely 5 star. The decor and environment is wonderful and while the staff was extremely friendly. My only beef was that the food wasn't coming fast enough. My friend and I found ourselves twiddling our thumbs while waiting for the additional rounds of grub"}
{"text":"Worst sushi we've ever had...it's been agreed by both me and my husband. 

You can barely call the rolls \"roll\", as they were just poor pieces of rice balls - not even in a round shape. I don't expect more from an AYCE place, but at least you could make sushi with some attention other than just pinching the ingredients.

Fish was not fresh too. The red Thai curry got watered down a lot, that spicy tofu was not much better.

They offer 10% off if you give them a good review on your social media. That's why you may find so many high ratings on Google, Facebook, Ins and WeChat. The manager kept telling us his name to make sure we mentioned him in the review.

It totally not worth the price, a very disappointing dining experience. 1 star to its relatively good service."}
{"text":"I have been here several times now. The service is great and really fast. I rarely have to wait for a table. The sushi is good and fresh. I really wish I could give it a 3.5 rating. I am giving a 3 star rating to Heart Sushi because it doesn't meet the quality of 168 Sushi which I rated a 4. You order food on tablets and I noticed that some items I ordered didn't come. The atmosphere is okay but too bright for dinner."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, the food quality is quite good and on par with some of the other Japanese Buffet restaurants out there.

My one issue with my experiences here is the way the staff are treated. I'm not saying that the service is bad. They've always treated me quite well but I often see the waitresses being yelled at or being mistreated. There is a palpable tension and low morale.

If it had a happier atmosphere I would probably be a regular here."}
{"text":"This place is gross.  They served us rice that tasted a day old and, in fact, everything didn't taste fresh. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Went here a few times now. I like it here because the place is clean, has great service and close by.

I had dinner here with my girlfriend. We had AYCE and ordered with their easy to use iPad menu. Salad and sashimi came out first, and pretty quickly. The salad was not drenched in sauce like the last few times i've been here, which was good! I ordered my favourite spicy salmon rolls - mediocre at best. I liked the green and red california rolls. The edamame did not look fresh at all compared to other times i've been here.

They have a stamp card where you can redeem a free dinner (only Monday to Thursday) after collecting 10 dinner stamps (one per dinner at Heart Sushi).

Overall this place can fill you up and the food is average."}
{"text":"The food and service here are nothing spectacular; however, the food presentation is above par for an ayce and they do have quite the assortment. It's quantity over quality here. They are trendy and usually busy in the evenings; be prepared to wait to be seated."}
{"text":"We went there for BD occasion , It was really Yammy and nice! the food is very good and fresh .. The staff from another hand were not very friendly they lake the smile and the welcoming face this a negative point for them some didn't speak English and it was hard to get information from them about the menu .. Anyway I'm definitely going back again!"}
{"text":"We went there a couple of times, the first time was ok. Nothing impressive. But today the experience was horrible. We arrived at 2.50 after sitting down the manager tells us that the last call is at 3.20. Well if you have a last call don't let people in after 2! We thought we had enough time to order but the waitress comes back at 3 and tells us the last call is in 5 min! 
The food was rushed in a suspicious way, the salmon tasted old and looked unappealing. From what we saw we think they leave the fresh items for the dinner menu. 
We are not coming back."}
{"text":"I had super high expectations for this place after reading the reviews on yelp. I mean.. I really wanted to like this place because the service was good and the presentation was fantastic. However, compared to other sushi places i've been to, their food is really mediocre. The sushi wasn't that fresh, and a lot of the rolls were lacking flavour. I was mostly disappointed with the blowtorched sushi because it was barely torched and it just wasn't good. Definitely not worth it for almost $30 per person."}
{"text":"Well I had an unexpected late lunch/early dinner with the girls :)

Let me tell you, Heart Sushi don't play! Lol

We ordered so many dishes and one after another they were coming out the kitchen faster than we could even find a spot on our table.  I've never seen food fly out the kitchen this fast.

For AYCE, this place is a good spot to go to if you're really hungry and want some food in you quick.  Good flavour in a majority of the dishes that we tried.  They have quite a good variety of foods to choose from the iPad menus.

The servers were very polite, our empty dishes were cleared just as fast as the food coming out.  The decor in the restaurant was quite modern and trendy.  A good place for groups if you need to as they have tables in the middle which could be used for larger groups.

My daughter and her Aunty loved the French fries lol you'd think we would have loved something else more other than the fries.  But you can't help what you like.

Anyway, this is a nice place to hit up randomly when you want some sushi or other side dishes they have."}
{"text":"Very good food. Very reasonably priced and excellent service. The lunch special comes to around $15 after tax. The menu is good."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi restaurant I've ever been to. I've gone to places from London to Toronto and everything in between. The service, food and time to receive the food once ordered were perfect. There were no mistakes with anything we ordered and the ambiance and decor of the restaurant was quite classy. This is definitely the kind of place I would bring my family or friends or dates to. The tastes and flavours were out of this world. Never had anything this good before."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The interior is clean and modern. Service is very fast and efficient, food is pretty good for an AYCE place. I really liked the fact that they use an electronic menu with a tonne of options. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Really good sushi. We went for lunch today (Monday) so it was a bit cheaper. $47 for three of us. The service was fast and most of the waitresses were nice.. except for SHREK the waitress. She was a bit grumpy and green.. really didn't listen to what we had to say. Maybe it wasn't her day.. maybe she wasn't accepted to the university of her choice.. anyways.. the owner (or manager) came over a couple of times to ask how's the food. Baby bear loves the sweet potato tempura and especially the cakes. Momma bear went hard on the egg plant and tom yum soup! Me .. I went hard on the Kolbi beef ribs and the california rolls. The Korean spicy beef was really good. We must have ordered about four servings. All and all, Heart Sushi is a great place to eat. If you want to save money.. go Monday thru Thursday for lunch. Thanks Heart Sushi! Domo Harigato! ????????"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi restaurant 
Good service yummy food !!
Good price !
You can order using an iPad which is really cool.
You don't have to leave ur seat and food will be serviced 
Fast and friendly!
I recommended it for anyone who is a sushi enthusiast"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night with my coworker. We were traveling for work and had a craving for sushi. When we got there, the place was busy but not too packed. We got seated immediately. 

We went with the AYCE option. It was a good bang for your buck - the combined price of two special rolls a la carte would have exceeded the AYCE price.

The ordering process was seamless. The waitress showed us the electronic ordering system, which allowed us to submit orders directly to the kitchen without having to call her over every time we wanted to make an order. 

In terms of the food, we enjoyed the sushi and cooked dishes. The restaurant had a diverse range of Asian cuisine - Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and Thai - but we mostly stuck to the Japanese and Korean dishes. 

In particular, I loved the Kalbi ribs; the meat was juicy and tender. I also liked the salmon tataki and the rainbow roll. The sashimi was only ok, tasted a bit frozen but good enough for AYCE. Drinks were not included in the AYCE menu, so we had good ol' iced water.

Overall, the food was quite good for an AYCE restaurant. If I happen to be in the area down the road, I would be happy to come here again."}
{"text":"Tasty, fresh food, nice atmosphere. The service is decent, however, some dishes take a ridiculously long time to arrive. Not my favourite AYCE sushi spot, but it's worth the money!"}
{"text":"Just another AYCE sushi place in Mississauga. Honestly, the menus is tiny compared to any other place. The variety and quality is no different than a 168 (which has so much more selection). The service was absolutely terrible, the individuals with (black shirts) just serve and collect plates, while the actual hosts (pink shirts) are so limited. About 10 individuals with black shirts and 2 staff with pink shirts. 

Again, nothing special. Poor service, small menu, don't expect much. There are other AYCE that are much better."}
{"text":"My go to sushi place. If you're not going at a high traffic time,the food arrives in a timely manner and the service is pretty good. Their sushi is awesome and I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"First yelp review here. Went here on New Years Day for buffet lunch. It was $16.99 for the lunch before tax and tips (Weekend/Holiday rate).

The food was overall pretty good. They serve the common mix of japanese, thai, korean, and chinese entrees that you'd see at a sushi buffet. For me the highlights were: the freshness of their fish, sweet and sour pork, pad thai, red curry chicken, and deep fried milk (a dessert and is in one of my pictures). The rolls and sushi were better portioned than usual. I'd recommend taking a pass on: spicy salmon rolls (were sorta bland) and the tiramisu (tasted like a sponge soaked in espresso because it was pre-prepared).

The sushi was very nicely portioned: no excess rice and the fish slices were not that thin. The salmon was also very very fresh that day (YMMV). I was certainly impressed. 

The service was very timely and polite. I saw the owner/manager walking to every table, including mine, to check that their dining experience is to par.

Heart Sushi's definitely off to a very good start and is worth a try if you're in the neighbourhood. I plan to go back to try out their dinner buffet."}
{"text":"Not very happy with the quality of fish served in sushi .. every piece was dried out, as if we were having smoked fish sushi. The tempuras and salads were nice. The environment is nice, but food quality is low, then no point going there again. It's a one star for food, but gave two stars for tempuras and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Decent fusion AYCE sushi restaurant. Decent selection of standard Asian dishes like sushi, sashimi, rolls, dim sum, Korean dishes, stir fry, and etc. Overall quality of food is decent and the service is fast. This place is one of the few that serve sweet shrimp for sashimi. Overall recommended."}
{"text":"I can not review the quality of the food as I was not served.  I placed an order through their online ordering system. Shortly after having placed my order I received a phone call informing me that I was not in their delivery area. I live 4.8km from the restaurant! Disgusted with their lack of customer service."}
{"text":"Heart Sushi is beyond 5 stars!  I would give it 6 stars if I could. I went at around 3pm for a late lunch and the restaurant was still super busy. However, we were seated promptly and right next to the tv...which was important because the NFC Championship game was on and I politely asked them to turn the channel from the Intense sport of Curling to a more calm and interesting sport of Football.  The host and waiter were super nice and handed me the remote controller and I was able to watch football and eat sushi at the same time!!!!  

We ordered our Sushi from the fancy iPads along with plenty of other cooked dishes such as salmon, beef, chicken balls, and tempura.  The Sushi was delicious and I ordered my usual salmon, eel, tuna, butterfish, and tilapia sushi.  All of the food came out quick and fresh!  

Our server was attentive and catered to our every need! My cup of water never went empty and our dirty plates were taken off quickly and efficiently.  Heart Sushi is one of the best AYCE Sushi places I have ever been too and will definitely be going back!

Price for lunch was $16.99 per person which is reasonable and dinner price is $26.99.  Well worth the price!  Parking is easy and there are plenty of spaces!

I absolutely in love and head over heels with Heart Sushi!"}
{"text":"Service was good, small variety of suchi and selections. The atmosphere was good.. Nothing was especial, wont repeat my experience there!"}
{"text":"Fast service, and food tasted pretty much like any all you can eat sushi places. The restaurant itself is really nice with tons of seating places. Larger groups are placed near the back which is great since everyone can be seated at one table. The bathrooms are huge and gorgeous!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Good service. Nice decor. Decent prices. Good variety of food and presentation"}
{"text":"Absolute Go-To place for Sushi!!
The prices are outstanding and the portions are very large. I'm most impressed by the quality of salmon they offer, I've been to Asia many times and the salmon offered at heart sushi are not only large portions but so tender!

The rolls are very large and the prices are so affordable, the service is always great and highly tend to your needs.

I do reccomend to go for the a la carte menu over the buffet, as unless youre starving you won't have to order many times.

The only thing I have an issue with is the Tuna, tends to taste off and  served warm."}
{"text":"Tip #1:  online reservations are not taken after 5:30pm for Friday or Saturday evenings

I had decided to finally try this establishment being that my uncle recommended the place to me and I've seen it several times being in the Heartland area.  I had a friend coming over on Friday so we had planned to go here for dinner.

We had arrived shortly after 6pm hoping we wouldn't have to line up and we didn't have to.  There seemed to be about maybe 10 tables that were free when we arrived.  The server seated us and asked us if it was our first time there and I had said yes.  He explained how the ordering works using the ipad and how to browse the menu etc.

Now for me this is automatically something I can pick up right away because I'm familiar with how to use an ipad etc.  For others say if my parents went by themselves, not so much.

Tip #2:  ordering is done through an ipad.  Individuals not familiar with how to use a touch screen device, bring along a kid and treat him/her! :)

The variety of the menu is very good.  Our server explained to me that all drinks are basically \"pay\" except for water.  The pot of tea my wife ordered wasn't charged so he must have meant only pop, alcohol etc.  Either way I had ordered a 1 liter big Sapporo draft.  The drink is 8 bucks but it's basically 3 beers in one huge mug.

Tip #3:  for us at least, it seems the teas (5 different or so) weren't charged... free?

We had basically tapped our way through the entire menu from starters and all sushi, hot food, etc.  The desserts it says on the ipad to ask your server for them... so basically it's their way of telling you that you're done?  I hadn't actually added anything to our original massive order because there was no need.  We had ordered a lot and as expected it keeps on coming as you consume and clear plates, more come until everything you have ordered has come.

I had ordered 4 different rolls (rainbow, green dragon, spicy salmon and some tempura shrimp type roll, miso soup, wakame salad, edamame, 5 different hand rolls, 6 pieces of salmon sashimi, nigiri: unagi, red tuna, etc.

For hot foods I had ordered General Tao, seafood fried rice, chicken wings, kalbi, chicken katsu, coconut shrimp, tempura shrimp, tempura crab, tempura vegetables.  For some reason we did not get the chicken katsu (fried cutlet).

Tip #4:  The rice and hot food portions are really individual or smaller servings as was the seaweed salad.  The seaweed salad was literally 2 mouthfuls.  The rice was maybe enough to fill an 8oz glass.  The kalbi which was 3 pieces.  The pieces were small... one bone... usually used to like 3 or 4 bone side cut as they are already skinny to begin with.  The General Tao had maybe 4 or 5 pieces each about the size of an unshelled peanut.  While it is all you can eat, perhaps the sizes described will give you an idea of how much you want to order of each?  The salmon sashimi pieces we received were maybe 2 inches by 3/4 inch in size.  Again while small you can order as much as you like so have an idea of how much you need say if you are a table of 6 or so...

This place is all you can eat so really if you wanted to order more you can right?  I didn't try to order more because we had enough and we ordered basically everything we could eat, only leaving 3 pieces of cut roll out of everything we had ordered that is all we couldn't finish.

We ended it with dessert.  Two of us had ice cream and my wife ordered a mango shot.

Overall the food was ok.  Nothing blew my mind and some of the servings seemed rather small (small sashimi slices, kalbi pieces, even rice) so you have to keep it in mind so you have an idea of how much to order.  Overall we were full so we ordered properly considering we left almost nothing as not finished.

I would have liked to have seen red tuna in the sashimi menu considering you can get all the white tuna you want and all the red tuna nigiri.  I've seen some people order a lot of red tuna nigiri and just eat the fish and leave the rice to basically counter that move.  

I was sort of disappointed that they didn't have salmon skin rolls at all (maki or temmaki) since it's one of my favorites and really isn't expensive.  We're not talking  Toro here...  Also lacking I didn't see anything with hamachi or yellow tail etc.  Again I can probably attribute that to the higher priced fish and the AYCE worry...

Overall I think the place is ok and the price is what you would expect for an all you can eat sushi place.  I've been to better though and I will probably go to another few again before I try this place out again.  I wasn't dissatisfied but Heart left me feeling I was missing something whether it was the tiny portions (even the seaweed salad) or lack of sashimi or other traditional favorites I've used to seeing.  

The choices overall are diverse though.  They have many different noodles, meat dishes etc.  You can see what they look like because everything has a photo on the ipad."}
{"text":"Alright, I'm going to be straight up and probably offend some people with what I'm about to say... but if you're a \"I love sushi\", from a NON-Asian descent, kind of person, then you'll be fine eating here. However, if you are of Asian descent, and I'm assuming you know your sushi tastes, then this place will be a huge disappointment for you. 

Service - 2/5. All the servers are non-fluent in English, which is totally fine. However, it seems like they're all international students from China, which is also fine. What is not fine is taking China's customer service and bringing it here. For my fellow Asians and travellers, you know how restaurants in China operates; fast, rude, rushed, literally doing whatever it takes just to get you eating and getting the f*ck out the restaurant while collecting your cash on your way out. This is exactly that kind of restaurant. Yes, I know AYCE have never been known to have satisfactory service, but this is a real real real disappointment. Food was being slammed on our tables as they came. We weren't even done eating some dishes yet and the waitresses would say \"Can you put this piece of sushi onto this other plate?\". Unless you're extremely low on plates (which you should not be), then there is no need to disrupt my family's eating environment. 

Food - 3/5. Honestly, I've had better sushi rolls from a grocery store. The only reason I give them a score of \"3\" is because there's variety. You have everything from Kalbi, to hand/maki rolls, to vegetarian rolls, to general tao chicken. Hand rolls were plain, nothing special. Kalbi, great, although a little fatty. General tao, although unsure why I wanted to try it, was not good. I've had better at Panda Express.

Decoration - 3.5/5. Beautiful, comfortable. Sadly the service and food just aren't on-par. 

Overall, would never come back. There are way better AYCE restaurants in Mississauga."}
{"text":"There are a lot of mixed reviews here. My experience here has been very very good.  The food was actually really good and the quality and taste were upon top notch as well.  I have been here on multiple occasions and every occasion has been pretty consistent with the quality and service.  The place uses tablet-based ordering system and every time you click order the food comes within a few minutes. The place does not require you to ask a server to place an order on the tablet like 168 which makes it incredibly convenient and easier.  You don't have to wait around for the server.  

Food 5/5
Service 4.5/5

{"text":"I had been to the Heartland location before, and it didn't impress me at all.  But my friend insisted to try this location too (she went to the other one with me too) because different chef can be better food (I didn't think so but I was outvoted by her and my husband).  The hard rice, over spicy soup and baked scallop/mussel, over cooked fishes are the some of the problems with the food here.  The grossest thing is got to be the scallop sashimi, it is not even scallops, it's like half cooked fish chopped into smallest pieces to disguise it.  The shrimp sashimi is not fresh, it has no taste at all (it's like been in ice water for a long time).  The only thing that was good was the salmon sashimi and the ice-cream collection (coconut ice-cream is pretty rare in all-you-can-eat).  My friend ordered a tiramisu that taste like wasabi instead (probably not washed shot glass, it was served in a shot glass).  The service was fast but I wonder if most food is already cooked up in the back and heat up a bit before serving.  Overall, I won't return here for all-you-can-eat again, might try the cooking table in a future date."}
{"text":"This chain is so bad, the other location is the same.  This one doesn't even have cooking table, I will not be returning here at all."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Saturday night.  I was very impressed. The decor is beautiful and the space around the seating is spacious. Service was attentive and very friendly. Be careful ordering the scallop Sashimi as each cup comes with about two 2-3 pieces. Sashimi tasted fresh and the food was really good. The only downfall for me was the garlic cubes. Wasn't really what I expected but it was okay. One of the better places to go to for all you can eat sushi."}
{"text":"Place: it looks nice. A long and high ceiling place. Cleanliness is good. Not excellent but good. 

Food: sushi comes in 1 piece, other cooked foods come in smaller portions. Which is not bad, since it's buffet. Just be aware. 

 we went for lunch and there were no sashimi.  Only sushi. Salmon, white tuna, mackeral were all pretty good.  The rice is not true Japanese sushi rice. It crumbles and falls off the piece of fish when I dip it in the soya sauce. 

Lunch had Soups, dim sum dishes, sushi, rolls, Korean BBQ beef, ribs (kalbi), salads, udon and ramen, jap pizza, fried noodles, desserts (ice cream, mousse, mango pudding)

The Best was the kalbi, 3 pieces per order. Just order enough of these and you'll already ate your money's worth. The Korean buggogi beef was also very good. Tender, flavourful.

Service: it's iPad driven so food came as ordered. But all the waiters and staff are from China and with that comes their usual rough, not too polite culture.  Like throwing down the wasabi and ginger dishes on the table when we sat down. When I walked to the washroom, a Mandarin speaking staff lady behind me yelled out \"excuse me excuse me!\" To make me get out of HER way. Amm, ever heard of being polite to customers and give us the right of way?  

On my way out I saw a staff lady pushing the big dirty dish trolley heading my way, so I figured I'd be nice and stepped out of the way. She then stopped the cart infront of me,  another lady walked near with her pile of collected dirty dishes and she dumped all the dishes into the cart tub right infront of me!  Geez.  

A real Japanese owner would be so ashamed. 

Price: went up from a few years ago (so don't trust the photo you see here on yelp Menu). See my photo here. 

If you think of this place as a buffet for cooked Japanese and Korean food with some raw Japanese food. Then it's a good restaurant.  

I would come back for lunch , the price is good for that. Dinner? I think there's better Japanese buffets for that price. I'd prefer Fork n Spoon (JJ's) selection for dinner."}
{"text":"Sushi is good, fresh so that's a plus. Well designed plates. Not just slopped on. 
The staff is a little....cold? Not very friendly or talkative,but I've almost come to expect this. Tables and booths are clean, common typical sushi joint look. 
You order off of iPads, that's a plus so no messed up orders."}
{"text":"I decided to check out this AYCE sushi resto after hearing about the great reviews and the awards that it won for being the best in Mississauga. It was totally worth the late lunch on a Sunday afternoon as the place was packed at 3pm. Despite how busy it was, we were seat right away and conveniently in front of a TV where our server was nice enough to change the channel for us so we could watch the NFC football game.

The restaurant has a nice modern ambient feeling with lots of tables and booth so its the perfect place to accomodate large groups. It was also interesting because they have IPADs where you could order your food and is it a lot more convenient because all the items had a picture a description of what it was with the ingredients. I think that all AYCE sushi restaurants should offer this feature because not only it is convenient but also more efficient.

The food came out at a decent time considering how busy it was and the quality of the sushi was above average as I usually dont expect this at a sushi buffet. The sushi pieces were the perfect size and nicely made such as the salmom sushi, red snapper sushi, and white tuna sushi. Some of the cooked dishes that we ordered were the beef teriyaki, kalbi ribs, grilled eggplant and tempura all of which tasted delicious. 

Lastly, I was pretty impressed with the service. We didnt have to wait for our table even though it was busy. Our server was friendly and always attentive to everything we asked for. He also allowed us to order more food from the lunch menu even though the time had passed after the cut off mark.

Overall, this is the best AYCE sushi restaurant so far and the reputation speaks for itself! I highly recommend this place for lunch ($16.99) or dinner ($26.99) if you are ever in the Mississauga/Heartland area."}
{"text":"Ambiance: Nice chandelier at the middle

Food: Salmon sashimi and the torched salmon sushi tasted pretty good. 

The flavour of the red curry was nice but can be thicker. 

The octopus shown on the menu indicated grilled but it is fried similar to the dim sum style-not bad

They charge for tea so it is not like the other AYCE.

None of the items we ordered were missed. That is a plus. 

If your party was larger, the sashimi are served with a rose on the bowl. Overall, not a bad experience. Convenient location."}
{"text":"I was in the area for business and saw the reviews and I like sushi so thought I'd check it out. First of all they have a very bright, active, and somewhat noisy atmosphere. I was by myself so it wasn't much fun but if you're with a bunch of people this could be a really fun place. The service was great, the manager helped me with a couple of wine tastes before I landed on one. They bring the food out really quick, although I'd suggest placing your app order before the main order as I ordered edamame as an app and it came out after the sushi rolls. 
One other thing to be aware of, this is considered a BUFFETT. You don't actually go to the buffet line but they bring out the food at different times, whenever it's ready. You place your order on a tablet that's on the table which is cool, but it doesn't allow for any customization of your order. I wanted cucumber with one of my rolls, the menu didn't offer the choice but I was able to convey that to the attendant and she was able to get it for me.

Also not being aware that this was a one price buffet I was kind if surprised when I got my bill as it was more than I expected. If you know going in that it's one price then no big deal.

I'd go again if I were with some people but it's not the place to go by yourself."}
{"text":"The service is really slow for the teppenyaki tables. We had reservations at 6 and we didn't receive our food until 7. We were not very satisfied with the service we received. Food was mediocre. Not sure if service is better for AYCE sushi but will not be coming back for teppenyaki."}
{"text":"Went here with my family this past week. We live less than 10 minutes away and when we heard that an AYCE sushi place was opening that close to us we had to go.

Food was amazing, I especially enjoyed the green dragon roll, wonton soup and chicken teriyaki roll. 

The udon was also very good and so was the ramen! 

My dad ordered as much sashimi (salmon, surf clam and a few others, can't remember them all) as he could handle and said that it's probably the best he's had in a while. 

The staff were all very nice and I really liked that the owner/manager checked up on us almost every time he walked by, it's a big difference from other AYCE places and even restaurants that I have been too. I also saw that the manager was also helping to get out food orders and serve tables. I don't think I've seen that before.

Dessert was wonderful (though I didn't have much as I was already quite full) my parents had a strawberry and mango mousse cake and I had vanilla ice cream. I tried a bite of the mango mouse cake and it was delicious!

All in all I had a wonderful time here. Food was great and so was the service! I'm definitely coming back again with my friends and family."}
{"text":"Heart has been my go-to AYCE sushi spot for almost 2 years. The booths are comfortable, service is decent, ordering is easy and the food is fresh, delicious and comes out fairly quickly. I like that they're constantly adding new items to the menu. My only minor quibble is that the last time I was there, the chicken curry wasn't as good as usual."}
{"text":"My only gripe is they didn't have tuna on the menu. Salmon, mackerel, surf clam, and a few others. But no tuna. Staff was great. Just disappointed with menu selection."}
{"text":"Upon entering, you'll notice that the decor and size of the restaurant is above average for an AYCE Sushi place but the most notable aspect is the iPad that you're provided with to order.

The iPad made ordering easy and efficient. Items did not get missed like at other AYCE Sushi places. The selection was larger than most featuring the standard Sushi/Sashimi/Tempura/Teriyaki fare with a few unique rolls. An assortment of rice, noodle, curry, stir fry and Korean dishes were also offered.

The presentation was unique with Sashini being served in LED blue light lit glass bowls on shaved ice. That being said, the food was bland and average at best. Spicy rolls had almost no spiciness, the sushi rice didn't seem seasoned and overall everything was bland. Even the Sashimi which was served on shaved ice wasn't as cold or fresh as most places. It's too bad because service, decor, presentation and ordering method were spot on. Even the price was reasonable at $25/pp. There are much better options out there for AYCE Sushi."}
{"text":"Amazing place! 

Note: I didn't try out the AYCE but the iPad ordering service is quite impressive - reminds me of 168.

The place is really nice and modern. I love the clean, crisp atmosphere. Very ambient but in a bright sorta way. Colour scheme here is white.

The service was pretty good. When I went, it was a pretty busy Friday evening. Our server was extremely nice and prompt. 

To the good stuff: 
Miso soup and salad were included. The usual stuff. Salad dressing was good. 

I ordered the sashimi appetizer and the red dragon roll as a light dinner. My friend ordered the bento box sorta thing. *It is a HUGE portion as she couldn't finish it - neither could I. Very filling!*

The sashimi appetizer surprised the heck out of me. Presentation is wonderful. I like how the sashimi is laid on a bed of ice. Over the top but it made the \"wow\" factor for me. The sashimi pieces are pretty big here - it reminds me of what my friend tells me about how big the portions are in Vancouver. Everything tasted so fresh! No \"strange\" fishy taste from any of the sashimi. 

The red dragon roll was very good as well. I managed to finish the entire roll (usually I can't). Not because it was tiny, heck no. It was really tasty! 

I'll be sure to come back and try the AYCE."}
{"text":"They have all you can eat sushi lunch $14.99 - $16.99 for dinner ......very large menu and you order for the table on their menu iPad. Very efficient and fun. Today I opted for the regular lunch menu  because they don't have sashimi on the all you can eat lunch menu ?? Odd 
The place is very large seats maybe 200 people - cool decor  I'm going to say modern Japanese with a cherry blossom theme. 
Anyhoo.....nice jasmine tea in a pot is leaf at your table while you review the very large menu (I already said that) 
Server explained how everything works very well and all the servers were quick and accurate on what you  ordered - can't wait to return and use the iPads for ordering with a group of people. 
The food itself: 
I ordered Salmon & Tuna Sashimi and a Las Vegas Roll. Sashimi was nice a fresh. The Las Vegas roll was ok (I should've read the description better as I didn't realize it was deep-fried). 
The ginger and wasabi came on a little dish and both were \"old\" looking. A dry film on the wasabi - didn't ask for a replacement as by that time the restaurant was pretty busy. 
All in all I will be back !!"}
{"text":"I've got a chance to try out this restaurant tonight.  I was surprised that it's pretty full as it's not located at a very popular location; only tugged at the back corner in Heartland area, right beside Made in Japan Teriyaki.  

The decor was clean, modern and service was prompt and friendly. Every table was given an iPad to order food. You can order each dish by piece, so no food would be wasted as you would know how much you have ordered. Each dish came out very quickly so there's no point to order a large quantity at once anyway.

In terms of food quality, I can only say it's average ~ very average I mean. Selections for sashimi & sushi were very limited. On the other hand, the fish was very fresh.  Cooked dishes had far more choices (Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Korean). I personally enjoyed the curried beef dish and tum yum soup. Many other dishes were quite bland. Interestingly there were quite a few dessert choices. I liked the deep fried banana, and deep fried milk custard.

The price is only the pricey side ($24.99 for adult on weekends; $19.99 for seniors)  I would say Prince sushi or Spoon & Fork have better food quality than Heart, but the iPad menu definitely won the novelty category.

Decor: 4 (1 goes to iPad ordering menu and its efficiency)
Service: 3.5
Food: 3
Price: 3"}
{"text":"Headline:  Someone to take the throne away from Prince? Read on to find out (or just skip to bottom) :-)

So after careful consideration, I finally decided to try this place after the demise of AYCE Sushi in Square One, the discontinuation of AYCE at Spring Rolls and the bad service at 168 and the weird decision of Prince not to open for lunch on weekends (weird - as they could get so much business from this)/  

Summary of likes: iPad menu with pictures of everything, fresh fish, curry is good, decent decor.  Decent service, huge menu (Thai, Japanese, Korean, Chinese).  The food quality doesn't feel \"heavy\", which is great for AYCE.

Summary of dislikes: A bit too much rice on the sushi, but not unexpected for an AYCE place. Slightly expensive for weekend lunch $16.99 - I was expected around $15.99.  Normal weekday lunch price is $14.99, which is on par.  

Food order:
APPS
Miso soup - very good. Not excessively salty.
Kimchi salad - Had good overall taste, not spicy, but seemed a bit too refrigerated.  
Flying Fish egg salad - cucumbers, fish eggs and mayo.  I've never seen this before, but it was very tasty.  
Crispy tofu - nicely fried but bland.

ENTREE'S/MAINS
Sushi - Had salmon, mackerel, tuna, eel, snapper, tobiko.  All the sashimi was very fresh. fresh but excessive rice. It was still very good though.  Expected for an AYCE joint.  Only thing I didn't like was the flying fish roe (tobiko).
Atlantic Salmon - very fresh, but bland. Didn't feel like teriyaki taste but more just lemon zest infused.  
Red curry tofu - OMG! this was the friggin best curry I've had at an AYCE joint.  The curry had a nice thickness to it and was definitely handmade like the menu says.
Pad Thai  - not authentic but not ketchupy like spring rolls. Nice sweet egg flavour to it.  I also think it didn't have MSG in it, which is great.
Green dynamite roll - wow so good - I think they topped it off with some type of mango puree or something.
Golden California roll - meh, it's alright, but I'd skip it.


Dessert:
Red bean and green tea Ice cream - melts in your mouth.  Very nice
Mango pudding - it's alright. Nothing special

Verdict: It looks like Prince finally has a worthy competitor in Mississauga.  Definitely worth a try - so 4.5/5

{"text":"I went there for the first time... Personally the service was really bad. No server came and asked if the food was good, all they did was throw food on our table. I ordered on the I pad which was innovative and cool.  They didn't bring out the food in correct order.  This was the first place where I had the miso soup brought out after the rolls.  Also a lot of the rolls and sushi didn't taste fresh.  I really liked the Vegas roll and their salmon chips.  Everything else was definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"This review is for their AYCE sushi.

My uncle treated my entire family out when we visited from Orange County.  I was immediately impressed by their cool menu concept.  I have seen tablets where you can order yourself but never for an AYCE place.  It makes it much easier because the chef can get your order in quicker and the waitresses just brings out the items fast.  It was also nice because our party was eight people and they gave us two tablets to order off of.  The menu was organize and easy to find what you wanted.  There was a huge variety and all the sushi was pretty fresh and tasty.  There were also a lot of non-sushi items as well, such as udon, and meats on sticks.  There were a few of us that didn't eat raw fish and they ended up also enjoying themselves and loving the food as well.  We ended our dinner with lots of complementary ice cream.  Overall we had a great dinner and would be back."}
{"text":"Modern atmosphere but food is lacking. Rolls were bland and fell apart. They also forgot the spice in my spicy tuna. Not impressed. Service was slow and waitress was exceptionally ... unfriendly."}
{"text":"Do NOT go there. I had a mini gathering with my friends and they wanted to eat there for dinner so that's the only reason I went. The grilled eggplant was drenched in oil and the surf clams were definitely NOT fresh. The raw scallops were not the usual big ones where you slice into thin pieces at sushi restaurants but they gave us tiny ones where people usually use to cook with. Those were not fresh either. Guess what? Within an hour, I went to their bathroom because I had to puke. My body literally physically rejected the food. NEVER AGAINNNNNNN."}
{"text":"I don't think I'll ever be back here again. I used to come here often, not anymore!! Upon arrival, I was notified that there would be a $2 surcharge on AYCE because of the holidays. So instead of 16.99, it was 18.99 for lunch. 

As we sat down, I noticed that the tables are not cleaned properly at all. There's still clear/white residue left from previous tables, so management and staff are not actually wiping the tables down with sanitizer or soap, but simply just using a dry cloth? Idk. It's gross. I told my friend about this later that evening and said she had the exact same experience, except when she told the server about the table, they were reluctant to clean it. Anyway, I was turned off from that point onwards. I ordered a sweet and sour soup and the bowl came to me with sweet and sour soup on the sides of the bowl, so basically dirty and not handled with care. The sushi itself is lacking quality and not nearly as good as it used to be. Plus the wait was unbearable. We ordered on the iPad and waited at least 15-20 minutes for the soup to come. I get that it was the holidays and they were pretty busy, but I'm sure they're not making fresh, made-to-order bowls of sweet and sour soup considering how the rest of the establishment works. 

This place actually used to be decent. Not sure what happened but it's a disaster now. Service is terrible too. Go to the OG location in Heartland instead!"}
{"text":"Came here along with some friends for lunch during winter break ....didn't know that they had special holiday pricing, but since we were really hungry, we decided to stay. 
Service was otherwise really good, but they messed up with the order one of our friends, who was vegetarian and who had specifically ordered certain items for himself...wasn't very happy.
Sushi rolls were generally good. Fried rice, tempura shrimp, general tao chicken, all hot and fresh
Dumplings were amazing.
some of the crab meat rolls were disappointing - bland, and strange texture.
Since this was the first time that some of us were going to a AYCE, we were definitely surprised by the amount of food we ended up accumulating and at the end, we literally counted down almost 16 sushi pieces that we forced ourselves to eat...strange experience, but I would say definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great evening with friends! The food comes out fast and fresh! Lovely ambience.... Love the new technology of iPad orders..... I just wish they brought the food to your table inorder of course instead of all at once or sushi before the soup....."}
{"text":"4.5

the salmon sashimi was incredibly fresh it was served  over ice.  great presentation.  the food quality was pretty good.  some food was okay but for the most part great selection.  price wise the beer was expensive but overall would come back.
general manager was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"It was a quiet Monday night, the service was slow but waiters seemed confused. My waiter got our order wrong a few times and forced us to have the order from another table because she gave them ours by mistake. The selection was minimal, not as good as the Britannia location, very steep collection of food like usually stuff you would find at any AYCE sushi. The food quality is that the Chinese food and Korean food was too oily; the tempura was fried to death with a burnt brown tinge-tasted like old oil, octopus that was grilled was chewy, the sashimi tasted a bit off- it was also lukewarm, and don't get me started on the rock hard skewers that were very dry. I wonder if I tried their regular menu would it be better. Almost 32.00 with tip doesn't seem good for mediocre food."}
{"text":"Good enough for an all you can eat.   Slow service (ordering tempura is impossible).  Pricing is on par with other similar places.   Today, I received a long hair wound though my hand roll.  Not sure how they missed it as it was sticking about an inch out of the bottom.  I asked the waitress to tell the manger - which resulted in a lame 10% off my meal.  It's the first time it's happened to me here (we've been about 4 other times) but I would expect to be compensated for my meal.  
It's not that great to deal with hair in the food and below standard service."}
{"text":"Party of 3 on a wednesday night. Decor is modern and trendy. Good crowd on a weekday. First sushi restaurant in sauga to use self administered Ipads! :D 

pro: sashimi was fresh, wish they didn't serve it over ice though. Rolls were good. I wonder how the quality will be after a couple of weeks. 

con: They don't have their liquor license yet so if you enjoy drinks with your meal then go in two weeks! though i don't know why they have weekly drink deals on their menu already...Also, I know they're trying to be innovative but they have this menu item (forgot what it was called) that literally had julienne cucumbers with sauce on a pringle...LOL and it did not taste right D:

but what I didn't' get was that the bill came out to $28 excluding tips on a weekday night. I guess there's not enough competition in Mississauga. For convenience and quality of AYCE sushi I might consider going back again but I rather make the trip to Scarborough for cheaper and better quality sushi."}
{"text":"Very cute and clean interior, affordable, the quality of the food has never disappointed me, love the iPad ordering service, and the food arrives fairly quick. In the booths, the table is fairly high but I get over it after I start eating. Sometimes the servers are way too busy where if you needed them, you'd have to be patient. Great location for pre-shopping or after. Would recommend to anyone in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Best AYCE sushi in Mississauga. Sushi quality is respectable for an AYCE place, service is fast, not always the nicest, but it's fast, which is all that matters. Fried stuff can sometimes be a bit stale, like the sushi pizzas , but they are improving this."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.I'm giving away this place 2 stars just because their service was remarkable and the iPad ordering was quick and accurate apart from that this  place has nothing to offer and I say so because when you go to a restaurant and if the food doesn't taste good then everything else becomes secondary rather meaningless.

Everything ordered from the menu which included the sushi, hand rolls, soup, calamari, pad thai, red curry, fried rice and few other items lacked flavor and freshness.The salmon used was of low quality and had a smell to it which is a big put off at a sushi place.

The only few items I enjoyed were shrimp tempura, coconut ice cream and fried banana all three were on point!

The ambience is quite welcoming, bright and the place is decently done for an AYCE joint.I don't myself coming back because the food didn't really excite my tastebuds."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Have to pay to change to something cheaper. Servers dont even know how to speak english."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Come here (Bristol) if you are not sure which one to choose between the Britannia location or the Bristol location. Much better in many ways.

Came here today at 5PM to try their dinner experience, as I have been to the Britannia location for lunch. This time, I want to compare the dinner experience with the lunch... 2 words: MUCH BETTER!

Since we came in for 5PM, it wasn't so busy, but even as I see the restaurant getting busier and busier with more customers as dinner time is approaching, the service and the speed of food coming did not change a bit.

As far as food, both locations food taste the same, and it is pretty good food for AYCE, but this Bristol location is the better of the two because of one thing, and this is huge for me as a customer: SERVICE.

The whole time, I know who our designated server is. There were many occasions that she will check if we need anything, and if our drinks needed refilling.
I had the complete opposite experience with their Heartland location.

I love how the sushi is presented as well, they come with ice and LED color-changing bulbs at the bottom of the plate / bowl. Very fancy!

I like this location better when it comes to desserts. All items can be put through the iPad and you don't have to wave down a server to place your order for desserts. This way, I can order so much more without feeling bad for telling a server I want 10 orders of mango ice cream haha.

Food comes fast, no forgotten orders, great ambiance, oh, and also this location is so much more organized, as there are always staff around to take care of greeting customers, seating customers, etc. Staff is always available and very attentive to our needs.

This experience made everything right, and this guarantees another visit to to Heart Sushi Bristol for sure.

{"text":"TL;DR: One impatient server who threw the bill on the table in front of me, which ruined my Mother's birthday celebration. Thank you Heart Sushi for such a negative experience!

This is my first time here, and will be my last. It's funny how such a nice experience (it was my Mother's birthday btw) with this place will be ruined by a very rude server! Never coming back!

We had a reservation today for 7 people at 12:30 PM lunch, but there were only 6 of us who were there eating until about 1:30, as the last person in our party unexpectedly arrived late.

When the 6 of us were eating, it was a pleasant experience, I will be honest. Food comes really fast, there were no forgotten orders, food was so-so (well, what do you expect from AYCE??). I assumed orders came fast because they were not so busy at the time.

2PM came, and by then we were at the restaurant for an hour and a half, and I noticed that one server kept coming back to check on us, and finally asked us, \"Are you waiting for anything? Dessert?\".... At that moment, no, we were not ready for desserts yet, as we were just enjoying our nice lunch, and would appreciate if she will not come back to bug us again. So I answered, \"No, we were only waiting for one last BBQ item. Thank you. No desserts yet\"

But 5 minutes passed, and she came back again, asking now what would we want for desserts, with a piece of paper and a pen ready to take orders, when WE DID NOT ASK to order desserts yet... I'm like what the ---, this server has gone from being nice to being rude, just like that, as soon as we were in the restaurant for more than an hour and a half!

So we were forced to get our dessert orders, and she made it a point to deliver it to us, as soon as the desserts were ready. So while we were eating dessert, the last BBQ item that we ordered from their menu finally came. At that time, we had all lost interest in the last forgotten item, and the experience was ruined terribly anyway.

So it went pretty much downhill from there, the server might as well watch us eat our dessert, as within a couple minutes she came back with the bill AND the machine (wow this girl just won't leave us alone to eat!).

This part almost made me snap at her, as she THREW the little tray with the bill on the table. She read the amount on the bill, then threw the bill on the table, in front of me.. I was close to complaining and asking to speak to a manager right there, but at that point, I was just really tired, and decided to just pay the bill, and leave zero tip.. and promised to never step foot in Heart Sushi Britannia ever again!

This place DESPERATELY NEEDS training with their servers, on how to treat their customers right.




Review 9 of 100"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch in a group of 7. The food was mediocre, I've had better sushi in north york. It is a little on the pricey side and the service was not great, they seemed understaffed as the greeter was also cleaning and waiting tables. 

You place your order on an iPad which is a nice plus. 

My main issue was the fact that we ordered 5 miso soups and only received 1, which was followed by all our sushi. We were hard pressed to tell someone as there was nobody that came to check in on us. Finally after we had finished our sushi we asked the waitress and it was clear they had forgotten. They double checked our order and said it would be out shortly. It took another 15 min and asking another waitress about it before we finally received it. 

My second issue was the fact that 5 out of 7 people in our group were vegetarian. We found fish eggs on our vegetarian sushi. 


I brought these issues up with the manager and although it was dealt with in the end, I received very condescending and argumentative responses. For one, I was told that some Asians consider soup an item to be had at the end of the meal. Maybe this is true but every sushi place I've been to it's considered an appetizer. Second I was told that the fish eggs are supposed to be there, and that \"vegetarian\" at their restaurant does not include no fish, that it includes only no beef and chicken. 


In the end although the issue was dealt with, overall the service was subpar and I did not walk out a happy customer. 


Would I return? Probably not given the numerous other sushi places in north york."}
{"text":"The food quality is 5/5, the service and easy to use iPad menu is 5/5. The price is 4/5. 

Went here for a lunch and had about 8 different items. All were very fresh. The rice and fish tasted amazing. 

The only downside for me is price. It was about $18-19 for lunch per person inc tax and I know of other really good quality places in the GTA for $15. 

Service was very quick and asked many times if we wanted anything else."}
{"text":"Not sure what all the hype is about. To me an average sushi shop trying to be hip. More effort is needed on the quality. 
The food was average and over priced for the serving size. 
When they say that they close at 10pm it means they stop serving at 9:15pm and start breaking down the restaurant. 
Do yourself a favor and try anything else."}
{"text":"I had very high hopes for this restaurant after reading the amazing reviews, and we were left disappointed. We wished we had gone to our regular AYCE sushi place instead of here.

First impressions: 
-Very clean dining area
-Modern decor
-Nice hostess
-iPad ordering system
-Not very busy

So far so good right? Next we get seated, alllll the way next to the kitchen. There's another connecting dining room where we can see all of the other staff sleeping in the booths and hanging out. Didn't think too much of it but weird to hear alarms going off because they're sleeping. They didn't have a lot in selection - strangely since usually restaurants have mackeral sashimi. Their white tuna is listed as Escolar which is the actual name of 'butterfish'. I ordered 'Popcorn Chicken' which came out to us as Chicken nuggets. How disappointing. We asked one of the staff for sauce and she basically ignored us. The other staff saw we needed water refilled and ignored it. We also had to order desserts with the staff - not on the iPad. What really ticked us off was while we were getting our desserts the staff gave us the receipt as if to say 'you can go now' or 'hurry up and leave' to us without us asking for the bill or asking if we wanted more desserts. 

Nope. That's a big no no in our books. So we gave you guys a try and won't be back. Also maybe give your staff members an actual staff room/space for them to sleep all they want and talk as loud as they want."}
{"text":"one of the most expensive sushi restaurants i have been to, and I have been to many, just look at my past reviews. I am ok with paying $30+ for AYCE, but only if the food warrants. This place does not. Waste of money. All this place has to offer was nice decor, and that says a lot."}
{"text":"All-you-can-eat place. Lunch price is low, and I would say the price correctly reflected on the quality."}
{"text":"The sushi definitely exceeded my expectations! I will be returning 100%. The iPad system is great, they even give you a little stand for them which I thought was cute. The presentation of the food was also great."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend, with no intention of getting ayce... I was planning to get a bento box but bento boxes were just as expensive as ayce! The ones I saw were $18 and $20. We decided to just get ayce for lunch.

The sushi was pretty good, the salmon itself was cut in large pieces. I also don't have any complaints about the service. The other food was okay, typical ayce quality. The avocado salad had 1 thin slice of avocado lol. If you want ayce sushi then this place is fine, it measures up to other ayce places imo. Though next time I'd rather eat at the food court and save myself some money considering I don't eat that much."}
{"text":"After falling in love with Heartland Heart sushi's lunch, my S/O and I decided to give this a try after finding out that it was opening up where Tako sushi used to be (She lives really close to this area and saw the coming soon posters and have been keeping close watch ever since!)

First thing they ask us is are we here for ayce, a la carte, or teppanyaki.  We went for ayce, but was surprised that they kept the old restaurant's style alive.  That'll be something to try out later on for sure!

The plates - just like their parent restaurant - are very nice looking.  Cute even. 

As for the food, it was...okay.  I liked the salmon dishes at the heartland location a lot better. It looks like they've gone back to the stock fish supplier that every sushi ayce seems to use (168, saki, etc.). Even the salmon roses seems to be skimpy compared to their other location. I'll have to try the dinner/teppanyaki before we make a full review, but if it's anything like the heartland location, I'm not too sure I'll like it. A lot of the kitchen items were similarly cooked to their primary location; very good.  One thing that really threw us off however, was the kalbi. It tasted like mackerel! I think it's because they cooked it on the same side as the fish/didn't scrape off the grill after cooking, but it was really unappealing.  I'm going to assume it was just because they're still ironing out the kinks in the kitchen, but I really hope that's not a recurring thing.

The service here is quite nice.  It was dead when we arrived (hopefully it'll pick up when the word of their opening spreads), so they were more than happy to keep our waters filled, and tables clean.  I only hope the service will remain this way when it fills up.

One thing I really liked about the place was the decor.   Similar to what one of the previous reviewers said, it's very calm, very relaxing. The music was very quiet which allowed for conversation. It was very nice.

Overall, I like everything about the place except for the food. Which is bad, because at the end of the day, that's what I'm going there for. We'll give it another shot later on, maybe for dinner/teppan, but until then I'm giving this place 3 stars."}
{"text":"With this new restaurant opening up recently, I decided to give it a try! 

My first impression back in January: this place is big! with a rather small sushi bar, I hope they can keep up with the service. 

Since then, I've been there about 5 times with my girlfriend.

The food here is good! Their spicy salmon (my benchmark roll) was above expectations, both in roll and hand roll form.  Other rolls I tried were good too, but like 168 Japan buffet, some of their standard rolls were watered down by too much cucumber (i'm sure you can ask the chefs for less, so this isn't that big of a problem)

Their kitchen items are essentially what keep me coming back.  They have the best Kalbi out of all the AYCE sushi restaurants. Their chicken is cooked very nicely; not too dry, and very flavorful, especially the curry one.  They do not offer cream cheese wontons for lunch, so that was a minus for me.

Their dinner was not that much greater, however.  The difference in menu included the addition of sashimi, identical deluxe rolls to Japan buffet, and a few interesting new dinner items (muscles being one of them)

My only gripe with this restaurant is their service/food pushing.  Of the 5 times I've been here, 3 of them required me to re-order something, whether it be sushi or kitchen. As an employee at a different AYCE restaurant, I do not understand their system.  It would appear the pink-shirted people are the waiters, and the black-shirted people are the food pushers. The problem is I only see 2 waiters taking care of the entire restaurant. Because I don't actually work here, I can't say for sure; all I know is that more often than not, I've had a missing order.

All that being said, I still find this place to be my top go-to place for AYCE lunch sushi (Their dinner did not impress me very much). For a pretty decent price, you get high quality food.

A big plus for this place for maintaining a air of high quality through your delicious food, impressive interior design and lovely platting.  iPad menus are also a plus!

A minus for their service (they're still pretty new, so I'll try again after the smoke has cleared), and above-average pricing.  

Will I come back? Most definitely....for lunch."}
{"text":"I saw on Instagram that Heart Sushi had introduced blowtorched sushi as part of their AYCE menu. This reminded me of the signature offerings of KAKA up in Markham, which I've been wanting to try for a while now. Living in Mississauga, it just made sense to try Heart first.

On a Sunday at lunchtime, I was quite pleased that I was able to easily get a table for 7 in either the teppanyaki section or the AYCE section. The AYCE option was priced at $18 for weekend lunch. However, I was really disappointed to hear that the blowtorched sushi was only available on the dinner menu, which was $28 per person. Since I was the only one in my party who was willing to pay the difference, I decided to satisfy my aburi cravings another time and ordered from the standard lunch menu.

Having gone to AYCE sushi restaurants many times before, I was not expecting much in terms of quality. AYCE quality doesn't vary too much from restaurant to restaurant, but some of the items that imrpessed me were the Thai curry pork, avocado salad, deep fried milk pudding, and deep friend banana.

What really matters to me at AYCE restaurants is the service. Too often, my orders have been manipulated so that I would get the \"cheaper\" items really quickly, and the \"more expensive\" items really late, or sometimes not at all. This is extremely frustrating. Not here though - at Heart, I'm pretty sure we got everything we had ordered. It was easy to keep track, too, because we had an iPad to track our orders and not just a paper menu. The servers were attentive and responsive, and it made for a pleasant experience.

I probably won't return to Heart anytime in the near future because I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to food, but for those looking for a good AYCE option, you can do a lot worse than Heart.

Note: I think that if their aburi is decent, AYCE aburi is a steal at $28! Will have to update my review when I decide to try it."}
{"text":"This is the worst sushi restaurant ive been to. The chicken teriyaki is so dry and flavourless like cardboard. Makis were falling apart before it reached my plate and also very bland. The waitress messed up or drinks and even yawned when she took the rest of our order. Overall horrible experience and disgusting food, extremely disappointed"}
{"text":"I don't know where to begin with this. I usually eat at the Heart Sushi location in Heartland but a friend and I stumbled upon this location and decided to eat here. When we walked in it looked cute but as far as a positive review goes, that is about it. The tables smelled like they've used the same old smelly rag to clean up, the glasses were dirty and the quality of the foods sucked. Compared to the Heart Sushi in Heartland the quality of the foods especially was terrible. Some of the sushi (the same sushi I regularly order at other location) did not match the description on the menu, the quality of the sushi was extremely poor (it had a funny after taste), and the kabli (short ribs) tasted old and had a slimy texture. I didn't spend more than 15 minutes in here and I will not be returning. Overall, I give this place a 1/5 for quality, taste and for environment, I would 100% not recommend this to anybody and it still makes me mad that I spent my money here every time I drive by it. Worst all you can eat sushi I've been to."}
{"text":"I wish there were half stars as I would put this place at a 2 1/2 rather than 3.
I went to try another ayce sushi place in Mississauga and I saw that Heart Sushi was ranked #1 by insauga for ayce sushi.
It was OK. 
When I went, the sashimi was almost warm, not even cool.
The rolls were obviously made from old rice.
The service was non-existant even though it was not very busy.
The tea came out with lukewarm water.
Given my one and only experience there, I would not go back and find it hard to believe that there would be that many people who voted in Mississauga for this place to be ranked #1 ayce sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Great selection of foods and the place is nice decor. The staff are very fast to clear your tables and bring food. Make sure to put in multiple orders so the food can come and go as you order. The selection was great for sashimi and was good and fresh. The fried foods were not desire able small portions tho. The fried sweet potatoes was amazing and the desert was delicious make sure you try every single one. The B52 shot was delicious alcohol. They did not get 5 stars because the server kept 
questioning our table on why all the food scraps was not cleared like miso soup you didn't eat the seaweed inside or when just the batter of the tempura was not eaten which we thought was nothing really if your gonna ask a question make sure its legit like why you didn't finish the more expensive stuff like sashimi or sushi which we cleared everything as this takes effort to make and costs money. Where the fried food was not questionable. Good ayce place in sauga but would not venture here for this place as there is better competition out there I.e.downtown Queen sushi or in Vaughan makimono sushi...."}
{"text":"Service was good and there was one male server that kept checking up on us which was nice. Ingredients tasted fresh but the sushi option was very limited. The menu had more ramen, pad Thai/ noodle, and cooked food options. For the price we paid for lunch i don't think it was worth it."}
{"text":"it's been a while since I had ayce. I've been here many times since it opened. they reduced the rice portion in their orders and size of each order, which some might not like but it is advantageous to those that just want to eat a lot of variety of fish. 
we wanted to make a reservation for a group with a newborn infant but the person on the phone just told us to come in... resulting in waiting by the door for a while. however, we were accommodated with a quiet booth seat in the back. 
Before I had a baby I was never attentive to cleanliness as I am now. The iPads are great but looks like they're never cleaned. some are broken. at least they balanced it out with a Purell stand by the door.
still my go-to place for my sushi indulgence."}
{"text":"I went into this new AYCE sushi place quite excited with a friend on a Saturday night. Was not very impressed overall unfortunately. 

Positives: 
1. Great ambiance. Nice lighting, great Decor.
2. Friendly staff. polite and well mannered. 
3. User friendly ipads to order food. (You have to get server to confirm order by coming to the table and okaying the order however)

Negatives:
1. food was a miss. Most of the dishes ordered were mediocre at best. Don't get me wrong, one or two of the sushi rolls were quite good, but most were just meh.
2. They got the order wrong a couple of times. Forgot our dishes. We had to reorder them a few times to get what we wanted. 
3. Ran out of deserts.  They ran out of a couple of flavors of Ice cream and a few other deserts. 

Overall the place wasn't the best and not the worst AYCE Sushi place I've been to. Not worth the weekend dinner price however. 

This place will probably be great for large groups. There is a lot of variety on the menu and it might be able to satisfy a huge mix of tastes."}
{"text":"This restaurant opened recently in our neighborhood and we were looking forward to it.
We arrived we were seated and handed an ipad.
Very impersonal. 
Our server spent maybe 2 mins with us took k our order and did not show up until she brought our bill. 
We will not be going back.
Not our style.
Small portions and expensive."}
{"text":"I have to say the service is super fast. 
However, only some of sashimi are fresh. The majority of deli don't taste good. The food doesn't deserve the price."}
{"text":"Love this sushi place I've been to the heartland location about 4 times and the other one once.mdefinitely prefer the heartland location it's got great ambiance.nthe service is always very quick friendly and my green tea has always been full. Sometimes depending on how busy it is and who you are ur server is they can forget some items. They have many options- definitely recommend the salmon tataki"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I've been to this location. Tonight was tough. The server was new and struggled to keep up. He left all our dishes on our table until the very end. We finished with 22 plus dishes all over the place. It's not that much of a complaint. Next up was the food. Sushi and other hot meal plates were good except the Pad Thai, it was simply horrible. Rubbery and tasteless. The chicken curry was also terrible. Runny and cold. Since my server was slow I had to ask two other servers for drink orders. They said ok but the order never showed up. Overall we ordered 22 different items but only 20 showed up. Like I said earlier it's the 2nd time I've been there. 1st time was a great experience, 2nd was not so good. I guess it's hit and miss. I will go back again"}
{"text":"Service was super slow had to remind waiter multiple times to bring bill and remind them about few of our dishes cause they never came. Food was blah nothing special.they need more staff definitly wont go back"}
{"text":"Ok so I love AYCE as much as the next person but it can be done very well or just ok. I think for the price tag we paid I was expecting so much more. The sashimi was lacking in good choices no tuna and no white tuna at all. The cooked food was mediocre and the portions small. 

I must say though the service was good but I chalk that up to the fact that it wasn't really service as much as it was delivering the food I ordered for myself without the need to a waiter. 

For me good service is great! But food taste and quality is better! I'm not saying the quality is bad I'm saying for the price tag it could be better. At 27.99 I'm expecting marvellous things like at spoon and fork or JJ or some of the other good AYCE places. I think since they just opened things will adapt. I sure hope so because if not I fear they will end up like Tako Sushi and disappear. 

All the best to them and I will have to return to see if things get better."}
{"text":"Love the weekend/ holiday all you can eat menu! It has far more selection than the Monday to Thursday menu - more rolls, more fish, more seafood (i.e. scallops), etc. I had always loved this place and thought to bring my boyfriend here a week or two ago. He found the food selection to be quite enjoyable and loooved the satay chicken and beef skewers as well as the rolls and some of the hot foods! I really also like how the sashimi is served on a bed of ice! Makes them taste so much more fresh! Wish they had more selection of sashimi though like other all you can eat places for dinner (i.e. makeral sashimi). Also they are more on the pricier side of all you can eat places."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant a lot and have gone a couple times for AYCE.

The ambiance to the restaurant is very good, with a nice minimalist theme. It's clean and despite the small looking exterior, the inside feels spacious. The iPad menus are very convenient and easy to use. Plus, they're fun.

The food all tasted fresh and delicious and it all had nice presentation. I only tried a bit of the non-sushi food, but it was good. The sushi was well made and yummy and I ate way more than I should have! My biggest complaint, and what's stopping me from giving 5 stars, is that I really wish there was more variety. There are many rolls, but much less sushi and sashimi. Most of the rolls are made with salmon, and I wish there were more types of fish offered.

Costumer service is okay, not great. The servers are rushed (understandable), but they aren't rude. I was put off by the fact that even though they don't close until 10, they had their last call for food at only 9:20. By 9:20 they had taken away our iPad menus, which in my opinion was much too early.

Other than that, I enjoy going to this restaurant and will probably be back again."}
{"text":"When they first opened it was very impressive. 
Then we decided to go a few weeks ago and we were not happy at all.
We are a family of four=$100.00 night out for dinner, we expect a decent meal. 
When I picked up a piece of chicken with my chopstick there was another piece of chicken floating an inch below it. 
My kids thought that I was performing a magic trick, and were very impressed. I was not, It was a long piece of hair attached to the fried chicken that was holding another piece in the air. 
When I brought it to the attention of the server, she joyfully brought me two sugar filled smoothies that i neither ordered nor wanted.
That was their compensation, and the manager stated \"it happens\" and brought us our bill. 
It's too bad, this was my favourite place for a while however the hair, and the way they dealt with it is enough for me not to go back."}
{"text":"Loved the food. Lots of parking. Clean and classy place to eat. iPad ordering. All you can eat."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the original location. Have not been in some time so decided to check out the new location with family. 4 adults with 3 little kids. I never been to Tako, but the first thing I noticed once inside was it was a lot bigger than looking from the outside. Looks very nice and clean. It was almost empty when we first got there, but eventually it filled up fast and even had people waiting.

Overall, the food was good.  Seems most of the servers that came to the table whispers, when they did speak.  After our drink arrived, not once did anyone come to the table and offered/asked for refills.  Very disappointed.  Even after I knocked mine over moving  the dishes down the table. I had to do that because they seemed to serve the food at the end of the table, instead of in the middle.  Little things relating to the service can definitely be better, but overall it was pretty good.  I would return to see if any improvements have been made."}
{"text":"Came here for the 2nd time the other night for dinner with family.  I like this place, and with the ipad ordering, I think it makes things go much smoother.  I don't think we had any issues with them missing anything, even when the first time was super busy at lunch.  Don't think there is many good AYCE sushi places out here, so this is definitely the place we would be going to if we wanted AYCE sushi.  

They do not add on so much rice with the sushis so you get full off them, like many places does.  Service is good.  Price is reasonable.  Only funny thing is, both times we went and ordered dessert, it takes very long to get it.  First time we went, we waited and thought they forgot about it so we ordered ice cream.  Once we finished the ice cream and started to leave, that is when the dessert came.  This time was like that too.  

But other than that, very good, clean place.  Doesn't take too long to get the food either, some items are very fast.  Just be careful to ready exactly how many pieces you get in your items, don't just go by the pictures."}
{"text":"Heart sushi is my husband's fav sushi all you can eat in Mississauga. We come here once in a while when we crave for sushi. We were there last night with three other friends and we enjoyed the food. We had a pretty good time. 

The food was yummy/good, I like the varieties, and the services were not bad. 

The reason I gave 3 stars was because the floor was pretty dirty. It was a very busy night however I would appreciate more if they can sweep the floor before letting the next guests come. The floor was full of cookies, food, dirty napkins...etc I didnt feel comfortable sitting there."}
{"text":"The food there was so great, I didn't want to stop eating haha! Service wasn't outstanding, but it wasn't bad either. For dessert, I personally think the ice cream felt like just plain store bought ice cream. When my group of 4 and I had paid, the worker was pretty disorganized on who's change was whose. Although the service was eh, it was the food that made me happy. Heart Sushi is a nice place to eat and catch up  with friends!"}
{"text":"The service is terrible and the food are not eatable compared to other sushi place. I would have to say, they did a good advisement on yelp and excellent photo"}
{"text":"We drove 30 minutes to meet a few friends at Heart Sushi for dinner; upon arrival, we were starving, and very excited for dinner. We had to choose between AYCE and à la carte ( a table can't have both).. we chose à la carte. 

It didn't take long for our server to come ask for our order and also give us recommendations! 

We chose the Maki Set #2, the Pink Lady roll, and the Kalbi Beef meal. I was blown away by the freshness of the fish, and the flavour of the kalbi beef. Our server was amazing too! Efficient and quick, something I really appreciate at large restaurants. 

10/10 would come here again, for sure."}
{"text":"I was so excited to go here with my boyfriend after reading all the yelp reviews and I'm such a fan of AYCE sushi. This place was good... but kind of disappointing. 

The restaurant has a great ambiance and feel to it. It's huge and the layout if open. It's definitely a place for a large group of people and you order through an iPad like Spring Sushi which should make it a quick an easy process.

The downside of my experience was that more than 5 of our orders were forgotten, and the food on the iPad looks much more appetizing than the food itself. I think I gotten a sashimi thing that looked like it was going to be on a taco, but unfortunately it was clearly just placed on a pringles chip. -.- The worst part was that you can completely taste the sour cream and onion flavor which made it more obvious it was a pringles chip...


The glowing thing is white tuna sashimi which was quite a nice change from other AYCE sushi places, but a bit too tacky. 

They do have a whole variety of rolls including some in rice paper instead of rice! I mean what other place has that? It's so cool!

I would come here again if I was craving AYCE sushi in Mississauga. :)"}
{"text":"The sashimi is relatively fresh and the salmon had a good deep krill colour. All the sushi rolls tasted terrible or were rolled terribly. Avoid anything that involved minced fish as it's not fresh. Avoid any roll with shrimp tempura as it tastes like rubber. The grill scallop, shrimp, and mussels were tasty. The dessert selection is good for dinner. However, don't let the wait staff order for you, otherwise he will try to order extra things that you don't want. 

They don't accept debit card and if you're eating at a promotional price they won't accept credit card which is annoying. 

Honestly, AYCE sushi in the GTA is generally a waste money and not authentic at all. I want to enjoy my dinner, not strategize how to get the most bang for my buck."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrible. I am a very fair person and i have been here two times in total, the first time was 2 years ago and i left unsatisfied at the quality of the food. I went there last night with my girlfriend and her little sister. food came fast but we ordered some scallop sashimi that came in some martini stemless glass. I looked at it to find some sort of nasty splatter marks all over it as if it was kept under the sink and got splashed while the dishes got washed as they waited to be served to customers that ordered it. my girlfriend works public health and her seeing this made her real uncomfortable. The nigiri fell apart before i could even dip it into my soy sauce, the tempura was soggy and the rolls were just dull tasting and had no flavour, the bbq eel was also very bad tasting. I eat sushi about 10-15 times a year so my body is very used to sashimi and any raw fish, I am currently at work feeling very sick. over priced at $94 for three people, awful food, the music playing was uncensored also which was a big no no. if i could rate this place .1 of a star i would. People stay away from this place. Go to 168 sushi instead this place is garbage. We left last night with a table full of uneaten rolls and only ate ice cream. I was disgusted to the max.  if you rate this place anything over 1 star then you arent eating at the right places.


this place sucked so bad i had to make a account to write a review lets just put it that way."}
{"text":"My favourite AYCE sushi place at the moment. I have eaten here for lunch many times and the food has always been great. The place can get quite busy but the service has been efficient for me every time I've gone. Highly recommend this place to all sushi lovers."}
{"text":"Update:  they dropped the free refills on their already watery fountain pop, so I drop a star.  

This place seems very polarizing, people either love it or hate it.  Often the haters hate it for the simple fact that it's AYCE, and therefore must be inferior quality.

But I can honestly say me and the Mrs. have had some good experiences here

The place is immaculate, clean, modern, but NO LONGER has free refills.

Items are ordered by iPad with descriptions so you know exactly what you're getting

Very few items, if any, were considered complete misses.  Although I guess we don't order extremely adventurously

Our favorites:  Coconut shrimp (awesome!), tempura shrimp, tempura broccoli, dynamite rolls, yam rolls, shrimp sushi, salmon rose..  I know I'm forgetting a bunch, but you get the idea, all the usual suspects.  Typical choices but they were done well

Our pick for best in the area.  Hopefully they keep up the standards"}
{"text":"Stick to the Japanese food.

First impression. WOW, the place was huge, loved the modern and wide open concept, the bar to the right of the entrance adds a nice touch. The mouthwash in the restrooms made me laugh, b/c apparently you get bad breath after eating sushi. iPad menu ordering, nice touch b/c you can see what the dish looks like, but how many people touch that iPad throughout the day, better yet picture somebody licking their fingers and then touching that iPad to order items. I hope they sanitize every single iPad after every use. 

They have a wide variety of items from, Korean, Thai, and of course Japanese, I recommend you stick with the Japanese food it is called Heart Sushi. The sushi is good, I like the fact there is a thin layer of rice on the maki rolls, the seaweed on all the rolls was very crispy and fresh. The presentation of the sashimi in a ice bowl was a nice touch and the taste of cold sashimi was very refreshing. There wasn't one item on the menu though that made me want more and for that I will only come back if I get invited.

Items to definitely get.....
- Japanese food"}
{"text":"I am a regular customer of their Mississauga restaurants and tried the Fairview Mall location today. I tried the dinner menu. I liked the food slightly more than in Mississauga. The sauces on the torched sushi and pressed sushi were better than in Mississauga. I also enjoyed the salmon tataki and the beef tataki. The kitchen items were as expected. A couple of the desert items that I tried impressed me. I loved the capuchino ice cream. 

The interior design is first rate. The general colour scheme is gold. Nice light fixtures and mirrors on two walls. The window seats were popular. There is also outdoor patio seating."}
{"text":"My dining experience was decent enough. Food was good, waiters were mediocre. They did this really annoying this where they just drop all the food on one end of the table. And with a table for 6 people we had to pass down all the miso soups, all the salad, all the glasses of water down the line.. that was annoying but okay I get it, you're busy and the tables are tightly packed together so you're trying to save time.  

They also stood so close behind me when dropping stuff off at our table that their tray kept hitting the back of my head...

Anyways the reason for my low star rating was our experience while paying. We have a $150 Visa gift card and they refused to take it. And it wasn't the fact that they didn't take it that really pissed me off (though it did bother me), it was ho they chose to go about explaining it to us. We talked to our waitress, the manager and some random that popped out of the kitchen and vs. explaining to us why and apologizing, they spent most of their timing just telling us straight up no without much further explanation. This was unfortunately as in the past we've enjoyed eating here even with the mediocre customer service.. however after last night's incident and being yelled at and then dismissed by their management without so much as apology we won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place have a good value for all you can eat restaurant. You can order whatever you want from their iPad menu with pictures of the food on it, which is great. The service is good. Tea is free. They have salmon sushi, fusion rolls sushi, soups, kalbi, Thai curry, salads, and desserts."}
{"text":"Bathroom was terrible, very dirty. Didn't see until I left, should have checked first.

Disinterested wait staff, couldn't be bothered to bring a glass for the pop.  When delivering food to the table, they were barely able to push the plate onto the edge of the table, lest they had to take one more step towards the customer. They just kinda pushed the plate almost into the table, and walked away. Leaving us to position the food between us.

No tea offered. Probably would have tasted like the miso...

The miso tasted like it had a chemical overtone, was included free in all you eat, but was still overpriced at zero cost.  It was like dishwater, but not quite as flavourful. 

The sushi wasn't cold. The salmon was served at room temp, making us wonder if it had been properly refrigerated before serving it.  The plate with eel had a hair clearly sitting on it... my wife was not amused.

I wouldn't suggest this place even though it had many reviews from young diners. Mostly 20 year olds with a palate from McDs, so what could they know?

If you want to be ignored and do all you can eat (but why would you want to?), it's a place for kids to hang. One disconnected the pump to the fountain in the corner to recharge his iPhone, so he could resume Tindering and Snapchatting with his fellow distracted table mates. 

Who needed ambiance anyway?"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner expecting it to be just as excellent as the Bristol location but boy, was it a let down. Cold food, standoffish/slow service and overall below subpar compared to the Bristol location. You'd think better of the original than its copies but certainly not in this case. Do yourselves a favour and drive over to the Bristol location instead as this was a disappointment. 

2 stars because I did like their popcorn chicken better and the blonde man serving us was a sweetheart, but rest assured that I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"One of my fav ayce sushi restaurants. 
The restaurant is decorated very nicely and the food tasted great! 
The serve was very fast because me and my friend arrived 30 mins before closing. They said to order everything right away and then pay and then we can enjoy our meal with no problems. 
The only downfall would be the servers didn't talk much and weren't well informed on what was on the menu."}
{"text":"An awful experience had dinner menu at lunch time. Bad quality food. Sashimi are not fresh. Tempura is over cooked turn to dark color and over breading. No any service. Never will come back. Curious how long they can stay in business."}
{"text":"Went last week on a Saturday night and would never go back again. This actually happened, the manger should be ashamed. We ordered a whole bunch of salmon sashimi and there was a hair in it. We told the manager and she took it back. She then brought us another order and this time it had a hair on the side of the dish. We told her again and she said \"oh it's on the side, not on the sashimi\". She did not take it back. Just disgusting. Plus the staff was very rude that night. Would never go back. WAY better all you can sushi places then this. This place should be embarrassed."}
{"text":"There's a much better heart sushi branch close by! Not the best all you can eat sushi place."}
{"text":"it's one of my favourite restaurant know I come 
All the time and it the best experience like service was fast the food come fast and it taste amazing and fresh and it's the best service ever and all the stuff where super nice and when you come in you wait 2 mins to get a table or if you planning a party you call and book and to order you use iPad touch and that's cool and the place is clean but they need to check the washroom because sometimes it's not clean like no soap and it's always all you can eat so tea and water including but other drinks you have to pay extra!

{"text":"Heart Sushi brings in fresh seafood daily to serve the best quality food for their all you can eat and teppanyaki. They have recently introduced new unique items to their menu including torched sushi. For those not looking to have AYCE, there is a separate dining area where guests can enjoy teppanyaki for lunch or dinner.

My friend and I ordered a sashimi platter consisting of Tuna, Salmon, Hamachi and Escolar. Right away we could taste the freshness of the fish which was very different from previous experiences at AYCE sushi restaurants. The sashimi was firm and delicious, and it didn't have a lingering fishy aftertaste which bad quality fish do. My favourite was the Escolar because the texture was very soft and buttery, and the fish was rich in delicious flavour.

From their teppanyaki (not a part of AYCE) we ordered shrimp, scallops, striploin and filet mignon. To be honest, I didn't have much expectations for their striploin and filet mignon because of previous teppanyaki experiences with it being overcooked, tough and dry. But after taking the first bite I was extremely surprised at how tender and juicy the meat was! The beef was soft and full of juicy flavours. The scallops and shrimp were also perfectly cooked and tasted delicious. This was a wonderful surprise seeing how they use great quality meat and seafood for their teppanyaki.

By the end of our meal we were stuffed and extremely satisfied with all the items we tasted. From their sashimi to their teppanyaki, all the food tasted very fresh and of high quality. I highly recommend Heart Sushi for their teppanyaki after tasting how tender their striploin and filet mignon were, which is why I went back again a few days later to enjoy their delicious food. If you're looking to try their seafood teppanyaki, I recommend trying their scallop and shrimp."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of colleagues for lunch, 6 of us In total. The whole experience was very frustrating.

1) First thing really frustrated us was the iPad menu: no price were shown for any item we picked. There was only 1 iPad menu, we have to wait our term to look at the menu and order food, which took forever for 6 people. There was no one take our orders neither. We have to add items to the cart and place order directly on the iPad. That's fine. However, it took forever to get our sushi. We even asked the waitress close to our table, how long gonna take to get our food. She had no idea and just said your food were be served when it's served. 

2) The next thing was the service: all waiters and waitresses acted they don't work there and confused all the time. The look on their face indicated that they were not sure which table should they bring the food to. They literally put the plates down on our table then 2 secs later picked them right up and put them to the table next to us. 

A funny observation: sometimes the way our food were dropped off was like drug drop-off (waiter/waitress looked other direction, quickly drop plates off but pretended it never happened and walked away as fast as he/she can.) 

3) Last but not least: we order Edamame as appetizer for the table. I'm pretty sure everyone's expectation when they order Edamame at restaurant is seeing them severed in a small bowl. When our Edamame was served, we were not sure if it's a joke or not - 5 pieces of Edamame in a tiny plate. Jaw dropping for sure!!!!!! When we asked for the bill, there's no breakdown items, only total. We were like: could you please bring a copy of the breakdown items, so we can see the price? The waitress was like: we don't have that, if you want to see the price, please grab a take-out menu, the prices is there. WTF?!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a big group of 20 people, the place is big so was able to easily accommodate our party. Service was excellent, and the variety of dishes was good. Wish they had chicken karaage though"}
{"text":"I've been frequenting Heart Sushi ever since they opened. Because I've been such a loyal customer, I know what their quality was like when they first started. However now, after a few years, they 100% downgraded their quality in all their AYCE options. 

Their shrimp tempura tastes like what you would expect deep fried corn starch would taste like. I've been coming here for a while and this never happened to me before. When I complained about it, they redid the tempura for me with less batter and guess what? The shrimp itself TASTED LIKE CORNSTARCH. It was the grossest thing ever. 

Their house salad and avocado salad is now horrible. It was like a soup bowl of their dressing that happened to have pieces of lettuce and carrots in it. What salad has more dressing than vegetables?!"}
{"text":"I was treated to Heart Sushi as a birthday dinner. The modern establishment is very easy on the eyes, love the decor. The staff are friendly and attentive. Easy ordering through the iPad with pictures. The food could be better but it is AYCE, usually it is not the best of the best. The plating is very nice and elegant."}
{"text":"Great place for big gatherings or intimate ones. 
The restaurants decor is very cute, it really depicts the name. 
+1 on the iPad menu! Makes ordering fun and you can always refer to pictures and a brief description of each dish. 
+1 of fast service but for some reason always slow with my onion tempura maki rolls. 
Food tastes great, but their presentation is better than most sushi buffets
Overall great restaurant"}
{"text":"Went here for the AYCE lunch. Great interior, staff were quick and the ipad ordering system is nice as everyone else is doing it. Food was good and the variety was nice. I would come back and try the AYCE dinner. Thanks Heart!"}
{"text":"#YELPGTA #HEARTSUSHI #MISSISSAUGA #AYCESUSHI

This place is such a gimmick - hearts on the ceiling, hearts on the sushi, iPad menu, the whole sha-bang, but it doesn't deliver. Also costs an extra dollar or two compared to other places. And you pay another dollar for drinks and pop (not bottomless, either). You have to pay for the gimmicks, of course!

The desserts - don't be fooled by the nice images. They come in a shot glass and taste nasty.

I went for AYCE lunch. The salmon tasted off. Everything else tasted the same. Definitely not the best sushi I've had. The service isn't great either. We waited for 30 minutes to pay the bill. Could've just walked out and I doubt a soul would've noticed. 

Don't think I am coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I have no complaints other then the service can get a bit slow. Overall one of the best sushi buffets in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Great place, great food and amazing atmosphere! highly recomended"}
{"text":"We came here as a group of 8 and were seated in the back area for groups. We came around 1:30PM so it was very busy. Service wasn't that great, had to ask numerous times any time we wanted something but if you come at an off time maybe service is better?

Food is what you would expect from most AYCE places, nothing exceptional. I would still pick New Generation in Vaughan for AYCE."}
{"text":"I usually go to the Bristol location, but today I decided to try out the heartland location- big mistake. My siblings and I chose to do a la carte and they gave us a paper menu which was tiny and grimy; soy sauce and crusty all over. They had bento boxes for 8.99(on the menu online) and we tried to get that but it was for take out only, so we decided to get a beef teriyaki bento for home. We had a few rolls that were decent but once once I got home I checked the bento box and it was sashimi instead of beef. So irritating not being able to eat the bento in the restaurant even though it's online and then coming home with the wrong food... service was terrible as well so I'd stick with the Bristol location or any other place lol"}
{"text":"Overall, a great experience. On a Sunday afternoon, with tax and tip, our meal came to $44 for two people ($16.99 per person for a weekend AYCE lunch).

When we arrived, we were promptly seated and greeted by our server, David. He explained how to use the iPad menu, and we went through and ordered our selections accordingly, at our own pace, after reading through the selections (you get quite a variety to choose from!). Food quality was surprisingly very good for AYCE. The place was also very clean, modern, and had tasteful decor. Food also arrived in a timely manner, even though it was quite busy on a Sunday afternoon. Great service.

We ordered a number of things: several varieties of hand rolls and maki rolls, kimchi salad, both types of tofu, thai chicken skewers with peanut sauce, edamame, seaweed salad, Korean beef ribs, Korean bulgogi, salmon, miso soup, shrimp and veggie tempura, among others. All were quite good - the standouts were the spicy avocado hand rolls, Korean beef ribs, and Thai skewers! For dessert, we ordered ice cream, tiramisu (single serving, comes in a shot glass), and mango pudding (also in a shot glass). These were all very delicious!

Overall, we had a great experience here, and while it's pricier during a weekend lunch, we would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"What I love about heart sushi is their sweet shrimp AYCE. I think it's the only Mississauga AYCE that has the sweet shrimp to eat at, from a AYCE perspective. Good quality overall, fresh seafood that has scallop (small ones) and octopus sashimi."}
{"text":"This place was huge and looked very modern. A little on the pricey side, but decided to check it out anyway.

To order your food, you will have an iPad to place each time and send it wirelessly to the kitchen. This resulted to less waiting time and more satisfied stomach.

The food portions were small, but order more and you should be ok. Delicious and fresh but presentation can be a little better. 

I hope the price was a little cheaper but the service and quality was good, so I'll prolly be back."}
{"text":"I'm a stickler for a good all you can eat sushi restaurant! Heart Sushi was fresh, tasty and provided prompt service. iPad menu, well lit yet intimate environment and music that doesn't distract from your company or conversation. Check, Check, Check. Will definitely be dining here again. :)"}
{"text":"Very disappointing! Been here a total of 3 times so I've given it its fair number of chances to impress me. The last time I went both food and service was lacking..not worth it for the price you pay. Even easy items on the menu went horribly wrong liKe seaweed salad (overwhelming stench of sesame oil probably to cover up its staleness) and house salad was dressed with watery thousand island sauce. Sashimi was alright but certain pieces were not thawed properly and was ice cold. Also, pictures of desserts on the menu are not even remotely close to what they look like in real life. The lychee mousse looked amazing in the photo, turned out to be a dollop of pink whip cream in a shot glass. I will never come back to this place if I'm looking for good ayce sushi."}
{"text":"Great food... Attentive server and restaurant manager... Probably the best service I've had in a while... We were super picky and asked a million questions... Very first time ever being at this restaurant since it's converted from Spring rolls... Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We go there quite frequently, since it was opened last year. 
We loved the freshness of the food, the ambiance and the service.
But over time we are seeing a fall in the quality and cleanliness. 

Still it's one of the good places for sushi lovers, good and wide choices of sushi/maki/sashimi and a nice dining environment. We really expect the quality of the food and service to get better, like the initial months when it was opened."}
{"text":"Hey folks. I'd like to rate food at this place at five stars but unfortunately service is at most three stars. The reason is when I got my bill for tip options there was 25,20,18% and other $ amount. It's not that fancy place where you can leave such big tips, don't forget this is all you can eat sushi place. Other than that good if very good, fish seems to be fresh, this place is similar to 168 sushi and I assume could be the same owner. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've mostly gone their for lunch and they're quite decent but my personal preference is to have more of the speciality sushis especially with cream cheese and lunch does not have any. I prefer only going here if it's a group gathering and their choice of location otherwise I'd prefer another place."}
{"text":"My go to AYCE sushi joint in Mississauga (hard to find ideal sushi spots when you're used to downtown Toronto restaurants I find). Sashimi is fresh, rolls are pretty decent and I do love the Pringles with cucumber and salmon."}
{"text":"Good selection of sushi, I come regularly as its in the area. They're definitely not as focused on customer service as they once were, change in ownership maybe, I don't know. Had to ask 3 different servers for spicy mayo, and was in a rush near the end asked for the bill and had to wait another 15min, was about to go grab the machine myself. Sushis always good though."}
{"text":"This was my second time there. If you're looking for sushi, definitely a good place to go! Sushi was very good. Mango salad was good. 
However, the hot food was less to be desired. The Sweet and Sour chicken was supposed to come with pineapple and veggies on it, it literally was just chicken pieces in sauce. My friend ordered the shrimp pad thai, it had one tiny piece of shrimp at the bottom. 
The service was horrendous. We walked in and the lady at the front, stayed on the phone and didn't even say hi. 
The same lady didn't want to give us two bills. Nor were they prompt to bring my change. 
All in all, if you only care about the sushi, it's great. If you want good service and good hot foods, seek another restaurant."}
{"text":"\"On You're Mark, Get Set.......GO!\"

Heart Sushi is a busy AYCE (all-you-can-eat) Japanese restaurant on Britannia Road in the Heartland area of Mississauga. As far as AYCE places go, this one is very good (although I still prefer K&B Sushi). The service is quick, the food is good and the ambiance is well.....hectic! It's more akin to a cafeteria.

Heart is divided into 2 sides; booths on one side and a combination of benches and chairs on the other side. The environment is hopping with servers bringing your order and whisking away used plates. To place your order, you scan the items on an iPad (not new in the AYCE world) and select what you want and then you \"Send Order\" and in a few minutes your food appears. You can press a button to call a wait staff.

If you're out with a group of people to slam down a ton of Japanese food in a loud chaotic (although controlled) environment, then Heart is a good place to go. The food is good, service is quick and the price (albeit two dollars highers than your average $22.99 dinner at an AYCE place) is fair at $24.99 for dinner.

If you're looking for great sushi in a more subdued and intimate space and an AYCE menu (and yes, with iPads), I think K&B Sushi is better. However I agree that Heart is one of the best AYCE sushi restaurants in the Heartland area."}
{"text":"One of the worst sushi places out there! Food is terrible, sushi tasted like it has been sitting in fridge for ages, too much rice and less fish in the rolls. Service is super slow, even the iPads cant save them! When we were there for dinner, only 4 tables were occupied in a huge restaurant and the food still came to us 45 mins later. Waste of a good location!"}
{"text":"This new AYCE sushi place is pricier than other AYCE places around Scarborough/Markham. They do have a lot of choices (they have some dim sum and some Korea dishes too) but most food items just taste mediocre. Pops are not included in the price. Service and decor are good. Sashimis are nicely served on a big bowl of ice with LED light. I would not return because it's not worth the price for food that doesn't taste good."}
{"text":"Being from the city this restaurant felt very Toronto-like. Great selection of Asian fusion AYCE, fast service and ordering on the iPad was easy. Decor was really nice as well. Would definitely make a second round here again."}
{"text":"Why I give 3 stars instead of a 4 or 5 is because I felt they were being somewhat dishonest by not mentioning that that specific weekend had a \"special price\" until we were already seated at the tables. This meant that we had to pay the more expensive dinner price even though we came during lunch. I would've appreciated being informed of this when we first came in instead of after being seated as it isn't likely that a customer would leave after waiting for half-an-hour.

The waiting area felt small and crowded but the actual tables felt more spacious. The place is modern and the variety of food was pretty good. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the octopus.

We came on a Sunday afternoon on Mother's Day so maybe that was why the wait was pretty long. Also, reservations were unavailable."}
{"text":"Best AYCE sushi in the city!

The food at Heart is absolutely delicious in everyway. Their sashimi is extremely fresh and are beautifully laid out on top of a LED lit ice bowl, and they have a wonderful selection of creative sushi options like the \"Mississauga Roll\" which is absolutely mouthwatering. My favorite dish is by far their salmon sashimi on top of a lemon wedge and red onions, the flavor and texture of it is amazing and is a much-try if you visit Heart!

The service was very fast, and our food came out minutes after we ordered. (the Ipad makes ordering super efficient). However, throughout our meal they delivered a few wrong dishes to our tables, but considering how overwhelmed I was with the yummy food this place gets nothing but 5/5."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi places. Love using the iPad to order stuff, just everything is good here. Love this place just."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really neat and clean and has a generally nice vibe. The food is not that great in terms of quality and it lacks flavour for the most part. The ordering is easy and efficient as every table receives a tablet from which the order can be placed. After we paid and we were putting on our coats another staff member asked us if we had paid before leaving. We felt that was a little unprofessional."}
{"text":"Came in on their third day and there was probably around 5 other tables here. There aren't any entrances from the mall so I think it could be quite hard for this store to get some exposure. 

In general the food was pretty decent. It reminded me alot about the other sushi buffets like kiku and 168 sushi buffet. The iPad app is literally the same so it's probably owned by the same franchise. 

The stuff that I liked: 
- Salmon belly (cooked) 
- tempura 
- katsu 
- skewers 
- hand rolls (surprisingly good) 
- desserts and ice creams 

Stuff I felt could use a bit more work
- the ramen ( not enough flavour, same with the soups) 
- sushi was decent but it's a shame there isn't tuna (the red one).... No sashimi. 
- I appreciate that the soy sauce tasted decent as well since I find many places dilute their soy sauce which really turns me off.. 
- kalbi (this is a huge issue because I absolutely love the kalbi at kiku and 168, the ones here do not offer the best cut of meat and is drenched in abit too much sauce) 
- steak (same comment as above) 
Both sushi and the meat are essential dishes to nail in order to succeed well at a sushi buffet imo.. 

Overall the service was very good. I found it funny how all of the servers are on their peak performance since it looks like both of the managers are at the restaurant training. Contrary to the comment below, I found it great that the servers came often asking how we are doing, filling up water and even explaining the dishes. It really surprised me since the level of service one would expect at a sushi buffet to be very low.... But at heart sushi the food came fast and the service was great. 

If they work on the quality of the sushi and meat I'm sure I will come by often since I work at the office close by with my coworkers. Might even consider investing in the VIP card too.."}
{"text":"Good tasty food. We liked all of the salmon dishes that came. Kalbi is tasty. Tempura is yum. Good for groups with kids.

Service is ok. Don't look at the floors. You don't always get everything you ordered and dessert might take forever to arrive. If you go with a large group, note that a lot of items are per PORTION, so you may need to order many. 

I think the adult price should afford a better service and experience. It was very busy for Sunday dinner, but they take reservations."}
{"text":"A solid 4 star AYCE sushi restaurant. 

The hot food is terrific and well made. I loved the chicken wing, the meat skewers, the steak. The raw food is fresh and delicious. The rolls are huge so be careful when ordering! The menu selection is ginormous and covers Japanese, and also other Asian items such as fried rice, pad thai, etc. Btw, pad thai is really good here!!!!! And dessert selection is satisfying. 

Restaurant is chic, spacious, and trendy. Ordering from an ipad is kind of fun. Service is fast during busy dinner service. Place gets packed so make sure you have reservations especially on weekends!"}
{"text":"Horrible quality sushi. Horrible service. Undercooked food. Got sick. Only credit/cash. Don't come here."}
{"text":"Great sushi place with wonderful service! For AYCE sushi in Mississauga, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Very good technology.  Use iPad for ordering which make it very convenient.  Food need a lot of improvement though."}
{"text":"My family and friends come here all the time. I would say, it's one of my favourite all you can eat Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been here several times with friends and family for their AYCE sushi option, as well as for their teppenyaki option. Each time I've come here, it's because some friends or family members want to go. 

That being said, there are a couple of positive things about this place:
-Variety of appetizers and dishes for all types of eaters, whether you choose the AYCE or the teppenyaki options
-Green tea is included
-Teppenyaki chefs are funny and hard working
-Portions for teppenyaki dishes are fair
-Clean overall in both areas
-Noise level is not too loud
-Plenty of parking in the plaza and good location in Mississauga, a few minutes drive away from Square One area

Cons:
-Price continues to increase for both options as time goes on, yet the quality and quantity of food doesn't justify this (ex: ayce for lunch is almost $23 with tax and tip!)
-Hit or miss in terms of taste of their sushi rolls, rice dishes and savoury dishes
-Good luck waiting for a server to come by after your initial order and bringing you what you're asking for such as refilling your tea, bringing more napkins, bringing missed items etc.

For the budget conscious, I personally feel that the AYCE sushi option is better than the teppenyaki option since you get more variety in what you eat and both options could come out to the same price depending on your order. For instance, getting a teppenyaki meat and seafood combination with the standard fried rice, salad and soup can come out to almost $30. You get a lot more with the AYCE option for that price. Teppenyaki orders can come out to less than $25 with tax and tip if you order only one meat/seafood item. Again, all depends on whether you want more bang for your buck. The teppenyaki option is also more for the experience but when you've seen this once or twice, it's not that exciting.

Basically, if you're not picky about food and service, this place is okay - especially if you want choices in what you eat. It's an average ayce place and there are better ones out there but you'll have to drive to the east end like Vaughan for those ones."}
{"text":"Went to 'I Heart Sushi' tonight with my family for the second time. The first time we came an hour before their last call so we had to order everything we can and didn't really get to enjoy it. This time around we had plenty of time and got to really take our time and enjoy each plate that came. 

Their atmosphere is very intimate in the sense like most sushi bars and AYCE places.  They have the long bar seating, along with booths which offer a more community type eating environment. They have good lighting with good decor.  Majority of the time these places are usually loud because it's more enclosed spaces. But nonetheless provides the environment it needs to for their customers to enjoy their meal.

Their sashimi and their sushi items are amazing. The freshness is there and the quality you can taste. The salmon lightly seared was fantastic, it melted in your mouth and had this amazing buttery taste to it. The handrolls were perfect tonight. Being someone who loves food and travels to places to try new things and new places, I've tried handrolls at many sushi places and they aren't always the light, crispy, easy to eat rolls. At I heart sushi, it definitely delivered.  

This place is definitely good for the freshness of the fish and the cut was great."}
{"text":"Food was good, services was below average on a Saturday night at 8:30pm. Even though we used iPads to order, most of the food served to us was incorrect and arrived at varied times.  Appetizers like Edamame and Tempura were served last. Doubtful I will return to this location."}
{"text":"Go somewhere else of the same price point and you will be happier. 
I went with my partner as we really like going to some of Hearts competitors. We decided to give this place a chance as it is close to our house. 
Immediately I could tell that they don't maintain the restaurant as well as they should, they had burnt out lights and dirty glass wall at the entrance. But I don't normally judge on things like this but on the food so we ordered. I told the server I have an allergy to seafood, hence we only ordered all chicken beef and veggie options, with the exception of a California roll for my partner. There seemed to be a lack of interest in my allergy as the California roll came on the same plate as other items which made me nervous to eat those items. 

I also noticed that they are charging the same price as the competition but using much cheaper cuts of meat. Many chicken dishes had hard bits and lots of fat still attached. I have never experienced this before at the other places. We also noted that nothing that should of been Hot (chicken ect) was actually Hot. It was as though it was prepared in advance and microwaved for a split second or just thrown under a heat lamp maybe. 

If you are planning on spending this amount of money I suggest try somewhere else of the same concept and price range."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 time and today my friends and I went for valentines day lunch. When we got there at 2 pm we though it would be lunch pricing but it wasn't. we agreed to the price and hoped to eat out worth. But half way through the experience after receiving only 1/4 of the dishes it began to slow. Half way through we sat there with no food we asked several times and only a few dishes came out. And then a manager came over and rushed us to eat dessert and i told hike about the dishes I ordered early on that never came and he agreed and left. 

overall:
-my last chance was given to them each experience has been bad. 
- we were overchanged and they were reluctant to provide good service.
-we had to wait and ask 2 people for checks which never came
- the food never really came and we paid and left
-i didn't like how they responded or lack of consideration for our problems. 

Its true the 3rd time was the charm to make me NEVER go back."}
{"text":"I love sushi, so of course I'm a fan of this place!! I just dont like that they dont serve sashimi during lunch.. what a bummer."}
{"text":"This place is simply horrible. Service is an absolute joke. They are slow, rude, and extremely racist. I don't usually go out of my way to write bad reviews, but this deserves to be publicly shamed. I visited this place for AYCE dinner during the weekend, with (my family and friends) 7 people. AWFUL. Here's a sample of the terrible experience we had:
- She dropped our food and didn't apologize and even gave us a dirty look as if it was our fault
- After she dropped the food items, it was all downhide from there. Suddenly, items we wanted to order were no longer available, yet other tables would get it. Just a joke.
- She tried to charge us for the (less than 10 pieces, across 6 or 7 dishes left, literally 1 piece on most plates). We normally don't speak chinese right off the bat, but after showing that we can speak chinese, they immediately stop the 'leftover' charges suddenly. HUGELY racist. For my english only friends, may as well avoid this place. They will try to squeeze 50cents/per piece. We've been to dozens of AYCE sushi places and know that if we leave an 'unacceptable amount' they will charge us, but this was simply ridiculous.
- They don't care about food allergies and don't even understand their own menu. We asked to have certain items held back, they nodded, and did nothing about it.

Haven't even gotten to the food review:
- Avg selection, nothing crazy, but considering the AYCE price they charge, you would expect much better selection
- Items were left sitting out or does not feel fresh at all.
- They would bring all the hot food first and save the fish or 'expensive' items till later.

For the price they charge, there are way better options out there. This place should be skipped unless you're truly desperate."}
{"text":"This sushi spot has an amazing selection of vegan options. Other than that...it's an average AYCE sushi spot."}
{"text":"An excellent amount of choices, and an amazing ordering system. The service is great and fast but some of the waitresses come across as really rude and don't like to acknowledge you, even though the owner or boss is constantly walking around being super nice and caring towards everyone. The sashimi is perfectly fresh and a lot of the dishes have a beautiful presentation. The decor is also worth the visit. I recommend this place over most places in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Lots of variety and decent quality for AYCE style. The sashimi isn't too great, but its not horrible. They have great rolls, so I recommend trying those! Their meat and grill dishes were good as well. I didn't get to try any curry or wok dishes. My first time here was enjoyable, definitely going again!"}
{"text":"Food is actually 2.5, passable, but I bumped it up because plates were cleared off efficiently and water was refilled.  Otherwise, none of the food items were really memorable.

Tastiest thing was probably the kalbi.  I did not like the salmon they used.  It's not as if it wasn't fresh, but it was a bit fishy, and I suspect not the best quality.

I've never been to the Heartland location and I don't think I'm missing much.  iPad ordering is efficient and I *think* only 1 of my items never came.  Another dessert item was unavailable.  Food does come quite quickly, so that's definitely worth mentioning!

Chicken Pad Thai - Had a kick to it, noodles were chewy, undercooked.

\"Japanese\" Fried Rice - Looks nothing like the photo.  More of a brown tinge.  Just reg fried rice to me, no difference.

Skip:  Flying Fish Egg Salad.  Meh, rather tasteless.

At $15.99 for lunch, excluding the weekends, I thought it was on the pricy side.  Not sure if soft drinks were included, but they weren't on the iPad.  Staff weren't overworked yet, so if you're curious, go during the week for lunch!  Friday/Weekends are more expensive."}
{"text":"Note:  $17.99 for AYCE lunch, Mon-Thurs.  Price does NOT include fountain drinks.  I think tea was free.

Tip:  It's -50% if it's your bday, BUT you will have to pay in CASH.

Just awh-ight for my first visit to this location.  I try to steer clear of buffets, but sometimes for bdays/social functions, it's just impossible.

The hostess was friendly and efficient, the waitress was robotic, but can't complain, everything came in a timely manner, & another waiter didn't speak English.  That's what to expect.  Restaurant was pretty full and seemed better energy than Bristol location.

Kalbi was extremely fatty (so I just ate the lean parts), grilled eggplant/zucchini was pretty greasy, so I just squeezed the oil on the side of the plate.  Everything else was pretty standard.  I didn't order the cooked foods, so I cannot comment.

Desserts you hafta order through the server...as I think that's a cue to prep your bill."}
{"text":"Had the ayce menu. The food was ok. The presentation was unique. The deep fried custard bun however, is AMAZING! It wasn't too sweet and was soft to eat. Definitely happy that I got to end my meal with it. 

The atmosphere was nice. It wasn't so busy so it was more relaxing. However; the music choice was confusing. For some reason, they were playing rock music. It wasn't that I hated the music choices, in fact, I love the songs they played; but it didn't match the restaurant setting. 

Our waiter was great. He was very kind and attentive. But he wasn't so attentive that it was annoying."}
{"text":"They're overpriced for a food thats not even that good. Overall, food is just average. There's no wow factor. Place is well decorated and service is pretty fast."}
{"text":"This place is a disaster. It replaced the spring rolls that used to be here. And to be honest I'd rather be eating spring rolls then to be eating this.

When we arrived at 11:05 in the morning, the place was empty. It opened at 11 so that was not a surprise to us. We were seated, but told that we have to wait for about 20 minutes for the food to be ready. So if food is going to be ready at around 11:30, then why don't they just open the restaurant at 11:30 instead of 11?

We ordered a bunch of stuff and they came shortly after that 20 minutes of waiting window. While we were eating we can see one of the waiters or manager cleaning the window and the tables in the back of where customers will be sitting later. He wasn't too far away from us and that really bothered me. I am eating my lunch while potentially breathing in fumes of the cleaning product, plus this is only the beginning of the day.. shouldn't they have already cleaned the place at the end of the day of the day before?

This is also the first all you can eat sushi place where they charge you $0.99 for one cup of green tea. When we ask for the wifi password  and it did not work, we asked again to confirm the password and the same guy who was cleaning the place, who also looked like the manager here, Shrugged it off and rudely told us that he does not know it might just not be working.

And how can they go wrong with ice cream. But the ice creams here are just a disaster, I'd rather buy a tub of ice cream from Walmart and go home to eat it. They were so dry and hard and not creamy at all.

The food here was not good, I would at least give it two stars for the food for trying, but the attitude of the workers here are just terrible and unacceptable. 


On the bright side the decor is nice and they have pretty chandeliers."}
{"text":"Quick summary of the positives: This place has a nice atmosphere, and I enjoyed ordering from the ipad. I also liked being served my own personal pot of green tea. The shrimp tempura was good, and the rolls weren't bad.
I went here for Sunday lunch and found it pricy, but I was more than willing to pay the $16 given the great reviews. There were many options for curries and rices, but I was here to eat sushi, and I found the selection of rolls/maki extremely limited! On the whole list there were 3 rolls that sounded interesting to me. The tempura rolls were cold through and pretty soggy, which to me indicates they weren't fresh. I also ordered squid and shrimp tempura, and as I mentioned the shrimp tempura was good, but the squid tempura was not. The batter was also completely different on the squid.. barely even what I would call tempura batter.. so I'm pretty sure they just served frozen fried calamari and did not batter it at the restaurant. I got my shrimp tempura first and my squid tempura at the end, after everything else, which I found very strange. My rolls were okay.. nothing special and nothing I'd crave or particularly recommend to anyone. I also had pad thai and I didn't enjoy it. Mostly onions, green peppers, and red peppers. The chicken had a weird texture and I wasn't used to seeing so much red onion in pad thai... On top of all that, my meal gave me very bad heart burn for the rest of the day, and I never have heartburn. And I know this sounds strange, but their soy sauce seemed somewhat flavourless to me! It was probably just low sodium but it bugged me.
Overall, I was very surprised to find this place had so many good and rave reviews. Not to be overdramatic, but for simple comparison's sake, this might be the worst AYCE sushi experience I've had. Given, I haven't gone too many places, probably because once I find a good place, I keep going back, but I will not be returning to Heart Sushi. I usually do AYCE in Toronto and once in a while in Newmarket and I've never had a bad experience, and I wouldn't say this experience was 'bad,' but neither was it 'good.'"}
{"text":"This is very different from the Heartland location. They have two Tappanyaki tables, and my wife and I came on their Grand Opening day. Their staff are very friendly, but seems to be a little lacking in experience.
We were seated very quickly and was given a very simple menu. Price point is very good, and has a decent selection, but combos are limited in choices.
The apps are very nicely done, and, consider the price point, very impressive. Now, the main courses, the ingredients looks fresh and properly portioned. The chef was funny and has skill....entertaining skill, but not necessary cooking. Everything taste the same, and is on the salty side. The fried rice, Black Cod and lamb was cooked perfectly, the salmon was overcooked, and the scallops were very between just under and borderline overcooked. I'm partially impressed, but my wife was not impressed at all due to the Black Cod's over seasoning.
Now, the service side. We had no complain against the service our server provided, but the entire time we had a tray of wine glasses that sat beside us (we weren't sure if they were clean or used), and the finished crab at the other Tappanyaki table that had all the scraps piled on but no one took it away. The chairs were still all over the place in the Tappanyaki side, and the seating area next to it has tables not cleared and dirty dishes busing trays are still sitting on the tables from the Grand Opening party. That's a no-no by any standard, understaffed or not.
I hope they only learn and not make such mistakes again."}
{"text":"New cool place in town. A friend went and couldn't stop talking about the great food. So, I decided to suggest it for a friend post-Christmas madness get together.
We LOVED it. It is not like other places where you have gazillion dishes to choose from, but that's what allow them to give you the best food.
We ordered the food on the restaurant's iPad, and the food start to arrive within a minute.
One of my friends is a foody, and she analyze everything down to the texture of the food (she would be writing reviews if she is not so busy fuzzing over her toddler).
Oh, we're SO going to come back for more!"}
{"text":"The best AYCE in Mississauga! The food is delicious and the menu offers a pretty good selection. Our favorite on the menu has to be the salmon sashimi because they serve it on ice yumm!! Also big fans of the hot and sour soup, the pink lady roll and of course, the ice cream!
Service is good and the atmosphere is even better. Love the decor and how spacious the restaurant is. Definitely trumps 168 sushi, spoon & fork and umi sushi :)"}
{"text":"Visited Heart Sushi with a few fellow yelpers on a Sunday night.
I was impressed. 
I REALLY like this place and I'm glad to have a go-to sushi place in Heartland.

Their seaweed salad was delicious, I could've had two.
I loved the sashimi and their rolls!
I didn't love their nigiri though, I much prefer the rolls, my favourite being the spicy salmon and spicy salmon avocado. So creamy, so delicious!
Also, I liked their dishware. The soya sauce bowl was deep which I noticed and appreciated for an all you can eat spot lol!

Their soups were tasty and nice and warm.
Their teapots looked nice, like they came from Teavana.
The iPad ordering system was fun.

Also they have mouthwash in the bathrooms (which were very clean). The place is pretty, white, bright, and modern.  Some of the dishes have different colour lights in them. So pretty.

I really liked the food and look forward to visiting again. After a shopping trip!!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the AYCE selection, some items are not usually found in AYCE joints in Toronto of higher price range!!
Service pretty responsive and speedy, never had mixed/wrong orders.
Will definitely be back again when I'm in Mississauga in the future."}
{"text":"A friend recommended us to try the Teppanyaki here. We came here on a Saturday at around 6pm. The Teppanyaki side of the restaurant was pretty empty. We ordered the dinner sets which had shrimp, black cod and beef. They were out of black cod that day and they substituted it with salmon instead. My friend got the lobster, scallop and fillet mignon. 

The portion of the food here was pretty big but the chef here didn't seem like he knew what he was doing. Most of our food was overcooked. Only the medium rare fillet mignon was cooked properly. The salmon and scallops were left on the grill for too long and by the time it was served they were overcooked.  The salmon was dry. For the beef I ordered medium and came out well done. 

The fried rice, sushi and vegetables were good though. 

The experience we had here wasn't that great. The chef didn't really interact with any of the customers on the table. He pretty much did his own thing and tried to cook too many things at once. 

I guess a tip for future customers is that you should remind the chef when to flip your food or else it would end up overcooked."}
{"text":"Great sushi, decent service, great ambiance, great presentation. 

My party and I were sited in the back room which felt a little cramped but wasn't too bad. Not much else I can really complain about. I will go again. I enjoy the iPads so I don't order too much and see what else I'm waiting on."}
{"text":"I went there for Friday night date night with the boyfriend. We watched it go up since the boyfriend lives less than a five minute drive from there & were finally checking it out since it opened. 

When we first entered we noticed it was busy, which is a good thing no? But no one greeted us, the hostess who we didn't know she was the hostess at first, walked by us many times & we made eye contact each time yet she never once: 1. Smiled 2. Greeted us or 3. Acknowledged us. 

Finally when she came back to the hostess table it wasn't even a \"Hello\" it was an abrupt \"Are you Lou?\" 

We were asked if we wanted to sit at a table by the door & when we said no, they took my name & went to find another table; we were sat within 5 minutes. 

Of course, another sushi place that uses iPads to place orders. Looking at the menu, I was surprise they offered so much: typical AYCE sushi items, \"Korean corner,\" pad Thai, curry & grilled items.  

We began to order & the food came out very quickly. We started off with soups & appetizers. The wonton soup we ordered was bland, the wontons were ok. The deep fried scallops were the same as any other place that serves them but the fried cheese wontons were pretty good. The teriyaki dishes we moved onto were mediocre. We noticed the chicken teriyaki that came out wasn't even warm; it was smothered in teriyaki sauce but it was cold. 

We waited a very long time for our shrimp tempura which was the same as any other AYCE sushi place. 

We noticed a few of our orders didn't come but seem to register on the iPad without the serve doing their thing when you submit an order. It seems, when you submit an order & the screen goes black telling you that your serve will be with you shortly, if they're not there within a certain time frame to do whatever they do with your order, the iPad times out & says \"Your order has been submitted.\" But anyway, orders that were requested & sent in by the server didn't come: sashimi orders & other sushi rolls. 

We saw the Las Vegas roll being sent to another table & inquired about it. We were intrigued & thought we'd give it a try after the server gave us a review of \"It's our most popular roll.\" It was awful! I have never had such a maki roll in my life! It was deep fried garbage! & it's components made no sense: cooked salmon, cream cheese & mango sauce drizzle?! Gross. 

We ordered our dessert which was the typical deep fried banana & ice cream. They offered tiramisu as a dessert option which I had to try. Terrible, horrible, bad mistake. It was a lady finger soaked in something trying to be liqueur & whipped cream on top in a shot glass - nothing like the picture by the way. It also tasted nothing like tiramisu. I know it shouldn't be a surprise for a sushi place but it wasn't even appetizing! It tasted like fridge, you know, when you leave something uncovered in a crowded fridge & it smells & then food begins to taste like how it smells? Yes, that's their tiramisu. 

The only thing that wasn't bad was the service; the servers always ensured our glasses were full & the table was cleared. 

For $24.99 +tax per person (Friday - Sunday  costs) I think there are other - BETTER AYCE sushi places I'd rather go to & recommend. 

I don't plan on ever going back."}
{"text":"Heart Sushi has good food and a great atmosphere. $25 per person and lots of choices including the standard sushi fare plus korean and chinese dishes.
Fast service and a cool IPad ordering system at each table. It does need a better wine selection."}
{"text":"Food was amazing BUUUUTTTTTTT... the servers lack manners and friendliness!! They tried charging us for an extra person and when trying to show them that they got rude. Before all that, you could tell they were trying to push us to leave! Let's not forget them basically throwing the plates of food down on the table."}
{"text":"Been here for the all you can eat sushi before , fast and friendly for a sushi joint ! 

But last night was a great experience , if you have never had teppanyaki(Japanese chef cooks in front of you) before I strongly suggest to go here ! Food was good and the cook was entertaining. I have been to another teppanyaki place before where the cook was dry and did minimal tricks and jokes. 

The Portion of the food was a lot, so I had some left overs and the price was well worth the food and experience."}
{"text":"We went to Heart Sushi after reading all the rave reviews on Yelp. We really, really expected something better.

Yes, the place is large and clean and the iPad ordering service is super neat. We definitely appreciated the friendly and quick service and nice food presentation too. But the food? Nope. 

We didn't do AYCE because we weren't that hungry. We just ordered a few rolls. They all tasted the same, no kidding. I mean, they weren't disgusting or anything, but they were all very bland. I really couldn't tell which one was which. That's not what you want from a sushi place.

I am really surprised to see here almost 150 reviews, mostly very positive. Perhaps people had better luck with the AYCE? Or maybe they are used to grocery store bought sushi? Not sure. Either way, we won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Didn't meet my expectation at all... Well, maybe I got fooled by instagram ad but other ayce places were better. I liked how their sushi rice portion was small for ayce sushi but other than that, my overall experience was terrible. Their kitchen food were too blunt, and all their meat were frozen meat not defrosted properly. Steak teriyaki tasted like rubber in teriyaki sauce and even though it was beef it tasted a little fishy. Sushi was ok. Kitchen food was terrible."}
{"text":"The sushi is decent. There are not that many people during lunch hours. Environment and setting of the restaurant is very soothing which gives customers a very relaxing feel while having their meals. Other than all you can eat they also do a la carte and take out. For their Sushi their rice to fish(salmon, tuna) proportion is not that great. There is too much rice compared to the fish they give. Other than that food is okay, not anything spectacular. Soft drinks costs extra money (free refills) unlike some other which gives it for free."}
{"text":"I went to Heart Sushi today for AYCE sushi. I have previously visit Heart sushi in Heartland Town Centre and loved it! But this place was horrible! Seaweed salad smelt foul I couldnt even eat it. Salmon was dry! Beef short ribs were fatty. And service was slow. Once upside the sushi pizza and General Tao Chicken were crispy!"}
{"text":"New opening restaurant. Excellent customer service! Will come back again! Great place to hang out with friends!"}
{"text":"I went during lunch time and thought at first to order from the menu but then changed my mind to just do buffet. I and my friend ordered sushi and I swear it tasted as it was just sitting in the fridge for a long time. It did not taste good, dynamite sushi tasted like a fused dynamite, it was not crispy at all. 

Only thing that was good were the Korean Ribs. 

I would not recommend this place for lunch."}
{"text":"This USED to be my favorite sushi joint. When it first opened, the quality was amazing and everything was delicious. I'm writing this as I'm sitting in heart sushi. I couldn't even finish my meal! The sashimi tastes awful (not fresh at all) , the tempuras are soggy, the ribs barely had any meat on it and the rice was super hard. They have also forgotten our orders many many times. 
Our server however was very polite and nice so that made the experience a little less horrible.
Overall, don't waste you're money here. There are plenty of other sushi joints that have better food."}
{"text":"It was ok... service was so so.  I feel when here... you are timed and the bill was magically slipped onto our table right after the limited desserts were ordered.

Sushi selections were more than some places...however not the best AYCE place I have been to."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had dinner at Hearts Sushi on Saturday.  Their price for weekend ACE dinner was $26.99.  It is a few dollars more expensive than Prince Sushi's weekend price.
Hearts uses an ipad ordering system (big deal to all you people that give a poorer rating if the restautant uses pen and paper).  The fiod selection at Hearts was very limited on the sashimi side.  They lacked many items which most other Japanese restaurants carry.  The only bright spot was the dessert menu.  The lychee mousse was excellent.
I'll stick to Prince Sushi for our next AYCE Japanese meal"}
{"text":"This was my first impression. I'll eventually come back after a few months n will update.

3 stars coz the food was good and place was clean. Ipads are similar to the one's in sushi 168. 

Deducted 2 stars coz 1) they dont accept debit. People coming there for the first time wont know this hence they should inform in the beginning. 2) service was terrible at the end: we had a problem ordering dessert as the options wont send. Someone came to fix it then 5 mins later another person comes to ask us if we're going to order dessert. Then our dessert came n they took the ipad, so if we wanted to order more we couldnt."}
{"text":"This place has really come a long way since it first opened. I remember my friends telling me it was pretty terrible in the beginning and that always dissuaded me from going (opted for 168 instead). But it has apparently gotten better and so I thought I would check it out. I was definitely not disappointed. The sushi and the rolls were really good, and I'd even say it's better than 168. My favourite part was that what we actually ordered on the ipad came. In 168 the manager would always come to check our ipad and delete random items which was really annoying. 

The only issue I have is that they don't take debit for whatever reason. Credit or cash only which isn't always convenient."}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is great and so is the customer service! Solid location too. Looking forward to AYCE on the patio during the summer!"}
{"text":"I was expecting the same type of service and food as the other location but I was wrong. This location is worse than the other as the food was not the same and the service was bad. I felt very rushed when I was eating and a lot of my food was not cooked properly. 

Although the the interior is very nice and fancy, I was very disappointed about the food. They had the iPad menu ordering system which was very convenient.  

There are a lot more sushi buffet that are all-you-can-eat for much better than this place. I like heart sushi, but this location did not make it. 

I would not recommend this to a friend or come back."}
{"text":"My first review on Yelp and decided to try the newly opened Heart Sushi in Heartland Town Center

The rolls where fresh, with very little rice and not over done with mayo and sauces.   

You order from an iPad which is easy to use 

This is my new go to AYCE

Oh almost forgot to mention they serve a great Diet Coke fountain in a Coca Cola glass!!!  Keeping it classy"}
{"text":"The decor is very nice. The sushi was decent. There was less rice with each piece so you can eat more, which I like. It's less wasteful.

They make use of a tablet for ordering the food. Being a UI specialist, I had issue with the UI but I won't blame the restaurant for that. But since they used the tablet, there are pictures of the food that you're ordering. Some of these were rather misleading.

I had ordered something that in the picture looked like grilled chicken (it might have been called yakitori chicken but I'm not sure) and looked pretty light in colour but when it showed up, it was so dark that I didn't recognize it as what I ordered. I thought it was the next item in the menu that looked pretty dark. Similarly, the picture of the tiramisu makes you think you're going to get something very delicious, with many layers to the cake. When it showed up, it looked like a cookie the size of a quarter, topped with a squirt of cream. It was so exceptionally tiny, I couldn't get any of the tiramisu taste. I was extremely disappointed.

Overall, it was alright. I wasn't completely wowed by it but if friends/family wanted to go, I wouldn't object."}
{"text":"The food here is very good. Ordered a wide variety of sushi and appetizers. The food quality is very good. The service was decent as well. Their deserts were okay nothing to write about. One aspect where I feel they can improve is the desert. All in all a nice restaurant with very good ambiance."}
{"text":"Overly expensive AYCE sushi restaurant. Sushi is average. Sashimis are yummy & fresh! Cheese wonton is probably the best. I like that you get to order through ipad and send the order right away with one click. Torched sushi? whats the hype? tasted just like any regular grilled fish. Service was just SOOOO DISAPPOINTING. For $31 WITHOUT DRINKS INCLUDED on a WEEKEND DINNER? Just seems not fair enough."}
{"text":"As part of my team's Friday lunch outing, we went to Heart Sushi. It was perhaps a fifteen-minute drive over to the plaza.

I was initially following a colleague driving over there. Unfortunately, he seemed lost, so I zoomed past him and took the lead. It delighted my passengers!

Anyway, the plaza can get busy, but we got there at noon. There were a decent number of parking spots available.

We had made a reservation and were guided to our tables (two of them that seated seven of us) at the back of the restaurant. We were presented two iPads. Let the ordering begin!

I sat at a table with two heavyweight all-you-can-eat colleagues. My manager and my longest-serving student seem to have bottomless stomachs. The latter has been to this location in the past, so she went ahead and ordered a ton of stuff with me.

I love edamame. I downed an entire portion. Yum! It was perfectly salted and prepared.

The miso salad was delicious. I don't recommend the won ton soup. I have had better.

We ordered the crab shrimp tempura. The former is imitation crab, so I wouldn't order that again. The latter was yummy.

My student and I went crazy with the spicy crab, salmon avocado, and avocado sushi rolls. All were delicious and perfect. I learned that my student loves avocado! We also ordered eels sushi rolls. We didn't like them.

We both gave the ramen a go. I ordered the chicken miso ramen. It was decent, but the portion size was too small. I wanted more! I will order a couple more down the road.

I felt like a handroll and got the cucumber avocado hand roll. It had a ton of ingredients and was scrumptious.

When we felt like we had had enough, we ordered dessert. I loved the mango pudding (my student recommended it) and the tiramisu. Again, portion sizes are dinky, so I ordered again. The strawberry cake was also delightful.

I enjoyed my time here. I normally don't like to go to buffets or all-you-can-eat places, because I'm afraid of not being able to fit through both the restaurant door and my car door after eating there. However, the food was decent, fast, and yummy. I would come back here and give it another whirl.

{"text":"I am really disappointed in this place. The dynamite roll was horrible. They didn't give me one of my orders, and the chicken balls were obviously left waiting for a while because they hardened by time I got them. The fried rice had no taste. I did not like sitting so close to other people and the tables are too small for an AYCE. On a brighter note, I do think the decor is modern and appealing. Also, the coconut ice cream and mango pudding (though small portions) are the only things worth going back for."}
{"text":"Came here to try the AYCE dinner for the first time tonight and it was a big disappointment.  Given that the dinner prices were $33 for adults, it was totally not worth it.  The only plus was that my 12 year old daughter was charged only $15.

Our first round of food included the following:

Salmon & shrimp sashimi - 3 stars - good but not great

Octopus sashimi & Surf clam & crabmeat - 2 stars - pretty tasteless

Salads (avocado, salmon) - 3.5 stars - not bad

Grilled eggplants - 3 stars - taste good but it's more Chinese style (where is the bonito flakes?)

Scallop sashimi - 1 star - no taste at all, shouldn't         bother putting this on the menu!

Beef enoki mushrooms - 0 star - how can anything taste this bad!

Salmon Tataki - 3 stars - okay

Unagi handrolls - 2 stars (surprised as it was really good when we order it last time as a la carte).

Thai coconut shrimps - 3 stars - tasty but just a bit over fried.

Grilled mushrooms - 1 star -didn't think you can ever go wrong with this dish!

Tempura broccoli - 4 stars - finally something taste good!

Har Gow (shrimp dumpling dim sum) - 0 star -skin was too thick and shrimp was tasteless - suggest that they remove this from their menu!

2nd round of Salmon sashimi - 1 star - there was absolutely no taste (did they serve us a different quality grade on our 2nd order?). I told the waiter to take the dish away with most of pieces still on the plate.  I explained that it didn't taste very good but he didn't seem too concern.

Food was well presented and ambiance was very nice.

I hope that management realizes that they seriously need to improve the food quality.  We will definitely not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Sure was fun ordering via a tablet! It was my husband's idea because he's such a gadget freak and incidentally he loves Japanese food. Anyway, it was all right and our orders came in just a few minutes-- but as in any AYCE sushi you can't expect high quality food. Sashimi was sliced too thinly, and the ramen wasn't anywhere near an authentic one. Well it's not a ramen place after all so that's forgivable. They also offer Thai and a few Korean dishes, but I think it would be better for them to stick to Japanese. I was looking for takoyaki balls but there weren't any. I loved the eel sushi though, and the hand rolls-- fresh, tasty nori with morsels of goodness inside. I kept having both eel sushi and eel hand rolls. Red bean and green tea ice cream were also good. I would come back again if only for EEL and ice cream, but coming for lunch would be much better value which is about 16 dollars compared to 24 or 25 for dinner."}
{"text":"I am giving this restaurant 4 stars (almost 5 stars, but our server was just average) The sushi here (especially the Sashimi) was very fresh, and there are a wide selection of side dishes to choose from. The restaurant itself is very clean with a modern decor, definitely one of the best AYCE sushi places in the Mississauga/Toronto area :)"}
{"text":"although I love heart sushi, the service at their Britannia and mavis location started getting to me so I was so happy to learn they opened another location! I came super late (about 20 min before the kitchen closed) but staff were so willing to let me put in our orders. 
at the other location the staff become incredibly rude about their kitchen closing time. at this location they didn't really rush us into paying out bill, they just made sure we were done ordering by a certain time

food was great -pretty much the same as the mavis location. will totally come back."}
{"text":"everytime i get a sushi craving i msg my friends to join me and we already know where we are gna go.. thats to HEART SUSHI! 

this place is seriously the best. the staff are actually nice and check up on you compared to other sushi restos where they dont give an eff. their sushi is good not too much rice and always fresh! example-spicy crispy salmon rolls..the tempura bits in there are actually warm and crunchy instead of turnng into a soggy paste tht ive been served at other restaurants.

their menu is huge and ive tried many of the chinese and thai dishes all of which were good and come out piping hot.  

the only complaint i can have is one time i went and the waiter refused to clear dishes that had just one sushi piece left on it. like dude...no one is gna eat the end piece of sushi that barely has fillings in it. get over it.

decor is pretty and booths are comfy. not much more u can ask for :)"}
{"text":"Have been reluctant to try this place out simply because most AYCE are mediocre sushi at best. We decided on the 40 PC sushi/sashimi/maki platter. Don't think they differentiate between their take out and AYCE sushi, which they should. sashimi was stringy and too thick. Maki was uninteresting. Don't think I would go again."}
{"text":"Extraordinarily mediocre. Literally had no items stand out to me - it's just a very trendy looking all you can eat sushi place that's missing good sushi and most other items. 

At this point, I've learned to never try ayce outside of toronto. I'll just be disappointed.

I came for the weekend lunch buffet for $19.99. Came out to $25 for the most mediocre sushi meal of my life, if you can even call it that. It pretty much felt like robbery; you'd be better off going to an a la carte sushi restaurant.

Where to start on the menu items ...
Thai Chicken Skewer: dry chicken
Sushi rolls: huge unprofessionally cut rolls (very uneven pieces) filled with cucumber and no interesting or special rolls
Wonton Soup: sooooooooo doughy and soup portion was like seasoned water
Pork Katsu Cutlet: barely any pork and just dried out with ample breading
Sesame Ball: again ... soooooooo doughy
Teriyaki: extremely average
Kalbi: decent

Just ..... terrible menu selection with little variety.

Dessert was nothing enjoyable either. You need to order through the server who then immediately serves you your bill upon delivering your desserts. I immediately felt pressured to leave and could not just sit down and enjoy my ice cream. 

Coconut ice cream and mango ice cream were good, but it's hard to mess that up. The lychee and sesame mousse were pretty gross in texture; thankfully the portion size is one lick. There was a butter-y after taste that was unpleasant. 

Avoid, don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Genuinely the best sushi place i've had in canada. I love their tempura everything and their breaded shrimp!!"}
{"text":"When I heard another AYCE sushi place arrived in GTA west, I was a skeptic as I've encountered average or mediocre food with subpar service (Think Prince Sushi, Wasabi...). After seeing positive yelp comments, I decided it was high time I tried this place.  I will say, it's the best AYCE I've had in GTA West.  GTA East still has us beat but this one actually can hold it's own.  Compared to real sushi places like Toshi, Dai Ichi, or Sushi House Brampton, this place is not as good BUT for an AYCE, it definitely takes the top GTA West spot for me

The atmosphere is modern and open.  I like how we're not crammed into another table and we have the ability to hold a conversation without screaming at each other. We went the first moment it opened for Friday dinner and we  were seated promptly.  As mentioned by other yelpers, it has the nifty iPad to just order to your hearts content.  It's great as you don't have to flag someone down and it's a scary tally to see how much you ordered over time.  I will say the service was very prompt... I think after our first set of ordering, we got the meals hot on the tables within 15 minutes.  

Our table tried EVERYTHING... I think it's safe to say they do the cooked foods best and maki rolls aren't bad.  The sushi nigiri is probably just slightly better than store bought sushi... the fish quality wasn't bad but they really load up on the rice and it kinda falls apart when you pick it up with the chopsticks. The kalbi ribs was tender and flavourful.  Salmon teriyaki wasn't over cooked and had some nice crispy edges.  Dynamite rolls was fairly well made and had a nicely hot crispy tempura shrimp.  Tempura was freshly made and hot from the fryer... it could have been a little lighter on the batter but it decent.  Sashimi was a bit thinly sliced but they weren't rubbery or mushy.  They were ok.  The udon and fried rice was a bit on the oily side but wasn't cloying or heavily dosed with soya sauce.  Ice cream desserts were what you'd expect... cold and creamy.

For the price and it being an AYCE, the quality was pretty good.  I would say that I'll return if we were just looking for decent Japanese food."}
{"text":"The servers were not polite enough. Food and Dessert was good. Not so fast service! I would not say this was a great experience for me!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty great! The speed, the food and the staff were all awesome! Love the salmon sashimi, best I've ever had. A little pricey, but it was definitely worth it. The food was the bomb!!!!"}
{"text":"came here with a few coworkers. had a pretty fun time as there were a couple of people in our group that were sushi noobs and weren't comfortable eating the raw stuff.
the food itself was pretty standard, nothing really stoody out to me. what i did notice on the menu though was a lot of chinese dishes and some korean stuff as well. 90% sure this was a chinese owned and operated restaurant.
service at times was good, and at times was quite bad.
when we first arrived, we asked for a table for 7 and the server, in a very annoyed tone, said that we should make reservations for a big group next time cus they may not have a table for us without one... the restaurant had PLENTY (80%) of open tables, so i don't see why she was making a big deal out of it.
in many ways, the servers just seemed very stuck up.
but yea, like i said the food was standard and the tea pot is heavy."}
{"text":"I've been here twice a month in between, i was really excited to try a new place. I heard of it on the top 10 list for sushi in Mississauga. I'm not sure why it is on the list. I would not come here just for sushi. It's very bland tasting. I love that they have so many options more than other places I have to say everything ELSE besides the sushi was awesome. I would come here again if i wanted fish/chicken/rice."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for 4 in the evening, service was ok. This is the first ayce sushi place that serves sushi before the appetizer... the food taste was average."}
{"text":"Used to love coming here when it first opened, the manager/owner even knew me.  That's how often I used to come.  There quality was 10 x better before, they used to actually care when plating your food and their service was a lot smoother.

Quality went downhill, as with majority of these AYCE sushi restaurants.  They do great the first year or so and after that everything is just not the same as it used to be.

It is also very inconsistent, sometimes you get the sauce for your cheese wonton or chicken cutlet, sometimes you don't.  Sometimes the beef enoki is dry, sometimes it's not.  Sometimes their seaweed salad is ranky, sometimes it's even crystalized from being in the freezer.

Also, what's up with these servers giving you all these orders you didn't even order?  It pretty much happens with every AYCE restaurant you go to.

I'm definitely not a frequent customer here anymore. I only go here if I have a bad craving of sushi.  If you're expecting great quality, don't even bother and go elsewhere.  Unless you're new to the sushi game then by all means this is the place for you!

My favourites:  Salmon Tataki, and their Salmon Chips (the other Heart Sushi location doesn't make it the same)"}
{"text":"I really liked the ambiance of Heart Sushi. The food came out at record speed. At the end if our amazing AYCE lunch we had 1 tempura sweet potatoe, a few pieces of tofu and some left over rice from the nigiri. Our server told us we had to eat everything or we will be charged.  There was by no means any excessive leftovers. Charged for rice?? I thought that when you order food and pay for it it's yours to do as you wish. Take it home, throw it out, chew it up spit it out ...whatever  She was rude as she threw the bill down and explained that we should order dinner next time we come. We won't be coming again."}
{"text":"This is my second time to this AYCE sushi place. Comparing to the heart sushi at heartland. The food here is comparatively better. I love their sweet shrimp and scallop sashimi. 

Similar to other AYCE place, it is really noisy, and you have two hour. The one thing that disappointed me is that the dessert. They don't have most stuff on menu. We waited 15 mins for them to tell us they don't have.

Hopefully it would be better next time. I recommend this location, and will come again."}
{"text":"Overall, wide selection, fast service, and a clean establishment. This was the soft opening, so I will update my review again once they have their grand opening.

We ordered from the Japanese selection (sashimi, sushi, tempura, dessert). This is an AYCE restaurant with Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Thai cuisines. It's around $30pp, but drinks are not included (not even green tea, unlike most - if not all - AYCE/ Japanese restaurants). Not including drinks makes this place a bit pricier than other AYCE restaurants, and there is no cash discount (although you can buy a VIP card for $10 which entitles you to discounts - I'm guessing? 10% - not sure if you have to pay cash or can pay credit.

The food was good, but not great. Some of the sauces lacked a bit of flavour. They had a very large selection, but it seemed like a bit too much to choose from and some of my favourite items were not on the menu (no beef tataki, scallop sashimi, chopped ika, creme brulee, or ginger milk). I know some of those items are not available at all AYCE, but most places offer beef tataki and creme brulee. 

The sashimi tasted fresh, and the eggplant was simple. I was happy that they didn't include the typical flakes on the eggplant. The satay skewers were moist and flavourful,  and the coconut shrimp was delicious. They have a wide selection of desserts - their cappuccino ice cream, and mango / mocha cakes were great! I liked that the portions of food were smaller, so you won't have to worry about over-ordering if you take it at an easy pace. They use the iPad ordering system which is very convenient. The metal knobs they have on the middle of the table are the iPad stands (we had no idea until they told us).

Service was decent, but when we first sat down we had 4 or so different servers ask us how many people, what we were drinking, etc., which was a bit excessive. Also, every time they took away a plate, we were asked if we were done with it. If it's to the side and empty, it's safe to assume we are done (: I understand for a soft opening they want to ensure you're looked after, which we were, but I only want to be asked once while I settle in. There needs to be a bit more coordination on that front."}
{"text":"Great decor to greet you. You make your
Orders on an iPad. Weekend pricing is about $25/pp. Food is fresh and prompt. It's refreshing to see sashimi served on ice, and it keeps it tasting fresh. Only thing stopping me from giving a 5th star is there have been a few occasions where we have ordered food and it has either been forgotten about or inaccurate. Overall a good experience. We frequent here often, as the food is good, most non-alcoholic drinks are included in the price, and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"All of the salmon pieces in my hand roll had the bloodline still attached, which was honestly gross. I have never seen this practice even in AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"Uhh... I love Ipads, Iphones, Icomputers, Itouchmyself... Joking...

I think the ONLY good thing about this place is that you get to order with Ipads. I think it is an unnecessary gimmick... Food is more important then these novelty items for me unfortunately... 

I review sushi based on two things:
1. Type of sushi (buffet versus al la carte) 
2. Sushi prepared by whom (Chinese, Caucasians, Japanese, Korean)

This place is a Sushi buffet cooked by Chinese people -nothing wrong with this at all, because most buffets generally are and some turn out quite well. 

You may try if you want to play with free Ipads or hey, why don't you just visit the Apple store :) It is a sushi buffet so we expect quality to drop. The Kitchen items are relatively tasty... but I mean, you do get sick of it after a few bites. The sushi is VERY bland... Fish is a bit on the unfresh side... and the rest of the menu falls on the sweeter side of things. 

Wonderful service staff! Except this one girl. She was definitely having a bad day haha. She had this angry looking face all day. She would bring us our food and slam it at the very edge of the table. But I mean, as a customer you need to be polite always and so we were... tipped her well because I mean you reap what you sow? Anyways, the other service staff were very genuine. So if you like poor quality food, Ipads and friendly wait-staff, then by all means."}
{"text":"Great variety of sushi and Asian hot dishes. Presentation is also great. Tasted better than the similar concept downtown. Was not big fan of the desserts. Overall I would go back for the sushi."}
{"text":"I came here again 2 days ago and the servers were actually really nice!! And got most of my orders to the table. I got all you can eat for dinner and everything was delicious as always"}
{"text":"Was very surprised today with Heart Sushi.  Usually everything is on point however food and service was of poor quality. Seriously would it hurt to crack a smile or be polite.  I can understand it's not An easy job but when you got nice customers don't take your frustrations out on us. Food was pretty bad tonight not the usual quality."}
{"text":"Other than the sashimi slices being kinda on the thin side this place is excellent!  
They have the right combination of attentive, friendly service staff, nice atmosphere and the excellent ipad ordering system!

The shrimp tempura was made well with the right amount of crispness.
The mackerel was also excellent.

Will definitely come back here now that Yang's sushi is off the radar...

BTW, make sure you get your frequent diner card where you can get a free dinner after 10 visits!!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic (been on 4 separate occasions and all were positive). The ordering on iPads is okay..however each time i've gone something doesn't come. The staff is mediocre at best- not attentive, very distracted with running food (some are better than others). Overall: Food= 4.5/5 Service= 3.5/5 Atmosphere= 4/5"}
{"text":"The place inside is pretty cool, nice decor. Food is not the greatest, there are better AYCE sushi places, portions are very very small, but this way you can try many things and dont over eat. Tataki is great, order more than 1 right away. Weekends are very busy, reservation would help"}
{"text":"I love Heart Sushi.  It's probably the best ayce in Mississauga.  I love their Bristol location, but it's temporarily closed, so I go to this one for the time being.  Dinner options are great; lunch is good enough.  Overall, I am a regular here and no complaints... except lately...I've been seeing a lot of fruit flies.  I didn't mind it at first, but with each visit since the time I noticed this problem, it's really started to annoy me...and today I had a wonderful meal, but seeing those fruit flies made me lose my appetite (and I have a huge appetite).  I still finished everything I ordered, but something must be done about those fruit flies."}
{"text":"Ambience is good, nice decor. Service was good for Friday evening crowd. Portion size is small but then you can order multiple times for all you can eat. There's not much vegetarian options but it's nothing unusual for Asian food."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and delicious food! The quality of sushi was great and there are many vegetarian options. Everyone serving our table of 4 was helpful and always smiling. We had the chance to speak with Phillip from head office who told us that people are their priority and I couldn't agree more."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday for dinner and everything was just sub par at best. This is probably the last time I'm going to this restaurant not because of how mediocre the food was but because of how they run their business. We were over charged because they baked in the gratuity to the price without warning. Usually at other restaurants there will be a clear indication that the tip was already included at 18% with the dollar amount, but this place just gave us a lump sum without warning so I ended up tipping on top of the 18% percent that they felt they were entitled to. It was a special occasion so I footed the bill and when you're paying for 5 people that's a hell of a lot of money for tips."}
{"text":"We went here for AYCE lunch and I've got to say this place is just OK. The food itself isn't horrible but it's not enjoyable either. The sushi featured very thin slices of fish and was mostly rice. The special rolls weren't all that tasty. I can't think of a single one I'd get again. The maki rolls were decently made but again there's something with the rice that they use that makes it taste blander than other sushi spots.

There are a few dishes I would definitely avoid ordering though because they're just so bad. The Heart Sushi salad is just iceberg lettuce with shreds of carrots and thin slices of cucumber. There is no dressing at all on it (or maybe they forgot to put it on- I'm not sure). The other dish I'd avoid is the ramen. I suspect the ramen came from an instant noodle package and they tossed some corn, a bit of seaweed and a single shrimp in it and called it a day.

On the upside, the inside is pretty trendy/upscale and they use a nifty ipad system that actually works very well since it shows you pictures and descriptions of everything you can order. The servers don't speak english very well so it's a good thing they have the ipads. The prices are a little bit higher than other nearby AYCE yet the place was packed so they must be doing something right."}
{"text":"Came here for both AYCE lunch and dinner! From what I recall, lunch was somewhere in the $20 range, and dinner was $33. I loved the electronic ordering just because it made it very quick and simple. The decor was super nice, and the restaurant is very clean.
Service was fantastic, servers and manager were all very friendly, and the food came in a timely manner. The sushi was fresh and tasted great. I especially loved the salmon sashimi (only available at dinner). 
The only downside to me personally was the dessert. I did not quite enjoy their selection of dessert, and of what I usually get at other places, it wasn't that great either. 
Overall, I would most definitely return - fantastic! :)"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  And every time I finish ayce sushi I regret it.  Doesn't take away from this place.

Service:  amazing.  This place is so efficient with their ordering system.  Unlike other ayce sushi places they don't forget orders or if they do it's pretty rare.  And since its iPad ordering u can say we didn't get this and we ordered it and show them so there is no confusion.

Food:  average.  I feel like they got a lot more options recently with new items.  It's great for an ayce sushi place like 5 stars.  

Price:  the price is a little steep on weekends.  Perhaps go there for lunch or weekday dinner."}
{"text":"I think I should  call myself a sushi connoisseur  with the frequent sushi trips. LOL.   I prefer to use sushi ayce   as a post workout meal when i workout at a gym with a buddy since we can eat and  hangout after the  workout. Heart Sushi serves up some amazing sushi and their ipad menu  makes the dining  process really flexible .  My favourites are the salmon and mackerel sashimi   and the obligatory california rolls.  Our food was fresh, service was great and if we go to the  gym beside it again and are in the mood we will have ayce sushi. We usually have this routine when we workout at other gyms around the city with a sushi spot nearby"}
{"text":"Foods are not fresh, and some of them feel microwaved for example their Thai curry chicken is cold and warm, and only microwave can do that"}
{"text":"Heart sushi, you hit my heart where it hurts most with all your delicious food and the taste buds were dancing in happiness"}
{"text":"Came here for AYCE dinner about a month ago. It was an early dinner on a weekday, and this location had recently opened so it wasn't that busy. Food was good and the place was clean and spacious. 

Taste:  4/5
Service: 3/5
Atmosphere: 4/5
Value for Money: 3/5
Would I come again: Yes"}
{"text":"This place has both all you can eat and Al a cart sushi and it's pretty average for the price.
This used to be my go to all you can eat sushi place back in the day when I could eat AYCE. The appetizers are good and fresh. They offer a huge selection of the fried stuff. My favourite are the shrimp chips which are crunchy and thin. If you love all the fried stuff then you would love this place. Some of the stir fried chicken items are smelly though. 
The sushi on the other hand is pretty average. The fish is fresh but the rolls are massive. Now the big size is a negative thing for me because they are impossible to fit in your mouth. They do offer some interesting rolls like the gym roll which has both shrimps and Banana. 
The portion of the desserts are super tiny and they always have a freezer taste. The ice cream on the other hand is not bad. Now that I have discovered way better sushi places in Misssisauga I have stopped coming here."}
{"text":"Tasty! Great selection and service. 
Loved the iPad menus! 
Clean and great location!"}
{"text":"Come here often when I'm craving sushi.. usually like once a month. Service is okay. I feel like the more I go the worse the service is getting. Server's don't really speak much just bring out the food which is fine except when you want to ask a question they run by you so fast. All of the sushi is delicious tho. Oh yeah and the mango ice cream of course!"}
{"text":"When it comes to AYCE sushi, I find that the quality isn't the greatest.
Especially when paying 29.99 for dinner, which is excessive. I've been to other sushi restaurants and 29.99 is a lot, even for a weekend.
First thing, there was a hair on my breaded shrimp. 
The fried rice is extremely oily. 
The sashimi was kind of warm. 
Some of the plates weren't clean. 
Although, service is really quick and we did get all the items we ordered. 
I just wanted to try this place because there was all this hype about it.
I won't be returning. 
Too expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the heartland location so I decided to try this location. The service was good and food was also great. One of my favorite AYCE places in Mississauga. Much better than the previous Tako Sushi that was here."}
{"text":"Best all you can eat sushi place in mississauga!! Highly recommend it. Good price , good service!!!"}
{"text":"This sushi joint is located at Fairview mall. Restaurant is nice, bright, clean and spacious. Service was accomodating. We have a baby and a stroller, server quickly moved us to a bigger table in the corner to accomodate stroller. 

My review is based on lunch AYCE.
They offer a large variety of items on lunch menu: sushi, dim sum, Thai curries, fried rices, etc. You can choose to have dinner menu at lunch if you wish to have more variety. We went with lunch menu. 
Food quality is just so so. I came here mostly for sushi and didn't care too much for other items. Sushi quality is 4/10. I had some dim sum items which were ok 5/10. 

Overall, nice spacious place with good service but I'm a bit disappointed with food quality"}
{"text":"This used to be our go to AYCE sushi until I got sick last time. We usually went for dinner but last time we made it for lunch. It was a quiet day, maybe a Monday, but that never bothered us.

As always we ordered up our drinks, and started with a couple of appetizers. Within 10 minutes of having his beer served to him, my boyfriend found a fly in it. No problem, we had it replaced.

When the sushi arrived, we noticed something completely different from usual. It was soft and kind of like a soggy feeling, rolls falling apart and tasted stale. It was as if they were trying to move their left over dishes. We had to send two trays of sushi back. 

At this point I pretty much lost my appetite and we decided to finish whatever was left on our table .. until I bit down on something hard - a chipped tooth. My stomach turned completely and I couldn't believe what just happened. We had enough. Called for the bill and left. 

My boyfriend and I then headed to AMC to catch a movie he was really eager to see. In the theater, I still felt my stomach turning, something wasn't right. I tried making myself feel comfortable on the seats but that didn't help. My boyfriend insisted we go home but I told him I could probably manage - 5 minutes later I threw up in the theater (sorry AMC employees). 

The next couple of days I threw up over and over until I felt like my insides were going to fall out. Never going back here again."}
{"text":"A mediocre area sushi option.  

What seemed promising at first - bright, white, spacious, hip and featuring iPad ordering - was quickly deflated like a dollar store birthday balloon on arrival of some ordered items.

First, I fond the iPad ordering convenient and pleasant. It allows me to take my time in deciding what I want and mix & match my own lunch. A normal bent box just doesn't cut it when you get unwanted items so this flexibility is appreciated. I don't know why every restaurant isn't doing this yet.

The soup didn't come first - just as well as it was a wonton soup with bland broth. With iPad ordering it's inevitable that the fastest items made will he out first... but it's soup. It's likely already made and sitting in a warming pot. 

Next was a great shrimp tempura followed by a very non-tempura \"onion tempura\". The menu image tricked me into thinking I'd get a hand battered onion ring, but no I got a substandard cooked-from-frozen Costco variety plain breaded onion ring. Served with ketchup no less. The clue should have been the fries included in the tempura section of the menu. However the picture and description were enough to convince me I was getting a \"jumbo Spanish onion\" ring in tempura batter, not a microscopic premade onion ring.

Most of the other dishes were fine. Nothing epic here. For a sushi place I expected more varieties of sushi and maybe even some sashimi, but not a single slice of fresh sashimi could be found.

There are other interesting items I may try if I return. ..none of which appear Japanese. There's a nice looking Thai chicken satay skewer and some Thai curries and pad thais. Korean spicy beef and some szechuan chicken dishes.

But for these I usually pick a restaurant that does Thai or Chinese cuisine.

Your mileage may very, I saw lots of satisfied customers here."}
{"text":"The first time I visited Heart Sushi (the same week they first opened up) I was greeted with a warm welcome. The variety was great, the food was fantastic, I had no complaints. I've been to Heart Sushi several times since and unfortunately its quality has been on a steep decline. They've spiked their prices, reduced their quality and portions. They used to provide great service (Frank, the owner, used to walk around and ask each table how they felt about the establishment), now you'll just receive your typical dry, AYCE sushi attitude from each server."}
{"text":"One of the worst sushi I've ever had! We went there for ayce lunch. We ordered the spicy salmon roll and it tasted horrible. It had little bits and pieces of red and green peppers inside. We tried the spicy salmon sushi and the fish was not fresh. We had the edamames and they were soggy and brown. We asked for water and it came in 2 clear glasses. One of the water was slightly brown. We asked for a spoon and our waiter kept forgetting to bring it. The ramen was very gingery, was very hard to get rid of the taste after. I don't recommend going to this place. We should've just had the sushi in the mall."}
{"text":"Great AYCE, but service can be slow when it's busy or near closing. On one visit, our server told us that it was last call for lunch AYCE, so we ordered another round + our deserts. The deserts never came & when we asked about it, the girl kind of gave attitude, but it was only the one time out of many."}
{"text":"FOOD - Huge selection with little serving per order which is good since reorder is fast. Food wastage is less likely.
FOOD ORDERING - Eat all you can. Ordering by iPad. 
LOCATION - Conveniently accessible at Heartland area. Accessible by private and public transport 
PARKING - Ample parking available
AMBIANCE - Classy, comfortable seating, quiet
SERVICE - Fast and efficient

 Most impressive was a birthday cake with pastries for each guest. The cake and pastry isn't available in the menu. It's specially for birthday celebrants and guests. Love this touch'"}
{"text":"Went a second time to heart. Wasn't as impressed with the quality this time around. The quality is starting to decline and reminds me of 168 grade AYCE.

Still a fun place to go with groups for AYCE, but should not be considered amongst quality sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"I spent a while deciding on the rating of the place and still can't really put my finger on it so I guess a 3 out of 5 will do.

It's a spacious place; clean, tall ceilings, ample parking spots, ipad ordering menus. Reservations are accepted and the service was super friendly. Half my party was late and they still honored our reservation and seated us. The manager actually kept walking by and made sure our table was happy. I came on a weekend and this place wasn't too packed and there wasn't too long of a wait for other people.

However, I'm a bit disappointed at the food. It was your average ayce fair, however, very average, like very very very average (slightly leaning on below average). I'm not sure if it's the rice that's off, or the ingredients inside, but every bite of sushi I took wasn't too overly satisfying. We also ordered some of their rice and udon dishes and my tip would be to shy away from those. Dessert selection was limited as well. I guess for the price you're paying, it's what you get. You can find better ayce places elsewhere but at a higher cost. 

Overall, okay place to fix your sushi cravings - stick with your basics: the sushi, tempuras, meat, and other fried items. Avoid their rice and noodle dishes (especially the curry ones). Heart Sushi is still a decent place in terms of the Mississauga area though!"}
{"text":"We were conflicted between the great google reviews and bad reviews on yelp; so we thought we'd try our luck.
The sushi here was...questionable. The sashimi didn't taste fresh, the maki rolls were soggy. We tried chicken and beef dishes, they were gross. The tempura tasted freshly fried but was also drenched in oil. Even the cucumbers tasted like they've gone bad. 
Dessert was equally as awful as the dinner.  On the plus, the décor was nice and the severs were relatively friendly. But that doesn't take away the tummy ache I had all night after eating at this restaurant. 
I really don't know how this place got such great reviews on google. Trust YELP and find another AYCE."}
{"text":"I've eaten here with my family several times, and the staff is super quick, the atmosphere is nice, and most importantly, the food is just splendid.  They have unique choices that sound really strange, but once you try it, you want to have more and more!  Although it is not the greatest sushi I have ever had, it is always a great experience and a place to try new things.  They also have lovely plating styles, which are just a pleasure to look at.  If you want your sushi fix, this is a great place to get it!"}
{"text":"The sushi and sashimi is excellent. Just the right quantity per order. The staff need better training to sharpen their customer service skills."}
{"text":"Five of us went there for lunch buffet on Wednesday and three of us had food poison and one of us had really bad food poison for 2 days! Feeling really sorry for my friend and wish I was the one who had the serious food poison as I picked this place for her birthday! :(. Really disappointed and will never visit this one again! Clean and safe food is a must and totally unacceptable! Just don't go!"}
{"text":"Good for all you can eat and in a rush.  Quality of sushi is just ok but fine for AYCE."}
{"text":"I went for all you can eat lunch on a Friday. The place was pretty packed. Having been to a tonne of AYCE sushi places around the GTA, I'd say this place is decent. Not the one of the best, but definitely one of the better ones in Mississauga. Nice decor, I loved ordering on the iPad, you can submit your order from your table, you don't have to keep submitting a piece of paper to a server. The food started arriving pretty quickly and we were submitting orders frequently.

The fish was not as fresh as I like, but it was still good. There is no sashimi at lunch.
Items worth trying: beef gyoza, red dynamite roll, white tuna sushi, spicy tuna sushi and tiramisu
Pass on the udons in general and fried chicken balls. The seafood udon I ordered was tasteless and the chicken smelled old. Other than those two items, the rest of the meal was great. We had miso soup, rainbow roll, spicy salmon roll, deep fried imitation scallop, salmon pizza, avocado pizza, wonton soup and everything was good. 

Definitely worth trying as there isn't a lot of choice for AYCE in sauga."}
{"text":"I'm still glad to say that Heart Sushi is still my favourite AYCE sushi restaurant. Their quality and presentation remain the same since opening day. Usually AYCE's slowly deteriorate but not Heart. Orders come out fast and they haven't forgotten any of my orders. Their sashimi is always fresh and delicious! I'm already on my second stamp card. You should definitely take advantage of their stamp card because no other restaurant has this perk.

I think their prices have gone up because it's pretty much $30 (including tax) on weekends."}
{"text":"This is a place with a good selection of AUCE and we do like going here, especially in a group as AUCE is always better in a group.  

We prefer to fill up on the sashimi instead of the sushi as the rice is so filling and you definitely do not get to maximize your AUCE options.  Haha.  The salmon head and mackerel whole fish are very good indeed.  They also have a salmon cocktail which is super yummy as it is finely sliced with red onions accompanying the dish.  The onions bring out the salmon slices so well.  The desserts to go for would be the mango yoghurt and mango pudding.  Good mango flavour in both.  The red bean ice cream is also a treat with generous portions of red bean in it.  

If we happen to go for lunch, we will ask to upgrade to the dinner menu instead as they do not have sashimi available on the lunch menu.  They do keep you coming back because of their frequent stamp cards.  10 dinners with them and you get 1 free AUCE dinner.  

We have always had a good experience here.  They are very quick with their service too."}
{"text":"We came here very hungry on a Saturday and although the place was full we only had to wait a few minutes to be seated. Yay! 

Even though they aren't affiliated I can't help but compare this place to Sushi Legend in terms of price point and similar offerings. 

The best part about this place is that the sashimi here is very fresh but everything else is a bit disappointing. Either the ingredients weren't fresh or the dish wasn't executed well. 

Things to avoid: The wonton soup? Absolutely terrible. One of my favorite AYCE dishes, enoki mushroom wrapped in beef was a bit dry. And the mango yogurt dessert? Watered down. The torched sushi had a bit too much mayo for my liking but this seems to be the case for every AYCE sushi place, even Kaka. 

Things to get: Cream of mushroom soup was delicious. The Kalbi beef was solid. The bacon carbonara was also yummy and something I don't see at most places."}
{"text":"Woohoo another AYCE sushi place in Mississauga! HAD To visit :)

We came here a month ago for dinner, just didn't bother writing the review because I thought Heart Sushi was average -not totally amazing. They have the same ipad menu as K&B Sushi in Oakville. And it's not quite exciting when you have to wait for the waiter to come over , click some buttons, then she sends your order! Well, what if **I** want to send the order? SADFACEPOUT
(UPDATE: you can now send order directly from your ipad!!! Amazing!)

The sushi and sashimi were very bland, but salmon was pretty good. Lots of nice Korean dishes! Beef ribs were tasty, seaweed salad was LITTLE (doubled our order later, of course). Was hoping they'd have squid because Saki Sushi has squid! No.. they don't have it... also their buffet menu is STILL not online.

All in all, average AYCE but will definitely visit again. Great service, really elegant plates, nice seating and lots of table space (huge plus!!).

Parking here is so awful because they have a teenie weenie lot. But luckily Heartland provides ample parking space ALL AROUND!"}
{"text":"Great service! Large menu! Yet Wish they kept the old decor was beautiful when called Spring Rolls! Good tasting food! A must visit!"}
{"text":"Been back a few times since my first visit. The management was very kind and helpful - concerned about patrons going out in bad weather. The wait staff was a little slow and not great at communicating however I've still given 5 stars because the food was soooo good. I leave there way to full and swearing I'll never do it again, but much like Tequila, I always go back. :)"}
{"text":"Went there on Friday night 
The all you can eat deal is pretty good
Like the system of ordering on an iPad 
The staff was courteous 
The hot chocolate wasn't good enough. Too watery."}
{"text":"Very good sushi place in Mississauga - probably my fav ayce place here. I always end up going here when I'm craving ayce sushi. The place is very clean and well decorated with heart decor, and the sushi and food is very good. 

I came here once with some friends at 9:30pm and they close at 10:00pm - we were really craving ayce sushi. The servers were nice enough to accommodate us and serve us until closing. We ended up having to order everything we wanted in one order, but we left satisfied. We were super thankful that they let us in and accommodated us despite being so close to closing. We tipped extra. Thank guys! :D

- the sashimi is great and cut nicely and not too thin like in other places
-  they have a large variety of food items - even dim sum and Korean options
- all the orders are done via an iPad so it's super easy to order and keep track of your orders
- service is fast
- dessert options are great - I personally love the mango pudding

Good stuff."}
