{"text":"Very tasty. A lot like pop-eye but spicy is better.like Thursdays deal.3.99 for 3 pieces and cab add a side or two for 1.25 each! Not too shabby."}
{"text":"Thoroughly disappointed. If you enjoy Popeyes don't even bother going here thought I was eating food from an airline, very bland. Place looks clean, had a 3 piece, coleslaw and mashed.... the biscuit and the Pepsi was the best part."}
{"text":"My sister told me about this place so decided to check it out. It is in the old Popeye's location and like another Yelper stated menu is similar as well. We got chicken strips and sandwich to go. Tenders must've been good as my son was quite all the way home while he devoured it. 

Sandwich I'm sure would've tasted much better if I ate it right away but the Cajun fries were delish"}
{"text":"I love fried chicken and this restaurant did not disappoint. I went there together with a colleague and we both ordered the 2 piece dinners (leg and thigh). The chicken was fresh, crunchy and moist. It had good flavour and was well seasoned. The biscuit and fries were also great. I would have rated it 5 stars if they had provided a dipping sauce for the chicken. We were told that we have to pay extra for sauces. If you love fried chicken, I would definitely recommend trying Quik Chik."}
{"text":"I visited place with my 2 kids on 28th Dec at around 2 PM. One of kids wanted to eat only chicken and biscuit so I thought asking the person at reception counter to assist us finding the right meal choice. Reception counter wasn't busy at all as we were the only people in line at that time. We were disappointed because the person ( a female staff) was not ready to talk and assist. Anyway somehow we fegured it out and placed our order. Staff didn't pass any curtesy  comments like thank you etc. 
Food was good.
We will visit this place again and
hope Quik Chik trains there staff with more efficiency before deploying them at front line."}
{"text":"Gross place, avoid it. Went to the location in Heartland. We discovered that the pop machine had ZERO carbonation, to which they claimed 'they'll look into it'. They definitely were just trying to cut costs and the pop basically tasted like flat syrup. I ordered the rice and beans side, which was obviously not cooked together as rice and beans, but rather, rice + some kind of bean filler (like with tacos). The bowl they came in had the beans on the bottom and rice on top - so they didn't even bother to mix it to try and pass it off as rice and beans. The whole place had an atmosphere of being cheap, gross and dilapidated, like there is little care put into the place or running it well. Nobody was in there during a dinner time hour, it was empty. Afterwards I got an allergic reaction, with a rash/red bumps, itchy throat and swollen arms. I am quite confident it came from this food as nothing else I did or consumed that day was out of the ordinary but it was my first time eating here. You got a feel here that all the food is made by cutting corners or use products with sub-par ingredients. Yes it's obviously a popeye's knockoff but that doesn't mean it has to be gross."}
{"text":"this place made me sick. the biscuit was raw on the inside and the chicken was just gross. do not go here!"}
{"text":"For those who are curious about trying Quik Chik, hopefully this will be a fair review.  Really, there is virtually nothing to complain about.

This is, essentially, a Popeyes clone.  Their concept is almost identical and one has to wonder if it was inspired by Popeye's temporary departure from the Mississauga market.  Now that the AFC chain has returned, Quik Chik remains a viable contender.  Across visits, their chicken pieces really live up to their slogan, \"Crispy and Crunchy\".  In addition, their pieces tend to me medium to large size.  They are full of flavour without being too salty.  

Although they are very similar to Popeyes in many respects, Quik Chik represents superior value.  Their daily deals are almost the same but cost slightly less.  Additional sides that accompany daily deals are still only $1.  Finally, their individual side order portions are more generous.  For example, an individual Quik Chik's red beans and rice serving is at least 25% larger than Popeyes.

Across visits, service has consistently been fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Ordered through UberEats. Delivery was fine, order was fine, didn't experience any problems. I'd say Quik Chik fits between KFC and Popeyes. Popeyes is my favourite because they season the chicken and KFC's chicken is very crispy but the chicken doesn't really taste like anything. Quik Chik's chicken is really crispy and the meat seems to be slightly seasoned, but not by much. The sides are decent too, so overall I had an okay experience, but next time I think I'll just get Popeyes."}
{"text":"Was very hesitant to try because the name is not so appealing to me.  The spicy chicken is actually good....not that spicy...but  good and juicy.  Fairly large pieces and very similar to Popeyes texture but quite different in taste.  I would come on a Tuesday or Thursday when they have a chicken special.  A very good alternative to Popeyes."}
{"text":"Very surprised on how amazing all the food tasted. This time around we came hungry...got spicy chi burger combo's with cajun fries and poutine. They had the thick cavendish(battered) fries-cajun flavoured. Really tasty and soooo crispy. The poutine followed suit...
If you are in heartland...go to Quik Chik!
Their fries sure as hell beat Popoyes!"}
{"text":"Went to the one in Brampton, but it's not on Yelp, so I'll review it here.
 Like most fried chicken places, this joint is seriously overpriced, but I went on a \"Customer Appreciation Day\" and they had a great deal: 7 or 8 pieces for $8.99, as I recall.
 It was 11.30 and the place was already filling up with kids from the local high school, but there were plenty of staff and the service was friendly and prompt.
 My wife and I got two orders, one spicy and one regular; it was freshly fried and piping hot.
 We had planned to take it home for supper, but we decided to \"try some\" in the car...
six pieces later we looked at each other and agreed: \"Best fried chicken, ever!\"
 It was crispy, hot, flavourful, spicy and juicy. I don't think I'll ever go near KFC again, and at that price it put Popeye's to shame.
 We ended up getting another two orders. That was about 30 pieces of fried chicken for under $40...an unheard of value, in my experience. It was enough chicken for about four more meals for the two of us over the next three days.
 If that chicken was that price on a regular basis, I'd have to be rolled out of the basement to take my dog for a walk. Luckily [?], that price was a \"one off\", but if you want to try some fine fried chicken, here's the place to go."}
{"text":"Will not return.   This place is disorganized and just not my type of place. The tables were sticky and the service was slow and the customers were loud and obnoxious and too much trash in the parking lot. This place is third world sheik if you feel a need to punish your bowels"}
{"text":"To those people that are comparing it to Popeye's -- don't believe the hype. It's like seeing those Michael Jackson and Elvis impersonators... They're okay, but still nothing close to the real deal.

The chicken itself was just okay. Skin wasn't crispy, but I do admit it was juicy. The Cajun fries were pretty good.. It's got some kick to it without being spicy. I'd say it was comparable to Popeye's. Their hot sauce tasted like Frank's Red Hot Sauce imho. Didn't get a chance to try the biscuits, but my coworker said they were delicious (not Red Lobster level though)."}
{"text":"This was my first visit ever to any Quik Chik. I got 5 drumsticks on 10 piece box. I got two drumsticks on a 3 piece order,  even though the order says 1 of each drumstick, thigh and wing. I also got the cashiers suggestion,  an order of $7 butter chicken and rice and received a half filled container of disappointment.  The fried chicken was good but I will not be visiting this location again and I suggest trying the other location on Dundas if you're curious. Otherwise just stick to Popeyes."}
{"text":"Walked in for a quick bite. Got myself a chicken sandwich and boy it was tasty. The service was very fast and I was served quickly.

The staff was very friendly. Would return back only at this location."}
{"text":"Skip the sandwiches, not good imho,this place has the best fried chicken on the bone. I wasn't a fan of fried chicken until I tried their chicken, you can get spicy or mild both are good. So moist! Better than some fancy restaurant versions I've had."}
{"text":"They've improved their spicy recipe and is a bit spicier now.  Tastes better now.  They keep the place a lot cleaner the old Popeyes previously located here.  

Also, for some reason, each time I get a 2 or 3 pc combo, I get an extra piece, so super bonus.  Their cajun fries are really good too."}
{"text":"This franchise of Quik Chic is awesome. The guy omar who runs this outlet has great customer services. Chicken was neat and clean well fried yet so juicy. However i did not like the beef burger which i dont blame them as its not their speciality. I highly recommend quick chic to everyone looking for halal kfc"}
{"text":"Didn't expect it but the chicken sandwich was excellent. The bun was puffy and fresh, the chicken tasty and the just a bit spicy mayo (this is the mild flavor) complemented it well."}
{"text":"Bought their Winter Special:
10 pcs dark meat with 
1 large side
$23.99

Spicy mayo (large) $0.50.
It was 10:15 pm when I made the order.
Had to wait 12 min for freshly fried chicken.

The wait was worth it.
The chicken was moist and crispy.
Fries were slightly crispy.

Customer service was ok."}
{"text":"Love this place!  The staff and owners are super friendly.  The space is clean....and the chicken is delicious!  By far superior to any other fried chicken places around."}
{"text":"If you are in the area - you have to visit this location of Quik Chik! If you don't - you will regret it your entire life. 

You will always wonder. Why did Umar say that on yelp? Why did he say I would regret it? Did I make a mistake? What if I move away and never visit Toronto again? What if I have never truly tasted fried chicken before because I hadn't visited that Quik Chik location? Is my life a lie? Is the chicken I have been eating a fraud? What is chicken? 

Don't worry though because it's not too late. If you are reading this - maybe you still live in the GTA...maybe you are visiting or you are going to visit Toronto. Maybe you are just shopping at the Walmart nearby. Whatever the case - fate has led you to my review. Fate has brought your eyes to my words. And if we play our cards right - if we work together -  fate will lead you to chicken glory. What is chicken glory? You will only know once you enter the doors of 1476 dundas avenue east.

Why am I leaving a second review? well because it was my destiny to convince you. to lead you. to bring you joy. (and also because I ate here yesterday + it tasted awesome + Wednesday burger special FTW).

MUST READ DISCLAIMER: I would suggest taking the food to go unless you want to gain 5-10 lbs. If you dine-in you will realize how awesome it is and then order more chicken. and then more chicken. and then more chicken. and then more chicken.

If this message helped you acquire the glorious chicken burger or chicken pieces at this location. Feel free to pick up an extra chicken burger for me. Spicy. My office is near Eglington and 427 (east of dixie). inbox me for details. I appreciate you."}
{"text":"Just came back from Quik Chik. It was nice, fresh , i like the chicken but the fries are also very tasty. Sometimes they had good deals . The spicy chicken is not  spicy at all, they should  go one notch on the spice. The place is clean but the floors are always sticky. The staff is nice, it could be better if they smiled once in a while."}
{"text":"This location just opened in June.I bought a 3 piece meal.It wasn't busy during the mid afternoon,one customer,me.The front counter person who may be the owner/manager wasn't personable.The flavor shots at the fountain were covered with a white piece of paper.Before viewing a picture online,I asked him what it was because I was looking for the ice dispenser. He never explained. Unenthusiastic interaction between this man,and myself who was their ONLY customer,and was looking forward to trying their halal fried chicken. I nearly wanted to just not order,and go elsewhere.The chicken was disappointing to okay at best. The rings were okay,and the biscuit was slightly better.First,and last visit."}
{"text":"This is my 4th time here , it's great, clean and tasty and the kids love it.
The chicken is fresh and tastes wonderful than any fried chicken even KFC !!
And the great thing about it is that it's Halal !!!
It's always an option whenever we think of eating outside.
Always check the daily specials, they are a great savings.
Also the family meals are great and they are very fulfilling.
Also the shrimp butterflies or popcorn are a great side dish with your meal!!"}
{"text":"Better than Popeyes, its juicier, crispier, and just all around more delicious. You literally feel like you are in heaven just after one bite. (That's what the bf says) The biscuits are delicious. Service is good and relatively quick. We have only ever ordered to go. Thankfully the fries have never gone soggy while we transport our food home. If you are looking for a fried chicken place this is a must go. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Chicken was surprisingly good! I'm usually a Popeyes fan, and only a Popeyes fan. But tried this place, and the chicken was not just crispy, it was SUPER juicy and flavorful.

Fries aren't as good as popeyes, but a great cajun fries still.

It was also super busy when we went. Albeit it was a Tuesday. 10 person customer line, and growing. And this was after 1pm."}
{"text":"HALAL

This place took over what used to be a Popeye's location.

Their food is good but it's not great. It's not oily or greasy. There was something missing in the taste of the chicken, we felt. We visited twice and each time the taste was the same but it just wasn't that tasty. It's cooked well and marinated but it was missing something."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 3. The chicken burger as definitely okay, and meatier than what you get at KFC. At the same time, the prices are higher too. I liked the onion rings, although you get so few of them and the box is so tiny! The inside looks very bare and economical."}
{"text":"Always great food. Good sized portions. Very flavourful. Some of the best wings I have ever had."}
{"text":"Yum! Who doesn't like fried chicken! 

I came here with my friend on a Thursday night. It was not busy at all! For their Thursday special - it was 3 pieces for 4.95, add another 1.25 for a drink OR side. They make the OR very clearly ha! 

My friend and I ordered the Thursday special with one side order of fries and we also ordered the five wing combo - which comes with a fries and drink, this was around 6.75. As the Thursday special features the pieces of chicken - we didn't have to wait much. But for the wings... I felt like it was an upward of 15mins. BUT IT WAS WORTH IT! The wings were so fresh, tasty and juicy, I loved it! I would strongly recommend the wings if you are in no rush :)

Other than that, it's a typical fried chicken place - maybe a bit more cooked to perfection (unlike many places that over cook!) - the fries where also pretty good - Cajun dusted! Yumyum!"}
{"text":"Fries are good. Chicken lacks consistency as some are tender some very fibrous. We found a hair strand in one piece which we brought to the notice of the guy. He seemed not too interested instead just asked the server to replace the piece. This was not really acceptable as he should have been atleast apologetic. Anyways the covered area beside the road has a solarium feel and looks nice."}
