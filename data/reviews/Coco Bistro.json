{"text":"Coco Bistro just opened close to work. I was looking forward to trying this place for lunch because the options around us are limited. I got 2 cabbage rolls from their hot counter. The taste was okay, but wasn't very hot and cost me $9. 
Although this experience was just so-so I am definitely going back to try something from their bakery counter (which looks very impressive) and their all day breakfast!"}
{"text":"2 stars - solely for the stores appearance and friendly staff 

Not impressed with the prices based on the quality of food I received. $4.99 for the driest sliver of red velvet cake?! $13.99 for bacon, eggs, and McCain fries? No thanks!"}
{"text":"Wasn't thinking of going here originally, but I stopped by anyways and was completely blown away with everything as soon as I walked through the door.

- Great service. The employees were very friendly from start to finish. They came to check up on us a few times and once even asked us if we preferred the music loud or quiet. 

- Delicious food. I had the french toast with caramel drizzle and a Ice cream Coffee. I do not remember what kind of gelato I had in my coffee but it had walnuts in it and it was a very interesting drink. French toast was nice and crispy on the outside with a light drizzle of caramel on top. My friend had a strawberry and banana smoothie that was really good and another one had a Latte that was really rich and creamy. A bit pricey but all worth it.

- Decor was very pretty. As soon as we walk in there was a great glass display that had many desserts (However, most of the desserts are not on the menu they give so I would recommend choosing first downstairs if you're considering going upstairs to eat). I would recommend sitting upstairs to eat!!"}
{"text":"The service is friendly, loved the d√©cor, they have an upstairs seating which looks very classy. I had the grilled chicken salad, the chicken had just the right spices and grilled perfectly, the salad was crispy fresh. I had a pecan tart for desert, it was good to. Really good value."}
{"text":"I'm sorry did you say you're open till midnight everyday and  3am on weekends?! You mean I DONT have to always resort to nasty pizza!? And I can get coffee after 9pm when most bistros and cafes in Toronto close down?!

That's a major win. 

Massive selection of dessert, not so top quality in my opinion but hey it works for a late night sugar craving. Espresso was good. Haven't tried the hot table food yet. The place looks nice inside I wish they put less tables downstairs though it's pretty crammed. Also the one cash register thing doesn't quite work during peak hours. I had to wait 10 mins to pay for a damn tart cuz there was a huge lineup for lunch hot table ahead of me. A different cash register for coffee/dessert bar would really speed up the process"}

We came here because my husband was very hungry.  We looked for a restaurant that serves breakfast or brunch. Coco bistro is very close to our place only 5 minutes away. The restaurant is small but has 2 storeys so it seems it can accommodate lots of people. The decor is nice and modern. It is very attractive.  They have lots of sweets that I want to try but I wasn't very hungry at that time so we ordered crepe Medley ($14), Burek Slice with Cheese ($6), a strawberry smoothie and a regular coffee.  

$14 for a crepe - It seems very pricey for me.  It was tasty but it wasn't worth it.  
Burek pita - I haven't had it before and I didn't like it.  My husband said it was good but it wasn't good enough for me. It was cold, tough and looked like it stayed there for more than a day!

I wouldn't come back here for a brunch unless they gonna drop their price or make their dishes more interesting. However, their sweets look good and the atmosphere is perfect for chatting.  I might be come back for that reason."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my birthday and I said to my partner \"I want cake\" who doesnt want cake on there birthday. Remembering that Coco Bistro had just opened awhile back across the street from our old residence we wondered up to see there menu.

I highly recommend this bistro to everyone! there baked goods are amazing! the staff were fantastic, full of energy! and boy can I tell you, once they found out it was my birthday! I was spoiled with a free chocolate filled croissant. The owner happened to be in the bistro at that time and when she heard it was my birthday she allowed me to choose anything in the display cases, of course another cupcake was needed!

This place knows how to treat customers, they offer such a wide variety of food items on there menu! I will be going back for sure this weekend for there breakfast!"}
{"text":"Such a nice spot to be at in the morning with a big breakfast. They have a lot of selections and are flexible in mix and match of different breakfast choices. Great service."}
{"text":"Came for coffee next door and stayed at Coco's instead. The coffee here is great and the breakfast selection is good. We had the spinach and feta pie, not sure it's called that way but it was good."}
{"text":"Passing by right after the Jays game, Coco bakery bistro adds some character to this stretch of the road.  Though there are some delicatessen places like Starbucks and Second Cup, Coco Bakery Bistro is one a higher level providing specialty foods specifically for those with a sweet tooth.  
From macaroon,  canolis,  savoring cake slices and muffins they have a lot of options.
The places is pretty new as its been in business for a few months,  clean, chic, and the staff are extremely kind.
After taking time to decide I tried their toffee coffee muffin which was delish! And I would not hesitate to come back here...it's definitely a lot cozier that your Second Cup or Starbucks.  :)"}
{"text":"A great little bakery and street side cafe. Our family was traveling from Chicago and found this spot walking back from CN tower. 
Very friendly and accommodating staff. 
Good was average but pastries were very good. 
Reasonably priced meal for our family. 
Pulled pork and chicken panini were good burger was average. 
I would recommend especially to get away from the CN tower chaos."}
{"text":"We had their pulled pork sandwich and their bacon and egg burger (aioli, fried egg, bacon, chopped onion, some kind of BBQ sauce and mayo). They were both soo good. Especially the burger. The entrees didn't come with sides but it's so filling that you won't need it! Definitely coming back. 

The atmosphere is nice too."}
{"text":"Amazing foood. I am in luv with their Kale salad. Their egg corrisant is to die for and there coffee is pretty good."}
{"text":"Cute little place near the Rogers Centre!

As soon as you walk in, you see a glass showcase with a bunch of different sweets, but adjacent to that is a hot table with a menu above that, and the waitstaff sorta bombard you with the Specials.  There were a lot of options, so I had to ask them to repeat &/or choose something other than the Specials.

On the hot table, there were various things like bourekas, 2 different kinds of cabbage rolls, perogies, and other EE goodies.  Someone from the kitchen shouts out that they also have fresh Chicken Parm coming out of the oven!

Being 2-storeys, Coco Bistro is much larger than it looks from the outside.  Interior is nice and modern.  Second level offers a bit more privacy.  A bunch of EMS/Police Officers invaded while I was having my late lunch - a good sign?

Everything was good, approx. ~$30 for 2 lunches, including bottled drinks.  Service was very sweet, but they did come by quite often to make sure everything was ok, so I'm thinking the place has recently moved/new owners?

Great option if you're looking for something much nicer than Timmy's!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service. Great big smile, and helpful with questions I had around some European sausage they have. I couldn't decide between regular breakfast sausage or the Balkan one I've never tried and I was able to do one of each. I love it when places allow you to get half and half of the options available. 

Big portions. You get a lot of food for $15: 3 eggs, 2 sausages, toast, breakfast potatoes.. I might've forgotten something. 

Mighty Leaf tea in a variety of flavours. Bottomless drip coffee, I believe. 

Great hours--open early. Most places in the area either don't serve breakfast till later or just have quick grab and go items. This place had full breakfast early morning on a weekday. 

Not busy, which is awesome. 

She gave us a generous amount of free macarons after breakfast! 

Overall a great spot for breakfast on weekday mornings. 10-15 minute walk from the Metro Toronto Convention Centre."}
{"text":"My friend and I happened upon Coco Bistro on a Sunday morning walk; and decided to make a quick brunch of it!

This spot has a lovely ambiance, an array of baked goods, and lovely croissaint sandwiches and brunch options. There are two levels for seating (we sat on the main level). The decor is contemporary and the prices very reasonable. 

We definitely plan to return soon!"}
