{"text":"Simply put the food was only a small good. I had the beef/mushroom pot pie. No real issues but it was simple tasteless. 

Our server was a very nice young lady that very attentive."}
{"text":"I had to go back again and see what the Jug is about. 
I had a chance to sit down and try their traditional food. Sausage rolls and meat pies. 

The sausage rolls were amongst the best i've ever had. Their thursdays are a busy night to go as they have open mic night!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I live around the corner and went here for the first time 2 weeks ago. It is an authentic British pub with the decor to match. I've had the fish and chips and a chicken and goat cheese sandwich which were both excellent. The best thing there is the homemade french fries and gravy. Service was excellent. The staff is very friendly and the drinks are cold. Very good option for a family dinner or a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Service very good.    Food is definitely in house made.   Very fresh.  Delicious.  Will definitely return.   Definitely worth trying.   Daily specials every day!  Pints very reasonably priced."}
