{"text":"I went to Cherry-O's with my aunt and my mother. They had been before. I have always seen this place in passing, but never thought twice about going. The parking lot was almost always vacant upon passing, and it looked as if they didn't get much business. So I was very suprised when my mom and aunt spoke so highly about it.

Once inside, they sat us immediately,  after charging us for the buffet. We then started to make our plates. I got the fried chicken smothered in mustard based  barbecue sauce,  the liver and onions, the yams and mac. OH MY GOD!!!!! The liver and onions definitely took me back to my childhood, when my dad used to cook it. The gravy was yummy. I mixed it in with my MAC. The MAC needed a little salt, and more cheddar flavor, but since it is my favorite food, it was the first thing finished on my plate. 

I could have mashed the yams up and put them in a pie shell. They were really good! And the fried chicken alone could star in a separate restaurant which featured chicken. My mom and I raved about it the entire time. I probably will go as far to say, this was the best chicken, I have ever had. The chocolate cake sucked. You can tell it was store bought. But I personally HATE store bought cake... with the exception of casada cake. 

The service was great. The waiter checked on us often, refreshing our cokes, and bringing napkins and clearing our dishes. He was sweet. I had a great first time experience.  Will definitely be going back. 

I didn't take pics, until the end of the dinner, because I was SOOOOO preoccupied with my yummy dinner."}
{"text":"The dinner buffet was a total bluff most of the food was nasty and the customer service was pass poor. Its not worth 15.99 the food quality doesn't match the price to eat here. As far as customer service the guy assisting us took forever to get our drinks then brought us the wrong drinks our finished plates pilled up on our table because he never came and removed them. I only got one drink because he never asked did we need anything. I would never recommend this place to anyone..."}
{"text":"This place is a joke.i should of known something was fishy because every time I ride by the place is always empty.so I decided to make a call in since there's is only 1 freaking car in the whole parking lot it should be quick..order a wing dinner.i wanted to add some special sauce called semaj on my chicken, they had the nerve to tell me it's a extra $1 per wing for the sauce, so now my bill jump 2 an extra $4 for the wing dinner.so I pass on the secret sauce specially imported from france.thats they way the make it seem charging all that money..chicken was okay, mac and cheese was mushy and disgusting. This place is always empty..lol..they should be out of business 2015"}
{"text":"I love it here. The junkyard eggs are the best.  My husband loves the chicken, while I generally get the fish. I am a big fan of the breakfast, but have been there for dinner. 

This is a buffet style southern style soul food establishment. There are plenty televisions if you like to eat and watch tv. 

Very attentive staff and did I mention great food and breakfast for less than 10 dollars out the door, before tip of course."}
{"text":"When located in maple hts, I would have given this place 5 stars!  I still love the food to the utmost, it has to be some of the best food I have ever had at a southern style restaurant, but I feel they might have moved to fast, and weren't ready for a larger scale restaurant.  I keep going because of the food only. Not the beat customer service I have experienced in my life. Also they are definitely overpriced now. I don't go as much as I would like because of the price, and professionalism, but I do love the owners and the food! It definitely worth everyone giving them a try!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good. Practically ALL of it was  mouth watering...until my husband was getting ready to devour a piece of catfish that had at least a quarter inch of HAIR fried into it. No problem I thought, I'll just give it to our server (which was a sweet as the homemade ice cream they have there :)  Well giving that piece of fish to him to give to the manager turned out to be a huge mistake. No one ever came over to apologize or explain. When I asked to speak to the manager a woman came out and told me that \"It wasn't a hair, it was a BONE\" I tried to explain to her that bones weren't long and had a curl to them but she was VERY adamant about it being a bone. Needless to say I didn't and definitely could not win.  Well, the food was awesome, but please know that the customer doesn't have a chance in hell if something isn't right in there.  Oh please check out my FB page and see the BROKEN SINK in the men's room. Come to think of it, we should have left out of there after that last straw...but once again, that food was GOOD!!  Will I go back? probably...but NO TIME SOON.  Erica Cole (my FB has a pic of me and WIll I AM on it. PLEASE LOOK AT THE MEN'S ROOM SINK VIDEO PEOPLE!!!)"}
{"text":"Went to this place after waiting at another restaurant that wouldn't open. I was frustrated, hungry and evil when I went in there. That all changed in the first 10 minutes of being in there. I took my family there on a Saturday morning after waiting at another place for an hour. I found them on this site and decided to try it. I walked in with an attitude and was short with the staff but they continued to be friendly and nice. We were seated right away and I started making my children's plates. I should have known it was a good sign when I finally made my plate and came to sit down, all my children were quiet and asking for more, even my picky eater! The first bite I took sent me to heaven! The good was delicious!!! There were so many things to try. Their cheese grits were the best I've ever had. Their fresh melon was like a drug, it was the best ever. The staff was attentive and they were constantly bringing out new food. They had everything you could think of there. I loved the food and the music, it was a nice blend of old school R&B, newer R&B, and I wonderful fusion of jazz and hip hop. 

We love Cherry-O so much that we have gone again for the dinner buffet and love that! 

We drive all the way across town to come here and it gets better each time!"}
{"text":"Came here as part of a surprise party. Arrived a bit late for the actual party but the restaurant was still open. It was only about 6pm and the buffet has very slim pickings. The dinning room still had plently of people in it so you would think they would have refreshed it at least a little bit. everything had clearly been sitting there for a while so I just picked a few things here and there. Out of all the little bites I had the meat balls and mashed potatoes were the best options. My mother claims the beans were out of this world. She honestly wouldnt stop going on about them lol. The chicken was just okay. Everyone else in our party loved it. Our waitress was very helpful and nice. She helped a lot with truly making it a surprise. 
Not sure if it was just because the place is a little on the dark side or not but it seemed a little dirty. Probably just needs a bright new carpet to make it better. Just seemed like everything in there was a drab shade of brown. 
Dont think I will be coming back here unless invited back for another party."}
{"text":"I really really like this place but I feel like the move has affected the take-out service and my satisfaction is steadily declining. It's almost as if the back of house staff can't keep up with both the buffet and carry-out. I haven't dined in at the new location but the wait for carry-out is ridiculous at times, even when you call ahead.  They quote you a time and when you arrive your food still isn't ready. Every time I go in there, there's at least one person upset with their wait.  On two recent occasions people have left after waiting 45+ mins. I've waited as long as an hour and a half. I'VE NEVER ONCE HEARD AN APOLOGY EXTENDED TO ANYONE UPSET WITH THEIR EXPERIENCE. NOT ONCE. 

I ordered food tonight and was told I would be charged a \"double up-charge\" for requesting double mac and cheese for a meal that comes with two sides anyway.....mac and cheese is on the list of sides I can choose from so why can't I choose it twice? I have never heard of such a thing, it's outrageous.  It is only $2 but come on!!! I hate restaurants that try to nickel and dime their customers. Especially customers that just spent $40 on a take out order while your dining room is empty. I didn't ask for a \"premium side\" or \"signature side\" but just plain ole mac and cheese..."}
