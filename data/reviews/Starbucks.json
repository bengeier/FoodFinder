{"text":"I'm giving three stars mostly because I'm a big fan of Starbucks drinks, but this experience is certainly not the best. I wanted to order a latte macchiato, and I don't think the lady at the cashier knew they even have this drink at first. She first put cafe latte on the machine, and I saw it and corrected it. Then I was trying to personalize my drink a bit with less ice and almond milk. After I finished my request, the lady asked me again whether I was ordering a caramel macchiato. I corrected her again that I wanted a latte macchiato. Okay, then it finally showed the right drink on the cashier. I thought this was the end of the story but NO. The guy who was making my drink held a manual with his left hand the entire time while he was making my drink with only his right hand. I even saw him made a mistake at first and started over for my drink. Finally, I got my drink, but the taste was not good as it should taste since I had the same drink several times from another Starbucks store at CU. I understand this is a new Starbucks store, and they are obviously new hires who need a lot of practice. But they clearly need more training before serving real customers. How can employees not even remember the drinks on the menu (I'm definitely not ordering a very wired customized drink)? I hope the manager can pay more attention to the training standards of the employees."}
{"text":"Perfect Location!! I love the atmosphere and the staff they will become your neighbor hood friends.  Great Coffee and serves all together. The place is spick and span.!! I love their top patio over looking 4th Street!! very neat!!!"}
{"text":"I normally do not write reviews but I am surprised by how HORRIBLE the customer service is here. I used to work at starbucks and know a thing or two about the drinks but am not too picky since everything is fairly good. I have ordered at this location probably 4 times since it is convenient in the frys I shop at. I've received a couple wrong drinks but I've never said anything because it was small things like passion tea instead of passion tea lemonade and I like almost all starbucks drinks so nothing to make a fuss about. They are pretty slow but again, not worth the confrontation. But today, the service was appauling. My husband and I wanted some breakfast to hold us over while grocery shopping. I ordered a pepperoni and tomato foldover. After waiting I received a breakfast sandwich. I politely asked if I could get the foldover instead. Being pregnant now, my cravings and food aversions are pretty specific so while I would normally just take the hit and eat what I got, I wanted what I ordered today. The girl took my sandwich back and said she would give me the foldover.  I started shopping and left my husband to grab it for me. I waited a little bit to open my bag as I was busy shopping and also know the pastries can be super hot out of the starbucks oven. When I did get to my bag, I realized they had now given me a spinach foldover. Being almost done with my shopping at this point, I went to just get my money back. The gentleman that I spoke to asked the previous girl about how I had been given the wrong thing, to which she responded that they just don't have the pepperoni and tomato foldover. The man responded by saying what I thought was common sense..THAT IF YOU DONT HAVE THE THING I ORDERED, TO ASK IF I WANT SOMETHING ELSE INSTEAD OF JUST GIVING ME SOME RANDOM THING. The gentleman then said that they have a chorizo sandwich. I explained that I wanted the pepperoni foldover before, not a chorizo sandwich. he responded by saying, well we've never had that...like I should've known this somehow. I explained I was just ordering off the sign in the display case! He then reluctantly gave me cash back. Never NEVER again. After working in many customer service jobs including starbucks,  I have to say this is one of the worst experiences I have had."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because it just opened. Maybe it's because I've been anticipating the return of pumpkin spice, but I got the most delicious pumpkin spice latte I've ever experienced here. It's a little noisier than the Starbucks on North Prospect or South Neil, probably because of all the students. The decor is way nicer than their Green Street location. Very comfortable. I will be studying here often :)"}
{"text":"If the iced coffee was any colder I swear I'd be drinking it sitting on a iceberg! Service with a smile is always appreciated."}
{"text":"This is the worst Starbucks in Calgary. They can't make a soy drink without a half inch of solid in the bottom. When you ask for another one they are the snottiest little girls I've dealt with. If I'm paying 5 bucks for a drink I don't want disgusting slime in the bottom of it. I will do my best to not go there again."}
{"text":"We love this place!   My wife and I steal a mid week morning coffee in the William Penn. the atmosphere is regal and you can just hang out in the lobby forever.  The architecture is amazing and timeless."}
{"text":"drive thru is a little slow hope it stars getting faster soon"}
{"text":"The employees are toooooooooooo slow it takes them forever to prepare a cup of coffee"}
{"text":"The only thing I don't like about this location is that there is always trash on the floor, such as straw wrappers and other trash bits. I understand its located in a rough part of town, but a quick sweep every half hour wouldn't hurt. Other than that, the employees are very friendly, not at all rude, they always seem happy to help. Expect your drinks to not taste the same every time you order. Sometimes my iced coffee is too strong and other times its too sweet, I guess it depends on who's making it. Love this Starbucks though."}
{"text":"This location is absolutely terrible at paying attention to your order . I have tried it 5x with high hopes each time and each time they failed to get my order right. If you're in the area, I highly recommend the Starbucks inside the frys location. I am highly disappointed with this new location ."}
{"text":"A great place to relax and do work, the staff is friendly and always make your drink right. The interior is extremely chill with lounge chairs and interesting pictures. It's a great hangout spot or just to be on your own and study."}
{"text":"I loved Starbucks.... Until this last visit. When I walked into the men's bathroom, there were full cases of cups and coffee on a cart beside the toilet. I intended to ask the manager about it. But the crew just did not seem to have it together that day, so I gave up. I was in disbelief of storing food that will be served to customers beside the toilet. Pictures are in the photo area. Notice the half toilet paper roll on 1 of the boxes."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this Starbucks.  The baristas are terrific, the Manager, Jelly is excellent.  Often times, my tea drink is handed to me before I pay.  I love getting to know the baristas by name and they take the time to know me.  I pretty much know many Starbucks locations ( airports, other cities when I traveled a lot.. I always look for the closest one) and this Starbucks ranks up there in my top  5 as far as I'm concerned.   [I was so happy to see this one being built within 1.5 miles from where I live.  It's a great walk].  :-)"}
{"text":"Showed up here for coffee about 9:45pm...We could tell the staff were cleaning up and were not really interested in new customers. We placed our order which was actually quite simple (3 lattes and a chai) and the girl took our money dropped the change on the counter, finished wiping down her display case and then made our order... Not cool!!! For $5 coffees I expect better service than that."}
{"text":"I love this Starbucks. It's right across from where I work, I'm there practically every morning for my latte.  Staff knows my order by heart."}
{"text":"Great staff and great product at this location

This store is far too small! 

Starbucks needs to think about adding another store somewhere along Sheppard between Vic park and the 404 to lighten up the pressure on this store, you can never seem to get a spot to sit here!

And Starbucks also needs to fire those clowns at Allstream, the wifi is complete garbage, go back to the supplier you had before whoever they were."}
{"text":"The setting is nice and comfortable, but the starbucks drink is a bit more expensive then other location."}
{"text":"I asked them to add Some hot water to my Espresso , I think they added tap water to it
Disgusting !"}
{"text":"This is one of the cozier Starbucks in the area, particularly later at night, as it has the latest hours. While there are five Starbucks all within easy walking distance, this one is open at least an hour later than most on any given night of the week -- at late as 11PM on Fridays and Saturdays.

It also has a nicer layout than most Starbucks, with a roomier service area large seating area that's more secluded from the normal counter service and entry areas, yet still provides a nice ambience with cozy chairs right by the window. 

A nice place to go a grab a coffee and sit and read on a late night walk."}
{"text":"I only frequent this Starbucks because it's in a convenient location for me. Otherwise, I would not go here. 

If you go during peak hours, be prepared to wait. If you have somewhere to be or wanted to stop by here before getting to work, give yourself some time. Line will sometimes extend out to the Walgreens drive through pharmacy and the inside won't be any shorter.

Service kinda sucks here and the baristas are not the friendliest but oh well... Now for the drinks, just like other places, they're made inconsistently. Rarely do I think my drink was delicious but I always give them the benefit of the doubt for their seasonal flavors. But majority of the time, drinks here taste watered down even after adding an extra shot of espresso. I will say that I have never gotten my drink order messed up though!

Overall, this is my go to spot if I need a quick caffeine fix that's near home and don't feel like driving far for some better coffee. This place isn't the best but it gets the job done."}
{"text":"This location can be crowded and long, but whenever Mikayla is at the drive thru it goes by faster. She is always so friendly, and patient. It is clean, and the staff is accommodating and kind. I think giving them a bad rating, because of the long lines is ridiculous. All the Starbucks locations take awhile especially during peak times. If you are in rush order in advance, walk in, or find a time to go when you don't have time constraints."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is, but out of all the Starbucks in our area, we always come back here and have a great time. Friendly, fast, not many mistakes. And the baristas are always really fun and friendly. My absolute only criticism is for the dark haired male manager who, instead of correcting his staff privately, berated them in front of a bunch of customers and called them unprofessional, loudly. My starbucks tea was tasty as always, but that left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Only two employees with over 15 people waiting in line. So needless to say service was slow. I understand the concept of a 'captive' audience and much higher prices, but I expect management to use a little bit of those higher prices to provide adequate staff and therefore adequate service."}
{"text":"I always go to this Starbucks either before work or to study/do homework for graduate school. Great atmosphere and staff"}
{"text":"This new Starbucks sucks. The drive thru ALWAYS has such a long line. The service is terrible. My order is the same everytime, a green tea frappacino with non fat milk , no whip cream and an extra scoop of matcha powder. As you can see my order is very very detailed and each time I ordered it they MESSED UP! Oh and let me just add that the parking lot was also terrible, its full of pot holes!"}
{"text":"When you are paying over $4.00 for a drink, you expect it to be right. It RARELY is and at least half of the staff has been beyond rude if I speak up because they made it wrong. I would NEVER visit here if it was not so close to my work. The absolute WORST Starbucks"}
{"text":"Lovely Starbucks where the staff is really friendly. They do have wifi so if you need to get online and post your reviews you can with ease.


 The store was a bit mucky when I was there so they lost a star but really fab staff who were superfast with my drink.


 Great experience!"}
{"text":"I agree with most everyone else, this location is very slow and the staff is not the friendliest, drive thru is awful. Alway so many people behind the counter and I'm never quite sure what they are doing. I always order a cappuccino and it's been inconstant each time. It's the closest location to my house and I prefer to drive to the Stephanie/Horizon Ridge location, where they actually know what they are doing. That place gets slammed and they manage to keep the lines moving with a smile!"}
{"text":"Spacious but ccccold. Asked to turn up heat but worker said I have to contact head office. When I did; I got no response. 

Also, there is only one bathroom working. Really need Starbucks to fix these issues."}
{"text":"A Starbucks without wifi (as of April 27, 2016) isn't really a Starbucks. Everything else is typically Starbucks-ian in nature."}
{"text":"Lots of room and great location but the service is extremely slow and some have terrible attitudes. Looking for another place to go. Starbucks needs to fix this location."}
{"text":"This store has gotten progr progressively worse they keep on changing staff it looks like and there's barely anbody working but they're very slow and the orders are not always correct it takes forever even with the mobile order let alone if you walk in regard to the drive-through forget it it'll take forever I hate coming to this location but Unfortunately it is the only one in this area"}
{"text":"Never coming back again.  They were out of all the coffee drinks I get .  What's most sad is that she didn't even care to ask if I wanted anything else she just gave me a total witch was my husbands coffee  and forgot to give us our receipt we had to ask for it !"}
{"text":"Every time I come to this Starbucks, I leave in a state of fury. Maybe it's just a function of when I visit the place, but none of the baristas ever move with a sense of urgency.

I've missed a multitude of buses by stopping for a coffee here.

I've only ever seen two people on staff, and they've got all the time in the world.

This is not a place you pop in on the way to elsewhere."}
{"text":"They have some really great regular staff here. Friendly and sincere. Yet recently, it seems they have some new managers who are loud, eerily cheery, somewhat shouty with their friendliness, and both of whom call everyone \"hon\". I know that is what is expected of them by the senior, or general managers, but I prefer a friendly smile and a \"what can I get for you\" instead of \"HI HON! How are YOU today???!!!!!\" I just want to order a coffee. I don't want to chat about my life and yours. And the customers that DO, will do so regardless. Maybe my age and my years in the service industry has tainted me but over-familiarity used to be found a bit garish and its difficult for us introverts.  I stopped going here for my early morning coffee to avoid this.  I now just wait and go to the one near Broadview station, breaking the habit of never carrying coffee on the streetcar to now grabbing one on the way to work.  The staff at this location are friendly but don't seem to WANT something from me. I've only once accidentally splashed a drop of coffee on someone in the streetcar after a sudden jerk. But she was carrying coffee too so couldn't complain. I still would rather have my early morning coffee at home but can't handle the \"in your face cheer brigade at 6am\" at 605 Danforth."}
{"text":"Starbucks has completely fallen off. I stopped going to the one on Maryland, and I was hopeful when this one was built, but this one is terrible too. I will never go to Starbucks again unless someone else is paying, and I will still complain. Because it's terrible.

Here's what pisses me off every time:
1. Tips mean absolutely nothing to anyone working there. Whether you tip $0 or tip $5 dollars the people will give you a \"THEEEENNKS,\" but never make sure they get your order right or remember that you're the guy that tips.
2. If you go through the drive-thru, they WILL forget SOMETHING. They won't ever offer a drink carrier, a drink stopper, or they will make a drink completely wrong OR they will just forget to give it to you and disappear into the store.
3. They can't get your order right...ever. I get two very simple drinks: A short vanilla latte or a treinta Green Tea Lemonade with no sweetener. The latte's shot frequently is burnt, and the green tea lemonade will have sweetener 90% of the time, or it will have tea that has been steeped way too long or will be 90% lemonade with way too much ice. Is it seriously that hard to put two ingredients in a cup for $5??????
4. They value being \"cute\" and \"friendly\" over \"just do your actual job first.\" I don't need you to pretend to care about my shirt or my glasses if, after I gave a generous tip, you're just going to screw up the overpriced drink you made me.
5. If you call to make a complaint, the person will pretend to give a shit but then there will be absolutely no improvement and no one will recognize you as the incorrigible asshole that simple wants what he paid for.


You'll never get another dollar out of me, Starbucks."}
{"text":"I always stop by this location, and I find the staff quite friendly and the service to be quick. Sure, depending on the time, there may be a line, but that's to  be expected. Drink accuracy and good service means this place gets 4 stars from me!"}
{"text":"If your lead advertising is for a cold brew vanilla cream, you should be able to have it - just saying your out is rude and not a way to get return business - I'll get it somewhere else -"}
{"text":"The employees there are all super nice, always in a good mood - love em EXCEPT the tall lanky guy thats been there in the mornings the last few months - He's so bitchy and in fact spends so much time bitching about everything to his coworkers that half the time he gets orders wrong - Its too bad, really like all the others working there but I can't stand this guy so now I just get my coffee at the barnes & noble a block away. No bitchy guy there lol."}
{"text":"This Starbucks is in target inside square one.  The people that work here are very friendly. 
I came in the middle of the day on a Wednesday, so there wasn't a line which was great.  Get in and get out"}
{"text":"I'm always waiting a long time to get someone to give me my mobile order that I can see on the counter. Burnt and not the right amount of shots pulled. They keep getting younger baristas and they aren't always the friendliest. It sucks this is the only Starbucks on this side of town. They took my number once for a recovery card since they ran out and I never heard from them about that. Horrible customer service lately. They used to have a solid crew of baristas a few months ago. Debbie is the only nice one left. 

You guys are the only Starbucks on this side of town. Treat your regulars with care. I'm always a tipper as I'm in the industry and used to be a barista, but lately my coffee sucks."}
{"text":"Apple cider is nice and hot. But it is too sweet.  It is a good stop for such cold weather"}
{"text":"Ordered a sausage breakfast sandwich, iced vanilla latte and blonde roast. The sandwich and latte came out very quickly which I expected since there was not a long wait in line. Tasted just like any Starbucks in my opinion--which is exactly what I expected. 

Just a note, the prices here are outrageous. My latte was about $2 more than at a standard store, but that's just everything in Vegas..."}
{"text":"Ordered a Venti green tea latte and it was terrible. I basically got a glass of milk with a pinch of macha powder."}
{"text":"The staff is always frazzled here or always blissfully unaware of the rush and a sense of urgency. I have to come in 30 minutes before my shift starts down the street to be on time. Expect people to be cleaning when it's busy instead of making drinks. Expect minimal apologies for inconvenience. Expect to be told \"we are a busy stores you have to get used to it\".

I love Starbucks but this store is managed poorly and the general manager is always unnecessarily loud"}
{"text":"I frequent this location as it's on my way to work most often and the staff there is spot on each interaction. The drinks are consistent which can't be said for other locations.  They are upbeat and greet everyone genuinely.  Team members also treat each other with respect which you can observe while having your drink in the room. 

This Starbucks has my business for a long time."}
{"text":"Not sure why this location only has 2.5 stars??? I have read multiple reviews about the lack of customer service/friendliness at this particular location...totally opposite of what I experienced this evening at the drive thru...I did have to deduct one star though for being out of multiple things (not anyone's fault...but the soul wants what the soul wants!!!) but I received EXCEPTIONAL  SERVICE this evening from Mikey...what a DELIGHTFUL human being!!!! I will be visiting this location religiously now instead of the one on Stephanie...just in hopes that Mikey will be on the other end of the drive thru with his jovial self....thanks Mikey and team!!!"}
{"text":"My first visit was on a hot summer day. I ordered a grande add shot caramel frap, and I have to say the barista paid the utmost attention to detail when making the beverage! Gave a $2 tip because it is rare that a Starbucks baristas who are paid minimum wage pay this much attention to a drink.

On a more recent visit, I ordered something utterly ridiculous - a $12 drink. The three baristas were pretty good sports, helping me create the most abominable drink. 

These are just two of many visits where the baristas provided top notch service.

The accommodation was classy and quite roomy, albeit it tends to be full at most times. The wifi connection was speedy and does not disconnect."}
{"text":"A rather small Starbucks, but it's a homely joint nevertheless. The baristas are very nice and a Coffee Master works here. This location generally not busy, but is filled with students around 3 to 4. There is free wifi here, like every other location.
In all my times visiting this location, they only messed up my drink twice, but their great service 99% makes up for it."}
{"text":"Why is your drive through service so slow? I understand you're a busy location but so are most in the city, I hate coming through your drive through...  The one on St rose  in seven hills has friendlier, faster service get on top of it!!!! To top it off the drive through attendant drops my food before I get my hand on it and asked me if I wanted a new one? So there I am waiting another ten minutes while a car behind me honks!! I love Starbucks I'll always go to them but please pay attention and be accurate."}
{"text":"Honestly not a fan of their coffee, but the interior of this converted bank is quite cool.  Mid century accents and repurposed doors are used to decorate it. The lofty ceilings make in a nice place to relex and work on your next great report (or insightful Yelp review)"}
{"text":"Typical Starbucks. You'll get what you expect from any other location.
The location serves as a great warm up spot when marching through the downtown streets.
Staff was perky and friendly even after taking a horribly rude customer ahead of me."}
{"text":"I come here more often than I should because it's on my way to work. Whoever manages this licensed location did a bad job of training their employees. Nearly half the time they got my order wrong or charged me for a different (more expensive) item. This is literally the worst Starbucks I've been to. If you are here and have a feeling that what they charge doesn't seem right, it's very likely so. Check before you pay!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this location and MiKayla is the best!! My kids absolutely love seeing her smiling face to get our treats!"}
{"text":"As all of you guys who read this may know that there are tons of Starbucks to choose from, this is unfortunately not the one I would go back in the morning rush hour time. I am sure the majority of the cafe in the morning makes you wait, but I thought this was one of the place that took forever to even take your order.

However, the atmosphere and  store interior is clean and moderate volume. Once you order what you want, it will not take too long to get your product. Only thing that irritate me is the line that took forever to order the coffee."}
{"text":"I know for a fact you didn't take it literal. I know someone that works there in which I wont mention and she told me herself you guys where making remarks about me in which I wont goin to. This store lacks guidance from and adult it's typically always young people doing horseplay in the late afternoon. IE* Being loud, Running around and screaming. I have never in my life been to a store in the afternoons where the barista is the only cashier so if there is cars in the drive thru you have to wait 6-9 minutes to place and order after he is 100% done and never in my 300+ stores have I came in to contact with this idea. I even discussed this with a corporate manager that I know in seattle that works with starbucks and he said this falls on the shift and the manager and that another employee should have rung you up because we try to keep a certain time criteria of customers in que and pick up. I have had employees look at me and walk in the back every single time while waiting. I did not start timing my waits till the third time I came in after waiting for very long periods of time in a line that had no people in front or behind me at 7'sh and it took every time 6-9 minutes to take my order and yes one of them took just shy of ten minutes. This store has no people character nor does it have great customer service so far and there is no way to fix this with me. I understand this location is new but from what my friend said a majority of employees came from stores and know the common routines. I know a lot of people in our community and the one behind sprout's have also said some pretty nasty things about your store. Goodluck."}
{"text":"Can't live without coffee from Starbucks .. Long lines but service is fast"}
{"text":"consistently a terrible experience. i have been sitting in the drive thru without moving for 7 minutes.  there is no way it should be 12 minutes to get trapped in a drive thru before they even take an order. its always messy and the slowest starbucks ive ever seen by far."}
{"text":"Went to this Starbucks location this morning and my latte tasted horrible! My drink was so far from being a latte, I might as well asked for expresso in hot water...The person making my coffee (otherwise called a Barista, but that title is held with honor) is sooo far from being an average barista it's not even funny! Being a daily Starbucks drinker, this place is either tight with their mixes, poorly trained, or too much of being in a hurry that they don't pay attention to what a latte is supposed to taste like; or maybe a mixture of all three. I'm just glad I got a full refund and they can have their poorly made latte back. No Thank you! I will go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Obviously Starbucks management don't care about their service...all the comment and bad service from long long time ago still hasn't fix and/or improve. 
I myself experienced \"hard to believe\" bad service 2 days ago too. 
Manager was the one to start with....if manager act like that then how could you expect staff to do any better? Horrible service and horrible attitude. Wonder how they get thru a day working in that environment. Making yourself miserable been unhappy serving customer...sad. 
Never want to go there again.

Pricing is unbelievable as well. $7.50 for grande latte with caramel..."}
{"text":"Long line at lunch time but other than that, very friendly and tons of space. The baristas  are able to make custom drink."}
{"text":"A bit small for a average Starbucks store but it has great custom server with friendly staff as always. I have only been here once so i can't really commend about their skills but my coconut mocha coconut frap was awesome. However i think it is only available for a limited time only."}
{"text":"I love Starbucks!!!! U can never go wrong with a good Starbucks coffee in the morning to start your day. :)"}
{"text":"So it seams that Starbucks is so big these days that the drinks differ from place to place. The environment and customer service is definitely effected by how good the management is at each store. 

This Starbucks did a pretty good job. They've never burnt my coffee like some have and they've always been quick. They even deliver your coffee with a smile and say thanks for coming in which is nice! Some of those Starbucks get so crowded that the places seem to forget what customer service is! 

Thanks Starbucks! I'll be back for more caramel macchiatos!"}
{"text":"I've been to this  Davisville location 4 times and I've been disappointed 3 out of the 4. What prompted me to write a review was my experience today, the worst thus far: Only 2 other people in the store when I came in, 1 waiting for their drink & the other had just finished placing their order.  There were 3 staff members, and another on their lunch break. It was clear the guy making drinks was training.  After taking my order ( frapp with bacon breakfast sandwich) team member A at the register proceeded to stand there & chat with team member B while the guy training was left to make drinks alone.  I get my sandwich, 2 new customers come in. A takes the order & goes back to chatting with B.  New guy makes all hot beverage orders, ignoring the fact I was there before 2 others, then asks B  how to make my frapp.    Finally get my order after 11 minutes & as I'm leaving see the team member who was on break jump on the register & tell A (who is still just shooting the shit with B) to help with drinks.  I get outside, take a better look at my drink & can tell the consistency & color are all wrong.  Take a sip, disgusting, but no time to go back.  Get on the train, open sandwich that's now cold, take a bite & the bread is stale.  WTF? I'll stick to the Royal Bank location or go to the Tims across the street where 12 bucks will get me a lot further."}
{"text":"This Starbucks has very good service, fluent French and fluent English speakers, comfy chairs, as well as the other usual amenities. 

Really though, see the first review for the skinny on this Starbucks. It says everything there is to say about this location! Starbucks really are meant to be interchangeable (well, except for the location mugs)."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and clean location. Consistent Starbucks experience for food and drinks. Lots of parking on the street in this tucked away location."}
{"text":"The people are nice there which is great, but if you are EVER in a rush don't go there. I just waited over 30 minutes in the drive thru line and didn't receive more than a weak I'm sorry. Blamed it on all the hungover people from Halloween. And I heard them give the lady in front of me her order for free than had me pay for it. I waited in the same line as her for 30 minutes and I still owed my money for the lattes. Just poor customer service on top of the long wait. And even with the long lines I'm coming there at least 3 days a week. You think they would do more for their regulars."}
{"text":"Staff has always been polite and doesn't seem to mind students hogging tables for hours upon hours. 

Actually, as I write this review I realize this may be my favorite coffee house ever."}
{"text":"Sorry Starbucks but this location isn't for me! The employees are always running around like a mad dog spilling drinks as they go and never clean up after themselves. The ground is Always filthy so is the sick where they get their tap water to serve you. Yuck!"}
{"text":"The staff is always super friendly and have never complained for my sometimes elaborate drinks when I use my star rewards. I've gone both in the morning and the afternoon on weekdays and usually not much of a line up (2-3 in front of me at most).

Like everyone else says though, the place is small so don't expect to be able to sit and chill out.
It's just a block away from the subway so it's somewhat convenient."}
{"text":"Best staff ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Baristas are friendly and the store has really been looking great!!!!"}
{"text":"Everyone here is super nice BUT literally the morning shift are the only ones who know how to make drinks ! Every other time of day I go, my drinks always come out watered down or milky.  also they take forever @ drive thru most days"}
{"text":"S'bucks. You know what your getting nuff said."}
{"text":"I went to the new Starbucks in Square One by Club Monaco. The drinks were amazing and so was the barista who served my girlfriend and I. At first we were served by someone and ordered one drink and noticed that they had a promotion for new members to get a free drink, I had signed up and did not receive the promotion for the drink. We spoke to Rebecca who was really busy at the time and she was able to assist us in a timely fashion and suggested a drink in which I've never tasted (but was amazing). I don't normally write reviews, but she offered great customer service and will now be a loyal customer to the Starbucks franchise. Thanks again Rebecca."}
{"text":"This Starbucks is located on the main floor of the Atrium of SickKids Hospital. The staff are very helpful and always have a smile on their faces - a great addition to being fast and efficient!"}
{"text":"It took them a while, but these Barista's are on it. Though they've only been open for about 2 months, they are picking up and quite anxious to provide good service.

When first learning my drink order they stumbled a few times. Nonetheless they always offered to remake until they got it right. Kala and Sam are always super friendly (the other Barista's are too, I just don't know their names).

Just like the other locations I frequent, they know my drink before I order, making my visit expeditious."}
{"text":"You can finally satisfy your Pumpkin Spice Latte addiction with this new Starbucks on Mcgill street! The service is repeatedly excellent and the venue design choices make it very cozy, especially in the back sitting area. There are a lot of power outlets to charge your favorite mobile devices. The only real downside is the WiFi which is very unreliable. This seem to be a problem known by the staff since this summer but it is still not addressed."}
{"text":"15 minutes to get my drink and muffin from drive-thru. Only 1 car in front of me. Please work on customer service. The employee even forgot my straw."}
{"text":"Horrible robot service. I asked to refill a tea with a new tea bag and they looked at me confused. Do they expect to give me just water? How about people want to refill coffee? I'm sure they give coffee not just water. Also, I ordered sandwich and stepped outside for 1 min while I was waiting. They just left the sandwich on the counter without telling me. That's fine. I waited 10 mins and I asked them and they said, oh you stepped outside. Oh yea, customer fault? Again, when I asked for refill and they told me to line up while there was only 1 person on the line. Great service. I would just say \"Sure, give me a min\". I don't blame them. Just poor customer service skills. I have sales background and I can see this customer service is a fail."}
{"text":"Best thing about this Starbucks is the people.We have 3 Starbucks in this area the one I'm reviewing is inside Safeway.The people are consistently nice,polite and their manager is a very nice person.Getting my fussy order is never a problem.Starbucks is also inside Frys,outside of Frys shopping center facing Baseline."}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time using the app, it was definitely convenient to order and pick up. When I got the window, they were out of the pour over coffee and couldn't make my drink I wanted. So she made something close, friendly service, but didn't like it. I got a sandwich and when I got home it was cold. All of this happened in a 10 to 15 min time from ordering and picking up, I live close by. Don't know if I will do this again. Maybe just ordering a simple coffee and not spending so much for something that is dissatisfying."}
{"text":"30 to 35 minute wait time everyday...losing my business, sick of it.

No one has time for this"}
{"text":"In which I ponder the approach to a review of a single location of a chain

Starbucks.... At once I loath it for what it has done to convince the general populace that \"gourmet\" coffee must taste overroasted and otherwise damaged, I must also admit that it provides a necessary public service that might otherwise be unavailable-- a predictably warm, semi-comfortable, passably clean environment in which to recharge your laptop and get free wifi. 

Well, it's also an acceptable place (I'm running out of adjectives that mean \"mediocre\") to meet up with some friends or kill some time, get out of the rain/snow/sleet if you are not a postal worker, etc.

Wait-- what am I doing, everyone already knows what Starbucks is, I mean my iPhone even autocorrects me when I don't capitalize the \"s\". How is that for ubiquity? It doesn't even capitalize the \"m\" in mom (don't tell my mother).

So basically the above is a semi-rant against the \"man\" ruining something that I think is \"cool\" and \"counter-culture\". I feel like a hipster. No wonder everyone hates hipsters.

Anyways, this location is nice and spacious, wasn't super crowded when I went (around 6 pm on a weekday), some comfy looking couches that I didn't sit in because I think it's weird to sit directly beside a stranger in matching couches.

They knew what a ristretto is, but only because there is a button on the machine that says \"ristretto\". 

And so, before I launch into my tired old rant against buying \"gourmet\" \"espresso\" from a barista whose entire training consists of locating the \"start\" button on a super-automatic espresso maker, I will end this review.

PS I will still come here 2 more times just so that I can become its \"Duke\" on my never-ending quest to dethrone the current \"Queen\" of Toronto."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. I come here once a week based on my schedule, but they NEVER make my drink properly. Iced soy latte- pretty simple- it's always VERY heavy on the soy. Sometimes I wonder if there is even coffee/espresso in the drink. Yesterday was no exception... I'm done with this place. Why is it that I always have a great experience the other 4-5 days a week that I get my coffee at the Rocky River (Detroit) Starbucks? (Thank you RR!)
Additionally, the drive thru/parking lot situation here is a nightmare. If you bother going to get a poorly made drink, consider parking on the side street."}
{"text":"OK for a Starbucks. It's very busy, which makes it noisy and the staff hurried. The furniture, especially the armchairs, are comfortable and a decent place ti sit and read."}
{"text":"Asian lady at window took my order wrong, was not friendly at all, asked for no whip cream, and she just wiped off whip cream and gave back my drink. I could've done this myself. Starbucks needs to train  their employees to take order and hire people with customer service. I'd rather give no stars."}
{"text":"this is my local store, the location is great, staff are o.k not as friendly as the one close to my work-northyork center- but this is the messiest, dirtiest Starbucks I have ever been, no matter when you go during the busy hours or during the day it's so messy, so dirty the bar to setup your coffee is always covered by coffee and milk. The floor is so gross. I took some guest from the U.S there yesterday and was so embraced.The floor was covered with coffee that they didn't bother to clean it tables were so ugly, empty used cups everywhere on the floor, tables, ... 
I hope the manager of the store read this and taking some action because the location is one of the best location in the city and one of a kind it is so sad to see how the people work there do not care to clean it during the day. if they are short on staff when it's busy is not the excuse the manager should find a solution for"}
{"text":"Stopped in on one of the hottest/humid days of the summer for my go-to drink, a Grande, Passion Iced Tea Lemonade. Well worth it!
The location is convenient, there's another Starbuck's down the street in case you miss this one. Nice atmosphere, not the super friendliest service, but not rude. Works fine for me."}
{"text":"Spacious and friendly. A good location to work from. Drinks are hit and miss depending on the barista, but I normally have good luck with the seasoned staff here."}
{"text":"Right on the lake in downtown Port Credit you'll find this lovely Starbucks. It tends to be quite busy, sometimes with lineups stretching out to the doors. The staff moves things along at a good pace and they're always friendly. One of the better Starbucks I have been to."}
{"text":"Busy store, but all SBUX are packed during peak morning hours. Mobile ordering is a blessing and helps to avoid the long lines

This is a training store. 99% of the staff is amazing and super friendly. You can always count on Denise (D-nice!) to be there with a smile and positive attitude."}
{"text":"Love the layout of this location that is quite unique compared to other Starbucks!  Its sort of hidden away so its not quite as busy as other locations in the area."}
{"text":"I feel so claustrophobic every time I walk in here because of the small and narrow space. The cash register is near the door so you half to walk to the back of the place as you squish your face and butt against people to find a space in line to order. 

The staff here is nice most of the time and keep the lines moving as fast as possible. Baked goods can me limited especially in the early afternoon on weekends. There are a few seats inside and a small outdoor patio during the summer. Drinks are made quick and properly and I've never experienced any mix-up here so far. The counter at the sugar/milk bar can me messy and gross at times.

This location is defiantly not a place to sit and sip, but a place to grab something and get the heck out fast!"}
{"text":"This Starbucks is located upstairs inside Indigo. They're tucked away in the back corner and filling up the bookstore with subtle and delicious coffee fumes.

The staff here is nice and they try to get their unorganized and long lines moving fast. I feel rushed sometimes here when I'm ordering. They don't have a lot of food options here, but it depends on the day. I've been coming here for years and rarely do I get a drink mix-up; even though a lot of people are here. I must say, that making drinks here takes longer compared to other Starbucks locations. 

They have a nice seating arrangement next to their coffee bar- warm colored, cozy, spacious, and they have a few arm chairs. Bar stools are lined across the almost floor to ceiling windows that face Yonge St and that bring in a lot of natural light. Consider yourself lucky if you can find any seat. It's almost always packed here no matter what time of the day."}
{"text":"Oh my God, fix your horrible seating scheme.  We used to come to this Starbucks frequently, but now we give up and go across the street to Purple Perk for their crappy coffee and bad service just so we can find a place to sit.  I know this awkward row seating is a trend, and I'm sorry you had to cave in to it.  It ruins the whole experience."}
{"text":"This Starbucks location is narrow and small. Generally clean inside and bustling with people. The line-up can get long and the place can get crowded. The seats here are close together and you're most likely not to find one.

The staff here is efficient, super quick and take orders correctly and make the drinks well. This location also has a small nice patio outside during the warmer months."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this Starbucks location.

This place is narrow and not so big. I love the interior here- clean, relaxing, has an artsy feel with warm brick walls, soft music, dark panels and big framed art work on the walls. My orders have always been made well and handed over to me quickly which I like.The staff here is friendly and quick at the cash which keeps the lines moving fast. From my experience, it's never too loud or crowded here and I've always managed to find a seat. 

Will continue coming back here."}
{"text":"i wonder if this particular location has some kind of regulation when is one should order coffee. i ordered my drink just pass 12 and they smirked and commented. 
this is the second timethey did. it's like.. cant order coffee passed 12pm-- must look super extra tired to order one. 
gaahh... maybe they only do it me."}
{"text":"My experience at this particular Starbucks was not a good one. It was early Saturday morning around 7 am. There wasn't much of a line in the drive thru, but I opted to go in and grab myself an iced coffee. I usually  order a grande classic iced coffee, nothing fancy and fairly easy to make. There was only one group of four ahead of me. The cashier was pleasant and confirmed my order. Then. I waited.... and waited.... and waited. What really got my blood boiling was that people that just walked in were getting their coffee before me! I waited almost 20 minutes for an simple, iced coffee! I was just about to say something, when I finally saw my iced coffee being made. It was so frustrating seeing my order get pushed back and everyone else's, along with the drive thru orders were being made before mine even though they got there after me. I have never been to any coffee place that has ever made me wait that long. I am only giving this place two stars. One for the size of the Starbucks with ample seating and the other star for the pleasant cashier. I would give it zero stars based on time, for how incredible slow it was for a simple iced coffee and being skipped numerous times. Next time I'm in the area, I'll go to a different Starbucks or take the drive thru which seemed to get priority over the patrons inside."}
{"text":"The only reason I come here is because it's the closest Starbucks nearby. I ordered a green tea latte today and somehow the guy made a green tea lemonade for me... I've experienced things like this before at other locations and they usually make a new cup for me. But today when I asked, the guy here simply gave me an \"oh.\" And walked away. Lmfao thanks man. Seriously, the service is so much worse compared to other places."}
{"text":"Great location for a taste of home while abroad. Quick, friendly service coupled with an exceptional interior design and layout. One of the better locations that is tucked away across the St. George TTC Station. Will definitely return for my morning latte! 

Ps. They have nice toilet paper!"}
{"text":"Very rude and horrible customer service! I will NEVER visit this location again. This place should get 0 stars, but Yelp wouldn't allow it."}
{"text":"seriously, why do i keep doing back to this location? constantly out of certain food products and the drive through speaker is like a bad movie and really hard to understand."}
{"text":"Everyone moves quickly and always gets my order right. My wife turned me on to frappacinos and well now this is our go to ! A caffeinated wife is a happy wife :-)"}
{"text":"This Starbucks has competent staff and they make the drinks correctly. 

However, I do not understand why the company put a tiny store across from a subway station near the University! The lines in here can be crazy and good luck finding any seating during exams. If you just want to grab a quick coffee there are quicker options nearby albeit perhaps not of the same quality."}
{"text":"Best Starbucks ever.  I am so used to big lineups at peak times, and getting tickets on my car.  As a SB addict, I found it easier to just leave a few extra moments in the AM and get my fix before heading to work.  If I get there earlier, I usually park (tons of parking) and sit and have breakfast.  No tickets!  Yay!  If I'm in a hurry, I simply use the drive-thru which is unheard of for a Starbucks!  But this is the burbs I guess and everything is different."}
{"text":"Close to home. I order from the Starbucks app and when in arrive it's ready. A really convenient way to avoid lines when I need coffee in the morning."}
{"text":"Oh Starbucks...what has happened to you?!?  This used to be the BEST place to stop for coffee and conversations. Take note....Vicki, Mel and Denise provided the smiles and fast, friendly service. Now, we are no longer welcomed with smiling faces. There are long waits in the drive-thru and at the counter. Service is slow and the staff is less than excited to be here. Please figure this out."}
{"text":"I have to admit that I'm not a fan of West Side establishments in general.  They are so corporate and suburban as to make me forget I'm in Madison.  That said, this Starbucks fits right in.  Modern, sleek, overpriced, and uncomfortable.  Even the patrons look like they came out of a Lands End catalog.  Altogether generic.  But if you need coffee and you happen to be in the strip mall section of University Ave., this is what is here."}
{"text":"I'm surprise that people still go to this Starbucks location. Like previous reviewers have said, this Starbucks location is dirty in that their serving stations will have spills on the counters and no one wipes them down. These are not just water spills left on the counter but coffee, tea, and milk spills that are not attended to.

I have also seen at least 5 or 6 staff members behind the counter and only 2 (or sometimes 1) of them are truly working and making the drinks. I understand that sometimes those behind the counter are there solely to take drink orders while a few others are solely the barista. However, if you are not taking orders, then you should be wiping down the counters instead of chit-chatting doing nothing or maybe you could help your barista fill those coffee orders. 

Lastly, like others have complained, the service is very slow. I have waited at least 15-20 minutes for my ice coffee with heavy whipping cream. Again, this probably wouldn't be an issue if their staff would help out."}
{"text":"Worst service, the people that work here are so slow every singe time, the people here aren't pleasant. I don't think I'll ever be back to the Starbucks on Queen Mary. and I am a daily Starbucks client."}
{"text":"They are super happy and always great me with a cheery smile. A little slow making drinks and getting food but overall a good experience. The first time I went here I couldn't find the door, it's hidden on the corner."}
{"text":"Another Starbucks with the expected mediocre coffee.  The thing that makes this location different is that it feels like you're in a cottage or boat house when you're here.  The interior has a nice atmosphere with the exposed beams and huge cushioned arm chairs.  

Disclaimer:  if you're coming here for a quiet place to relax and read a book, go elsewhere.  This location is always busy because Running Room participants and cyclists like to congregate here after their workouts."}
{"text":"You know I went away from starbucks and started doing the whole \"local only\" coffee thing. Now all the local shops are brimming with hipsters, subpar caoffee, and service that comes with a \"Im too cool to be doing this\" attitude. After visiting a number of shops on my month long trip here I finally broke down and went to starbucks. It was almost empty. score. The girl who helped me was wonderful. She smiled at me, looked me in the eye, and when I asked if there was added sugar in a tea she said she didnt think so but to hold on a minute so she could get it for me to look at. She brought out the whole box for me to exam. On top of that the coffee was amazing. It was better than the other 4 local shops I had gone too."}
{"text":"No stars for this Starbucks... not well maintained at all!  Trash is always over flowing, floors are always dirty, very poor management!"}
{"text":"Coffee from this Starbucks is awesome every day, and the drive thru line is always very fast."}
{"text":"I'm here practically everyday! My new addiction... I get the Evolution pressed juices and have them blend it with ice in a Venti cup! There's so many flavors to choose from too! So good and refreshing on a hot summer day!!! & not to mention good for you too! @evolutionfresh"}
{"text":"Yeah I can consider myself a coffee lover for over 40 years and I can tell you that generally Starbucks is quite respectable.  The coffee quality is one thing but service and the staff really can make a simple purchase an even better experience.  We went in for a dark roast medium.  The server, James, didn't give me any grief over me saying medium vs Vente or Grande or whatever they cal it.  Just took the order and said that coffee was just about done and asked if he could leave a bit of room for milk or cream.  Sure  thanks!.   While I waited for the brew, I walked down the counter and found Daniel who happily asked if I could be helped.  I asked if I could get a glass of water. Yes of course,  and would you like some ice.  I know this sounds simple but we had just come from a restaurant where we spent a lot more than 2 bucks on a meal and service was pretty sloppy.  I asked if they used filter water.  Yup,  have to for the coffee.  I do like my water so it better not taste of chlorine and this was not a disappointment.
The coffee was very good as usual but I had to get some extra water cause it was great and Daniel was happy to oblige.  You have to realize when  you are in this kind of business that the little things really do set you apart and clearly these guys got it.  Great job."}
{"text":"Best starbucks i have been too! They always get my order right...they are super fast...and when they run out of a food item they always offer something similar to what you were gonna get! 10 stars! Great job!!"}
{"text":"This is my home away from home. I don't like that there is almost always a wait for coffee so I usually do an online order and pick it up. I almost never get a bad coffee! Plus the staff here is usually super friendly!"}
{"text":"Compared to other Starbucks Stores very clean and very friendly staff.
The drinks were excellent and the staff was very helpfull and polite.
Prices are the same as in every store."}
{"text":"This is the Starbucks the others should be taking notes from. The staff is always so friendly and easy going.And I'm not sure what they do to their drinks here but, they are way better than what I have had at some other Starbucks, I have driven past other SB's just to get to this one"}
{"text":"Okay, I LOVE LOVE Starbucks but this location gets my order wrong every time! Each time i go back thinking it will be better it's not. Not to mention, the staff looks like they just rolled out of bed and went to work. I don't typically share reviews but i am beyond frustrated with this location."}
{"text":"There are so many flies at this location! On the walls, hanging out by the cream and sugar, and flying around. I've been there twice and have noticed so many. When I went to put cream in my coffee last week, I disturbed about 50 fruit flies. Gross!"}
{"text":"I was in area today and was in serious need for coffee. Oh look! How convenient, this starbucks is right across the street from St. George's subway! 

Right when you walk, you'll notice it's not your typical starbucks. It has a really homey feel to it. There are tons of couches. Then, it'll lead you to this hallway-concept and there you can order your drink. The baristas here are very efficient, but not chatty like all the other Starbucks I usually go to. Which can be a good and bad thing for me. 

Overall, this location would be very nice to just sit in and enjoy your drink. It's pretty quiet, so you can probably do work as well! 

I will be coming back to this location when I'm around the area! I was never a fan of the big on bloor past avenue road, under Winners."}
{"text":"If you want to wait at least 20 minutes in the drive though line then this is your place. Either they need more staff or the staff needs to be trained to work at a faster pace. I've been inside too and it takes just as long. If the lines were out on control I could understand but 5 cars in the drive through and 25mins to get coffee is beyond ridiculous."}
{"text":"Nice to finally have a Starbucks in the neighbourhood, but they have some *serious* drive-thru logistics to work out.....  I've waited anywhere from 5-10 minutes for my drinks, regardless of the fact that there's never been more than 2-3 cars in front of me....  You pull up to the window, and you watch them starting to make your drink, and you wonder \"why weren't you making it while I waited in line?\".
The customer service is friendly, and they try to make idle chitchat at the window while you wait.... but hopefully they can pick up their efficiency just a bit.  In the meantime, it's WAAAY faster to go inside."}
{"text":"Ordered a hot green tea latte. Pretty bad, all green tea was clumped at the bottom. Garbage was full the entire time I was there, trash all over the counter where the napkins were. No paper towels in ladies bathroom. Quite dirty. Tables were sticky. Not returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"this was the worst starbucks ever.  the music was very loud and there were 8-9 staff members three of which were sitting at a near by table laughing and joking around so loudly i couldnt even hear myself think  
i ordered a smoothie which tasted watered down. 
its safe to say that i had a really bad experience and i will not be returning."}
{"text":"Service here is almost good but had a quite terrible but funny experience because of a crazy man coming in who took his shirt off and started talking to everybody and yelling that he doesn't have a girlfriend and that he's getting hot, reason why he took his shirt off. Employees did something about it but took them a few minutes before doing it."}
{"text":"I stop here every morning on my way to work.  The staff are very friendly and have my drink ready before I get to the counter.  It is always clean and I've never had any issue here at all.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I would go as far as to say that this particular Starbucks is like a second home to me. The atmosphere, the people, and especially the masterfully-brewed drinks contribute towards this place's everlasting marvelousness.

Usually, I am here either to socialize with my friends over some coffee, or to get some serious work done for school. In either scenario, I find myself getting the most out of my time here. The baristas here are super friendly, but also super skilled. They will whip up concoctions beyond your wildest dreams. The beauty of this place doesn't start at the drink, however. As soon as you walk in, I assure you, the first thing you will notice is the modern, clean, artful renovation recently done. I'm here a lot, and I have never seen a speck of dirt in this place.

If you enjoy coffee, tea, or any sinfully good beverage that tingles your tastebuds in the most fantastic way, you can't go wrong here. This Starbucks transcends others - a super-Starbucks if you will."}
{"text":"Love this Starbucks!

It's brand new, has an outdoor seating area and a nice intimate feeling inside - with lots of seating.

Service is great too. All workers are completely bilingual. No moody anti-English hostesses like I've seen at other cafes in Montreal.

Oh and guess what, yeah, the bathrooms are spotless here.

I'll be returning to this Starbucks location. Very pleasant overall experience."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service! All of the staff are cheery and very kind at this location. They take their time with their customers while also being quick at the bar. 
I come here very often, though it is not the closest location to me, because of the amazing service. 
Thank you all!!"}
{"text":"Wow. The service was soooo slow. also they didn't have any chocolate chips for my double chocolate chip frappuchino. I highly recommend that management bring in more staff for this location because the two employees just isn't enough."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever had a bad experience with Starbucks until today. I was rushed to order (which is so unnerving) and didn't have a chance to think about what I actually wanted. Decided to try the new Berry Sangria shaken tea since it was the first thing I saw. I asked for a Venti and went to wait for my drink. The staff were making some sort of custom drink for someone they knew by name, so I waited. My drink was so dinky looking for $5+ and they gave me a grande. I said I had wanted a Venti and instead of offering to fix it for me and have me pay the extra, instead they just asked if I wanted to see my receipt. Not really sure how a 4.45 grande turned into $5.40 but okay. I would have honestly just preferred someone to ask if I had actually wanted a Venti (which I did) and rectify the order. Pretty sure at EVERY other Starbucks, even the obnoxious and rude customers get their order right or rectified if it is incorrect."}
{"text":"Better coffee than the location one mile North on Desert Inn.  In fact, I'm not sure what's going on at that location but it's been bad both times.

This location is fine."}
{"text":"Apparently you cannot order the traveler through the drive-through even though it does not state that anywhere on the menu and if you go inside to order the traveler the clerks get upset and sigh as though your an inconvenience to them.  No customer service."}
{"text":"Good crew of employees.  Drinks are always good and if something isn't the way you want it to be they make it right!"}
{"text":"So we went through the drive thru, granted we went to one of the busiest one near us. They claim to be the number 1 in the las vegas valley. Probably in sales! But not in customer service. Not only did she give me the wrong Chai Tea Latte. She gave me the wrong size in hot chocolate. No caramel in the  caramel macchiato. Sent it back to get a little more and still not that much! and she was so rude just taking our order! And had such a bad attitude afterward. She was rushing us to get our orders in. Even ones with LONGER lines, have so much patience. It felt like I couldn't look at the menu at all! I WAS HUNGRY! I was planning on getting a couple wraps too. So glad I didnt!

 I should not need to add more crap to my drink when I pay for them!!! not worth the money. Never going back to that location. Need to make the employees go back to Kindergarden to learn how to be appreciative about what they have. 

I never usually get upset from someone being rude. Because I know days can be off especially in customer service, and things happen. You dont know what theyre going through. But when she comes back at you with a grand attitude that makes you feel like your back in middle school 13 years ago. It's something else. 

Can they give us our money back?"}
{"text":"Very friendly and courteous staff. I was actually surprised by the great customer service. Had a soy hot chocolate and blueberry muffin. Both were quite good; pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Good location to go to if your driving cuz there is loads of free parking and if you need to study on a Saturday they are open late"}
{"text":"As a frequent consumer of Starbucks, I can honestly say without a doubt that this is the slowest I've experienced. It's small, always in disarray, and seems to be constantly short staffed. Unfortunately for me, this is the closet location to my house and thus I have just given up going here altogether. What's worse than waiting forever both inside and in the drive through? Getting your hastily made drink which isn't even top quality! 

Avoid this location!"}
{"text":"This is my hangout every two weeks. Convenient location inside Chapters with plenty of seating and wall outlets for laptops. They even have a long work table for solo work-from-cafe-ers. There is some outdoor seating, but it faces into a parking lot, so nothing much to enjoy on the outside. Drinks are always made just right and they have very friendly staff. Lots of regulars here so much be doing something right."}
{"text":"I completely agree with the person who reviewed above me- the manager is rude but I really like the front line staff. Very personable and give the real starbucks experience to each customer."}
{"text":"Cool location next to the Renaissance Hotel and next to the Higbees (Christmas Story) department store.  Cool location and view to drink your coffee but no AC super hot and humid inside.  Not sure if hours but were open at 0630 on a wednesday."}
{"text":"Drive thru with a high price. Worth it? Yes; sometimes. 
Its the closest Starbucks with a drive thru to Downtown/UW.
Really nice service here, even at 4:30a. The only thing against them is they're not always on top on receipts, lid-spill-stoppers, drink options (splenda/no whip/EZ Ice, etc). 
Not much of a selection of merchandise inside, in fact there's a pretty run down atmosphere to it. New menu: tinier food portions. No pumpkin bread or coffee cake? Its not unique to this location, but the new(er) Gold card just plain stinks. It's now 12 buys to get a free one with no physical notice, and they expire fast. It lacks value compared to the old system, but enough of that. 
The coffee here has gotten too pricey to not just do at home. That and the alkali-burnt taste that seems to accompany the new keurig-like machines in use have me busting out the Community Coffee Chickory roast, and I'm Lazy. Even moreso at 4am, when they open. Probably why I still frequent here.  Convienence is king."}
{"text":"I love this Starbucks! The ladies are always so friendly and attentive. They tend to never mess up drinks but if that does happen they are so awesome about fixing it. They get familiar with their regulars and that makes us feel like more than just another customer that gets forgotten like other places. And even though it gets crazy busy in the mornings they manage to have you in and out in a reasonable time."}
{"text":"One of the most apathetic and lethargic Starbucks I have ever visited. I don't know how a purveyor of caffeine beverages can have such glacial service. I have been here for two conferences back to back and it is always this way. A line of less than 15 people took thirty minutes to get through."}
{"text":"I was very impressed when I walked in. It's a new Starbucks and I love the layout. It's very spacious and lots of room to sit here and there. The seating is different in each section. If I was a student, I'd be studying at this Starbucks. It's very open with lots of windows which I like. The drive-thru was EXTREMELY busy but I wanted to go inside and check it out. The service was good and so was my coffee."}
{"text":"Understaffed and super slow. Prepare for a long wait if you visit for a morning coffee or a snack."}
{"text":"Workers very rude     No even a clue of customer service!  

Bad service from the fat bald guy!  

Sad very sad !"}
{"text":"This Starbucks is the worst we've ever been in. We walked in and there were two people behind the counter, one sweeping the floor, and no one greeted us, even as we stood at the counter watching the help sweep, still no greeting. Finally I said, excuse me, can we order. The guy casually approached us, still no greeting. We finally decided, you know, we'll take our business elsewhere where we feel valued, and left."}
{"text":"A great starbucks location, 5* for the service.  At first, seating seems limited, but there's a whole 2nd level with lots of seating.  Great place to get some quick work done."}
{"text":"Great little store with an awesome crew! Love my lattes, dark roast and frappuccinos from here.

Yes, this is the busiest drive-thru in Vegas so of course there's a wait! To the people complaining about waiting in their car in the drive-thru, first world problems. If you're too lazy to walk into the store and/or you ordered anything but drip coffee, you're going to wait for your drink and food. If there's a long line, yes, those people in front of you get their orders first. It's not rocket science."}
{"text":"This newly renovated Starbucks on Avenue Road near St. Germaine. Is a coffee lover's paradise. I like the new decor. It wasn't like this a long time ago. The lattes are great as always. The service is great too. They are also liquor licensed. They serve beer and wine. It's on a busy strip of Avenue Road. A lot has changed on Avenue Road ever since. I really like the lighting, tables, chairs, coffee bar, and the food. It's a very high end Starbucks that will keep you having your coffee there time and time again. Awesome place for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Great place to bring friends and your co-workers. The atmosphere is just beautiful."}
{"text":"Asking for non fat milk is not a trick questions!  

They only had whole milk.  On a Saturday morning!"}
{"text":"Rude barristas... SB get a corporate quality person out here... drinks are extra pricey, so you might like to not be reaching across a filthy bar of whip creme mess to get your coffe, and barristas scolding for the misunderstanding over drinks they never call"}
{"text":"Located just outside door 4 of Sherway Gardens, staff is extra friendly at this location. They make a mean iced tea and passion cold beverage.  This location is becoming more and more popular. The recently rearranged the interior to add more seating."}
{"text":"I love the convenience of Starbucks! And I love knowing that the quality of my order will be the same each time I go. I also like sitting on their patio that looks onto University Avenue."}
{"text":"Great staff....If you stop by ask for Joanna, best barista in Vegas. I' finally got my chunky monkey frap...she looked up the recipe for me ."}
{"text":"I have to say I'm very disappointed.
I have used mobile ordering twice for coffee with espresso shots. I pick up the coffee and realize they've forgotten to add the shots! Do they even read the order! It's unfortunate since it's the closest starbucks to me but I have to go to a different location now."}
{"text":"Delicious, always fast. This was my favorite Starbucks downtown (before Oxford Centre opened). The baristas are great and the manager runs a tight ship. It is located in the Omni William Penn lobby, but I always enter through the street doors."}
{"text":"Friendly baristas. Service was quick: started my drink before i actually got to the counter. Had a Starbucks promo code via my app, and they didn't need to see my phone to verify it. Quiet and decent sized, also with outdoor seating and drive-thru.  However, they close at 7pm or 7:30 pm depending on the day. Minus another star for sticky syrup-topping running down along the side of my macchiato which would've been all over the inside of my palm had I grasped the cup differently."}
{"text":"This location is relatively new, and they are 24 hours.
I have gone there multiple times to get some work done.
The staff are always friendly.
With the green rewards program you can get unlimited refills :)
The seating arrangement is also good.
Plenty of parking available (which is rare with most Starbucks locations).
I moved away from the neighbourhood, else I will visit this location over and over again."}
{"text":"The new Starbucks @ 117th and Clifton

1) you're parking lot is inaccessible when the drive thru line is long.   Sometimes there will be 4 to 5 open spaces and no way to get to them because of the drive thru line blocking the entrance.   Can this be fixed?   Give up a space to gain better entry

2) Your people are now expected too do too much.  Now they accept orders from drive thru, in the store and online.   They make drinks and heat up food.  Service has become extremely slow.   Add people so they can keep up or eliminate an unpopular service.   

3) there is no longer an outdoor space.  So now there's no stopping on dog walks because there's no place to keep the dog safely while I'm in ordering.

Missed are the days of the Starbucks two blocks down with quick service and easy accessibility."}
{"text":"This has to be my favourite Starbucks in the city. It feels like you've stepped into a classy historic building with high ceilings and antique fixtures. It can be busy, but not nearly as insane as some of the other downtown locations. It's quiet enough to study with a delicious beverage by your side. 

The staff are your typical SBux employees - friendly, funny and welcoming. I've had great drinks made by the baristas - no issues yet. 

I regularly order the blonde roast coffee, which has always been great. Once in awhile I will spoil myself and have a frappucino - the green tea frapp is amazing! 

My only complaint is that the washrooms can get rather dirty and left without toilet paper at times."}
{"text":"Crappy attitude Batistas is this location's downfall. Your people determine your stores clients willingness to return to this location."}
{"text":"One of the nicer looking Starbucks locations I've been to in the City. It airy,  due to the high ceilings and the floor to ceiling windows. The layout is unconventional from the norm it's very urban.

It has an array of seating selections available from comfy leather chairs, tables and chairs to upright bar stools along the perimeter.

The place scores extra points for its cool urban layout and it's sheer convenience of being so closely located to the St. George subway station."}
{"text":"To be honest I just expect more from Starbucks.. Drink was watered down, no venti water.. Well there is for 1.50$ drinks are more expensive and you will have to wait in line"}
{"text":"I've become a bit of the Starbucks junkie, darn you Gold Card Status!! #effectiveloyaltyprogram

That being said I find that this location is in one of the nicest spots I've enjoyed my drink, but loses out from the fact that it is disconnected from the main bar. The main seating area is hidden from the staff's view and suffers from neglect.

Although the layout of the store is a major negative, the geographical location and the interior design of the store make up for it. Being right across from the presto equipped side of St. George Station is a major plus for commuting students. The interior design of the location is very comfortable with the heavy emphasis on wood accents, definitely a location that I will come to enjoy more often.

One note, the tables are fairly small so groups larger than 3 will have major issues finding space for themselves."}
{"text":"Like this location since it's tucked away in a less crazy busy location (unlike the one at college and yonge). I seem to have had a better experience than most with this location.  Seats are usually readily available. The free wi-fi is a always good, and there's nothing negative to be said about this location's service or drinks. all in all, a big thumps up!"}
{"text":"I have always loved Starbucks! Ever since they got the app and you can load money and earn point on there, it's made paying so much easier. I love the rewards, I just love it all. Well today I used the mobile order for the first time. Wow, just wow! I was actually able to get a coffee before work and not have to worry about being late to work. The best part I didn't even have to leave my house any earlier then I usually would. Let the same time, made my mobile order, went inside and grabbed it and continued heading to work. It was amazing! I will definitely be using the mobile order more often now! I'll probably get to enjoy a Starbucks coffee more often during the week now. Thank you Starbucks! You have of course upped the standards again!"}
{"text":"Great location, great atmosphere, great staff - HOWEVER - NEVER buy any of the STALE/day old croissants/sandwiches or any of their baked goods. Cheaper and FRESHER from the Tim Horton's across the street."}
{"text":"Slow service.  Got drink wrong.  Iced black tea unsweetened.   No apology and waited again to have them literally pour tea over ice.  How hard is you job.... Not hard.  Not hard at all."}
{"text":"Somehow this location regularly makes me get to work late cause of their slow employees.pulled up to the widow, paid for my drink waited five min at the window..cashier turned around and tells me my total but,that total was for the person behind me ,i  told her it's still me,I never left lol
Finally got my order and of course I get the wrong size so waited and waited again"}
{"text":"If you're out of a drink product tell me, don't swap it out with something and hope I don't notice.
Ordered and paid for sugar-free syrup in my coffee drink but when I tasted it (scalding hot btw) it didn't taste how I normally get it any other Starbucks. Asked if they maybe they missed the SF syrup, the employee proceed to tell they are out of the SF product so they just put one pump in of the regular (with sugar) product. Astonished that they thought I wouldn't notice and that was an okay swap?! Had to ask for plain coffee without getting refunded on my up charge for syrup too.
Poor service, poor communication, and poor judgement."}
{"text":"This Starbucks is always extremely busy.

This Starbucks is old and breaking down.

This Starbucks has a motley crew of customers: office, retail, 905ers, Yorkvillers, hipsters, and more.

This Starbucks has a self-serve water tank.

This Starbucks has WI-FI that only works 50% of the time.

This Starbucks has excellent employees and excellent service."}
{"text":"The people who work there are great and they make the best coffee there, that's why I keep going back"}
{"text":"Stores like this are why Starbucks has a bad reputation. Slow, rude, don't make drinks to standard. Terrible"}
{"text":"Sometimes i hear that people says that \"Starbucks\" is not good as early but i always get my coffee from here. Very good coffee and specially the latte is the best. Staffs are pretty helpful and very attentive. Plus point for a work."}
{"text":"this is one of the smaller starbucks I have been to, but there are plenty of spots to enjoy your drink indoors and outdoors. There are a number of outlets if you need to plug in and the service is always great. during the lunch hour, there is a huge rush of employees from the surrounding businesses, especially enbridge. 

I have gotten to know some of the baristas since I first started visiting this location, and they are some of the most friendly ones I have met!"}
{"text":"Slowest. Starbucks. Ever.  I've been in the drive thru 10 minutes and only progressed one car length.  It's slow inside too, no matter how busy."}
{"text":"This morning, I used the app to order ahead a coffee and chicken salad sandwich.  Even though chicken salad is a cold sandwich, and marketed as such by Starbucks, the counter staff heated it up.  By the time I arrived, it was hot mess of oozing mayo in the bag.  It looked disgusting.  You don't heat chicken salad.  Staff were apologetic, but had no more sandwiches, and the only way to get a refund was to stand in line for a cash register.  

The problem with this outlet is that staff are very badly trained. Staff seem to be trying very hard, and are always very friendly, but they haven't been given the tools they need."}
{"text":"Most pretentious Starbucks in the city. Still a great spot, also quite large."}
{"text":"OVERPRICED!!! What a rip off!

Regular coffee in a very well marketed logo cup. That is what Starbucks coffee is all about. Take a way the brand name and you might as well drink Sanka. What the hell is the deal with the tip cube???? You want your employees to make more money. Then raise your prices because I am not tipping someone just for selling me coffee. Make your own cup of coffee at home or go to a gas station. Not worth the $$$$$$"}
{"text":"This is the slowest most unfriendly Starbucks I've ever been to. I travel to Pittsburgh a lot and stay in the Westin. I was excited a SB was opening in the building but it always takes forever to get a latte. There are always people behind the counter but they move like molasses and are not friendly at all. This brand is really going downhill."}
{"text":"This location is a bit out of my way, but it is definitely worth the detour! I love the environment and the employees.  The employees are so friendly and will do anything they can to ensure you're getting the drink you want. Even if you don't know the exact Starbucks lingo of \"tall, venti, light, etc.\" they go out of their way to guide you with the ordering. The drive through is very convenient when in a rush, although I normally prefer to stay inside and read a book or study while I'm there. The decor is beautiful and I would highly recommend this location to anyone I know. :)"}
{"text":"I come here often on my way to work or on my break from work.  I have never been impressed with the service, but it is the most convenient Starbucks location for me. The baristas are never very polite and definitely not helpful.  There are always several workers just standing there while I wait excessively love for my drink and food. I don't even mind bad/slow service as long as I'm treated well, but I don't get good service or treatment at this location.  I will wake up even earlier to make sure I have time to go to a different Starbucks."}
{"text":"Love that this is a fast convenient location to me in my way to work! They always give my fur baby a pupa-chino as well!!!"}
{"text":"Good location. Near uptown so it's a short walk to the restaurants. But it's always too loud and takes a while for your order bc it's always packed with people. 

if you're looking for REAL coffee, just walk 5 mins over to Rising Star. They serve legit coffee and the cafe vibe is better."}
{"text":"My tea was delicious and so was my boyfriend's cafe vanilla frap, but it was so cold in there that we wound up leaving and sitting outside in the warm car to drink our beverages. There were also only two comfy seating options. If you are just running in to pick up a drink and dash, this will be a 5/5 experience. If you are looking to stay and relax and enjoy your beverages, I'm sure there is another starbucks within a few miles with better heat and comfier seats."}
{"text":"I stop here for a coffee whenever I have to kill time waiting for a Porter Airlines shuttle to the Island Airport.  It's standard Starbucks fare, which makes it a decent-enough place to hang out.

Free wifi, nice little patio.  Look out for the always-sticky-dirty wooden tables near the windows, though.

Update: Within minutes of posting this, an employee wiped down the table beside me.  Well played, universe."}
{"text":"I frequently go to Starbucks and I am a bing fan and the baristas are usually very pleasant and kind! Unfortunately I had a bad experience with a barista when she made me the incorrect drink. I had ordered it iced and she made it hot. It's not a big deal and I said to her \"oh i am sorry, it was supposed to be iced.\" She glared at me and then dramatically dumped it down the drain, clearly annoyed. Then she proceeded to make it iced, and hand it to me totally unmixed and just thrown together. It was very rude and made a lasting impression on me. Customer service is VERY important I have worked in this industry before. You don't have to go out of your way to be nice, but you should definitely not go out of your way to be rude.  I hate writing  bad reviews but and I know everyone has bad days- maybe this was a bad day for her. But when you are working try to be professional."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and always clean. Have not had an issue with customer service but it can get busy. Don't think I have waited more than 10 minutes from line to drink in hand... Maybe I'm just lucky"}
{"text":"Long line, slow service, I was not able to use my Starbucks app to pay, and the prices are HIGH!"}
{"text":"Really nice Starbucks with a raised ceiling and exposed wood beams. Nice view of the water and the fake Port Credit lighthouse. 

The reason I'm writing this review is because the chairs in here are the absolute least comfortable I've ever sat in. Remarkably bad. A bar runs into the top of your back like some medieval torture device. I'm not sure why they chose these, other than to encourage visitors to never sit down for longer than 15 seconds. So don't plan to sit down for a few hours to work."}
{"text":"This is the Starbucks closest to my work and I have to say it has greatly improved over the last couple of years.

The staff are friendly and are great at remembering regulars and their order/name. This wasn't always the case so the improvement is definitely noted. Their food is fresh and well displayed and the location is kept fairly clean. From time to time they have the odd staffing issue which can slow the line down but they hustle and do their best and keep the customers happy. 

This location rarely has the crazy line ups you see at other downtown locations too which makes it a reasonable destination even if you are crunched for time in the morning. I find their service is just as great in the afternoon as well if you are looking for a coffee or tea \"pick me up\"."}
{"text":"This Starbucks is oddly large for an inner city location. Which is nice...you fel like you can move around without stepping on someone else in line or bumping into a coffee mug display.

Stopped in here for an afternoon pick me up while doing a walk across the city (yes really(. We opted for smoothies given that coffee and long walks might make us feel gross. The boyfriend ordered a strawberry one and was promptly told by the cashier he should choose a different flavour. When we asked why, he said that he just prefers the orange mango more. Um okay. I ended up getting the orange mango and it was okay...nothing to write home about. Service was fast, washrooms were very clean and  there was lots of room to sit. Not a bad Starbucks in my books."}
{"text":"I realize there are plenty of local coffee shops in Madison, and I love them too, but this one just happens to be on my way to work AND it has a drive through. Sometimes convenience wins. It also happens to have a super friendly and energetic staff that is always so kind and really brightens my morning commute."}
{"text":"Busy location!  This Starbucks usually has a line when you walk in, but they are generally pretty efficient in moving the line along.  Friendly staff.

My last visit, they actually made my order incorrectly, and they had no qualms in making it right for me.

They gave me my correct order and the mistake - to share with a friend."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the slowest Starbucks in the Southwest.  I write this review only after multiple times coming here thinking maybe it was just an off day. The staff isn't overly friendly and certainly do not go out of their way to greet when you walk in or even assist with a mobile pick up order.

today was extremely terrible as the wait was over 40 minutes long for some that had completed mobile orders and when one customer asked why they were told the drive-through was given preference treatment and all mobile orders were not being made until you checked in with them for pick up.

I hope this review will let management know what's going on in their store in hopes they can get things turned around."}
{"text":"Worst Starbucks experience - visiting from US (Rockville,MD) and if this is how Canadian Starbucks customers are treated, this store is an embarrassment 
for Starbucks! 

What went wrong- multiple things: 
1. Cashier accused the customer \"you said yes and ordered both!\" - what an attitude !! 
2. Lack of POS transaction experience  to issue refund! 
- lack of training ! 
3. When asked to confirm the order, refused to confirm to order - lack of basic communication and customer service in addition to attitude issue! 
4. Dirty trash all over the  front entrance and presentation of the store! Should be called homeless shelter -bucks! 

All of above, when I have asked for names of the barista, refused to give names and yelling \"you can have all!! 

Please hire better crew to run the Starbucks!"}
{"text":"By far my favorite Starbucks! I always go there every Sunday and Saturday morning before work through the drive thru and everybody is so nice and kind."}
{"text":"The drinks are super expensive here! Most other Starbucks on the strip aren't even this pricey so it's a bit of a turnoff unless you're really in the mood for some overpriced coffee. The worst part is they don't take rewards here as well. 

I can't complain about the service or the quality of the coffee so they earned another star there. However, I don't see myself coming back here. There are much better options for a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Service ok. Some mistakes but try to fix them without problem. Sometimes coffee not hot just warm. Good sometimes not too fresh. Same day made but done earlier I think. All in all an ok place."}
{"text":"As a person who  frequents this location, I really don't have words for how poorly run it is. Disappointed is understatement. I spend thousands of dollars at Starbucks but am seriously considering becoming a Dutch brothers customer. Please someone in management evaluate this location soon before you lose me and my staff as customers for good!"}
{"text":"Should have been open today until 10 pm, as per its sign and per starbucks website. Was closed at 9.15 pm already. Staff waved us away. Hate this kind of unreliability. 
Did they get payed until 10 p.m. by starbucks anyway?"}
{"text":"7.50 dollars for a yogurt, even the fact that it is inside a hotel doesn't excuse it . 
Everything is double the regular price , doesn't make you want to come back ."}
{"text":"A few things to mention:

- the sitting area gets very hot and stuffy in summer 
- personnel is mostly friendly with some exceptions
- gets a bit crowded near the counter with milk, caps etc - would be nice to either have it larger or have another one, so not to wait too long"}
{"text":"THE WORST STARBUCKS I HAVE EVER BEEN TO. The staff was just the in friendliest people I've ever encountered. It was slow as hell & this guy who took my order acted like I was a burden to him. He took like 5 years to make my drink, which was disappointing. There's a Starbucks in Target that's just a few more miles from my house, and I'd rather waste the gas to go there for better service."}
{"text":"This starbucks has really seen a change in the last couple months! As a Drive Thru customer, they really have changed their focus and my wait time in line has changed significantly. The baristas are way friendlier than before and I am happy the direction this place is turning!"}
{"text":"This is a very busy location, but for the size of the line ups, the service is quite fast.  If you can snag a seat, it's a good spot to jump out of the office for 15 minutes to reset. If you can't get a seat in the actual store there is a lot of seating in the adjacent good court."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience... I've decided to not support this location because they refuse to supply a free venti sized water... I can see your refusal to supply large waters to people who are not customers... But I just gave you four dollars for twenty cents worth of coffee and sugar and I waited ten minutes because your location is always understaffed. This is solely a complaint on management... Not hourly workers. Starbucks is a billion dollar enterprise... And they are refusing large waters to customers in the ghetto, if this was Scottsdale... There would be no problem. Shame on you guys..."}
{"text":"The team members at this Starbucks are outstanding! I came in with my family after a long day of traveling, with young kids that were being a little rowdy, and everyone was so understanding and accommodating. Thank you for making our experience so pleasant!"}
{"text":"Its  Starbucks
Great Parking"}
{"text":"Maybe the worst Starbucks that I have been in. No soap in the washroom.
No toilet seat paper. 
Floor where dirty
There was four staff. But they seem to be new. I was there at 1pm .
My drink was done right.
With the money that Starbucks makes all there stores should be top notch ."}
{"text":"There is never a time where Starbucks isn't a good idea. Caramel macchiato is the best. You just can't beat it. Thank you Starbucks for your amazing service"}
{"text":"Service was very friendly and fast.  I tried the very berry refresher drink and it was great!  We were in and out in less than two minutes.  I would come here again anytime."}
{"text":"Generally, I prefer to support smaller, independent coffee chains, but as far as Starbucks go, this one is great. The service is often quite friendly."}
{"text":"It's a people watching place! Motorcycles are parked on Front Street South,south of Lakeshore Road West on the eastside of road. There is parking in Starbucks parking lot off of Lakeshore Road West or Front Street South. Watch the pedestrians and traffic"}
{"text":"Holy Moly. This is one of the busiest Starbucks locations that I've been to. But they handle it well. A bit of a wait. What else can I say but it is a Starbucks"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would! Nobody in the drive they do I ordered my coffee and pulled immediately forward!  I sat for over 7 minutes and NOBODY even came to the window to take my payment or help/ greet me! I ended up pulling away without my order.  The inside only had a couple of people seated and there were less than 5 cars in the parking lot, so it's not like they were busy!"}
{"text":"I have been a patron of  Starbucks for MANY years and spent ooddles of money...yesterday was my breaking point  ..
I CANNOT have coffee , it makes me anxious ,  , messes with my anxiety, depresion , gives me racing thoughts , maks me gittery and messes with my ptsd. I have not had coffee in 2 years, let alone exspresso ....

 Yesterday I had money left on my Starbucks card , so decided I was going to be brave and try something new. I told myself it is the holiday season let go of my sugar fixation.
(NO high fructose corn syrup , corn syrup , dextrose. , Maltodextrin , or dextrin , tapioca syrup ).

So I ordered a Pumpkin Spice Latte , NO exspesso , just Almond Milk and syrup.

They could not find the bottle of syrup so they could not tell me what was in it.

As I started to drink it, I exclaimed to Robert this taste like there is  coffee in it.
I asked Atlas to try it , they said the same thing, 

I called the store. 10 min. later and talked to the Barrista who remembered my order, she talked to the guy who made it , who said .. NO there is no coffee in it. 

At this point my heart is racing , I cannot think or talk straight. And I am anxious.

I go to another Starbucks and explain what happened , they make another drink and look at the difference. 

I WAS right .. 

The caffine had a triggle effect , I was gardening for more time than I should have , got a splinter embeded so deep I cannot get it out and my finger is in so much pain  , my leg got stabbed it is purple and raw , 

Even though I the coffee eventually wore of a few hours later the racing thoughts I had from the  coffee , triggered not only my anxiety , but my manic phase of racing thoughts .. So I got no sleep. Less than 4 to be exact.

Starbucks did reemburse me for my order, and after talking to a friend , I don't want to get anyone fired , but they lied to cover there own ass. And the effects I had were NOT fun .."}
{"text":"Their coffee no longer tastes like vinegar and the staff has improved!"}
{"text":"Good coffee spot.  Beautiful, open, and very well lit space with plenty of seating.  A nice view of Mellon Square and connected to the Omni hotel lobby (another beautiful space, but more dimly lit.)

Good to get some work done.  Gets busy and a little loud.  Free google wifi.

I'm not personally a Sbux lover, but this is a solid option if you need some space to work for a bit and a hot drink.  Staff is friendly, too."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Cody was very friendly. My mom wanted her passion iced tea lemonade lightly sweetened and they did it just right. I was also very happy they gave us iced waters. This 110 weather was killing me!"}
{"text":"Not enough help here there were 2 people and a long line. I ordered a tall mocha frappe light, pretty basic. After waiting 10-15 min. I asked and was told your drink is there and she picked up a frappe with whip cream and some sort of sauce. I told her no that's not what I ordered. She asked the barista to make a new one, I watched as he stared a different order. I figured after a long wait I should cut my losses and I asked for a refund. Another 10 minute wait for the manager!! The manager refunded my money and asked if there's anything else I want to order. No way!!  Some of these franchises really miss the service mark, not up to the Starbucks standard for a $7 drunk."}
{"text":"A little frustrated... It's 6a and I count 5 employees inside the store, yet one person is making drinks. I'm the only person inside (the drive thru is full) and I wait 10min for a drink! Why is there only one employee making drinks when there are 5 inside the storefront?? I know the other employees can make beverages because I see an employee make herself a drink. C'mon starbucks."}
{"text":"Huge Starbucks with plenty of outlets. 

Staff was pretty nice and the restrooms were super clean!! Great place to hang out before going out to your festivities or chilling here instead of being at the bus depot."}
{"text":"Every time I come in here, I end up waiting 10-15 minutes for an iced coffee. Perhaps management should explore the idea of having more than one barista. This is such a poorly run Starbucks. Use some common sense and start treating your customers with some respect."}
{"text":"This Starbucks location is in the heart of Port Credit, right beside the landmark lighthouse.  Being in prime location, it is one of the busier Starbucks' in the Mississauga area.  I was there last night for a coffee date and the place was packed at 8:30pm.

Service was still stellar like in true Starbucks fashion, friendly, prompt and hassle free.  Luckily, I was able to find a spot outside on the patio.

It is a great location with pretty scenery day or night.  Stop by if you are in the Port Credit area!"}
{"text":"This is the Starbucks of all Starbucks. 

If you need a beautiful place to be inspired then this is it. The location has beautiful glass windows that overlook the marina and Lake Ontario. The decor has beautiful raised ceilings, exposed wood beams, etc. It's a great place to work (if you work outside the office) and an excellent place to meet with friends. It's often loud (as most coffee shops generally are) and is always quite busy. During the summer, they have a beautiful, large patio where you can often find local cyclists, runners, and families.

I didn't give it 5 stars because the service can be a little bit slow. The employees are nice enough, but often seem to enjoy talking to each other more than they enjoy serving their customers."}
{"text":"Ok so this is a Starbucks, for the most part, like any other starbucks. Specifically to this location, it is expectedly busier than most because it is right on University (hard to miss). Even so there seems to be plentiful seating and staff is efficient give or take some rare occasions. Now the real kicker. This Starbucks has a drive thru! Which is GREAT except that FOR the drive thru is the worst positioned store I have ever seen. People seem to think it is a free-for-all and whoever is closest gets to go; whether you come in through the back entrance or front  I guess its anyones go. Thats why this store doesn't get a full 5 stars. It seem like a tiny thing to worry about but the parking lot is awful as well."}
{"text":"I like Starbucks, this is my favorite location.

Decor is fine, typical Starbucks style. Not much to say, it's fine.

The drinks are, of course, excellent. My favorite is the Caramel Brule Latte. It's seasonal though, so Christmas time only. Many of their others specialty drinks are great as well. Their standard coffee is just fine too.

Service is always polite, but can sometimes take ages. If it's busy you can wait a long time for your drink. I think sometime around Christmas I waited 30 minutes. Mind blowing, but I wasn't in a rush.

It's good, it's worth a visit, especially if you're into that kinda' thing."}
{"text":"Great location - like the previous post, it's nestled away from the bustle of yonge/college and is not as busy as the Starbucks there. Ample seating for students and all the baristas were really nice. Could work on expanding hours but with a 24 hr location so close, it must be tough. Fabulous nonetheless!!"}
{"text":"I collect Starbucks coffee cups & have about 20 so I need a new holiday one of course.  When I saw that the Coffee Bean took over this Starbucks, previously located on the corner of Horizon Ridge & Eastern, I was sad.  Out of all the Starbucks, from the airport to Henderson, they had the best coffee mugs!  

But when I saw this one open, I figured it was the same one & it is!!  As you walk in, all of the coffee mugs are all individually facing you in their own lil cubbyholes.  Same as before.  Same nice people & a large more convenient seating area on the right.  The last location had a huge cozy & covered terrace, outdoor seating that was wonderful.  I actually wanted to sit there.  Now, it's small & narrow right in front of the doors, where you see traffic & the parking lot.

Zero stars for parking lot situation, but five stars cause it's better than the parking in the old spot.  Also five stars cause I don't go there to sit, I get my mug & I'm gone.  This time I got the draw your own mug, my second one & I love them.  Will share after it's baked.  My only complaint is that after a year the white paint turns slightly brown.  Starbucks corporation needs a note of this.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Looks great, nice staff, but open for a month and still no internet. They will lose business until it is fixed"}
{"text":"This is an above average Starbucks in my book. I have only done the drive thru twice on the way to my friends. This location isn't as busy as other locations and the service is quick. I was in line at 8:40 this morning behind four cars. I swear I had my order in my hands, right after I placed my order and checked in on Yelp.

Great location!"}
{"text":"Excellent as always! My favorite drink is iced vanilla latte but I've tried many. Service is awesome! Keep it up Starbucks! I've visited you from STL MO to Peoria AZ."}
{"text":"Even though this Starbucks is far away from home, I do end up waiting here a lot.  This location is convenient and there is lots of parking since it's located in a plaza.  

Agreed, watching people park is pretty entertaining as long as your car is parked safely far away.
Yes, seating is limited.
Apparently, half and half cream is also limited.  I hate it when they put out the cream that's near empty. 

I asked the barista for an Americano.
I order a lot of Americanos.
Often, I've asked for less water (at other Starbucks).
She gave me a whole spiel about how what I'm ordering no longer an Americano.

Ok, it's before noon on a weekend.
I haven't had my caffeine yet and I completely don't care.
I want my espresso.
I want it NOW. And I completely don't give a F*$%.

Here's the definition of a Caffe Americano off the Starbucks website:
In Europe, coffee is essentially espresso - which, in America, isn't very much coffee. To create a caffè americano - a coffee that satisfies the American preference for more sips in every cup - Europeans simply add hot water to their espresso."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst Starbucks. There are currently 4 people working and there is a line!! They can't handle the rush and drinks take a while to come out. Not to mention when they are finally made they are a mess!! My cup is filthy and it wasn't even filled to the top...wouldn't recommend unless you're desperate and willing to wait."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, fast service, and great atmosphere.  Definitely my favourite Starbucks.  Stop by and check it out yourself!"}
{"text":"In an exhausted delirium (induced by my 4 month old partying all night) I decided to swing through the Starbucks drive thru after leaving Sprouts today. I don't frequent Starbucks (I'm a loyal dunkin donuts fan) so I was kind of overwhelmed by all of the options on the menu and didn't want to hold up the drive through so ordered a venti ice caramel latte. Living in Arizona, aka Satan's armpit, I had to have an iced drink after lugging my 4 month old in his car seat with a 4.5 year old dragging behind thru the grocery store. The girl at the drive thru was super pleasant and asked me how my day was going. My drink, however, was luke warm, which was kind of disappointing but I swirled it around and it got colder. I'll try something different next time, although i probably will stick to Dunkin for my regular old coffee. Starbucks is pretty pricey!"}
{"text":"I've been to a few of these stores around town, and I've found that this one isn't one of the better ones.

The treats and food here often taste stale or just old. If you're here for coffee, you'll get pretty much the same as all the other Starbuckses,  but watch out for the cream/milk containers if you don't like your joe black --- even right after they open at 6:30am, they aren't cool at all.  Makes me wonder how often they're in the fridge, or how often they're refilled with fresh dairy.

Line ups here can be very long, but the staff is efficient --- they'll prepare your drink as you wait in line, and they'll treat you politely too."}
{"text":"A pretty regular starbucks. We got some coffee and some quick bites to go with it."}
{"text":"Drew was the barista that helped me. He was very friendly and knowledgeable! Sometimes coffee can be hit or miss but he did a very good job"}
{"text":"Always good service inside, the drive thru still have some work, it can be faster in the mornings. I come at all times during the day,  sometimes after work around 7 that's the only time sometimes I find the creamer thing empty, or the messy tables. But over all I love this Starbucks"}
{"text":"Starbucks should be ashamed of this location. My drink was missing Caramel drizzle and the barista told me \"ummm it's umm there I think\" and my drink was only 3/4  full. When I asked to just remake it they said no its perfect. That's not right, especially if you are spending $6 on a drink that should cost 3 at most. Do not go when a young, small blonde barista w/black glasses is working. Save your money!"}
{"text":"Went to this new location today and everything I ordered they didn't have, despite the big pictures of the special drinks all
Over their menu so finally I had to pick one of their regular flavored after repeating myself twice the lady still couldn't get it right so I just said forget it! Had to wait behind two cars to get the heck out of there. For a newer place you didn't meet the cut won't go to this location again!"}
{"text":"Starbucks store was clean people friendly open till 10pm. Nice place to just sit read and sip on your cup of joe. They offered me a free refill while the young lady was cleaning the store on her shift. All I can say not to many places will offer you that has a clean around you."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Spilt my drink by mistake inside and they cleaned it up and replaced it for free. Definitely recommend this Starbucks."}
{"text":"Employees were nice, only thing I didn't like was I ordered an iced mocha and I couldn't even get my straw through because all the ice."}
{"text":"This Starbucks has gone through so much, it's located in a very dangerous part of town, they've been held at gun point, they've been broken into, and they've been violently threatened before. If they're in a bad mood, don't ask why. Be surprised they're still there taking your orders. I once saw a homeless guy throw his dirty cup of ice at one of the managers cause he was going to throw the tip jar at her, but luckily she was able to get a handle on it before he threw it at her. It's not that they're I intentionally in a bad mood, some people just bring out the worst in you. And for a little above minimum wage, it's not worth going through all that."}
{"text":"The staff never seems to know what is going on. You cannot use the Starbucks app to redeem points. Very frustrating."}
{"text":"There are many Starbucks I've been to, but this one is a preferred favorite.

I've been using this place as a meeting spot for a long time - get-togethers with friends, business meetings, even the occasional date... you name it. Having lived in Port Credit for all of my life, this spot has some of the best views of the marina you can find.

It helps that this place is the most heavily-trafficked in the village, and still retains a quaint charm even after all these years. It's definitely unlike a lot of other locations I've visited, as the decor (high wooden ceilings, warm lighting) make it a preferred stop in the summer.

The biggest problem is the lack of seating. It seems that every time you come in, you have to wait and try to snatch up a table immediately, because (and this is a problem with almost all Starbucks) people come in and loiter/work while sipping coffee. The chairs are also very uncomfortable to sit in due to their design, and I get the feeling that some malicious designer made them that way so people are more apt to leave quicker.

Also, if you're coming here during hot weather, be prepared for long lineups. It's almost always a zoo if there's a festival in Memorial Park, and you'd be better served hitting up one of the other coffee shops in the village.

Regardless, I love this spot. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"If there were a zero star I would give it!
I guess it's corporations gone wild!
I bought a $5 cup of coffee this morning and went back for a refill
No refills
I will go out of my way to never go to Starbucks again
Can't refill with a product that probably costs them 1 cent?!
Goodbye rip off Starbucks 
FU"}
{"text":"good location great customer svc decent prices especially considering youre on the strip . i enjoy numerous different drinks here wish i could tell u the names of them (infusions , maybe?!?)was a little disappointed they stopped sale on the Naked juices but they make up for it with all the goodies they offer ...TIP TIP HOORAY !!"}
{"text":"I would have given 5 stars but they seem to have bad attitudes here. Not very polite. 

The drink was on point, very tasty, perfect temperature but the woman who served me did not have a friendly demeanor, didn't respond when I said thank you, etc."}
{"text":"Always understaffed with long lines and poor hours. Avoid if possible, but works in a pinch if you don't mind waiting for a while."}
{"text":"Cute little Vegas sign that you can take a picture by. Other than that, service is mediocre and so is the coffee. Slightly busy when I ordered, and waited a while for my coffee."}
{"text":"Starbucks coffee is sludge, but the company thrives on selling of their lifestyle. Get an itunes thingy with your purchase, buy the CD of the music of the current ambiance. Whatever. That's enough to fool half this planet into making this company's product apart of their daily lives, and the people who made this location apart of their daily lives...actually have it pretty good.

I can't imagine this location being a huge morning stop for too many people. This is actually the only Starbucks I know of that is more of a popular destination on afternoons. Especially, weekend afternoons. 
The interior is literally the size of a narrow hallways cornering the coffee making counter thing. What do you call that? A Bar?
The service is friendly, and the options are limited. I've always been pretty disappointed with the coffee blends limited to only...one blend. No options, no choice. I can always get a latte, but I could just ask for half a cup of coffee and add my own milk until the cup of coffee becomes a latte. 
The tables are never neatly formed, so it feels unkempt. But in reality it's acceptable in terms of cleanliness. It's kinda boring though. So what's the deal?

The biggest selling point here is the very open concept patio seating overlooking Sheppard Ave to the North, and the paring lot for Canadian Tire and gas station immediately South. There is no view whatsoever, but somehow it's rather comfortable on a sunny day. 
Also, always seems to be plenty of eye candy fixated on their wireless device, apparently studying something require a lot of conversation with someone else over none related topics. I feel totally fake fabulous drinking my whatever the hell drink, and taking in the breeze of gasoline. 

Such a perfect reflection of our fat free, foamy society."}
{"text":"The barista kept giving me the wrong cup of latte.. The previous people in front of me had ordered the same kind. She kept leading me on saying that it was mine, but didn't bother to read the names on the cup instead. There's a reason why they ask for your name on the cup lady. 

Thank goodness I don't work too far from this location because every order takes a little too long."}
{"text":"Je ne suis habituellement pas une adepte des Starbucks, mais je dois dire qu'à chaque fois que je suis dans le nord-est de la ville, je sais que je peux compter sur ce sympathique endroit pour travailler et y déguster une de leurs succulentes boissons. 

Le service est toujours impeccable, on prend le temps de répondre à mes questions par rapport au menu, on comprend bien mon nom et on me salue gentiment à chaque fois. C'est vraiment agréable de sentir qu'on est important pour l'employé et qu'on n'est pas simplement une autre commande dans sa journée de travail. 

Pour la saison estivale, je vous conseille fortement de prendre un de leurs thés froids qu'ils nous offrent avec ou sans sucre ajouté (cool option)!! Mon préféré? Thé blanc aux framboises. Il y a une terrasse pour pouvoir profiter du soleil en début d'après-midi. 

Stationnement disponible pour les conductrices et conducteurs comme moi, service à l'auto pour les pressé(e)s et fauteuils ultra-confortable à l'intérieur pour les journées où on feel pour s'habiller en mou."}
{"text":"Unkempt and out of everything --no scones,dirty tables and dirty area where you put your kids on and get straws-love Starbucks but won't be back here"}
{"text":"Don't come in the middle of the day feels like everyone wants a break and the lines are forever and the drinks are not made correctly I saw 4 people return their drinks because they were made wrong I got skipped twice and my drink was made wrong -get it together"}
{"text":"Across the entrance from our hotel.  What more could I ask for.  Very large unit that was pretty quiet on the 4th of July weekend.  Typical Sbux service; efficient and friendly.  Nice open layout for the work week crowd."}
{"text":"Went to starbucks with my wife inside Caesars palace(Infront of Joes restaurant) 
And order espresso and ice tea the rep name CONNIE (black american girl)
Was so rude and don't even smile! Usually starbucks employees are fun and nice, we asked her few  questions regarding the tea options and she give us an answer with a bad attitude like she is doing us a favor when she answer,the feeling of come on move fast.if you don't happy to work in Starbucks  change you position to something else,but don't stand there with your disgusting attitude and talk to people. 
I am totally in shock that Starbucks hire grade C employees"}
{"text":"I was happy with the service and my coffee, the line moved fairly quickly.  If you like Starbucks this place is pretty good."}
{"text":"Having been a Starbucks Barista myself that worked at a Drive Thru store, the service here is inconsistent as much as the inconsistency in the quality of their drinks. I have also noticed that they are severely understaffed most the time and a lack of focus on doing their jobs where they are otherwise assigned to.

There is no reason why they shouldn't be able to separate my transaction at the drive thru, I understand if it's rush hour, but there was no other cars ordering except for me. Secondly, if I was in a car full of people who wanted to pay for their own drinks, are they also going to refuse me? The standard at most stores, including the one I previously worked at, was that we are able to separate your transactions as long as it's not unreasonable and that there is not long line up.

I asked for 180 degree latte, and only got extra hot. When they make a mistake on a white MOCHA frappacino, mocha which is chocolate type + coffee, I just get the chocolate without the coffee. Then the barista proceeds to put the drink back into the blender with extra liquid of coffee pumps, so now the frappacino is extra watery and not slush.

This is not just on one occasion. I will most likely just visit the one in metro down the road."}
{"text":"Cute little Starbucks located inside the service plaza off of I-80. I so hate to give any Starbucks a bad review since I consider them the Mecca of coffee shops and since this location is really small and really cool it pains me to say that this could be one of the worst I've been to in years in regards to service. I ordered my usual simple Grande \"No Foam\" Latte\" with an extra shot. What I got was a cup full of foam, I mentioned the fact that the cup seemed light so I removed the lid to expose the infraction the young girl that made my drink asked if I wanted her to topped it off with coffee. I hesitated in disbelief and before I could say no I want you to make me another one she disappeared in the back. So I looked around to see two employees sitting at the only table in the place another sweeping the floor with his ear buds in. Being pressed for time I dropped the foam fill cup in the trash and continued on my journey rest assure our paths will cross again and I will get my latte on the house because I know this place can't be staffed with this level of intelligence all the time so they get two stars I just can give then one it would be a sin I think"}
{"text":"It's located inside Green Valley Ranch Hotel and Casino. Fast and friendly service. Can not redeem bonus stars if you have the Starbucks app. It's convenient if you want coffee, instead of the cafe."}
{"text":"Really great customer service... I'm not used to that lol ... USA  Starbucks are rarely ever friendly. It's always great to see someone enjoying their job."}
{"text":"This location of Starbucks is usually busy even when it was not renovated. There is decent amount of seat as its in a mall to seat down and have sip. 

I didn't have any problems with the service but it does take time if there is a big lineup."}
{"text":"This is a brand new Starbucks. 
It is 24/7 and with a DT. 
It's a lot more better then the Tim across the way. Guess they learnt from the competition. 
Going to be fun to see how it works havering a Starbucks and Tim's next to each other"}
{"text":"Love my local Starbucks, great service, friendly staff that have been there for some time and they have a drive through for when I can't stop in. Highly recommend this location if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Every Sunday, I see exactly the same people. These faces are some of my most committed recurrences, and I couldn't put a name to any of them.
This Starbucks location has the friendliest staff I have encountered of any Starbucks. This could be that they know my face, and I am somehow given the 'regulars' treatment. I hope not, because I don't know anyone here. I barely make any eye contact with the people I recognize from my Church buying coffee here. This location caters mainly to the residents of Deer Park. 
On Sunday mornings, if I manage to get a seat by the window, I would stare out into the streets and watch the unending black yoga pants and neon coloured shirt locals jog down Yonge Street, breathing in all that car exhaust. 

There are almost always one or two panhandlers directly outside, or closer to the Tim Horton's directly next door. There is a small area to secure your dog's leash out front while you buy your coffee. 
Coffee here tastes much like coffee anywhere.

The cleanliness here varies from pretty clean, to not very clean. I would like it if they'd clean it more often. It's very boring, not much can be said. 
One thing good about this place is that you won't find beanie wearing people who live off of free WIFI, considering its Deer Park, and everyone here can afford such things on their own.

I don't foresee myself shaking hands and shooting smiles at familiar faces here any time soon."}
{"text":"Often out of items like yogurt by 9:00 AM.  Management seemed indifferent at first but then apologized"}
{"text":"This location gets really busy during lunch time in weekdays. The service is poor and they tend to get angry when people have slightly harder orders than regular coffee. you can feel that some employees are not happy their and are pissed at making hard drinks.  My experience wasn't good on multiple occasions. 

The place its self it not that big and have does not have parking problems as its located in a plaza.This place has a drive through as well."}
{"text":"The Shop is connected to Sherway Gardens and is on one of the west mall entrance side, so you will have to go outside the mall. The shop looked quite new, has a great vibe and look. There was decent seating availability and the service was fast, friendly and they made the drink right! 

You can get Second cup or Timothy's inside the mall if you are not in a mood to go outside. I parked beside Starbucks and got the coffee before going in."}
{"text":"Horizon and College.  Employees so noisy I couldn't communicate with cashier.  Still not sure why only Grande size is shown on menu.  Will try hard not to come to this location again"}
{"text":"Standard Starbucks coffee and service, but totally flakey wifi. No wifi in a cafe?! This is likely the last time I'll be coming to this location unless it's for a coffee to go. ...unless that's what they're hoping for from their clientele."}
{"text":"Garbage service today at the Chinook Kiosk Starbucks. Usually when a barista screws your drink up, they'll apologize and remake it the way you asked for. Not today. Ordered an americano blanco with room and when the barista handed me my drink, it was filled right to the top. I mentioned that to him, and instead of just pouring a little out, he dramatically dumped the whole drink and made me a new one, sarcastically shoving it at me and asking \"is that enough room?\" Ill stick to the chapters location if I'm at Chinook. This was awful."}
{"text":"The staff at this location are beyond amazing.  Always a pleasant greeting, no matter what time of the day I am in here. Drinks are always just how I order them and the food I've had has always been delicious and fresh. Today's caramel Machiatto was just exactly how I wanted it and Janessa even put extra caramel drizzle on it without me asking. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Very nice and one of the bigger Starbucks I've been too. Staff was extremely nice and a great environment. Plenty of space to sit and relax."}
{"text":"This is an alright location. It is pleasant enough.. It is fairly busy. I will give Starbucks credit for consistency and reliability. I would easily choose Starbucks over Tim Hortons coffee. There are so many better choices for coffee in Calgary. If I was in a small town with few choices I might rank it higher."}
{"text":"Big 
Fancy and luxurious.




But internet too slow.
Inside room is either to cold or to hot and stuffy.
Occasionally too slow"}
{"text":"Never had to write a review for Starbucks before, every location has been great, this Starbucks just opened. I have been twice and as nice and large as it is, service seems to slack. Sat in the drive through without anyone taking my order for 15 minutes. When I finally said hello he told me to look at the menu and that he was sorry, well what the heck do you think I've been doing for 15 minutes. Another 5 minutes went by still no answer, ended pulling forward getting stuck behind a line of cars without placing an order. Thanks for starting by day off right Starbucks!"}
{"text":"I started coming to this location when a friend of mine said that it was the best place to study. Since then, I have come to love this place. It is a great combination of atmosphere and baristas. The team here seems cohesive and I think overall that creates a great environment where they are super friendly. I have been to a number of other locations around the city to get some quick studying in or to have a coffee break, and a bitter barista really kills the vibe. So, it is always refreshing to come to this location... and I very much appreciate the crew here."}
{"text":"The service is the quickest I've seen, and the employees seem to truly care about the customers! I would highly recommend stopping by. They get my (SUPER complicated) drink out quickly and correctly every day."}
{"text":"The speed of the drive thru has improved overall since they opened. This location gets pretty busy but it's not any worse waiting than other locations. 

Inside: Last time I had to wait over 10 minutes for my drink when there were three people in front of me. I wish there was a little more consistency. 

However, I like this location because it's convenient and the employees are friendly!"}
{"text":"Offers \"enhanced service\" where they take your order in line....except the guy taking orders doesn't know the menu.

Ok location, convenient,  but limited menu which they won't say up front (Dodge around it). 
They do offer the stock menu for coffee only. Don't try for a pour over!  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Worst Starbucks in the valley. The only reason I go to this location is because it's a minute away from where I work. Drive thru is always slow, even at 5am! They constantly get my drink wrong when they already know I go there everyday and get the same thing. My stomach is very sensitive to dairy so I always get soy milk. Every other day or so I get whole milk when I repeatedly tell them 'soy.' Smh! The other day the lady(bad attitude btw) at the drive thru forgot to give me my sandwich so I had to wait for another 5 mins trying to get her attention. Idk what's wrong with the staff/management at this store but they need to get their shit together."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the bad reviews are about because I've had nothing but great, friendly service when I go to this location (which is often as it's by my house). And aside from there always being a long line in the mornings, I feel like I've always received my order in a timely manner. The consistency of the quality of my drink is spot on too."}
{"text":"I am an extremely loyal Starbucks customer; daily, sometimes twice.  For the past 5 days, I have been ordering the Matcha Lemonade and it has been delicious!  However, today I got a drink that was clearly made with very little effort!  It had LARGE clumps of the powder at the bottom, raw powder sitting right on top of the ice, and even more powder sitting on top of the OUTSIDE of my lid!! It tasted terrible, even after rinsing the lid and mixing thoroughly.  I'm very disappointed and would like to advise that the baristas take effort with all drinks, but particularly those they are promoting for charity!!"}
{"text":"I just popped into this location at the corner of Wilson and Bathurst. It can sometimes be tricky to get parking here, but today must've been my lucky day because I was able to get a spot right in front of the door. 

I had in mind to get my usual \"no water soy chai latte\", but when I walked in I saw a sign that reminded me that they now have coconut milk. I was really unsure about the chai coconut milk combo, and I asked the staff if they thought this would be a good combo. To my surprise, the young lady working offer to whip me up a sample. I was so impressed. I asked if this is normal, and she said, \"well, if I can't tell you what it's like, I should let you try it. We're not busy, so why not?!\" THIS is the reason that I keep coming back to Starbucks. Great customer service. 

Thanks ladies for warming up what otherwise has been a chilly, dreary, rainy day!"}
{"text":"Ordered a slice of cake and heard the guy who was taking my order spoke a different language to another female employee; she looked at me and laughed. If you connect the dots, I'm sure thy were talking about me. Unprofessional and very disrespectful."}
{"text":"The staff here are wonderful and make the best drinks. The drive thru line can be problematic but it's far better than the other Starbucks in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Like this Starbucks for its perfect location and drive through availability! Although, sometimes it's very busy, the staff is so used to it, that wait time never exceeds 5 min. Great job"}
{"text":"There are tons of Starbucks stores where I am in the Northwest/Centennial area, but I wish I was so much closer to this store. I always make it a point to stop here when I'm in the Henderson area. Brandy & Sarah are always there when I go and they are just the sweetest. Beverage quality is also amazing here."}
{"text":"This was one of the best Starbucks I've been to. Fast service. Friendly service with a smile people in line were friendly as well"}
{"text":"This is a Starbucks kiosk inside the mall next to the AT&T store. There's always a line but the baristas do a decent job at moving it along. There aren't any tables to sit but there are a few high tops nearby where you can hang out for a bit."}
{"text":"I always try and get a tall caramel macchiato to get me going. The unsmiling lady at the counter kept sighing loudly  because I didn't have my payment ready (I was expecting my hubby to pay for it). Used my phone app to pay. The coffee suddenly doesn't taste that good. In fact, it tastes watered down. I'm going to be avoiding that store from now on."}
{"text":"In Winter i would have given this 2 stars but now they have some seating outside in the sun so that earned it the extra star.

Inside is horrible uncomfortable to find a good seat. The seating is some high couch and table style on the left hand side as you walk in.

The staff are great. Somehow after 2 day gap of me going there the girl behind the counter remembered that I don't have cream on my ice coffee. Great memory."}
{"text":"Good enough Starbucks location.  I drive a little out of the way when I am in Pittsburgh to stop here.  It's at the end of a strip mall and like most Starbucks, the service is a little slow.  I never understand why they only have one person making drinks.  No idea.  

They did screw up my order but it actually worked to my benefit.  On top of my coffee, I asked for the egg white sandwich.  Somehow they heard \"egg bites\" and I'm not the pickiest when it comes to food so I just took them.  It's something I typically wouldn't order but I'm glad I received them.  They were excellent.  They came with gruyere cheese and bacon.  It all worked out well in the end."}
{"text":"Thus is one of the prettiest starbucks I've seen.  They say don't judge a book by its cover...with that said very pretty w/ not so good coffee.  The prices are too high which I didn't mind if the coffee was good ...but it wasn't.  Anddd the service was slowww ...don't recommend this location."}
{"text":"My mobile app showed an error, took the money off my card. Then said it couldn't process my order m i spoke with the manager.  Explained everything and she made my order. It o Mmmmmmmm ly gave her 5 cause that is the highest available rating. Thank you Starbucks."}
{"text":"There are two Starbucks' within Caesars. You can't use your card at this one so don't bother going if you want your stars. The cashier who told me was awkward as well and made me uncomfortable telling me what I wasn't allowed to do within this Starbucks, so I left. The other one accepts your card but you can't reload it. Weird as hell. Caesars Starbucks', step your game up, seriously. So many more in the area, I can easily go across the street to the one at the Linq, which is 24 hours. Your loss"}
{"text":"I'll give this place a negative star!! Rude, slow, and unprofessional! I had to argue to get my order. Told the manager to make me a new tea. Who likes watery taste tea anyways! I would never come back to this place again."}
{"text":"If you have to be somewhere this is one of the slowest drive thru lines ever , even the wait inside is pretty long ."}
{"text":"The worst Starbucks I've ever been to. Extremely slow. Line of 10 people took 30
Minutes to get served a lime refresher and three waters. Not to mention I paid $12 for the three cups of water and the lime refresher. Most expensive and slowest Srarbucks I've ever been too. I vow to never come back to this Starbucks."}
{"text":"This isn't your typical Starbucks, this is the King of Starbucks. Or should I say Queen? This delicious franchise specialty coffee house has an amazing roof top patio where patrons can enjoy their coffee while overlooking all that 4th Street Mission District has to offer. It's great for people who are wanting to catch a little bit of sun while enjoying their Venti Soy Carmel Macchiato or Grande Blonde Roast, or just wanting to people watch. Also, the free wifi is an added bonus and completely accessible from the rooftop patio. This makes Mac users rejoice in happiness. I mean, does it get much better then being able to access the Internet, while at Starbucks, sitting outside on the rooftop, and overlooking 4th Street, Mission, and downtown? You better believe it does not."}
{"text":"Great service here, the ladies here are super friendly! This Starbucks is one of the smaller ones, so it's almost always hard to find a seat during rush hour."}
{"text":"This Starbucks has gotten a lot better since they moved down the street and got a drive thru and more parking! I typically drive through, which seems to be faster than going inside. Lines start to get longer once 7:30am rolls around. Staff is friendly and I've never had any issues with my orders here!"}
{"text":"Last night I visited this Starbucks through the drive thru and ordered a tea, when I arrived at the window the only card I had with me was declining, after numerous attempts the lady at the window offered my drink to me for free. I just wanted to say thank you for your kindness, and I apologize for any inconvenience! Wish I caught her name to properly thank her!"}
{"text":"This one has a drive thru!! The staff here is very friendly. It's always nice to see them even on a gloomy cloudy day as they always had l have a genuine smile on. Drinks taste great."}
{"text":"This Starbucks has super long lines during busy school times. This is not the place to go if you want to stop for quick coffee between classes. I've never really had a problem ordering, but I get a pretty common and simple drink (tall Carmel macchiato). If you have a complex drink, then don't come to this location. They are super busy and baristas are usually sleep deprived students so don't be surprised if your double shot grande flat white with coconut milk at 140 temp isn't spot on. But, if you're on campus at times that aren't so busy (later classes or summer classes) then this location is just fine. I also think that they are a little heavy handed with the coffee at this location. For some reason, one tall coffee from here keeps me wide awake! At other locations around the valley, the caffeine from one coffee has little effect."}
{"text":"Sure it's a Starbucks and you know what you'll get. But overall this is also one of the most cramped, claustrophobic, noisy Starbucks I'd ever visited. My suggestion, keep on moving to another just a few blocks away in either direction."}
{"text":"If we are sitting on the patio then the other starbucks in the center is great but when I just want to grab a drink or buy a bag of coffee this location inside vons works great. They have tables right there so you don't have to walk far to sit and enjoy your drink with a paper or muffin. There is also seating near panda express but who the heck wants to sip on starbucks while smelling panda? The bluberry muffins and strawberry banana smoothies are good too. The cashier is always nice and helpful here."}
{"text":"Starbucks on Baseline and 24th, I've got something to tell you. It's over. I can't love you anymore. It's you, not me. Your baristas just got raises company wide plus free college tuition... But the are so angry when customers walk in. Today we were running late so we called in 5 drinks. The barista said we were \"annoying\" for calling in drinks. Plus, he took extra time goofing off. We all felt super awkward and, upon leaving, immediately exclaimed we were don't with you. You are a Starbucks. Why would your baristas work in food service if they hate SERVING customers? I'd say it was my fault, that I don't understand what you're going through... but I too was a partner. It's a crummy job but no one makes you go to work... You choose it... Customers deserve a smile. Only Sean smiles. Please replace everyone but Sean with robots."}
{"text":"Elitist snobs. It was 8AM. There's about 6 people behind the counter and only 1 cashier. I was patiently waiting for this 1 cashier to get her act together with everyone else. Then they finally open another register. Then comes a Seven star level Caesars Palace card member and he waits off to the side. After the second cashier asked me to step up.  Then she goes excuse,  he is a 7 star member and got his order first.  And to top it off they got my iced Americano order wrong. How does anyone get that wrong?"}
{"text":"After 2 visits on two consecutive days with my wife - long lines both inside and with drive through.  Only one barista working each line.  People walking out and none of the staff acknowledging the problem.  We waited the first time and purchased with the very long delay and the second time we walked out knowing it would take forever to get served."}
{"text":"This location of Starbucks is extremely convenient since it's right in Desert Ridge and close to the movie theater. I've frequented this location quite a bit but my experience today prompted me to write a review. I went in today because it's my birthday and Starbucks gave me a free drink to celebrate. The store wasn't busy and there was only one person in front of me. When I got up to order, I gave the cashier, Alexia, my coffee order and got a chocolate chip muffin. She informed me that the store's oven was broken so my muffin couldn't be heated up (not a big deal) but why hasn't it been fixed? Then I pulled up my app and showed it to her and she told me to scan it, which I did. Her response was \"there's no money on that.\" My response was \"this is for my free birthday drink.\" Her response was \"well you had to tell me that.\" It was so rude and very off putting the way she said it. I also asked for a cup of water as well. My order for my drink came out correctly but I didn't get my water. I had to grab a cup and fill one up myself. Finally, the store was dirty- trash on the floor and tables not cleaned off. Disappointed in this location and lack of good management."}
{"text":"This Starbucks was fast. Cashier was not so friendly! 
Try their cake pops they are the best!"}
{"text":"This Starbucks is interesting. Their very fast but one time it had a sign that said Creditcard only or Starbucks app or Applepay. Which is odd to me because i thought it would be the other way around. But besides that. This is a great location. Friendly workers. And up-to-date fixtures and tech. Free wifi that actually works good too. I wouldn't mind actually sitting here and enjoying my drink here."}
{"text":"I went to buy a medium roast coffee today at 5:30pm.  I have to say that the cashier was pretty rude.  Well maybe not...you have to tell me.  Perhaps she had a bad day or something.  I went up to her and said \"Hi There!\" with a smile...she stared at me and said nothing.  I said \"ok then I want a tall medium roast pike\".  She didn't say anything and began to ring it up and looked away but didn't ask if I wanted anything else.  I said \"Hold on! I have a $1 off coupon\".  She just stared at me and says nothing again!  So I guess that weird stare was a signal for me to show her the coupon.  I pulled out my phone and showed it to her and she looks at her computer and punches it in.  Hands me the coffee and looks away.  I wasn't sure if I should leave or not at that point.  There was no finish. She didn't ask me if I wanted a receipt or not...nothing!  I did all the talking in the relationship!  Then I thought to myself, maybe she doesn't understand or speak English.  Nope, she was doing that pretty well with her fellow staff.  It was probably one of the most awkward services I've ever had at a Starbucks.  I think if you don't enjoy speaking to strangers or don't like people, you should not be working in any type of customer service position.  It got weird."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best Starbucks staff. Always friendly and service with a smile. That's all I ask!"}
{"text":"The BEST service I have ever gotten this morning from Shellie at Starbucks Power and Guadalupe.  She made me a fresh pour over decaf and brought it out to where I was sitting.  This lady is a tribute to customer service above and beyond.  

Thank you Shellie for making my day much more special.  You're AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"Two of my favourite things combined: Starbucks and Chapters! The staff at this location are friendly and happy - always a nice pick-me-up to go with a coffee. My latte was quick and tasted good, no complaints. Even on a Saturday afternoon, the line was short and moved quickly. In the same plaza as a bunch of big box stores (Danier, Pier 1, Canadian Tire, and many more), so great to pick up a coffee before an afternoon of running errands."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Starbucks in Las Vegas.

After a nice long walk from Caesars Palace to my hotel, I stopped with more than five minutes to spare before the posted closing hours. They had the sandwich board blocking the path to order a drink, After pointing out the right time, I nearly got into an argument with them that a cellphone time and watch shows they're still open. 

When asked who owns this location, they said to complain to Aria, when speaking to the concierge at Aria, they told me this location is managed by Crystal's Mall which will be getting a call about their shoddy customer service. Extremely disappointing for such an upscale mall."}
{"text":"Been here a few times in the morning but this afternoon was my last. I ordered  iced coffee and thought I heard my name called. I was sitting my stuff down so I didn't go up quickly. When I looked up I saw a gentleman taking a sip of a cup he just received and then told the lady his drink was incorrect. She noticed by the name that it wasn't his, it was mine. She removed the straw and then grabbed another straw and recalled my name. What kind of health classes are these people taking? Health department should shut this place down."}
{"text":"Okay, i know, im reviewing a Starbucks. So! What's it to you? But not all Starbucks are created equally. For one thing, every Barista has their own hidden talent. Take for example, the dude that thinks hes Tom Cruise in Cocktail. As cool as you look when you flip the shaker in the air, its even cooler when the top falls off mid spin and covers the counter with iced tea. Bottom line, ask for your Iced tea James Bond style and watch the water works. Overall, the staff here are great and if you're looking to do some work while you're at the \"coffice\" you cant go wrong!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Or should i say Conpany. Because for some odd reason. The people here are always sooooo slow. Not even joking. But I am a dedicated coffee drinker. So what can you do. Just suck it up and deal with it. Ans smile when you finally get your cup of Joe. LoL"}
{"text":"Nicer inside that many stand alone Starbucks.  Good service but more expensive for being inside a casino"}
{"text":"Nice long roomy interior and same for patio. Got order fast and greeted with a smile. It's own parking is limited but plenty around in the plaza. Those  that complain about the limited parking are just too lazy to walk and park not even some 15 seconds away!"}
{"text":"Un des plus beaux cafés pour étudier ou travailler avec de grandes fenêtres qui permettent l'éclairage naturel et bien éclairé par une pluie de petites lumières au plafond. Une grande table en bois est au milieu de la salle."}
{"text":"Accueil variable selon les personnes, très peu de place, le matin : oublier ! Le café est comme tous les autres starbucks, si vous voulez essayer quelque chose de nouveau prenez le Chocolat chaud pomme-canelle-épices vraiment exceptionnel ! Et profitez aussi du wifi gratuit !"}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly and I didn't find it to be understaffed or rushed at all.

I just got the black bean and quinoa wrap and it was soooo good! I did hear that they are getting phased out though :'( 

If anyone who works there sees this can someone pleaseeeee let me know how they're made, that would be amazing!!"}
{"text":"Been to this Starbucks about 6 times now. They have started trying to be the \"fastest\" Starbucks in town. I think they should concentrate more on being the most Accurate Starbucks in town. Today is the second time in the last 2 visits that they have gotten my drink wrong. Today I ordered a Trenta they gave me a Ventilator. Then to fix it they poured it in a Trenta cup and added more water. Tasted horrible. They remade it but it still doesn't taste right. Only reason they got 3 stars is because my first 4 visits were great. There is a Starbucks less than half mile from here...U think I'll be heading there for a while"}
{"text":"This is a new Starbucks location, inside the Hilton Hotel.

Location 5/5 The establishment is a major draw due to its convenient location for a number of reasons. First, it is inside the hotel, making it easy for those who stay there to get a drink. This seems sort of obvious, but this Starbucks location has very good hours (6am to 10pm) on weekdays and weekends (7am to 9pm). It is not uncommon to  see some \"famous\" hotel goers come here for a drink. For example the Real Madrid players came to get a coffee here when staying during their game in Toronto. Additionally, this location is next to a few offices, and the Shangri-la hotel as well, making it convenient to go for coffee on a break. Lastly, many of those who access the path from the west side of the city can stop here for a coffee, in fact this is the further north west PATH location which can be reached. 

5/5 Coffee is quite consistent, and tastes as good as the best starbucks locations.Never burnt. Both drip coffee and the specialty drinks are good.

5/5 Service generally good, fast and efficient. The line up can be out the door, but this is due to the sheer volume of patrons. 

4/5 prices are Starbucks prices.

5/5 overall place decor is quire nice, it can be summed up as rustic/modern. their bathroom are very clean as well.

Good new location for Starbucks!"}
{"text":"Person taking my order missed a customization. When I asked about it at hand off, she said I didn't request it. I absolutely did, I always do. If she had simply apologized and remade the drink without being defensive and rude, all would have been fine.

This is the third mistake I've experienced at this Starbucks in 4 weeks. I was given the wrong size drink a few weeks ago and the barista realized she made a mistake and it was no problem. I was also given a flat white that looked more like a latte. Given how things are here, it probably was."}
{"text":"friendly barristers, super fast Google internet too, recently remodeled. At least recent to me, it had been awhile since I had been to this location."}
{"text":"Listen, Its about time I say something after coming here for 8+ years and having the exact same morning experience each time; it has to be shared. I LOVE the staff at this location, especially in the morning. For whatever reason, the staff are chipper and send you on your way as though you didn't just sit in line for 25 minutes to get a simple coffee.. I even have the app. So, one would think that it would go faster, seamlessly in the drive thru at 7 am, while others also use their apps. No. 

I always come to this Starbucks, but holy cripes, the parking lot/drive thru/parking stalls/traffic/overall design of this place is what night terrors are made of. I literally feel my anxiety climb when I turn my front tires into this lot, and that's AFTER I have to flip a U turn in the middle of University to get there because of this crummy location. This location is anything but easy and fast. I have waited 30 minutes in line, at times. It is just so frustrating to deal with when people are backing in and out like they just left the DMV with their driver's license for the first time. 

Couple things I have noticed, though: Since the implementation of those hand held card readers that have to be flung out the window for the customers to insert their cards into, the lines have gotten so slow and very, very inefficient. All for a chip reader that is supposed to be, \"more secure\" and yada yada, it doesn't matter we are so behind, it's futile. Also, There should be no parking. Period. Clear the son of a gun out and put up no parking signs, road spikes, anything. This is not a place I would ever park my car, just for the simple fact that idk, it's a drive thru? People without the Starbucks app in line make my blood boil even more, because you KNOW that's a good 4 minutes of them at the window and a good ole' fashioned \"this isn't what I ordered.\" You aren't getting out of there anytime soon - yup, late again for work, thanks. 

Anyway, I share this with the hope that the entire place gets shut down for a good week so \"no parking signs\" and \"apps only\" can be installed. All in all, this is the slowest Starbucks I literally have ever been to in my entire life - and I grew up in southern NE. 

Just take a breath because you are in for a long wait."}
{"text":"They're always really nice here, but I have to say that the attempt to turn this place into more of a restaurant (staff coming around to take orders, checking in) actually undermines the reason I come here (to be able to work without interruption). I'm also a little tired of people 'checking' to see if I want food when I'm at the cash - yes I'm very sure that I don't want food, otherwise I would have asked for it. 

I absolutely don't blame the employees for this, they're just following policy - but I'm not sure how to communicate this to management other than through this review: don't make this checking  a policy. It's annoying and patronizing."}
{"text":"Ample parking spots in front of Starbucks & a patio to enjoy during the summer. Staff is friendly and this location is 24/7. Pretty spacious to hang out, but the middle table is usually occupied by students which is fine, there are still enough tables on the side for the rest of us ;)"}
{"text":"The roomiest Starbucks in the Las Vegas area.  Its in a new free standing building across from the old Starbucks!  Spacious and pleasant indoor and outdoor seating.  Very nice!  It must cater to the college nearby.  I think I have been to about every Starbucks in the metro area and this one is the best.  The staff was friendly and the order made right"}
{"text":"Up two stars with improvement in Americano since I was disappointed last timw, will keep updating......................."}
{"text":"Located in the shopping strip mall in Tuscany, by a Sobey's and some other businesses.

Has a drive thru and ample parking. Two great things.

Ordered a Carmel macchiato and some loaf to go. Quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"This is the newest Starbucks in the Queen St. strip and it's situated on the north side near Lush Cosmetics. Sporting the latest dark wood style SB interiors, this one is easy to access and grab a quick coffee to go and has more seating than the one across from the City TV building. The only thing better than strolling down Queen West on a sunny Saturday, is doing that with a latte in your hand!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good starbucks. Staff are freindly, there's plenty of room inside and outside (for a starbucks it's not bad!)  and you can get some work done here if you're going to IKEA or something.

4 stars!"}
{"text":"I come to this Starbucks all the time, and I love the service and recommendations they provide...especially when I'm having a serious case of ADD and can't make up my mind!

Today, the lovely barista, Ira, recommended a combination of the Hibiscus and Lime refreshers. It sounded delicious, but I still felt I wanted something hot. She knew their selection of Teavana teas really well (some of the other Starbucks still don't seem to know their new selections of teas that well). It wasn't busy (which was a surprise as this location is usually lined up past the escalators) so she told me to take my time and assured me that if I tried something new and didn't like it, I could always bring it back. That's quality assurance!

I finally decided to go with a Maple Macchiato. What can I say...the French girl wanted her maple today!! It was prepared quickly and was so delicious. Keep up the good work folks and I will keep coming back. :)"}
{"text":"worst customer service , I usually happy with starbucks very nice batista everywhere except this place , now I understand why it's always empty.
next time I will drive the extra mile ."}
{"text":"Bad attitude staff. Asked for Soy beverage cuz of lactose intolerance; reconfirmed if it was soy, and it was not. And I am getting attitude as thought it was my fault. No apologies; not even an acknowledgment... so guess something friendly is out of question."}
{"text":"Love this location! My iced white chocolate mocha had just the perfect sweet consistency and the staff were super quick to making it too. The only thing I disliked was having little too much ice but they gave me a discount so it made up for it . Super friendly staff and great coffee made just right, what more can you ask from a Starbucks ??"}
{"text":"Very fast service despite being really busy.  Clean location close to several stores for fast food and groceries.  There is seating outside when the weather is nice."}
{"text":"I came here with my 8mo Cavalier puppy Milo to grab a drink and get him some water and a pupaccino, and he suffers separation anxiety so I had to carry him inside with me. The staff were so friendly and lovely, and they allowed Milo to come inside while we ordered. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Terrible Starbucks experience at this location. As a loyal gold member and avid Starbucks lover, this place should be shut down. I first attempted to order my holy grail drink, half strawberry, half lime refresher...thats where trouble began. The lady taking my order legit stared at me for a good minute before saying \"we dont have those.\" I wanted to be like, well then TAKE IT OFF THE MENU!!!! However, I then asked her if they still had the Gingerbread T-E-A latte, not a Gingerbread latte, but the tea latte Starbucks created not that long ago. She promptly said \"yes\" and I placed the order which was like $8 of a sad disappointment. I collected my drink and took a sip to realize I was just made a straight up Gingerbread latte. The line was long and the workers looked unsavory so I walked away and threw my $8 in the trash. 

I went back today to see if they had my strawberry refresher, still nothing. Take the stuff off the menu like normal Starbucks do if you are out of something!

Idiots. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"One of the worst. How hard is it to follow a mobile order and use the asked for English Breakfast tea? Half the time they give you Earl Grey. Horrendous customer service. Then I get attitude when I point it out to them??"}
{"text":"Pros

- Drive Through 
- Great staff 
- Quick service 
- OK wifi
- Many outlets 
- Free parking 

Cons 
- Pretty loud music 
- Overpriced"}
{"text":"Perfectly situated right as you exit the guest elevators of Harrah's Casino Hotel, Starbucks is the destination for most guests for a quick breakfast and coffee before hitting the penny slots!  There was usually a line, but it moved quickly.  The only complaint I have is that they didn't put out condiments such as cinnamon and nutmeg, like most other Starbucks do.  The workers were nice and got our orders right each time!"}
{"text":"I was irritated when I saw where this moved, but the drive thru line is pretty quick. My favorite one is still the one in I think it's Rocky river but it's close to Lakewood. As long as I don't have to drink DD I'm cool. The staff is really nice and I haven't had a negative experience here yet."}
{"text":"This is a newer location and I love it. When I went on my birthday to get my free drink the staff were awesome at helping me choose something special and fun. They were really friendly and chatty, and not \"too busy\" or snobby. They seem to genuinely love their jobs. I like this location a lot!"}
{"text":"41 minutes three cars back from menu still haven't made it to the pickup window! This is absolutely ridiculous all I wanna do is leave and forget the coffee."}
{"text":"This is the worst Starbucks I've been to yet since my move to Las Vegas. I would stop by about twice a week and order my drink and on sundays would also order wraps for myself and my boyfriend. Anyways, the last time I went there ( and it will be the last) I got charged twice for the same transaction with DIFFERENT amounts. How is that even possible? The next day I stopped by and asked to speak with a manager. The lady that started talking to me was defensive at the get go. No idea why since at that point I hadn't told her my concern. Once I talked to her about the charges she said that these charges have nothing to do with Starbucks but with MGM instead. Huh? How does that even make sense? She then said she would call get manager (even though that's the title she took in the beginning of the conversation). She came back after her phone call and took down my info and saying that her manager will contact me in about 15 minutes. NEVER heard from them and they took $50 out of my account for no reason. Talk about poor customer service!"}
{"text":"So sue me, I'm reviewing Starbucks, and it's entirely because I'm excited that I FINALLY have a coffee shop, of any kind within a reasonable walking distance of my home. Prior to this the nearest 'fix' was a short car ride away, now it's a short walk away.

The location opened, basically in the next door Tim Hortons Parking lot, no kidding their drive-thru's basically kiss and drivers can high-five. So this location, which was custom built from the ground up is a total \"F-U\" to Timmies as they not only scooped their spot but opened up just \"this\" (holds fingers an inch apart) much closer to the Gardiner Expressway ramp, so folks heading to work in the morning can now choose to not drink the dirt water that has befallen Tim Hortons locations.

Not saying S-bux is that much better, I mean you can pay the equivalent of a McDonalds dinner for two here in one coffee... just saying.

The perks here:

1) Huge location
2) Tons of seating, couches, work tables, high tops, low tops, tables for 2, 4, 6, and 10
3) Amazing Industrial design features, reclaimed wood and iron exposed pipes
4) Drive-thru
5) Ton's of well laid out parking, Next door timmies is a death trap for bumpers
6) It's open 24/7...

That's all"}
{"text":"This is a good court location.  As always SB offers WiFi.   The connection is horrid.   This is such a poor customer experience."}
{"text":"The staff and the service at this location are pretty good. I like that they have a parking lot and a great location.  At times the drive threw can take a little longer than the usual. 
The cafe seating area and washrooms are always clean. 

The quality of the products are great as usual."}
{"text":"Lady cashier (at the Caesar's Palace location) w/ shaved head w/ so rude!  Prices too high.  I wouldn't mind paying for the high price if customer service w/ good."}
{"text":"If I could give NEGATIVE stars I would. I moved to this area over 5 years ago and this Starbucks has gone from awesome to dismal! 

Five years ago, their drive through was on point. The wait was no longer than five minutes - now the wait is upwards of fifteen to twenty minutes!  Really?!?!  Most people have places to go and if they want their coffee treat, they, like me, leave ten to fifteen minutes earlier so they can get their treat. This Starbucks will make you late EVERY SINGLE TIME!

Then you add the people. Five years ago, the staff was awesome!  They knew who I was, knew what I wanted and was very friendly. This new staff leaves a lot to be desired. They are rude and borderline mean. They screw up my order every time. Just last night I ordered a TRENTA iced tea and the barista said I ordered a VENTI. I think I know what I ordered as this is the SAME drink I order EVERY SINGLE DAY!!!!  Fix your damn ordering system or have the baristas clean their ears!!

And lastly, don't bother going there if they are near closing. They are so rude during that time that they will not cater to their customers. Tried to order a pastry and got told \"we've already dumped our pastries for the night\" - really?!?! I thought you cleaned up AFTER you closed the store??  Ridiculous!

Basically if you can, go to another Starbucks and don't bother with this place until they get their act together!"}
{"text":"Worst Starbucks I have ever been to. I ordered a hot cappuccino and picked it up.  I wondered why it felt like a empty cup.  Got to the car and found it had almost no coffee and was almost entirely foam.  

We shouldn't have to check our coffee before we walk out of the door."}
{"text":"Today, my mom and I went through the Drive thru. This was my first visit to this location. We came at just the right time, we were the only car in the lane.

I, of course, ordered my usual (salted mocha caramel frapp), and my mom wanted to try something different. We asked the man if we could do half of the \"cool lime\" and half of the \"very Berry hibiscus\". He told us that would be no problem.

My drink came out ok. However, my mom's was just a green drink. It looked more like a tea then a cool lime and very berry mixture. We asked the man if this was half and half, and he looked at it, and said, \"Hmm, guess not.\"..... I don't even know how that got past him.

Another Batista said she didn't put the berries in there, and we got the drink back.

Even after the berries were added, my mom said she didn't think there was any \"cool lime\"in there. 

Maybe this place isn't great for such fancy, custom orders......

came back tonight (1/18/14) and ordered two Salted Caramel Mocha Frapps. They informed me that they were out of the salt topping. Really...? but Okay, I asked for them to be topped with the creme brulee sprinkles instead. 

First drink, was right, second drink wasn't. I don't freaking understand.

 The only difference between the two drinks was one was a grande, and one was a vente. When the girl (who didn't take my order) tried to give it to me, I told her it didn't look right. And she goes \"oh, well they put it in as\"..

Do you think I CARE what they put it in as? It's not what I ordered.

The guy with the wannaBe handle bar mustache and gauges was leaning up on the corner of the wall, peeking out, when he said, \"yeah, sorry about that.\"

Meanwhile, four cars are behind me, and honking at me. Sorry, I didn't know that getting two of the same drinks would be such a difficult task.

UNREAL."}
{"text":"I often drop by here and find the place to always have a line up. The staff here are especially slow on Sunday mornings. It's a great hangout place tho when you do finally get your order.. when ordering a hot sandwich, breakfast or lunch, ask them to leave it in longer as I've had undercooked meals in the past."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Just went thru the drive thru, where I was handed a Venti latte (I ordered a Grande) WITH NO ESPRESSO IN IT!! Staff is too wrapped up in themselves to help customers. Thanks for the hot milk.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I want to update and compliment the significant improvements I see now that have started to go back occasionally. There are two separate areas now for drive in and walk ins which makes getting your coffee faster. Great job"}
{"text":"The design of this Starbucks is quite futuristic. I love it as much as I do the location. The missing star is the fact that they don't honor the rewards program. I'm not sure why a Starbucks location would do this. The fact that you earn stars but can't redeem anything is the confusing factor for most people, I think.

I know the rewards program is not what it used to be and the fact that the free refill policy covers everyone might hurt business, but at least birthday and reward drinks should be honored. The significantly more expensive drinks should cover for that. Being in a prime location makes me want to pay the extra dollar, so no harm there, at least not for me."}
{"text":"This place was horrible! I ordered a vanilla bean frapuccino at 8:00 and they totally forgot about my order. I waited till 8:20 because I was making excuses to myself, maybe they are still making it or they are busy but then I had enough because the place wasn't full either for them to have a freaking excuse for taking too long. So I went and I complained about my order taking too long and the lady seemed pissed because of my complain. So in less than a minute she made my drink and it was disgusting, like if it was made in a freaking hurry! I hate this place! Que se vallan a la verga!!"}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite Starbucks in Henderson! The baristas are extremely friendly and some even know me by name. They make great suggestions when you're unsure about a drink or pastry and the service isn't too slow. The drive thru can get backed up sometimes, so it's quicker to go inside."}
{"text":"This Starbucks gets 5 stars as it is the best Starbucks loacation I have ever been to. To be clear, this is the Starbucks located in the Path - part of the Royal Bank Centre by the Union Subway entrance.

The staff are simply amazing here. It is easily one of the busiest locations as everyone gets off the Go Trains and are funneled into the PATH system in front of this location. I go 1-2 times a day (for the last 2-3 years) and I can honestly say I have yet to see someone have a bad day and slip on customer service - incredibly rare!

If your a regular, they make a point to know your name and drink. they just say Billy - would you like your Grande Skinny Mocha? This is not just one or two staff members, it's everyone. When you see the manager in action, you quickly learn why the staff are so good, she is incredible and winner of Starbucks Manager of the year award multiple times.

They have three people working the cash when its busy and they take your drink orders while your still in line. By the time you pay, your drinks are ready and waiting for you. Don't worry if you see long lines, they move quickly.

Bonus - they are opened on Saturday and Sunday, great for people working on a weekend in the Financial district.

I go out of my way to come to this Starbucks... the amazing staff ensure I start my day off with a smile. Try it yourself and see the difference.

{"text":"I was very disapppointed with the service at this Starbucks location. I wish there was an option to give them zero stars because they disregarded my order. I had to personally show them my order after they served 15 people. I ended up showing TWO baristas my order, and somehow, they still got it wrong. These mistakes could have easily been forgiven; however, NOBODY apologized for their mistakes and even laughed at my expense. Please train these baristas to have better customer service for the other unfortunate customers who decide to other through Tapingo at this location."}
{"text":"Expensive on prices. Rude staff. Slow. Try another location. There are plenty nearby on the Vegas strip or MGM."}
{"text":"This is the slowest serviced Starbucks ever. You have to witness it yourself. They need a manager to speed up processes. Not effective."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????grande?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Sitting in a line of 15 cars, which are coming from both directions (which, by the way, needs to be fixed with a painted lane and arrow-- lest some road rage violence is bound to arise).  Pretty sure this is the slowest one on the planet. Also, I'm pretty sure I have never received a verbal \"thank you,\" despite my frequent patronage. The inside is slow because the drive thru takes precedence, yet the drive through is interminable. They also don't have a dog water bowl.  I think I'll drive the extra mile over to the local perk up."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had at a Starbucks. There were 2 other people in the store and 3 people working. They forgot to make the drink. Was told, \"oh, I thought you were just sitting there,\" by a barista. Thanks for making me late due to your carelessness."}
{"text":"Filthy dirty. Very slow workers. So glad I don't live by this one. There wasn't even a trash can outside, so people used the ground"}
{"text":"This particular location has to be the most frustrating I have ever been to. I am lactose intolerant and hate soy, every time I come here I ask for coconut milk. Low and behold they NEVER have it. How do you not have coconut when that seems to be a trending dairy alternative now? Get your product ordering together! 
The drive thru moved fast this morning but the guy at the window was really just bleh. deff forever going to the russell/ eastern location only!!!"}
{"text":"This place is clean, large and with plenty of room to sit. Staff members are friendly and very accommodating. I was here with my friends and we even got free refills. Inside is cool which helps with the LV heat."}
{"text":"Fast drive through. Consistently good beverages. One thing, if I order a vanilla sweet cream cold brew with extra  vanilla sweet cream on the side, you shouldn't charge for the side. If it's in the beverage then I'm already paying for it. Besides that, they do a great job here."}
{"text":"Clean and small Starbucks inside the JW Marriott. You can catch it just by walking by. They have a cute little green fence on the side and the seating area is blocked off with stanchions so it doesn't interfere with people walking by."}
{"text":"What's better than coffee?? 

Having your many choices of gourmet hot coffees, cold coffees, espresso based drink, teas (hot and cold) fruit smoothies. And then side it with a dessert or breakfast/lunch sandwich or wrap??? 

Ok yes all of that but I love this location of Starbucks because it is AT Chapters!

Grab your drink of choice and if there is no room at the tables (it's usually pretty busy) you can stroll along the many book shelves for hours! Well that's what I do.. :)

During the summer you can find this location to also have several tables outside on the cement pad."}
{"text":"It's a standard Starbucks with friendly staff. Pricing is typical for all Starbucks chains, convenient location. Nice for a grab and go coffee before commuting via subway which is right outside this location."}
{"text":"Ordered a skinny venti Caffe Vanilla Frap with Coffee and got a vanilla creme frap that tasted literally like sugar and the barista attempted to fix the issue by adding coffee to the drink and it tasted even worse. So we switched to the mocha frap which we knew would be coffee based and the barista gave us a coffee mocha drink which literally looked like chocolate milk. After 3rd attempt, they finally got our drink right. 

The Caffe vanilla frap with coffee was written down as VCF. It seems like every time even when we order at other Starbucks and ask for a coffee based frap we end up with a creme based frap. Perhaps they need to use a different acronym to identify the difference between a coffee frap from a creme frap."}
{"text":"This is an awesome store! Located inside the hotel it is always busy but the staff knows what they are doing and the line moves quickly. Except for one barista who is perpetually grumpy, everyone that works there is friendly and outgoing.  Even though I only visit about once a week some of them know my name, which is impressive because they probably wait on thousands of people a day. 

The manager can be a bit brassy and shouldn't yell at her staff so much but it seems to work since she been there for years and the place runs smoothly even with a line out the door and eight people working behind the counter."}
{"text":"This location is terrible. My new job is right across the street but I have started walking two blocks away to a different location that is much better (Omni William Penn, go there instead).  First off all, this location does not accept the Starbucks rewards program.  You can earn stars but not redeem them.  They close really early.  Twice I went in on my 2:15pm break and they were closed. I don't know their actual hours though as they aren't posted anywhere.  You cannot mobile order at this location.  There are always a lot of employees behind the counter but only two of them are actually working.  One takes orders/cashiers and one makes the drinks.  None of them are in any kind of a hurry.  One time when I was waiting at the hand off area, a guy walks in the door and the barista greets him and asked him if he wants (some drink I don't remember) and then starts making his before mine even though I already paid and was waiting!"}
{"text":"The price at this SB at least double for most drinks, and no refill. Prices for such things as coffee mugs are about 50% higher. 

They should put up a sign that says no refill."}
{"text":"I like this Starbucks!  Arrived on a Tuesday morning @ 7:30 p.m. and there were a lot of people but the line was efficient.  

Today is the debut of the new rewards system at Starbucks.  You need 300 points for a free item:-(.  

You get 2 points for every $1 spent.  That means you need to spend $150 now to earn a free item @ Starbucks.  No more freebies for me....

So sad."}
{"text":"This place has really gone down hill! Walked out after waiting in line for 10 minutes behind an employee who appeared to be on some substance that made him dance the whole time he was ordering.  There was no concern for the line of customers behind and we weren't sure if the girl running the register even knew what she was doing.

On top of that, the last few times we've been in there, they have homeless people camped out with their grande waters, just taking up seats.

Plenty of other coffee houses, move on to the next one."}
{"text":"Local neighborhood Starbucks with drive through. The drive through is always at least 10 cars deep no matter what time of the day. 

I always use the app & order my drinks/food before I leave my house in the morning & by the time I get there. I park, walk right in to the pick up counter & my orders ready. Maybe 10 min total from ordering to back in my car off to work. 

Even if I get there & order on my app & wait to go inside. It's faster than waiting in drive through or going to stand in line & wait. 

Seriously, the app ordering is the best thing ever for quicker service."}
{"text":"This Starbucks is literally a hit or miss. Some days there's no wait and some days is packed w/ crowds of people from the convention center. They have their good and bad days. Sometimes my drink tastes horrible and other days it's exactly right.. they need to be more on it about things! Prices are a little ridiculous, as a hotel employee, I still end up paying $7 for a regular $4 coffee :/"}
{"text":"I am tired of rude service at this SB. Went to pik up my online order and when I asked for a straw the young man berated me for taking my drink because it might not be mine. I told him I looked at the label before I took it. If the staff would help u instead of walking by you, I wouldnt have to grab my own drink! Another time I was halfway down the road when I tasted my drink and it wasnt right. I drove back and this guy was so rude. He tried to tell me it was right instead of just fixing it so I tried to show him the order on my phone but he wouldnt even look at it. Also the drinks there arent consistent. Sometimes the drink tastes burnt. How is that possible? One day my drink can be just right, the next day it isn't sweet enough. I order the same number of pumps. I will start going to the one on Dobson rd. from now on."}
{"text":"Good Coffee, incompetent employees! I had a reward on my Starbucks gold account that they claimed wasn't there. Two different baristas couldn't figure out how to use it. I called corporate who said the reward was there and ready to use... So not sure why they lied and said it wasn't there... Maybe they need more money in spite of the 5 dollar per cup they charge for coffee. Glad I'm not a local because I have never had this problem at any other Starbucks I've attended."}
{"text":"This Starbucks drives me nuts.

First, the staff is completely incompetent.  This has been a growing theme amongst Starbucks', but they do some things that really irritate me.

The staff touch their eyes, lips, face, hair and never wash their hands.  Today the girl behind the counter was picking gunk off her eyelash - didn't wash her hands.  They've had two staff members with visible lip cold sores (i.e. herpes) serving ... just, like, the peeps a day off.  

The staff has major attitude as well.  I have a really weird drink order. I get it. I announce that it's weird before I launch into it.  But it's also a $6 drink.  So, for $6, I think I can ask for my drink in an odd way.  It's nothing they can't do.  But today the dude literally rolled his eyes, laughed at me, and went over to discuss it with his co-worker. WTF. What the acutal eff.

Anyway, it's the closest Starbucks to my work so when it's -20, I have little to no choice if I want something from a Sbux.  But I hate it nonetheless.  Actually now I'm just realizing maybe it only serves people in the Hilton (i.e. tourists) because most other offices have a closer Starbucks, so they don't care how they treat people because they don't think they get a lot of repeat business.  Hmm."}
{"text":"Please fix this Starbucks.  It is impossibly slow.  This is my neighborhood spot and I can't wait for 15 minutes for 6 cars in the drive through.   The staff is very friendly but there is no urgency.   I've even gone inside to watch and where other Starbucks have people working together to make items it seems like this one has 6 different people doing 6 different tasks very slowly with no sign of organization.   Fix this Stsrbucks, please!!!!!!"}
{"text":"New location is much improved and service has been great as well. One major issue is getting into the lot when the drive thru line is long. The only entrance becomes blocked by those waiting in line. Something NEEDS to be done about this or I'll start avoiding it again like I did previously because of the lack of parking."}
{"text":"Across the street from OISE and very central to the St George Subway station, this Starbucks always seems quite busy. I like the heritage architecture and the nods to the house's history pre Starbucks. Service is always decent and less of a line than the Tim Hortons down the road."}
{"text":"I came here around 4pm on a Tuesday.

It's a great convenient location with friendly (and pretty cute) staff. Orders come fast and are efficient. The place is often crowded or at least full because of its prime location. There are quite a few seating areas for you to choose from--we tend to find seats pretty easily whenever we come. The place is brightly lit and honestly wouldn't need lights on during the day because of the stream of shaded sunshine from the window.

Drinks are pretty consistent here as with most Starbucks locations. They do matcha well here, in the sense that the matcha powder is well blended with the drink so you don't end up with weird chunks."}
{"text":"This location surpasses the others on the block in a huge way. Its a spacious (and new) location and the staff are always amazing. During the times I've visited, there's barely ever a line up and the service is quiet and friendly. Thanks!! If you can spare the walk from the other location close-by on bloor st, it's worth the trip to bedford."}
{"text":"The only issue is that it is difficult to find from the street, from the convention center and from the Westin. The location is clean and bright. The staff were accommodating and working hard to get the orders out quickly."}
{"text":"Been to many a Starbucks and no complaints with this one. Business was above average but I didn't feel as though I had to wait. The 3 gentleman working were quite efficient and answered my inquiry about a flat white which I had never heard of and did enjoy. The people watching was abundant and at 2:30 in the afternoon surprised me. Being a local in Las Vegas I hardly ever come to the strip , glad I did today."}
{"text":"With great difficulty I finally found the Starbucks and guess what there washroom was out of order! In the whole area this is the only Starbucks near McGill University and there washroom was out of order! Anyways I ordered my Coffee and left the place. I will suggest that please take care of such things as it's in the most popular place!"}
{"text":"Baristas are nice. I like my coffee with a little bit of coffee art and they are expert."}
{"text":"My review reflects the outrageous prices! I looooove Starbucks! I love it and this one delivered with the same food and coffee quality, however...you'll pay about double for everything, can't use rewards, and won't get stars for your purchases? What's the point of calling it a Starbucks if you lose brand loyalty and customer service. Lame lame lame."}
{"text":"This Starbucks is okay.  I don't mind having a Grande Pikes Place or even a iced frappy moca loco (In the words of Paul Mooney), every once in a while.

 This location is always busy and usually has at least two or three laptop writer junky cliches as well as gaggles from the local high schools. On the plus side if it is too busy, there is a Second Cup just up the street and another Starbucks a few blocks south...."}
{"text":"I wanted a Pumpkin spice Latte decaf and a regular Salted Caramel. They made the pumpkin spice without decaf and then promptly made me another one. A little disorganized but nice in the end. 

Fun fact, there are 11 Starbucks within 500 metres of this one according to Yelp."}
{"text":"This Starbucks is amazing! I love coming to this store. It's out of the way for me to go to, but it is totally worth it! All of the managers are really amazing and friendly people. This place offers a true Starbucks experience! Don't hesitate to stop by and say hello to the amazing crew!"}
{"text":"I'm often in this area for work or tutoring and this Starbucks just happens to be on my way so I often stop for some caffeine courage. It has a very friendly staff and good chairs. 

The downside is it is often very busy and its hard to find a place to sit down. 
Also my pet peeve of people not paying and just sitting here seems to happen often, especially in the seats near the washroom, where the staff can't see!"}
{"text":"The staff are always very friendly,As soon as you come in,They know who you are,Excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Un Starbucks reste un Starbucks, vous me direz. Je vous dirai que vous avez raison. Toutefois, cette succursale a ouvert ses portes il y a quelques semaines dans un très grand local du Vieux Montréal, sur McGill. Fraîchement \" construit \", il est très beau et propre. Puisque c'est à côté d'où je travaille et qu'à l'heure à laquelle je commence à travailler il n'y a rien d'autre d'ouvert dans les environs, je m'y rends assez souvent. Le service est toujours excellent et les employés très sympathiques. Après quelques visites, on me reconnait déjà et on prend de mes nouvelles; très belle attention! 

Si vous êtes dans le coin et que vous êtes plus du type commercial, rendez-vous à cette succursale de Starbucks, prenez place dans un confortable fauteuil près de la fenêtre et savourez votre café en profitant de la vue!"}
{"text":"This place is a joke, never have anything on the menu. \"Were out of that\" is the only thing they seem to know. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"Every single time I go here my drink is wrong! It's really frustrating... here I was treating myself with my birthday gift card that I've been holding onto and low and behold my caramel frapp just tastes WRONG! This location is ALWAYS busy I waited for 8 cars in front of me.. so did I go back to correct it, no! Pic attached. This doesn't even look like a caramel frap, where's the caramel??!!!!! Don't mess up on the classics when you get new drinks on the menu"}
{"text":"They are a mess and don't know basic procedures....I also watched the guy behind the counter fill a woman's water bottle and touch the ice scoop to the kid which is absolutely a health violation. As someone who used to work at Starbucks it's a know fact.  Gross"}
{"text":"Just went here on my way to work in desperate need of a wake up. I ordered a frappe with an add shot and had to tell the guy my order 3 times. I didn't taste my frappe until I was almost at work and had realized that not only was there no add shot but no coffee in it. I just paid almost $7 for a cream based slurpee."}
{"text":"Closed before 2pm on a Saturday afternoon. No notice, sign, explanation.... Super sad face."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that if you're looking for a Henderson location to read or do school/home work or computer work - this is the place.  It's a BIG location with lots of varied seating, both indoor and outdoor and both lounge and business.  It's even got a long wooden stool bar with lightening and plug ins for laptops.  It's perfect for a casual meeting or a library substitute.

That said, the service in this location is some of the worst I've seen in the brand.  Every time I've come by I've had to repeat myself multiple times, I've gotten short comments from the staff, and I've been oft ignored for the apparently more important drive thru.  

I've watched the staff bicker and argue with each other right in front of me.  I've had one of the staff members dust the lights directly above myself and everyone else - and our open coffees while also ignoring crumbs, dirt, and grime all over the tables and chairs around us.  I've watched staff whip trash bags around emphatically - dusting up air and who knows what else all in the name of apparent cleanliness.  And most of all, and most importantly, I don't feel like any of the staff members could care less who is there.

Starbucks isn't my favorite place.  But they generally try their best to make you feel welcomed into their corporate coffee paradise.  And I sort of came to expect that.  I didn't find it here."}
{"text":"I love Starbucks!  I always get the same drink, no matter which Starbucks I visit. Problem is - my drink is fixed differently at each location. How hard can it be to teach the baristas how to be consistent at each and every store?  My order is not complicated."}
{"text":"Excellent location on Front Street by Union Station and near the ACC (Scotiabank Centre once the name change comes), Rogers Centre, CN Tower and Ripleys Aquarium. I stopped this Saturday morning and it wasn't too busy. Service was prompt and friendly. The sausage on the breakfast sandwich wasn't heated properly however which I noticed after the first bite. Asked them to just reheat it but they gave me a brand new sandwich. An unexpected touch of customer service. The prices are a bit ridiculous as always. No surprise there. 

I seen this location get swamped in other times so don't know if the customer service will be consistent."}
{"text":"Starbucks quality coffees, pastries, and other assorted food/drinks.

Friendly staff that is able to keep it together during crowd rushes.

And a heck of a location in the beautiful Omni William Penn Hotel."}
{"text":"Standard Starbucks that has more seating spaces than the rest of the offerings in the area.  The staff is friendly, albeit sometimes pushy.  I've always gotten what I've asked for which is a plus even during busy times."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Starbucks to see if hopefully they would have something to eat. Luckily I found this Italian sandwich which was pretty awesome. The located is easy to get to and right in the middle of vegas. The sandwich did have a bit of a bite to it so watch out."}
{"text":"Only Starbucks near me with friendly staff. Always smiling, not just students gossiping and whining behind the counter. Gave me my half priced frapp a few minutes before 3 pm discount start time ;)"}
{"text":"This is one of the worst Starbucks I've been to, I come here frequently so I know it's not just a one time thing. The only reason I come back is because it is close to where I live, although I think it might end up being faster if I travel farther. The drive thru always takes forever, 15-20min, and going inside isn't much better. Today, there were 6 people working behind the counter yet it took 15 min to get my drink and there were only 2 people in front of me. Maybe they need another espresso machine..? I wouldn't mind waiting if it was obviously busy, but it's not, and on top of it the staff isn't very friendly. Every other time I visit (drive thru or going inside) there is always someone complaining about working/wanting to get off work! It seems like nobody takes pride in their work or cares about the customers. If anyone important reads these things, I suggest getting another espresso machine and getting some people who want to be there to work there. The only reason I gave one star is because the drinks are decent."}
{"text":"I have to update my review because the last 5-6 times that I have come here the store did not have proper inventory.  They only had a few types of tea and they didn't have the ingredients to make any of the lattes I asked for.  I asked for the Opera Chai tea Latte and another one and they couldn't make either.  

I understand them not having the product once or twice but 6 times is quite excessive.  I actually walked out on one of the occasions because my favourite drink is a Soy Opera chai tea latte."}
{"text":"Just went thru the drive-thru with one car in front of me. Watched as 4 employees took a group photo (outside of the building) while we all waited in line. It took 10 minutes to get my drink because they were playing photographer - really??? Starbucks, I expected more from you. Especially when I'm paying $2.50 for an iced tea!"}
{"text":"I love this Starbucks, nice peeps and the service is outstanding.
They know their business that's for sure. Keep doing what you're doing because it's working."}
{"text":"Because they are \"owned by a casino,\" they don't participate in Starbucks promotions or give out free drinks from the rewards program, which is kind of shitty. As it's on the strip, prices are  unnecessarily high, and they don't even have the souvenir mugs for Las Vegas. Being in the Crystals mall, it was also pretty loud and distracting; I probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"This place is very hit or miss. They run out of breakfast sandwiches pretty regularly. 

They have a really nice outdoor couches. 

If you are coming here to study, make sure you have your computer charged because they have a lack of plugs."}
{"text":"This location is very convenient and they always seem to have inventory of the drinks I  tend to buy (definitely a plus in my books).  This location gets really busy so service can sometimes take a while but I always order drinks/food from this location to-go.

If you were to sit here, it could potentially be hard to find a seat as it is always packed.

Allover I'm satisfied with the flavour of the drinks that I purchase here."}
{"text":"I visited this location and the employees were really friendly and the service was really quick. I ordered a passion tea lemonade and it was quite tart so they added a little bit more honey and later offered me a free refill, since I used my gold Starbucks card to pay. 

They actually didn't have the passion tea left when I  went to get my refill, so she gave me the green tea one and it was really good. I surprisingly liked it more than the passion tea and might purchase that quite a bit his summer. 

I definitely recommend this location and would go back."}
{"text":"Conveniently located for me right by the elevators so that I can blunt my hangover from the night before. 

The staff is fast and efficient.

Minus half a point for not being able to take my Starbucks card off my phone, and minutes half a point for not being able to refill my card. Why? Well, that's because Harrah's (or their parent conglomerate company) wants to control every freakin' thing, so they're not fully part of the whole Starbucks network. That right there, my friends, is some douchery."}
{"text":"Along the streets of Danforth, you can find this above average starbucks with its friendly service, small space and surprisingly quiet with not that many customers. If you need a place to study or read this location is definitely peaceful. Since its not too crowded, you can definitely find a quiet seating area with a low noise level. Both the seating areas and the washrooms are kept quite clean. Definitely one of the go to Starbucks location compared to many others!"}
{"text":"Incredibly slow service in the mornings.  I've stood in line for 15 minutes just to order one cup of coffee when there were only 2 other people in line.  They are all very friendly but their multi-tasking abilities are extremely poor.  Not a good combination in that line of business."}
{"text":"I frequent this place often and I love it. The service is great here, staff are always friendly and quick with your order. They always manage high volume periods really well."}
{"text":"this place is new? hmm... hmm...
I thought this is here for a long time, may be I mixed it up with the other place...

anyway, first time here using a starbucks card on the phone, appearantly no one knows how it should work. but they are really quick on finding out how, and they did remeber to ask me my name, even I am the only customer in line at the time.

service is great, and the iced green tea frappachinno(?) are just right amount of green tea powder and sweets, which is great for the sunny Friday afternoon."}
{"text":"Very long lines during peak hours but I've never been treated rudely and they will actually come around the counter and start taking orders from everyone in line when the lines are backed so so that when you are finally at the register they have just finished making your drink. They're also the only hotel location on the strip that's nice enough to take mobile pay as long as they can read and type in your number off your phone"}
{"text":"I'd rank this even lower than the airport Starbucks. The prices are higher. The staff doesn't seem to know what they are doing. And the lines can get mangled and disorderly. But if you don't order anything fancy, your overpriced coffee drink should turn out just fine. But if you really want to get a good Starbucks drink, you should go to another location."}
{"text":"Before dinner, my cousin n I decided to get a drink here: What looked like it was going to be a typical trip to the Starbucks was unsuccessful to say the least.

There was a trainee/noob working the register which made the long seem twice as long. It was probably a good 15 minutes before we got to place our order. Pretty crappy ratio when there were only 5 drink orders ahead of us. 

By the time we got to place our order: I wanted to have the new Strawburry refresher: The trainee and the supervisor were taking care of the order. The sup said I'm sorry but we are out of the strawburry refresher. I asked for the Hibiscus refresher and she said I'm sorry but we are out of that as well. Ok so they must have at least one of the Ice Teas: Not the Peach Tea. The supervisor said we are out of the ones you are requesting: She was nice about it & apologized. Thought about getting the water but not for $6.50, so I was like forget it. 

Seeing the average rating of this Starbucks location, it appears that this place needs to reevaluate the employees/management. This is probably the worst Starbucks I've been to with regards to availability of drink options. They can kiss the bottom."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Starbucks because it's across the street from my work and it's a newer store so it's modern and clean. Everyone that has taken my order is always super friendly! Love that they have a drive thru window now too!"}
{"text":"Another Starbucks, another review! I can't complain too much about Starbucks in general, but this location is just too busy! Not any of the barista's fault... Just bad luck that it's located in a mall, and at the food court. 

Not a very large space for people to line-up, order, or wait for drinks. To matters worse, the people waiting for drinks are smart enough to make a line or move out of the way when others need to go up to the counter either. Everyone kind of just stands wherever they want. Makes it really hard for other customers and staff alike. 

Fortunately, they are always well staffed and the baristas are always friendly. Drinks come out pretty quickly considering the amount of people. 

Would be better if Starbucks could get their own store location in the mall, rather than a spot in the food court, but it is what it is. Will most likely end up waiting for a drink if I'm here anyways!"}
{"text":"Its an average starbuck. Size is average and the customer service is average and decently friendly. This store specifically is just off of the highway and not many pedestrians around it unless you are a local resident in that neighbourhood so it is decently quiet and plenty of seating areas. washrooms are clean and atmosphere is down-to-earth and relaxing. When I go to Whole Foods, located near it, I like to stop by this location to pick up a drink."}
{"text":"I am giving this location for stars because they deal with a great number of people in a short period of time, and quality of the food is better than most of the Starbucks I've been to.  

I would like for them not to put the cake pops, especially the pirate cake pop, and with the hot food. My son ate the cake pops anyway, but I was not thrilled that we paid for design and most of the frosting got melted off both of the pops because they were put in a bag with hot sandwiches."}
{"text":"Horrible staffing! They know the hotel is busy but still only staff a few people. Been too many Starbucks but and this 1 is managed poorly.  Not lying maybe 40 people on line. If they don't care about the size of the line then how can I give them my money. I don't need coffee that bad. 
Here is a tip take the escalator down to the Roasted Bean. No line and friendlier service."}
{"text":"I ordered an iced Grande caramel macchiato with extra caramel which is what I usually order which usually comes to a little over $3. It was $7.78 here. In addition, they shook my drink and mixed it but I like how it's usually separated, and the cup was sticky. They don't have a card reader for Starbucks cards and need to manually enter your card number which takes forever. While I was at the counter a woman was complaining about how nasty and stale the pastries were. If you frequent Starbucks locations and enjoy the food, drinks, and atmosphere you should probably skip on this place and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Been to this location a couple times, and figured I'd contribute to the reviews. I personally haven't had any 'bad' experiences some other yelpers have indicated, but I do understand what they are getting at. 

I am usually in this area on Saturdays for work, so I may pop in from time to time. I'm a big fan of the drive thru at Starbucks, as I'm usually the grab and go type.

This location's baristas tends to always be 'having fun' amongst themselves, which I don't mind, but they got to get people's orders in and make the drinks! The 2 times I've been through the drive thru, I ended up waiting quite a long time as the first time, the girl taking my order didn't even know what the Roasted Tomato & Mozzarella Sandwich was... And the second time they forgot to make my drink, so I had to wait at the window as the cars behind me waited even longer (while their drinks were already done!).

They chat and joke a lot with each other, but that ultimately makes their service suffer."}
{"text":"I don't often stop at this Starbucks, and I'm generally leery of Starbucks in this type of location.  I often find myself behind someone who obviously has never been to a Starbucks or doesn't go frequently enough to have a clue about what they want or what the menu items consist of.

This time was great.  I was the only person in line, made my order, and was promptly served.  The service was excellent and the lady who took my order was so nice it made me want to come back to this Starbucks every day.  

Good job Starbucks off the Turnpike!  I'm happy I visited!"}
{"text":"Had to wait way to long for a simple pour over of blonde coffee. Customer service definitely needs improvement, it was surprisingly not busy for a starbucks, no lines a couple cars waiting...5 baristas running around not being friendly and dropping things. Baristas seemed more concerned d with their own personal conversations and the condiment bar was dirty, no Starbucks napkins...not a big deal if the customer service was good. I usually don't complain if I have to wait as long as you get a smile or good service...not too much to ask for overpriced coffee, that I buy daily:)"}
{"text":"This is a typical Starbucks.  The employees are nice, the line is long, and they're always busy.  I can't complain.  They even offer to remake the drink if it isn't perfect for me.  I always order a bone-dry cappuccino and often it is too heavy.  At this location, the barista always checks before they hand me my drink.  It is a nice touch, that I appreciate."}
{"text":"We love this new Starbucks location.  The friendly staff makes our order perfect and fast.  This is a new Starbucks location and extremely busy (for good reason)  We understand the wait will be a bit longer due to it's popularity.   The staff works hard to get every order right and out as quick as they can...  we especially love our favorite drive thru Barista, she is friendly , bubbley, and treats us like family!!"}
{"text":"Good and quick sercices at this location. If there are more seats for the guests, would be better."}
{"text":"I'm so mad I didn't get this baristas name because she really made our short experience seem so valuable. I can only describe her is African American with dark green curly hair. I gave her a gift card that someone just gave me. And the gift I was given from where else was already used fml. She immediately saw my shocked face and she turned an embarassing moment into a funny one. And that is something  so precious in customer service. Other places especially in drive thru want to get you out asap. 

So hopefully her boss sees this review and get this homegirl a raise."}
{"text":"Every morning I get my coffee around 4:25. One of them know me so well already know what am going to get. It's so amazing to have great customer service and enjoy stoping in the morning on days I have to work! Thank you !"}
{"text":"Make sure you do a mobile order if you go here on a Saturday morning. Long line and and long wait time. Better yet, Starbucks, open another nearby location!"}
{"text":"I have picked up my morning coffee this drive thru location.  They got my order very quickly. I could give to them 5 stars but unfortunately they didn't have lemonade for you order one morning."}
{"text":"Has the slowest drive thru ever!! You need to walk inside or expect to wait more than 20mins!! Seriously I had 1 car in front of me and it took this long! I think they went to a different Starbucks to pick up the coffee for me"}
{"text":"I go to Starbucks everyday & am a gold card member & I would definantly drive to another Starbucks than go to this location even though it is right by my mom's house. I am from California & when i viisit this location to get my latte, they ALWAYS mess it up, even after I had to repeat my order 1, 2, 3 times!!! The last time i purchased here was Saturday & the next time I am in Vegas, I will NOT go to this location! By the way, after messing up my drink 3 times the guy at the window didn't appologize & my drink was spilling over & he was VERY RUDE! I wish i got his name but I really wanted to get the heck out of there! He had dark hair & wore glasses!  The staff SUCKS! I never complain on yelp, but this location deserves it by their horrible customer service!"}
{"text":"I love Starbucks in general but this location in particular is awesome! I come to this one a few times a week on my way to work and everyone is friendly and happy looks like they have a good time and are enjoying talking with clients and what not. Many of them even greet me by name, its the little things that make a difference! Thanks Starbucks!"}
{"text":"This location has the Clover machine (which is like a French Press) and a selection of clover brewed coffees, while more expensive, are a head above their regular coffee... of course you can get the Pike Place freshly brewed if you want for the same cheap price. And it's awesome! There's a few tall tables and one long communal table, so plenty of places to put your laptop down, and it doesn't get nearly as busy as the Starbucks on the corner of Yonge and College. There's also wheelchair access and a dedicated wheelchair-friendly table. The only downside to this location is that they only have \"milk\" or \"cream\" - no skim and no 50/50. But whatever... I'm not that fussy."}
{"text":"I guess everyone is too busy to wait on me! Daria is standing around filling containers and little odd jobs, bit the other guy is very busy making coffee and filtering coffee. No one is here and no lines. Finally Daria comes about 10 ft. away and asks what can I get you? Absolutely no customer service at all! Who's making this child work this summer? She is NOT interested in her own job!"}
{"text":"This Starbucks is adequate. If you're looking for a place for coffee and keeping to yourself this is the place. It does get crowded because of the mall employees. But it's in the morning and mid shifts, I would say. 

If you're looking for great service or service with a smile, I would say no. The staff barely smiles and seems stressed out. They don't laugh or get to know their regulars. I can only think that they've been burned by patrons. 

When they forgot about my discount I asked them if they forgot me and they told me it was my fault for talking to someone when I was being ring up and they were too busy to wait on someone. There weren't too many people here. There was one person behind me- if that. No big deal actually on the discount (it's tiny), but that they put the blame on me was not really customer service. 

I was disappointed because my other Starbucks at fashion show exterior was awesome. I loved going in there to say hi and hang out. This place is just so- so. I would not come here as often because of the people."}
{"text":"Came here to grab a quick snack. I love their Asiago and cheddar pretzel. They can warm it up for you. I didn't take a picture cause I was so hungry I ate it really fast! It was really good although some people have told me it's kind of smelly in a chessy kind of way.

The server was really nice and asked for my name and greeted me and thanked me for coming. Excellent service!"}
{"text":"Really nice outdoor seating area. Inside isn't the biggest and every time I've come the wifi sucks. So slow. The one up next to LVAC is lightning fast as is the location on 215/Jones.  Time to get with it."}
{"text":"This is the worst Starbucks and unfortunately, only location in the Southern Highlands area. The wait time is easily over 20 minutes for a dumb simple drink. You literally better plan 30 minutes of your time to get your coffee."}
{"text":"This Starbucks' drive through is so slow. I pull out of line and leave at least 2x per week because it takes too long."}
{"text":"How does a Starbucks run out of white chocolate?!?! Tell your manager to get with it next time and order what's necessary for popular drinks."}
{"text":"Can I give half a star? This is THE slowest Starbucks I have ever been to. Compared to the other drive thru's I've been to that operate so quickly and swiftly this one takes at least ten minutes per car. Horrible horrible service to top it off. And for some reason they are always out of white chocolate mocha - and their explanation is that all the other ones in Vegas are out too. But when I go to another location and I ask them if they're in stock they look at me like I'm funny. So obviously they are informing customers of the wrong thing. Will probably never return here even though they are convenient."}
{"text":"Love the roomy, friendly, neighbourhood Starbucks that I can walk into right out of the subway.  The modern, urban 'woodsy' decor really does a great job of taking you away from the grey and blah city landscape outside.  Do I really have to leave this coffee-scented heaven for the gloomy weather just past its doorstep?"}
{"text":"This location is so slow. I went here a couple weeks ago with over 30 minutes to spare before class and ended up barely making it. Orders were taken slowly because cashiers chit-chatted for way too long. And the barista (I think her name started with an M) was taking her sweet ol' time. Employees here need to be retrained and put through some speed/efficiency tests."}
{"text":"This location is definitely one of the smallest in town,  
The chairs are not comfy either.

On the plus side, the corner gives great views of the traffic and the people watching is always fun.

The service is OK, but I stop by here to get a grande reserve coffee, the one made by the clover machine.

Intensely strong coffee, take it with a bit of cream with no sugar."}
{"text":"Standard Starbucks location with all the good and bad.

Long wood table for students.

Very few comfy seats all taken by people who are alone.

There is a terrace overlooking Ste-Catherine,  so it's a bit refreshing."}
{"text":"Great staff, with nice chilling ambient upstairs where you can hangout, book a meeting or even study (sometimes music is a bit too loud for that though)"}
{"text":"Drive in is good use a releasable cArd so you can get stuff for just doing what you do friendly and fast."}
{"text":"even without drinking a drop of coffee, i'm a huge fan of starucks. i go there for their amazing hot chocolate. and don't forget the whipped cream, it's the cherry on top of the cake!!!"}
{"text":"One visit and this quickly became one of my favourite Starbucks.

Lots of comfortable seats, very roomy and a nice large with window and terrace.

A few people do appear to squat for hours, some ordering a free cup of water (and bringing their own food) but thats starbucks for ya"}
{"text":"This location must be where they dump all the people from the other locations who cant make a coffee the way you order it ,,totally incapable of getting it right .save your money."}
{"text":"I didn't particularly find the staff all that friendly. There was a big line and only one person manning the register while three other employees where talking in the background not helping.  Also like all other Starbucks they wouldn't do a 50 Cent refill on their coffee like all the other Starbucks. I skip this one but more than likely if you're staying at the Venetian you'll go there anyways."}
{"text":"Service needs a little help. I frequent this location because it is by my job. The last few times have not been great. The lines are ridiculously long and the wait has been long. They usually have been able to get the line down pretty quickly. There are some new faces and their customer service is sub par based on other Starbucks. I ordered a chi tea latte and it was bitter and lukewarm. They spilled the coffee on the cup and didn't bother to clean it. I had to before putting in my cup holder and no apology for the long wait. Just a heads up"}
{"text":"Starbucks is great although not a fan of this layout.  Plus way to many people chillin' for like 2-3 hours straight."}
{"text":"This drive thru was a bit slow but I can understand as its pretty much the last one before you head to Hoover Dam. 

I was able to jump out, use the restroom and get back to my car and still wasn't able to order! 

The inside was huge and had a bunch of seating. 

The AC was on full blast which would explain why it seemed there were a few people just chilling and enjoying the wifi as all the other locations. 

This particular spot was easy to get in and out of as it was about half a mile from the freeway exit. 

I'd be back again if in the area.

Thanks for providing a quick pick me up breakfast and coffee for what was a long day ahead of fun!"}
{"text":"what can I say........IT'S STARBUCKS!!! of course it's great !!!!!"}
{"text":"It's a Starbucks. The lattes where good on timing and what I expected.  I have to knock down the score because I didn't think to put my finger in the $8 ham and cheese sandwiches to make sure they weren't still frozen.  Argh."}
{"text":"The staff here are some of the kindest I have come across at any Starbucks.

There are lots of schools in the area so at peak times (lunch and after school) it can get quite busy, but the line moves along quickly without the quality of food/drinks being compromised.

Also, the bacon & gouda breakfast sandwich is far better than one would expect from a quick-service place such as Starbucks."}
{"text":"Solid Starbucks with grade-A people working there who remember you (for the most part) when you return basically every day.  This Starbucks is inside the Omni William Penn Hotel, so watch out for the ridiculous lines around 8:30/8:45am on weekdays. Some of the cashiers can be grumpy, but wouldn't you be too with loads of caffeine-starved grumpy people pawing about? 

Triple grande americano, anyone? Make it a quad!"}
{"text":"Decent starbucks. Not too crowded and the barista was nice. Though they could turn up the heat a bit more."}
{"text":"Since the rollout of the Order feature on the app, this is always the one I visit for that right before work.  I must say, the Order ahead option is amazing as this place is usually busy.

Every time I've ordered something here it's been done correctly, and when ordered through the app it's been done right on time.

It gets a little crowded and the app still needs to sync up with what specific stores actually have.  I ordered a creme brulee latte only to get there and find out they didn't have that syrup.  There was no way for them to contact me, so the lady made my alternative and also made it a venti for no charge.  That was pretty awesome.

Parking can suck because it does get so busy - watch out for those people in fancy SUVs that never pay attention."}
{"text":"Came in here for an espresso since this was close to my hotel and the lady didn't seem to understand my French when I asked for a shot of espresso with a little milk.

No problem, so I switched to English. 

She still didn't understand so I said nevermind.

Then she tried to charge me for a con panna.

Um, I don't think so.

After going back and forth she finally charged me correctly but she was super rude."}
{"text":"No matter which day I choose to go through the drive-thru, this location seems to always have not only the longest line but the slowest service."}
{"text":"For a smaller Starbucks they offer the blonde espresso which is virtually unheard of. So I love that! The staff here is also some of the friendliest I've come in contact with."}
{"text":"Your average starbucks. Friendly service but almost always busy. It is hard to find an open table here!"}
{"text":"If you're simply looking for a place to rewind with steam forming a must around your eyes, this is the place to be. It's an average Starbucks, not superior nor inferior to the other Starbucks in Vegas but it's decent. I would recommend a grande hot chocolate with the warm buttered croissants that they serve. That is, of course, you aren't stuck in the sweltering heat of Vegas. If it is warmer, the original fizzios are a must try. The ginger ale/ sprite variety is great and the chocolate cake pops are to die for. You can always trust in Starbucks for quality."}
{"text":"Always a different experience I guess it just depends on whose working. Thank goodness for drive through Starbucks!"}
{"text":"No lines! Just steps from the casino and excellent service... Stop here if staying at the hotel or next door. 

Speedy service and served with a smile! 

Thanks for keeping me up and focused..."}
{"text":"Okay, it's Starbucks - what do you need to know? Not much to add, but there's a lot of electrical outlets, good wifi and a drive-thru. The interior is quite nice too, bright with nice artwork. Nice to have a place I can walk to from home. Okay, I guess there were a few things to add."}
{"text":"This is the slowest Starbucks ever, and the staff today (29 Dec 2016 at 2 PM) were the dullest bunch I had ever encountered. 

 I ordered a grande dark roast via mobile app, and I waited for 20 minutes, frequently walking over to the counter to check for my order--my app said that my order should be ready.  I was frustrated because there is no preparation involved in a grande coffee--the barista just has to fill the coffee into the cup and put a lid and sleeve on it.  I assumed that my order was backed up because the staff was too busy with the drive-thru, until someone who ordered long after me got their order.  So then I waited in the queue and then asked the cashier what was going on.

I told him that I ordered a grande dark roast on my mobile app about 20 minutes ago, and he said that they don't brew dark roast after 12 PM, then fetched my order receipt that had been sitting on their counter the whole time I was waiting. I just told him to get the regular roast, and he apologized in a manner of just playing it off as nothing.  

In summary, there were three problems that could have improved this situation, one on my part.

1) I could have forcefully demanded one of the baristas for my drink (adding the fact that all they had to do was pour it into the cup) rather than waiting patiently and assuming they were busy with the drive thru.

2) The baristas could have noticed the many times (4 or 5, I think) that I walked to the pick-up counter, holding up my mobile in the most obvious way possible, and asked if I was Karen, since the receipt was SITTING ON THE COUNTER THE WHOLE TIME.

3) Whoever updates the \"not in stock\" status updates on the mobile app (probably one of the baristas) should have updated the dark roast to be unavailable after 12 PM if they were going to mess with my plans to drink dark roast like that."}
{"text":"Too much changeover with the staff, service is atrocious now. Zero consistency in the drinks, mine tastes completely different with every new person that makes it."}
{"text":"We always come to this Starbucks at least once a month for our early coffee on a weekend . it's a busy place like any other Starbucks. Staff has been friendly. No prob with parking. Love to seat outside  with friendly dogs , watching people as they come n go, We find it relaxing while enjoying my Cafe Latte ."}
{"text":"While the staff seem like nice people (always friendly and smiling, even in the morning!), they consistently prepare my drink poorly. I've ordered a flat white three times before from this location, and each time, the espresso seems too far roasted / burnt. Perhaps inadequate training is the reason why this occurs, as a reviewer mentioned below...

FUN FACT: A barista mentioned that one of they're the most popular mobile ordering location in North America! Not sure if true or not, but there you go!"}
{"text":"I go to Starbucks all over and this one is super slow and super rude. This is def the worst starbucks in town!!! Avoid it like the plague!!!"}
{"text":"I can't pass up the chance to get a cup of snickerdoodle hot chocolate whenever I run across a Starbucks. So when I approach this location I was pretty excited to get \"My usual\". I asked the cashier would the conversion show up on my Starbucks app(since im from the US). She was on knowledgeable about the conversion as well as the Starbucks app. On top of being an employee and not knowing details about the Starbucks app she had the nerve to be rude! I definitely won't be returning to this Starbucks... only giving it a three star because of the quality which is the same in all stores..."}
{"text":"Long, somewhat bizarre layout, hidden location. It's kinda fun, but ultimately, it's just a Starbucks. You probably already know whether or not Starbucks appeals to you and this one isn't likely to change your mind one way or the other."}
{"text":"Oooh la la! Fancy, even for a Starbucks. 

It's definitely a little classier on the inside than some other S'bux spots, but due to that fact, there is also a real lack of seating (then again I went on opening day when it was absolutely packed). 

They do accommodate everyone's seating taste, however. By that I mean there is the little area in the corner with the couch and cushiony seats and tiny tables, next to it is a large table for people with their laptops who prefer more of a study scene, then there are some regular two-person chairs and tables. 
So that's a plus. 

Location is good and was seriously needing a coffee shop other than the italian restaurant and Loblaw's  across the street."}
{"text":"It's cool to have a starbucks there because otherwise there's really just a Tim's and nothing else for poor OISE folks, but because of that, good luck finding a spot. 
Good for takeout, and in theory for sitting in, but not when school's in session."}
{"text":"Gosh, buy a laptop and suddenly you'll visit every Starbucks in the city.

I came here on a lunch break to do some stuff on my laptop. The service was very friendly (!) and quick. Honestly, every time I get a smile from a Starbucks barista, I am surprised. Most of the ones I've dealt with have been just on this side of hostile towards me. Possibly because I don't drink coffee.

I had a blended smoothie that came in a plastic bottle and somehow cost $4 after tax. I very nearly screamed \"WHAT?!\", but swallowed my words, chalked it up to a business expense and paid the lady.

There is a lot of seating, the place is quite spread out, and there are quite a few electrical outlets. Also, there are huge windows in the side, which make the place just more comfortable.

Really, this would be 4 stars if not for the fact that everything is so overpriced."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to kill time. There's quite a bit of seating for such a small spot, bathrooms are clean and staff is friendly enough."}
{"text":"Slowest Starbucks I've been to. So if you plan to go at this location ,  give yourself an extra 30 mins If you have to be somewhere at a certain time . Customer service sucks .  I was waiting at the drive thru to have someone take my order, no one answered so I drove up the window and see kids (employees) inside just hanging around chatting.  I have to knock at the window to get their attention, and the kid said \"you have to order there (pointing at the back)\".  Of course I told him I was waiting there 4-6 mins.  no car in front of me so I don't see why I have to wait that long, and when I drove up the window they were chatting and not paying attention .   I been here many times and the service and long wait has always been the same , so I tried not to go here anymore .   I recommend going to Starbucks located at Las Vegas Blvd and blue diamond or the one at target blue diamond ."}
{"text":"Okay so since the remodel I feel like there was a big improvement! The staff is friendly and efficient! I really dig this Starbucks! Granted I order the easiest drink ever they are still very pleasant."}
{"text":"Staff are extremely kind here, and the wait is reasonable. They have a wide variety of of drinks and desserts. Would definitely recommended getting the pink drink, which is the very berry hibiscus, but replacing water with coconut milk."}
{"text":"Fast workers , great personalities and amazing service . I leave happy every time  =]"}
{"text":"All the stars for the staff, they are always very happy and friendly. But for the past couple months, 90% of the time this location doesn't have chocolate croissants, they say their warehouse is low or something. I've literally stopped coming here and just go to the one up the street on Maryland so I can get my croissant. I'd really like to switch back to being a regular at this location so when this issue's been solved please let me know"}
{"text":"Great location. The drinks are always correct. The staff is bar none the nicest group of people you could come across at a coffee shop. Great way to start the morning."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot to kill time if you have a laptop. I was able to scoop a spot by a power outlet.

Please note, though. The hot chocolate is NOT dairy free. I kind of with the baristas had the presence of mind to check the mix ingredients, even after I told them how I was VERY allergic to dairy."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The guy takes my order but doesn't write it down, so obviously he makes the wrong drink.  He give me full milk,,, and I am a Vegan.  I take it back and I explain the problem so he makes me another one with no caffeine. Wth.  I threw the shit in the trash and didn't go back.  Seriously hire some competent people."}
{"text":"This is my favorite early morning Starbucks Denise knows all her customers by first name and what they ordered previously Great way to start your day! She and the other staff members are very nice."}
{"text":"standard Starbucks. I had the double smoked bacon, egg, and cheese croissantwich and it came out piping hot. the tall coffee tasted as it should.
I came at 7am and there was one other person in line, with at least 2 people working in the front."}
{"text":"Worst. Starbucks. Ever. No explanation needed. I'm pretty sure they are competing with capriottis down the street who will get shut down the fastest. Unfortunately they are still in second place, but tied with the same amount of stars!"}
{"text":"This is seriously the worst Starbucks of all time I've been a Starbucks customer for about 16 years and this by far is the longest I have to wait no matter if they are busy or not it's always a wait it's HORRIBLE. I keep coming here because it's the only one around here."}
{"text":"There's not much to say about this Starbucks other then it's nice. It only recently opened, so everything is still clean, well organized. Staff had a smile on their face as they took my order. This use to be located across the street by Canadian tires and it's a improvement in terms of the size and decor. 

It's probably one of the larger Starbucks I've ever visited and wouldn't mind coming by again for a nice cup of latte."}
{"text":"This store has the best customer service that I have seen at Starbucks' around the area. The only thing that I could ask for is I wish it had a bigger cafe and a clover machine for my favourite kind of coffee. One problem is that the cafe is too small. There are only a few seats so during study season, it's hard to get a spot here."}
{"text":"The barista guy that works here has awesome customer service. Quick to put in orders and chats while putting your order. Friendly guy! Sorry didn't catch his name but he's the bigger guy w beard. Always love Starbucks!"}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience here today. They messed up two of the three items I ordered and when I went back to have my husband's drink corrected (after going home and realizing it wasn't made right), I was treated like I was inconveniencing THEM by asking to have the drink that was made wrong made correctly. And when I said \"thank you\" once I got the right drink, I was brushed off and the barista didn't even acknowledge I was standing there let alone said anything to me. 

I went through the drive thru when I originally ordered the drinks and they have a sign up that says they want to be the fastest Starbucks in the city so to please order your food items first. I had a quick initial experience but ended up wasting 20 minutes having to go back to have my order (rudely) remade. Fast service at the cost of quality and customer service? No thanks. I'll go across the street to the Starbucks inside the Albertsons from now on."}
{"text":"This location was nice enough to visit. Not my first choice of Starbucks although I do appreciate its location in Tuscany. 
It takes longer than usual for orders to be rung through and made, at least on this particular day. I got to try a pumpkin spice latte finally and was pleased. (sweet though!)
It was also noisy, full of kids that were not exactly being well managed by their guardians. It made a coffee visit with a friend a little challenging!
Perhaps short staffed, but staff really needed to do some quick sweeping and wiping here and there. We wiped down our own table and tried to avoid the floor gunk.
Limited seating but good light inside.
Try a little piece of pumpkin loaf with your coffee - so good!"}
{"text":"They're really friendly. It's small and barely no seats but I don't mind that. Right at greektown. And usually not crazy busy"}
{"text":"Starbucks corporate people.... please step up your game! I was pleasantly surprised to see a Starbucks in Caesar's Palace, they are located in the Augustus tower.  I was salivating all morning thinking about a strong cup of Joe and delish pastry, until I visited.  I ordered my usual, an Americano, and when I went to the sugar and creamer counter... there is NO SUGAR IN THE RAW.  Really?  Not only am I getting charged an extra $1 + for all items because its a Starbucks in Vegas, and everything is overpriced, but NO SUGAR IN THE RAW. Get it together, people. If you're going to charge extra, please have our condiments available!"}
{"text":"Avoid this location! Take the extra drive to the Starbucks inside Target that's a couple miles away. 

This location never fails to disappoint me. I always try to give them a chance, but I'll still get the same outcomes. Drinks taste watered down from all the ice they put. It's like I pay $5-6 for a tall in a venti cup. I can't even count the times my drinks are made wrong. The employees seem to lack communication because a lot of these reviews are about drinks made wrong. Customer service fluctuates, sometimes they're nice, sometimes not.

I hope something gets done to fix the problems, but I don't think they will because it just seems like they don't care."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location since it opened. I'd like to be able to justify a 5star review but can't. Their service is consistently hit or miss. Sometimes the crew working is completely customer centered and kicking out drinks at record speed. Other times they are so slow, unfriendly and have a total checked out attitude and you're left looking around trying to understand why. Other times the speed is quick but the crew is completely self absorbed and chatting each other up that hey barely notice the customers. 
They are usually well stocked on all of the items you'd garb out of the coolers, and have an average selection of gift items on display. Cleanliness isn't usually a problem in the main area or the restrooms. 
Drinks and orders are usually all on point, even if the wait can be a bit much at time. (The drive through can literally get 10+ cars deep) Mobile ordering is my favorite and I've only had to wait beyond the estimated time once."}
{"text":"I like it here.  It's a small shop, and it gets quite busy in the mornings, but there's a very good selection of reserve blends and seasonal items.  The staff is largely great, but there are a few members who treat customers rudely (unacceptable).  There are also times when, despite being empty, the service is incredibly slow (again, it's not the majority of staff, only a small handful)."}
{"text":"It's 50/50 whether I get friendly service at this location. It's never bad service. My drinks are made correctly and efficiently but the staff is either super perky and personable or portraying the persona of wishing they were elsewhere."}
{"text":"The first thing you'll notice about this location when you walk in is the line up. It's almost always there. Luckily, the second thing you'll notice is how quickly it tends to move.

Smack dab in the middle of North Toronto (just a few short blocks north of Lawrence) this Starbucks has it all - a large service area, a robust wall of retail goodies rife with plush toys and gourmand gadgets, and an adjacent lounge with seats, sofas and free WiFi for all.

Despite the size and the crowd, this isn't a noisy location. Helped in part by keeping the seating and ordering areas separate, this Starbucks is a welcome retreat for java junkies and mobile business types alike."}
{"text":"Starbucks is usually pretty good to me but this time the noise level due to the music was a bit high which made the people louder which made it harder to hear the person i was hanging out with.  Now put that aside, and the blonde coffee was spot on, the pastry was awesome, my colleague thought about the same as i did about their experience, and i must say the staff was extra friendly and efficient.   Maybe its just me but usually when i go to Starbucks I'm trying to escape the office.  So I'm oblivious to whats around me.  Anyhow, ya, i will return like a faithful mutt, and yes i enjoyed my time there.  But most impressive is the young lady and her perky personality who took our order, now that is a model employee which any service industry would be proud to have as the director of first impressions."}
{"text":"In and out quickly, and my hot chocolate was just the way i like it, so its all good.  With a squirt of this and a sprinkle of that, and lets take the chill out of this cold and wet day.  A vanilla bean scone to top it all off and I'm back on the road.  I would have liked to sit and enjoy the ambiance but duty calls, so maybe next time the office is hectic i will scoot over for some solitude and a coffee."}
{"text":"Poor to average Bux. Not happy it's my closest one.

Sometimes it's cleanish. Sometimes the staff are friendly. Those are things that can be corrected. 

The patio is too small and the only windows are up front so it's a bit of a cave. Those, unfortunately, are probably not fixable."}
{"text":"This place is probably one of the slowest Starbucks in the USA. The drive thru is always packed and so is the inside. Place has 3 bars and always only one working."}
{"text":"Thanks for not only strangly closing the drive-thru at 9 without having a sign out by the speaker but then closing your location 20 minutes early so when I tried to walk in the three employees inside looked at me as if I was imposing on them for even trying to open the locked door! I'm no rocket scientist but the whole point of having store hours are for customers to know when they can actually buy goods or services from you. I will make sure to avoid this location in the future as I know the other ones I could have went to were actually open during the hours they say they are!"}
{"text":"The downside to this Starbucks location is that it is right beside the gas station and the patio isn't the most relaxing and scenic because it's also beside the Canadian Tire.  The seating area inside the Starbucks is a little cluttered especially towards the back.  They have high top stool set up in the bar area but that is also where people wait for their drinks.  However, the upside to this Starbucks is that they are always fully staffed so the line up isn't too bad and they always make an effort to call you by your first name and most of the staff are energetic and engaging.  They always make my coffee - nice & hot, just the way I like it.  With all my past experiences with mobile pick ups, it's always made before I arrive and I never have to wait.  Overall, I'd say if you're looking for a relaxing coffee shop, I would not recommend this particular location.  But because I usually come here out of convenience, I would say this Starbucks is mediocre with pretty fast service."}
{"text":"Danny, the manager of this store is amazing! His coworkers mostly personally trained by him are top notch attention to detailed employees that only make starbucks shine even more in their glory!!! Love love love this store"}
{"text":"Best Starbucks drive thru I've ever ben through and I've been through A LOT! Starbucks coffee and tea is killer which we all know. What sells me on this Starbucks is the AMAZING customer service and the timeliness of orders. I've never waited more than five minutes for an order when the line has been extremely long. If there has been a wait, they apologize. Everyone is always smiling and willing to help."}
{"text":"I was there twice in the last three days. Encountered I think their manager who was frantically running around the place. I waited over 10 minutes for a simple ice tea. When I questioned that my drink was late and might have been forgotten she said, we're busy. Welcome to Starbucks! In an exasperated tone I would not drive out of my way for that experience again."}
{"text":"As a former partner I'm very disappointed with this location. Every time my drink lacks quality and taste. Shots are burnt, it's hot when it's supposed to be iced. I understand that you get a different barista on bar but the store manager/managers needs to be actively checking and making sure what is ordered is correct and what goes out the window is made to a high standard. This store doesn't have good reviews so that goes to show they are careless. Hopefully the partners and managers at this store will step it up and relearn how to make a good cup coffee and take care of paying customers. I feel like I'm throwing my money away when I get a drink here."}
{"text":"Location is perfectly in plain site of Davisville Station.  Great layout with wonderful, relaxed seating available on the second floor.  the main floor is packed with sipping customers and merchandise. The service line curls around but...its lovely and of course the coffee is delicious!

I am sure to go back!"}
{"text":"The team that works here makes this one of the best Starbucks around.  The service is always fast with some great banter along the way.  I always stop in for my morning coffee when I am in the area."}
{"text":"I come here often as I sometimes work in the building. The lobby of the William Penn is gorgeous, and I would come to this particular Starbucks even if I wasn't working in the building. The staff is usually very friendly, and though the lines can be really long during the morning rush, they have an efficient system and things move quickly.

It's easy to pay through the Starbucks app on your phone here, and unlike some locations that give you a hard time, the staff here always thanks me for using my Starbucks app!

This location is great for sitting with a laptop that get some work done, but avoid the morning rush as it can get very loud.

I was very pleased with my double tall soy one pump hazelnut latte this morning. Some locations are known for their bitter lattes, but my latte this morning was perfectly smooth and enjoyable."}
{"text":"I'm an avid Starbucks fan (I go daily and sometimes twice a day on weekdays!), but I've had several bad service experience at this location. One instance was when I ordered iced coffee and after I had paid and was waiting for the drink, I was told by the barista that they are out of iced coffee. He offered to make me an iced americano instead and I have had iced americanos before and it is just not something I like. I opted to ask for my other go-to drink, which is a latte. He rudely pointed out that this is a completely different drink to which I replied hat you did not inform me that you were out of iced coffee when I ordered and paid. Had I been informed I would have ordered something different. He then asked me to pay for the difference, which was not a problem for me. However, I felt like he insinuated that I was trying to get a more expensive drink which I was not. I go to Starbucks regularly and was shocked by this service. He also seemed to be the most senior person at the location so I could not escalate a complaint at the store. A separate incident that happened at this location was that they refused to honour a Facebook Starbucks offer even though I showed them the offer on my Facebook page on my phone. Unfortunately this is the location closest to my condo. I can't wait for another location in the Yonge and Sheppard area!!"}
{"text":"I always pop in here between the Porter shuttle and Union Station. It's a small Starbucks, and sometimes is crowded, but it has a nice patio space when the weather is good. It's far enough off the street that you don't feel as if all the passerbyers are in your face. 

The staff her are really awesome. The last time I was in they were so friendly and funny that I had a bellyful of laughs all the way from the cash to the barrista bar. I good dependable Starbucks location in my books."}
{"text":"They are a lot more expensive then other Starbucks, $8 for a frap, typical for a franchise on the strip and anything we tried to order, they were out of. Wasn't worth it. We should've  just went to the bar and got a cocktail. Barista was nice at least. I can't say anything bad about the customer service."}
{"text":"This place sucks. They are slow and illiterate. I work at Caesars and they are rude to employees and make us late to return from work. They are also more expensive than other TOURIST price Starbucks locations. You're better off going to the Mirage a short walk away for better service and prices."}
{"text":"I've never visited this location, I was in a different route today. I love the Starbucks in usually go to. The strangest thing happened today. I began to get grossed out after I ordered and got closer to the window and saw the man handing out food in drink with a long beard and very greasy hair, all uncovered. I tried to stomach past it. When I got to him I laid him in cash. He said he had no change and was going to pay me in $10 worth of quarters. I told him that was not ok and he needed to get me cash, no coins. He left the window, cane back and said the quarters were all he had. I said I wouldn't leave where I was without cash. He then produced two five dollar bills almost immediately. I'm still so confused by the whole transaction. I've never been handed $10 worth of quarters for change in my life. He next gave me my food and drinks. The drinks were good, the food tasted as if it had been sitting for hours which I didn't eat because I suspect he might've given me an old sandwich for making him get me change.  I'll drive the extra couple of miles next time to avoid this Starbucks."}
{"text":"The good is that it's a Starbucks. It has a drive thru, which is rare in these parts. And it's a good location (personally) for when I'm coming back from work or errands on the west side.

I don't normally give Starbs a 4-star unless they have a glaring flaw. For this place, it's the setup. It is SO small. I would not feel comfortable sitting here to work because the remodel is dark and the space is made to feel even more enclosed by the island bar they put in the only area of the store that could have been spacious...and then they took that island and made an entire wall to go with it, unnecessarily. The outdoor seating is a strip against the front side of the building, which also feels incredibly too small."}
{"text":"This new Starbucks location at the Venetian/ Palazzo (right by the Sands Convention and Venetian ticket office) is a comforting sight. The space is huge and nicely decorated. The staff is friendly. Nice!"}
{"text":"Love this Starbucks !! Shannon is an amazing barista & I love all the smiling faces in the drivethru !"}
{"text":"There are 3 Starbucks within a one mile distance in downtown Cleveland. But this one is located Tower City, and who doesn't enjoy Starbucks? The more the merrier. 

There's always a line but the employees at this location have been friendly and pleasant. 

The area is sketchy and I would suggest going to another Starbucks unless you have something to do at Tower City."}
{"text":"I mean this is a starbucks like any starbucks but the staff here is so FRIGGEN NICE!!! Every time i come they're just so sweet. They have 3 booths which are pretty much always full and 2 bigger tables which are good for studying, then a bunch of small round tables, there are usually a few of those available."}
{"text":"i don't think i've ever written a starbucks review as the starbucks standard is pretty high across the board. However, this location definitely fell short for me. They took much longer than expected to make my tea (there was no one else in the store at the time) and when they did get it ready there was honey all over the outside of the cup so my hands got sticky. This location definitely needs to up their game if they want to maintain the high starbucks standard."}
{"text":"The staff here are always incredibly friendly and helpful, more than most locations I've been to. They are attentive and quick. The only problem is that it's a very small location with limited seating, so it's tough to find somewhere to sit at any time of day. It isn't really set up for working, as some locations are, more for socializing or a quick catch-up."}
{"text":"This branch deserves more than a 2.5 star. The baristas are super friendly and they try very hard to make the drinks on time. They sometimes come into the building to promote the drinks. One thing they may need to improve is the limited seating arrangement that's just awkwardly placed on the side. What's supposed to be a two-seater table is often taken up by one person. As for their mobile app,I typically avoid ordering from it anyways as it seems to have yet surpass its trial stage."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by on my way to work. I ordered the White Chocolate Mocha and decided to get breakfast as well. I decided to try there new Spicy Chorizo, Monterey Jack & Egg Breakfast Sandwich. Judging by the picture it looked like a normal breakfast sandwich, until I had my first bite. The pork patty wasn't even cooked completely. I literally felt like I was going to throw up. And I wasn't expecting that, from now on I will stick to Timmies for my breakfast sandwich. 

Overall, the staff was super friendly. As well as the drink was just the way I like it."}
{"text":"Vraiment bien situé, à l'angle de St Denis et Ontario, il est pratique pour se rencontrer entre amis, ou prendre un café à emporter avant d'aller travailler
Il y a souvent du monde, notamment des étudiants ou des professionnels qui travaillent sur leur laptop
Bon service, pas trop d'attente"}
{"text":"Brand spanking new Starbucks with a drive through. Love it. Not a lot of parking though (and sometimes the customers tend to take up more than their fair share if space... I was in yesterday and 2 high schoolers had sprawled across 5 spaces and had their feet up across other benches. Really?!?) But this loc is just fine. You know what you are getting when you come to a Starbucks and this one is just like the last one. And the next one. It's bigger , the people are friendly , coffee is good and the drive thru makes it more convenient."}
{"text":"Super small and tiny, but does the job. Only 3 actual tables near the front entrance for you to work in and a bar with high stools, also to work and snack, but doesn't seem comfy for long term. 

It's so snug that only max two people can be standing waiting for drinks, especially if there are patrons on this bar area. 

Foursquare asked me when I checked in, if this was suitable for a date, and no. However, this was in the middle of December. In the summer I imagine a very large patio space, and your only real option of a decent cafe in this area with such a thing, unless you head over to Bayview. 

Just be careful when you park, of the giant trucks pulling into the gas station , that you don't get run over."}
{"text":"Just got home from a long day, with the roads being unbearable but I figured a nice warm venti gingerbread latte with an extra shot would hit the spot. I pulled up to the drive through ordering that drink and a white chocolate mocha with an extra shot, pulled up to the window the guy didn't greet me at all, just verified the total took my card, gave me my card and drinks. Initially the drinks both felt lighter than usual. Since the roads were bad I was unable to check to see how full they were until I hit a stop light. I opened the lid and it was half full....this service is ridiculous I paid $5.50 for this drink and it's half of what I ordered. Never going here again, day ruined."}
{"text":"The location is supremely convenient inside Tower City, right at the mouth of the wall. I had a holiday drink, it took a little while to get served but it turned out pretty tasty. Good place to chill with a group."}
{"text":"My wife took me here at the tail end of a date night.  I'm not a coffee drinker so Starbucks is a rare stop for me.

First, finding parking was ridiculous due to Moxies being across the way.  A woman driving around not paying attention almost ran into my car

Once we got inside it was a Starbucks.  Except unlike the ones at Indigo this one was cramped and cluttered.  Boxes of product were strewn across the floor.  The stereotypes were in attendance: two wussy looking metro men with laptops and no Starsbucks product on their table; a bride to be and her friend

We ordered our drinks.  My wife had a cappuccino and I had a mint hot chocolate.  My wife's drink was ready lickity split.  However in my case my hot choc took almost fives minutes to prep.  It would be nice if they had spoons to eat the whipped cream off of the top.

Overall I'd give it an ok rating.  The drinks were good, not great.  The staff was there to put in time, and the messy appearance of the store was an ambience breaker."}
{"text":"It's so pretty. I think this was a bank converted into a Starbucks. 

Uber high ceilings with large ceiling fans. Lots of seating and plugs everywhere. 

There's also a patio! 

But the parking lot beside doesn't technically belong to the Starbucks. If you're staying here longer term, go park across the street at Loblaw.

Did you know there's a VAULT in here? Apparently the space can be booked with the barista (not sure if you have to show up or call), and has seating for about 8. Might get stuffy in there, but would be good for a small group work meeting or collaboration"}
{"text":"Yay, they finally opened up a Starbucks walking distance from me! It gets +! star for a great location pick. The closest one before this was.... Dupont and Christie (Really?!) or Bloor and Avenue in the Winners.

Long and narrow, it's not the typical layout. I love the high high ceilings and exposed industrial piping. It's doesn't give that cozy vibe with the plush brown leather sofas but it does seem like a productive place to do work. Maybe, if you don't feel claustrophobic. 

I bet there will be line ups out the door this weekend at Nuitblanche."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location 3-5 times a week for just over 3 years to buy my fiancé and I coffee. We order the same drinks every time ( Iced coffee and a white mocha ), nothing too specialized. At least once a week we need one fixed or remade ( too much ice, put whipped cream when it wasn't ordered, etc.). Today, both coffees were wrong. When I informed the barista, she met my complaint with an immediate attitude - something that I have never experienced at any Starbucks. She fixed one of them, but made the second one wrong twice more. I finally set that one that she couldn't get right on the counter walked out without even getting my money back. I bet Starbucks could stop raising prices if they could get the orders right the first time! After three years of frustration, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Average Starbucks. Slow drive-thru and needed me to repeat my order three times."}
{"text":"There is now a new Starbucks location in the Northwest corner of Bayview Village (formerly a Timothy's). 

Service is always good, nothing to complain about. Except they don't write my name on my cup anymore. I thought I was special :(

Protip - There is an outdoor patio"}
{"text":"Extremely Rude!!! 

My friends & I are on holiday in Vegas for a couple weeks. We are avid Starbucks customers no matter where we travel to. Went inside about 15mins before closing hour. First off 3 people were on the clock but they all ignored us for about a minute, probably to see if we would just leave so they can close shop. A gal took our order, we purchased 3 drinks. It took all 3 employees, 15mins to make these & they made 1 drink incorrectly. During the process the 2 female employees were talking trash over the headsets while making stink faces at us. SO RUDE!!! Never going back there again. Worse service ever. Never been so insulted."}
{"text":"4 stars for the great service we received from Bree!

The chestnut praline latte is one of their best holiday beverages!! Got grande the first time. What a mistake!  Did it right the second time around and ordered it venti! Yes, it's that good!

Now I just need to remember to recharge my starbucks card so that I can earn my stars! Shooting for Gold stars in 2015!!

Drive through available at this location and plenty of parking spaces available."}
{"text":"This is literally the slowest Starbucks that I have ever been to. They take forever to make drinks when no one is even in there because they are gossiping about other employees. Don't waste your time. Go to the Starbucks in Fry's they are very quick. @"}
{"text":"Took a very long time to order and get my drink (iced coffee) even though there was only one guy ahead of me who ordered hot tea and brewed coffee. The woman working here seemed extremely frazzled, like she may have just finished up a rush of customers or, more likely, like it was her first day worki alone. Having said that, I gave this location four stars because of how nice the barista was. I'll wait a little extra for good service because I've been to other locations where I am in and out within a matter of minutes, but the baristas are very rude. What she lacked in speed she made up for in politeness! Good place to get some coffee if you're already in the grocery store anyway."}
{"text":"Avoid at all costs!  Very small location, and the lineups sometimes go out the door.  If you want to be greeted by your boss when you return to work after your coffee \"break\" tapping his feet, and tapping on his watch, then brave it and come to this Starbucks... Or, if you want to burn yourself on the way back from the coffee you had to get extra hot so that by the time you darted back to your office it'd still be enjoyable... There are plenty of other nearby locations, steer clear!"}
{"text":"This is the closest location to my place so I go here often. Staff's normally pleasant. I've only gone inside once and they were pretty rude, so it's the drive thru for me now. Not much of a long wait. I'm weird so even during the summer I drink hot coffee. Never a problem there. I tried the treat receipt or whatever it is called and ordered a cold beverage (passion something?)  it was really watered down. Not refreshing at all. I'll stick with my white chocolate mocha, at least they know how to make that right."}
{"text":"This Starbucks is inside of the Safeway which is close to work for me. When I need a quick pick-me-up in the afternoon or around lunch time I can come here because it soooooo close to work. They always get my drink right and while I am not a HUGE fan of the taste of Starbucks coffee, its always fresh and they are reliable. =) The staff has always been polite and helpful as well.  They do sell pasteries and there is a seating area if you want to have the coffee in the store. I haven't done that as I usually head over quickly to grab a drink to go, then head back to the office."}
{"text":"This place gets swamped with people regularly throughout the day because of its central location for all the hospitals and Case. I don't envy the jobs the people who work here have because when it gets busy customs can be unnecessarily rude to the staff. They do the best they can! 

There isn't the most seating inside, but I usually use the Starbucks app for ordering my drink so I can avoid the line and get in and out quickly. They almost always have my drink done and sitting on the counter by the registers by the time I walk in (only about 3-5 minutes). 

Overall, I don't think University Circle would function half as well as it barely does without this Starbucks here!"}
{"text":"the best about this Starbucks are baristas. they will always make your day better. and the place has a patio. yay!"}
{"text":"This Starbucks is one of the more ornate locations that I have visited.  I enjoying the decor with the crystal chandeliers and all but besides the furniture there is nothing else remarkable to report about this location."}
{"text":"Giving this Starbucks location a better rating since my last review. I've been utilizing Mobile Order, and I no longer have complaints of the long wait. I still notice long lines of cars and people at certain times of the day, but I guess I should thank them for not knowing about Mobile order. Lol. Not to be mean, but if they all knew about it, then Mobile Order would take longer than the 3 min I have to just drive there and pick up my order right away.  

---------------------
20-25 min for one drink. I understand there are lots of customers at a given time, but there's gotta be a way to push these drinks out a little faster. Southern Highlands needs another Starbucks"}
{"text":"One of the busiest Starbucks I'm sure of it. But also insanely quick. So no complaints there. It can be lined up to the door and I've never waited longer than 5-10 minutes. So props to efficiency. 

Good staff, know their stuff, and still pleasant. It's a Starbucks, they're pretty much all the same. Over priced coffee and yummy lattes. LOL."}
{"text":"I love this Starbucks location! Everyone here is so nice and takes pride in their jobs. This is a great location for studying or just reading a book some lazy afternoon. One of my favorite locations!"}
{"text":"I actually was going to start this review just like Jennifer K... .
There's tons of room in here, possibly they could even fit more seating in here if they wanted to. 

However, despite that, most people here are staying put and you might find it hard to get a seat. Lots of open flaps. 

The staff here was meh. Maybe it was an off day, but I got a little attitude. 

Free parking in the lot,"}
{"text":"This is the slowest Starbucks location I have ever been to. The staff seems to be in a good mood and they're constantly joking back and forth with each other perhaps too much. It generally takes quite a bit before I will actually make a negative review but I feel an intervention is necessary. I have completely stopped going to this location opting to go without my coffee because of the service times"}
{"text":"Great Starbucks! The staff is ALWAYS friendly and helpful. Big thumbs up to that.

Baristas here are always pleasant. If they mess up your drink, they replace it immediately with the correct one and give you a certificate for a free one next time.

Store is clean and well organized. 

Sometimes some odd characters in here but that's to be expected in a coffee shop in a metropolitan area. All seem harmless."}
{"text":"This is the only Starbucks near Ikea and the airport I could find which actually has room inside to sit down! The other ones nearby were either drive through, or in grocery stores."}
{"text":"Starbucks used to be the benchmark darling of the coffee world but now has slunk into a back alley where mainstream-boring and lousy drinks hang out. 
The whole beans for home consumption are still good, as their darker beans have more kick than almost anyone else's (not surprisingly, blond or light-medium seems what Canadians prefer), but the competition is fierce, and easily as good or better elsewhere. 
Their darkest roasts are both bitter and burnt! How this continues I don't know, but they must be selling them to certain people. 
I no longer go there for a latte or for much of anything.

Early on they started playing games with mostly ignorant customers by not selling the full shot of espresso! They'd pull the 2-spout shot but only serve up half of it for a short or tall! The other they dumped out (duh!), and if we wanted the full shot, we'd have to pay more for the 'extra shot', or order the more expensive 'grande' or 'vente' sizes! 
When I asked the Starbuck's VP of Sales and Marketing about this practice in person one day at a branch in the Philippines, he sheepishly said something super lame that lacked substance, but it's obviously a slick marketing strategy designed to pad the bottom line for the larger drinks. Oh yes, none of the good stand-alone coffee shops in Canada or Asia that I know of play this silly game!
As well, around 2006 they replaced their great manual machines with automatics that couldn't pull a decent shot even after repeated attempts. Sad business practices, and not 'fair trade' at all!
Their pastries and sandwiches are generally not very exciting either (some have odd textures and flavours), and yet, oddly enough, are outstripped by those in Asia!

Starbucks in Calgary, Alberta, Canada?
In the 4th Street scene, check out The Purple Perk or Phil & Sebastian first!
On or near eclectic 17th Ave., check out Cafe Beano, Analog Coffee or Philosafy first!   
In Market Mall, walk north toward the food court and check out Deville first! You get a free drink with every bag of whole beans.
In Chinook Mall, head far north and check out Phil & Sebastian's or Nordstrom's Ebar first!
They ALL are much better!

Starbucks in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada?
On 104th Street downtown, check out Credo first! Yummy.
On 124th Street in Westmount, check out Duchess Bake Shop first! Great baking and super high-end chocolate.
On 109th Street near High Level bridge, check out Transcend Coffee.
On the funky eastern side of Whyte Avenue, check out Remedy. Their curry lunches are very good also.
Each much better!

Too bad, Starbucks, but you've sold out by going soft, ripping off your customer base, and becoming exceedingly commercial. 
How commercial?
Anyone can buy ground (!) Starbucks coffee beside Nescafe, Nabob and Folger's drek in many supermarkets now. 
Chasing the buck more than ever is the star of their show!"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars, I would.  This place is a disgrace to Starbucks.  There are generally 4 people working behind the counter and somehow it takes them 25 minutes to make my drink... there were 17 people behind me that got their drinks first and mine was just a Refresher!  How hard is it to put the mix in and add ice?  I watched the lady calling names look at my drink and ignore it whilst calling others drinks... I was getting so annoyed because I was almost late for class!  I have never received my drink from this location in less than 10 minutes and to me, this is embarrassing for Starbucks.  Fire everyone and start all over!"}
{"text":"I stopped to get two caramel fraps (one for me one for my husband). No one told me I could do two separate transactions to earn more stars (wish I would have read here first). I felt so rushed to order and then had to wait quite a while because of the long line a head of me that already ordered before me. The people working there were rushing to get everyone's orders taken care of, at least that was nice. When my drinks were done, to my disappointment, I barely had any whip cream on top.  I love to eat the whip cream and caramel on top before drinking the drink. I like their sense of urgency but maybe take some time to make sure the quality of the drink isn't affected."}
{"text":"Wow I don't even know where to begin but I'll tell you the reason why I gave a 1 star. If anything, the service I received today is deserving of zero stars. First off, I go to Starbucks all the time but this one was by far the worst experience of them all and usually starbucks employees are always pleasant When i made my order the lady had no smile but rather a b*tch face on her and a mean attitude... i felt as if she was being rscist (im asian by the way) I told her my order and she wasn't even listening (i asked for caramel macchiato less foam  on decaf and lactose-free milk) never even asked for my name but there was a line up behind me. How do they even know what my order is. Also she got my order completely wrong. Like I said, I ordered a caramel macchiato decaf lactose free. My husband also ordered his latte. When both orders came out they were wrong and I told the lady nicely ... and by the way I even said \"I'm so sorry but you got my order wrong and if it's ok to change it to my requested order.\" The girl who made my order at the counter also had a b*tch face and had the audacity to get pissed off... she threw the milk into the sink with an attitude and banged everything into the sink as if she was pissed off at me for getting my order wrong. I don't normally write this type of review but this one had to be heard. I most likely will never ever come back to the Starbucks ever again I really think the people at the counter are either racist or pissed off at their boss, ... who knows. Or maybe they could just be having a bad day but if you're working in this type of Industry you shouldn't be taking it out on your customers. This must be a management issue and management needs to correct this otherwise they'll have more bad reviews like this one. The service industry should not be taking it out on their customers. Management should be talking to their employees to correct this behaviour. I still left the Starbucks shop saying thank you to the lady who fixed my order with an attitude ... hopefully they'll have a better day before the day ends."}

Very hard to get to if travelling west, easy if heading downtown. Plenty of staff to get you through quickly. If you like SB, its fine. If you don, well there is an Ancora coffee the next block over. Which has better coffee, but no rewards program, and even fewer food choices"}
{"text":"The only reason I come here is because it's on my way to work, but today was my last time. They mess up my order EVERY TIME. They don't seem to know the difference between soy and dairy milk, and I get a different drink every time even when I always order chai frapp.

Come here only if you like overpriced plain coffee, because that's the only thing they don't fuck up.

This particular location sucks."}
{"text":"When shopping if I'm in the mood for green tea, this location is super convenient. Can't really give more than 3* though the Baristas are always friendly and there's usually a special running. 

If you really want to sit in Von's with your beverage of choice/munchie there's a counter a few feet away by Panda Express and the ready made meal section. Also some extra seating outside between Von's & Bath BW. 

In all, ok if you are in a rush: need a caffeine boost, or can't wait till you leave the supermarket to eat/drink. Kinda weird to me but seems to be trend out here; fast food courts within markets. AOk

{"text":"I really like this spot to drink coffee because you can sit outside, see the water, enjoy the lake breeze and be protected from the elements. Usually things are super cheerful and easy-going here, but I just waited for 20 minutes in line for a cup of black coffee.

I really, really don't like to diss places for a one-off less-than-stellar service moment - it happens, we've all been there - but I was kind of dumbfounded today, so:

There were only two people working, one one the cash and one preparing, and it was busy, so I was willing to cut these servers some serious slack. When both of them started taking forever helping one customer decide what to have, which involved a breakdown of what that customer had tried before, what ingredients they like, sweetness levels, etc., I tried to appreciate the high level of attention paid to the experience of that customer. But then I started losing my patience because I noticed that that degree of attention to one customer produced a very noticeable lack of service to myself and the other customers in the ever-growing line-up. Still, everyone was very pleasant, so what's a few minutes, and then a few more.

I finally made it to the front just as 2 MORE servers came out from the back - I was like fuuuuck, finally. Just starting their shift? Or taking breaks at the same time even though it was so busy up here? They each did some punching on the registers, then proceeded to chat with the original servers and wander here and there instead of focusing directly on whittling down the line-up (I was still at the front of the line and still hadn't ordered). Then ANOTHER guy came from the back (clown car back there ?) and it was just painful at this point to watch the 5 employees mill about chatting ... in the end my order was taken by one of the original servers.

Incredibly inefficient for a place with 5 people on staff at once. Again, maybe this was a fluke and this was a shift changeover. If not, some tweaking of the work flow might be in order."}
{"text":"its small and seats might be hard to find.  Everytime I come here the line ups are long and it doesnt fare well for the quick coffee grab. 

Lots of teas and coffee paraphenlia if you are looking forthe gift. 

Free parking if you can properly dodge all the crazy drivers."}
{"text":"A very comfortable Starbucks ... consistent good staff and service.  The roof top patio ... is always a favourite for me after the long winter. (It does not get the best sun light ... but it is one of the few patio's in Calgary ... and one of the first to open after our 'wonderful' winters.   // They have remodelled the floor space a couple of years ago now ... and I'm still not as big a fan of this seating arrangement as the 'old way'. (I'm getting old and stodgy.)

Easy parking (most of the time) behind the building. Lots of reasons to be in this area ... banking (RBC and BOM), Spinning, Yoga, Rowing, Masters Art Gallery, Shoppers Drug Market, Sewing Alteration place near by ... and of course many superb restaurants."}
{"text":"Even though I never go to Starbucks, this is a nice location. It's homey and it's right next to a bookshop. No complaints about the service or the selection, it's a Starbucks just like any other. I think Starbucks is worth going only when they have big promotions, like half off drinks or member only prizes. 

The member system gives you free refills on tea or coffee if you are planning on staying the whole day. On your birthday you also get a free drink. I think those are pretty fun promotions."}
{"text":"Small, busy coffeeshop locate two blocks north of the busy intersection of Yonge Street and St. Clair Avenues.  Typical Starbucks, but unlike other locations, this one is extremely busy all week long.  It's a challenge finding a seat here, but once you do, it's a great way to relax and meet other coffee lovers. I would have given this place 4 stars had it not been for the busy nature of this location, but otherwise, it's a nice neighborhood joint to check out."}
{"text":"Never thought I would review a Starbucks. What could go wrong, they serve drinks and package food. Simple, right? Nope! I ordered a black tea. While I am ordering a girl comes in who is obviously friends with the workers and is talking with everyone. After I finished my order, she placed hers. Guess what, she got her two mixed drinks before I got my black tea. When I asked about mine, one guy said yes I'm making it now. Great I thought. Then I was given a green tea with steamed milk. I mentioned I had ordered a black tea, which after several minutes of completing others orders, it was made. It's never taken 10 minutes for one drink, especially when I am the only one waiting."}
{"text":"I go to this Starbucks a lot because it is close to my house. It is one of the only Starbucks I've found in Henderson that has a drive thru which is very confinement for me. The drive thru service is super fast and everyone is always friendly. My drinks are always made delicious. I have never had a problem here."}
{"text":"I normally don't go to this location , but this lady in the drive through was rushing me to get my drink , I looked behind thinking I had lots of cars , not one car behind me , I put my order and she asked me if I wanted a receipt , before I could reply she just walks off and assumed I didn't need one , she must be new to customer service or maybe she just had a bad day , either way she shouldn't be in the drive through or cashier for that matter. I think I'll go to a different location next time , too bad this one was closer to my house."}
{"text":"My order is never ready at the counter after I've ordered through the Starbucks app. Almost every single time, I've had to get someone's attention and ask for my drink only to find out that they never grabbed the order from the register. The point of using the mobile app to order is to have the drink ready at the counter by the time you get there instead of waiting 5-10 minutes for a drink."}
{"text":"I went here to get coffee with my starbucks reward gold card. When i left, i realized that there was a mistake with my balance so i called them to look into it. The one who picked up the phone said she is so busy and that she'd call me back.  2 weekd later.. No call. Very rude."}
{"text":"Not sure what to say.  This is one busy Starbucks in Square One but they treat you the exact same.  However, what is pretty neat is that if you are close enough, they have wi-fi that you can use even though you are in the food court. 

More of a \"pick up my coffee and shop\" type place as opposed to sit down and relax  or as I used to call it with my ex - \"thank god I can stop shopping and do something that will make my tummy happy\" coffee shop. :-)"}
{"text":"Omg.. Rose is seriously the best barista I have ever come across. She was so personable and the drinks she made were probably the best I've had in a very long time. I think it's crap they aren't allowed to take tips,  she deserves a raise!"}
{"text":"Excelente cafe 
Mi cafe con vainilla siempre en su punto
Me gusta pasar todas las ma?anas por el 
Y suempre encuentro un muy buen servicio 
Felucidades all day the staff"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Starbuck's location in Las Vegas.  It's right by my Mom's home, it's tucked away.  I tried the Butterscotch Latte hot and it's very good."}
{"text":"The young man working today was extremely rude and pretended like he did not see me come in, and the other worker yelled that she was going on break. I come here for my work and spend about 100$ per week. Will definitely not be returning. Owner you should really come see what your workers are doing it is really frustrating and horrible costumer service."}
{"text":"This starbucks has been around for a long time I would say since 1996 or so. If you are craving starbucks come in to the chapters on Hwy 7, it's usually pretty busy which means people know its there even though it seems so hidden.

I'm a sucker for red velvet cupcakes and I went in hoping to find one, instead they had something called the red velvet whoopie pie from their petite treats selection. It was amazing. only $1.80."}
{"text":"Ahh, Starbucks, how far you have fallen.  I rarely come to this local Starbucks. But we wanted to switch things up from our favorite coffee shop so thought we would visit. 

Not sure I will return.  Staff is disengaged. I spilled my drink when I discovered they did not put the lid on tightly. Ugh.  

The coffee was mediocre.  Had a pumpkin spice mocha to see what all the fuss is about.  Was pretty bland.  Unsure if that is how it is supposed to be or it was because of the barista. 

My coffee mate had the salted caramel mocha. Also mediocre.  

Pass. Next time, we will keep driving up the way towards the Moka for a black-and-white.  Sorry."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong at Starbucks, over priced coffee but it's so good lol. Don't forget a snack like a bagel or pastry they are always fresh."}
{"text":"Closest Starbucks to the CN Tower and the Rogers Centre, this location on Front Street (by the intersection with University) offers outdoor seating during summer months. Inside, there is a sizeable dining area that comes in handy during the winter. Free Wi-Fi and friendly baristas add points to this location. Same typical fare as other Starbucks, this location offers Canadian specialities such as butter tarts, caramel pretzel sticks, and Nanaimo Bars at special times throughout the year."}
{"text":"I visited this Starbucks prior to entering the Hockey Hall of Fame while in Toronto, Canada.

This Starbucks is located in an indoor shopping center that is actually located below ground and only a few feet away from underground subway system. I was surprised to discover when visiting Toronto that there are a great deal of business that operate below ground because of the frigid winter temperatures.

I found this Starbucks to be no different than the rest, there were no specialty drinks sweetened with maple syrup (Canadian joke). What I could order in the States I could order here. The staff working was top notch, efficient, friendly & fast with service. I ordered a decaffeinated cappuccino with steamed soy extra wet and was provided in a very timely manner exactly what I had ordered.

After receiving my drink I was given the option of two separate condiment sections both of which were quite large and clean which is even more important!!! After adding a tad bit of cinnamon to my drink I had the option of sitting inside the Starbucks which has an open feel to the naturally lighted concourse area or sitting outside. I decided to sit and do some people watching which was quite hard everyone still seemed to be dressed like Eskimos.

I did however enjoy while sitting in the open concourse section and looking up toward the ceiling which was a work of art. The glass structure that houses this indoor mall spared no expense when it came to creating business with beauty.

The floor in which my chair was sitting on was made out of lightly smoked glass cubes which I thought looked nice. It was not until later in the afternoon after visiting and exiting the Hall of Fame one floor below this Starbucks did I realize that the glass floor I was sitting on was the ceiling for the floor below. So when visiting this Starbucks and/or walking to / from the folk's one floor below can see basically your image passing by, it was quite neat.

Just like other Starbucks this one offered 'free' WiFi. If you are planning on visiting this location plan on arriving either by subway, bicycle or taxi because there is no parking around. 

I doubt I will ever be in this area again but I am glad I got to experience it!!!"}
{"text":"I checked in to this location at the mirage and had Alicia as my barista. She was polite, upbeat, conversational. I love her (maybe because we have the same name?!) my latte was perfect. A-plus for you, girl!"}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times since they moved from across the street and its the best Starbucks ive been too. Huge seating, drive through and customer service is the best ever!!!"}
{"text":"The drive thru line always seems to take forever and Id say they screw up my (simple) drink about 1/4 of the time. If you HAVE to go here, I recommend going inside."}
{"text":"Coffee was made perfect and the staff was fast and efficient. We went through the drive thru and was given 3 of our 4 drinks and when handed the 4th drink, a tall caramel macchiato it was leaking down the side of the cup, the gentlemen immediately apologized and said he would clean it off for me. Once he handed it back it was still leaking out of the top. I pulled around and went inside and asked for another cup which the girl replied that she can get me another lid, but it wouldn't matter since all of the tall cups are defective. Why would a corporation as large as Starbucks continue to give customers defective cups?? Doesn't seem to make since.

The best part was having coffee stained on my shirt, shorts and car. Thanks starbucks!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service they are rude and heedless, also thy don't accept the green or gold Starbucks card neither their benefits because it's a \"owned casino franchise\" they should align to Starbucks mainstream and keep and accept features like any other one, I would seek for another option around the strip"}
{"text":"Not sure what to say about this Starbucks. It's located inside a Chapters and the staff are very friendly.  They seem to know everyone's name which is also a plus.  

I only stayed here for a short bit, but it seems like your standard Starbucks. Nothing eye-popping but nothing to be ashamed of either."}
{"text":"I like the staff here. When I stepped in, it was not v. Busy and they immediately establish a rapport chatting to you like an old friend before you even order. 

The food and drinks here is pretty standard Starbucks fair.

I like that they listen to our needs, was a cold winter day and when asked, they turned the heat up.  V..understanding."}
{"text":"I'm surprised myself that I'm giving them 3 stars, but maybe they need a little hope. I haven't had any problems with my orders being messed up or with staff being rude. The issue with this location is the amount of time you spend in the drive thru. Maybe if they made people with complicated orders/extra substitutions go inside! Lol 

And I still prefer this location over the one on baseline & 24th st. S.m.h.

I'm writing this review as I'm in line and so far I've been waiting for 15 minutes with 2 more cars still ahead of me, waiting to pay and get our orders. 

Now I'm wondering if they're short staffed and if they are, why? Great location for teens to work.... work environment an issue? Idk."}
{"text":"I was excited that this Starbucks was conveniently located inside Tropicana, which was the hotel I was staying at.
As soon as I come down, there are 2 people ahead of me in line. 

Wow!  Worst service ever!  1 working as the cashier and the other is the barista. 

This didn't happen to me, but the person in front of me ordered a drink and asked for whip and cinnamon on top. The barista said, \"it doesn't come with cinnamon or whip, that's not how you drink it\".  The customer understands that it didn't, but that's just how she wanted it and she was okay paying extra for it.  The Barista then slaps the cinnamon on the counter and tells the customer to do it herself. I was speechless and the fact that customer was so chill and polite the whole time was more surprising.  I would've flipped out. 
 
I understand any job can be stressful, but leave it at home, don't bring it to work.  She took forever to make 1 drink.

Brighter note:  My drink (Caramel Macchiado) was perfect!"}
{"text":"I was here early in the morning when I came here and I was next in line hoping to get my order in ASAP. There were two cashiers that already finished their transaction with the other customers but they just continued to talk talk talk to them. Very slow service here....."}
{"text":"Large very open space, however has slowly decreased in terms of cleanliness relative to the restrooms and either flies flying around harassing you as you are having a conversation or dead flies on the window bases."}
{"text":"I go to Starbucks almost every day, sometimes twice or more! I've been to this one many times. What I love is the consistency and the (apparent) cleanliness. This store has several Japanese baristas, and they provide good service: very polite, and tidy (I find). I go for the double bacon and cheddar for breakfast before work almost every time! Love it! The green tea is also quality stuff!  

Three stars for the things I like. The rest... not so much. The coffee (all locations) is \"off\" tasting (tastes like cleaner or chemicals mixed in. Am I the only one!?) Lacks that 'nuttiness'; that body you'd expect in a good cup of coffee. The strength is good. I'd take a cup of Starbucks over Tim's ANY DAY! 

If you want one of those fancy, hand-crafted, specialty coffees, they charge an arm and a leg, and fill you up with sugar and calories. I get a headache just thinking about it. Sometimes I get a PSL or a white chocolate latte... sometimes I wish I hadn't afterward.

The pastries are all just alright at best. Often overpriced, and a little blah with sugar. I sometimes get the coffee cake. Sigh..."}
{"text":"This place is about $2 more just because it's in Aria. I was about to get a praline latte and I usually get a venti which is $5.25 anywhere else. Here it's $7.25!! So I stopped myself short. If it hadn't been for the hub and his Invisalign removal already, I would've gone to a different coffee place. But alas he insisted on his latte. I ordered a grande and it came out to $6. They also charge $.50 for tax!!!
No other Starbucks does that. It's just one price. Ugh
Las Vegas loves to charge exorbitant amounts of money don't they?!"}
{"text":"My go to location when visiting family on the west island. I'm all about an Iced Vanilla Latte or Passion Iced Tea Lemonade.
They've got free wifi, a drive through and friendly bilingual service. You can sit outside but it can be kind of noisy with all the traffic on the blvd. 
It was a really scorcher outside so I grabbed a Grande Passion Tea Lemonade but I have a feeling I'll be back tomorrow for one of two of my favourite drinks."}
{"text":"This place used to be clean. Now it's dirty and gross.  I will never come to this location again"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried it yet then you must try it for it is Timmy's to go drink now. The new Horchata Frappuccino which is the new rave. Especially here in Vegas it has been so hot and the humidity was just insane. In order to get that extra boost while moving Timmy we had stopped by this Starbucks. For me I love the Mocha Frap's and I love to have them drizzle that chocolate on the inside of the cup and mix it really well.
This Starbucks was very clean and the bathroom was very clean which I was so happy about because we still didn't buy toilet paper yet for Timmy's dorm LOL. The service was very quick and the order was on point. I loved the service that was provided to us and I wish I could have remembered her name for she was just smiling and happy and gave the best customer service. 
This is place was up the block from Storage West in Vegas and I know that the next time we are  in Vegas and we move Timmy's stuff to storage we will be coming back here forsure. You can always count on Starbucks for quality drinks, good food and great dessert items. They also have A/C here and in Vegas that is a HUGE PLUS. 
Also, if you add their app you will receive free drinks and earn points for discounts. Also if you belong to Groupon, then they have deals of buy 5.00 and get 10.00 dollars worth of Starbucks. :}"}
{"text":"This is ALWAYS the slowest Starbucks I've ever gone to!! The problem is it's the closest one to me!"}
{"text":"Great baristas at this location, very large dining area with a beautiful Harbourfront view outside. Iced Mango Black Tea Lemonade is perfect for a warm day!"}
{"text":"It's a Starbucks, it's a small one but if you're lucky the chairs won't be taken as they have 3 nice little couches and about 8 comfy chairs. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I lived in southern highland. So, on my weekend off my family and I always stop by and grub some drinks. I loved the place. Clean and staff seem very friendly but the service can takes an hour. Is a long wait. I loved Starbucks and been every places so, far this place is not fast enough."}
{"text":"I don't like this Starbucks location at all. The parking is horrendous. There are only maybe 10 spots? The rest are further away in the Trader Joe's parking lot. I usually don't complain about walking, but you try parking far in the summer time with a 7 month old! The drive through is forever long. The customers that visit this location are just as bad. You have your snooty white girls who wear makeup with gym clothes to your grumpy old people who feel entitled to the douche bags who don't bother to see you behind them and don't hold the door open. Ugh just bad all around. Only saving grace for this location are the friendly cashiers I've encountered who have always been nice and had smiles on their faces. Kudos to you folks for dealing with this bs everyday! I applaud you."}
{"text":"I love Starbucks absolutely everywhere. This particular location is inside Chapters, and it is usually very busy. I went in two days ago to get the new Horchata drink and I loved it. The only reason I would give this a 4 stars is because two of my friends ordered water as well and one of them had a little black bug in there which was pretty gross."}
{"text":"I am definitely surprised that the rating is so low for this location as it has the friendliest staff I have ever met. It is a slightly smaller location than I'm used to but has a very comfortable feel.

I usually come here for my coffee fix but the frappes are made to perfection and the sandwiches are also delicious. There is free WiFi and I did get refills on my drink (starbucks members only). If you are someone who likes to study with some noise, the music is a little louder than most starbucks so I wouldn't recommend it to study but overall I would definitely recommend this location!"}
{"text":"Yes, this is how you do it. This place restores my faith in humanity. Not only do you get a nice, hot beverage, you get it with a shot of extra strength customer service and a healthy sprinkle of efficiency. Starbucks may be a corporate overlord, but this particular branch looks after the people. 

Catering to the morning rush, this particular Starbucks in the York Concourse should definitely be considered the gold standard. Mobile orders are prepared by a dedicated team so there is no bottleneck. Even when buying in-store, there is a designated order-taking person in the queue so that by the time you're at the counter, they've got your order and all you have to do is pay. 

Most importantly, they're designated as a Starbucks Express which means, NO FRAPPUCCINOS. No 20 item customization, extra sugar, extra cream abomination. No unicorns or crystal balls. They serve everything else on the menu so it's not a big loss in my opinion. If anything, it allows things to move very smoothly which is exactly what commuters want. Get in, get out. If that bothers you, there are many other Starbucks just outside on Front St. 

Plus, the people are so nice. Yeah, most people at Starbucks are pretty nice, but these guys are extra nice. Every one of them says good morning and asks you how your day is going. I've had nice chats and gotten recommendations from them (very berry hibiscus made with coconut milk instead of water, thanks Rhys). 

Once, I was an idiot and tried to pour milk while the top clearly wasn't screwed in and it fell straight into my drink. The girl refilling lids there immediately said she'll get me another one, and she did. This place has to be the \"how to run a Starbucks\" poster child. I hope the manager there is being awarded every \"employee of the month\" award.

{"text":"What a change of pace ! I worked as a shift leader with Starbucks through college so I'm very picky about my Starbucks. The Starbucks back home in Jamestown ny is so dirty I won't even go there. THIS Starbucks is very clean, fast , friendly , and accurate. Consistency consistency consistency! Every time I come to Pittsburgh this is my main coffee spot.  
I'll be back next trip....maybe even tomorrow too!"}
{"text":"This is a smaller Starbucks connected to the Westin Convention Center in Pittsburgh. I've been there twice now. Both times there was a short wait at around 7:00 AM but not too bad. The baristas are friendly and work quickly. Being a black coffee guy I can't comment on their lattes or cappuccinos or any of the other more exotic drinks.

I will say one thing about the Starbucks owned stores - you can be in Pittsburgh, Chicago, San Francisco, or any other city and the coffee is very consistent."}
{"text":"Busy during rush hour. Mostly with parents from nearby schools. 

Nice sitting in front window in you are into watching the world go buy!"}
{"text":"Note that I come to this branch around 8:30pm to 10pm every night for the past week. Lots of seating and I feel safe working alone here?

The only problem is the drinks; I got a very diluted chai tea latte yesterday that I decided to order just Earl Grey tea tonight instead. 

Door says they close at 10pm but they don't kick people out before then"}
{"text":"Needing a place for a downtown meeting, Starbucks at the Westin was most convenient for the group. When I arrived I was surprised how spacious it was for a Starbucks inside of a hotel / office building. There are several tables, a bar seating area, and a space with four comfy chairs. 

The staff couldn't have been nicer! The two ladies behind the bar were friendly and efficient, however, the register was having issues so the manager had to step in to see what was going on. They apologized about the wait and worked with each customer to deal with their tech issue. 

I rarely think of this location since there are so many coffee shops in the area, but I will be making a note that this one is a great location for meetings in the future."}
{"text":"I am so happy with the new location! The old location had air vents that blew down freezing air in the middle of winter, small tables and few plugs. The new location definitely has more seating (not sure why another reviewer thinks it's smaller) and there are plenty of outlets everywhere. People do tend to stay and sit for a long time here doing work. Although I have seen some people waiting around for a seat, I have not had trouble finding a table to sit at. Even if all the smaller tables are full, there's always a seat at the large community table.
The parking lot is a little small, although understandable with the location. I have only once not found parking in the lot, so I just parked down the side street. Not really that far of a walk even in the winter.
The best part though, since the barista area is separate from the seating area, it is not set to freezing! Although you can't really sit around in a tshirt still, at least you don't need 2 layers of sweaters and a jacket.
They can get pretty busy at peak times though, and maybe not enough baristas during those times. I have stood around for a few minutes while they're flying around making orders before someone notices me to take my order. Have not tried the drive through yet, but it does seem to move pretty quickly."}
{"text":"Wow incompetence takes on a new level here. It's not the line that bothers me it's the fact how slow and retatted the staff is. It's Starbucks coffee without the Starbucks service.   After waiting like 30 min for a coffee watching these people barley move I decided to write this. Instead of walking to the line taking orders like most start bucks do, they sit here talking to each other running around accomplishing nothing. Managment needs to reevaluate this store. Terrible"}
{"text":"This place is always crazy busy! They avoid eye contact with you, so even if you stand in front of the pick-up counter waiting for your call ahead order, you can easily be there for 10 minutes because they don't ever look up at the counter. I've left a tip quite a few times, but they don't even say thank you, which to me is kind of rude. They are so busy they never smile, and even though the girl who is working furiously at making drinks says thank you for you order, she never looks up at you while doing so. So impersonal and under staffed at this location."}
{"text":"New Starbucks at a  new plaza called Creekside Crossing.  Ample small tables, a short window bar and a few big study tables.  Good for chilling and doing work.  

Best part? Right next to GO."}
{"text":"First, the staff are really friendly at this location. However, I encounter a few that are a little shy and usually this is when they're new and you know they're new because it would say on their name tags or one of the other baristas would let you know that they are trainees. 

Second, when I come to this location and they are out of a certain food item that I like I get a little sad but having worked at retail and customer service before, I understand that stores do not have infinite supplies of all of their items. You're dumb AF if you think that and you should probably work at customer service so you'll know.

Third, I come to this location often so some of the staff know me by name and drink already, which is awesome! Most of the time, I order my drink and food and get them in a timely manner. Rarely, I have to wait a little bit longer just because this seems to be a convenient location for most people so they get pretty busy so that's understandable."}
{"text":"Although I'd love to tell you I'm getting my daily caffeine fix from a locally owned gem, I'll admit that I'm a bit of a corporate sellout when it comes to my coffee. I love, love their iced coffee and I drink it all year round. The baristas at this location are killer! That being said- whoever engineered the entrance to their parking lot apparently knows nothing about Starbucks drive thru lines. The line here is almost always out to the street and the parking lot entrance is blocked by the cars in the line! So even if you are up to the (apparently huge) task of walking in to buy a coffee there's nowhere to park."}
{"text":"Nice location, great coffee, there's a drive-thru for people in a hurry or antisocial. 
Only negative I see is that their terrasse in the sun is LITTERED WITH GARBAGE. The kind of garbage that has been there since the snow has melted 3 MONTHS ago...Nice! Way to go! I wrote this on June 27, 2018. Let's see how long it'll take for them to clean it.
From this terrasse you can look out at the people on Second Cup accross the blvd and laugh at those losers...jk, well not completely."}
{"text":"Wow, how tacky can a place be?  We ordered our coffee and and then asked for some water and they want to charge $1.08 for it,  I was like what we get free water every single time at every single Starbucks that I have been tacky Starbucks you need to take better care of your customers"}
{"text":"How can you pass up Happy Hour at Starbucks with 1/2 priced frappuccinos?

I figured this was an excellent time to try out more Starbucks Secret menu items. Was meeting up with some friends so I thought I'd surprise them with the following frappuccinos: Nutella, Peaches and Cream, Samoa Cookie, Raspberry Cheesecake and Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

The staff here have got the system down pat, cranking out the orders at lightening speeds all the while with smiles and great attitudes while servicing a packed house (Friday 4:30pm). 

I passed out spoons to my friends and we had a taste testing. No one liked the Peaches & cream and one person liked the Raspberry Cheesecake (I didn't like the artificial taste of the raspberry). We all liked the Nutella, Samoa Cookie, and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. They were definitely on the sweet side though, good thing we shared.

TIPS FOR ORDERING SECRET MENU ITEMS:
- Look online or download an app because there's new ones coming out all the time.
- Don't order the drink by name, either tell them the ingredient list or show them a picture of the \"recipe\". They're not official menu items so the baristas might not know what you're talking about.
- Feel free to make up or customize your own drink. Just as long as they have the ingredients and you're willing to pay extra for the add ins, you're good to go!
- It's better to go during non-peak hours especially if your order is complex. You don't want to anger the baristas or customers behind you for taking up extra time in explaining your drink."}
{"text":"The Starbucks is a really nice reserve Starbucks but the line is always out the door because it's located inside of them all. I wish it was larger but I feel like this location is always jampacked because of where it's located in the mall specifically. I would definitely be back and all the employees are very nice here."}
{"text":"I visited this Starbucks today because it was just really convenient location-wise. I did actually walk inside because I wanted to see their food options, and I ended up ordering two drinks, one of which ended up being relatively complicated (a few add-ons, nonfat milk, no whip, etc.). The service was amazing! Every barista with whom I interacted (I think 3/4 or 4/5 of the employees I saw there?) was personable and knowledgeable about the drinks.

They've stepped up their game immeasurably and I would not hesitate to come back. A+, Starbucks. I salute you."}
{"text":"The service at this location is poor.  Oders are consistently wrong and the employees are rude when you ask for corrections.  I take the extra time to drive to the location at Baseline and Elsworth."}
{"text":"if I could give zero stars, I would..... this is the SLOWEST starbucks I have ever been to.... only 2 cars in front of me in the drive through and still waited at least 15 min just to order!!!!!!! they offer absolutely no compensation for the wait time.... do not go here!!!!!!"}
{"text":"1st visit..First I almost slipped and fell walking in the door on a rain day with no mats down for anyone. The entire store was in filth. Baristas sitting on the floor doing the display case in her apron while her friend that was visiting the store was behind the counter doing a song and dance. The display case was in shambles with nothing to choose from except maybe two things and crumbs. Last visit... used a Starbucks free drink reward and bought a sandwich... took almost 15 minutes to get the sandwich and they made my drink wrong. Not going back."}
{"text":"This Starbucks just opened yesterday replacing the one a block away with the fireplace and the one on the corner of Queen and Hammersmith.
Now the one with the fireplace a block away had comfy couches and soft chairs.  But it was so crowded and closed in that you couldn't find room to change your mind.
But this location is still in the throws of opening.  It has a huge patio that hasn't opened yet and they are expecting more chairs.  But it is so spacious and bright.
All the staff from next door is still here.  They are fantastic.  A special shout out to the two supervisors that make the place what it is imho, Rebecca and Matt!"}
{"text":"I go to a lot of Starbucks, I like the consistency.  Yesterday was my first time in this store as I get to know Toronto.  I'm back again today to see if was a one off experience yesterday. It wasn't!
The staff at this location go the extra mile to engage every customer.  Major kudos to the man who is the trainer at this store. I watched him have genuine contact with every client that came in this morning. The other thing was how many of them he called by name and then confirmed their regular drinks without them having to ask.  This guy is it!
Yesterday the outstanding barista that brought me back was Misha!"}
{"text":"Fantastic staff and a wonderful new store.  The only thing missing is their internet router.  For that reason and that reason only I rate it a 4."}
{"text":"So I ran through the drive-thru here just before closing tonight because I wanted to try the new triple mocha Frappuccino but as I drove away and took a sip I realized it was caramel. I circled back through the drive-through immediately, but they already had turned out the lights to close the store, wouldn't speak to me over the speaker, wouldn't even answer me even though they clearly saw me when I pulled up to the window. I held up the Frappuccino so that they would see I was the one they had just helped moments before, but they continued to ignore me. 

Went in 2 days later and discussed this issue with the manager who was very professional & apologetic, especially that I had to come back to the store to have this dealt with. She made me the drink I had ordered and said she would discuss this issue with her staff.

The drink was great and I appreciated the way this was handled."}
{"text":"My biggest complaint is they really aren't all that friendly & that the place is usually packed. 

The coffee is just as good as any other Starbucks."}
{"text":"Zero wow factor.  Service is okay on a good day. Staff do they buy you can see a lack in leadership   coffee is good"}
{"text":"I come to this Starbucks every day, thru the drive thru. And everyday they can never hear me, so I'm always repeating at least twice. I order the same drink every day, 8 times out 10, it tastes different. Same drink just something is always off day after day. So frustrating. The other HUGE deal, the drive thru is a ridiculous wait! Whether it be 3 cars or 10, give yourself at least 10 min to get thru the line, at least! 
Up here in southern Highlands there isn't a lot to choose from, with anything but I can guarantee if there was a coffee bean next store, I'd be there!"}
{"text":"This Starbucks is disappointing.   Been there at least 25 times.  Closest to my house.  But doubt I'll be back.  About 1/3 drinks is wrong.  Yesterday they failed to put soy in a soy-vanilla-latte.  Today my flat white lid was cracked on Three places. So I wore it.  Empathy is poor also.  No sorry when I have to go back and have a drink remade.  Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I ordered a green tea frappicino well shaken and a green tea latte. When they give me the green tea frap, I said its not well shaken. The girl says it is and I tell her its not because I can see chunks of the green tea powder stuck at the bottom.  Look at it yourself like seriously. So she takes it back and gives it a good shake and now all the clumps are gone. My friend and I taste the two green tea beverages and they literally taste like flavour water. 

The amount of water they mixed in with the latte is ridiculous. And ice was filled up to 3/4 of the cup itself. I'm not even exaggerating. 

First off don't tell me its well shaken when it's not. Or do you not understand the meaning of \"well shaken\" then I'd question their level of intelligence. Secondly, this starbucks mixes far too much water and ice with their drinks making it unflavourable and bland. 

Another place I would not be returning to."}
{"text":"This is a new Starbucks near the Federal building on Grant Street.   It has many of the amenities of other Starbucks and it is efficiently run.  The positives include a very friendly staff that recognize repeat customers.  The line move smoothly.  The store could have more premium seating, though the chairs they do have are quite plush.  They have wireless and convenient bench seating but it is a little cramped in peak hours."}
{"text":"This Starbucks was ok. Since it's the only Starbucks around southern highland area so the drive thru in the morning or sometimes noon time was unbelievably long. I'll suggest you just go straight in the store. There's been a lot of times I skip my coffee cause of the outlook of the line lol."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Starbucks in Pittsburgh! 

Does it get busy? Yes. Is there usually a line? Yes. Do you get the typical friendly starbucks service you get in the burbs? No. You are downtown not the burbs so don't expect a quite Starbucks where the baristas chat with you. This place is all about the atmosphere!

You can sit in the Starbucks area with your coffee which is bright and lovely or you can go into the lobby of the hotel (what I prefer) and sit in a grand room and enjoy your beverage. This is a great place to meet up with people and get your caffeine jolt."}
{"text":"As mentioned by others, this location is quite 'cozy' with three or four small tables. I had time to kill so decided to grab a tea and surf the Net on my phone. In spite of its small size, this Starbucks has a lot of people coming in to grab their java. The service was excellent - all staff were quite friendly and made you feel welcome. 

Good for: coffee, tea, WiFi"}
{"text":"I recently moved to the neighbourhood so this is the closest Starbucks from my place. Right at the corner of Yonge and Davisville, it's conveniently located. A perfect place as a meeting spot because you can't miss it - it's right there. On the smaller side, but there are enough tables and chairs. Staff are pretty friendly and ensure that you're satisfied with your drink. I'm not sure what else to say in a review for Starbucks. Anyway, for me, it's convenient so I'll be frequenting this place often.

Good for: coffee, tea, snacks"}
{"text":"This place is packed, like all the time ! I used to take a weekend course at U of T   for two semesters so this location was my usual hang out on Saturday and Sunday's if I could find an empty seat. I returned last night to meet up with my pal and (again) it was packed. Luckily I found two people leaving so I ran over to them and snagged the table. Anyway, it's a Starbucks so my review isn't going to be too long. I find the service to be excellent each time; the baristas are super friendly and efficient. In spite of the high turnover of patrons, I find this location to always be clean (washroom included). The location is super convenient if you're meeting up with someone. I came right from work so I parked in the Green P next door and my pal took the subway (station is right across the street).

Good for: coffee, meet ups, dates"}
{"text":"Watch how they ring you up - they rang me up for a black tea lemonade when I ordered just black tea. The clerk claimed it was because I asked for a splash of flavoring (not even a pump of syrup). 2 drinks + small food items was $20. Bad service and rude employee.

The employee who made my drink did add the flavoring for me which was nice. 

Aria - these employees need to be trained up to meet your service levels that I have learned to expect."}
{"text":"Resident Starbucks fanatic back at it again folks. Thank you, thank you. No need to applaud. Ok, applaud LOL it makes me feel good! Isn't it nice to have a little humor in a review? Makes it a bit more interesting!

Ok.....so I want to give this place a 2 star rating. But, the inside is just too beautiful for me to do that. What in Sam hill possessed the engineers of Starbucks to pick a location with like 5 parking spots? Seriously.....it turns into a war zone! Not to mention, the flow of the parking lot is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! If you are going through drive through.....beware. You could end up waiting on the street in the middle of traffic. No joke people. Real life frogger.

The inside of this location is absolutely beautiful. I love the fit and finishes they used, the large selection of food and snacks and I LOVE how bright and full of light it is here. Baristas are knowledgable....but expediency is very much lacking. I could have put a load of laundry in and come back.....ok, not that bad. But it took almost 10 minutes, and it wasn't near as busy as some of the other locations....and those locations rock the time!

I opt out from this location as much as possible only because spots are scarce and I really don't want to wait the extra time for my drink."}
{"text":"I really like this location. The baristas are friendly and make an effort to remember your drink. The seating upstairs is really comfortable and is separated from the action at the cash register downstairs. The washrooms were also really clean which I found to be a treat for a Danforth location. I'm glad this has opened in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"There is always Nast, but it was right outside the doors. As I enter Starbucks I always choke on second hand smoke. It's really quite annoying. The service is fine. Wait in line quite a.bit. but most of the staff  are friendly"}
{"text":"Where everybody knows your name..... I love the cheery sweet drive thru chick that's a mix between Sophie Turner and Julia Styles. She's full of espresso and mid western charm wrapped up in emerald Starbucks pizzazz throwing jazz hands and coffee. Thank you for the great service and cheery morning smile!!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to this Starbucks the baristas are so friendly and produce the coffee variations in a timely manner!!!!"}
{"text":"Worst Starbucks in the city. Can not make a latte right in a year of living next door. Even when I tell them exactly how I like it they then put it in the wrong size cup and ruin it. Chai latte always tastes like water and milk, even when ask for more concentrate. The lattes are always either like warm or so hot they burn your mouth. Drive the extra 2 minutes and go to another location because every staff member at this location needs to be retrained."}
{"text":"Mobile ordered my drink here and picked it up. First time coming to this location and this mall but it was actually really nice! My drinks were being held by an employee who greeted me when I walked up to the counter and she gave me my drinks. 
Area itself was clean and well lit. Good experience."}
{"text":"I visit this Starbucks every morning before heading to work. On most mornings I am greeted by Makialay (I'm probably spelling her name incorrectly). She is friendly and exemplifies the meaning of great customer service. 

-Army Customer"}
{"text":"On 1/18/2015at 2:30 pm on a Sunday My Girlfriend and I visited the Starbucks in Our neighborhood on college and horizon. I haven't been inside of this new location I usually use the drive thru. On this day we decided to sit inside and chat. We both could not believe how disgusting this location was.  Besides us there was maybe 3 people inside the location. We looked for a seat. Every table was dirty and so was the floor beneath it. Then there is 4 leather like chairs that literally looked like people dumped there coffee on them and just left it. They were Gross.... Every trash can was over flowing to the floor. The trash by the front door especially. Somebody had dropped half of a bagel with cream cheese that was stuck to the floor. Along with empty coffee cups and just trash every where. I have never seen a Starbucks look this bad. When they were across the street in the Albertsons shopping center there was never this problem. Gross just Gross...."}
{"text":"Not happy at all but I'm giving them 2 stars for the friendly dude in the drive thru. My drink was great (although I could have done without the caramel running down the side of the cup and making my hand a sticky mess) but my breakfast sandwich - an entirely different story. Not only was it so haphazardly put together that I had to totally reassemble it but it was burned. Not burned so bad that I wasn't able to eat it but burned enough that I had to tear off most of the bottom of the bun. Whoever packaged this should have easily seen that it was just too burned to be served! I'm embarrassed for them and annoyed for me! 

I get it...it's 7:30 on a Friday morning and you're busy. But don't go burning my sandwich over it! Get a clue! 

Pics included, by the way!"}
{"text":"Nice new location....used to be Mr. D's Custard place. Plenty of indoor and outdoor covered seating options. Friendly baristas."}
{"text":"I have to agree with a lot of what Gregg said in his review. 

This new location has way more space, both indoor and on the outdoor patio. The parking in front allows for about six cars, but there's literally an ocean of spaces all around this place. No time to hang, hit up the drive-thru and get that caffeine fix. 

The WiFi is a little weak sometimes, but that's an SBUX norm."}
{"text":"I was so happy they opened this location because it is close to my work and home. However.... It is dirty. Trash cans are always overflowing and the floors look like they aren't cleaned. If you sit in the lounge chairs, you can see the dust piled at the bottom of the windows. Too bad."}
{"text":"Manager made my coconut milk drink in the dairy pitcher. I am allergic to dairy and requested a remake. Manager states: in 2 months we're getting rid of the pitchers and you'll just have to take what you get. All Starbucks are no longer going to me making special cases for allergens. After I finish out what's on my Starbucks card, I will delete the app and go local."}
{"text":"They are fast but definitely not clean! I'm satisfied with my drinks always they just really need to clean as they go a fly on the counter is not good at all!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for breakfast today. Fast service, despite being busy. We ordered two breakfast sandwiches which were very good. 

The coffee was very good too, if you're a Starbucks lover. 

The only minor downside was we went here the end of October and the seating area was kind of cold, so we took our stuff to the hotel lobby. 

Very pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Pros: lots of room, good place to study, friendly staff

Cons: not very clean, slow service

It's close to my house so I go periodically when I'm not in a hurry"}
{"text":"Parking here can be a hastle and the drive through is weird to get to. The people are nice here....Drinks are tasty...it is a starbucks...."}
{"text":"Showed up with literally 8+ cars infront of me, leaving with my things in 10 mins. Enough said."}
{"text":"I went thru the drive thru, naturally it wasn't a quick stop but \"hey, I didn't expect any different\". 

The man who took my order was very kind and friendly, made conversation while I waited at the window. 

I got home and found that I got the wrong drink, actually I got \"jims\" drink hahaa! 

I called and they remembered me right away and began to apologize because they noticed as I drove away. Offered for me to come back that night or the next morning for a complementary drink. 

Another good side as they were open late so I was able to go back that night, mistake or not.. Who doesn't want two yummy drinks in one night?!"}
{"text":"Decent location in Tuscany.  Typical Starbucks, drive thru is quick here.  Latte as ordered."}
{"text":"Good location for me on the way to work.  It's Starbucks, consistent quality and quick service at this location."}
{"text":"My favorite starbucks in this area. Fast, good quality food and drinks, usually plenty of seating! The bathrooms are clean and the tables are usually clean as well. As with most Starbucks locations, the trash/creamer/straw/napkin area wasn't the cleanest but considering how many people use it within 5 minutes I don't blame the store."}
{"text":"No. No. No.

If the lines aren't enough to stop you from coming here, I can give you a few other reasons.

Once your order is placed, they take SO LONG. Waiting twelve minutes for a medium drink that I know can be made in two is just ridiculous.

The staff always comes off rude, sometimes when it isn't busy (Say- 6 p.m. on a Monday) they ignore someone waiting in line for minutes at a time, notice them, and say \"I'll be with you in a sec\" and ignore them for another couple minutes. They also aren't conversational at all and don't know how to answer questions or just be generally nice.

Anyway, don't come here. It's just not worth it. Walk to the other starbucks across the street (4780 S Maryland Pkwy) and get way better service and better quality drinks. They will be happy to serve you."}
{"text":"Ce Starbucks a malheureusement fermé ses portes il y a peu. C'était celui le plus proche de chez moi :("}
{"text":"Ok. They've been in this location for long enough, even with staff turnover and flexibility changes to be better than this. I've been during peak hours and they seem to get it right. It's the off peak that I feel needs some attention. And that's the point. Pay attention. Get off the chatsnip twitter book and pay attention to execution. If there are patrons in the business they are your only priority. Otherwise I'm soooo glad it's closer to me. Even on a blustery winter day I can justify a walk to the neighborhood Bucks. Get the service component down and this place has real staying power. They do brew, my brew, oh so well."}
{"text":"I have a Starbucks card with over 100 on it. I found out a few days ago that my card is deactivated. Contacted Starbucks, they said 
\"We have received notification from the financial institution for the payment method that was used in funding the card to remove the funds due to disputed transactions.\"
Which is bogus. I have not ever had a dispute with my bank.
They basically said go away and not to brother them again

So if you are thinking of getting the Starbucks card please think again if it is really worth it. They do not respect your trust on the money that you put in their care.

They are awe full company and awe full customer support.

I have read similar posting on the web, so I am not the only one."}
{"text":"Stupid gas station location, patio right on a busy Main Street.   Lots of people who think they are special park right at the front door and sneak into line.   

They should just blow this location up and put it in the middle of the condo development."}
{"text":"The staff here are very nice, they do ask how your day is going which I have yet to experience at other locations. They get really busy but they work really well as a team and I have yet to wait very long for my food/drink. Only negative is that it is a very small stand so expect to be around a lot of other people. My drink has always come out the way I have asked for it and no grumpy baristas either!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Starbucks in the downtown/Westmount area. 

I've visited here 3-4 times during my most recent visit to Montreal, and each time, the counter people have been friendly and the baristas have always gotten my drink right. And my drink is one that is not on the menu and other Starbucks sometimes don't get it right. So it's really refreshing to encounter one that is consistently good. (Hey, when you're paying over $6 for a coffee, you want it to be right. Am I right?).

Furthermore, this store is large and spacious, in a galley-like configuration, with the entire south-facing wall of windows, making for a light-infused interior. Great for people-watching, too. There are small bistro tables for two along the window walls, but also a long rectangular table running the length of the store, in the middle. There are Deco-esque ceramic embossed ceiling tiles over the seating areas,  and a dramatic, heavy deep green velvet drape over the counter, making the place feel a bit like a theater of yore. It has character to it which my mother and I find very appealing.

There are two bathrooms here (you need a code to get in); both have always been clean when we've visited.

Bonus: every time I've visited, this store has played the best music! (I know this is subjective, but in my opinion, it's true!)."}
{"text":"New staff changes everything about this location. Faster and friendlier service plus the ability to use a lot of the space to study has upped my rating for this particular Starbucks."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't been said before? They are great. I love the passion tea (venti size) with one splenda. No calories or fat and tastes awesome. The very berry hibiscus is fantastic as well but, has a few calories. Well worth it though!"}
{"text":"Really nice Starbucks with plenty of space, tables, and couches. It seems like a great place to work and there were definitely people.

In addition, I had an amazing cup of Joe. I got the dark roast, added some cream, two packets of sugar, and vanilla powder. Voila!

Also great location right near the bus terminal."}
{"text":"Nice location and alot of seats and spacious but without wifi is a big fail in my book. Employees say the wifi has been off and on for 3mths. 
Management replace the router pls."}
{"text":"Honestly...I don't know what my life would be like without Starbucks!

I always get Starbucks wherever I go ...its a great way to start your day or catch a break! 

while staying in the Omni William Penn hotel... i was spoiled with an upscale Starbucks located inside the hotel...been here a few times... just to get my Starbucks fixed!

i absolutely love this Starbucks if your looking for something to cool you off then go for a vanilla bean Frappacino or lemonade[[with or without tea]] or their new peach green tea and if you're looking for something hot then go for a latte and pleaseee go for there yummy dessert bread treats...so freaken good and so are their services...this might be the biggest Starbucks in Pittsburgh and the nicest!"}
{"text":"I read everyone else's review and they're a bunch of idiots. How do you condemn Starbucks for having a beautiful interior and a great product and killer staff but give them low ratings because the Business owner built a crappy parking lot. The place is amazing you guys are idiots."}
{"text":"Always great staff and always smiling. I tried the blonde expresso latte and really loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Every time we come here we have to wait forever. They never have enough baristas and the ones they have are super slow. Disappointing"}
{"text":"I frequent this Starbucks because of it's location. 
The staff here is attentive and friendly, not like other locations where the staff can make you feel like a nuisance. The coffee is tasty... I usually get a Grande Pike."}
{"text":"For my 100th review, it is very appropriate for me to write about Starbucks, I frequent  many Starbucks across the east side of the valley. I get recognized at quite a few Starbucks, which can be viewed as both good and bad. My friend and I like to sit on the patio and soak up the sunshine and occasional exhaust  fumes from the adjacent drive thru. Her kid has plenty of room to play while we enjoy our beverages. The inside is clean and has a modern look. The staff are always friendly. I use my gold card to get an iced coffee, when I refill it on that same visit, it is free. For those that do not frequent Starbucks, if you get a hot brewed coffee, iced coffee or iced tea, your refill will only be 50 cents. The food selections are fresh. The wait time is minimal. I do not have to repeat my order over and over. Most importantly, when I redeem my reward beverage, they do not charge me. This is great because at every other Starbucks that I frequent, I get charged for an add-on to my drink and then it turns into an unpleasant experience for all involved. 
The location is easy to access and the parking is decent. 
The Pike was weak the last time I ordered it, so I just advised the barista and she resolved it with a smile.

Enjoy being part of the norm, even when the so-called coffee connoisseurs frown on fine folks that drink brewed coffee EVERYDAY. We love Starbucks."}
{"text":"Best Starbucks Ive been to so far in Vegas.  There is one closer to UNLV on Maryland Pkwy which is packed usually with students (naturally).  And another farther down Eastern on Desert Inn, but the drive thru configuration is a little awkward and the baristas haven't always been that friendly or helpful. BUT, this Starbucks was perfect. The barista offered different options and actually told me he would make it any way I liked. I don't think I've ever heard that at a Starbucks. I always get that feeling I'm twisting their arms. Lol I still don't like paying $6 for a grande frap, but as an occasional treat it's ok... especially if they are willing to make it just the way I like it. The drive thru was super fast and an added plus is the spacious parking lot to maneuver in. 

One last thing... Thank You to whomever built this Starbucks ...not just for giving me a place to grab a cup of joe close to my job, but also for giving the area a much needed improvement!!!"}
{"text":"The woman who made my order made it incorrectly - I did not want sweetener in my coffee.  And when I tasted the coffee and it had sweetener and I said I did not want my iced coffee that way, the barista's response was \"well, it comes like that.\"  Um excuse me, since when?  Does Starbucks make their iced coffee like McDonald's now?   And even worse, when I told her that I've been getting Starbucks coffee for years and they may ask if you want sweetener, but not just presume, her response was, \"I've worked here for four years and it always has sweetener.\"  It was just terrible customer service all around and a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"This is a small Starbucks! Close to Canadian tire. Beside being small which makes it hard at times to find a place with bad weather the patio is gorgeous specially in summer time! 
You can use the parking lot so no need to worries about parking or getting a ticket.
Most importantly the staff are super nice and super pleasant! 
Overall one of my favorite Starbucks branches!"}
{"text":"The fact that this is the only location in this area is not any of the baristas fault, however, with how many people reside in Southern Highlands you'd think there would be more people employed at this location. I've never gone through the drive thru, yes DRIVE THRU, in less than 15 minutes. Went inside thinking ok maybe it will be faster. Nope. I waited 20 minutes for my coffee that they didn't even make right. I'm very fair and understanding when it comes to situations like this but this is not the first time it has happened. It's inevitable this location is as busy as it is, however I do believe the timing of everything could be improved."}
{"text":"I love this location. Friendly staff and they make my coffee the way I like. Unfortunately it's closing on the April 15th."}
{"text":"This Starbucks is by far the most disorganized that I've been to, especially when going through the drive thru. They regularly make my drink orders incorrectly and are always out stock of bakery and sandwiches. I regrettably keep coming back because of the convenient location."}
{"text":"This is a terrible Starbucks. It seems like every time I'm here they are getting ready to close. Sweeping and mopping around customers at all hours is totally inappropriate. I asked someone if they were about to close as they collided with me ( sitting. Having coffee ) and I got a glazed look and the response was \" people always ask me that when I'm sweeping \" TAKE A HINT. I get sweeping when you're closing but you're not ! Who's running this one ? Also there Is someone fast asleep on the couch here. This place needs new management. Now."}
{"text":"Had the best Starbucks experience today -- so much so, I felt compelled to write my first Yelp review.  

I'm from the Bay Area and unapologetically, a bit of a coffee snob. 

So when the homie picked this location to go over the weekend game plan, I was skeptical -- I've too many NIGHTMARE Starbucks experience. 

But the homie said the cup of joes would be on him -- plus he said I can get a pastry -- I couldn't say no...  

The moment we walked in, it reminded me of the neighborhood shops from home. 

Almost in unison, all of the baristas welcomed my buddy and I with a \"Good morning!\"

Even with the line out of the door and a drive-thru that seemed backed up to Primm -- which is a testament to their product quality and customer service -- our wait didn't seem long at all. 

After ordering, the barista on bar was welcoming and engaging with all of the customers in her vicinity, while STILL conquering the mountains of drinks. 

She put on a show. Everyone was laughing and having a great time -- perfect start to any day. 

My cappuccino was perfect, albeit a little on the wet side. 

I've crossed over to the dark side; I am now a Starbucks believer.

And this store is 100% the reason why."}
{"text":"This Starbucks has become my new stomping grounds, due to its proximity to where I work.

My initial impression approaching it was a heart-sinking frustration, due to the crazy lineups.  However, I am here to tell everyone not to worry about it.

The staff in this busy location are fast, efficient and friendly.  But not too friendly, because they have a long lineup of coffee to serve!  To clarify that statement, they are ALWAYS friendly, just not chatty.  And I like that.  Nothing gets my goat more than being 3 people back in line and watching a baritsa start kabitizing with their customer over where they got their pretty necklace, while I am giving them the very thirsty, hairy eyeball.

That has not happened at this starbucks.  They are movers and shakers, and a long long line up has never resulted in an unreasonable wait.  I have had long waits at less sophisticated competitors.

WIth this type of customer service mindset, I hope that some of those workers get hired in IT.  We can use people like that."}
{"text":"Starbucks is Starbucks is Starbucks.... so I will talk less about Starbucks, and most about this location.

The good....

1.  Right on Memorial Drive, so it is extremely convenient when I am heading out of downtown via Edmonton Trail.
2.  Staff are friendly
3.  Quality is consistent with other Starbucks

1.  The parking lot is shared with Esso and it is an accident waiting to happen.  There are cars coming and going through 2 entrances, and people are jonesing to get out of there once they have their gas and/or coffee.  It is deadlocked due to the traffic to exit this establishment
2.  On the date that I was there (April 20, 2011), there was an issue with the drive though.  The mic and speaker were not working correctly, so the barista was having an impossible time hearing me.  On the flipside, they were tough to hear too.  Quite walky-talky-ish.

So.... 5 stars... 5 comments.  3 were positive, 2 were suggestions.... so... 3 out of 5 for this location for me."}
{"text":"I love this Starbucks. It is close to home so it is very convenient for me. The service is really fast & they usually make my drinks just the way I order them. Lakemead is a very busy and loud street so my only problem is sometimes I have to yell at the intercom in the drive through and I feel bad for the employees haha but either than that, this is a great location."}
{"text":"Not a large location compared to other locations but as a grab and go coffee place, it works for me. There was a rearranging done in the past couple of years and all of the seating is towards the front of the store but not too close to the entrance way. All of the ordering is done towards the back. If there is a lineup of 3 or more, the queue will snake around and impede on those who want to use the bathroom.

As far as the other aspects, I've become a familiar face so it's nice to be greeted in a recognizable fashion. Specialty coffees are also consistent from visit to visit and with other locations."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the smaller locations non-financial district locations out there. Even smaller than their Chapters/Indigo locations. At peak times, you're not likely to find a place to sit so this place is more suited for ordering your coffee and then taking it out with you.  They do have a place for you to tie your dog outside while you order inside if walking your dog with a cup of coffee is your thing.

The summer time is nicer as they do set up a patio with seating but keep in mind that you are right beside a busy six-lane section of Yonge so dust and noise can be a factor but when the weather is nice, the outside section is well-utilized.

I do like this location for the convenience and friendliness of the staff... It's also really the only coffee shop in the area as the Tim Horton's across the street is inside an Esso station."}
{"text":"If you're on Yelp, you know what Starbucks is so I don't need to give a background. If you are an occasional coffee drinker like me, you don't need an education on which coffee chain's coffee is better than others. I leave that opinion up to the individual as each of our tastes, preferences and even how we like our coffee are different (cream, milk, sugar, type of roast, style).

I'm sharing this review based on how this Starbucks is better than the hundreds others I've encountered in my travels.

The ordering counter/barista space (sorry - don't know if there is an official word for this area) is pretty standard compared to other locations. There's ample space to create a queue without needing to be so close to the customer in front or behind you if it's busy. Service is pretty standard for Starbucks in that they are keen and friendly when taking your order and spell your name correctly on occasion. I think spelling names incorrectly is their thing. It's generally harmless and seems to give them free publicity through social media as just about everyone has to share their new name.

The dining/lounging space for customers is rather large and combines different seating elements from many other Starbucks together. This is where it gets good. You have your window seats for people watching, your sofas and padded one-seaters with end tables, tables for smaller or larger groups and a decent sized patio on the sidestreet not too close to the road. So much variety depending on what your mood is, who you're with (or not with) and how long you want to stay.

This isn't the Starbucks I frequent because it is not my closest but the times I have stopped here, I would always wish it was at the end of my street. If you're in the area and need a caffeine fix, this is definitely the place, especially if you're a fan of Starbucks."}
{"text":"Worst Starbucks  in town!! The wait here is ridiculous  but the employees are nice not sure if that makes up for how slow they are.   Drive threw here is always backed up     If you want coffee or tea go up the street the Perk Up Coffee better tasting coffee also"}
{"text":"Busy location!!! Mobile Order at all cost! So from time to time I have to head over to the eastside of town and this location is right off Tropicana & Eastern. When I thought about visiting the other location not too far from here on Flamingo/ Sandhill I was a bit leery since they messed my order up before when I was running late. 

When I pulled up to the stoplight I could see the drive-thru was wrapped almost around the building. Completed my mobile order and was able to run (literally) right in and my coffee and sand-which were already ready! Yessss! Speedy and accurate service will always get a full row of 5 stars from me, not to mention the baristas working inside were so sweet and really working their asses off! Kudos to this Starbucks team!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews but decided to stop anyway.  I actually stopped on three occasions and noticed that they were busy on all three stops.  Despite being overwhelmed, the baristas were very friendly and got me my drink within a few minutes of ordering.  No complaints; except they may be too good and too busy, but they still do just fine."}
{"text":"I rag a lot on big chains like these in general.  That being said, this one is not that bad based on the half a dozen times I've been there.   

Good things: The service is pretty quick, no one has ever been rude to me, and today they slightly messed up my order so they gave me a coupon for a free drink.  Better recovery than I was expecting from a busy chain with a drive through window.

Mediocre things: #1 The universally high prices.  Over $5 for a grande soy white chocolate mocha with no whip?  Seriously?  #2 The sugar free mint syrup.  It's kinda nasty.  

Things that are just bad about this place: Drive through line is always pretty long and unfortunately there are two lanes that feed into it right near where they take your order near the back of the building, so the line is actually much longer than it looks from the street.  

Overall, it's standard for  Starbucks.  Nothing outrageously special, nothing ragingly bad."}
{"text":"I don't Starbucks nearly as much as I used to, but when I do, I hit up this location. The employees have changed over the years but are ALWAYS super friendly! If the line is out the door, no worries, they get you in and out in no time. If there is a problem with your drink, they fix it right away. If they know you and your order never changes, they start making it as soon as you walk in. It hurts to pay the prices there sometimes, but it hurts less when the service is superb!"}
{"text":"Love the coffee but students are hanging out there hours and I never find a spot to sit down ..."}
{"text":"One of the best Starbucks I have frequented with a friendly, knowledgeable staff and quick service.  

I recently had a booth at a free community health fair, and they offered to provide the water and cups, which gave the community water on a hot day and helped me and my company greatly.

LOVE this Starbucks and their people :)"}
{"text":"Just waited in line for 15 mins for a coffee while the two women behind the counter sauntered around as if no one was even in line! Unbelievably slow service and we finally walked out. Get it in gear!  Worst service I have ever experienced and I won't be back.  15 mins of my life I'll never get back."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS LOCATION.
After receiving horrible service at the chandler heights & Gilbert location, I came here hoping they'd be better. Hailey made my drink and she was SO KIND & my drink was delicious & PERFECTLY made. I left this Starbucks feeling so happy & that's all because of Hailey. She deserves a raise & im definitely coming back because of her."}
{"text":"Been sitting in the drive-thru for 20 minutes. There's still 3 cars in front of me and two behind me. There is really no other Starbucks drive-thru in the immediate area so I can understand the business. But 30 minutes from entering to exit line is a bit much. No apologies for the wait, and the drinks weren't ready when we got to the window. Two white mochas."}
{"text":"No name tags one washroom out of service and garbage full .. better luck next time .. friendly staff"}
{"text":"It has become the most dreaded drive thru of all times . They even he a sign out that says they want to serve 60 cars in 30 mins HA .... it takes at least 15 mins a car. They seriously need to put some veterans who wo t k gor starbucks here to speed up the process. Seems like a new person every day. Several employees have mentioned the management at this location is difficult to work for so maybe they need to lighten up because the turnover rate is ridiculous. So until things get better I've decided on Perk up coffee shop just about a mile away still in Southern Highlands much faster service and awesome coffee selection."}
{"text":"This has been my first experience going to a drive-thru only Starbucks location. I frequently drive down Route 65 during my work commute, so this location is very convenient for me since I don't have to go out of my way.

The order screen has a live video view of the cashier/barista taking the order, providing a more personalized, modern-day experience. This morning, there were three cars in front of me, which usually spells disaster at a drive-thru, waiting far too long for orders. However I always seem to zip through within a minute or two, drink in hand, and greeted by a friendly wait staff at the window.

They do a surprisingly good job of making you feel welcome, even in the often impersonal space of a drive-thru window, and the service has always been fast. And yes, they take the Starbucks app! No worries about fumbling with change in the car.

Starbucks locations can be hit or miss. This one has the friendliest customer interactions I've seen, and I've visited several walk-in locations in the area."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the busiest locations which is great for the owner but bad for the customer. There is always a line up (approx 10 min) and they always run out of almond milk...this happens 2-3 times a week, you'd think that management would learn to manage their inventory better to avoid this because they are losing with their loss in sales. 

I only gave them 2 stars because their coffee is crack."}
{"text":"I frequent this location as its within walking distance of my home. They seem to have recently gotten new staff and the new bunch is very unfriendly and slooooow. The drive thru is always pretty slow but the interaction with baristas is usually much more friendly and personable. They seem to have their more experienced baristas in the drive thru or at least those who are much better at understanding customer service. I was just inside a few minutes ago and it took over 2 minutes to be acknowledged at the register (I was the only person in line.) I didn't receive a smile, a hello, or any form of acknowledgement. I was just about to walk out when a young lady finally approached the register and said \"sorry we're busy what can I get you.\" Definitely not like the experience at any other Starbucks location I've been to I the valley."}
{"text":"Thank you for supporting our local community events with coffee donations. Today you provided ice for the 8th year in a row for our community picnic. Oh, and your coffee and lattes are great too!"}
{"text":"Painfully slow...time after time.  I keep hoping to have a positive experience, to no avail. Drive the extra couple minutes to the new one by Target. 100% better."}
{"text":"always very quick and extremely polite. i usually only go here as a treat during a bad day at work and they ALWAYS cheer me up."}
{"text":"This is the worst Starbucks ever!!! I've been to ones that are not corporate, but this one takes the cake. 

I ordered oatmeal. It only comes with 1 topping they say. You don't even get brown sugar or stevia to sweeten with. Everything is $1.00 extra. You want a banana... that's $3.50. In the end, a normal oat meal will cost you $10.00 for something that would be $4.00. 

The baristas were chatty and rude. Tropicana really needs to reevaluate this Starbucks."}
{"text":"I work in the area and come to this location a lot, it's kept clean and fresh looking and I have always received great service and coffee.
The staff are always pleasant and friendly which is a bonus early in the morning! 

This location offers armchairs, window and patio (summer) seating for sitting options but these go quickly as this is a smaller location."}
{"text":"This is my local Starbucks, but I feel lucky to have it. The staff is really phenomenal, which makes all the difference when you visit frequently. 

I don't order byzantine lattes or anything, but I've watched them honour plenty of incredibly complex orders smoothly and efficiently. 

I also like how the decor and layout of the store makes optimal use of its waterfront real estate! Maybe it's tough not to, but still. :)"}
{"text":"This is the worst Starbucks in the entire state. After giving my order I literally waited over 20 minutes to get it. There was only one other car in front of me. The baristas inside were too busy talking to each other then serving customers."}
{"text":"Sadly this is the Starbucks closest to my house and they are the worst. Today was just the icing on the cake. Ordered 2 chai tea lattes, a Carmel macchiato, and a s'mores frappucino. I will admit they were busy being that it was Mother's Day but I should not have to wait 30 minutes! While waiting for my drinks 5 other people got snores frap before mine. Customers that came in after me received their drinks before me. On top of all that once I asked to see a manager so I could get my refund the manager (Tina) was the one making he drinks. I have been a retail store manager for over 10 years in million dollar companies.....why is your manager the only person making drinks??? Managers should never be stuck in a position they need to be available to make sure things like this don't happen. Starbucks is getting to the point where I don't care how convenient they are I will find another option."}
{"text":"So happy this new Starbucks has a drive thru! Though the prices will break your bank they are ALWAYS consistent with my coffees and teas unlike ALL of their competition. I know I have a 99.9% chance my drink will be made correctly and taste just like it did yesterday, the day before and the day before that etc. not like other coffee shops as there's a good chance when I take a sip  my head will explodes because its made wrong and have to get out of my car to go in and get something remade or throw it out. So I guess it's worth the price at Starbucks  LOL! Employees are always pleasant here and even if there is a long line at the drive thru it moves fast. 
TIP...Did you ever have their iced green tea lemonade sweetened? Or a stronger one.... black tea lemonade sweetened? Perfect for summer...so refreshing and delicious!"}
{"text":"The SLOWEST drive thru Starbucks in Las Vegas.  Hate complaining but hoping that maybe they can figure out how to speed it up."}
{"text":"I go to this Starbucks on a regular basis seeing as it is the only one close to where I live and on the way to the freeway. Generally I get just regular coffee which for the most part is hard to screw up but lately I've changed it up seeing as it is hot out. My order has changed to Iced Green tea without sweetener. Seems pretty easy right? Wrong! Normally I don't have an issue with this particular Starbucks other than the fact that it is unusually slow. Today for instance I ordered two trenta Iced green teas no sweetener for my boyfriend and I. There was only one other person in the Starbucks at this time, who had come in after I did and one person in the drive-thru. However it took a good 5-8 minutes to get what is an easy drink to make. You pour green tea about a third of the way in the cup fill with water and add ice. The Starbucks employees were running into each other and acting as if it was an 8am rush. When my drinks came out my order was right but my boyfriends was wrong they gave him iced black tea and not green tea. We brought this to the attention of the barista and he said he must of poured the wrong one. After another 5-8 minutes over waiting my boyfriend still got what looked and tasted to be black tea. The barista insisted that it was green tea! Green tea has a slight orange green tint to it and is a much lighter taste. Black tea however is a dark orange brown color and had a bold bitter taste when not sweetened. Do to being pressed for time the issue was not pushed any long and my boyfriend left unsatisfied with their service. I miss the days when I would go to this Starbucks and they would now my order and get it right every time."}
{"text":"This Starbucks location is the absolute WORST location in Las Vegas. I could understand the extremely long lines inside and out if they could actually make a decent drink. I'm not sure what's going on in there but I would say that 60% of the drinks I order here are sub par. To make matters worse the staff is rude and inconsiderate. Everyone knows that after 12 noon they only brew pikes roast. Every other Starbucks location is happy to do a pour over of any other roast you'd like, however, not the location at Cactus and Decatur. They flat out refuse to make a pour over coffee or act like don't know what I'm talking about. The only reason I continue to suffer the abomination that is this Starbucks location is because unfortunately, they are the only coffee shop in the southern highlands area. I feel they need to provide more training for their employees in terms of actual drink making and customer service."}
{"text":"Sweet small location located at the corner of finch and Bathurst. This place is very small with small seating area it can get very busy all the time. The staff are very friendly and welcoming. Great place and very impressed"}
{"text":"This is a nice Starbucks. It's located one level below street level in an upscale food court. Lot's of people in and out, yet it was fine for cooling my jets for an hour or so. The walkway of the mall above has opaque tiles and you can see people walk over as they hustle and bustle on their way.

I wish I had one of their Tevanas right now."}
{"text":"It's a Starbucks. I loitered here for an hour with a cup of their coffee. No one kicked us out. It was good."}
{"text":"Stopped into this location to wait for my son while he takes an exam up the street.  The store on D.I. was too crowded so here I am.  Why did the chick at the register just stare at me...even after I said hi?  Ugh. I will deal with the crowd at D.I./Eastern next time.  Disappointed...not surprised I guess."}
{"text":"I know better than to visit this location.  However, I had to go to Trader Joe's and they are in the same parking lot so I figured with time being of the essence, I'd try this Starbucks again.  Everyone deserves a second chance, yeah?  Actually in their case, it's more like 3 or 4. :/ First of all, the Frappuccino.  Everyone knows how expensive they are so I don't feel it's too much to ask to have it taste good.  I ordered my usual Java Chip with 4 pumps of Frappuccino roast.  Easy, yeah?  The first one was too icy which makes for a watery drink when the ice melts.  The second one, I saw him put three pumps of Frap roast when it was I ordered it with four.  He told me it had four so I said, \"Ok.\"  He was nice.  Maybe making Frappuccino isn't his thing.  I'm sure he's good at other things at the store.  The third do-over, this white girl with brown hair in a pony tail made.  She looked miserable and it wasn't just because of me because she had the same look on her face BEFORE I had an issue with my drink. Working with the public sucks.  I get it.  I worked retail for 15 years.  BUT you NEVER allow your stank attitude to come through the way ol girl's did today.  Smh.  She got all smart ass and said, \"I put six pumps of Frappuccino roast in it.\"  Lawd...I never asked for 6.  It tasted horrible just like the first two so I was like, \"F this. Ima get my money back.\"  The over all mood and personality of the staff at this store is sad.  Fix it.  Don't nobody want to pay for these expensive drinks served with a sh!t attitude.  With so many Starbucks in the area that have great service and better attitudes, there's no need to go to this one.  

The one good thing:

I also ordered an ice coffee for my daughter with soy and vanilla.  She is enjoying her drink.  No issues with hers.  Thank you to dude for making her drink right."}
{"text":"Enjoy coffee and was craving a double espresso toasted coconut frappuccino. When ordering Starbucks stop shipping the toasted coconut syrup. Not one to complain but Kevin at the register was kind of rude about situation. Between taping his finger and sighing while trying to figure out what wanted to order, since was not in mods for anything else. If it wasn't for him being rude would not have issue."}
{"text":"This place use to be awesome. The last two times I went it's been slow and the orders were wrong. I watched the staff make four orders that came in after me before starting my 5 teas (literally one of the easiest drinks on the menu). This time, the order took twenty minutes during a slow time and I asked 3 times for one of the drinks to not be sweetened because it's for a diabetic .... it was sweetened. I spend about $2k on Starbucks a month and I won't be returning to this location. I'm sad the cute African American girl is no longer there. She was accurate and always eager to help."}
{"text":"Mediocre service. I figured I'd give them a few months to \"figure it out\" and get their ish together since they just opened. However, service is always slow, even when there is no line. Customer service is lacking in every department. It just feels like they don't really train they're people well here. It's too bad, because this location is beautiful! I love the atmosphere and big open space. We will see if they improve within the next year or so."}
{"text":"Always friendly staff and if you ever need a good start to your day, go and get a latte. That rhymed . Beverages are always good. Ive been to come starbucks that just sometimes dont make it right. Here its always perfect."}
{"text":"This was the location I always came to because I have lots of appointments at dignity down the street so I always came here right after.... until today. I ordered my drink... and waited 20 minutes to get to the window.... My phone was at 10% when I got in line so that shows how long I waited... The girl working the drive thru today at 430 greeted everyone as soon as they pulled up to the window and apologized for the wait... when I pulled up she closed the window and didn't come until 2 minutes of me sitting there.... My phone died as she was opening the window... I couldn't pay for my drink so I had to leave without one... I was livid... i had just waited 20 minutes for absolutley nothing... if she would have greeted me as fast as she did everyone else I would have been able to pay for my drink... and I would have left with my drink but instead I left with nothing but wasted time.... so annoyed right now...."}
{"text":"I've been to hundreds of Starbucks locations, in a dozen countries.  Hand on heart here, I'm not exaggerating.

THIS location is the THE best Starbucks location I have ever been to, in twenty years of hanging with the green mermaid.

Some locations like the one in downtown Ann Arbor have an wicked \"lower level\" where students can hang out.  There's a location in West Virginia where everyone behind the counter is singing.  I've paid $12 for a Latte in Bern.  I've seen angry baristas arguing in front of customers; I've seen smooth baristas work under immense pressure (and constant flirtation) in the middle of a Pride Parade; I've even seen the lead singer for the Cranberries introduce herself to the guy who starred in the Austin Powers movies over tea.  

Nope.  This location is the best of them all.

The service here is way, way better than average.  To a person, there is a consistent and persistent commitment to friendliness that, even by Starbucks's standards, is superb.  

All the other stuff is strong, too.  The store is always clean, it's spacious, the Wifi is good, the condiment bar is located perfectly, it has a drive-thru and a generous parking lot, there's a patio that gets lots of summer sunshine, it's right by a bicycle path that goes to the beach, accessibility is good for people on four wheels, -and- it has three private bathrooms.

But it all comes back to that service.  Whoever's running this store, frankly, should be doing something bigger than running a coffee shop, because it's clear that they have a knack for instilling joy in people around them.  That's a powerful skill."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this location, since it's the closes for me but I've given them so many chances and my drinks always tastes so wrong... friendly service but never been satisfied with any of my drinks :'("}
{"text":"I buy Starbucks a lot, but every time I come to this location they seem to screw up.... So much to the point that I drive elsewhere now, once is fine but when your paying premium prices on drinks there's non room for fuck ups.... Maybe I'm just used to better service from other locations? Or maybe they just get my order wrong even after I repeat myself and they reassure me as though they heard me the first time...its very disappointing"}
{"text":"Ah... Good old Starbucks! One of the best coffee places on the planet! This location is very nice. It has free wi-fi, lots of seating, and real friendly staff. The drive-thru takes for ever!!! But hey, lots of people love starbucks, right? Overall, if you like starbucks, this is a nice place to go."}
{"text":"The \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" that pops up after giving this place two stars could not have been a better choice of words to describe the service here.

I do understand that they may get busy during the day but when it slows down to one person every 5 minutes (as it was with my visit) then take the time to relax and speak with your customers. I don't think the coffee is the best in the world; I have had better. So in my opinion, in order to keep people coming to your store, you should have excellent customer service skills. My order was taken, name taken, money accepted and then I moved right along.

Next time, I will find another location. If there is not one to be found then I would rather purchase coffee from the gas station."}
{"text":"The service was pleasant but my partner and I both got sick after having their mocha today... unsure what they put in their drinks anymore"}
{"text":"Went there after the harry springoff 8k run with my friends and the manager gave us all free hot chocolate to congratulate us for the run. Friendly staff and the hot choc was delish"}
{"text":"Doesn't accept rewards or discounts. That's not starbucks. Over $7 bucks for a vanilla latte... geez. I'm not drunk enough for that lol"}
{"text":"Only three things needed for 5 stars at a Starbucks. 


1. Friendly batistas. 
2. Nitro.
3. Plenty of seating."}
{"text":"This location has a very fast drive thru. All of my drinks come out perfect, even with my special requests. The customer service is always great."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the biggest Starbucks I've been to in the Vegas area. This was my first visit to this location. We started to drive through, but the line was long and continued to grow as we approached. We opted to walk in and found a long line inside as well. The friendly staff got through the orders quickly and customers drink were appearing quickly. This place is huge inside with a variety of merchandise, food items and coffee for brewing at home.  Of course they offer free wi-fi and have plenty of outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Just ordered an iced lemonade, order was put in and filled as iced latte, had to wait to get a new and didn't have time to get the price difference (if there was one... but don't know for sure). Note to self, be extra vigilant when ordering as to not waste time in the future at this location."}
{"text":"This is a great Starbucks to curl up in a big leather chair and chat the afternoon away with a friend.

It's convenient to get to from both the east and westbound lanes of Kingston Road, there's plenty of parking and they even have a drive-thru!

The store itself isn't the biggest I've seen making their selection of gifts and mugs quite limited but the service is great and it's just a really pleasant atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Its a convenient location, but it gets busy. Be prepared to wait in line. They have limited seating and sometimes it tends to get loud, I think it would help if they expanded this location. They offer Wifi at this location but i've always had difficulty logging in."}
{"text":"Noon on a Saturday - line not too long, ordered simple short regular coffee and it came quickly, tasted great as always.  Great service, great coffee (maybe not *the* best, but consistently an 8 out of 10, in contrast with Tim's, which ranges from 2/10 to 8/10 depending on the day, humidity, planetary alignment, and other unknown factors).."}
{"text":"Quick and easy at 6am. The coffee Is usually hot. It is convenient being next to our building.  Service is spot on."}
{"text":"This is part of my morning ritual to have a double-long espresso and prepare my day's work.

Being an habitual patron, the regular staff has come to serve me with impeccable timing.  On the same breath, staff turn-over seems minimal which is a good sign for stable management and 

Personal commendation to Tina, a staff with a radiant smile and attentiveness.

The setting is in a commercial center with enormous parking and ease of drive.  The afternoon patrons are numerous, youthful and practically no place to sit.

The business is representative of Starbuck's way of style."}
{"text":"I thought Starbucks was famous for their service. Two miserable baristas at this location today. Wanted to argue about the cold chocolate he gave me, before grudgingly mailing a hot one."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore Starbucks and this one is in such a pretty location! The drinks are delicious and the staff is skilled. Wish it was closer to where I work so I could go there more."}
{"text":"Slowest Starbucks in the world. I go everyday and it doesn't seem to improve. One star since it's close to my house. Be prepared for at least 20 minutes in the drive thru, and that's on a good day with three cars in line"}
{"text":"Do not use the mobile app to order to this location. My order took just under an hr to get. I placed a mobile order so my brother could go pick up for me while I ran an errand nearby, after 45min and him saying they're still having him wait I had to walk over and at first expressed patiently that I understand their busy but the wait has been ridiculous. That quickly changed to me having to expressed my frustrations as they were not seeming to have any urgency in taking care of my order. 
They started with their made up excuses as to why my order was not ready. They told me \"oh I thought you left\"...I was never there to begin with...they said \"oh someone stole your whole order\"...my brother had the food order but not the drinks...they said my brother never made the problem aware to them...my brother is very very verbal and made the situation clear...and after showing them my order they new exactly which order I was. Took them a while longer but after an hr we finally got our order only for me to drive away and realize my drink just tasted like hot milk. The service was horrible and it wasn't even worth it. Sucks that this team runs the closest coffee shop to us."}
{"text":"This place is so nice! I'm here every day, sometimes twice a day. Lacey is my favorite, she is so understanding if I mess up or forget something! Shes helpful with getting me to work, and she always has new suggestions for drinks that actually sound personalized and not like a robot suggesting a new drink. There's also a girl with short hair and glasses (I think it's Teresa, but I could be wrong. Sorry if I got it wrong!) who's always so nice. Props to the manager. I recognize when it gets busy and things get a little slow, but they always make up for it by doing the right thing and making sure the customers are happy and on their way, satisfied. I do my best to go quite a few times before I decide to write a review, and I think this one is long overdue. Good job! I go the extra few miles just for this place. Thanks for making my work week a little easier! See you all tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day!"}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood Starbucks. Service here is horrible. Since moving to this area I have only been to this location 5 times and so far 5 / 5 times they got my drink wrong  and its not a hard drink to make - Iced Chai with an add shot of expresso. They seem to get confused by the expresso part.  Chick working the drive through is rude and impatient, cut me off before I was even done my order the last time.

Oh well, I make better coffee at home anyways."}
{"text":"????????????downtown?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"The staff is really friendly and the building is always clean but they often mess up on drink orders. I live very close so I go here often and only occasionally is my drink made the way I asked it to be made. I would recommend double checking on your order just to be sure its correct!"}
{"text":"Rude workers! They closed at 9 but apparently closed their registers much earlier. I'm standing, waiting for them to take my order, by the register. A male worker walked right by me, the other two cackling hens making drinks for people who apparently already ordered, just kept looking at me. Finally, one of them asks what I'm waiting for, and I tell her I wanted a coffee, just a regular coffee. She proceeds to tell me that they're closed, registers are already closed. It's 9:01 and I was already standing there for at least 5 minutes! I said I just want a regular coffee, with attitude she says they're closed! My husband then says they should have a sign that says they're closed. The worker rudely points at their sign that says they close at 9. So happy he didn't go ballistic on these lazy asses!"}
{"text":"Some of the baristas make my drink perfect and I always hope they are the ones making it. Info daily and one out of 7 days a week someone makes it and it's bitter. I can usually tell by the color if it's right or not but in the drive thru there's not much you can do to have it corrected. I don't taken a drink before I drive off, though I'd like to. I always order a venti cafe vanilla frap with no wip and a shot of espresso."}
{"text":"I wanted to grab something quick in the morning before heading off to see the Hoover Dam so I got in line at this Starbucks. I ordered my usual Venti latte Macchiato and a banana.. it wasn't until after I paid with my SB app that I noticed it cost me over $9! ..what a rip off!"}
{"text":"All things considered, this is one of the best Starbucks I've visited. Parking is ample, seating is available (including a patio for when it's nice), and the staff does well. In all, they keep it tight for being the only coffee shop in the area. That said, I'm pretty much over Starbucks as a brand and an industry leader. It's not reflective of this store -- which is a 5/5 for being a Starbucks -- but the recent overall corporate positions. 

Now, hey, I get it -- you've got investors and profits to be made etc. And I don't discount so many of the good things Starbucks has done to date. But that goodwill, on which Starbucks built its brand, is ever-eroding with every new corporate release and product announcement seeming more in line with something you'd expect to hear from Coca-Cola or Yum! rather than Starbucks. For that reason alone, I'll grab a Circle K coffee when I am in the area rather than visit, what is an excellently operated and well staffed, Starbucks.

{"text":"If you're not going to fill up this coffee cup that I paid 6.00 for (pumpkin spice latte) then I will make sure every media source is aware that you're scamming them. If I wanted a tall, I would have ordered a tall."}
{"text":"Typical Starbucks.  Small patio fronting Queen Street East.  Fireplace in sitting area.  Average."}
{"text":"Busy because it's connected to the mall but most people take their orders to go. Lots of seating spread apart for elbow room. A number of parents with kids so not a quiet place to hang out. Friendly cashiers, speedy baristas, well stocked food case: a good place to meet up at the mall."}
{"text":"Located right on the corner of Consumers Road and Victoria Park. Great access for pedestrians but a pain in the butt for drivers who have to park in the back and need to walk to the front. 

Friendly cashiers and baristas, clean place with clean bathrooms. Busy establishment with tables inside and out but no drive through.

Standard offerings but the lattes seem weaker in caffeine strength than other branches, so you might need to add an extra shot of espresso.

PS Whoever created the chalk signs, you are a talented artist; my pictures don't do you justice."}
{"text":"Excuse me, why is my grande green tea frappe that I usually get for $4.45, over $7 here? Oh cause we're in Aria. What?! This urked me so bad but they already made it since it took forever to charge my account! Go to the one right outside of here. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Go across the street to the Albertsons Starbucks. This one is CRAZY crowded at all times. I went inside simply to beat the wait at the drive thru only to have my coffee ice cold, and I made sure to say \"hot\" twice! It was clearly not even attempted to be heated (supposed to be a hot mocha) on top of being disgustingly bitter. Since I'd already been there an HOUR (would have left if I hadn't already paiand had somewhere to be I just choked it down. Just avoid it unless you like throwing money away."}
{"text":"I want to thank the morning people from today 6-15-18 at this location. You guys went above and beyond the call of duty and I appreciate you guys. I placed an order through postmates and on my end it said what I ordered. On your end, it showed something else. Thank you for being patient and helping me get my correct drinks. As for postmates, can say the same for them. Thank you morning Starbucks crew."}
{"text":"I'll go into this review in more detail when I return home but this is absolutely the WORST of their franchise I have ever encountered! Couldn't even redeem my free birthday drink, their computer wouldn't use my good card to register my credit and $1 for a cup of ice. Bill in total $7 for a venti frapp and $7 of pastries. Just irritating more than anything since we expect a universal standard of quality and service when we revisit such vendors.  A fellow customer and I bantered in agreement when he just asked for a cup of ice water as well."}
{"text":"This Starbucks just keep getting worse. Where is management and why aren't they doing their job to make sure employees are cleaning the store? It is absolutely filthy in here. The floor looks like it hasn't been swept in a while and there is a ton of dust on the display islands. Went to pick something up to look at it and after I put it back down I had a layer of dust and dirt on my hand. I have been to other Starbucks and they are much cleaner than this."}
{"text":"Literally just bought a coffee. The woman who rang me up was so incredibly rude. Because of her long fingernails she literally told me she did not want to reload my card. I wonder how Starbucks would feel about that? There are so many Starbucks in Las Vegas... Do not waste your money at this one!"}
{"text":"Every time I go it's at least 15-20 min wait and the drinks taste like water even when u get an extra shot is still taste nasty  never going back"}
{"text":"This Starbucks is super duper crowded during the morning rush hour. It is attached to the Westin, so it is even more crowded. there is an outdoor seating as well. 
I couldn't find the wifi for some reason, so I used the Westin's wifi instead. Hahaha."}
{"text":"The reality is that for a real coffee lover, Starbucks coffee is pretty terrible. With so many local shops in the Beach that take true pride in their coffee, and roast in house, there is little reason to keep coming back to Starbucks...at least for straight up coffee. Their more elaborate espresso based drinks are passable because they are hidden in their various syrups and sauces. Their teas are okay, but pretty basic in comparison to the dedicated tea houses which have become popular. Their food is prepackaged and unappetizing. Their baked goods are okay, but far from fresh. This location is usually pretty busy and, as a result, loud. Often there is a line. Unfortunately it is not always the cleanest either. It's always interesting to read about what happened to Starbucks in Australia..."}
{"text":"I dunno. It's Starbucks. Expensive but good coffee. Staff is always friendly and offers suggestions of you aren't sure what to order. One main issue and sorry if I'm not being PC and I think this issue more is with Tower City and not Starbucks.....the level of people saying they are homeless and want some change. There is open seating here and most times non Starbucks customers are just sitting here taking a nap. This is why I give Tower City one star and less if I was able."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst Starbucks.  Their turn around time sucks, and 7 out of 10 items will get my order wrong.  And the other day to find coffee beans in my drink was terrible. 

Wish there was another Starbucks in southern highlands."}
{"text":"Pros: close to home, drive thru, some of the employees (Angie, Aimee) and drinks are always made accurately.
Cons: slowest drive thru ever!!!!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE customer service. The barrista was not only rude, he was combative when I asked him to remake my drink since it had gotten cold while waiting to pay. This is a busy location, so I understand there was an especially long wait since one of the registers was down. However, when I picked up my drink it had significantly cooled, and I was met with all sort of attitude when I requested that he remake it."}
{"text":"The employees here are nice and they're typically busy doing their jobs. The reason I give this location only 3 stars is because I come here pretty often and it seems like every time I order a drink it takes about 10-15 minutes to get my drink. Almost like they forgot about it. Now you could ask why I don't just ask for my drink and I'd say that's because I've ordered my drink once, I shouldn't have to do it again. Unfortunately, I can't give more stars because like I said this has happened on multiple occasions."}
{"text":"This location was really strong when it opened. Today we went to try the new Blonde and the service was way under staffed.  We ordered a bagel and birthday cake pop that we had to ask for as they forgot to make it. 

The back counter and the floor of the employee area was very messy and dirty. The actual customer area was just as bad. The floor look liked it had not been cleaned in days. 

We love the location, but service is slipping."}
{"text":"This is the Starbucks inside of Sick Kids. To get here, use the Elizabeth street entrance. Lines are long around lunch and during breakfast time but they are quick and efficient."}
{"text":"The barista here asked my friend if he does drugs and smokes weed when we put in our order...... Uhhh. Unprofessional. Also I ordered an iced coffee and I have no idea what they made me instead but it was awful. Weird."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best Starbucks I have ever been to! The staff are always happy and friendly, very efficient and they make great coffee! Coming here first thing in the morning was a great way to start the day."}
{"text":"Can we duplicate this location and put it on my side of town?! I find myself on the east side of town a lot before work so I come to this location a lot. They're doing everything right here; the store is always clean, the staff is super friendly, and my order is always up quick no matter how busy they are!"}
{"text":"I'm giving one star for location as it's 2 stop lights up from my house and another one for coffee. However the service here is absolutely terrible. My drink order is relatively simple (6 shots of espresso with coconut milk and SF vanilla syrup over ice) yet I'm always waiting at least 20 minutes no matter how slow or busy they are. If I order ahead the wait is even longer because they claim my order didn't print. 

I was at another Starbucks a couple days ago and the person in line in front of me ordered 2 full carriers of drinks (8 drinks to be exact, 6 of them were frappuccinos) and I got my drink in less than 5 minutes. So there's no excuse for this location to give less than sub par service other than they give zeros fucks."}
{"text":"Love the baristas here! They're all so friendly. I also like that they have plenty of seating, unlike many other Starbucks in town lol. The bad thing: they have the crappiest wifi connection. Even when there aren't so many people using it, it's pretty slow. I gave up trying to study there, but overall it's a lovely place to go."}
{"text":"Very friendly at this location and the drinks are always perfect I love the flat white"}
{"text":"This Starbucks is one of my favourites. It is big and nicely designed. It is also next to Costco, so you can grab your coffee once you are done with your shipping. I am also surprised by the staff, which is friendly and nice. All in all, a nice place to go and grab a coffee or stay in and take a break."}
{"text":"it took 20 mins to get my drink today. also this starbucks is always full of LOUD people! such an extremely loud environment during the day.. the evenings might be different. not a good place to study."}
{"text":"Honestly....they messed my drink. 3 shots espresso, 3 pumps white mocha, 2 pumps toffee nut on ice in venti cup.... don't be adding any extra!! I didn't want  half and half, milk, cream.... whatever it is you added in... I just wanted 3 shots espresso, 3 pumps white mocha, 2 pumps toffee nut on ice in venti cup..."}
{"text":"Don't generally go for starbucks, now they have A GOOD blonde flat white.. This location is nicer than just about any other in Toronto, staff moves quickly!"}
{"text":"It's a starbucks in a Chapters.  The location is ok, great for perusing the store when you're in need of a caffeine fix."}
{"text":"This location is busy and its difficult to find a seat here.  The next closest Starbucks is at Fairview Mall....so...it is what it is.  At lunch time during the week, it's really busy and the line up is long.  Since there are offices nearby, people often come and get like 4 fancy drinks in one order...so that makes the line slower.  If you come during an off-peak time, you're likely to get your drink quickly, but may still have issues finding a seat if that's the kind of experience you're hoping for."}
{"text":"This Starbucks is close to my current workplace.  The parking lot is large, yet people can't seem to choose a lane.  It's mildly dangerous getting here.

The drinks are ok, and the staff is efficient.  If you can get here, the drinks are good."}
{"text":"Good location.  There aren't any coffee shops in this area (directly). There is a large patio which is nice on a summers day even though there is lots of traffic."}
{"text":"Floor is a mess, looks like a war zone. The pleasant server asks me, \"would too like to try our new muffin?\" I said sure, thinking she meant sample, as in free. Nope! So now I have this muffin, which is all right. Kinda jam filled sugary thing. 

Usually Starbucks are quite clean. This one appears to be taking its cues from the adjacent gas station. Plus are they chasing Tim Hortons coat tail that hard, with muffins as their big new offer? They should find something distinctive."}
{"text":"Comfy chairs, tables, & study areas are available at this on-campus location. There's plenty of space & can be quiet when school isn't in session. Otherwise, it's loud & crowded. This Starbucks is a good place to grab a cuppa caffeine when on campus. But I wouldn't go out of my way to get here. You cannot redeem star rewards here because they're not a corporate store. But you can still use a Starbucks card to pay. You won't collect any stars for purchases though. Also, no wi-fi."}
{"text":"Personally I think this is the best Starbucks store around. I'm from the Seattle are, I should know. They have the best customer service between Nevada, California, Oregon, Idaho AND Washington hands down. They are always accurate and if by some slim chance there is a mistake they are quick and very apologetic to correct it. Considering some of the rude ass customers I have heard in this store and in the drive thru, this team is seriously amazing. After having a store in WA argue with me about MY drink, this store is like FRESH AIR! Please keep it up!!! Your team is AH-MAZING!"}
{"text":"I love the vintage atmosphere inside especially with the chandeliers.. The service was good but kinda slow."}
{"text":"small Starbucks with limited seating. People often share tables to take advantage of the free wifi. The patio is a plus though this stretch of Yonge at the 401 is especially loud."}
{"text":"This Starbucks sucks. Let me repeat, this Starbucks sucks. I had a bad experience the whole time that I was there. The barista who was at the register didn't look up or acknowledge me when I went up to her. After awhile, she just gave a rude, \"What do you want?\" and then turned around to laugh with her coworkers. I had to repeat myself. I ordered my drink and asked for a bagel with cream cheese. It took this woman a whole minute to find where the bagels were placed in their display case. She took my payment, put my bagged bagel on the counter and walked away without saying another word. My drink was made wrong, but I was already tired of dealing with them so I just left. I wish I didn't even have to give them a star, but I guess it is alright since my bagel was good."}
{"text":"My review is based on numerous visits over the past two years: 1 star for friendliness, 2nd star for location, 3rd star for cleanliness. 

I would have to say that yes the wait is painful. Example: on my way to work just after 6am I was the only person at the drive thru & I could see the store was empty but I still had to wait 10min for an iced coffee. Example 2: after work coffee run the wait of over 20min at the drive thru. 

The lattes & iced coffees are not as strong as other locations I've been to but they are always happy to remake it for me (that could explain the long waits) 

I did give them a star for friendliness but I would've given more stars if they get my order right more often. 

It's a very clean & well stocked store with treats & bottles drinks. 

Location star is because it's close to home & it has convenient exits."}
{"text":"Lazy, lazy staff!! Came here yesterday afternoon. No one was in line when I got there. Ordered my drink and 2 people followed afterwards. There were 5 staff and only 1 was working making the drinks. Everyone else was on their headset talking. That 1 person working was also making the drinks for the drive thru. 
Took them 10 minutes to make a refresher."}
{"text":"Don't come to this Starbucks! Ordered two tall teas and they were basically 20% tea, 80% ice. Way too much ice for 3$ drinks. Couldn't even enjoy my drink. I'll be going to a different location from now on."}
{"text":"The barista we just ordered from five minutes ago was SO SWEET! She had rainbow eyeshadow. It's my mom's birthday and she wrote Happy Birthday on the cup and decorated it! I wish we got her name, but hopefully you all know who we're talking about! She went out of her way to make it extra special and we wanted to let someone know that she was delightful."}
{"text":"The place is huge! I always find a spot to sit at and do business paperwork! Staff is friendly... Lot's of regulars here! It's opened late too!!"}
{"text":"I love this location. My first impression was that it was very tidy and clean. There are also tons of parking since it is not in a busy location. I am mostly impressed by the service here. The staff are all so nice. The environment is very welcoming and there's tons of seats, there isn't any reason why one wouldn't like this location. This is my new go-to study spot whenever I am in the area."}
{"text":"The new design is great. Love that it is a drive through right across the street from work. I think this was a great move. It is a lot busier now then it used to be with the added drive through. That being said... The layout is confusing.  If you are not going through the drive through, it feels like you are going in the back way. The main doors are in the patio behind a gate instead of a normal entrance. The layout inside is not great for meeting either. This is definitely a drive through place with some seating as opposed to other Starbucks. Product and customer service is the same though."}
{"text":"Am I really writing a review of Starbucks? I guess I am. Just used the drive through here as it's close to CSN and the one on Rainbow can get really packed (and difficult to use the drive through with their setup). 
I don't know if I've ever dealt with a less attentive barista. Friendly sand smiley enough, just not retaining any info coming through the speaker box. I ordered tea, w milk, honey, and egg bites. She specifically asked how much honey - 3 packets - and what kind of egg bites, bacon or egg whites - bacon. When I got to the window, no milk or honey, and egg bites were egg whites. So had to ask for the milk and honey again, gave me FIVE honey packets, then had to ask for a stirrer, gave me FIVE stirrers. I didn't realize the egg bite situation until after since I was driving. 
None of this is a big deal, but come on - just listen when someone's talking and answering your questions. I know some people have insanely complicated orders; how in the world can you get those right when you can't remember what goes in a simple tea or what version of one out of only two varieties of egg bites someone orders. And super wasteful - five stirrers for one cup. Like seriously - it's just dumb."}
{"text":"This Starbucks is constantly out of food items and never has tea available. Been open for a while now.  Also every Starbucks of ever been to, the wind moves fairly quickly. For some reason at the Starbucks Highway anywhere from 20 to 30 minutes, with 79 cars in front of me.

Save yourself the time hassle disappointment and wrong order. Skip this Starbucks. It is awful"}
{"text":"Wow, they let dogs in here with no leash. Isn't that a health code violation??? Kinda gross."}
{"text":"This is one of the 2 Starbucks I use to interview date subjects from the online dating site. It provides sufficient anonymity that no barista ever notices I never meet the same gentleman twice (more a comment on the gentleman sadly).

The previous reviewer mentioned it had a new communal bar. That's gone now. It's back to the previous layout which is  commonplace for all Starbucks. I'm disappointed they removed it b/c the communal bar emphasizes the community atmosphere, and the hope of striking conversations with other people (notice I want to be friendly, and Toronto / circumstances keep thwarting me).

Otherwise, nothing really stands out. Uniform experience across Starbucks."}
{"text":"This is the super size Starbucks location with drive-thru, large dining area (no, they do not take your order), and even larger counter with line up space to boot. The bathrooms are not built to match the super size ambiance. It is still 2 (?), but definitely 1 unisex bathroom with a long line-up.

It's conveniently located outside Tommy Thompson Park so after my MEC races, I eat a satisfying bacon, gouda, egg breakfast sandwich!"}
{"text":"You'd think that an international franchise with locations worldwide would adhere to a basic level of hygiene. Well don't hold your breath: this location keeps dirty tables and flies buzzing around. ARGH!

It's a small location so keeping your 6 tables in the front clean is NOT a difficult endeavour. I conducted a small social experiment. I wiped my table down and left the dirty napkin on top of the counter where they call & bring out your specialty drinks. After a little under 2 hours (time I spent there), that napkin was still on the counter!

I am glad I only ordered a tea because I can only imagine how dirty the kitchen appliances used to make specialty drinks are!  I am disgusted that the 2 young women working the shift could not clean up the counter. Let alone deal with a fly buzzing around."}
{"text":"Unimpressed with the service because I arrived and the barista turned away to fill out the coffee makers. I was running a bit late and I asked her if I could get a flat white. She did obliged. But I noticed that once I left, she turned around to go back to filling the coffee makers, but immediately dropped that task to serve the man who walked in seconds later!

Whatever. I've experienced better at other Starbucks."}
{"text":"Veronica is a very thorough Barrista.
She asked me questions as to how I like my drink, blonde espresso prepared.
The restaurant is very clean and spacious."}
{"text":"When you are hot and tired you want something familiar- and with caffeine. Starbucks is the same everywhere, right? Not exactly. The drink I ordered was great.  I am frustrated that I cannot use my rewards. Why not? Then the cashier is grumpy, too? I wanted an ice water but was afraid to ask."}
{"text":"Have had mixed experiences here but there are a lot of problems.  Difficult drive through, not much seating, coffee not the best, poor recovery when they make mistakes.  I'm tired of this place for sure and Starbucks in general isn't what it used to be."}
{"text":"I'm still in shock. I just watched the barista drop my cup on the ground, pick it back up, and make my coffee. Disgusted! Taking this all the way to the top!!"}
{"text":"This starbucks is large and clean. The staff was super friendly for so early in the morning and there were a few other patrons on their laptops. It's perfect."}
{"text":"The wifi truly sucks here. You can't watch a video from YouTube. You can't do any work. They advertise free \"high speed\" wifi. They ought to live up to their claims."}
{"text":"So far so good at this new Starbucks.  I've mobile ordered most of the times I been here.  The very first time it wasn't ready, but since then my order has always been waiting for me with no errors.  Staff has been friendly too.  Love that it's only a block from my house."}
{"text":"Great location, comfy seating, open - airy - & always clean.  I tend to go in & ask what's new & yummy and give it a go. 
They Always give great suggestions and I'm never disappointed. 
Wish we had more places in our neighborhood like this."}
{"text":"I ordered a salted caramel latte and they gave me a caramel machietto, when I told them that was the wrong drink they had me waiting for about five or six minutes because they were taking other people. I then mentioned that I have to get back to work and I have no time for this, if I haven't paid for my drink already I would have walked out. I then also heard them mumbling the whole time about my salted caramel latte for some reason."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Starbucks in the area, I've noticed a shorter wait time for my orders. Staff is real nice and friendly. Today the store looked exceptionally clean considering how busy it was . I will definitely come back to this location when in the area."}
{"text":"The SLOWEST Starbucks I've ever been to. The employees are nice but extremely slow. As the other reviews said, do not come here if you're in a rush. It should not take 10 min to get an iced black coffee. Horrible."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service!!! They always make my drink just right and the very few times they didn't they fixed the problem with no hesitation!! The staff is very friendly and amazing!!! Although I live closer to different location I will drive the extra mile for the customer service!!"}
{"text":"Great service and a Drive-Thru, too!  Inside is clean and well-maintained.  Outside (limited) patio seating available.  Plenty of free parking."}
{"text":"I never, never write reviews.  But after being told they \"couldn't\" do something when I pay $6/$7 for a sandwich is a joke.  All I wanted was no cheese that comes on one of the sandwiches.  Every Starbucks I have ever went to has taken it off, no issues.  However, after she said she couldn't, and I corrected her.  She attempted telling me she was not able take it out of the packaging, even though this is how I have always ordered this sandwich (it has to come out of the packaging to be made any way.)   After I said this, she proceeded with \"I can try.\"  What a serious joke.  I literally spend so much money in this place, and to be treated this way about taking cheese off a panini is straight ridiculous!  I think I'm finally done with Starbucks.  Rant over."}
{"text":"Perfect caramel macchiato! Now waiting at drive through at this time. Unbelievable. No complains. Still it takes a long time to get your order"}
{"text":"The good thing about Starbucks is that no matter where you go, they have the same great service and coffee. This location has all the great elements that make up the Starbucks brand! Definitely be sure to stop in for an always great caffeine fix!"}
{"text":"This Starbucks in the Caesars food court isn't an official Starbucks where you can use your card or if there are any promos going on.
The prices are going to be a little higher as well.  
I came here on a Saturday afternoon and the wait to order took a while since there's only 2 registers open.  Luckily drinks were made a lot quicker so that balances things out.
They have some cool Las Vegas merchandise there as well which I was tempted to buy but ended up not doing so."}
{"text":"Somewhat narrow Starbucks with two very welcome unisex (don't have to ask for the key) washrooms in the back. It's in the heart of greektown. You can be assured this place is always busy. What kind of elevates it is its substantial patio space. A great place to sip a coffee during a warm day."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever. I'm currently in the drive thru for my second time and each time it has taken well over 10mins. I went inside one time and that took about 15 because all of the employees were joking around and couldn't care less about customer service."}
{"text":"Very very slow. They need to learn how to speed up da process. I've been to many SBs and this is da slowest. Time is valuable."}
{"text":"There's nothing like going into a Starbucks in being the first in line then the guy three behind me gets his ice coffee before I get my ice tea. When you confront the little girl (I use this because she has not reached adulthood based on the way she addressed the issue.) then I ask for a refund and of course she has her smart comment. Have a great day sir. Nice! I wrote this review a few months ago. I used to go to this Starbucks 3-4 times a week and now I won't go. Haven't been there since. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This was a cool Starbucks in this old neighborhood in Las Vegas. It's a bigger establishment than your usual Starbucks and it's very nice ambience. Very eclectic people coming in and out and I feel like I'm in Los Angeles or Nee York. Love the place and the feel. Come out and check this out when you're in the area!  Just had my coffee fix and my Bacon Gouda Sandwich. of course you have to have a lemon loaf with that order for sure. Yum !  Ready for my day to start!"}
{"text":"This might be the slowest Starbucks on the planet... Thought this new location would be convenient but it takes 3x as long as any other Starbucks...maybe 4x."}
{"text":"This is one of two Starbucks located in Chinook Centre, it's at the bottom of the escalators on the North side of the mall outside of Shoppers Drug Mart. The other Starbucks is located in Chapters on the South End, so if you're on this side of the mall go with this Starbucks and if you're on the other end go with the Chapters set-up. Both are extremely busy, basically all the time, so you're not going to do yourself any favours by rushing to the other location if the one you're at is lined-up. There used to be a third Starbucks in Target that was more of a hidden secret, but those days are gone with the failure of Target so we're back to two again.

They do offer limited seating slightly south of the kiosk as well, it's not always obvious since it's kind of behind an escalator but its there if you feel like chilling. Also being in the mall you have plenty of seating options elsewhere as well, but the seating area is where you'd want to head if you want to bask in their free Wi-Fi zone or hang with the Starbs crowd. There is a ton off free Wi-Fi elsewhere in the mall though, including Shaw Go Wi-Fi, so no need to really limit yourself. The Chapter's set-up is a bit better for chilling and relaxing, it even carries more of the usual Starbucks atmosphere you'd expect including the stereotypical Starbucks crowd with their MacBooks haha ;). Whereas the north side Starbucks is more of a grab and go location than anything. Also, mobile payments and rewards accepted here :). 

Everything considered I got to give this location a 3/5. Why? Simple, I think the Chapters location is slightly better and offers a more cozy feel (4/5) and because I haven't found a 5/5 Starbucks... yet ;). Don't expect a warm atmosphere or personable experience at this location, the majority of the time they're rushed, busy and basically just order takers trying to get customers in and out quick!"}
{"text":"Slowest Starbuck known to man kind. I wish there was a coffee bean close 0 stars not one"}
{"text":"This Starbucks needs a better lot! The line is always so long in the morning causing cars to line up in the street, stopping traffic, because there is not enough space in the parking lot. Besides this, they usually get the line moving pretty quickly and they always make my Chai Latte better than any other starbucks. They also keep good inventory. Too many times I've asked for my daily bacon and gouda sandwich at other locations and they are always out. This location always has anything I ask for on hand."}
{"text":"I have been sitting in this drive thru for about 15 minutes now in one spot. I don't care if there is a short wait but for like a few drinks, cmon. Pretty upset right now."}
{"text":"The drinks taste good as everywhere else but I can't shake the feeling that it is the Starbucks with the slowest service ever. 
From the register to waiting for your drink. The lines sometimes get so long that people wait on the street and the second register isn't opened in a timely fashion. 
Mobile orders make you feel like an idiot while 5 drinks or more get prepared while you stand around waiting for your drink. It's kind of like the feeling when you go to take care of something in person and the clerk keeps answering the phone for other customers and you wonder why you even bothered to come in person. 

Don't come here if you don't have 20 to 30 minutes to wait around during \"coffee-rush-hour\" like in the morning or during lunch break."}
{"text":"I just fast tested Dunkin donuts coffee compared to my triple shot Carmel machiotto. Idk how DD even sells coffee with a Starbucks nearby! Definitely worth it."}
{"text":"This Starbucks is always over crowded and you would be lucky to find somewhere to sit.

It's a shame because the staff are pretty nice and sometimes people take it out on them. It isn't their fault all the seats are taken, maybe Bayview Village needs its own Starbucks rather then only having this tiny one inside Chapters? 

Your next location would be at the Canadian Tire Gar Bar which does have a nice patio for the summer and somewhere to sit!"}
{"text":"I come to this location about once a week to work on homework and catch up with friends. I like coming to this location because the entire staff has been nothing but friendly and if I don't know what to order I receive awesome drink suggestions. 

This location is also great because it stays open until 10 pm and is way less crowded than the 24 hour Starbucks down the street."}
{"text":"This is my daily go to coffee place. 5 mins away from my home. Thank God they built that bridge on Cactus. What a time saver! 

They are super friendly here. They keep it clean. I love them. They remember me & my man's name & our drinks. That's pretty cool. 

One day, I was sitting there feeding my son a banana after my man left to go to work & one of workers was asking me what they can do to improve. That's nice that they do that. I'm already satisfied enough. 

I see complaints about them being slow but Southern Highlands is a busy area. I went in before work today & I got my Venti green tea latte in 5 mins. Maybe I missed the rush hour.

I'm so thankful that they now carry coconut milk. I love their double chocolate brownies there too. I see that they make fruit smoothies as well. It's also a plus that they have organic stuff."}
{"text":"I have to second Kathy C's review; this location is painfully slow.  It is the closest to my house but the last couple of times I've come in (always inside, won't even try their drive-thru service anymore,) have been mediocre at best.  This used to be a solid Starbucks location with a friendly and efficient staff.  Unfortunately, today I waited in line for more than 5 minutes behind one customer only...clearly she was either an off-duty employee or a regular customer.  Several of the baristas behind the counter were far more interested in chatting her up than helping the line of people waiting for service; a complete and blatant disregard for their customers' time.  They all acknowledged the line, then turned back to their conversation.  Oh, and they messed up my drink.  When you have so many nearby competitors, you should really step up your game."}
{"text":"Slow staff..uncaring..employees will let a line of 5 build while the stand behind the counter and talk and pretend to clean things"}
{"text":"It's Starbucks! The girls here are very friendly and happy. Makes for a great drink"}
{"text":"Pricey but a lot better prices than the Starbucks in Aria Hotel & Casino.  This one didn't seem to get as crowded so that is a plus."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous. The employees have NO sense of urgency. They are frequently out of products. The manager consistently walks away from the computer right as somone gets up in line."}
{"text":"I go to this Starbucks all the time! I absolutely love the guy who runs the drive-through window during the day! I'm not quite sure what his name is but he has curly light brown hair and it's usually worn in a ponytail! He is always so friendly and genuine! They are usually pretty fast in their drive-through and if not it's the customers' fault, not theirs! The only negative thing I have to say is that their location is a pain to get in and out of because of the traffic on Shea! Other than that this is a great Starbucks!"}
{"text":"We went for a birthday breakfast celebration. They ran out of plates to place the  breakfast sandwiches on with no apology other than here is the paper bag.. Secondly, we told one barista that it was my sister's birthday and she showed proof of that. That person did not tell the person ringing it up so when told of the mistake, she publicly rebuked us for not telling her personally.
I would never recommend this location. There are other Starbucks down on Queens Quay West and other coffee locations such as The Music Garden Cafe.I am very disappointed as my sister is from BC and i wanted her birthday morning to be special - WHICH IT WAS NOT!!!"}
{"text":"Situé tout à côté du CEGEP du Vieux-Montréal, à deux pas de l'UQAM et de la Grande Bibliothèque (BANQ) on retrouve-là la faune habituelle d'étudiantes et d'étudiants, reconnaissables entre mille à leur cahiers et leur lourds bouquins savants, tout concentrés dans leur bulle studieuse, imperturbables malgré les bruits ambiants. 

Malgré le nombre impressionnant d'ordinateurs portables (généralement des MacBook), des tablettes et des téléphones intelligents branchés, l'accès WIFI, gratuit, est assez performant. Idéal pour poster vos photos de vacances sur Facebook ou envoyer une vidéo sur YouTube. 

L'endroit est assez bruyant et il peut être assez difficile d'y tenir une conversation. À certaine période du jour, l'endroit est plein et il faut savoir être patient pour trouver un siège."}
{"text":"So Starbucks has always been my favorite place for coffee. But lately I've been so disappointed in my drink. I have always ordered a caramel macchiato used to come with caramel on the sides of the cup and ice! If I wanted a cup of milk I would have stayed home and kept my money. 
Starbucks please fix this!! What happened to you?!"}
{"text":"Drive-thru: Depends on the day or who's working. Some baristas are amazing and have their game on point but if you're unlucky, you'll get this other group of people who just stand around and chat amongst themselves despite the long line, or they're super slow and don't know how to prioritize, especially during the morning rush. I blame poor management on this. 

Because half of the staff is amazing and not so much the other half I give this place a 3.

Update: just waited almost 15 mins for a black coffee at the drive thru during morning traffic rush."}
{"text":"I've been a customer at this Starbucks location for a very long time now... and have sunk a great deal of my paycheque into it, being that I work across the street, may have something to do for it.

Usually I'll get my morning coffee before work, depending on what I choose being the Americano for about $3.80 or so, up to sometimes my very customized mocha beverage which on some days runs anywhere from $5.95 to $8.40 (yes sometimes I do spend that) 

During the morning, I can always count on my drink to be exactly how I like it, and its practically perfect (Shout out to Taylor the amazing Barista there early mornings) ... but that being said.. sometimes at lunch if I go, or after work in the evening, well... lets just say that the quality of the drinks is completely lackluster.

Not enough espresso or syrups, I got a mocha frap one time and it was literally like drinking milk foam..  I don't usually complain, because they are a good bunch of folks there who really get to know you by name etc. Which makes you feel special, knowing that you will always get asked how you are, how your weekend was, its just a nice feeling and makes you enjoy going in. 

I have noticed a sort of turnover in staff over the past months, so not sure if they are just trying to be fast and sacrificing quality... but I'm sure I'm not the only one who noticed.  But if you go in the morning, you will always get exactly what you want and need.

They are terrific there, and as long as I work downtown, they'll have me and many others, loyal to the store, as customers."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of starbucks coffee but we needed a break from our hotel coffee and just happened to stop by here. The service was very impressive and probably deserving of 5 stars but like I said before, not a fan of starbucks so the best they get from me is a 4."}
{"text":"I was locked out of my cousins house and needed a place to hang out till they get home. This place had a great atmosphere, very friendly and engaging baristas. Ordered soy mocha, chocolate milk for the kids and a slice of double chocolate loaf that went down the hatch in seconds... it was muy bueno. There were two washrooms but there was always a line to go in. Waited fifteen minutes before I could change the baby's diaper."}
{"text":"Barista did not mix the matcha in my matcha tea latte well. It was clumpy and I don't get how they think is okay to serve that to your customer. Wait times are long to be served. Wrote a complaint to the company and got a reimbursement. Same situation happened to my cousins. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"I love the setting at this Starbucks. It's a very relaxing area. I'm just sipping my on my chai latte, watching people walk, wander and shop right now."}
{"text":"I LOVE this Starbucks!! The employees are the best. It's a little smaller than most, but you can also use this to your advantage. For a place to study, it's pretty intimate, which also makes it ideal as a place for a study group (minus the lack of seating areas). Plus, it's in the Southern Highlands area, so super classy neighborhood all the way around. :)"}
{"text":"I really liked this Starbucks. I only went to study but they also have a drive-thru. Also, they had a couple of tables to study but I feel like they need more. Overall it was pretty cool though. I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"This location is central at Chinook and the staff moves the line quickly. 

Pricing is same as other locations of course and the staff are super friendly. 

Not much selection of mugs and coffee beans but decent. 

Only a small bar area to sit so you will need to find elsewhere to sit to enjoy a Pike. 

It's Starbucks and a consistent experience here."}
{"text":"Starbucks phone customer service is horrific which is surprising considering how good it is at the local level"}
{"text":"Staff are super friendly here. I have never had a bad experience here. 
Food is always prepared as asked, they accommodate almost everything, even my lactose free milk!"}
{"text":"The coffee is always hot and the staff is super friendly...especially when handing out LOTS of freebies on #MyGeneration 50+ Sr. Wednesdays."}
{"text":"This has to be the slowest Starbucks around.  Employees are rude, and screw your orders up.  Don't train employees in the drive through in the morning when people are trying to grab a quick coffee before work."}
{"text":"Had bought coffee beans here. I asked for grounded for French press. When I got home to open the bag. It was grounded very fine. The staff here don't care about your order."}
{"text":"Worst customer service!!!  Because THEY messed up on my order in the drive thru, they made me park the car and stand in line that had 6 people in it just to get my drink. I thought the whole idea of using the drive-thru was not to get out of your car?!?!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience when I come to my neighborhood Starbucks!! Everyone is always so friendly even when it is super chaotic! And there is never a very long wait time!"}
{"text":"If you want your coffee fast, this location is pretty good. They get you in and out pretty fast. Overall, Starbucks coffee is pretty good. I take it black to get the full experience of the coffee, and it is not that bitter. This location has plenty of seating and a food court is close.
If you like having coffee with lunch, then you can grab a drink here and your food elsewhere. This is a prime location, so it will always have a line, but you get through the line pretty quick."}
{"text":"Seriously, they deserve 0 stars. There isn't a worse Starbucks in Las Vegas. They routinely mess up my order, have no idea how to work efficiently and fall short of customer service every time. Today's experience was no better. Thought I might get out without a hassle and then I watched the barrister take my food out of the oven and just place it on the back counter as she went about her next thought. She tossed it to me without a fork at my eventual request. Take the time and go across the street. The other Starbucks on Maryland is one of the best."}
{"text":"Yes, another Starbucks review. Like previously stated I'm the coffee snob of Yelp!

I've visited this Starbucks a few times and haven't had any issues at all. The first time I went in and grabbed my usual coffee and headed out. This time I stayed a bit. I've gotta give credit to the staff, some customers are just rude! But, they kept their cool and handled it like it should have been handled.  

I was there for about 45 minutes. I like to people watch and drink my coffee. The place was packed. But, it was clean and there was always someone cleaning something. The staff was friendly. Even when the grumpy customers were not. 

I'd recommend this place. If nothing, its a great place to grab a coffee and people watch for a few minutes."}
{"text":"They saved my insides from freezing while braving the negative temps and snow. Although being from Texas I seemed to handle the cold better than my peers from the northern states. Super friendly group of people working here. As busy as they are during prime times of the day they have a good process to get people in and out as quickly as possible. 

Don't expect 2-3 minutes  in and out during rush hour coffee times - it takes a bit longer but when the line is going to the door and stacked 10-15 deep I am delighted it takes less than 10 minutes. I don't see that often here in Austin."}
{"text":"Slowest starbucks ever. There are 5 people waiting in line, yet the barista at the register is chatting with everyone and grinding coffee. The other barista seems competent."}
{"text":"This Starbucks location is alright. It's better than the usual Starbucks; and the employees actually seemed to care whether I was satisfied or not. 

My drink took a little while but it tasted good. This place was clean and so was their bathroom."}
{"text":"Great Starbucks. Always consistent drinks. The employees here handle an amazing amount of high volume with a lot of efficiency and grace. I have been stopping here probably 3-4 times a week for the last year. Great job everyone!"}
{"text":"No queues unless you're coming in during the morning/afternoon/evening rush hours...pleasant servers too..."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a vegan freindly coffee I highly recommend the hazelnut coconut milk macchiato! So yummy!"}
{"text":"Service is hit or miss and the the wifi is slow (when it works). I've been to this location about 10 times b/c it's close my house. The drive through line is always long which really hinders the service on the inside. I think the lackluster service is a product of the overburdened drive-through, which is unfortunate. The redeeming qualities of this place are the location, new remodel, and fact that it is a Starbucks (you know what you're getting)."}
{"text":"I'm surprised at the number of poor reviews on this location so I hope I'm on the right Starbucks. 

This is my go-to study spot as it's super close to home and Chapters/Indigo is one of my favourite stores. I've been here at a variety of times, and it does get busy sometimes, but I rarely have trouble finding a table. It's a lot less busy now that school has started, and in my opinion this location is quite spacious.

I do make sure to come with my devices fully charged, as there's only about two tables within reach of an outlet. They have recently added a power strip, so people seated at the long table can also charge up. 

I've never experienced long wait times, even with mobile orders (my go-to is a caramel macchiato). The staff are always super friendly, and I will definitely be spending a lot of time here this fall."}
{"text":"To be honest, I don't visit Starbucks very often. A lot of the reason why is, whenever I order a drink, it's usually not made well. I have had experiences with burnt coffee, unshaken green tea lattes (which basically amounts to me drinking lumps of matcha powder), drinks that are too sweet, and drinks that just flat out don't taste right. This particular Starbucks has done that a few times to me. The biggest turn off of me about this location, however, is the parking lot and drive-thru. It's an absolute mess. I can't tell you how many almost accidents I've seen in this lot. It's ridiculous. 

Aside from that, I really do enjoy their staff, I think they're nice people and they're always in chipper moods, which is why I give them 3 stars. The decor and ambiance of this location is nice and would be a decent place to come to work or study, as long as it isn't in the morning amidst the caffeine-deprived, working class on their way to their jobs. I can't vouch for the food at this location, nor at any Starbucks, really... but if that ever changes, I'll update!"}
{"text":"As far as Starbucks go, this one sucks. I went in and placed a coffee order. The bearded idiot behind the counter proceeds to tell me what they don't have instead of telling me they can just go ahead and brew the coffee I'm asking for, which is decaf. A coffee business that has no decaf coffee available is like an ice cream shop without vanilla ice cream. Went to NY West Bakery and had my coffee and a muffin. Beats the dried out, crappy bakery products Starbucks try's to pass off."}
{"text":"This is one of my preferred Starbucks. Primarily because the staff are friendly, it's wheelchair accessible, and there's an ample amount of parking. It's generally clean and there is lots of seating."}
{"text":"The first hot day of 2016 brought me to this location. Friendly staff. Comfortable atmosphere and quick service. Met my expectations for someone who needed to cool off fast. Nothing negative to say. Will definitely return in the future!"}
{"text":"The Misto is so delicious! Adam is the best!! Thanks to Adam & Belle for such great service and for starting our mornings out right!!"}
{"text":"Good Starbucks. Friendly staff. Very clean. Pastry case filled.

My drink came quick and correct. 

Only comment is that it's a fairly small store with all small tables. So larger groups cannot sit together."}
{"text":"Seriously, if you can avoid this starbucks, PLEASE DO.  The slowest baristas that I have ever experienced.  Manager took my order, walked away halfway through me talking.  Needless to say my order was wrong.  They fixed it, after some back and forth crap about whether that was what I ordered.  It was corrected, after another 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Either this is a training center for baristas, or this is the worst Starbucks on the planet. Never the same people working and I have been coming here for almost a year. Because it's close. And I'm lazy. And I need my coffee. So I wait the extra time, repeat my name over and over and drink my Starbucks. The coffee is consistent, the staff is not. Blah...."}
{"text":"Good location, but the problem is with U of T so close by, students occupy ton of the tables for themselves. Also, there aren't enough tables here. And there is always homeless people coming in asking for change which isn't the greatest experience.

I like the spot and the fact that it's newer, they just need to modify the actual space to allow for more seating. I did like the order station in the back with the bar to rest drinks on and make people line up. I also liked the multiple cream/milk stations helps get people out the door faster. 

Wifi is very fast. Flooring is all concrete so again emphasis on that extra seating to get off the concrete."}
{"text":"This is one of the best starbucks I've ever been to in Toronto. 

large, large location with a drive through AND plenty of seating inside and out. seriously having met up here this starbucks is perfect for the area and great for meetings or working. 

The extra size in the dining room means even if everyone has their apple laptop and writing their screen play or blog, you'll still find somewhere to stand or sit. 

you also have a huge patio to choose from as well as free parking. 

there also happens to be a loblaws across the way in the same plaza if you want to save on food options or grocery. 

drive through also nice and large so if you're taking the truck it's easy to navigate. fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"Is there such a thing as a subpar Starbucks?

Well, perhaps this one is it. This is a newer location which pushed out a local store, and I would say it's actually rather nicely appointed.  It's a space that gets a lot of light that looks both modern and comfortable.

Now, I'm not sure how the chain which is at the pinnacle of corporate homogeneity can fail this badly on the staff and service side, but 4 out of 5 visits here have had some sort of problem, namely:
--The staff can't work the cash register...significant delay involving all 3 employees.
--The staff member can't figure out how to work the Clover machine...wasn't there some training for this?
--My drink was completely forgotten.  Actually they made it and forgot to give it to me, but by the time I got someone's attention it had been sitting around a while.
--They're somehow out of the first two things I try to order, including the medium roast Pike's Place coffee...this just doesn't happen at Starbucks usually.

Now, most of the time in a Starbucks, I think they're taking some corporate dispensed Soma (cf. Brave New World), as they're sort of unreasonably happy and friendly to be serving grande lattes.  This location, however, has apparently not gotten their shipment in, and I've encountered some of the least happy staff I've ever seen.

They've been open 4 or 5 months...I would figure Starbucks has the new store process down cold, but this one is a definite miss.  Have no fear, you have alternatives to this mess:
1) Another Starbucks, just a half block away (you can actually see it).
2) 3 more Starbucks within a 5 minute walk.
3) Golden Min: a cute little local shop that does excellent coffee on the corner of Yonge & College."}
{"text":"Friendly baristas, however, frequently under staffed. So don't expect to be in and out, they are not quick."}
{"text":"Over the several years I've been a customer at this location intermittently, the different baristas are always engaging and friendly. And there are enough of them - if you've seen my review/complaint about the west side location you know understaffing is a pet peeve!

-Landlocked. Little parking. Take your chances on parking in front of Radio Shack/yoga studio next door depending on top of day.
-Two ways into the drive thru, the back way of which allows some folks to skip the (long) line that is on University (at peak morning rush)."}
{"text":"Great new location! Large seating area and nice outdoor patio in the warmer months. Friendly staff and my drinks are always made correctly."}
{"text":"Unfriendly and frustrating. Mobile order service is extremely slow for this location, which is so disappointing since this Starbucks is the closest to my house. Not only is the service slow, almost half  the time the staff makes the incorrect drink or somehow screws up my order. The only reason I gave one extra star was for the 2-3 employees who actually smile and try to make this place better."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my time at this location, there were enough tables (don't know how it was before but heard they have renovated not too long ago so now it's pretty spacious), the staffs were pleasant, drinks came out pretty quickly. The only downfall is that the air conditioner was blasting in store, it was so freezing. They're easy to find as well, just a minute walk from the Eglinton station. Would visit again!"}
{"text":"Messed up my order TWO TIMES, extremely slow service. Bad attitude from barista. Not impressed at all"}
{"text":"Welcome to classy town everyone! 

This location is brand-spanking new TODAY! 

It is the nicest Starbucks I have ever been in. They've transformed an old TD Canada Trust location and classed up the joint beyond their normal cozy atmosphere. 

There's chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, granite tables, and the condiment station is a vintage buffet with a granite top. On one side of the coffee shop they have a larger table which is flanked by two old doors, making this look more like a dining hall than a coffee shop. 

With this location being so close to home, this could get dangerous for my wallet."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have issues at this location. They moved to a better location but I guess everyone quit or something. The service is horrible. They never have lemon pound cake and our drinks are always subpar. Do yourself a favor drive to the next one or maybe it's time to switch to Dutch Bro's. Their service is pretty amazing and like their coffee too."}
{"text":"Very good Starbucks. 

What can I add?

1. Great location on Front Street between Union Station and the Toronto Convention Centre. Convenient to the Fairmont and Intercontinental Hotels.

2. Room to sit here. You might battle a pre-work crowd, yet if you need a place to sit and work or meet a friend/client for coffee, you can do it here without too much pandemonium.  There will be others, for sure, yet you can usually find a spot."}
{"text":"The coffee's the same as other Starbucks'. Locations is good, lots of parking spots. BUUUUUUT, the stuff is freaking LOUD! Been here for 20 minutes and I couldnt focus on anything, they just yell and laugh, covering the nice music thats playing...mmmyeah, not my location"}
{"text":"Eh...they don't listen and they are too chatty with everyone.  Went through the drive-thru and ordered a Black Eye (two shots in a cup of coffee) with Cream and Two raw sugars and got a Red Eye (one shot in a cupt of coffee).  Sent it back for the extra shot -- I needed my caffiene boost and when the guy came back with the cup his mouth was still moving.  I left without checking and when I tasted realized I had a Black-Eye straight up.  Not that I disliked it, but I was tasting the cream and sugar.  Too much chatty...not enough workie."}
{"text":"Great customer service just really freaking slow and the employees were taking their sweet time."}
{"text":"Went to the Starbucks at the Forum area at Caesars. Horrible customer service. 
Disappointed to not get consistent experience across different starbucks."}
{"text":"I always come to this Starbucks but I just want to say they can improve on the service. A LOT. I ordered through mobile and had to wait a LONG TIME before receiving my orders. If I just walked in and ordered I would've gotten my food and drink made a lot faster. In fact, a couple got in before me and left before me and I had ordered through mobile way before I got to the store. Also the girl making my drink forgot my breakfast sandwich in the oven too long, I heard it beeping for awhile, and another girl had to take it out for her because she was too busy making drinks. She poured a little bit of whole milk first before even reading the customized cup (I ordered soy milk) and didn't even bother changing the cup to a new one & she mixed my frapp with a blender that clearly said \"dairy\" on it. I'm not an expert, but I know that Soy is not dairy. Anyways, I still go to this location even though the service is garbage since it's the closest one in my area. Bad luck for me haha. I still love Starbucks though..."}
{"text":"This location is literally the slowest Starbucks ever if you have 30 minutes to grab coffee to go , JOIN US !!!! I will post a picture of how full the coffee was , spilling all over as she handed it to me , spilled allllll over me and the car instantly !!!!!"}
{"text":"It's your normal great service starbucks, but just of the storied lobby of the william penn hotel."}
{"text":"Normal Starbuck's store.  The barista was efficient, the order was taken promptly, and the wifi for my iPhone was quite convenient after being in a back country area where there was no coverage."}
{"text":"After the Great Santa Run, I needed a quick fix of caffeine.  I was on my way downtown to see a play at Theatre7, so this was a good stop.  The staff was pleasant albeit not quite with it.  After charging me for the gingerbread loaf I wanted, they discovered they were out of it.  Asking for a refund on my Starbucks card seemed out of the question, so I got a replacement.

The drink was good and I was on my way after checking some email and FB posts."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great coffee... The only drawback is even when it is slow there is always a wait for coffee. Other than that if you have a couple extra minutes stop in for a great cup of coffee of three..."}
{"text":"I was in the area and needed some caffeine.  The baristas were friendly and quick, and I was on my way in a short time.  There's  not a whole lot more to say."}
{"text":"Yay for the coffee and service but thumbs down on their parking situation.  At times, the line for the drive thru curls through the very small parking lot making entry and exit sometimes impossible for those going into the store.  They do now have three 10 minute only spots that are closer to the road for those people like myself who tend just to pop in.  Their placement makes it a tad easier to deal with the parking nightmare that is bound to happen in the morning."}
{"text":"My favorite Starbucks location. They always have the drinks I order and the staff is SO nice and friendly. It doesn't hurt that it is also located in the Target :). The customer service is so phenomenal that even when I am near a closer Starbucks, I will drive over to this location."}
{"text":"Friendly staff!  The only drawback is if your going to sit outside, be prepared to smell Pizza Hut!  The drive through line is loooong."}
{"text":"The interior was recently renovated and I find the staff to be friendly and hard working, especially if they get to know you after a while. I don't know why anyone complains about this crew. And as some have said, at times it does get very busy, with the drive thru line being like a mile long. Aside from that, no issues. If you like Starbucks drinks and food, that's exactly what you'll get here."}
{"text":"A simple I'll be with you in a minute goes so far, Rather than leaving someone thinking they must be invisible- terrible customer service at the drive through"}
{"text":"Worst Starbucks in America. They manage to get my order wrong or have me wait over 10 minutes every single time I go here. Terrible, terrible, terrible. Avoid it."}
{"text":"I usually come here every morning on my way to work. The staff is friendly and when I go into the store it's always clean. The drive thru is 80% of the time very slow. I've waited 15 minutes for coffee stuck in the drive thru with a moderate/shorter line. I don't know what they do behind the scenes after you order, but they need to pick up the pace."}
{"text":"I like this Starbucks. Service is friendly. Cool place to hang out and of course my favorite extra hot latte!"}
{"text":"Belle ambiance  idéale pour déguster un bon breuvages  et lire un livre . Il y a  le réseau  Internet gratuit."}
{"text":"While waiting for our table to be called at Green Valley Ranch restaurant inside of the casino we decided the couches here were more than inviting so decided to sit and rest in comfort. We decided to go with a drink that will not take our appetites, so decided on chai tea latte.

The customer service here was great and very laid back. I was exciting to sit and relax in the comfy inviting couches and enjoy my cell phone game and tea. It was highly relaxing too. The ambiance of this location is so chilled and quiet. Perfect for cell phone caught up and chai tea."}
{"text":"In by out and about I happened to drop into this Starbucks and needed that little lift of caffeine to make it through the rest of the day. This store I believe sees a lot of tourist traffic since they have so much Las Vegas merchandise. But that's ok since I am slurping and rescuing a Vegas coffee cup so that I can have a fabulous look to my coffee every morning. 

I ended up ordering a Carmel macchiato, it seems to be my go to drink. It was made just the way I like it. The coffee floating on top of the milk, and whip cream and Carmel on top. It makes it extra special for me."}
{"text":"I've been to this Starbucks about 100000000 times and every time I get great customer service. I appreciate this Starbucks location for their mannerism and how efficient they are. I always feel so welcomed here. Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"Jazz playlist is top notch. 

There are plenty of seats and plugs, with a variety of large and small tables. I like how the layout puts a wall between the workspace and the brew station so the toaster is somewhat muffled. 

I love the art work. A special shoutout to whoever made the crochet art and made the chalkboard art. You've got a talent ! 

Four out of five stars because last time I came here it was so busy I couldn't even park and the drive thru line was out to the street, but now that I'm in with a seat, I'm mad I didn't wait it out last time! I'll be here for awhile (:"}
{"text":"This location is such a nightmare to deal with that it's soured my opinion on the company as a whole. I understand that mornings are busier and make wait-times longer, but it's ridiculous that I consistently have to wait 20+mins and still come away without a drink because it's simply impossible to get through the line (regardless of length) in anything resembling a reasonable amount of time. Whenever I give this location another chance, I leave empty handed and late for work."}
{"text":"I am happy to report improvements at this 'Bucks. I no longer encounter unfriendly baristas and wait times are shorter (but still longer than other nearby locations). 

The issues I have encountered recently at this location are consistency and availability.

I've had orders gotten completely wrong, ordering and paying for a venti and getting a grande... I've also gotten incorrect food. These issues are corrected without any struggle but when time is of the essence it can be frustrating.

This location also seems to be out of the necessary ingredients to make certain seasonal drinks more often than others in the area. 

I now feel like I can hit the drive thru of this Starbucks when I have some spare time on the way to work without too much concern about being late, but still hope to see more positive changes here."}
{"text":"Lately I've been having an issue with baristas at Starbucks not putting my agave nectar in my latte saying its a \"health code violation\" how is that possible? Well, guess what? I just called corporate and your wrong! The district managers have been notified but they have not done anything a year has passed and still arguing with me the manager said this is her rule not Starbucks. This is not a Starbucks rule you don't own Starbucks you can't make up your own rules 
What happened to hospitality and just say yes!?"}
{"text":"I have never in my life have had such terrible customer service from here from a barista named Dan. The aftermath of Mcdonalds is better than the way this employee treats customers. My female friend did not know what she wanted when we got to the front of the line, so the barista Dan rudely told us \"Go to the side because I have other customers that I need to serve\". When a female barista came to help us, there was a misunderstanding with my friend about the \"starbucks points\", which the female barista was kindly trying to explain to her. After a while my male friend asked if he can pay for the drink because the conversation was taking a while which the female barista kindly said \"no, let me explain\". Eventually we were getting aggravated, as were other customers in line, because the conversation was dragging on and the three of us got the point of how \"starpoints\" work. Of course the barista Dan comes in and says \"You are being destructive. You need to either order or get out of the store\", which upset one of my male friends whom told him \"Don't talk to her that way, we ordered, we have been trying to pay for our drink for five minutes\". Of course this male barista proceeds to get rude and says \"well if you want to make a complaint GO AHEAD ILL GIVE YOU MY MANAGERS CARD and you can complain\" which made us question the managing of the place as well, and continued to say that when my male friend said \"Listen, we just want our drink, so either give us the drink that we paid for or give us our money back because you're being really rude and threatening to kick us out when we've asked to pay for the drink repeatedly and we did. Our friend wanted to know about the starpoints which she was confused. So give me my money back if thats how you are going to treat my friend\". 

DAN was very RUDE. and very UNPLEASANT.

To top things off, he stated \"I have got one of my coworkers to call the police on you three if you dont get out of this shop\" which we left because we believed this UNNECESSARY situation that your EMPLOYEE caused FOR YOUR PAYING CUSTOMERS was getting out of hand. 

I have told my friends about the incident who are regular customers, and they do not ever plan on coming back to this location. I am disgusted. I question the management at this location based on the way your employee had treated us as customers.

If your employees did not call the police, in which they had NO reason to to begin with because it was over my friend being confused about the starbucks points, I would have left the situation alone and not come back. I am calling the head company and making the complaint in hopes they do something with such a terrible employee. Very rude from the beginning, to the very end when he wasn't even serving us. I am not happy with this service and I am never coming back.."}
{"text":"This place is one of the worst Starbucks locations.  There is always a long wait, and a big reason is because they always get orders wrong.  Today we ordered an iced coffee and cream and got a pumpkin spice latte.   2 cars in front of us also had to return their drinks.

This location needs major improvements."}
{"text":"The only thing this location can get a star for is the fact they are actually a Starbucks and serve Starbucks products. Even then, they sometimes don't get that right. Service is painfully slow, friendliness is hit or miss, same with accuracy of order. Please, Starbucks, find someone who runs a great location and move them here. Or, open another Starbucks between my home and work. Most of the time now I just go to Perk Up in Southern Highlands, but sometimes you just need a Starbucks. (PS, Perk Up is not fast, but faster, and they have the best Chai on the planet. Friendliness is always above board. It's my favorite absent a quality Starbucks.)"}
{"text":"I'm usually a very generous rater, but as a prior Starbucks worker how you can you totally forget a customers order while there standing there waiting? Yes I get it, there's a drive thru as well with orders but not once did the barista even look up and ask me if I was waiting on anything while they were talking story with there coworkers. But I got a store credit of $4, thanks to one of the baristas (thank you!) I would come back again, but I just hope this doesn't happen again or to anybody else."}
{"text":"Square one Starbucks (food court) has got to be one of the most efficient spots I've seem. With a staff of 5-7 squished on a cramped space they work within their zones and does it well. They tackle their crazy lineups with a smile and pumped out drinks like there is no tomorrow. And they do it with a smile.

Their pumpkin spice latte is always a hit during the holidays. But what I rave about this store are their brownies. It's moist and delicious and rich. The portion is also big enough that I don't require more. Saves me money on spending for more food.

My his Starbucks will always be a hit, hence the long lineups. But once you are there, pick up a brownie, latte and receive a free smile and a tummy party."}
{"text":"This review its dated: 1.4.15
I decided to order a smoothie instead of a coffee this time to try it out. That was a bad idea. First off the guy at the bar asked one of the other workers how tho make it, I ordered the Orange and mango, it tasted like straight whey protein and water no flavor at all. I Will stick to my coffee from now on."}
{"text":"Super fast & SUPER FRIENDLY service!! Fastest drive thru Starbucks I have EVER been to. Got their Pumpkin Cream Cheese Muffin & a Pumpkin Spiced Frappuccino...cuz, ya know, FALL And both were extremely delicious...especially that muffin! Wow! Overall AMAZING Starbucks run!"}
{"text":"Always friendly and quick. I'm in and out within minutes no matter how crowded or time of day. They help find me vegan options and are always willing to alter my drinks. Whoo!"}
{"text":"I decided to bring my family to Starbucks We ordered 30 dollars worth of drinks, when I asked for a tray, they just told me that there wasn't any left. They weren't apologetic, sympathetic, nor did they show empathy or concern.  They suggested I use a bag, what a recommendation for 6 drinks. Starbucks claims to an exceptional customer service based coffee shop which is why you charge almost double your competition. Yet your establishment does not provide its customers with carry out trays. There were 5 staff there, and not one of the staff were apologetic nor had any common sense until I made a fuss about it. Not what I would call great customer service."}
{"text":"This location used to house a TD bank branch. You can still see the former bank vault in the space when visiting Starbucks - sorry to report no money in there - as well as the original private meeting room! 

They store is always nice and clean, they have plenty of seating area, and above all the staff are very friendly and courteous. Not something you will find at any coffee shop, and especially FEMA across the street (FAEMA; send your staff to be trained here, pronto!)."}
{"text":"I bring my disabled daughter here all the time. The staff go above and beyond to accommodate her. They always bring her order right to the table.
Easy access by subway and one handicapped parking spot."}
{"text":"Despite the hustle & bustle of a prime student location, this Starbucks manages to serve their clientele very efficiently and without error. They don't show any contempt when people place those complicated orders during the rush and the staff have always been smiling!"}
{"text":"This place is mediocre, sad to see corporate let a location sink so low. To be fair it's management and their training standards. If you want a sloppy cup of coffee this is the place to come, they make the drinks blindfolded here and just hand them out to move their line. Next time I need Starbucks I'll just head over to another location or Dutch Bros."}
{"text":"Great service, reliable, consistent coffee the same every time. This specific location reminds me of when I lived in New York City, love the cool café vibe and sweet jazzy tunes playing above."}
{"text":"The most convenient Starbucks, but unfortunately, management needs to spend more time with their employees. Got my name name wrong after spelling out (MARTIN is not a difficult name to spell), asked for several pastries and got served one, and apparently a caramel macchiato doesn't have caramel at this location. On a positive note, I got a beautiful smile from one of the beautiful girls working there, which is the reason for the one star."}
{"text":"I have been to this place numerous times with my service dog and every time I have been told he cannot be there and it is until I show them his card that they believe me...which I guess is fine considering that is their policy. However this last time I went it was beyond harassment. The manager asked to see his card and gladly i showed her. When I was waiting for my drink the male barrista said to me that my dog cannot be in there...so once again I explained the manager already asked to see his card and I had already showed her. So I left with my drinks. It wasnt until i was down the block when I hear this man yelling for me to stop demanding me to show him the paperwork and that the manager wanted him to ask AGAIN!  This has honestly gone too far. Not only am I humiliated at this point that they do not believe he is a service dog but insulted and astonished someone would be so rude.

I will never be going to this Starbucks again."}
{"text":"So excited pumpkin spiced chai is back! This location is kinda in the hood but the staff are super sweet and helpful. They make my drink just like I like two pumps of sweetener. The bathrooms are really clean too!"}
{"text":"Waited in line for 30 mins.  They told me they don't do refills here.  What????  Where's the sign for that?  Thanks Starbucks!"}
{"text":"Poor service.  They did not even accept my Starbucks card. And it costs more than the newly opened Starbucks in the Forum shops first floor near the spiral staircase."}
{"text":"This Starbucks is nearly always packed. My biggest complaint with this Starbucks is that they mess up orders enough times for it to seem like a pattern. The baristas are friendly but maybe need to focus more on the task at hand."}
{"text":"I simply love this place. It is like a home away from home for me. The barristas are super friendly and a pleasure to be around. Love it!"}
{"text":"They will mess up your drive thru order. Just don't do it... go inside. Used to come here a lot because they are conveniently close, but every time they mess up simple orders or just plain ruin the drink. Walk in is the only way to go here. Do not use the drive thru unless you want to walk in to get your order fixed."}
{"text":"They really need to get more people at this location. Drinks take forever! Not to mention the drive thru line is horrible! They do get a ton of business and are always packed but honestly I think it's because the location is convenient and only one in southern highlands. If they can just get more people and better trained I think it would be nice."}
{"text":"Went to your business on Black Friday at 7:45 pm and was denied service despite the fact that your business was supposed to be open until 9 pm as advertised.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Although I am a regular at a different location in Madison and does not make it to this location as often, this is my favorite store in the area.
This store has convenient hours, especially if you are an early bird as I am, this store is open as of 4.30am. Also it's drive thru is fast, of course rush hour is a little different but still I am always surprised how quick they are.
It's location is convenient if you work in the area and easy accessible. Their staff is friendly and has always a smile on their face."}
{"text":"This Starbucks provides the caffeine needed to get me through the day, and for that I am eternally grateful. The baristas here are for the most part super-friendly, always greeting me by name, asking what I've been up to after a few days out of town, and remembering my favourite drinks.

Aside from that, it's a Starbucks, and there isn't a whole lot to say. Drinks are consistently good, not great, and pastry offerings are average. Breakfast sandwiches and paninis are often sold out, which is somewhat annoying. Free Wi-Fi, decent amount of seating. The bathrooms are not well maintained, but that isn't Starbucks' fault as they're run by the building.

This Starbucks is somewhat odd in that it shares its seating area with a Charter One bank. This ordinarily isn't a problem, but as an undergrad at CWRU, I was once sitting here trying to study when the bank was robbed and a bunch of cops ran in with guns drawn..."}
{"text":"I love this Starbucks!  It's like being a contestant on a game show every time you order something!  Go thru the drive thru and you'll experience how fun it is!  My favorite woman is the one with wild blonde hard and sparkly eye shadow.  She's a riot!  The other employees are super friendly here too.  If you're in the neighborhood, this is the best Starbucks location."}
{"text":"What bad can be said of consistent coffee and tea beverages made by CJ, Kyle, Nikki, or any of the other SB crew? I love these guys. Always smiling, helpful, upbeat. 

The location is a good one, and although they are much bigger and busier than the older location, it's still SB, as aforementioned, constantly consistent, that well-oiled machine that just keeps producing that caffeine packed liquid goodness. I've tried so quit you caffeine, I've tried, but damn it, just can't quit you...."}
{"text":"This Starbucks is like an oasis on a hot summers day. The air cranked up to full blast feels amazing! However, oftentimes you can't stay to enjoy it as the seating is a bit limited. Twice I've popped by in late afternoon with no seats available. 

Service is okay, though a bit slow and the baristas at neighbouring Starbucks I find a bit more friendly. 

Not quite nearly as much traffic as the Young and College 'bucks, which is nice, but honestly, with Bulldog so close by I don't see myself coming back to this location very often."}
{"text":"I was skeptical about this location thinking that it was a \"We Proudly Brew\" kinda joint. However, I'm happy that a co-worker brought me here on Monday! I desperately needed some caffeine but didn't want to walk to Market Square to my typical Starbucks location. I ordered a Pumpkin Spice Latte, and it was perfect in taste and temperature. Plus, this location inside the Omni William Penn is positively gorgeous. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"You can't miss this location driving by it on Queen. It's 3 months old and the biggest Starbucks in Brampton by far. The have their own building and parking lot not to mention the fact that they have a drive through.

It has to be the first coffee shop or restaurant i have seen with power outlets (and usb) at every seat! The service and coffee was great too."}
{"text":"The worst customer service I've ever encountered. If you don't want to talk to people, confirm orders or be polite you are in the wrong business! Every time we come to this drive thru it's always to someone who doesn't want to have a job. The orders are always wrong and forget asking for a correction. The girl today actually said 'Bye' and walked away from the window when I tried to confirm that my 5yr olds coffee had no caffeine as the rest of the order was incorrect."}
{"text":"I've come to this location several times and they're always friendly and do a great job.

I've been through the drive through a few times but usually come in and sit down with my friend. I like this location because it's a convenient for my friend and I to meet up and we love the speedy service.

The only downside of this location is that it closes at 7pm most days, which is a little too early for my taste. This usually causes me to have to drive all the way to the sandhill location because they are open till 9pm. In a nutshell this location gets the job done and I dig it! 

Keep up the good job Starbucks of East Flamingo!!!"}
{"text":"This store has some of the nicest baristas ever! They are quick and accurate as well!"}
{"text":"I'm only writing this review because I'm concerned about serious health risks with the dairy products.

I went inside this location with some friends on a Sunday night as the drive-thru was really busy.  There were about four employees working at the time and they were running around like chickens with their heads cut off.  The store seriously needs to employ more staff.  Anyway, someone ahead of us ordered a milkshake type beverage that contained whipped cream on top. 

This is what I witnessed from an employee:

- went into the fridge and put whipped cream on top of beverage
- scraped it off
- went back to the fridge and put whipped cream on again
- scraped it off again
- went back to the fridge and put whipped cream on again
- scraped it off again
- in frustration, said, \"why are all these curdling?\"
- went back to fridge and put whipped cream on again but this time successfully

WHY DID YOU NOT PREPARE THE CUSTOMER ANOTHER BEVERAGE AFTER THE FIRST ONE WAS HIT WITH CURDLED CREAM?  SCRAPING IT OFF WILL NOT MAKE IT RIGHT!

I feel horrible that I was unable to warn the customer but he/she was somewhere in the drive-thru.  Obviously he/she either got food poisoning or a bad stomach ache."}
{"text":"This Starbucks is the same all the others in Las Vegas, So I'll make this Short and Sweet! 

Located in the Smith's Shopping Center of Southern Highlands, Next to Pizza Hut and, Walgreens. The Parking on this side is no Problem...The Drive Thru can be a Hassle at times, I've come at Different times of day, and the busiest seems to be when school lets out. All the High Schoolers come here to hang out, or do their homework, so it does get crowded. 

Customer Service...Pretty Good!
Getting My Drink...Fast & Efficient
My Name on the Drink...Haha, well Its ALWAYS Wrong!

Nothing New to say here...Just Be Aware of the High Schoolers! lol"}
{"text":"Wanted some good ol starbucks coffee and the cashier kept sneezing and rubbing her nose. She never went to wash her hands!! Grabbed some canned drinks and used my phone bar code so she didn't touch anything."}
{"text":"Today is 2nd day of new store in Caesars palace. Customer service great but they ran out of Trenta size cups. They also did not have any of the new Fizio drinks for lack carbonation. The store is nice and spacious clearly anticipating larger crowds. Nice bar stool area so you can look out into casino. Store had potential but was lacking today for minor stuff only."}
{"text":"They always make my order right and i barely have to wait great service and friendly people here will be back again and again and again."}
{"text":"I'm a regular customer here and I don't think I've ever had a negative experience. The baristas are friendly, they rarely make a mistake with the crazy drinks I get and if they do, they always make it right. Most of the staff here have been here quite a while (John/Graham/Mandy) and they try to remember your name and drink so it's usually a pretty quick transaction. This location is always busy between children, SAHMs and the random folk on Bloor. When they aren't busy, some of the baristas will chat with you a bit. Pleasant experience and wonderful, competent staff."}
{"text":"This place is conveniently located in Caesar's Palace Food Court near Forum Shops. While the cashier and barista were nice and kind, it took about 5 minutes to process one person' simple order. The small (tall) horchata frappacino, coffee cake, bacon, egg and Gouda cheese sandwich came out to be $18.94, which is much more expensive than what I usually pay in NYC."}
{"text":"Great staff here. Always quick and friendly despite how busy they are. My go to Starbucks."}
{"text":"This Starbucks is close to my house which makes it easy for me to get my Green Tea Latte fix every so often! 


Pros:
- Service: Drive thru here is great! I love that I can drive early in the morning. All of the servers I've come across are so nice, even through the drive thru. The drive thru is super quick and I'm never waiting for to long. 
- Drinks: Drinks here are consistent and I never feel like I'm getting one drink one day and another the next, which makes me happy! 
- Seating: Lots of seating as well as tables with outlets for those who want to bring their laptops and chargers. There is no seating limit (that I am aware of) and you never feel like the servers are staring you down to leave. I usually come here to study and read if I have the chance. 
- Parking: At the front of the building, it doesn't seem like there is a lot of parking, but drive to the back and there are tons of spaces! 
- Wifi: Wifi is always fast!
- Cleanliness: The store itself is very tidy (including the washrooms). 

Drinks/Foods I like:
- Cake pops: The birthday cake pop is my weakness! 
- Green Tea Latte with Soy Milk
- Caramel Macchiato with Soy Milk and Extra shot of espresso 

Overall, I don't have any complaints about this location! So glad this is open close to my house so I can come by when I can."}
{"text":"Perhaps the dirtiest Starbucks I've ever been to! The floor was sticky and trash everywhere, bathroom was worse, trash bin overflowing.  Totally mismanaged!"}
{"text":"This location has a drive-thru (handy!) but it's also a pain to get into if you're not already on that side of the road (not so handy). I've only ever been through the drive-thru here, though, so it's clearly not a dealbreaker. 

My interactions with staff have been just fine; there have been waits in the drive-thru but that's just the nature of a froofy drink place where people tend to customize. On my last visit I was one of those people; the s'mores Frappucino sounded amazing but I can't have caffeine. I asked if it was possible to get it as a Creme and it was. Unfortunately, it was super sweet and didn't have much a flavor beyond that quality. The bitterness of coffee would have helped greatly, but I can't fault them - they accommodated my request for a caffeine-free version. 

Starbucks devotees are likely glad there's a location near Hilldale, but as a casual visitor it's not usually worth the hassle of getting in and out."}
{"text":"The remodel on this Starbucks is completely sterile and uncomfortable. The place is messy with un-wiped tables. 

The barista seemed completely out out when I asked for real \"for-here\" cups. She actually threw out the paper cups she was holding. No cream on the counter - had to ask for it and pour it out of a gallon carton. 

Seems truck stop than a Starbucks."}
{"text":"I had to come into this Starbucks to get a replacement for a drink that was made at a different location. Because the original drink I had , I had Asked for 4shots in a venti Carmel macchiato and it looked like milk with Carmel in it, there was no way it had coffee inside. So I went into this store and they were able to make me a whole new one without any fuss and it was perfect. Thank you for keeping me caffeinated!"}
{"text":"This isn't your typical Starbucks Smarbucks!
This location is probably the best, most magical one that I've ever been to.

I've never had an issue with a drink made here, the staff is UNBELIEVABLY, OVER-THE-TOP FRIENDLY, and there is always ample table space to work or catch up with friends.

It is seriously an amazing location to walk in to. Not only is this a great location to go to in and of itself, but it is located in the Westin in downtown Pittsburgh. Maybe it's the fact that it's technically part of the hotel, or maybe they're just amazing.

Just a note -- even though this location takes the Starbucks app to pay for beverages, they cannot redeem your star rewards -- so save those to another location!

If you're looking for a cup of coffee and in a rush (or not!), definitely take a moment to stop by this Starbucks!"}
{"text":"Ive never seen a Starbucks in a place that looks like a giant dining room in a house ... Def quaint and cozy, staff is very nice... And. I believe it's attached to a hotel..."}
{"text":"Of all the choices of Starbucks in the area, this is the only one I actively avoid if possible. There IS an outdoor seating area, which is nice in warmer months. Otherwise, I find this location to be less efficient than others, and I can't get over what seems like the smell of a dirty mop that is always lingering in the air here. Makes me wonder about the cleanliness of the rest of the place...

I'd recommend walking about a minute south to the next Starbucks if you've got the time."}
{"text":"Great location. Fair amount of seating, including outdoor during the summer, and they always have my mobile order ready before I arrive. 
Note that parking on the street can be harder to find during busy times, and don't risk illegally parking -- lots of enforcement in the area (which I don't disagree with!)."}
{"text":"why on earth would they list this as being in \"broadview heights\"?  it would be great if locals could actually access it.  This one is on the turnpike, for weary travelers.  The back entry gate is off e. edgerton but it is locked and you need to be a turnpike worker w/key card to get in.  So, unless you want to pay a toll and cruise the turnpike to get here....why on earth is this listed, like it's part of the \"neighborhood\" ?????  get real."}
{"text":"Usually I would not think of even giving be Starbucks a review but today I had such good customer service I had to write one  the young man Jon was so friendly and helpful he genuinely cared about my coffee  wow so nice seeing someone take pride in their work I will be go be to this Starbucks from now on"}
{"text":"My favorite are Ice Caramel macchiato & green tea frappucino but when I got a free reward, I ordered from their secret menu that I found on instagram.
The barista always made it for me and gave me a large size but Not in this location. It was my first time here.
My husband ordered a large coffee and I ordered from a secret menu . We felt the cashier was lied to us twice.

FIRST : I show one of a special drink to the cashier (it was franken frappuccino = green tea frappuccino+ java chip+ peppermint syrup+ white chocolate sauce+ top with whipped cream) and he said they did not have it because thats for special occasion. Even thou I was confused but I ended up just get the regular green tea frappuccino and he only gave me a medium size.

SECOND: After my husband got his coffee, he pour half & half from the counter but it was empty. He waited in front of the cashier (it was the same person who took our ordered) , The cashier looked at my husband and my husband said this half & half empty and the cashier said we are out of it. The cashier saw my husband confused so he said I'll take a look after with this customer. After the cashier done with the customer, he went to the fridge and grab the other half & half pot. 
If they were really out of half & half, how come he's not looking for it but grab the pot in the fridge right away and if they're out, at least he offered his customer other dairy like milk or something.
Poor service!!!"}
{"text":"From arrival to departure 34 minutes for two ice coffees.  I get that it's busy but you've got to be better prepared.  Did I mention I actually had to leave without my coffee?

Paid $6. Waited a half hour. Never got my coffee.

Not happy."}
{"text":"I was there a week ago, the barista was so nice and the location is so pretty!  I bought a bunch of drinks for clients and they got all of them correctly"}
{"text":"The service is good enough, a bit robotic and nothing special.  If you need a coffee come down, but the lounges and coffee shops that opened up as of lately, are a much better place to settle.  Music and in house made treats are my kinda place."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Starbucks as it 5 minutes from my home. I utilize the mobile order-ahead app and it makes all the difference.  You can make your drink to your specifications with one click and it will be ready and waiting for you by the time you arrive. I'm not going to lie. 9 times out of 10, I still go thru the drive-thru to pick up my drink instead of getting out of my car and walking into the store. Yes, I am that lazy and summers are too hot here in Vegas. I am always greeted by a smile from the barista. I always enjoy coming to this Starbucks."}
{"text":"This location is nice. The service is always fast & friendly. They've never messed up my drink nor has anyone stollen it. Lol. (It actually happens!) the seating is limited & always ready taken. It's a good ol' Starbucks location. If you need your fix you can get it here."}
{"text":"Die Filiale liegt direkt gegenüber vom Hotel The Linq. Leider gibt es im Hotel kein Frühstück, so dass man gezwungen ist sich selber was organisieren. 
Und irgendwie landet man dann doch hier. Starbucks ist ja grundsätzlich nicht bekannt für seine günstigen Preise. 

Aber hier lohnt es sich wirklich erst reinzugehen, wenn man vorher im Casino was gewonnen hat. 

Für einen großen Tee schlanke 4,50 $, ohne das ein Barista irgendwas zaubern musste. Respekt. 

Eine etwas dickere Scheibe Sand-oder Marmorkuchen 13,45$, Croissant 10,75$, Bagel mit Käse, Speck und Ei 15,95$!!!!
Danke mein Hunger ist dann doch nicht so groß. Ich suche weiter nach was günstigerem bzw. geht wieder an den Spieltisch und hoffe auf mein Glück."}
{"text":"I don't believe there is a worse Starbucks in the entire valley.  Their idea of service includes being rude, conning non English speakers,  unwillingness to remake an incorrectly made drink, and personal arrogance.  It's a shame it is a prime location with no competition, because this is one Starbucks that deserves to have it's employees fired or retrained.

Take the extra time to actually drive to ANY other coffee establishment (including any other Starbucks, like Horizon Ridge and Stephanie, Eastern and 215, or anywhere else )."}
{"text":"Surement pas le meilleur starbucks de la ville vu son emplacement sur la rue saint Denis avec tout le passage.
Le service est OK et le café comme dans tous les Starbucks."}

{"text":"Froid, peux acceuillant, semblable à tous les Starbucks du monde, mais en moins propre, je te conseille fortement de marcher deux trois minutes de plus et d'en trouver un plus accommodant, surtout si c'est pour boire ton café sur place !! 

Sinon, il est bien situé, les serveurs sont agréables ! 

Mais regarde autour, tu trouveras probablement un meilleur choix !! :)"}
{"text":"While it is a centrally located Starbucks with a drive through, it has some major issues beyond being just the norm. The drive through has yet to make my drink correctly, which is a pain. Due to the unfortunate proximity to the river, the bux gets a lot of vagrants in, so they've locked down most of the merchandise on the premise and it has a bit of a smell. The staff are pretty friendly (some are much, much better than others) and tend to get your drink right on the inside. It is actually a pretty spacious location and is nicely designed, but going here is like pulling teeth for me."}
{"text":"I mean should I really review another Starbucks? Well I suppose I should if I've typed this much so far.  It was fine as Starbucks goes; friendly smiles, similar degree of service as in the states, prompt order deliver.  Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Slowest damn Starbucks ever. And I get despirate for coffee that I still come here. Damn workers need to work faster or they need to hire more help"}
{"text":"I've have good and bad experiences here, but mostly bad.

They often make my drinks wrong, take longer than usual to make drinks, and one time they tried to pass off an old drink that was lying around as the drink I just ordered. I'm usually really forgiving with this stuff but when it happens regularly, I gotta take it into account.
I still always get what I order in the end but I wish I didn't have to go through all the things I talked about to get it."}
{"text":"Long waits and literally NEVER makes my order correctly the first time 
Hate that this is the closest sbux to me :("}
{"text":"Here's another review ! 
Apparently customer service is a thing of the past!? 

I wanted a salted Carmel mocha ! 
Mind you the drink just released this month . And they are out of the salt and toffee nut syrup !???? So my drink truly sucks this morning"}
{"text":"I go here almost everyday. I go through drive thru and order my earl grey and bagels. I have to say that all the staff working here are the most polite, friendly, considerate customer service representatives! I have never had an unpleasant experience and even one time when they messed up an order, a staff member ran out to my car while it was parked and gave me a $4 gift card! Give these employees a raise! They are doing an amazing job!"}
{"text":"Friendly, Welcoming, and fast.  
My only coffee stop for work, always the way I like it, I love the workers."}
{"text":"This location gets my order wrong 95% of the time. It's worth it to go across the parking lot and into Frys for that location."}
{"text":"This is one of a few Starbucks at Caesars conveniently located near the Augustus tower. Lineups can be long at peak periods of the morning and the price is a bit more than a regular Sbucks. Service when we had gone down for our morning coffee each day it was adequate. I'd get my double espresso extra foam with a muffin in the morning. I paid and had no issue with my Starbucks app. It's unfortunate pricing is higher than a normal Starbucks but hey, I guess this is standard for Vegas. 

+ Funny observation..... no one really talks much or smiles in line. It's get your morning java and get your day going! Could be because some had been up way too late or consumed waaay too much alcohol!"}
{"text":"Great smiles and greetings from the staff they offered new drink and I thought it to be just what I was looking for I would have given them 5 stars but for whatever reason it just doesn't seem open enough to comfortably hang and chill as I was hoping they would being a newer model and store ."}
{"text":"Watched it get a permit, watched it being constructed, watched it's grand opening, and am now sitting here, sipping hot coffee, surrounded by mostly senior citizens watching the traffic fly by on Grand. What's not to love? Xmas stockings are up, xmas blend is on tap, cams tree is up too. There's even cams stickers on the window. Happy Days.

Nearly forgot. Service is quick (considering its first thing Saturday AM), it's clean, the staff are chatty and audible, the products are as expected top quality and to order. I don't have one single gripe."}
{"text":"This location is painfully slow, regardless of what is ordered, how much is ordered or what time you arrive. I have been in there while it's empty and still had a long wait for green tea and a water. Inside doesn't appear to be well kept either. The tables always have trash on them or are sticky. The bathroom is usually dirty as well."}
{"text":"yep , its a starbucks. 
actually a dead starbucks. was able to walk right up to the counter. It is a nice place to get a drink and relax."}
{"text":"Painfully slow service. Been here several times over the last year. Won't come any more. I love Starbucks but I'll drive to a different one in the future. Management needs to redesign the staffing load. Inside service is over worked and under staffed at all times!"}
{"text":"I don't even know how they swiped the card so fast. 

We hit the drive through at a busy but not packed time. As in, a line in the parking lot but not out in the street.  I ordered our two thingies and when we got to the window the clerk took the card and handed it back with the drinks in like .2 seconds. I was impressed. 

During peak hours this place does way more business than the space can handle and you get a line of cars blocking one of the lanes on University, the city should get more tax money for that. Or maybe Starbucks could adopt the street and get out there to fill some pot holes with used coffee grounds; which as far as I can tell would hold up about as long as a city patch."}
{"text":"Always great service, friendly staff, timely and correct drink orders."}
{"text":"Will never come back. Takes 20 mins to have a drink made. Staff yelling at each other. Gave it another try after a few bad experiences nothing has changed."}
{"text":"Okay so first I mobile ordered a venti double chocolate chip frap,a grande mocha frap,a cookie dough cake pop,and a chocolate chip cookie. I pulled up to the box and got a Lovely greeting but I said I'm here to pick up a mobile order. I pulled up to the window for the barista named Trent to say it's 9.45$ even though I payed through the app with my Starbucks card. So I repeated my order to him to make sure he got it right and then he proceeded to say it's still 9.45. So I handed him my card and he scanned it then handed me someone else's order. I declined the drink and repeated what my order was again. That's when he handed me my drinks and one of my cake pops but not my chocolate chip cookie. He had such a dumb founded face on this entire time and after he said he put the money back on my card I looked at my account and it was not put back in. This is a horrible Starbucks who can't seem to do the simple task of completing an order that I made. I will definitely not be coming back to this Starbucks or any other one anymore because of this."}
{"text":"This location is great because they are opened 24 hours, but there really isn't much seating. They also have a great location (right next to the 401) and they have a drive through. If you are looking for a quick pick me up late at night his is a good stop but during the day it can get really busy."}
{"text":"I legitimately fear the location scouts for the Starbucks corporation.

How the hell do they do this?

It's almost as if they travel around to all of the existing local coffee hotshops and make detailed lists of all of the detriments that people find.

Then they make a list of all the great things that people love about their favorite hangouts in the neighborhood.

Then they make the bad disappear while accentuating the positive as they build their new location to spec.

This wonderful Starbucks has the vault of the Green Beanery, the communal tables of Saving Gigi, the classic comfort of the Hub and the time-tested consistency of Tim Hortons.   

But it also has air conditioning, outstanding wifi, ample seating and food options.    Something that none of these aforementioned area spots can solely offer.

It's evil genius, but it's still genius."}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times and the service is always friendly and the store tidy. Sometimes there is a huge lineup and other times it is quiet.

Tonight I went in for a latte night latte and ended up buying some amazing new packaged cookies they got. By Emmy's, they are vegan chocolate coconut almond macaroons and nice and squishy. Not too sweet. So yummy and love that Starbucks has added another treat for the vegans and those with egg or dairy allergies. :)"}
{"text":"It's unfortunate that this is the closest location to mountains edge. In the past year that Abel and Denise have left the customer service is absolutely horrible. It's astonishing the disdain some of the employees treat you with. I worked for Starbucks for 5 years and I understand how difficult guests can be at times. But I do expect to be greeted politely when I walk up to the counter and I also expect that if I call the store with a question about the way my drink is made in regards to ingredients that my question will be answered directly. There are 2 employees that work at nights that are very pleasant helpful which is the only reason this location got 2 stars. I really hope that the district manager will address the bad attitudes, poorly prepared drinks, wait times in the drive thru, and terrible customer service because I highly doubt I am the first person to complain. This store and group of employees does NOT inspire me to drop an average of $12 on coffee and snacks to be treated like garbage. I will definitely go out of my way to go to another location as often as possible"}
{"text":"They always mess up my order. I'm sick of it and I'm never going to this location again. 
They always make poor quality coffee and cold drinks. The staff are always standing around talking and on their phones."}
{"text":"Shame on me for letting them fool me more than once. I usually use the location near work but thought I'd give this one one more try. I ordered through my phone because I plan ahead and hate being late. Placed my order knowing it would take me 10 min to get there. Even though they say it will be ready in 3-6 minutes. I arrive, and go up to get my order...it's not ready yet so I wait. Eight minutes later (yes I was watching the clock) the barista at the pick up counter finally asks my name. After she looks for my cup I see it was on top of the machines. Empty!!! They are out of the main flavor for my drink. Really??? Well, I'm late for work and have to leave so I ask if they can reload my free drink back to my phone. She looks at me like a deer in headlights. I tell her that I placed my order with my free drink points. She still stares at me blankly then says, \"Oh no, we can't do that. But I can write your name on a piece of paper and you can come back.\" 
Ok, points for trying to make it \"right\" in the most pathetic way possible. I'm thinking to myself, I never come to this location and now you're asking me to go out of my way to come back! And I'm waisting my time right now even thinking about it because I need to get to work!!! It's Friday and I just wanted to treat myself to an delicious coffee with my free points that I'd been saving for that perfect day!!! Ugh! NO! 
So, to spite myself, I said don't worry about it and rushed out. I'm now running late and just needed to get on the road. 
So now I've been fuming all of the way to work trying to figure out if it's MY fault I'm out a free drink because I had to go...probably. Oh well. No Starbucks gift cards for friends this Christmas. Buying them all Coffee Bean so that they have to go there instead!"}
{"text":"They never have the bakery products that they display. Never! At the busiest time of their day, which is very predictable, between 1:30 and 3:30, they are usually understaffed with one person on the register and one barista and a line 10-15 people deep. 
I tried to buy a $25 gift card and $15 worth of drinks with a $50 bill and they said, \"We cannot break a fifty.\" So, luckily I was able to buy the GC with the extra cash I had, but no coffee for myself and my boss. When I gave the cashier $25 for the card she gave me $15 in change. I gave it back to her, because it was too much change, since I gave her the exact amount. Anyway, I just walked away in frustration. I love Starbucks, but this location has many issues."}
{"text":"This is a decent Starbucks. It's very open, and the staff was really nice the two times I went in. 

It's a little odd how this location shares space with a bank, and the bathrooms aren't part of Starbucks, but it was perfectly fine...especially since we were staying at the Courtyard next door."}
{"text":"On a good day,i give this a five star but today was a bad experience for me first time in 3 years. I work in William Penn bldg so this location is like 2 mins from my workplace. I get my cocoa cluster frapp sometimes in the morning before starting work or in the middle of the day,so i placed the order at 805 am using the mobile app,i got there usually even in a busy morning and my coffee is all ready to pick up. Unfortunately,noone knows how to make it,i followed up at 812 i told them i ordered cluster,the barista who was having a bad hair day keeps on whining about why this coffee is still in the menu. Hello? Is it my fault that this coffee is still in the menu and no one knows how to make it?? At around 815 i decided to cancel my order,the other lady told me they're making it and apologized,i said ok fine I'll wait. It took them forever to make it. The bad part was the barista who was there making coffee was very unpleasant. The other lady was nice enough to apologize for her."}
{"text":"This Starbucks should change its name to passive-aggression bucks... Or maybe we don't give a fuck, bucks. Or maybe Star \"We tilt the empty carafe to give you the shittiest drinking experience possible\" bucks."}
{"text":"Slowest Starbucks drive through ever. Nearly 25 minutes after ordering, I am still stuck, not at window. Doesn't seem busy inside. Love Starbucks but not coming back to this one."}
{"text":"While walking around Montreal we got thirsty and needed a break.  Starbucks are on every corner in the U.S. and apparently it's no different in some parts of Canada too.  But I thought maybe they'd have some different and interesting menu options.

Well, the menu is basically the same as the U.S., only in French.  I had my Iced Chai Latte, which was served quickly by some friendly baristas.  They had some issues swiping my credit card, but she was apologetic for the problem.

The inside of this Starbucks is a lot more open and inviting than most.  A lot of people chatting and studying here and a nice place to relax for us."}
{"text":"Light Ice!!!!!

Apparently \"light ice\" means 3/4 of the cup. I'm curious to know what regular or extra ice looks like? I ask for light ice because I don't like my drink to be diluted...AND this happens a lot. A LOT!"}
{"text":"Like mentioned, this is the slowest Starbucks in town. Came in twice in a week. First time I parked and went inside, waited at least a good 15mins. During the first 5-8 mins I figure I cut them some slack since they looked understaffed. Came to find out, they forgot about my drink or somehow my cup must have been misplaced. Second time I decided to go drive thru with 4 cars ahead of me. Total wait time was just under 20 mins but more than 15. What is wrong with this Starbucks? 

Although this is the nearest location to me, I sure wouldn't mind driving to windmill/LV blvd for coffee. After all that location is always consistent with my caramel macchiato."}
{"text":"The bog standard Starbucks, I suppose its location makes it a good one for U of T students. 

It could do with another cluster of comfy chairs, having four, but there's plenty of regular tables to take your coffee and snacks at. 

The layout is a little cozy. But that's not a flaw. 

The menu is the standard and the staff are pleasant, which earns them another star.  But that's prone to changing. Come by and grab your tall vanilla soy latte and take a load off your feet for a few minutes."}
{"text":"I don't often frequent starbucks because the starbucks inside Albertsons is fantastic. However, I have three children in karate and this starbucks is walking distance from their studio. So, today I go in and order my kids snack and drink items and I ask for a secret menu item. I ask them if they know how to make it and say I have the info in my phone. They assure me that Joey the worker will know how to make it. I pay and see Joey looking at my order. He says aloud, \"oh my\" in a disgusted tone. I ask him if he wants the instructions or ingredients as I have it in my phone. He looks up and says, \"no, its all right there just  OH my!\" So he calls me and i notice it's made incorrectly whatever. But i notice I'm charged for extra caramel drizzle and there is none. So, i go to the counter and ask for caramel drizzle where I'm met with \"are you serious?\" I told him if i paid for it, I would like some. He sighs and puts two drops on my whipped cream...seriously, how rude? If you didnt want to make designer coffee drinks, dont work at starbucks...never again"}
{"text":"I'm here at least once a week because I'm in the area for work. At around noon, it's always packed with high school students, locals, and people who work in the area - seating can be hard to find at times, but I luck out and usually find a place to sit. Service can be a hit or miss - my most recent visit was a miss as the Barista on cash was extremely rude. But then the week prior, the person on cash was super friendly. I'll never figure it out. As for the beverages and food - it's the same Starbucks stuff I can find at every single location in the city. I will keep coming here as long as I'm in the area for work.

Good for: coffee (obvi!), getting work done"}
{"text":"Your average Starbucks. I used to work in the area so I'd come here at least once a day for my caffeine fix. It's always busy here (likely because of its location). There's a patio area that faces Erskine, which is nice on hot summer days. The space is quite small so there are maybe 3, 4 tables max. It's a great place for people watching as there are all different walks of life here. Nothing really stands out for me that I would give this place four or five stars. I ordered a drink and they made a mistake so I was given an extra drink for free, which was appreciated.

Good for: coffee"}
{"text":"I usually grab a cup of joe here before an appointment at NailSense two blocks away. Also, I work/live in the area so I've chosen this spot a couple of times to finish paperwork. 

Very spacious w WiFi (like all Starbucks locations), this joint is perfect when killing time or when you have to get some work done. 

Employees are super friendly. Wait times for drinks are not too long.

No parking on site, but there is a lot of street parking around.

A 4 star here."}
{"text":"Busy busy busy!! But they know how to make my iced Venti Black Tea Latte without being confused as heck. Probably because being in a mall they are way busier than other SB's."}
{"text":"Not the friendliest Starbucks but it's close to home. Just got a latte and it was made like a cappuccino. If i had wanted a half empty cup of coffee I would've ordered a cappuccino."}
{"text":"Seriously every time I come here I don't get the usual friendly feeling I get from other Starbucks. At my last visit the barista was a total idiot!! She had her damn fingers inside the cups whenever she brought then to a different counter. How hard is it to use two hands to hold the outside of the cup?? I sure hope she washed her hands. I am so miffed!! It never ceases to amuse me how stupid the workers here really are. Attitude."}
{"text":"This is one of the nicest Starbucks locations in town, Crystal mall's ultra luxury environment offers a great setting, and the products are Starbucks quality as you'd expect in any of their locations. HOWEVER, at $7.31 the grande frappuccino, it's a little bit overpriced for a coffee! I'll pass!"}
{"text":"Ordered a London fog with coconut milk. Got a cup of water with two t-bags, barely any milk and no syrup almost $6 and was super gross and bitter. Next day I went back and ordered a white chiclayo mocha. It was better. I tried to mention the London Fog to the cashier as constructive criticism. She just looked at me and nodded. Barely spoke English and had no clue what I was saying. I feel like the management is slipping after being unhappy at 3 locations. I'm converting to second cup. They are more consistent."}
{"text":"Starbucks seems to be getting more expensive every time I go and this location was no exception. $6.98 for a grande white mocha is testing my price limit for leaving empty handed. The line was fairly long and the staff weren't very friendly. They wanted nothing to do with my rewards card which was a bummer because of how much it was for one cup of joe. I am beginning to think you just can't get a decent cup of coffee anywhere on the strip without paying dearly for it. Convenience has it's cost, unfortunately and I don't plan on returning to this location on my next visit."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Starbucks! The drive thru wait is reasonable. I love the screen on the menu when you can actually see the baristas when they're taking your order- it's so much more personable! 

The quality and level of service is always great! I'm so happy this location opened up. Perfect for my commute to and from work."}
{"text":"Nice and clean area, friendly staff, great location; this is one of my favorite Starbucks!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite starbucks. I come here to study pretty often, because the one near eastern and 215 is ALWAYS packed. This has recently been renovated and now there's lots of chairs and tables inside and outside. The tables by the bathroom have outlets near them. So go there if you need to charge your device. 

Since they changed their teas, I usually get the bottle of peach tea from TeaVanna w/ a cup of ice. This tea is not too sweet but the flavor of peach is perfectly mixed in. 

The only negative thing i have to say about this location is the parking. You'll have to park at Trader Joe's and walk across to starbucks. There is only around 6 spots in front of the starbucks."}
{"text":"When I first moved to this area this Starbucks was a Coffee Bean. I was sure glad when Coffee Bean left and Starbucks arrived. It was a much needed upgrade in coffee selections at GVR. This location is very convenient if you are looking for good coffee at GVR or while shopping at The District. 

I typically visit this location on weekend afternoons and they're never busy. The staff is quick with making orders and my drinks have always tasted consistent with drinks I get from other locations. The shop is clean and has a few seats and a few tables to relax."}
{"text":"This is a very spacious Starbucks with plenty of parking. It seems to be a pretty popular spot being that I have visited several times and it has always been packed with people enjoying coffee while working or visiting with friends. I have never used the drive through. It's not my thing and with mobile ordering it's so easy to get in and out. The bathroom was a little messy when I was here but nothing too crazy. I will definitely return to get some work done in the future."}
{"text":"Today I ordered the same drink from yesterday at this location. A trenta jade citrus mint ICED tea. Today they told me they dont do that for that tea, even though I just ordered it yesterday. Kinda got a hard time getting my order. And they gave me a venti size instead of my trenta. I asked for light ice and she shoved more ice into the cup. 

Literally the only Starbucks so far that doesn't give me a hard time and always gets my order right is on Eastern and Russell"}
{"text":"First and last time to this location five people came in after me and I had to wait for my mocha.  Very sad because the guy after had to wait for his drink too.  The sad part  is they didn't even apologize."}
{"text":"2nd floor Starbucks is always at times. It's next to game arcade and escalators. I stopped by evening time for a cold ice tea and ran out of peach green tea so I purchased passion fruit ice tea. Depending on the staff person, they are friendly and nice or just cordial. Tip is to show mlife card to get points.  I wasn't able to use Mlife and Starbucks gift card at the sane time when paying. The tables are clean and plenty of seating."}
{"text":"I stop at this Starbucks on my way to work, it is the closet location to my work on the route that I take. They have plenty of parking but only one way into the parking lot, which can be a pain due to when the drive-thru line is long. The staff is friendly and have my mobile order always ready when I arrive no matter when I order. The place is lighted nicely, plenty of seats and it is clean. It is located in a prime location in the Edgewater area. I would recommend this location if you are in the area."}
{"text":"When I first saw a drive-through Starbucks...I was ecstatic.  I think there is only one drive-through in Cali which I heard was in Livermore (which was very far from where I used to live so I never even knew)
It sure made it very convenient esp for those with kids or if it's too hot to get out or if the weather is sucky...drive-through is the way to go. 
But I have been very disappointed lately with the service at Starbucks.
Maybe because there are new people there or they are just too wired to actually pay attention to my order to get it right.
I will go to Starbucks in the am and order the same thing.  50% of the time they will get it right. 
How hard is it to make a VENTI ICED AMERICANO WITH AN ADD SHOT, TOFFEE NUT SYRUP AND CREAM.  
One time they used hazelnut...i know my syrups!!!..
One time it was too sweet
One time they gave me someone else's drink
One time it was almost like a latte - all milk
One time I actually had to go back and got the right one. 

I love Starbucks...but come on now....aren't all the drinks supposed to be uniform according to how it is ordered????

My drink is simple....I don't want to have to accuse of someone slippin some kahlua in the baristas drinks before shift!!!"}
{"text":"I have a Xmas gift certificate to Starbucks and my shopping and banking was going so pleasantly today I decided to give my gift card a swipe.  The Starbucks here is an island incarnation with around a dozen high stools and around 4 staff members.

As I stood in line, the girl in front of me was obviously a friend of the barista and they were talking about their plan for the weekend.  I don't mind if it is a quick interaction but it was dragging for a bit, I mean I am obviously a customer standing there and they still kept talking. I don't know man talk and serve me; make my coffee, multi task for crying out loud, it doesn't take much.

I finally got my brew and forgot about the whole thing but I noticed the three other staff girls in deep conversation on the side.  Starbucks I know you are an island but you don't have to act like you are on one."}
{"text":"Starbucks coffee on 4th Street SW is for me always a sociological event of classism.

Again the usual, Hummers, Porches and Lamborghinis line up the streets surrounding it, to get there morning fix of java. 

But the most entertaining thing for me is the conversations there, a mix of vegan or health, to business and multi-million transactions.  Many tables often sit one person and laptop.  Cliental enjoying the perks and upper scale prices of cardboard copy Starbucks.

Lines are frequent here but if I do indulge in that cookie, scone or latte, the staff is always friendly and the space is always clean. 

 A nice thing about this Starbucks is the second floor.  This is where I can chill alone most of the time and take an eagles view of Mission on goings and The Elbow River."}
{"text":"This Starbucks location is extremely convenient when you're in Forum Shops and a bit of a cheaper alternative than the casino location, which happens to be in quite a busy spot at their food court (and if the reviews of it are to be believed, doesn't quite deliver good service). 
As a mall worker, I frequent this location for lunchtime snacks or a quick drink to keep me going. There have been absolutely no complaints about how I've been served, whether I'm recognized by a barista as a Forum Shops employee or just some regular schmuck. The drinks, food and snacks here are of a quality I would expect from a nice Strip-side Starbucks, but with way more agreeable pricing. 
All in all, it's my Starbucks of choice for when I'm in or around Caesars Palace."}
{"text":"Despite being the only Starbucks in the immediate Southwest side of Las Vegas- catering to Southern Highlands and Mountains Edge alike- this store works hard to try and make it work with their increased customer traffic. Went in today and there were so many mobile orders that an employee was posted on the customer-side of the counter organizing orders and talking to customers. I knew she was working on mine, and she remembered me when mine finally came up. Keep it up team. This is making the most out of a situation that's uncontrollable."}
{"text":"Good Morning Southern Highlands getting my day started with nice cup of coffee. Love the neighborhood. The only drawback is they don't deliver :)"}
{"text":"I walked in and the place was packed, but the staff still found a moment to welcome me in. The line up was manageable and they got my order right.

Like most Starbucks, the staff tried to get to know me while making my drinks. While looking around, I found the place quite clean, but there was a group of students who were a bit loud - so I didn't end up staying."}
{"text":"Came in to meet a client, the place is quieter than most Starbucks but then again it could just be the time I'm here (9:15pm). The place is on the smaller side, clean and the waitstaff were very welcoming and friendly. 

I ordered a chamomile tea and almond croissant while my client picked up an iced black coffee. 

Tip: it's a good place for reading and studying"}
{"text":"I went there the first morning and the woman was very rude and extremely slow doing other things and ignoring I was there completely when I was the only customer. Decided to try again this morning and the same thing happened. I was late to work and she just continued to do other things was rude to me and not happy like normal Starbucks employees. She then continued to walk around and do other things instead of making my coffee. Very frustrating"}
{"text":"Not a bad location, it's beautiful and secluded in a corner that makes the noise a non-issue. 
The prices are higher than I'm used to, and I was disappointed to find out they don't accept reward drinks at this location. Otherwise it meets all of the high standards set for the Starbucks brand."}
{"text":"Drive-thru line last two times I've been has been the quickest I've experienced for Starbucks! You can tell they're really striving to be the quickest as their sign says when you enter the drive-thru. Also, shout out to Brandon for making my morning brighter!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience, first I was rudely told by the woman in the drive thru that she couldnt hear me. I raised my voice and she repeated my order.  I paid for it and drove off.  2 miles away I discovered I had a coffee I didn't order.  Drove back and went inside. They had 5 employees working,  I was able to go right up to the counter and tell the cashier. He took my order again and I waited and waited. 10 minutes of which all this time they were talking and laughing. I, very frustrated asked If my order was forgotten. The girl told me the coffee machine was broken.  Unbelievable!! So at this point more upset I said why wasn't I told.  She made my drink, and said in a very snotty tone sorry about that.  I said, \"no I'm sorry, sorry I ever came here\". Never again!  I had to give you one star because it wouldn't let me continue with zero stars. This place deserves no stars, very poor customer service."}
{"text":"The people who work here are angels. They let me bring books into the cafe to read even though there's a huge intimidating OFFICIAL SIGNAGE saying it's not allowed.

It's also where I had my first starbucks drink. ahhh, memories. from then on I kind of was a starbucks maniac. still am. guiltyyy.

Food/drinks/prep time: typical starbucks."}
{"text":"I love the dog that hangs out outside (I think his owner is probably a barista). He's always tied to like a sign pole or something on the corner and he has a little bowl of water.

I don't think I need to review the food/drinks here as we all know that starbucks is starbucks.

I like the atmosphere inside. A few window/tall chairs, and a few tables--normal seating but the location seems smaller than others. It gives this starbucks a kind of cozy feeling which I like with my hot drinks! :]"}
{"text":"Love my Starbucks home away from home.  I'm always happy to find my 'Bucks' when I'm not in my usual location!   All they need now is to carry Stevia for their customers.
I always use my APP when I buy my coffee drink, careful not to overdue the calorie intake, I skip the whipping cream or overly sweet drinks."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at Starbucks and as far as this area is concerned, this is my least favorite location. Service is okay but every time I was ever truly disappointed in my order it was from here. Watery frappes, meat in my non-meat sandwiches etc. If you have time swing by another location"}
{"text":"I love the location of this Starbucks. Plus its new and nice. However although the drive thru workers are always great the inside service people isn't so happy. There's a few people in there that seem to hate their job or just don't like people. Which is sad. Because I go there all the time. People In Customer service should be happy. How is that I have to say thank you to people passing me my food and they aren't the ones telling me thank you? That confuses me. They pass to me and not even a smile. Staff you need to beef it up. It's Christmas."}
{"text":"One of the very few Starbucks that have the Clover machine. On select locations carry this machine. You choose the coffee you including the exotic beans that they don't brew I house , they grind it for you and the use the Clover Machine to do your own special brew. No burnt tasting coffee. I personally get the Amazonas Peru or the Brazil. Kid you don't mind spending a little extra for this special brew then it's well worth it. 

Downfall.... This location is small. There was about 15 people in line with one cashier. I like to go to Starbucks that have clean brewing stations and there's was ok. No the worst but not the best. 

This location gets a five star from me because they have the Clover."}
{"text":"starbucks for me is definitely one of the best coffees in America. compared to other coffee, starbucks is a bit expensive but i think its well worth it. it will make ur taste buds feel like heaven!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has a bad review but the baristas are friendly and as always my coffee is delicious. 
CORRECTION, I came back the next day and I understand why it's three stars. They are horribly slow. Four people in front of me and I waited over 10 minutes because the new person was doing my coffee and the other two people watched. Seriously?!? I'm in a hurry."}
{"text":"This place hardly qualifies as a Starbucks. Service was unbelievably slow which is atypical of a Starbucks. We were told they would bring our microwaved sandwiches to us in the patio when they were ready. After 10 minutes I went in to check on the status of the sandwiches and the woman who helped us asked another women where they were. Mine was sitting on the far end of the counter! They said they had already taken my wife's out to her. I assured them that they had not, but they followed me to the patio to check! About 2 minutes later they brought it to her. They were not busy and had 4 people behind the counter. My steak and egg wrap was burnt and tasted so bland. All the meat was shoved to one end of the wrap. Would not recommend the food or the service here but we did enjoy the warm sun on our backs out on the patio by the JW Marriott herb garden on this Nee Years day."}
{"text":"I come to this location pretty frequently.  The service is usually pretty quick (I have never used the drive-thru).  The staff is friendly and nice.  The Wi-Fi is horrible though.  Although it is free, the Wi-Fi is my main reason for coming to Starbucks, where I in turn spend money on drinks, etc."}
{"text":"This is my second time at this Starbuck. Not sure why the staff are so stupid but they got our two drinks wrong.  

The barista filled our iced coffee to the top when we asked for room for cream. 

The iced green tea latte was filled an inch from the top a filled FULL of ice. Two big sips and it was gone. 

I can see why others have rated this low. Won't be coming back to this one."}
{"text":"I love Starbucks but these place is something else. They have way too many workers doing god knows what. The cashier doesn't look up or smile when taking your order. I always order the same drink cinnamon dolce but it taste funny when I order it twice here. I would not waste my time coming to this place keep driving go to the Starbucks on Flamingo and sandhill"}
{"text":"Won't be back to this location.  Had dinner in hand from Chipotle next door and dashed in here to get drinks.  No one else was there except this guy, who I can only assume was an off duty employee or friend of the barista.  I ordered and my iced cold brew with soy milk was disgusting, which the poor cashier had to make because the barista to too busy talking and snap chatting with the guy visiting.  When more people came in she had to go back to the register and after watching the barista ignore my second drink for 3 or 4 mins, I walked over to the bar and stared at him.  He continued to talk to the friend while half heartedly making my second drink.  When he got halfway through with it the lady who ordered 5 mins after me was standing at the bar and he put my drink down, questioned her about hers and started making her drink!  The cashier had to leave the register and finish making my second drink, all the while this off duty employee or friend is obliviously chatting away.  Nothing irritates me more than when employees have friends or off duty employees in the workplace and focus on them like it's social hour instead of paying attention to the customers...and the off duty employees should know better!!  Needless to say I will not waste my time going back to this location.  Hopefully a manager will see this and act accordingly.  Whoever the male barista was that was working Friday the 29th around 7:30pm...and give that female cashier a raise because she was doing his and her job..."}
{"text":"It was ok, line looked terrible terrible but was only 5 minutes. The store is a little little small little small for little small for the amount of activity it gets. We got breakfast sandwiches which were tasty. I've previously had the Carmel maccieatto or however you spell that and that is just fantastic - it. Makes my whole day just thinking about the whip cream!"}
{"text":"Located inside Tropicana.

Came here for a late night drink because I was parched.

The service was fast and friendly and the decor was clean and trendy.

Although the prices may be higher than at other locations, it's still cheaper than purchasing drinks at other stores in the nearby casinos."}
{"text":"I have to write this review because this happen to me a few times and I will never come here again. 

As a student here at campus, I came here this morning and waited in a long line. I believe the person who took my order was a manager here because he is always there. He was impatient and rude, I hope the school read this so they can provided better training for their employees."}
{"text":"Starbucks is Starbucks is Starbucks.

They do what they do & you pay & leave.

This is a large, spacewise, but also attached to the Omni William Penn Lobby."}
{"text":"Very nice starbucks In downtown core. College station is several steps away. Holiday inn is right beside the cafe. The baristas are friendly."}
{"text":"I should have gone to the COFFEE BEAN across the street. They are Always good. 
I got a Venti Carmel Frap Ultra and it was Horrible to say the least. Undrinkable 
It was nothing but ground up ice and a little coffee. It didn't have any Carmel at all!!
This is the 2nd time I've had a horrible drink here. I'm done with them. I would have returned it but we were headed to the other side of town and had time constraints."}
{"text":"My friend didn't listen to me and went to this location because she was going to be late for class. Since she doesn't have a yelp account, I'm going to write her review for her. The manager there is beyond rude. This is the most overpriced Starbucks ever. She didn't explain why costs were so high when asked and when my friend went to the counter to pour some cream into her drink, the manager stopped her and said \"imma have to charge you for that\". What's the point of having the condiment bar there if you're gonna charge for a tiny bit of cream? Cheapest manager ever. This is the first Starbucks that I've ever been to that has the rudest and cheapest manager. Do yourself a favor and do not go there. Why waste your money for this rude b****?"}
{"text":"For a Starbucks, you get your regular drink prepared the same way as elsewhere. Hot water is hot water anywhere. This location is great on nice sunny days,  the large windows allow excellent viewing of outside and of by lake Ontario. High wooden ceilings make it feel bigger than it really is. It gives off the feel of a more \"tourist location\" than say a Starbucks in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Terrible service....not only did they get my order wrong but gave me immense attitude when I tried to correct it. Blamed me for getting the order wrong and saying I come to Starbucks enough to know what to say when I order. Probably the worst service I have ever received at any Starbucks ever. Unacceptable!!! Won't come back."}
{"text":"I love this location. The guys that work this location are the BEST! They're a lot friendlier than some of the girls that work there. They laugh and joke with the customers which is nice at the beginning of a long work day! The app comes in handy here because again, this is tower city and there are business attached, so there will be a wait if you just go without using it. That's not the staff fault. They do a great job keeping up with the work flow and making sure people aren't waiting long. I love their bacon Gouda sammich! It's my go to breakfast when I order from here. I like their bagels but they don't seem very filling. This location makes the BEST frappes! They're always on point! Perfectly made and they all load the drizzle on them. Their mango tea is great as well! This location is clean as well. Their little stand is always full of straws, sugar, napkins and stirs. The minute it's messy, someone is there cleaning it. If the creamers are empty, they will gladly fill them up no questions asked and no attitude given for stopping them from what they're doing. You can tip them on that app, and you should at this location. The staff deserves it! Always busy non stop! Great people. 
I've ordered from there a lot. Not as much recently because it's expensive and it adds up. Yes, you get points for orders but it seems like it takes forever to collect them. I've only got one free drink and I used to order every day!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with Starbucks lately. I don't know what it is, but either the employees are lazy, making excuses  or just do not care. Every single Starbucks I've been to, they either tell you that they are out of this or that, sold out or they just do not want to make your beverage. I'm not a demanding brat, but when you are having a special and you know that it's going to be in demand. You need to be prepared, be well stocked, and stop making excuses. I'm not one of those entitled customers, and I always tip well!  I'm just tired of stores who cannot keep up with specials. What could have been a profitable beverage for them turned into an absolute fail. 
P.S. Oh...I never did find that unicorn frapp at any of the Starbucks I've been to. I finally gave up!

{"text":"This is the fastest Starbucks in town!!!!!  I only go to the drive thru.  It seems like seconds to get your coffee.  That is if you aren't behind a moron that orders tons of food.  Love this Starbucks!"}
{"text":"It might be the nicest store , as far as space &  building material  goes . However , if half of the baristas are new and the other half have really bad attitudes then piece out .its not my place to let them know about their really really unpleasant atmosphere but that wasn't the case for another costumer . Lol , she felt she had to set them straight .
BTW , when they charge you for waiting ten minutes while they brew  pike that says a lot . Good thing I don't live up here , I just visit every other month or so .  O & there wifi is non existent on the patio , writing review using LTE :( REALLY , COME ON !"}
{"text":"I usually come to this Starbucks in the morning right before work, and the service is fast Ns the staff is friendly. Today, I decided to go around noon before the rush and grab my coworkers drinks. So, I noticed one of the drinks were easily misunderstood and I went back to the drive-thru to replace my order. I didn't care about getting charged again, but what I do care about is how the staff member threw my change back at me from frustration. I was not able to ask for a coaster since she closed the door right after. Eventually, I had to carry my drinks in my arm and to my luck the drink bursts on my arm. So if your goal is to be the fastest Starbucks, maybe the staff needs to chill sometimes."}
{"text":"Spacious room, close to home and friendly staff (Zach is the coolest barista)! I like coming here for a drink and to do some work. I have never had an issue finding a seat, but sometimes it is admittedly kind of loud when a large group of high school kids come in or moms decide to make Starbucks their play date place (half priced fraps= worst time to come in!). Otherwise I like this place. All the staff is really nice and they usually have my drink done before I sit down, which is nice. Overall ambience is good and I would definitely recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"I've visited this place twice in the past week and each time I was welcomed with a delish smell of Java and a bright happy smile. I love me a good coffee and delish snack before work. Their pastry selection seems good and fresh. A tad overpriced IMO. It can get busy and chaotic during lunch since there's a lot of traffic in this area."}
{"text":"I'm able to get a venti iced coffee with milk or green tea (unsweetened) for under $3 in this hot ass day. Free iced water too. Minus one star for long lines in the drive-thru. #winning"}
{"text":"Typisch überteuerte Starbucks Filiale in einem der großen Casinos auf dem Las Vegas Strip. Was hier besonders negativ auffällt, ist das Fehlen des üblichen WLAN, die leeren Regale der Kühltheke und das Chaos hinter dem Tresen sobald mehr als zwei Gäste zu bedienen sind. Es gibt natürlich auch keinen gemütlichen Sitzbereich und daher empfehle ich einfach diese Filiale auszulassen und die Kaffeegelüste bis zur nächsten gemütlichen SB Geschäftsstelle zurück zu stellen."}
{"text":"Very slow service and pricing is high for what you get and the pumpkin latte had a bad after taste had to dump it."}
{"text":"This is a new Starbucks and we liked it.. They were friendly, got our drinks correct and it was easy to get in and out."}
{"text":"I just can't even with this place. 

I have debated not writing a review because I am a starbucks Barista, but 1. This place isn't owned by Starbucks, and 2. I don't work here, so in the nicest way I could say this, I don't give a sh** about this location. 

Not only is the training half assed but the baristas couldn't care a nickel about any of their customers. They are rude, lazy, and poorly trained. I have been unfortunate to have to come here in between classes instead of walking across the street to my own location. 

This location does not hold the same values as Starbucks, and I can promise you that every time I have watched them, they do not make your drinks correctly. 

Save the extra money you are spending by supporting Aramark. I am not saying you have to go to Starbucks. There is a coffee bean on campus and across the street that actually care. 

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"This store is tucked behind the Shell gas station and you can't really see it from Bathurst St. 

The interior is that hip combination of rustic and modern. The outside walls are all glass. The inside walls are covered by oak floor panels contributing to that almost cottagy feel.

My pet peeve, the music that's too loud at so many coffee shops. Here, it's there to enjoy and mask the industrial sounds of coffee machines but still soft enough so you can carry on a conversation without straining your vocal chords."}
{"text":"Annoyed by this \"drive thru\" location. A friend and I made plans to meet for a coffee and chat, this Starbucks was closest so we decided to go here. Neither of us knew it was drive thru ONLY. Get there and realize that we can't go inside okay so we'll sit on the patio. Except the outside window on the patio is closed and you have to go through the drive-thru to get a drink. Looks like we're going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Always outstanding service & coffee. Employees are nice & will take the time to make sure your order is correct & to your liking."}
{"text":"Wow! I got in line at 8:32 and it's 9:05

This line was ridiculous! I seriously do not understand why Starbucks owners do not properly staff. I get it I probably came in during a rush but wow! That was a long wait. My drink was warm not really hot so maybe a few cars ahead someone had a large order? Not sure but I won't be back to this location. Best of luck Starbucks. Not to mention the price in increase in drinks! Yikes, $5.00 for a medium drink. Come on Starbucks, stop being gre"}
{"text":"Staff is friendly,efficient and professional. Inside and at the drive thru is clean. So happy they moved to this new building within the same plaza. They always seem to have a long drive thru but The line goes quick."}
{"text":"This Starbucks, along with the majority in the Las Vegas area, gives the company a bad name.  I say this as a 20 year resident of Washington State who has enjoyed a cup of coffee in fine establishments all over the U.S.  Today there were eight employees frantically moving about, yet they produced a cup of coffee every 2-3 minutes.  Sure they were busy, but the obvious lack of training and teamwork was sorry.  On top of this, the counter was covered in a milky, coffee-like substance.  They served everyone's drinks on top of this pool of nastiness.  The kicker was that the straw and napkin area had both garbage cans overflowing, and sugar and wrappers spilling onto the floor.  If I owned or managed this location, I'd be embarrassed.  

The coffee tasted alright, as it should for $5 per drink.  

In my mind, Starbucks has devolved so much that it has become the McDonald's of coffee houses.  In short, I get better coffee every time I go to a mom and pop espresso kiosk."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to this Starbucks and never have had a real bad experience. I look forward to the greets & small talk of a retired group of biker men, who hang out every day for their morning cup of Joe. The staff is friendly, they pretty know my usual drinks of choice, and most of them know my name. My only main complaint is why bother having 2 cash registers if your only going to use one!!!! Even when the line is long...there is only one cashier taking and ringing up orders!!! Please have a 2nd cashier!!!It would make the line go so much faster!!! Especially now that the Moutain's Edge & Southern Highlands connector bridge opened, it has brought more patrons into this Starbucks. This is why I only gave 4 stars instead of 5 stars!!!"}
{"text":"Sitting here waiting 25 minutes for 2 iced Carml Macchs and after waiting they made us the wrong drinks!!!! Slowesr location I've ever been too."}
{"text":"Staff have not been the friendliest. This morning was it for me. Went thru the drive thru to order. Asked for several different flavors which they didn't have yet still advertise on their boards. The guy taking my order told me to stop living in the past with my drink orders as the holidays are over yet they advertise them still?? Who says that to a customer ??? I won't go back to this location"}
{"text":"Tried the new Triple Mocha Frap, asked for 1/2 syrup but the drink was still really sweet..... gonna get diabetes from this lol but I guess it's like that with all fraps. Nevertheless, the drink was very yummy! The cashier and barista that served me were both very friendly, even on a hot and busy summer afternoon. They were also very fast and efficient. This location doesn't really have space to sit, there were only a few single tables, so it's definitely not a \"hang out\" Starbucks, more like a grab and go. The tables were also kind of dirty, had crumbs everywhere and was sticky so I felt uncomfortable sitting down anyways."}
{"text":"Ummm...I guess I shouldn't expect more considering the employees probably live in the area,  but nonetheless, I expected more....I mean,  doesn't Starbucks expect more???

I happen to be driving through the area and made a stop off...the moment you walk in you can tell the experience is going to be a bit different than other locations just based on the baristas non eye contact and throwing of straws to customers ahead of me. 

My favorite is when the snippy barista tried to speak down to the kid who very obviously has a higher level of social graces and intellect than she....he handled hisself well and we made contact and instantly knew we both were not from that area. 

Bottom line,  G-H-E-T-T-O.....you don't want people thinking you're a hood rat, then you probably shouldn't act like one. 

Take advantage of the tuition reimbursement for crying out loud, you messed up the kids order cause you couldn't spell his name right,  then you try to talk down to him...really?!?! You spelled it wrong. 

People will keep going because it's Starbucks....hood rats will continue to work there because they need to supplement public assistance,  but be aware that you are definitely stepping into a different world if you are a regular at any other Starbucks in the valley..."}
{"text":"Not all Starbucks' are equal. This one is brand new, spacious, has a drive through, and is open until 9:30pm. No complaints here! The baristas are super friendly and helpful to a late-blooming coffee lover. :-)"}
{"text":"What a bad starbucks I drink starbucks everyday and the fact that i work in this mall is the only thing that will keep me coming here. The staff is super slow like today someone was sweeping while the line almost went out the door... Sweep when the line calms down not at 9:30 Am when all the mall workers are trying to get to work! Then they take forever to make my drink and while they do that the insist one trying to make small talk with every customer less smalltalk I haven't had my coffee yet hence when I'm here! 

The mall needs another starbucks so badly it isn't funny because this place is so annoying to go to. Plus it isn't even in the mall so if I want to go here on my break my options are to Freeze on the walk over or the lug around my jacket and Im too lazy for that so chances are I'll just force myself to freeze in the winter. 

although its a bad starbucks they haven't messed ump drink so thats a bonus and I'll be back because its the most convenient when I'm working."}
{"text":"I don't really review chains because honestly it's Starbucks coffee.. not much to criticize - they are all the same basically.

BUT...

This is my Davisville Starbucks Family.
They just reopened today with their brand new look and it looks divine!
Nice new bar that you can sit on and the staff are the best! 
It's like walking into your family's house for a cup of Java.

Big shoutout to Ethan! He is absolutely hilarious and drives my boss nuts which is always a bonus.  Good banter back and forth    :) 

Welcome back guys!"}
{"text":"This Starbucks is new, big, with ample seating space and cool lamps. The service is fast and friendly, and you can find different kinds of ground coffee, coffee pods, mugs and cups for sale. There is also free parking and it's right next to Costco. This Starbucks is one of my favorites because it's so spacious! Love it!"}
{"text":"I went at night with friends -- it was a cold night and my Carmel Apple cider hit the spot! It was so yummy-- the Carmel/apple ratio was perfect! They were out of apple juice & used little juice boxes to make my drink. It was so kind for the barista to go the extra mile! And I love that it wasn't busy at all! I even found a little birthday gift for a friend while i was there!!! Yea!"}
{"text":"When I heard that starbucks was coming to the area I was pretty excited because I had recently bought a home nearby. They did a beautiful job on the reno, inside and out. The first weekend it was open it was full of parents with strollers, and people sitting quietly upstairs on laptops or sitting with friends. I really think it will be great for the area. Definitely great to have another spot to grab a drink or a bite. I had a breakfast wrap when i was there. I liked it."}
{"text":"I love this Starbucks!!!! The staff is very friendly and the drinks are always good!!! The layout of the Starbucks is great as well!"}
{"text":"This location is a two-minute walk from the Bessarion Subway station on the Sheppard line. There is also plenty of parking, and I love the patio seating here. It's located right beside an Ikea and a Canadian Tire store, so there is a lot of traffic around here!  This is the only Starbucks in the area open every day; the Starbucks in Bayview Village is inside the Chapters store, so it's only open when Chapters is open."}
{"text":"The lineup here always seems to move briskly and it's a great location. I come here more than anywhere else in the food court and the service is great."}
{"text":"Yes, this location always has a lineup, but they also have a small patio and a cozy seating area. Great location with plenty of other things to do nearby - staff do their best to keep things moving!"}
{"text":"This location is always packed with the most random people. I've come to the conclusion that many are salespeople coming to meet up with clients because this doesn't look like the average student crowd.  The line is always long but I've never had to wait more than 2 minutes, so the staff here know how to keep things moving along.

Lots of free parking but BE CAREFUL in the parking lot. I've seen at least 2 accidents at the parking lot entrance in the past year and drivers are very aggressive here. Location in strip mall is handy for quick shopping trips."}
{"text":"This location is close to home, so it's very convenient and it opens super early (usually around 5:30 am). This is great when I need to grab a coffee before getting on an early morning subway. The staff here are friendly and some even go the extra mile to make sure I leave satisfied - they've offered to re-make my drink twice on days when the situations looked a bit doubtful. It's pretty busy with local residents usually but they don't have some of the specialty items (like their new cold brew)."}
{"text":"I generally avoid this Starbucks because the lineup is always long and so is the wait for anything I've ever ordered. You can actually SIT (that is if you can FIND a seat) and wait for your drink, or you can wait in line with the other sullen-looking patrons. The staff are mostly friendly but I don't understand why they can't hire more - I've been here 20+ times over the last 2 years and I've waited at least 5-10 minutes AFTER ordering every time.

There is hardly ever a place to sit because students set up camp and stay for hours, which is fine but not exactly welcoming for other patrons. Bottom line: try another location for faster service."}
{"text":"This Starbucks is the closest one to my boyfriends house but I hate coming here. The drive through is always 6-7 cars deep and there is always a line inside. Every time I come here there are obviously not enough employees for how popular this location is. 

They are constantly out of stock of basic supplies like coffee cozies or stoppers or certain length straws. Every time it seems to be something new and it's just annoying.

Lastly, behind the counter is one huge MESS! It's gross! the blenders have old drink remains in them, the counters have small milky puddles on them, milk being left on the counter between making drinks, and the food sits on a rack behind the fridge UNREFRIGERATED! One time I even saw a pregnant employee slip and fall to the ground while making a drink. Probably because the floors were wet!

The owner and management of this store need a wake up call! Please staff accordingly so that you're employees have time to clean and serve the amount of people knocking on your door! The health code violations here are out of control!"}
{"text":"Slowest Starbucks in town. The guy in the drive thru never gives me back my change. I have to ask for it. Skim much?"}
{"text":"There are 2 SB locations at Square One:  Food Central and upper-level of Target, near entrance/exit doors of bus terminal.  If there's a long ass line at food court location, head to the Target one!  However, the Target one is a little less efficient for some reason.

Person who took my order was friendly, but I had to wait quite a while for my drink.  Perhaps the food court SB barista works faster 'cause they're used to the long queue?  I dunno.

There can be a line @ the Target SB as well, but definitely less of one than Food Central!

Btw, Chocolate Chai Latte was pretty gross, but it's just a personal preference.  Tasted like the Chai Latte, which I really like, but with chocolate milk.  Not a good combo!"}
{"text":"It's a Starbucks.  However, it's worth mentioning, hence the review, that the parking situation here was poorly designed.  Patrons basically hafta walk through a Canadian Tire gas station in order to get to their cars.  Quite dangerous actually.

While other lazy people/people who are just picking up drinks, end up parking along a fire route.

When I stopped in for the Frap \"Happy Hour\", I noticed that they trained the staff to ask if I wanted anything to eat or a $0.99 cookie straw to drink my Green Tea Frap??  Uh...no, gross, just the cheap drink thankyouverymuch.  Nice try though!"}
{"text":"Note:  For the lndigo location which is attached to the mall, NOT the SB in which you hafta walk outside of mall to access.

Warning, this place is hella slow IF you visit while people are training.  There were 2 girls during the time of my visit and I stood in line, only person there, for quite a few minutes while 1 girl was making a drink and the other girl, who I assume was training, was doing something with her back towards me.  She seemed nervous, so I think she was trying to avoid interacting with customers.

Finally, it was the barista who was making a drink who acknowledged me.  It was very strange as in most locations, they say \"Hi\" and want to take your order ASAP!

After I order my drink, I waited some more, until the slightly more experienced one said they were out of Blonde and had to wait for it for them to make more.  Ummm...ok.  Then she said the machine was broken, spoke to some kinda manager, and offered to make me any other drink off the menu in Venti + whatever bakery item I wanted.

When I got my drink, I asked barista which drink it was.  She then told me it was the drink I originally ordered, even though I was told they were out/machine was broken.  Very confusing.  I think barista just didn't know what she was doing.  Customer who ordered after me, also waited longer than usual, but got her drink before I did.

I have absolutely no problem with people training, but at least pair them up with someone who knows what they're doing.

Next time I'm just gonna ask for a voucher for a free drink 'cause it was already 7:30pm, so there's no reason why I'd even need a Blonde Venti."}
{"text":"As far as chain cafés go, this is probably the prettiest Starbucks that I have been in!  It has a warmer feel with vaulted, wood plank ceilings, and industrial style light fixtures.  No comparison to SB found in malls, Chapters/Indigo, Target, or strip plazas.  Particularly nice during the evening!

Warning:  This location is particularly busy during the Summer months with tons of pedestrian traffic!  So prepare yourself to see a line out the door on some days.

Parking:  Slightly difficult to access if you're travelling West on Lakeshore.  Lot is quite small.  Park at the library instead.

Minus a point 'cause it's usually busy, so I personally wouldn't be able to study/read here...unless I was trying to procrastinate OR needed some background noise.  ;)  

Minus another * 'cause there aren't that many comfy seats available.  LOTSA people will bring their laptop, sitting at one of the very few leather armchairs, get up to grab a complimentary water, after their latté is done,...you get the point!  Not SB fault, but prime seating is limited.

Might be ok for a date, but not a first one where you're trying to have an intimate convo!"}
{"text":"As it's a Starbucks, I really can't add too much.  How different/bad/good from other SBs can it be?

Highlights:  Newer Starbucks, more spacious, more seating, tables, conveniently located with ample parking.  Sharing the same lot as a Costco (with gas bar!), Walmart Superstore, Bulk Barn, LCBO, and all the other elements for a good time...in the suburbs!  Plus, the GO is nearby.  

Not sure if this location gets as busy yet, but it was pretty quiet when I dropped by on a Holiday Monday."}
{"text":"Our family goes to Starbucks on a daily basis. This was the worst bar none experience that I have ever had at a Starbucks. Waited over 30 minutes from the start of getting in the drive-through line which was not passed their cemented in the area until I got to the window. Said something to the lady at the window and all she did was make excuses about how they didn't have staff and couldn't help it. I explain to her that it would be a nice benefit if they stuck a sign at the end of their drive through saying sorry shortstaffed long wait times, but only met with excuses. They didn't even offer a free coffee. Did I say 30 minutes to get a couple coffee in a drive through, yes I did!!!! Absolutely ridiculous!!!"}
{"text":"Driving on Lake Mead Boulevard, I saw this Starbuck's, and decided to give it a try. It seems to be an enjoyable Starbucks to hang out in. 
  With an L-shape foot print, the cafe is commodius. It is clean. The Motown music coming out of the speakers was enjoyable.
  The baristas seemed to be extraordinarily personable. I overheard them greet a handful of customers by name."}
{"text":"Starbucks is a corporate chameleon. It can change to whatever environment they are in. The Starbucks in Caesar's Palace is a cafe with a hotel lobby feel.

   While the new Buffet grand opening in Caesar's Palace got all the press, a new Starbucks in the Augustus Tower opened without a word. To this day, Caesar's Palace is keeping their new Starbucks a secret. In a way, it is like finding Secret Pizza in the Cosmopolitan.

  On Saturday, I was exploring around Caesar's Palace when I noticed the iconic Starbucks logo near the elevator bank. I decided on the spot to try it.

  This is a busy Starbucks.  Obviously people who stay in the Augustus Tower enjoy Starbucks. What stood out in my mind is that the seating is a large two sided couch. It is interesting seeing strangers sitting on a couch drinking coffee. On both sides of the couch are wall paintings that celebrate Las Vegas. I said that Starbucks is a corporate chameleon. I uploaded a picture of \"Welcome to Starbucks\" on a copy of the \"Welcome to Las Vegas\" sign. One side of the couch faces the hallway of the Augustus Tower, which could be interesting people watching. The other side faces the counter. At the counter, the baristas were friendly.  Near the counter was a constant line.

   Where the Augustus Tower Starbucks is low on seating capacity, it is high on price. This is the Strip after all.

   As I said Starbucks is a chameleon. I am optimistic that they will change the personality of future stores to fit into other places."}
{"text":"NEWEST VEGAS STARBUCK'S OFF THE STRIP 

  My brother knows that I am a Starbuck's fan. A couple days ago he texted me that they opened a new Starbuck's at Eastern and Tropicana. Fast forward a couple of days when pumpkin spice season is kicking in the cooler weather at Starbuck's, and I was up for checking out the newest Starbuck's off the Las Vegas Strip.

  The newest Starbuck's off the Vegas Strip is located in the Burlington Coat Factory Shopping center. It is so new that it has that new scent you associate with a new car. The asphalt overlays a sundry of parking spaces and drive thru lane. The lobby is commodious with the airport hangar layout. Tables and seats are plentiful and include three plush chairs. Because there are zero west facing windows the annoying sundown glare ought to be nonexistent here.

  I ordered my beloved drip with pumpkin spice syrup. In my opinion, Starbuck's shines with its pumpkin spice beverage line. I don't know why they pass over offering it all year long.

  Word of mouth hasn't spread on the newest Starbuck's off the Las Vegas Strip. The upshot is that it is sparsely populated. The barista was friendly as she answered my questions:

Me: \"How knew is this Starbuck's? \"
Barista: \"We've only been open for a couple of weeks.\"

Me: \"Are they opening any other new Starbuck's? \"
Barista: \"We are pretty saturated in this area. They just opened the Starbuck's in the Grand Bazaar Shops.\"

Me: They just opened the new Starbuck's in the Grand Bazaar Shops (kind of excited)......\"

  What better way to kick in a Holiday's season of drinks with a brand sparkling new Starbuck's. Holding up my cup of drip coffee with pumpkin spice coffee, I am sending an Internet  toast hoping for years of prosperity for the newest Las Vegas Starbuck's off the Las Vegas Strip."}
{"text":"This will be a moderate review or in Starbuck's terminology, a grande review. The best way to summarize the Starbuck's at the southeast corner of Decatur and Charleston Boulevards is BIG ON CONVENIENCE AND SHORT ON COMFORT.

  The location sits at the corner of two hyper-busy Las Vegas highways in a Super Walmart Shopping Center surrounded by fast food places. If you are shopping, eating out, or cruising along eastbound Charleston and north and southbound Decatur (Decatur entrance controlled by a traffic signal) this is a convenient Starbuck's for a caffeine boost.

  This has to be one of the tiniest Las Vegas Starbucks that I have visited. It just isn't very conducive to relaxing. There are only four tables, five counter stools, and a couch; which can fill up quickly in a hyper-busy area. The standard handicap table is nonexistent. On another note, a password combo is necessary to access the rest room. Forget about a drive-thru. It is attached to a Panda Express and Jamba Juice.

  This Starbuck's needs some work to be the third place that it is supposed to be. I would not be surprised if Starbuck's rebuilds this location nearby as a modern third place with a drive-thru.

*This Starbuck's is shown in an incorrect location. I checked into a Decatur Boulevard location that shows this store. Oh well.

The 2013 Yelp 100. Review #160"}
{"text":"\"Sorry, we're out of cold brew\".
Really? It's 6:15am... you probably meant to say \"someone that manages this place is an idiot and doesn't expect the employees prepare the night before for the mornings customers\".
I mean, it's cold brew... you're a Starbucks....
Now I'm stuck in the drive through line and can either sit here and order nothing, wasting 20 minutes of my morning. Or order something I don't want.
This Starbucks must be hiring employees from the McDonald's across the street. You know, the ones that are trained to tell you \"the machine is broken\" when you order a McFlurry.
So... I ended up ordering a Vt Iced Vanilla Latte (in hopes my time wasn't completely wasted) and not even the slightest offer of a discount. But to top it off, the cup wasn't even full. So basically I paid way too much for a grande drink that I didn't want.
Great. Thanks poorly run Starbucks."}
{"text":"Its a starbucks in mile end. Not very spacious but can accomodate a decent amount of people. Summertime you will find people sitting outside on sunny days in their makeshift patio."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try even though the rating was 1.5 stars.

The place was nearly empty since it was the Tuesday before Christmas and the hotel is slow.  

A strange thing happened as I walked in.  One of the girls working had some kind of medical issue as she was waiting on a couple of people.  She suddenly went to the back and fainted.  The whole staff understandably went to the back to check on her and call for help. But the manager was able to split the crew to the wait on the customers and  take care of their down teammate.

So down to the review...

The place is pretty big.  Lots of places to sit and relax with a latte and a gingerbread cookie. WiFi is thru the Venetian Palazzo network.  

Couldn't get a good reading on the staff because of the emergency that I talked about earlier. But the staff seems large and if working well together, should be able to deliver orders quickly and keep the place orderly.

So three out of five stars..."}
{"text":"This is a decent Starbucks in a convenient location. I'm not the biggest fan of the coffee at Starbucks, but I'll still stop by Starbucks once in a while when it's convenient. I generally don't like drinking black coffee so I don't order that here, but a lot of the flavored espresso drinks at Starbucks are also too sweet or too heavy. That said, I do like the tea lattes here and will usually order these with less sweetener. My go to drink is the English breakfast tea latte or sometimes the London Fog tea latte. During the summer, I liked getting the strawberry acai refresher with coconut milk (the pink drink) a lot. I also really like the cranberry bliss bar and will occasionally order this when I want to treat myself haha. 

However, the inconsistency I've experienced here is why I didn't give this Starbucks a higher rating. I've gotten my drinks made wrong a couples times, plus I did not have the cup discount applied to my order the last time I was here (you get $0.10 off your order if you bring your own cup!). Just minor mistakes that I didn't want to bother the busy employees to fix, but the fact that it's happened to me multiple times indicates to me that there is some level of inconsistency here.

I've found the employees here to be generally friendly and efficient, though sometimes it can take a while to get your drink. If you're looking for familiarity and convenience, Starbucks is the place to go, but if you're looking for better quality coffee or better service, I would recommend you go somewhere else. Nevertheless, Starbucks is kind of a classic in terms of coffee haha and I'm sure I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"Located in Planet Hollywood next to the Sex & The City Slot machine game and across from Spice Market. 

I love my coffee."}
{"text":"Beautiful ambiance & seating. Same great coffee."}
{"text":"Convenient Starbucks located on the SE corner of Christie and Dupont. The interior has a lot of that old Toronto charm which is a nice bonus. There is a fair bit of seating but no patio seating. I grabbed some of the sous vide egg bites for breakfast which were heated up and presented with a fork. They were also really quick about it which was great."}
{"text":"Yet again I get more morning craziness at this Starbucks. It's been a week since I was told they were out of some of their oatmeal toppings and that they would order some in. And in that week's time this Starbucks can't seem to get things done. I can get a package from a friend in Kiev, Ukraine sent halfway around the world in 4 days yet Starbucks can't seem to get basic inventory from a warehouse that's less than 500 miles away, if not less in an entire WEEK! I don't get it. So I said so this morning when placing my order. When I get to the main window to pay, the cash register mysteriously went on the fritz, and my entire order got comped. While I love free coffee and breakfast, what I really want is the items I requested. 

Still 1 Star. I can't reward bad inventory control with extra stars."}
{"text":"For a place that sells espresso in the morning this place is SLOW. Do not stop here if you're cutting it close to make it to work on time. The drive thru line may only have 4 cars but it will move at a snail's pace. You look inside and think wow, there's only 2 people in line so you run in only to have to wait while standing instead of sitting in your car. You look at the pastries and the menu board, find your phone and pull up the Starbucks app and just as you get the app ready they are impatiently waiting to take your order. So you tell them what you want, pay up with the app if the scanner works....and then you wait. You daydream about World Peace. Or what your boss is going to say if you walk in late. And then you wake up from your caffeine deficient state and wonder why did the woman that came in after you just get her drink while yours is still waiting? 

When you get your drink you run out the door hoping the NHP or Metro won't be running radar so you can make it to work on time. And you say to your self you're not going to do that again as it really doesn't taste that good. But a couple of mornings later you'll be pulling into the parking lot to do it all again and at least with the app you can keep your Gold Star status.... 

2 Stars. See Jessie B's review. It may be from 2013 but it's still spot on over a year later."}
{"text":"As a senior and member of Green Valley Ranch's slot club, I printed off a coupon at a kiosk good for a free tall coffee on a Wednesday.  There was a long line of seniors in front of me, but the moved quickly as one barista was just pouring coffees.  The coffee was what you expect from Starbucks."}
{"text":"Stopped by this Starbucks yesterday for a shopping break and decided to try the Crystal Ball Frappacino drink.  I was intrigued by the swirly green drink design and the mystical sparkles on the whipped cream on top.  I actually thought it was a mint drink due to the greens swirls but it's actually a peachy flavour !  
I enjoyed it and it made me think of magic & unicorns ... weird .... but I enjoyed this icy cold drink with a hot pretzel at the mall !"}
{"text":"We visited this location out of convenience since it was on our way. It was a definite plus that it also featured a drive-thru. I don't frequent Starbucks often, but I really like the addition of caloric information on the menu. It aided my decision since I wasn't sure what to order. I had forgotten about their \"Skinny\" offering (a quick way to order non-fat milk and sugar-free syrup for their lattes and eliminating many calories), but that's good to remember for future orders. I went with a Tall Iced Soy Caramel Macchiato (180 calories). It was delicious, but about as bad for you as a can of soda (I'll have to remember to ask for sugar-free Vanilla syrup next time). Anyway, the barista that helped us was very nice and we had no problems with our order. It did take some time to get through the drive-thru; I wouldn't have thought it'd be busy at 4PM on a Sunday. I would hate to see this place on a weekday morning!"}
{"text":"This is a nice clean Starbucks I will definitely give it that. But I work an hour away and coffee is a must at 4:20am. I can't tell you how many times I have showed up to get coffee in the morning and the manager is just barely opening the store or not even there yet. I travel to this particular Starbucks on my way out to work because they open, I'm sorry they are SUPPOSED to open at 4 AM... Today was another one of those mornings that I showed up a half hour after the supposed to be open and the managers still not even there. The workers had to come up to my car in the cars behind me and let us know that the opening on time so all in all good location good stuff but the manager need to get their crap together. NOT OOAY. And by the way open at 4 AM means coffee is ready for your customers at 4 AM. Not you're just walking into the store turning on the lights at 4 AM."}
{"text":"No niceties, no thank you's and no you're welcomes. Typically blank stares. These people are way overworked with drive thru, mobile and counter. If you're a walk up customer, expect to get your drink 15 minutes later after all mobile orders and drive thru orders are processed, before during and after you place your order. And, if you're lucky, they'll be so irritatingly busy that a random barista will grab three empty cups, yours included, by sticking his fingers inside them and grabbing them all at once, leaving all that great stuff he's picked up on his hands lingering inside your drink. Good luck! In all fairness to this Starbucks, where all this literally just happened, these days all Starbucks are becoming this way, way too busy, considerably lessening the good feeling I used to have frequenting this corporation's establishments."}
{"text":"I love Starbucks like everyone else but this one just need more employees we are in Las Vegas people not in some dead part of town there was 15 people ahead of me for coffee which I expected but you would expect more from Starbucks four stars because their coffee is still great"}
{"text":"I needed a place to hang out while waiting on my husband to land at the airport. I brought a book, found a seat in the back, and am enjoying an ice cold Frap on an ice cold day. 
The baristas here are all very friendly. They are smiling and being so kind to everyone. The store is spotless. It's a great space to work, read, or hang with a friend."}
{"text":"Tried a Caramel Macchioto. It was really good!  The line was long and I thought it would take awhile but the staff was moving people along nicely. It ended up being a very short wait to give my order and then to receive my drink. It was 80 degrees out and my coffee was super refreshing."}
{"text":"I love that they built this Starbucks! I pretty much live right across the street so this has made my morning run a lot easier; plus, unlike other Vegas locations, this location almost never has a line. Even if there are a few cars in the drive through, I normally only have to wait a few minutes as opposed to close to 10 like the other locations.

The baristas that I have interacted with are friendly and efficient; however, be on the alert because they're human and can make mistakes too. Today I went to get my half off frappe for Starbucks members and almost had to pay full price until I clarified; another time I almost got the wrong order when going through the drive through but luckily noticed in time.

Will definitely be visiting here a couple times a week!"}
{"text":"I really like coming to this location, especially after a long day of shopping at Sherway Gardens. There's something about this location that makes me feel so relaxed. I like how they have bar tables/stools near the front of the store to make use of the space and sunlight. There are also a few high tables and some round tables as you walk further into the store. Definitely a spacious starbucks, but I can see how busy it can get during peak hours and/or weekends. 

When I got there today, I was served by 2 kind baristas. They both had a smile on their faces and were friendly. I liked that they were also very flexible with my orders even when I had to change it midway. 

I was quite satisfied with this location, so I'll definitely come back here next time to get my usual java chip frappicino after shopping"}

It's a really convenient location for me since there are no much coffee shops in the East. 
There is plenty of parking since it's the same parking lot as the IGA next door.

I love their pumpking latte special for fall !!! 

It gets quite busy on nights and on week-ends, often there are no sitting place for 2.

Today, Tuesday October 11th 2016, at 3 PM, there is no table available (I do have a sitting place with a table!)"}

{"text":"I saw on a buzzfeed article recently that this is the busiest Starbucks in all of Nevada. I have to say I'm impressed by the dedication and hard work that all of the baristas put in at this location. There can be times when this place gets chaotic and hectic but considering how many drinks they are pumping out everyday they are doing a great job! I know they don't have a lot of time to make conversation but when they are able to they are always friendly and considerate. I've even noticed an increase of business in this location especially due to mobile orders and even though they are incredibly busy, they always try to be prompt and get the order right."}
{"text":"An above average Starbucks. Easy parking, no line to wait, quickly served, several places to sit, a lot of power outlets and free WiFi. Everyone was friendly here from the staff to the customers."}

{"text":"This unicorn frap thingy is so overrated. It tastes so artificial. Not sure why Starbucks would have this on their menu. It's like a mixture of blended ice mixed with sour and more sour and artificial...that's the best way I can describe it."}
{"text":"Please!! Somebody from the company, needs to address the situation of this place, NOT CLEAN, 
is just nasty, all the water every where, when they deliver your drink with their nasty hands, the leave the mark of their work behind, need a big restructure in terms of not just personnel from the floor level, but also from managers.
Floors inside and out are dirty, garbage rarely emptied, work stations and coffee delivery station dirty and lots of nasty water everywhere.
Please, this needs to change or to stop."}
{"text":"probably the worst drive thru ever.

about 3/5 times they dont answer you at the speaker box. and i understand some drinks take long, but it's to the point where i can be waiting a good 10-15 mins for a latte or even a coffee and then i get it cold.

you can tell drive thru is not the priority. better to park and go inside."}
{"text":"EVERYTIME I go to only THIS starbucks my drink is ALWAYS wrong! Then they argue with me because they made it right but it doesn't look correct AT ALL. Don't argue with your customers make them a new drink. 
I normally get a green tea lemonade, pretty simple right?! Well not for this store specifically is ALWAYS wrong with my drink and today I watched them make it. They NEVER even measured my drink in the shaker how they are supposed to they just eye balled it into my cup, so it was also not shaken up how its supposed to be! This starbucks is the only one who CAN NOT get this SIMPLE drink down"}
{"text":"I really enjoy studying at this Starbucks location any chance I get! The drinks are always consistent (I usually only order like 3 different items on the menu) compared to other locations, which I love. The employees are very organized especially since they do get busy and also have to worry about a drive thru. Some locations do not have a drive thru and they are a mess. Workers are always cleaning and making sure that the lobby is clean.

The bathrooms are also really clean which is a plus. I love that there are stalls rather than just one toilet overall. 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Its a pretty standard Starbucks. The set up is a little harder than usual to navigate. You place your order pretty far into the location, and recieve your order in the same area. The coffee cream/sugar area is all the way by the entrance so you have to carry your coffee a long way to add your accompaniments.. Otherwise friendly staff and a few seats/bench available for sitting. Can get busy around rush hours because its located directly across from the subway."}
{"text":"This Starbucks is by far the worst one I have been too. I dread coming here because the coffee just isn't the same as the other Starbucks I go to. I ask for extra extra extra Carmel drizzle because I already know that my coffee is going to taste like dirty water so the Carmel helps, and of course every time I get my coffee there is NO Carmel. Someone needs to come in and retrain the employees here."}
{"text":"Not sure what it was about this location, but it didn't stand out for me.

Very busy (which is a good thing for the owner), but staff seemed to be unhappy and/or robotic.  Not rude, just robotic which is no surprise given the huge volume of people coming in and out.

The baked goods (and I am a baked goods junkie big time) did not appeal to me nor did it whet my appetite in any way.

This is a place to get your cup of joe, and leave (advertising your Starbucks cup)."}

Been to tons of Starbucks and as always they are forever busy. Even though they are always busy starbucks customer service is always perfect. Even with my girlfriends complicated order they are always on point."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Starbucks to get coffee from.  No matter how long the line is, my wait is never long.   They have people take my drink order, separate people to ring me up, and other people to make the drinks.  On the very rare occasion that my drink order is messed up, I have always been compensated with a free drink.  The staff is always very friendly, even when they line is long.  I used to go in there nearly every day but since I changed jobs I only go in about 3-4 times a month.  Everyone still remembers me and my favorite drink.  It is also always clean in there and the pastry case is well stocked."}
{"text":"There are Starbucks and then there's the big-one-in-the-lobby-of-the Omni-Starbucks. This is a breed apart from your typical downtown run of the mill Starbucks and for good reason - it takes up a big corner of one the largest downtown hotels. A recent renovation has given the Omni Starbucks a patina of European glamour... this looks more like something you'd find in Vienna than Pittsburgh. The design team has come in and cleaned out all of the old predictable Starbucks furniture and given it a new elegant shine that highlights the classic architecture of the building with it's elegant molding looking better than ever. Now, if only something could be done about the Truman-era lobby of the Omni William Penn Hotel and you might have something. In any event, this is the downtown destination Starbucks for those who like their coffee in really nice looking Starbucks."}
{"text":"As a former Sbux barista, I know the job can be taxing especially when it's busy so I usually cut baristas some slack. That being said, this is the WORST sbux location I have EVER been too. Painfully slow, not friendly, lack of menu knowledge, forgetful...I could literally go on and on. You can tell the employees are not happy especially since this location has one of the highest turnover rates in the city! There is someone new there almost every week and there are always grossly undertrained. I know it's great to treat your regulars like family but if you are not one of the four men that go there every single day and sit there for hours, these baristas do not care about you. This location is walking distance from my home so I go there out of convenience (and fairly often I hate to admit) I order regular coffee and not one of them remembers my name or my drink. Just a bad experience overall every time I go there. I'm going to start driving the 10/15 minutes out my way just to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went in this morning and asked for a breakfast sandwich and I had to wait because they had just started their oven. They had been open for 20 minutes and I didn't even have any other food options (empty case and refrigerated empty) laid out yet so I had to skip breakfast. I left my house early so I had time to eat but no food for me. I also ordered a green tea with no classic. The cashier did her job right and my drink was labeled no classic. When I got to work and tried my tea it definitely had classic in it. Thanks for wasting my time this morning, the vending machine at work is being more helpful and took less of my day."}
{"text":"You know from this one experience I can say I was thrown off. Usually it's $2 and some change for my venti coffee. Not today, $5.14. Wow. Wow. Wow. Couldn't believe I paid that but I had a very important meeting at 6am and needed my caffeine boost.  It was piping hot which was nice, but filled to the top so it kept leaking out of the peep hole. Other than that, I'm glad I used my gift card balance or else I would have just waited for the VIP lounge to open to get my free coffee :("}
{"text":"I never give this Starbucks a chance because it's always so busy. But today I had some time to spare. I'm glad I did.. It was a great visit, the guy at the drive threw was so nice, the guy at the drive threw had me laughing the whole time I waited for my coffee! Give you guys 5 stars definitely.

It all makes sense now and I'm completely disgusted. Stay away!"}
{"text":"This Starbucks is located on the Promenade level at the Aria. It seems like it's owned by the Aria with a Starbucks franchise as employees are wearing a Starbucks apron over their black Aria shirt with an Aria name tag. Some of the staff wear latex gloves while making drinks?!?

The line tends to be long so the entire process can take ~15 minutes from start to finish.

I got a tall pike roast, no need to go crazy this late in the day.  The coffee is OK, kind of watery though, but the friendliness of the barista excellent.  They remodelled within the last few months, and its not so nice anymore.  They did away with the comfy chairs with the flat, wood arm rests which were perfect to set your coffee on.  The new decor is very spartan. And hard - in fact, I think I'll sit in my comfy car to finish this review."}

{"text":"Although I feel that I am definitely in the majority, I will admit that I have never been a huge fan of Starbucks. I have always been more of a Dunkin' Donuts girl myself. (Their coffee just tastes better, sorry!) However, I was gifted many Starbucks gift cards from my students for Christmas (shocking, right?). As much as I wish I could trade them for DD money, I looked up my closest Starbucks in an effort to use the cards. I have passed this Starbucks many times and have always thought this to be the worst location. However, upon closer inspection, I discovered that there is much more parking than I first thought, and a drive thru (score!).  
     I came here at about 7 am on a Wednesday and went through the drive thru. The was short and moved quickly. I ordered a black coffee (boring, I know) and a sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich. The food was nothing to write home about, but the coffee was standard. The girl at the drive thru window was exceptionally friendly and made my early morning trip pleasant. Overall, my point is that looks can be deceiving. Don't count this location out because of what it looks like!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, I wasn't aware that just because I'm in Vegas that the prices were automatically doubled. But apparently this is so. My normal medium 2+pump no water, skim hot Chai which is $4.23 here, was $7.56 there. *whut?* Yea.. that was the one and only chai I got while in vegas."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this Starbucks it takes forever. The drive thru is so disorganized and the employees are not friendly at all. If you're ever in a hurry and just want to grab a cup of coffee, avoid this one. I recently swing by to order cold brew and it wasn't until I got to the window that they told me they didn't have any. Destiny, the drive thru barista, did not apologize or offer a substitution and didn't even say \"thank you.\" This is not an uncommon interaction with anyone at this location. It's really disappointing."}
{"text":"I originally reviewed this Starbucks thinking it was the 19th ave and baseline location. My bad."}
{"text":"I usually use the drive thru at this location and never have any issues with service. Michael in the drive thru is always happy to take your order! 

Inside counter service .. everyone is so busy or pretending to be that you're rarely greeted when you're waiting in line .. if you're a mobile order you're never acknowledged. 

Indoor and outdoor seating ., located in Sprouts shopping center."}
{"text":"This location is usually pretty busy since it's in the mall, so expect for wait at least 5 minutes for your drink. Much longer wait on weekends. I normally order a Flat White, but through the summer I've really been enjoying the new Toasted Coconut Cold Brew. Most if the flavored drinks at Starbucks are too sweet for me, but this one has a nice balance between earthy & sweet. It comes with coconut milk, but I like it better with 2% because I think the coconut milk makes it too watery & I prefer a creamy texture with my iced coffee."}
{"text":"I usually go to the 24/7 Starbucks on Eastern and 215 to study, but I prefer this location more than that one for several reasons. I definitely like how almost all of the seating areas are chairs (with the exception of two lounge couches). Also, I like the customer service, how the baristas always makes my drink right, and how not a lot of people come here, which is great if you're looking to study at a coffee shop like this one. At the 24/7 location, I absolutely cannot deal with how loud it can be. It's to the point that I can hear peoples' conversations, even though I am listening to EDM music with my Beats and let me tell you, the music I listen to is pretty loud. The only down side to it is it's not a huge place, but overall, I enjoy being here."}
{"text":"I dislike Starbucks...a lot... I'm biased being Colombian and knowing what good café, good customer service, and reasonable prices is really like....BUT THIS STARBUCKS!!! Holy smokes...

Da Coffee: 3/5 this is nothing special just basic coffee, many times it taste like it was made ages ago. It honestly depends who is working that day. 

Da Food: 3/5 considering it is all microwaveable food you aren't really getting great product. Sometimes the fruit taste fresh and other times it taste old, same could be said for all the refrigerated stuff. I do like the bagels and cake pops.

Customer Service: 0/5 It is never consistent and when they get it bad they get it reaaaallll bbbaaadddd. There has been times when I'm sitting at the window and I get my stuff but they just left me there, didn't say \"thank you, you are good, or have a nice day\" nothing, by the time the girl opened the window she was like \"yeah can I help you?\" then the other day my wife got a bagel, toasted, with cream cheese to go on the app. I ran in grabbed the bagel, it was not toasted, no big deal I'll eat it like that, then I realize that there was no cream cheese, I stand there wait till I see that there is an opening say excuse me, two girls stop look up and then get back to work...Cool, they are busy I get it, I wait till they finish the drinks they are working on, I again say excuse me, this time one only looks up and then goes back to work. This time I had enough, I bellow \"excuse me please\" so that everybody in the store hears me, a girl answer \"how can I help you?\" I tell her I have no cream cheese, she gets me one. She then ask me if I even ordered it , to which I reply yes, she then wants to give me attitude and finally hands me my cream cheese...These are just two occasions that pop to the top of my head, there has been many more...

Da Wait: 1/5 if there is more then one car in the drive thru expect to be there forever!!! They are so slow!!! We have waited over 30 minutes before.

Da Good: Customer and paying it forward. 

Da Bad: Super long wait times, always mess up the drinks, and attitude galore!!!

Da Ugly: The people that work here are pieces of poo!!! Not all of the but a lot of them...they act like us as customers should feel honored that these people are serving us.

Overall: I dislike starbucks a lot, they mess up the drinks, they give lots of attitude and they are way to expensive...save your money go to a mom and pop shop...

PS: I don't spend money here, I refuse. My wife gets lots of Starbucks gift cards...this is the only reason I go here....

PSS: southern highlands we are getting a dutch brothers!!!!"}

{"text":"REALity at Starbucks just got REAL !! I ordered a venti very berry hibiscus with no ice & person who prepped it gave me a half filled venti cup ... I asked why that was & he explained that it was going to be how much drink will be in the cup if it actually had ice in it. He even asked if I normally go to that same store, I have been in the same store couple of times & never got half filled cup when I order my drink with no ice. But really ?! Why should it matter which Starbucks ? He continued to ask his sup to explain and she said the same thing bout how the cup wouldn't b full as I opted no ice. She continued to say I have to pay a trenta price to fill the cup. I did pay trenta price, 54cents more to fill venti as I dint want a half filled cup( like it would make Starbucks so much BIGGER as it is now with difference of 54cents . I rarely want ice in my drink even at home,  also dilutes the drink, harder to melt honey in icy drinks, I prefer I add honey myself most of the time. I had initially told cashier Alex fr the very beginning reason why I didn't want ice in it after the other person who actually prepped the drink had to clarify that I really wanted no ice but ice shaken. He recapped no ice but shaken I corrected him that I wanted ice shaken just no ice in it, as I'm actually taking it to work the next day & would take a couple of sips on my way home. OMG ... now this 54cents up-charge started this novel...though reason shouldn't matter - why no ice ! Even the mobile app has options of how much ice one would want in their drink & imagine getting your cup half empty. When u pull up the drive thru  good thing I had a couple of hour-yoga sessions & a Zumba class couple o days ago--ohmmm.  
I'm sure this will not get Starbucks go out of business. just a bad experience for myself .. should there be motive to customers /small print on the menu in stores & app that say your cup will not b full depending on how much ice u prefer in your drink.. I go to Starbucks almost every other day, been in over a decade here in vegas... there's always a first time ... if It's one of Starbucks rules, make it a known practice in every store"}
{"text":"I had a good experience here on a recent Saturday morning. Not much of a line, and I got my order fast enough to still make my hair appointment. Parking leaves something to be desired, and looked like they could use some more interior tables, but the staff was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I frequent this location at least every other day. The drive thru is fast, friendly, and accurate. When I go into to order they get my order wrong every single time, never fails. They seem to always have new people training on the inside."}
{"text":"Grew up near this Starbucks ! I'm so glad they made a bigger location where the old Taco Bell was and now with a drive thru !"}
{"text":"During travels all over the country, I general will stop by Starbucks for coffee.  This location provided the absolute worst service I have seen at a Starbucks.  I waited twenty minutes in a line, as they generally did not seem to know how to manage the serving of drinks, nor did they care.  If you are staying at the Aria, definitely find another spot for coffee."}
{"text":"Droped in cause i needed a set!  Many people working,  Clean and nice. 

NOTE outside setting you can only use if you are a customer.  The tables were very dirty - not wiped off!   

Serves were nice and ok!    I found the internewt a bit slow at the time i was in the store!  

Would return again!"}
{"text":"There are things in our day to day journey that go unnoticed, as it becomes redundant and non exciting. One of which is getting a cup of coffee... Starbucks is as good as the next Franchise, expect the obvious and leave with your daily dose of caffeine and carry on with your life. 
Today was not like the other days. This location in particular has the most random and creepy costumers who choose to tackle you to get to the napkins. Keep in mind there are two stations and zero traffic. One individual managed to reach for a sandwich through my legs and we were the only ones in line. FIFA fever maybe? I would've been slapped with a red card if I chose to knee his face but I gracefully stepped on his foot instead with all my 5'0 ft power as I waited for his reaction. Zilch! No emotion... There must be a psychiatric ward nearby and I've come face to face with their super star in desperate need of quality coffee to go with his meds!! 
I'm not in a hurry to return anytime soon..."}
{"text":"We went all over town for the unicorn  drink for my little one. And it was all sold out but this Starbucks. I didn't catch his name but he was the only one there yesterday 4-20-17  evening and had a lot of customer for that new drink. He was so nice and  he just got everything done with a good attitude & good customer service regardless of how much people he had in line. Thank you I appreciate you customer service. That's how it should be. The owner did a good job by hiring people like him."}
{"text":"This is one of the more spacious Starbucks in the area very enjoyable staff and a very clean restaurant in fact I think they've won the regional Starbucks clean restaurant award several times."}
{"text":"My favorite Starbucks! They always get my complicated drink order correct. :) They are friendly and efficient, I go here between 3-5 days a week."}
{"text":"First off, I really hate writing negative reviews. I've worked in the service industry and I truly understand the struggle to make customers walk away happy. However I have lived in southern highlands for over a year and have battled with my feelings toward this particular Starbucks. I have never seen such a lack of consideration towards other people's time. It's astonishing that this drive through and store have lines that take over 20 min with 4-5 cars. Something is fundamentally wrong here. Management needs to really take a hard long look at the training for the staff. There is absolutely no sense of urgency, some of the drive through baristas are cold and rude. There are much higher volume stores on the strip and all around vegas that can get orders out the door in less than half the time that this particular branch can. So this review is for the management team, something needs to change and it starts with you. If a manager can't inspire and encourage team members to take pride in their jobs and be motivated, it may be time to reconsider the service industry. Management sets the tone for the team, and clearly it's not working. Don't let your team down and continue to get poor ratings."}
{"text":"This is a fairly new SB I believe in the same plaza as Trader Joe's and the almost closed Kmart. I have Had pretty good service until this afternoon thru the drive thru. No enthusiasm whatsoever. I don't like when people are rushing me through my order when clearly I am not done yet. Geez- it's frustrating . She kept cutting me off and interrupting me. Annoying ...

Went up to the window to pay still- Zero personality. Maybe she's new but it doesn't take any training to be customer service oriented. Some Need a week training in that. I remember saying to myself as I left the window 'wow, great service ( sarcastically) and SB is known for cherry service- argh!! Disappointed"}
{"text":"Fat dude at the window in the am
Is super slow and super rude .. & when I tip them he never says thank you ."}
{"text":"Typical franchise... nothing outstanding. The staff was friendly and condiments area was clean and stocked."}
{"text":"The inside is very nice and seems like a nice place to pop open your computer and work. I have had a bad experience with iced coffee drinks at this location. They fill the ice to the top so you get like 2 drinks of coffee. I would recommend getting a hot drink at this location to get more coffee. The drive through is hit or miss. Today, thur I waited around 20 minutes at around 820 am which is probably their busy time. The inside can take just as long or even longer depending on the day. Sometimes I will go inside and check the drive though and find myself seeing vehicles go by that I would have been behind."}
{"text":"Able to find seats even during busy lunch hour. Good amount of parking spaces at the back and close to major intersection. Drinks are made promptly. Great Starbucks!"}
{"text":"Not the best starbucks but does the job. It's a bit on the small side and can get quite busy during lunch hours, which means it is hard to get a spot. It does improve in warmer weathers when outside seating is also available.

I have also experienced the rare occasion here where the barista messed up my drink, which is disappointing. MY tip here is to check your drink before you leave."}
{"text":"A small Starbucks inside Chapters/Indigo

Very limited seating, but does the job. For mobile orders this location is not as \"on the ball\" as others, so expect to wait a tad longer.

The fact that there is no outdoor view and the commotion of being inside a bookstore may be irksome"}
{"text":"Out of all the Starbucks in the area, this is definitely the most spacious. There's over a dozen tables in which groups can sit together and work. In addition, I would say that the space allows them to be more creative with their interior design which results in one of the better looking Starbucks in the area.

Due the extra space, they seem to have a good inventory of snacks and merchandise if that's your type of thing. 

On the bad side, I did find that the floors weren't the cleanest and there weren't any toilet paper in the men's bathroom.

I would defintely recommend this location over the others in the area when it comes to a place to sit and do work.

{"text":"A nice Starbucks that accepts mobile payments, unlike the other location further down Mont-Royal. Sweet n' Low loyalists beware though- they don't carry the pink packets here. Only Equal and Splenda."}
{"text":"How can all Starbucks be exactly the same, yet so different at the same time?

This is one of those Starbucks. The drinks, food and service are all exactly as you'd expect. So what makes this Starbucks different? It has to be the location. 

Soccer moms in athletic gear, older couples on the way to the country club and business types grabbing a quick cup o' joe before heading in to work. 

There are never less than 5 dogs/strollers the size of cars hanging out around the door. There is always at least one child inappropriately dressed for playtime, but perfectly dressed for child model stardom. 

Who should frequent this Starbucks?
- Those trying to speed up their approval to the Polo Club. Ladies who lunch. Strapping lads looking to bag an older woman. 

Who should avoid it?
- Generation Y'ers looking to study, get work done or hang out. Those who don't own high end athletic gear and don't appreciate a good blowout."}

So happy that there's finally a drive thru location on my way too work. This isn't a location that has an inside seating area but that's ok, there's a few others around that do offer that. 

Today was there official opening day and to say I got my drink and food quickly and efficiently. So excited to make this location my new regular stop!"}

{"text":"This location is always out of just about everything and takes an exceptionally LONG time for anything.

{"text":"I hate going to this Starbucks, but it's not at fault - the -2 stars is for the huge, stupid lineup.
It's just always SO DANG BUSY. Maybe because it's in the mall food court...I don't know, but if I go here, I'm waiting in line for at least 10 minutes which, if you're carrying shopping bags, feels like hours. 

That aside, the staff are polite and courteous, and they've just also added new little treats that are to die for....
Red Velvet schmoopies or some other silly name....its basically two small red velvet cakes with cream cheese icing in the middle. HELLO! Red Velvet is amazing, and I'm so glad it's becoming more well known. They also have cake pops, which is a ball of cake on a stick with firm icing coating it. Holy crap, they are yumville. I've only tried the birthday cake flavour, which is the most popular I was told.
The prices for all these cute treats isn't bad either....it was something like 2 for $3. 
I am not a huge java lover....but I'll go back for these fun snacks."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed with quality and service. I went to this Starbucks this morning for a coffee around 9am. Yes, I realize it was rush but there are some inexcusable problems. The first, I waited at the register for 10 minutes to order while two baristas talked to each other, not making drinks or helping customers. Second, when I ordered my drink they didn't ask for my name so it wasn't clear which drink was mine. Third, the quality of the items in the shop. In the image it shows extremely bruised bananas labeled as fresh. I understand bananas are easily bruised but if a supermarkets bananas can look nice so can a Starbucks.

The matter only got worse when my drink was being made. I watched individuals who ordered after me get their drinks. Eventually after 15 minutes I asked about my drink and the barista went \"Oh I forgot to give your ticket.\" 

Sadly it wasn't even put to the front of the line and I had to wait even longer. When I did get my tall drink it wasn't even completely filled and was only about half way full of the drink."}
{"text":"Starbucks is always great. I really enjoy the salted caramel hot chocolate. Going mid afternoon is the best because the cafe is least busy..late at night I would say after 9PM is also very nice. This location doesn't have as much seating as the one just north of it, but for the summer they have a patio and the other one doesn't. But they allow smoking out there....gross"}
{"text":"It's a beautiful Starbucks located inside the Omni William Penn Hotel. Called ahead to ask the barista to set aside two of the Pittsburgh mugs for me (I know, so touristy). They were there waiting for me when I came in.
The service was fast and friendly.  Ordered a Very Berry Hibiscus with light ice and it was made well. Some SBX I go to make them taste so watered down."}
{"text":"This is a big store. Friendly efficient staff. Great atmosphere. But man took almost 15 minutes for a handcrafted drink. They need more baristas"}
{"text":"Like any other Starbucks, consistent coffee, friendly staff, inviting environment. What's different is this is one of the two strip Starbucks that doesn't drastically inflate their prices to pay for high strip rents. The Other one is at Fashion Show Mall. 

Located in a cool little area of the Forum Shops."}
{"text":"I left this Starbucks extremely upset and insulted by the (FEMALE WITH GLASSES) barista/cashier that helped my boyfriend and I. As I am from California, I am not aware that I cannot order a Caramel Macchiato \"upside down\" here in Alberta. The barista informed me with extreme attitude and I was quite insulted. Also- misheard me with my order of how many I wanted and in what size. I don't normally have a short tempter. I also come from a strong customer service background and felt the need to go out of my way to write this review on how horrible this service was here. I visit Calgary quite often and love this city. But I WILL NEVER go to this Starbucks again."}
{"text":"Just your average neighborhood Starbucks as it should be - alright baristas, chill ambiance, and quality crafted beverages. Not terribly fond of the seating layout. Though its a spacious cafe the seating is somewhat awkward. Unlike other locations, theres no air of welcome to ask to sit at a table occupied by 1 person when the restaurants tight for seating. A big plus is the drive-through that has always made my order spot-on.

Located at Westney and Kingston plaza with a grocery store, banks, Shoppers, and fast food places in throwing distance."}
{"text":"Not a good experience at this location. They don't accept the Starbucks app, the prices are not posted for food items etc., and the coffee prices are all about 1/3 higher than typical."}
{"text":"Love coming to this location! It's inside Safeway. The baristas are always friendly to me :)"}
{"text":"I had spent three hours walking around Sherway Gardens and needed a drink to quench my thirst. I saw a sign saying that Starbucks was up ahead. I went with it.

Although Starbucks is connected to the mall, you actually have to walk outside to get into the cafe. I find that bizarre and a tad inconvenient when you are hauling a ton of purchases with you. I am glad that it was also a mild winter day. This physical setup seems odd.

I ordered an iced green tea. Service was fast and friendly. My barista liked that I said thanks to her.

The free wifi works well. My iced green tea hit the spot.

Quality and service are wonderful here. I just think that the cafe should consider a door entrance from the cafe to the mall."}
{"text":"I had a short staycation in Mississauga this weekend. I had checked out of my hotel and wanted to try a Starbucks with a drive-thru. This one was the closest to me. 

Of course, being a tourist in a city that I work in (it is more Malton, so I know the east part of Mississauga a bit better), I completely missed my turn into the same area where there is a Best Buy. 

I find that it is hit or miss placing my order at a Starbucks store. I ordered a grande no whip, green tea, soy frappuccino. The barista repeated what she thought that I had said. She missed the soy part, which is crucial for a borderline lactose-intolerant person. She quoted my order at $5.86, which I knew was wrong. 

At the counter, another barista indicated that my order was $6.40. I pointed out the price discrepancy. She explained that soy costs more. I told her that I knew that, so why was the quote cheaper earlier? It turns out that the other barista changed my order for a latte. Huh? Where did a latte come into play?!

I swear that some baristas either aspire to be fiction writers or need help with listening skills. My order was finally correct. 

I find that mobile order is better under some situations. Custom orders like mine is such a situation.

{"text":"I have been visiting this location for three years. I visit when I'm in Whitby to do some shopping at the outlets. 

I would say that it has been half a year since my last experience. Things have changed for the worst. 

Today, I went through the drive-thru. I ordered a grande unsweetened passion tango tea. The barista got my order correct, so I was pleased. 

Well, he handed me the drink with it dripping down my left hand. He did manage to get me napkins. How about mopping up the mess before giving it to a customer?!

I proceeded to wipe around the beverage cup and my hand. I placed the beverage in my car cup holder and used another napkin to soak up the beverage on top of the lid. 

The straw given to me in the paper wrapper was wet. I gave it back and used a clean, dry one in my car. There was so much ice that it was difficult to stick the straw in my beverage. I told him that this exercise was ridiculous. 

When my beverage finally stopped dripping, I placed my wet napkins and straw wrapper in an empty Starbucks cup that I had finished earlier in the day, closed the lid, told that barista that \"this [cup] is for you,\" left it on the drive-thru ledge, and left. 

At least two baristas need training on how to properly fill an iced beverage in a cup and how to wipe up a beverage in such a state before presenting it to a customer."}
{"text":"Starbucks is my happy little place despite being extremely commercialized, mechanized and impersonal. 

As much as I wish to say that I only frequent hip, trendy, small local cafes, I must say that I love Starbucks. Regardless of which country I am in- Taiwan, Canada, the States, I can always find respite underneath the vacant stare of the green Siren. 

So yes, this is a confession. Like countless other people, I have been seduced by the coax of overpriced coffee, sitting at one of those tiny brown tables with an Apple laptop, sipping on bland brewed coffee, measuring my life away in coffee spoons. 

Now, onto this actual branch. 
It's located right across Fairmont Royal York and Union Station on University and Front. It seats around 40 people, and has an open patio. It is one of the larger Starbucks branches I have seen in the city. I like this Starbucks because of the crowd it attracts. I would say most people are tourists, waiting to get onto sightseeing buses to tour the city. 
There is one long table that is perfect for work. Staff is friendly. Thumbs up for the location, crowd and convenience."}
{"text":"Spacious coffee shop, large room away from the order area, Wi-Fi works fine. Various people have worked there since the opening and the staff is always very friendly. Service also got a lot faster. Front terrace in the shade, which is nice, but not super relaxing facing busy McGill Street."}
{"text":"This Starbucks is kinda small and doesn't have many seats. Two people were hogging 2 tables and 4 chairs so that doesn't leave much room for other people. The food is the same as other Starbucks locations. They share a washroom with the restaurant next door. Service was fine. Not much else to note about this location."}
{"text":"Everyone here is great.
The coffee is great.
The service is great.
The staff are more than great.
Daniel is handsome.

I love coming here for MY Starbucks coffee.

Perfectly made every time."}
{"text":"Do not trust their opening hours on the weekend. Though they are MEANT to open at 7am, I have found myself there with other puzzled members of the public waiting outside when the doors are locked and no one is there."}
{"text":"Service: 4
Decor: 4
Drinks: 3


This location recently re-opened because they were closed for renovation. It's much more bigger with many seats and the wait time is quicker because they have many barristers to take your order.

However, the drinks haven't met my expectations. Compared to the Dynamic Funds building, their drinks are less bitter but there's still some consistency problem. My favorite drinks are latte and flat white. 

Latte
- less bitter but not too sweet
- extremely foamy
- I always order Tall, but I don't know why the weight feels \"lighter\" 90% of the time? They don't put the same amount?

Flat white
- bitter 
- foamy
- fail to give me the \"white dot\" so I end up paying more for a \"latte\" because of the extra foam.

I always see new barristers and it seems like they rush through the drinks, which is not a good sign."}
{"text":"This location is super slow. I have been here a few times and it's been a carbon copy of the last. 

I have never gone through the drive thru but I'm sure they cater to the window first and maybe this is a prime reason for the slow walk in experiences. 

I now have a workaround and just go across the street to the frys Starbucks inside which has been much quicker and I haven't had any issues (friendly staff as well)."}
{"text":"This Starbucks is great!! They really take their customers time into consideration... I waited about two minutes for a mobile order and they handed me a gift card for my next drink! They wanted to be sure that I knew they appreciated my wait and didn't feel that was the norm there. 
Great customer service!!!!"}
{"text":"What can I say... Starbucks is quality coffee and specialty drinks. I always get their soy latte and have yet to be disappointed. This location is pretty busy but they are friendly, the service is decent and they try their best to get you your drink quickly. The only one thing I wish Starbucks had was Almond milk!"}
{"text":"This drive thru location is great. 
1) There is never a long wait, 
2) the staff are super friendly and helpful
3) they've never messed up my order.
I've never eaten outside or gone inside, but there is a cute seating area outside and I always see people sitting out there.
The ONLY thing stopping them from receiving 5 stars from me is the challenge leaving the parking lot to turn back west on Shea. There's no wait in the drive thru, but there's like 4-5 cars deep waiting to exit the lot to turn onto Shea. Ugh. It sure would be nice if there was a back alley to get you to the 40th St and Shea stop light quickly."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Starbucks location of all! I don't mind the long walk from Yonge and Eglinton, as long as I can get my peaceful space for the afternoon with a cup of coffee and a sweet treat or two. The baristas here are always warm and friendly, and more importantly they get my coffee right every time! It's spacious and you'll always find a seat to get down to business. Also, washrooms are kept considerably clean. I love studying and reading here for hours. Even if I live in the west end, this particular Starbucks branch is like second home to me."}
{"text":"Faster service doesn't always mean better service.   Unfortunately, my last iced coffee was all cream (extra was not requested).  Please ensure drinks are made appropriately.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"This Starbucks is clean, spacious and surprisingly, not busy. It's a typical neighbourhood coffee place, attracting local traffic (located 1km from Yonge & Eglinton will do that).  There's nothing that sets it apart from other Starbucks. It's a good place to pick up a tea before heading to Nailsense, as Mariko commented below; I do the same exact thing."}
{"text":"Closed under the guise of 'renovation' at the moment, this Starbucks was a necessary evil in Chinook Centre; it was a central location (in front of Zellers), and hence was under a constant deluge of patrons and slowpokes. This stream worked its magic on the baristas over time; short tempers, zero interaction, frequent mistakes, and steadily declining quality control. 

During the busy season, it is nearly impossible to get a coffee without wasting a quarter of your break: God help you if you only have 15 minutes at 4pm! I have stood in line for ten minutes to place an order, and waited a further 5-10 minutes for my drink to arrive on several occasions, and because I value the time I can spend NOT working, I had to make do with getting their rotating line-up of simple brews. 

After a typically long wait a couple of months ago, I ordered a tall brew, which costs $1.90 after tax.
Barista: \"$2.10\".
Gabe: \"Are you sure? I believe the tall is $1.75 plus tax\".
Barista: \"No it's $2.10\".
Gabe: \"Well, I am looking at the sign above you and I can read it without my glasses - a tall brew is $1.75. Could you have punched it in wrong?\"
Barista: \"It's $2.10.\"
Gabe: \"*inarticulate grumbling under breath, clearly masking some severe language* just give me the drink.\"
Barista\" \"NEXT\"

I am not necessarily a stickler for 20 cents, but it is the principle of the matter, the dismissive attitude and utter disregard for basic service. And I was being polite, I can only imagine what an outspoken person would say if confronted by this kind of situation. I highly doubt the renovations can fix the surly service and subpar drinks. Blacklisted!

{"text":"It took 15 minutes for a simple cup of coffee, with 4 people behind the counter and three customers. Finally get my coffee and it turns out to be cold leftover from last night. That's right they put it right back out.  When I told the barista she just moved on to the next customer, so I told them to keep the money. They ripped me off."}
{"text":"NOT worth any star...BAD service and bad attitude ...what is happening with Starbucks staff? Please just request a day off if you dont want to work on Christmas. The lady was ok but the guy ignored me and just stared at me. I hope he is not discriminated."}
{"text":"This drive-thru Starbucks location is great! I have been here several times both in the drive-thru and at the counter and service is friendly and fast both ways. Although this is just a drive-thru location, there is a fairly large covered seating area outdoors as well as a family bathroom. Additionally, they carry a very small collection of some Starbucks merchandise (Christmas ornaments and other small things) in case you're ever in a huge crunch to get something. They also sell major newspapers."}
{"text":"I'm a Starbucks fanatic but this location is substandard. It isn't as clean and neat as other Starbucks. Note, it's not dirty... just not as clean as others. 

It's very small so it can be noisy. The sound of the blender cuts through your brain that you gives you a brain freeze minus the frozen drink. The patio outside has uneven chairs. 

The staff are of course friendly but the service can be slow because this is a busy Starbucks. There are tools by the window over looking Danfort Street. Do not attempt to meet someone here, seats are limited... you'll end up finding another place to go to."}
{"text":"Great crew! Told them what I like(caramel macchiato iced or hot) they recommended frappuccino style. I went for it and it was on point. Have a wonderful day. Peace."}
{"text":"Located in the casino at Green Valley Ranch it's got all your standard Starbucks elements including comfy seating. Service is on the slow side depending on the time of day."}
{"text":"I lived in Seattle for several years and mourn the loss of access to Starbucks here.  No longer could I make a walk around the block for a tall blonde roast, get my expresso, or get a refill on my coffee for the day.  In Pittsburgh, I suppose we are lucky to even have one every 3-5 miles versus every block as in downtown Seattle.

It is true and I admit it, I depend on coffee for caffeine during the week to keep me awake but not all coffees get the job done.  Folgers is NOT the best part of waking up, Keurig is convenient but that is about it, and I just cannot lug my expresso machine with me everywhere I go.  Ugh.

I digress.  The bakery items, sandwiches, desserts along with my normal coffee order now can be realized again with this new store at Liberty Center!  Thank you, Starbucks."}
{"text":"Great location! Love the outside eating area. Got my drink fast, friendly staff, and will come here again!"}
{"text":"Positives: 
1- the drive thru moves quickly even when you think \"no way am I waiting in that line!\"
2- the location is easy to access and leave such that even in horrible rush hour, you can get in and out of the lot

Negatives:
1- I come EVERY day and order the EXACT same thing. No one remembers me. EVER. 
2- I constantly have to restate my order to get it entered correctly and I would think this is my fault but I don't have this issue at other locations
3- don't bother trying to use the walk up to beat the drive thru line. Soooooooo sloooooow. 
4- twice recently they have given me the wrong drink and I haven't noticed and needed to go to a SECOND Starbucks to get a corrected order. 
5- finally, some of the staff annoys me!  I don't want to talk about the details of weekend plans on  630am on a Friday. A simple \"hi, how are you, here's your correct order\" will do..."}
{"text":"This Starbucks just opened up and I am so thrilled that it's a drive thru! Not to mention, the employees here are much friendlier than the ones down the road! 

I ordered a grande iced coffee and a cake pop - because, well seriously, have you TRIED the cake pops?! I will say though that I was very excited about the cookie dough one, which is fairly new, and upon trying it, it was actually not that great. It had sort of a butterscotch taste to it and I'm really not a fan of that! I'd stick with the birthday cake ones. Can't go wrong with those! 

The service is really great! The girl at the window was friendly and engaging, as she struck up a conversation with me while waiting for my items. I think this may be my new go-to Starbucks, folks!"}
{"text":"Nice addition to the neighborhood, now I don't have to get in a car to get my soy chai fix. They have recently stopped serving butter tarts, apparently others do not like them as much as I do (I need an army to stop me after 3rd), so that takes away from a perfect experience. The baristas are Ok, somehow there is always someone different with only a few regular people. In my opinion, there are not enough tables, sometimes it is tricky to get a seat as people chat for hours. Once had a guy there pour my soy milk in a whole milk cup, when asked if it was normal he said \"no\" without any further explanation, ever since then I tend to check if it is being poured into the right cup. Overall 3 stars it is, no more, no less."}
{"text":"Nicely hidden between Allen rd and Bathurst this Starbucks makes for a great coffee stop if you find yourself stuck in traffic on Eglinton. Baristas are friendly and my soy chai latte was done by the book, prefect temperature, perfect amount of soy and chai. Only draw back, there's only about 12 seats inside and most of them are at high communal tables in front of the house, which means it's not as useful as a meeting spot, but is more of a grab-your-coffee-and-keep-walking place."}
{"text":"A simply massive Starbucks...located inside the beautiful William Penn Hotel.  This place is always swamped and it is normal to see the line wrapped around with 20 peeps deep.  Don't let this deter you...be confident and go forward coffee seeker....these Baristas are amongst the very best and will have you out within 5 minutes....

Take your Joe and Danish...relax and enjoy the gorgeous lobby of the William Penn Hotel...."}
{"text":"Just moved to this area and this happens to be the Starbucks nearest to my house. Can't be happier. I work from my computer at coffee shops quite a bit and two deal breakers for me have always been adequate WiFi and a decent temperature. I'm sooooo happy to report this Starbucks has both! Not to mention it has a big open space with big open windows, tons of natural light and is always clean. Looking forward to getting some good work done here this year!"}
{"text":"Good Starbucks.. it's close to my work and it is easily accessible. The drinks are always good and the staff is friendly love the lemon pound cake great addition to any drink!!"}
{"text":"Nice barista but everyone behind the counter seemed lost and in a rush. It's quite a large store but not the cleanliest of Starbucks locations I've been to. They did not have what I ordered and conveniently replaced one of the items I ordered with something they had without asking me first. The Caramel Macchiato I ordered was also bitter with not much (if any) caramel in it and definitely not up to the Starbucks standard."}
{"text":"Very sub par Starbucks location. 

The service at this Starbucks was meh. I waited at the counter for about 5 minutes and nobody acknowledged me. I had to ask someone who was preparing a drink if someone was working the register. She nodded her head at another employee who then came to take my order. I really didn't understand why they ignored me in the first place. I sat at a table near the counter and heard the staff complain about customers and their job very loudly. Not so professional. 

The place is always packed. It is hard to find a free table. I can't really complain as I too came there to study but the majority of the tables are taken by students who take up twice the amount of room that they need, leaving very little space to others. Not ideal if you are going there for a coffee date. 

Overall, I would not return to this location."}
{"text":"I've been regularly attending this Starbucks for the past 2-3 Years. 

The store is always kept clean and the staff always great you when you come in. Nick does a really good job at getting to know his customers and tries to make every interaction personal. 

My only complaint is that the staff have recently changed and they are not anywhere close to accurate with orders! Especially in the drive thru. 

Otherwise if you're looking for somewhere to relax, enjoy a coffee and maybe catch up on some reading or homework! This is your place."}
{"text":"I am a ridiculously loyal Starbucks customer. Patricia the manager has just left me with the feeling of never wanting to spend a dime at any Starbucks again, let alone an afternoon studying.. Patricia took my specialty drink order so personal.. reciting over and over how want I wanted was a latte (not 4 shots of blonde espresso with pumps of white mocha with almond milk in a venti cup). I am a picky nursing student who works nights as a cna. I spent about 5 unnecessary minutes discussing why it wasn't just a latte (2 shots of espresso) she wanted to charge me $3 something to fill my cup. Nonetheless the customer is always right, I already paid $4.00 for my drink that I was unhappy with. Why would you as a manager be so hostile towards a customer on Valentine's Day of all days"}
{"text":"Starbucks are generally a good idea and this shop in the Great Lakes Service Plaza on the Westbound side of the Ohio Turnpike is a great spot for a coffee break. The service has been efficient each time I have visited and the quality of the dark roast pour-over has always been up to expectations. The prices are on par with expectations for Starbucks in this region of the country as my Tall coffee was $2.10 with tax included on my last visit. If you are traveling this section of the Ohio Turnpike, this place provides a nice respite."}
{"text":"A solid 3.5 star Starbucks that is located upstairs in the new Holt Renfrew hallway.  

Most mall Starbucks are lacklustre but they do serve decent coffee when you're dying for a caffeine hit.  This one in particular was actually quite amazing as it has a CLOVER!  For all those who truly like good coffee, the clover is a programmable brewing system that takes in account everything... time, temp, pressure, and it's programmed at HQ for each specific bean.  They only use their reserve beans for Clover.  If there is ever a time to drink coffee black at Starbucks... this would be it.  

The service wasn't very fast but I dont blame the staff... they had at least 6 people at all times going at it.  The people who are not used to ordering at Starbucks was dragging down the wait time in a PAINFUL way.  I almost feel like they need a primer ... I digress.  

They do have several tables off to the side to enjoy your coffee.  It was quite packed during a random Sunday and I would say it's probably hard to snag the tables for 4.  I wouldnt say this is a good place to work but a decent place to people watch.  Especially for those who struggle painfully to order a medium double double."}
{"text":"Dear Starbucks... 

I appreciate how you spent a day training on racial bias.  I applaud you for that attempt and effort.  While you're doing corporate training, can you also train your staff to be knowledgeable on how to make a decent drink, be organized, clean, and actually attentive?  No one likes waiting for 15 minutes for a drink that was placed through your app because your barista cluelessly forgot to check those stickers.  You claim it's the faster route but I counted about 10 people who came in after me to order at the cash got their drinks first.  

In addition to all this, I was somehow able to purchase an item that is no longer available that day.  The barista didnt offer to refund or do anything about it.  I had to go myself to the cashier after waiting 15 minutes and getting fed up to inform you that my drink hasnt been made and you're missing the croissant.  I would have expected at least the barista to say, you can get a refund and let me help you or this person can help you.  I didn't get any of that. 

To be fair, he was a bit of a hot mess... milk from all sources was spilled on all over his work station.  He splashed his pours, had espresso dripping everywhere, and every cup that left his area had milk all over it...  he was in no shape or form to be a tiny bit organized or helpful.  

The drink was as bad as his pours... bitter and yet somehow magically watery.  I didnt think that was possible but here we are.  Oh Starbucks, I would go to you as a consistent baseline... no more.

I did end up getting a refund but I requested it at the cash myself.  I just feel this was probably thee worst experience I've had in a long time at a corporate brand that considers itself a step up from a regular chain (like Tim Hortens or McDonalds).  Definitely not a step up or at the same level... Sorry Starbucks, its a clear 1 star for me which is super rare.

{"text":"I had a moment of utter confusion when I first came to Sherway Gardens and tried to find Starbucks.  I knew they had a store here since it's on their website and people walked around with their cups.  But when I looked at mall map... nothing.  I even walked around the ENTIRE mall in search of it.  I couldn't find it... I ended up going to Second Cup (which is just as good and Canadian).

Turns out the reason why I couldn't find it is because it's INconveniently OUTSIDE the mall but 'attached' to the physical building.  The only way to access it is to walk out the mall and voila, order to your hearts content.  Due to the fact it's outside, it has less traffic than Second Cup so it's easy to get an espresso drink without waiting.  

Service is quick and efficient.  The cappuccino wasn't bad but certainly not the best. Average fare for mall coffee. So if you're desperate for Starbucks, trek outside.  Otherwise, you have choices inside the mall with Second Cup, Michel Baguettes, Tim Hortens, and Faema that are more conveniently located inside."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this location. It is my fav! I love the day core and the spacious seating but they have. I always receive friendly and fast service. Their drive thru is very speedy as well."}
{"text":"I adore this Starbucks location. I still remember the first time coming here during a hot August day in 2013 with one of my friends, and I found their unsweetened iced coffee so refreshing. 

To begin with, I love the bounty of parking spot there are around this Starbucks. I can always find a spot to park, and it is fantastic. In addition, there is also a drive through at this location which I find very useful.

Secondly, this location is impeccably clean and organized. I love how when I walk into the cafe, the trash is never overflowing and the floor is always clean. 

Thirdly, I love the way the cafe is set up. There are numerous tables people can sit down at and do work or talk to their friends. There is also a wall just dedicated to windows to allow natural lighting. There is a section where they have all their products you can buy near the counter!

Finally, the staff is extremely nice! I always have a positive experience with them and i always leave with a smile on my face. Even when it's crazy busy, they always seem to be happy. It seems they enjoy working at Starbucks!!"}
{"text":"I was in the area and decided I needed some coffee desperately.
I had a venti cappuccino extra wet.
The baristas where friendly and nice and my drink came out very fast.
The drink was made perfectly as well.
I would recommend this Starbucks to all."}
{"text":"This location has gotten my order wrong countless of times and I'm just too stubborn to always make sure it's right before I leave. Whether it be the amount of scoops I ask for in a drink to the type of milk I ask for it just isn't correct. I understand mistakes happen & it does get busy but it's just frustrating when it happens countless of times from the same location."}
{"text":"Wrong order 3 times in a row. Management needs to change here, 
Waited 20 minutes for 2 Lattes and a soy latte."}
{"text":"Why can't this location be consistentl good? Because when they're bad they're BAD. Plain ignorant of their own menu items, jargon, and preparation. I spent 10 minutes trying to explain to the barista the creme frap that was on their menu. She brings out a plain frap and says that's a creme frap. Seriously? They also never warm up my banana bread when requested. Never. The say they do. She also gave me the wrong size straw for a venti size frap. This has got to be intentional. This location deserves the sh*t ratings they worked hard to earn."}
{"text":"Yes, it's Starbucks, but it's more. It's the ambiance! It's inside the William Penn, for heaven's sake, how can it get any better than that? Unlike some Starbucks that have few seats due to all of their merchandise, no matter what size your group -- within reason -- you'll have plenty of room.

Oh, and I have to say ... the baristas are great too. I know Starbucks will remake my drink if they get it wrong, but it sure is nice to get it perfect the first time. I've never had one I didn't like here."}
{"text":"It's now my favourite location. Awesome staff nice decor. 

Caroline got the extra mile to find products they didn't had at the location. Really appreciated the effort. Some would simply had said \"we don't have it\" she sent me an email the same day with other locations having the product in stock"}
{"text":"I've been to this location three times since it opened, and have not had a good customer service experience at all. Last night I had to ask for the scone I ordered after waiting five minutes, and then it was dry. The condiment bar was filthy, the trash cans were full, and instead of bussing the shop, the four employees on duty were chatting with each other. I give up."}
{"text":"This Starbucks is located on campus at UNLV inside the Student Union. It's ALWAYS busy with lines often extending outside the store and winding around the corner of the SU. Students and staff need their caffeine fix, right? Seating is hard to come by since many students set up shop here with their laptops and homework. Over the summer term, it's one of the few fast food joints open in the early AM. Clean location and super convenient, hence the busyness.

{"text":"This Starbucks is a new location inside the Aliante Casino, wedged between the buffet and Cabo. This shop is cozy, immaculate, and even has super nice employees staffing the joint. For those Starbucks fiends on the hunt for a late night score, rejoice! The perks of a casino location is that the store is open later than usual. Another welcome perk is that this specific location offers a 10% discount for military members! Doesn't get any cooler than that. Excuse me while I enjoy my cinnamon chai tea latte.

{"text":"I'm hoping this review doesn't let the cat out of the bag....

This is a much less crowded, lower priced option vs the Starbucks right in the Casino at Caesar's. If you're staying in the hotel, make the walk to get your coffee here.  In the mornings, it's filled with workers, very few hotel guests. It's always easy to get a seat.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  We came here most mornings on our recent stay.  Even came in the afternoon a couple of times.  Just a great place to get a beverage or a bite to eat...at a normal price point!"}
{"text":"i will speak for most of starbucks in the montreal region - service is amazing.
fast, efficient, everyone is smiling and willing to help. need to customize your order? sure! want a decaf caramel pumpkin spice tea with 3 shots of espresso 5 drops of the blood of a virgin on a full moon?? sure.
love it."}
{"text":"One of The better  Starbucks I have been to. Was reviewing some of the comments left here and was shocked to see so many negative ones. Looks like an x employees way to upset the ratings. 

I always get my order on time and it's made just as I ordered it."}
{"text":"Good place after night work to relax a little bit and drink a hot drink in the Winter. Feel warmed and satisfied."}
{"text":"Obviously they have never had another job in their pathetic life's. Honestly you go in here to get your favorite Starbucks drink and already mopping the floors not even a \"hey it's wet watch your step\". Continue to be attended by a blind bat who can't even read an order or even hear if for that matter. Really I needed to repeat my drink order twice. Then the black chick making the drink mentions not even a thank you or gives me a straw. Like honestly speaking a simple \"here you go enjoy\" won't kill you. Then the last idiot in there cleaning the windows doesn't say excuse me and proceeds to pass by me. Honestly these people need to get fired or move to a Starbucks in Montana where the population is the deer. Absolutely horrible service! One star is not worth of these three excuses for baristas!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with a cup of Starbucks hot Green Tea Latte on a cold Winter day!  Ahhh.. The taste of Green tea..I'm lovin' it! 

Location is alright considering it's close to the office building, well, quite a few. Parking is always full though. Like most Starbucks, they have some friendly staff and quick service. Too bad no drive thru!"}
{"text":"Nice sized starbucks. Always clean with nice staff. It is right down the street from a high school and a college so the afternoons can get pretty crazy all school year but this starbucks is usually big enough to handle the crowd. This Starbucks is the Starbucks I compare other Starbucks to."}
{"text":"Um... it's a Starbucks, so it's very similar to other Starbucks lol. There are two Starbucks near this intersection, so I don't find that they get too unbearably busy in the evenings or weekends (I don't think I've ever been here during the day on a weekday though). The staff is friendly and fairly quick. I used to like coming here for the big comfy couches, but the last time I was here they changed the design of the store a bit so now there's bar stools instead. The stools and tables offer more seats, but I liked the lounge feel for hanging out. Since this is close to Moxie's and Future Shop and other stores/restaurants, finding parking can be a little tricky sometimes."}
{"text":"Night shift girls are unprofessional. Side conversations are more important to them than assisting their costumers... So sad."}
{"text":"I've been to this Starbucks location a few times now and I love it. I'm not a coffee drinker so I appreciate their wild selection of teas. I normally stick to a green tea or a herbal variation. Their pastries are yummy and I often get the lemon pound cake. 

Ample seating here to get some work or homework done. What else can I say? Get over here :)

EDIT from 5 to 4 stars - I almost forgot to mention that the drive thru line is horrible. I never want to enter the drive thru because I would rather walk into Starbucks but the only way to enter is through the drive thru. I think the exit line can easily be made into an entrance and exit. Please fix this Starbucks."}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever had any issues with this Starbucks location messing up an order, but there's something inherently wrong with the amount of time it takes for them to serve anyone. I've ordered drive thru which can take upwards of 10+ minutes for any day. I've ordered pickup in the morning and they are either still working on completing the order, haven't completed the order or don't know how to organize mobile pick up. And of course don't dine inside if you think that will be quicker. Lack of management. Lack of friendly customer service; probably because they aren't fast and always behind."}
{"text":"So I'm waiting 15 minutes for my coffee and they never call it out, the way they do at every other Starbucks. Yeah it's busy so I guess it just takes a while. And I'm sitting right at the counter so what do they think I'm waiting for?  But then they say they made it (I think they forgot) and I should have asked for it."}
{"text":"I was never huge on Starbucks but this location is convenient for when I work around the area. Spacious and clean. I like that there's a large communal bar to sit at for when all the other seats are taken. Plenty of outlets and very clean washrooms. Haven't used the drive thru but that seems pretty handy considering there's limited parking. May be my new go to for coffee."}
{"text":"Wow. The baristas work like a well-oiled machine.  I got in the line that wrapped around the store and was still in and out in 5 min.  Unbelievably quick service!"}
{"text":"Well, you know, it's a Starbucks. At this point, I've come to expect reliably good overpriced caffeinated beverages from any Starbucks I wind up in. And I'll get the same here. But the long drive-thru lines make driving through or ordering in a painfully long experience. By the time I get my caffeine fix, it's time for bed. This is a large location with plenty of seating inside and out. It's clean and new. I waste way too much time waiting for my drinks, though."}
{"text":"I love this Starbucks. I'm so glad it got moved from the sprouts parking lot, now it's a drive-thru and I'm almost here everyday. Service has been on point so far and super quick. They make my drink great, I either get a iced cinnamon almond milk macchiato OR a cool lime refresher. Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. They are a Starbucks but not a Starbucks that accepts Starbucks digital payment. REALLY?!?"}
{"text":"Long Drive thru line. But its easy in and out of there. What else can i say about star bucks that you dont already know. :)"}
{"text":"L'ancien local délaissé par Presse Café coin St-Denis/Ontario est devenu le nouveau Starbucks du Quartier Latin. Vous avez une grande table centrale pour les groupes et/ou pour travailler. Ouverture depuis le 25 juin dernier. Comme d'habitude, wifi gratuit."}
{"text":"The barista making drinks (kayla) proceeded to talk to a regular customer for six minutes before even starting to make my drink. It is possible to talk WHILE making drinks. She was holding MY cup while talking and had her hands against the rim of my cup which is gross and unsanitary.  It was not busy at all and it's unprofessional to gossip while putting her gross hands all over the top of my cup. It took longer than it should've and it was more expensive than normal Starbucks."}
{"text":"This visit was disappointing. We were at the fashion center and we actually walked all the way to this location because my friend wanted to come to this particular Starbucks. I'm not complaining about the walk but definitely of the quality of the product served at this location. We ordered one cafe late and one cappuccino. To our surprise both tasted the same, we felt we were Drinking just hot milk. My friend didn't want to take it back because he doesn't like confrontation at all, but it's not about confronting it's about getting your money worth. Any how, I took mine back and let them know about it, I even gave them the benefit of the doubt that maybe the machine is not working, then the attendant takes it back, and gives me another one saying give it a try on this one because I did put a shot of coffee in it. Honestly it was the same thing, got frustrated and there was no point to say anything any more, because it should have been fixed the moment I told them about it. Any how so much for the excitement to walk all the way to this location, lol, I should have just gone to the one at the mall. If it was the same experience, at least I would have save my trouble to walk. If you come to this location at your own risk!"}
{"text":"Such a wonderful starbucks. They are so busy in the morning but they always seem to get people what they need.  

Sarah, the friendly greeter, is a doll! She is definitely a one in a million employee! Couldn't ask for a better way to start my morning. Having someone remember your name and order is great customer service. The store is so clean and organized, that's always appreciated! Thanks guys for making me happy every day."}
{"text":"A warm spot with great Starbucks service, strong espresso and a nice place to hang out for Internet. 

Monday through Friday they open at 5:30 am, 6:00 on Saturday and 7:00 on Sunday.  

Grande Flan latte is $2 until January 19th.  (2014)"}
{"text":"Small footprint location, mainly catering to the local condos and customers of the neighboring Canadian tire and IKEA.  Not much sitting room and even less power ports to charge up on.  A better location during warmer months as they have a very large patio attached."}
{"text":"Upon coming back to this location.  The new staff appears preoccupied with other matters and not caring much of the quality of service. There are many seniors here chatting away and keeping all seats occupied. I will goto another sb location going forward as this is not acceptable"}
{"text":"Great little escape steps away from the path.  Bring indoors, they really created an out doors patio feel with the openness of the seats and spaciousness.  The staff here are super friendly and all facilities are kept very clean and well stocked."}
{"text":"Not even the great Starbucks could overcome a 1 day delay in launching it's newest cafe on a site once dominated by the King (Burger King).  There is plenty of parking, drive through and convenient hours (5am to 11pm).  The setup is very open with a lot of seating catering to groups of all sizes.   The crew is very friendly and knowledgeable of their products even on day 1!

I will look forward to frequenting this location to sample all their goods"}
{"text":"In the fall weather many people start showing the long faces but not here!  The ever perky staff always bring a smile to all patrons.  They get to know you and your drink preferences very quick.  They always go above and beyond with everything.  They even whip up new drinks for you to try out for next time. There are plenty of power plugs to charge up and washrooms are kept very tidy."}
{"text":"This Starbucks is horrible! I couldn't reload my card and the Barista was a total asshole! Will never come back to this location."}
{"text":"Coffee always taste burned.......   Staff are really good and service is spot on every time!  They want you to leave happy and I like that in customer service!"}
{"text":"This is my neighborhood Starbucks.  The staff is friendly.  The food and beverages are consistent.  Only thing I'm not crazy about is, after the remodel, the comfy chairs have been replaced with high tops.  It seems like I can never get there in time to grab a seat at the banquette bench.  So, I am less likely to linger over a book and order more."}
{"text":"Best Starbucks service I have gotten in a long time. The baristas were super busy, but very professional and apologized for my 2 min wait (wow! I usually wait longer at other coffee shops without any apologies). The quad shot pull was exactly what I was expecting (super strong, not bitter, with enough volume to stretch it out for a bit). Not all Starbucks or other coffee shops are alike. This specific one definitely tops off my list of good places - probably because of a strong, motivated, hard working crew. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Usually i don't get enough caramel in my drinks when i say extra but they put more than enough and i love it."}
{"text":"Very efficient for a very busy Starbucks. But the floors seem pretty dirty, tables are nice and clean though.

Staff are attentive and friendly. No problems with correcting mistakes at all."}
{"text":"I wanted something hot and delicious on my way back home on my road trip. I ordered a skinny vanilla latte and my husband got a light mocha cookie crumble. The drinks were made quickly and tasted delicious. I was surprised because I forgot to ask for my latte to be made extra hot. However I didn't need to because it was already at a hotter temp."}
{"text":"Spacious and conveniently located Starbucks just at the edge of CWRU, with both a front and back entrance (front door faces Euclid, back door faces entrance to the Courtyard Hotel. It shares an open space with the Citizens Bank, so the back entrance wasn't as obvious since the sign on the door was for the bank (but there's a big Starbucks sign on the wall above). Staff was friendly, but the interior of this store was a bit messy/dirty. There was a puddle of some liquid on the floor right in front of the order counter, and trash on tables that wasn't cleared. Staff was polite and quick with making drinks. There wasn't a line when I came, but one formed about 5-10 minutes after I received my drink, so looks it can get quite busy.

Also, again, no free parking here, which is too bad. There is a lot for all the retail shops nearby, but it costs $1 for every 30 minutes of parking there (park and pay at the machine, then go back and put the ticket on your dashboard). This is a great location if you're walking on campus, and/or already have a parking spot in one of the university/hospital garages, but otherwise, just your typical Starbucks."}
{"text":"Came here for the Unicorn frap and there was a long line up - nothing unusual for Starbucks. After paying and waiting for 15 minutes, the barista tells me they're sold out. Literally just looks at me and tells me they're sold out and says nothing else. 

Ummm, okay... Can I get a refund? I don't quite understand why I'm solving the issue here. Usually they are supposed to ask if I want a free substitute or give me a free drink card. Call me entitled but I used to work at good ol' Sbux so I know the problem solving process. 

Also, the long lineups here are not without cause. I counted 7 employees behind the counter, but only one was on bar making drinks. How does this even make sense?

With so many stores around the cit, I probably won't come back to this location."}
{"text":"I really do think that this Starbucks must be the one that new employees get trained at. I've stopped here to get my usual drink on multiple occasions due to the fact I pass through this area frequently. My drink of choice is simple, an iced coffee with extra soy milk and classic sweetener. Every time, it has been wrong, either the classic sweetener is not added or they barely put in any soy milk, AND I'M ASKING FOR EXTRA. Let's be honest, I like my iced coffee light brown colored and sweet(like my women). I usually go through drive-thru to get my drink but today being National Coffee Day, I decided to walk inside and try my luck. Yet again, this Starbucks has failed me. I was served this bitter unsweetened icy concoction. I gave you multiple opportunities to right your wrongs, but it's just no use. This location is now forbidden."}
{"text":"Ridiculously slow. They need more baristas because I shouldn't have to wait 20 minutes for one (very simple) drink."}
{"text":"It's hard to rate Starbucks. They're a chain, and the idea is that they're interchangeable, so if a given Starbucks adequately imitates the \"Starbucks ideal,\" does that mean they get full points?

Anyway, this is my local Starbucks now, and it's nice enough. There's a fireplace in the front, with comfy chairs, and at least two places where you could plug in a computer to work (one in the front window, the other along the de Brébeuf side wall), so you'll often find me here for hours on end with my MacBook, headphones in, \"working\".  Like all Starbucks, there's free wifi, and there's a restroom with a changing table. The music is ok, and the baristas are nice, even if they often forget to give me my 10cent personal cup discount. I know, big whoop, right?

The only downside I can think of is that the temperature seems to be poorly regulated, so one minute you're breaking a sweat, and the next an air conditioner vent makes its presence known directly overhead by blowing icy wind down the back of your shirt. Bring a scarf and dress in layers, and you'll be fine. 

Extra points for the fact that in the mornings they often have bite-sized samples of their food items, and the other day after I'd been sitting there \"working\" for 4 hours, buying only a coffee and pastry and getting free refill after free refill with my Starbucks gold card, a barista comes and hands me a free pound of ground coffee, because they were rotating their stock behind the bar. Can't guarantee that'll happen to you ever, but hey, free coffee! 

I'd prefer to be supporting the local guys, really I would. But where else can I feel comfortable setting up office, buying just one small coffee and using the internet and their comfy seats for 4+ hours? Starbucks has that niche (the unpaid grad student without an office niche) well-covered."}
{"text":"I generally avoid this location at the mall and opt for the one in Chapters. I've never found this location to be very speedy and there's always a long line on weekends. 

Off-peak hours its generally ok though."}
{"text":"Came through here during TIFF. Despite the huge numbers of people they had tons of staff making beverages and getting everyone through the line quickly. My London fog was up to normal Starbucks quality and was done way quicker than I normally experience at my regular locale.

Nov. 30-day challenge 33/30"}
{"text":"great place....large...lots of room...nice staff..however, if it is really busy....don't be in a hurry!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love that this place has a drive thru. Very fast and friendly service. It is clean and spacious inside. There is also a patio for summer days."}
{"text":"I work nearby and i used to frequent this store regualy but his location is terrible.   The tables and conidment stands are always sticky, the service is slow and my drink is almost alway incorrect, with something as simple as putting 2 raw sugars in an Americano, they either forget to add it at all but have even put it in twice.  The only reason I come to this location is because the next closest store is at Fairview mall."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of this Starbucks. 
No couches 
Slow wifi 
Slow service 
And it's on a busy street, at a busy intersection, so you can imagine volume levels.
Try the Starbucks at Dunfield and eglinton or better yet one closer to Davisville."}
{"text":"Way below the Starbucks standard,

My wife and I are frequent Starbucks customers and gold members for over ten years.

We have no a doubt this Starbucks location has become the worst Starbucks to visit in Calgary, and perhaps in Alberta.

The problem started several month ago when one of the black girl who works in that location became store  manager and started to put tons of restrictions to the customer; such as requests for ice, coffee preparation details, etc.

We have had quite a few upsets overtime and I have seen how other customers have been treated, so I decided to stop coming to this location. 

This girl does not know how to deal with customers, the owner should consider keeping her at the back so she does not need to interact with the clients.

Thanks

PS:  I am surprised that there is no more negative reviews for this location."}
{"text":"The crew is the best! As soon as I walk in someone is already making my drink! Thank you guys for getting my day started right!"}
{"text":"I find this Starbucks quite spacious. 

The set up are more for singles or couples as there are not even a large table. Great for loner like me as sometimes you don't want to share and want some privacy.

Tons of outlets!!  They are integrated along the pillars along the huge windows.. so laptop users like me doesn't feel like we are the unwanted and should stay at the back near the washrooms!

Here everyone is on their laptops. I don't feel out of place even if I hang here for hours .................... I just feel so nerdy!"}
{"text":"Some place you know you would not like it right when you step in. This Starbucks is one of those.

Due to the limited in space and it being so busy...the whole store are just full of people waiting... one time to order and other for the drinks...

The place just smell funny and without circulation, I don't even want to sit inside. They do have a patio so that is a way better option on a nice day."}
{"text":"This Starbucks is quite conveniently located at the Dufferin and Steeles. I usually love Starbucks but maybe I just having one of those bad days..??

The staffs here are nice, cheerful and perky. Coffee are ok... 

I even found a table at the back with electric outlets but ....

This is just such a awful view looking out of those dirty/muddy windows with all these garbage bins lining up....7 of those!!

The speakers right on top of my head plumbing out music.... making me feel so tense and just could not concentrate on anything... damn forgot the ear plugs at home!

It is just one of those days....

Drinking the Dark Roast Black is not helping...."}
{"text":"Another Starbucks opens up in the area.

Spacious interior with high ceiling. Love the huge storefront windows facing Queen St. There are even hooks underneath the bar seating area for jackets and handbags.

Music though maybe a little loud.

Tons of electric outlets if you need to charge up your gadgets.

Not a bad place to hang out especially after 7 pm when most of the Indie Coffee Shops in the area is closed."}
{"text":"Lack of Seats!

Long lines for drinks!

I would not go to this Starbucks as there are other options in the area. This parking lot is just crazy, the driveways and the lanes between rolls of cars are so narrow, a lot of crazy drivers and a lot of senior drivers... all these make parking or driving in the parking lot extra dangerous!

I will pass!!"}
{"text":"I found this Starbucks' location not as busy as others I been to. Not too many laptop users sitting here for hours.

Service is fast and friendly. 

Drive Thur always a welcome sight when it is cold or rainy outside!

The furniture though a little dated, my table is so scratched up and sticky!"}
{"text":"There are how many Starbucks along Yonge Street??? I really lose count. Seems like there are one at every corner?!

This Starbucks is located a few Block North of Eglinton.

Smallish in size. The tables are really close together and I felt like I am bump into everything and everyone when I walk in!

I was hoping there are more tables downstairs but ended up the stair leads to 2 washrooms. 

The bar stools facing Yonge Street does give me a good view of the busy Yonge Street!"}
{"text":"I could not even find a seat at this Starbucks on this particular rainy overcast afternoon... 

The tables here are so small.. and people just having their laptops set up and a single person took up the whole table... didn't help they put their bags on the empty chairs across from them!! 

So 8 tables with singles... I am not trying to force someone to share a table or talk with me over a coffee.. I just want to sit down!! And people your freaking bags should not be taking up the seats! 

Aside from that.. standard Starbucks... with deliciously looking goodies.. which I almost tempted to buy one of those Chocolate Caramel Pretzel... I have to really resist the urge to so NO!! when the girl asked me anything else!"}
{"text":"My thirsty led me here, and the summer rain made me stay... I cannot think about a better place to get stuck than here at Starbucks...

Comfy armchairs, sofas, light music... Free WIFI for me to plan where to go for lunch.... and this place is quite quiet....

Zzzzzzzz

I wasn't drinking coffee, an Iced Green Tea unsweetened... 

They do have a nice patio by the side....."}
{"text":"Always the best customer service! They know how to make great drinks, and so friendly! I love this spot:)"}
{"text":"This location is very slow! I went in one morning and 4 people were working. It was crunch time: 7:30-9am and everyone was headed into work including me. The drive through and in-store were slammed and one of their staff members was dusting the front of the food shelves. Dusting! I have never seen this in a Starbuck's. I do not recommend going here unless time is not important."}
{"text":"Yes, there's a drive thru, but at prime time, skip it!

In the morning rush, you will definitely get your order more quickly if you go inside to order or do mobile order from your phone.  Mobile order is pretty dang amazing--order from your phone and it'll be ready when you pick up.  The only disadvantage I know of is that you can't bring your own cup, and again, you can't go through the drive through.

The remodel did indeed remove the comfier seating, which I believe is a Sbux wide effort to get customers in and out.  Still, the corporate overlords have done a good job with this location, as they are fast and friendly...it's just that the tiny parking lot is not terribly compatible with a drive through."}
{"text":"Always come here to grab sth to drink before shopping. Lol

I call it Good luck starbucks store!!! Coz after having beverages here we can always find sth.we love"}
{"text":"Located in the York concourse, this is probably my favourite Starbucks around the area during the morning rush hour. I've tried about 3 other Starbucks locations in the area but they always left me disappointed and delayed my arrival time to work. The great thing about this Starbucks is that when I order on my phone, they know that there's going to be tons of orders so they designate a person to hand out the online orders. 

Even if I don't order online and order in person, they have a designated person to take peoples orders, enter it into the system beforehand and then once you go to the cashier you wouldn't have to repeat your order. Even though it's really busy, they don't even have to ask for your name. By the time I'm done paying, my drink is already prepared.

They also have about 10 people working during the morning rush and they're all very friendly which is the usual Starbucks. Other locations in the area should take note on how this one operates because it's a lot faster and I feel their system makes the employees not as stressed as others.  This Starbucks will definitely be a usual location for me every morning when I get off the train."}
{"text":"I am giving this Starbucks 2 stars because their coffee in general is decent, however, tonite in the drive thru we watched as one of the workers wiped all the counter tops and handles to the equipment with a dirty wash cloth and was on the ground wiping something and then proceeded to get milk out and pour it and pump syrup all while touching our cups without washing her hands.  Then, when we tasted our drinks they were awful !! They were totally watered down and my white choc mocha had nothing but foam and only was filled half way !! I should have taken a pic... When I went in to have the drinks re-made, both of the employees were rude about having to re-make the drinks for me. Finally, I asked the girl that didn't wash her hands to please wash her hands next time she makes people their drinks and instead of her apologizing and admitting what she did was wrong she tried to turn it around and make it seem like what she did was okay with a bunch of excuses.. Watch these employees !! You will get sick by their lack of hygiene around food if you're not careful !!"}
{"text":"I have hadn't such a bad experience dealing with a Starbucks manager and supervisor in a long time. It's unsettling to see such bad customer service. Don't treat your customer with disrespect and derision. Will not be coming back to this place."}
{"text":"Rude staff. Pretty sure woman who took care of me was the manager but she is very rude. Not helpful at all. I could not even claim my free drink through my Starbucks app because they \"dont do\" free drinks. We also had asked her for help with the gift cards and her automatic response was \"I CAN'T HELP YOU\" Not good customer service!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this Starbucks at least 3/4x a week for the last 5 years almost. The staff here are great, some of the newer staff seem a little less friendly but they're still nice. Drinks are always made well and it can be busy at times but the mobile order option helps."}
{"text":"I like the new decor and set up, except it will get too crowded with their center display by the register.

I purchased my typical hot caramel macchiatto with non fat milk.  

They did add more tables but removed the comfy chairs."}
{"text":"On September 11 we came for coffee I don't know how it happened but our debit card was left behind the following day we call and our debit card was there. So now I'm waking up today to find out that someone took money from our account please everyone  be careful with your ATM card when you guys buy something here."}
{"text":"Someone woke up one the wrong side of the bed. This chick needs an attitude check. First off she just throws your drink at you. She didn't even call my drinks out and they were just sitting there. She was very unapologetic and just plain rude! You work in a place of customer service, which means you will interact with PEOPLE! As a manager of a coffee shop, if she was my employee she would have been gone. No patron deserves that kind of experience, especially on vacation. Watch out for this one!"}
{"text":"This is Starbucks, what do you expect other than the trademark crappy coffee with that burnt taste, free Wi-Fi, some desserts, cookies, wraps. I guess I could get some work done here."}
{"text":"Busy location. Wonderful interior. Manager was friendly and funny."}
{"text":"This is a regular Starbucks stop for me because it's close to my job.   It's as busy as any other Starbucks during the day, whether you use the drive thru or come inside.  For the people that complain or say \"it's so busy ... well yeah, there are people feening for their coffee just like you!  I wouldn't say the service is over the top or anything, but they do what they need to to get your coffee.  I appreciate the consistency.  Only thing I would comment is their selection for prepackaged lunches are a little slim compared to others so if you're coming on your lunch break to grab a quick prepackaged lunch they seem to always have the pb&j and hummus stocked."}
{"text":"The best part of waking up ... is having STARBUCKS in your cup !!!

I'm sure ALL Starbucks are busy during the day, this location is no exception.  The staff is friendly, both inside and through the drive-thru.   

Today, I decided to use their app to order my coffee and sandwich before I got there and it was amazing.  You can order online, pay online, and when you get there it's ready to go at the pick up window.    

Pros : fast and convenient if you're on the go.   

Con:  I ordered a breakfast sandwich and call me picky, but it took me a couple mins to get there and my sandwich wasn't as warm as I would like it.  Understandable since it is sitting there.  Also, if you have any offers from the Starbucks app, you won't be able to use it to pay online ... bummer. 

Other than that ... thank you Starbucks !!"}
{"text":"The customer service here is always top notch. All the staff is really friendly, and each of them always has a smile on their face. I hope that never changes. There was one barista I dealt with, that was really knowledgeable about the products and coffee they had in the store, and gave me tips on improving my expresso beverage. You don't get that kind of service at every Starbucks. I believe this barista's name was Clarissa. I called a few days later, and told her manager what a great job she did. I love talking to knowledgeable, and friendly people! Now if everyone in the world put as much effort into their job, as she does, the world would be a magical place (lol). I guess in a perfect world, right."}
{"text":"This is one of the slowest Starbucks I have ever been to.  The only reason I go to this one is because it's close to work. Be prepared to be wait a significant amount of time if you buy something here.  Better yet- use the online app!"}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service. Unfortunately the midnight mint mochas we ordered were almost entirely whipped cream. As in, they had very little frappuccino and tons of whipped cream. That was disappointing."}
{"text":"On my commute, I took a slight detour and picked the route that would pass by this Starbucks. It is a little difficult to locate when traveling west on University Ave as others have mentioned. It's definitely easier to access this place going east to downtown Madison, to enter and exit through the drive through lane. 

Since I was entering from the east side going west, I had to get creative and turn left and then right into the back of the Starbucks. From there, the drive through line was fairly long, so I looped around the small parking lot, pulled into a Handicap space and then backed out into the back of the drive through line. 

From there, I ordered a Venti Strawberry Açaí Refresher and a Blueberry Oatmeal. I forgot to ask for light ice for the refresher but I'm still slowly drinking it so it was made fairly well. Similarly, the oatmeal also had a good amount of water. Keep in mind that this place offers fresh blueberries (although I personally do enjoy the dried blueberries a little more.) 

Overall my food and drink was made well and I enjoyed it! Although the parking and driving situation could be made more ideal, it's still in a good location and the drive through is more convenient than not. Definitely worth checking out if you're around the area."}
{"text":"I've been to this Starbucks before but this was my first time using the mobile app to order ahead and pick up a Pike Place roast coffee traveler to bring to work. I was nervous that it was not going to be ready in time or that their would be an error with the mobile app that would make me late to work, but as soon as I arrived an employee was packing up my coffee traveler and had just placed it on the counter - perfect timing! It came with 12 cups, sugar, cream, stirrers, and napkins. When I arrived to work the coffee was still very hot, and was smooth and tasted great without adding cream or sugar. The coffee was still very warm 1.5 hours after being poured- which was nice as people arrive to work at varying times. Overall, the coffee tasted great and everyone enjoyed it, I would definitely recommend a Starbucks coffee traveler for any occasion and I will definitely use their mobile app to order ahead again. The only negative of the app is that you cannot pay for items individually at the time of purchase, you need to add money to your app's starbucks account in 10$ increments, so if you are only ordering one or two times you will still have to pay 10$ to add money to your account and you will have leftover money sitting in your account for future use. Otherwise, great experience with the mobile app and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this location has such poor reviews! Usually I wouldn't write about Starbucks but given my strong disagreement with the past reviews I felt it was necessary. 

This location is close to my house and my visits here are usually study sessions. Free WiFi and free refills make school work less daunting. 

The staff is always EXTREMELY friendly and accommodating. I'm always asked how my day is going, if I like my beverage, etc. The member perk of refills is a very confusing thing however the staff at this location always clearly explains what you can and can't get as a part of this perk (They usually let me refill a tea lemonade which most locations won't!)."}
{"text":"I get that they were busy but that is zero excuse to give someone an uncooked breakfast sandwich..."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times now. They always get my drink right. However, consistently short staffed and the condiment bar is usually out of something. 

I'm just grateful to have a Starbucks on this terribly boring stretch of Ohio turnpike, but there's a Panera as well at this rest stop if you find the Starbucks line is too long."}
{"text":"They always make our Latte on point... Very friendly and helpful. Never had a big problem with the way the service is or anything. Just love this place."}
{"text":"Drive Through - YIPEEEEEEEE! - 5 Stars.

The fact that everyone else does this, and by consequence there is a VERY STRONG possibility that you get STUCK in the drive through when it could have taken you less time to park, get out of your car, and order your triple shot cappuccino - BOOOOOOOOO - 1 star.

The fact that you CAN enter both through University Avenue AND behind the Mobil Gas Station (thus avoiding the hoopla of trying to turn left on University - HOOORAAAAAAAHHH = 5 stars!

The fact that there's never a cohesive line since there's two drive through entrances, and well.. it could get ugly if people are craving their javas and are trying to manoover their huge ass SUVs and you have a tiny little car that SHOULD be easier but these people are EVIL and vicious and may not let you in accordingly - BOOOOOOOO 1 star.

The fact that on REPEATED occasions, the !@#$% baristas did NOT know that a triple shot cap was the same as a cap with an extra shot, and wanted to charge me for a latte with two extra shots, and it is PATHETIC when I, the CUSTOMER, has to tell them \"Um.. no... A basic cappuccino has TWO shot of espresso.  That's why if I add another one it's called a triple shot.  Look it up!\"  (Oh hushie, I say it in a nice way, which probably accounts for my weak coffee.. ) - BOOOOOO 1 star.

The fact that many times the coffee has been free because of this (they try to overcharge, and after a discussion, I'm right! -  YAY - 4 stars..

The fact that they don't know how to make a cappuccino and this makes me wary of the amounts of times that I asked for a cap, and got a latte with foam, then left, and said \"DAMN, this coffee is weak\", 2 stars.

I think that averages to three.  Good math skills have I got, you know!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Starbucks. I am here almost daily. The employees are always polite and quick. Love it."}
{"text":"It is Starbucks so you know the drill.  Sometimes is is super busy and other times it is decent.  The baristas vary from excellent to braindead.  The place is usually clean.   Not the worst place to get a cup of joe."}
{"text":"I bought a bag of coffee beans, and I asked them to grind it to fine but they grind it to coarse grind, what a wasted of money and time! I will never be there again!"}
{"text":"This Starbucks has really come up in the last year. They built a bigger building, and improved service and speed quite a bit. My favorite place."}
{"text":"This Starbucks always has the longest wait at the drive thru, It shouldn't take 20 -25 to wait for a drink or even to place an order. Even the inside wait is horrible!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love coming to this Starbucks!  The service is great and my Cappucino is perfect every time!  Only one problem, parking is very limited.  There are days that I don't get out of my car because I can't find a parking spot.  Avoid rush hour!!!"}
{"text":"Not coming here again. Orders are not correct. Disappointed cause I would like to grab to go coffee on the way to work. I'm a Starbucks fan and my drinks doesn't taste the same. I know the difference between skim milk n 2% ..my drink isn't hot enough. So bad. I ordered a skinny venti caramel macchiato extra hot n they me a grande semi hot super sweet caramel rich milk drink. I went thru drive thru so. Waiting in line and didn't want to re order.... I'm not coming here next time"}
{"text":"I really like this particular Starbucks!

Staff is very friendly and very efficient. 

Very busy store especially after 3:00 in the afternoon."}
{"text":"Quick efficient service , not many lineups  compared to other locations in the mall.   Love the frappuccinos  in the summer ,and the lattes in winter.   Saw some exotic coffees and the barista  recommended the Vietnamese coffee as it's quite strong . That's the coffee I shall try next"}
{"text":"Worst Starbucks EVER!!! 25 minutes stuck in drive thru. I was almost late to pick up my child from school. There were only 5 cars in line!!! This is the second time they have made me wait so long! Why is it you go to other Starbucks and there can be 10 cars in line and you never wait more than 5 minutes!! This place sucks. Over priced, to long a wait and not so friendly people! Ya shove it"}
{"text":"As a New-Yorker I love Starbucks. In this location, they have on the display very nice big cakes. Only on the display tho. The one you'll get will 1/3 of the size!! /-:"}
{"text":"Not the customer service I was expecting from Starbucks. The line was way too long. Drive-through was also long. Workers were very very slow. Waited about 35 minutes for my drink. Need to push for new management. 

So the drink which was handed to me was covered in caramel. I was in my vehicle and had to drive to a local 7-11 to wash my hands. Starbucks is dropping the ball."}
{"text":"I love the convenience of this location!  Also-they serve the warm sandwiches-a plus in a grocery store location.  Plenty of clean tables in an open seating area!  Cawfee and groceries! One stop shopping!"}
{"text":"(This review is for the Starbucks located within the Desert Ridge Mall Food Court, and without the drive-thru.  'Thought to mention this detail up front, as it's easy to confuse this location with the Starbucks drive-thru located across the street.)  

I've come to this location countless times and it is, well...Starbucks, in every way.  It comes with all the usual pluses that we embrace Starbucks for, as well as most of those other usual pesky Starbucks headaches from the customer's perspective...(less the drive-thru wrapped around the building, of course.  Consistency, you gotta' give that to Starbucks.   ;)

I've found this Starbucks to be as good as most and better than some.  Though it can get a little loud and tight at times in the lobby, the inside seating is adequate for a quick break...but, it just can't compare with the larger, outside Desert Ridge Mall community Food Court patio.  Wander outside with your drink...catch the patio during a cooler and more quiet interlude and it can be caffeinated bliss amongst the warmth of sunshine, towering palms, song of the birds and bubbling fountains...(which are sure to bring big smiles and wet shoes to the many playful tikes faithfully drawn to these.)  

The night time ambiance here is just as inviting with its over-sized stone fireplace, located out on the patio.  I always seem to lose track of time while I'm out amongst friends here lost in conversation.  (I'll take that as a good sign. ;)  Get close enough, pull up a comfy chair and enjoy the warmth and glow while cradling your pleasure-in-a-cup.  ...And oh, here, bonus points for people watching. :)"}
{"text":"This is the brand new store about 1/4 mile away from the old location.  Frankly, the move was a bad one for customers as the store is actually smaller with very little seating and the parking is still a nightmare. Only plus is that they have a drive through that is convenient if all you want to do is get a drink and go. If you want to sit and enjoy your drink, this probably isn't the place to go due to extremely limited parking and seating that is almost always full. Bad move. Baristas are ok, not as friendly as other locations."}
{"text":"Closed all the time during normal hours. Can never get a drink here anymore."}
{"text":"I'm not a Starbucks fanatic and don't even drink coffee so I come here for the tea every now and then. When I moved to Vegas by far this is the busiest Starbucks I've ever seen. I'm not a drive thru person and I like that customer service experience rather than driving Thur one window to pay and then proceeding to the next. For those that are, depending on the time, the lines are ridiculously long. I prefer going inside however they are just as busy as their drive thru. Theirs usually around more than 7 baristas working altogether lol that is a lot. Clearly they are a busy location. Most of the time something as simple as screwing up my simple order of making my tea is ludicrous. This happened 7 times to me and the most recent time I told the barista that my tea was plain black and not what I ordered she gazed at me because they had to make it again. If you do it the first time right correctly you wouldn't have to do it again. I didn't even get a \"I'm sorry\" and they definitely don't say thank you or anything. Friendly wise they usually just yell your name out when they past out drinks and that's all you get. I've postponed reviewing this location, but I feel like I gave them one too many chances to redeem themselves."}
{"text":"Tried the mobile order but arrived to hear that they were not in stock of what i ordered. Would have been nice to know before...."}
{"text":"This isn't the largest Sbux in terms of seating, but the seating is in a separated room from the baristas so the noise and distractions are toned down a bit. There is mostly half booth and half chair seating along one wall of the cafe. There is good plug availability. There are also 1-2 tables good for groups. There are often also used for multiple single guests. 

The staff at this location is pretty friendly especially in the drive through. Customer service is pretty good too. When something I ordered was out of stock I was given a gift card double the price of what I ordered for the inconvenience. 

The drive thru line can be really long; the line can back up into the street. Even in those cases though it moves pretty fast. To get the fastest service use mobile ordering or go through the drive thru - probably in that order. Im my experience walking inside when there is a long drive thru line doesn't save time.

While better than the location this Sbux replaced, parking is still an issue especially since the lot is shared by other businesses."}
{"text":"EXTRA watery frappaccino's! Annnd I waited forever in the drive thru (which wasn't busy, nor was the inside of the store). How do you mess up a blended drink?? Throw some ice in it..the end."}
{"text":"Slow service, rude staff, and I sat in a drive thru (at the window - no one in front of me) for 20 minutes while the staff argued amongst themselves about where the salted caramel topping was placed and by whom. When I asked about my drink, the staff member said \"You have to pay first\" and when I politely told her I paid 20 minutes ago, she closed the window, rolled her eyes, and yelled at another staff member to \"deal with this idiot.\" I. Will. Never. Go. Back."}
{"text":"There's not much to say as a Starbucks is a Starbucks, but the service is great and prompt which is all I can expect from a place such as this.

The store itself is tiny so if you're looking for a place to chat this is probably not the location for you."}
{"text":"Went to this Starbucks this morning (3/1/12) and frankly, it's subpar compared to other Starbucks. 

When there are 8 or so employees, you'd think that the place would run like an efficient, well-oiled machine. Nope. Everybody is cackling, acting foolish, trying to be funny and generally just running around and not getting anything done. There shouldn't be a line backed up with that many employees. 

I had an unsweetened green tea and my dad ordered a Java Chip Frappuccino. He complained to me that they didn't sweeten it, outside of the chocolate chips. He had a jar of stevia in the car to fix it, but still, the drink wasn't properly made and looked like it was topped with whipped topping rather than whipped cream. It just tasted funky. 

The word that comes to mind when I think about how the employees acted is \"rough.\" I highly doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"Conveniently located right off  of the lobby/check in area of the Augustus and Octavius towers.  Staff service great, very pleasant, and knowledgeable of the product - they knew that some Starbucks had started to replace Tazo tea with Tevana.  they accept Starbucks cards but they dont have a reader so it takes a little longer as they have to manually enter the card number.  that said, my transaction was handled pretty quickly and the person at the register did not grumble while entering the card number - very pleasant experience.  Nice bench to sit on, but no tables/ chairs as its a smaller corner spot.  Standard food items available."}
{"text":"Although this is my first review of this Starbucks, I've been coming here for the past little while. I find it much less busy and friendlier than the \"other\" location I used to go to.

Service and staff have always been excellent, the cashier/barista has always been helpful in assisting me when I am pondering a choice and I find the overall environment pleasant, lots of hello's and good bye's to make you feel welcome and appreciated, I've made this my go to Starbucks since my first visit here. My coffees and specialty drinks have always been made to my liking AND...they actually spell my name correctly!! Yes, even I was surprised how many ways it has been misspelled!

Seating inside this place is limited, however, there is a outdoor patio with seating in the summer months (I suppose winter too if you are so inclined). A drive through is also available and takes some getting used to its unconventional central lot entrance location, but once you've driven through, its no longer an issue. 

The front door is located on the south side of the building, making the westerly located parking lot mismatched and awkward to navigate when looking for the entrance spot, but again, once you've been there, no longer an issue."}
{"text":"This place is great in the morning, employees very friendly and fast. That is why I am giving this location 3 stars instead on 1.
In the afternoon you will wait approximate 10-15 for a coffee and most likely your order will be incorrect. I clearly said I didn't want caramel in my coffee and for some reason they put extra, on top, bottom and on the side. When I told them I specifically said no caramel I was told that is how it's made. We definitely need another Starbucks in this area."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever...so rude they all seem lathargic or brain dead 

No smiles ..over priced they charge for whip omg ...if you use your app they get upset..then barista'makes drinks and they just sit there ..horrible expierence"}
{"text":"Well, well well.  The new kid to the neighborhood is finally open!

As you may or may not know, this location used to be an El Pollo Loco, and there was a Starbucks directly acrossed the street in the Albertson's center (and in the grocery store as well).  But the chicken place flopped and Starbucks got the grand idea to relocate and open a location with a DRIVE THRU!!

Now, as I said in my review of the previous location, I am not a huge fan of Starbucks (or coffee, really).  The old location was cramped and parking was not nice (nor was the staff most times, but I digress).  Since I am not a big coffee drinker, I like to stop in for caramel apple spices in the winter, or an iced tea or lemonade in the summer.  It's not that often of an occasion.

Until NOW!  How can I possibly avoid the allure of a brand spankin' new drive thru, just a block from my house?!!  

The staff seems much friendlier - I don't know if they hired new people, or if the employees are just as psyched about their new digs as the customers!

I haven't been in the new store yet, just through the drive thru.  But I assume it's pretty typical or any other Starbucks.  Who knows - maybe after going inside I might actually revise this to a 4-star review!! (Don't hold your breath, lol)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite SB! 
Drinks - made perfect every time! I love the black ice tea no sweetener. 

Service - love this drive-thru. So new and high tech screen. I can hear them so clearly! Friendly service with a smile! Inside service is just as great. 

Location - super conveniently located in the Trader Joe's plaza. Very clean and new!"}
{"text":"Good fast service from the staff, despite a lot of folks ordering frappa-crappa latte's.

The are moving across the street to a new building which should offer more space for lounging and working and less outdoor space in the sun.

The staff seems to be a mix a Veterans Bari Stas  and new hires, so you're experience may vary from mine as a regular.

I see a lot of scrubs and bubble sheets here, so shout out to the nurses and teachers."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  Not asking for another cashier to come up when the most annoying and ridiculous customer was asking questions and letting us all know about her life was up.  Won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"Just walked in with my dad while on vacation for the week because we wanted to take advantage of the bogo holiday drink promotion. Got there at about 1:45, so we waited til 2 for the promotion to kick in. Service was great from the moment we walked in to the moment we actually finally ordered something. Candace was particularly cute, I mean, nice, with her very friendly attitude and demeanor. Even when they got slightly busy, I saw that she kept her great attitude, which is a great thing to witness. I hope Candace continues to be as awesome as my first impression of her implies. The drinks were also perfect. Thanks Obama."}
{"text":"This SB has two floors: the first floor has about 4-6 seats in front looking out the window and a few two person tables in the high traffic area where the counter is. There is also a small patio with 4 tables out in front. The upstairs has additional seating- no handicap access as far as I could see though. 
The service here is hit and miss although relatively fast generally, sometime it can be super slow. There's always a line up here as well. 
The worst time to come is after school when all the kids get out and go to SB to buy their cookies and grande lattes (kids these days! Where they get the disposable income to buy SB...who knows!). It seriously become a mad house with 20 kids in line."}
{"text":"Always quick and efficient! Stop by here on my way from and to school! Super busy but they get drinks out promptly."}
{"text":"I had great service at this Starbucks and the interior is really nice and cozy. I see myself studying here! There are tables and chairs along with the comfy chairs to lounge."}
{"text":"This is for the Starbucks in the Smith's grocery store on Horizon Ridge and Eastern. I go to order and the woman behind the counter, who is leaning and chatting with a Smith's employee promptly states that her espresso machine is broken and no hot drinks, so unless I want something cold she can't make it. So I say \"a Venti Carmel Frappucino with whip, no caramel drizzle, with mocha drizzle\". She actually looks disappointed that she has to make me a drink. She slowly makes the drink while she is still gossiping to the man. She is griping because she has to take pain meds and when she is off and comes back to work no one has done anything and she says \"so I'm just done\". Griping the entire time. Finally finishes my drink. Caramel drizzle all over the cup and on top. I say to her \"wow, that's a lot of caramel drizzle\" and she says she put chocolate on too. I said that's not how I wanted it. She ignored me. As I walk out the frappucino looked incredibly runny, not what I'm used to at a Starbucks. What's up with that customer service? Someone needs to talk to the hired help there and give her a lesson on not bitching about the company you're working for in front of customers and just do your job.......so annoying...."}
{"text":"Brand new Starbucks right by where I live. More of a study/work friendly Starbucks as the seats are mostly barstools with ample outlets. Staff are always very friendly and it even has a drive thru!"}
{"text":"My favorite Starbucks location downtown. This is not an official Starbucks, so they may not have everything at a regular location. I'm always impressed by the fast service even during the morning rush. All the employees are super friendly and great at what they do. I'm that annoying customer with the overly complicated and obnoxious order but they haven't messed it up once. We're still working on getting my name spelled correctly though...."}
{"text":"My office at University Hospitals is about 300 feet away, so getting my coffee fix here is quite convenient. My favorite person there is Jacqueline, just the cheeriest barista ever, and she is smiling and welcoming even when this place is packed with customers. That, in itself, makes the routine of buying coffee a more pleasant experience.

In all, there's not a whole lot to say about this Starbucks. There isn't any outstanding characteristic that makes this better than another, but it is usually clean and service is decent. I've had my orders messed up in the past and occasionally I find the baristas can be a bit curt (never Jacqueline), but it can be a very busy place with CWRU and our hospital right across the street."}
{"text":"The Starbucks is really small doesn't have much a way of sandwiches or anything. But the service is great forgot to ask for a Trente and got a Vente instead. When I realized I forgot the Brista made up with the difference. I always go to frys shopping because they have a Starbucks"}
{"text":"This Starbucks is located inside the Safeway market.  

We were staying at the Westgate Entertainment / Gila River Arena area and this came up as being 2 miles from our hotel.  We came here on a Sunday morning around 10:00 am and one side of the parking lot was having a classic car and motorcycle show.  That took up 1/4 of the parking lot right there.

Once you walk inside the left side of the store, you will literally run right into the Starbucks, and most likely a line.  The store (if you can call it that) is tiny, and there's 2 baristas working it. One was cashiering, and the other making the drinks.   The cashier wasn't able to stop to really help (except to serve a brewed coffee or pastry) because the line was never ending.

When I was in line, there were 3 people ahead of me.  Apparently the queue for the drinks was probably 8 people deep because it took a while for my iced tea lemonade order to come up.  

The barista was nice and friendly but the service slow.  Three stars for being an A-OK location..."}
{"text":"This is just what you would expect from any other location.
It's a chain with a solid reputation. While some stores are better than others, the baristas here are efficient, friendly and fun."}
{"text":"My second favorite location! They fix bad drinks from other locations and are very patient and knowledgeable about offerings. I make it a point to go to this location when I'm in the mood for coffee. Tip your barista :)"}
{"text":"Rude ass entitled workers  You guys should really work on your customer service, acting like you're working at McDonald's or something lol SMILE"}
{"text":"What an awesome Starbucks! I went here while I was getting my oil changed at Brakes Plus across the way and sat inside while I did some work. The staff here is amazing...not only are they friendly but they're efficient as hell. This location was SUPER busy and they were pumping drinks out like a well oiled machine. Zoey at the front was super nice and knowledgeable about their menu. Some Starbucks around the valley kinda suck but this one is great! My drink was done in like 2 minutes despite the mobile orders pouring in and a very busy drive thru. Great work guys!"}
{"text":"I have to preface this by saying I love Starbucks! Love their drinks, food, merchandise, etc. we were so happy when this Starbucks opened, as its right by our church/school. The building is very pretty inside and out, and everything is working and available unlike the Starbucks on Eastern, south of this location. This alone gets three stars.

But let me now write about what gets ZERO stars. The customer service. For the first month or so, it was GREAT! Then, it was ok. Not great, but not bad either. Fast forward to last week. I got two vanilla frapachinos for my kids, one with caramel. I get this every time and have never had an issue. I pull up to the window, and I'm waiting, and waiting, and then the barista starts to make my drinks. I'm the only car in the drive-thru, so it's not busy.

As he's making them, I'm watching, and see that he makes them both without caramel. I stated caramel, and I was charged for caramel, but no biggie, it's a mistake! He eventually opens the window and starts to take my card. I say \"I'm sorry, I tried to get your attention to tell you, but one of those should have caramel.\" He looks at me, slams my card on the counter, then rolls his eyes at me and sighs! REALLY??? He then slams the window shut, and angrily fixes the issue. Opens the window back up, gives me my drinks, my card, and no straws. He then realizes he didn't give me straws, hands then to me, and closes the window.  No \"thank you\", no \"sorry for the mix up\", nothing. Terrible customer service.

I tried to get his name, but we was wearing a blank name tag. So barista with the grating goatee, thanks for the less than stellar service! If I happen to be \"helped\" by you again, I'll make sure to get your name."}
{"text":"Customer service stinks. I asked a girl for half and half twice. Each time she grunted at me and didn't say or do anything. Others around her completely ignored me.  I had to find someone else to ask and it turns out it was right next to the girl that was grunting at me. Please hire more professional workers."}
{"text":"I don't drink coffee much anymore and even if I do, I prefer Dunkin Donuts or Coffee Bean. But my friend just had to have Starbucks. So we waited in the long line for 20 minutes. That's 15 minutes too long if you ask me. The Starbucks fascination is everything but ephemeral."}
{"text":"My favorite Starbucks in Vegas, the barista's are the best..always friendly and funny! This Starbucks gets me through many work days the the nickname they write on my cup is the best."}
{"text":"Starbucks tranquille, idéal pour s'installer si on est chanceux et qu'il n'est pas plein! Quelques prises de courant pour les laptops et le bar a quelques bancs qui sont cool si vous voulez jaser avec les baristas! C'est l'un des Starbucks les plus calmes donc les employés ne sont pas dans le rush et ont un moment pour jaser. 

C'est un Starbucks Reserve, avec une machine Clover, alors amateurs de cafés, essayez un nouveau café sur la Clover! Il y en a souvent des nouveaux à tous les 2-3 mois et il est possible de les prendre en version glacée!"}
{"text":"This place is busy but it's one of the better Starbucks I have been to. The barista was helpful when they messed up my coffee, he did not hesitate to make me a new one. Great vibe and super nice atmosphere. Though it can get busy."}
{"text":"Usually I have no problems at this location but a sassy little Hispanic young lady with too much makeup on had nothing but attitude."}
{"text":"Typical Starbucks, even without a line it took a long time to get your coffee but then again I think there was a line around the building in the drive through."}
{"text":"About 60% of the time, the staff, are polite and get my order correct.  However, the other 40% they question my order, and mostly get it WRONG!  Just there today and requested for less water than the drink usually has, and again as I get my drink, it's completely full.  When asked the man at the window, he claimed he didn't want to give me a cup that wasn't full.  So, I have a watered down coffee drink that doesn't have cream it yet. Thanks Weekend Drive Thru Staff!!"}
{"text":"I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who doesn't like this Srabucks, but then again, I don't like many coffee shops. I went here after the time when the Badges destroyed Rutgers, on Halloween day. There was no empty chairs. the place is so small that it wold be smaller than a studio apartment., many better coffee shops in Madtown."}
{"text":"If you are going to this location, use the drive-through. The workers inside absolutely give them priority. I had been afraid of the drive-through line because it had probably six or seven cars in it, so I decided to go inside. My mistake. For 20 minutes I watched them rush through all of the drinks for the drive-through customers, as those of us inside waited and waited. Literally 20 minutes for two drinks, and workers were stressed and not smiling. Avoid."}
{"text":"This Starbucks is quite busy, which is to be expected because of its location, but the staff is always friendly, and the snacks are yummy. Great place to stop in for a cup of coffee or tea. They've got lots of different seasonal treats too!"}
{"text":"The most dysfunctional Starbucks in the world. Trust me I had Starbucks in China and Taiwan. Synergy is not part of their team meetings.. Made 3 customers drinks wrong before me. Then I get my strawberry Acai tasted like water. I always go to the one in the Smiths  on Eastern and Horizon.Ridge Pkwy So sorry I didn't today. What a waste of drink."}
{"text":"Never had an issue with my drinks or staff at this location. Too small to have a drive thru. The seating is pretty large considering the whole size of the store itself. But it is somewhat difficult to get seating because people use giant tables for one person. If you're planning on coming with more than two people, I suggest someone camp out to get a good spot. 

And no one's ever spelt my name wrong (I didn't even know \"Vanessa\" was difficult to spell to begin with) - PLUS!"}
{"text":"Love this location!! Super friendly staff and close to my house. I always come here occasionally to study because it's nice and quiet."}
{"text":"I do enjoy coming to this starbucks location. It's a bit small but it's quaint and they have a cute patio facing the main Street. 

I noticed they have some new baristas working. And although they don't seem super friendly they seem to be doing a fine job at baristing. :)

Looks like starbucks is featuring a lot of new items lately.. Baked goods and coffee plus new merchandise. They are featuring their 45 year anniversary with some cool items. Also they have a new combo I'd be interested in checking out. For $9 you get a sandwich or salad, chips or popcorn, a banana and a water bottle not bad at all. 

I also like this location for the merchandise. Because I don't find them super busy they tend to have the items sold out or difficult to find at other locations. 

One downside is the music is a bit loud if you plan on working here or reading but I learned to just tune it out."}
{"text":"This location is quite efficient in serving customers at the counter and making their drinks. It can get very busy but they seem to be very organized and communicate well. 

And I got a yummy chai tea latte extra hot of course! It has been a long one coming. Tastes so divine!! Mmmm

Come to this location you will be super happy. And even better it's part of a Chapters location so you can buy a good read!!

Yay for coffee and books. Two of my most fav things ever."}
{"text":"Love this Starbucks! The ladies are so nice and sweet and are a great start to my day!"}
{"text":"I come here almost everyday and why not?! I mean the atmosphere of this store is better than any starbucks I've ever been to, and not once have they made a mistake with my order. 

Shout out to the coolest and prettiest barista, Charm! Always cheerful and polite!"}
{"text":"I had a coupon from my gold star rewards in my email. For some reason, my gold card on my app was not connected to my email. Hence, the transactional system could not give me the freebie.

The supervisor was super friendly and reactive to the situation - making sure that the situation was handled, by advising the cashier on what to do. Ultimately, I was a happy customer leaving which is what matters - even if that location is not my starbucks, this is another reason for me to continue returning."}
{"text":"I miss the Illy that used to be in the mall. They had better coffee and food and great custumer service. I'm not a big fan of Starbucks coffee and the Custumer service isn't all that great. They also used to give a mall discount. I think when you don't give a mall discount your not a team player. At the end you will make more money. I no longer work in the mall but I feel bad they don't"}
{"text":"It's been almost 3 months since they opened, and this location consistently shows that they still don't know how to make Starbucks drinks and that they're totally ok half-assing it. I'm only slightly ashamed to say that I almost always tend to go for the more instagrammable fraps and lattes. If I'm paying $7 for a coffee, I only ask that it's made how it's supposed to be.

We ordered the zombie frap over Halloween, and got a pale green frap with almost white whip vs the magenta it's supposed to be. When I handed it back to them, I couldn't believe the worker told his manager - see she noticed it was the wrong color. Why would you serve something you knew was totally wrong, then act completely put out when I ask you to remake it the right way. 

I heard they kept on a lot of the employees when Cafe Press closed, and maybe that's the biggest problem. Whatever the reason is, don't waste your money here. If you're at Venetian/Palazzo, try one of the other coffee spots - Bouchon Bakery, Illy, Coffee Bean (although they've raised prices to match Starbucks)."}
{"text":"Came to this location this morning, my first time and ordered a Grande lite ice SOY green tea latte and I had a sip it tasted like regular milk and had to toss it  disappointed. The place was so dark."}
{"text":"They were fast and friendly!! The cafe latte with coconut milk and equal I ordered from the app was ready within 3 minutes and it was delicious! I wish the Starbucks where I am from should get their act together and be more like this one!"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly employees! Great location and big courtyard to sit and relax in plus free wifi from Starbucks and from Cox, you choose!"}
{"text":"Nice, roomy Starbucks off the lobby of the Omni William Penn Hotel. I have been there several times over the past 5 or 6 years and have always found the baristas and cashiers to be friendly and efficient.  The store is architecturally interesting, as well - high original ceilings and large plate glass windows offering views of the surrounding streetscape."}
{"text":"Wow!! I stop in Starbucks pretty often and today this store was impressive! I was helped by \"L\" who was friendly and FAST! 

She made my drink almost immediately with zero lolligagging. It also was made perfectly just the way I asked with an awesome mixture ratio (I get a lot of flavor and creme). 

I will make sure to stop for my favorite drink here whenever I'm in the area. Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"Whether you want coffee, specialty coffee, Frappuccino, tea or a baked snack, they have a little of everything."}
{"text":"PROS:
+ service - Props to the baristas, who were super cheery and friendly on a busy Sunday morning! There were only two of them behind the counter, but they were pretty quick to serve customers and just really pleasant overall. 
+ outlets
+ cool mural and decor

CONS:
- seating - They have this high couch thing and small tables against the wall and counters along the window (great for people-watching). It wasn't very comfy and I felt like I was slowly sliding off the couch and had to readjust my position every so often, but it's fine if you're at this location by yourself for a quick pick-me-up. But seating is definitely awkward if you're with a friend because you'll have to sit and chat side-by-side (unless there are more tables/chairs in the back that I didn't see). 

I wouldn't come here for long work sessions, but I'll definitely be back if I'm in the area and need a mid-shopping snack if the baristas are always this upbeat!"}
{"text":"I go here every day. I give it 5 stars because I love Starbucks. But I must say some times the baristas don't get my drink right but that's okay because they usually fix it."}
{"text":"Starbucks coffee is historically my go to place when I need a bit of energy. This particular location is fast, friendly and makes it enjoyable to either enjoy in or take your beverage away. 

Only draw back is the parking. It's absolutely a destination for a walk or you will loose the battle to the parking ticket agents."}
{"text":"I have had very mixed service here. When I first started going here to get my coffee fix, the service was terrible and I got sick every time I went. A few months down the line, they improved greatly and I think it was due to the change in staff. I have an extremely bad dairy allergy and make sure they know that but, often times I've had them use whole milk in my drinks. Lots of drinks have been returned in order to get one that wouldn't make me sick. I love starbucks but, hate the service some people give. Two days in a row I visited and the workers looked absolutely terrible. They had an attitude of not wanting to work here and were really pushy. (This was fairly recently) If something doesn't change in the staff or their accuracy I will probably boycott this location again."}
{"text":"Review update: so previously I gave it a one star for just one bad experience. I still came back after that because of convenience. Every experience has been great and the baristas have been sooo nice and friendly and always have a smile on their faces. They are more than willing to fix your order if needed. The drinks are always on point and haven't disappointed yet."}
{"text":"I love going to Starbucks to get coffee. It's a great start every day. I get up at 6:30 am to get to Starbucks by 7:15am."}
{"text":"I was drawn to this Starbucks location because it looks beautiful and has plenty of comfortable seating. My husband and I stopped for americanos and breakfast wraps. The americanos were quick and good, but the wraps were disappointing. They took a while to make and looked very unappetizing. They were not wrapped well and were falling apart.  When I bit into the wrap, some parts of the breakfast wrap were very hot and some parts were ice cold.  If you are just looking for coffee, your probably safe; however, I would not recommend stopping here for food."}
{"text":"This review is for 10.30.2014.
I stopped by before work around 10:30am for Green Tea Lemonade.
I understand it was not a slow day, and I don't mind the lack of smiles and greetings, even the wait.
But I got the Green Tea Latte instead of Green Tea Lemonade. After I reflected the mistake, the agent looked at me coldly without saying a word. Right before she redid me the right one, she made another wrong drink, and no one ordered it.
I doubt if Starbucks still holds its golden branding after the two bad experiences back to back in different locations.
The only things stay the same are No warming services and No accuracy or efficiency of the orders."}
{"text":"It's one of the larger Starbucks I've visited, and i must say it's a nice one.  It's clean, and there are lots of seatings.  The service is fast, and the staff are friendly and helpful.  The only thing that would be nice to have is that there are more electrical outlets at each table for electronic devices."}
{"text":"Yes i love thiss place. Been too tons of starbucks but i can say thiss is my fav. Customer service was greeeaat. He was so nice too me and my girlfriend...."}
{"text":"Wow... this place is busy.... on a Sunday late morning. I can't believe how many people used the drive thru today, I hate to see it on weekday mornings. 
The store offers a lot of Starbucks merchandise  (different coffees and the cutest cups). The store looked clean and all the baristas where busy.  
I got service with a smile and my order was ready fast and it was yummy. 
Parking is easy right in the front."}
{"text":"I am a regular Starbucks customer. We just moved and this is now the closest location to us. Ugh!! They have never gotten our order correct one time. We have been here at least eight times now, so that's a fair chance to get it right. This last time, this is how much coffee was in my cup after the whipped cream melted!  I don't want to drive extra, but I guess that hassle is better than dealing with any more garbage from this location."}
{"text":"This one goes out to the heat wave. Screw you. No one, not even a Canadian in February, wished for this. My face is melting, my hair could rival any of the ladies from Designing Women* and I want to drown myself in a bathtub of freezies. 

Enter this Starbucks location. I know, it's the 'bucks. But this one is big, has vaulted ceilings, private meeting rooms and a patio. But who cares about the patio?! This place has Eh See. We're talking fridge temperature. We're talking I didn't ever want them to close. We're talking I had goosebumps I was so cold... and I was loving every minute of it. 

I also had an iced latte and am pleased to announce the return of the Treat Receipt, wherein, if you buy a morning drink you get an iced drink for $2 in the afternoon. Even if you just sit there all day. Amen.

{"text":"Starbucks is Starbucks. This location only has 1 guy working. Not the best situation for a Friday night on a holiday weekend.  line backed up really fast."}
{"text":"Horrible service !! It took five minutes to wait on each customer I waited 20 minutes with only three people ahead of me. the idiot clerk got my order wrong and screwed up the order for  the lady in front of me. No concept of customer service.  don't go here unless you have plenty of time to kill and lots of patience"}
{"text":"Staff was super friendly and knowledgeable. Lots of parking and they had lots of food still in stock including a pasta salad I have never seen before and chocolate donuts which had too much cinnamon or something like that (most starbucks are barren of food and snacks by early midday)."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with the service here and that they accept Rampart dining coupons!
Casino outlets can be scary, with their long lines and frazzled employees. That wasn't the case when I was here. It's a smaller store, but inviting nonetheless. I used my $2 dining coupon for a breakfast sandwich, and the employee was friendly and pleasant. It's nice to have a Starbucks at the Rampart Casino/JW Marriott hotel. I'll return to use dining coupons from the casino if i happen to get more in the future."}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff here are so nice and friendly. Even though sometime with a high volume of drive through customers, they can be super busy, and my order will be prepared a little bit slower, their attitude will at least make me feel much better while waiting! The location is good! Love Sunday morning reading here:)"}
{"text":"Hi Starbucks I would love to write and put five stars but when I was ordered coffee for myself and yesterday I from the rainy day the Asian lady asked my friend and I wanted to order we wanted something but she didn't wanted listening to i wanted but she did ask us our name we usually get good service at desert ridge but not really good service yesterday"}
{"text":"I ordered through the mobile app on the way there and wasn't sure where to pick up my drink so I stood with everyone else waiting for their drinks. One of the staff asked what I was waiting for and it turns out it was ready on the side (where the mobile app orders are picked up)."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Starbucks, I will drive out of my way to get a drink and a croissant from here. The staff is AMAZING, Alexa, Yahaira , Esmi, Jessica, Yasub, Brenda, Jacky, Teddi & Sarah, they all make this place feel like home and deserve some  recognition.  This store is kept clean, After coming to this Starbucks for 6+ years, I find it amazing how I constantly see the same faces, I even remember all the partners names ! Their turn over rate must be so low! - A very happy customer."}
{"text":"So the service and quality of this Starbucks has been getting better. More hellos and goodbyes are given.. more smiles and friendly faces... so whatever it is that has been going around, let's hope it stays that way!

They don't have the peach green tea lemonade anymore. It's now an infusion of some sort. Not as sweet. I would get the infusion and add strawberries. 

A few favorites of mine:
White Chocolate Mocha Frap
Cinnamon Dolce Latte
Java Chip Frap
Hot Chocolate
Green tea
Morning Bun
Cheese danish
Butter Croissant
Cake pops -- vanilla

As you can tell I'm a sweet person... lol"}
{"text":"I like this place.  I go to quite a few Starbucks places - even at the airports!

Nicely located.  Plenty of parking.  Drive through.  Lots of seats.  Superfast internet.  NOW - the single serve fresh brewed coffee.  What?  Saeco on steroids!?!?!?!?! COOOOOOL!

Got my coffee order was metered, ground, and served to me within seconds - or around that!

I like it!  I hope more places get this upgrade - fresh coffee and not getting the bottom dregs!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"I always have terrible service here. Unfortunately this is the only Starbucks in this area. The cashiers in the morning always have an attitude. I would not come to this location if there was another close by."}
{"text":"for a transit hub that never stops or sleeps, I was very disappointed to find out that this location closes at 9pm...every week day. 
how this station moves during midnight, I have no idea, but this location isn't helping."}
{"text":"I think that I would put this location above a \"standard Starbucks\" the service is super friendly, and the location is pretty clean. my only knock against this location, is that because it is one of the only starbucks locations in Vaughan\Woodbridge, the treats and goodies runs out very quickly. otherwise, a lot of parking, and good hours makes this location a gem, even better when chapters is open, cause then you can caffeine up and read some books."}
{"text":"a starbucks with a drive thru? 
are you kidding me? 
a one off location, pretty much crammed into a spot that barely seems even possible. the location Is great, with lots of parking and lots of seating inside, great service and super awesome staff. the driveway in and out of this place is a little bit tiny, so keep you're game on entering or exiting the plaza. 
this location sets the standard for what a great starbucks location should be, AND also should be a standard when it comes to drive thru's with starbucks. very very happy"}
{"text":"a really great location to get a cup of coffee or a light meal, for how busy this location is, the turn around for getting in and out is absolutely stellar. the location is really great as well. not a great deal amount of space to sit down, as with the high volume of people, this place tends to fill up really quick, even worse in the winter months. my only complaint is the hours. twice in the last month I've tried to get a coffee at what I believed to be a reasonable hour(before midnight), only to find out that the location is closed(at 9pm). not impressed with that aspect, but again, when they are open its a great location. super clean, friendly staff, and quick service makes this one of the better coffee shops in the area. 
this keeps me coming back"}
{"text":"Very good ambience with nice view of Lake Ontario. The internal decoration is very good. Liked the place as we got parking :) If not lucky with parking consider the library across the road. Would visit again when in the area."}
{"text":"This Starbucks is probably my favorite location, the drive thru moves super fast and the baristas running the drive-thru have always been so friendly, like shockingly friendly. I don't come here often because it's expensive and well.. it's big chain Starbucks, but when I really need some caffeine or didn't get a chance to grab something for breakfast this location has always been very convenient, in and out, and the drinks/food are made really well."}
{"text":"I like that Square One finally has a Starbucks where you can sit down and enjoy your drink. This is located right by Hudson's Bay/Top Shop when you get into the mall. When my friend and I lined up there were about 4 people in front of us and the cashier zipped through the line in 5 minutes, I swear. The baristas had our spicy chorizo breakfast sandwiches and our frappuccinos within 5 minutes which was awesome because I was starving. I recommend this place for a nice break while shopping for sure."}
{"text":"In general I am ok with Starbucks. You don't get the best coffee for the best price but you know what you can expect and the price is still ok. Not this Starbucks: Quality is lower than usual and when I mentioned this to the staff they asked me for my receipt which I didn't have because I paid with my Starbucks Gold Card. Without a receipt, they refused to help me. When I wanted to speak to the store manager they said that he is in a meeting and I have to come back 15 minutes later. When I came back 20 minutes later, the manager had vanished already and could be found nowhere. I was sent to a different Starbucks store to speak to a manager there which I didn't do because I had to catch a flight. When I arrived home, I talked to the official (and professional) Starbucks hotline who agreed that this behavior is unacceptable.

Starbucks in general: Yes, but not this location."}
{"text":"Very slow service, everyone is just taking their time while customers piling up. I've seen Starbucks that are equally or ever more busy with the same amount of employees but faster order service"}
{"text":"My first ever horrible experience at a Starbucks ever, I have never ever received bad service at a Starbucks before, not only was I over charged (they charged me for extra soy as syrup) the 2 girls working on Sunday December 10 need to be trained in customer service.  Stay away from this location..."}
{"text":"The staff are super friendly at this location and do a good job making my drink exactly as I like it."}
{"text":"Always a good cup of espresso iced coffee."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Starbucks location, unfortunately it closes early, but the people here are always nice. Keep up the good work guys."}
{"text":"Great Starbucks.  Everyone is friendly, the design is open and friendly.  Overall, one of my favorite Starbucks..."}
{"text":"I was sooo excited when they opened this Starbucks, Now I have one on route in my daily commute. It's located directly across from St.George Station (Bedford exit) in the bottom of the One Bedford Condos.

It doesn't resemble the typical starbucks layout, its looks like a long narrow hallway, its taken on an industrial concept with concrete floors and walls, high ceilings, a long banquet in the back across from the cash, more seating in the front with couches and a large table for group studying, plus a fireplace!

Fall time at Starbucks is my favourite time of year. 

My Fall Favouirtes here include:

Pumpkin Spice Latte - Espresso, pumpkin-flavored syrup and steamed milk sprinkled with a dash of pumpkin pie spices
It's a must have fall beverage!

Pumpkin Loaf - A moist, spicy quick bread made with ripe pumpkin and a blend of fall spices. 
I love that it has rasins and walnuts in the loaf and its coated with pumpkin seeds on the outside for extra crunch. It's a thick dense loaf but super yummy, great for breakfast!

Pumpkin Cream Cheese Muffin - Pumpkin muffin with crunchy, candied pumpkin seeds and cream cheese filling.
This is the ultimate muffin, its contains all your foods groups veg=pumpkin, dairy=luscious sweet and tangy cream cream cheese, protein=crunchy candied pumpkin seeds, carb=moist pumpkin spice infused batter. My favourite muffin!

Pumpkin Scone - A pumpkin spiced scone dipped in white icing, accented with pumpkin icing. 
This scone is melt in your mouth delicious! It's a large scone, it reminds me almost of gingerbread but softer and flufflier, the scone itself is not too sweet but with the glaze it balances it out perfectly!

Overall great service, there always busy here but they out pump of beverages prompt without flaws, everyone here is cheery and friendly with a good vibe."}
{"text":"Friendly, efficient, and they haven't messed up my order yet.  I'll just suggest some of you actually get out of your cars, put down your phones, and have a genuine interaction with someone for a change."}
{"text":"I go to this Starbucks when I am at work on my breaks to eat. The workers are super nice even under pressure. Great group of workers!"}
{"text":"I came here this morning and used the drive thru as I was on my way to work and wanted to make a quick starbucks run. There was only one car in front of me at the drive thru and still it took over 10 min for me to get my order of a tall caramel frappucino. Not just that but the frap I received had hardly any trace of the caramel drizzle that I enjoy. Slowest starbucks I've been to yet."}
