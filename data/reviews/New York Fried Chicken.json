{"text":"So on Tuesday I was walking by NFC, and I saw the 2 Piece Chicken and Wedges and decided to try it out. I noticed it was a knock off of KFC and the Srilankan girl charged me $8.00 and clearly the price on the menu was under $5. I gave a $20 and got back only $12.00. Stupid bitched ripped me off and I only got 1 ketchup and 1 hot sauce. 

When I got home I noticed that the chicken was over grown with steroids. The drumstick was the size of my Forearm. The food is greasy and the wedges was okay. I will never eat from there again. The gravy looks like a blob of lard, even my niece is scared to dip into it.

Don't feed yourself garbage, your better off going to KFC which is across the street"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this is a chain or a one-off mom 'n' pop. It looks chain like but then I can find nothing about it on the web. NFC (not to be confused with KFC) is a no-nonsense little fried chicken fastfood restaurant at the YorkGate mall near Jane/Finch. Aside from fried chicken, the place serves up fish and chips and an all day breakfast that looks like a pretty good deal (about $6.00).

I took a chance thinking this might be a Korean fried chicken place that has realized calling anything Korean just confuses the hell out of North Americans. Korean fried chicken joints are starting to be trendy in NYC (or at least with NYC area food writers). Hence, you can see how my brain connected some dots. (She wore red shoes, she knows the Red Wings are my favorite NHL team, she's sending me a message she loves me. Been there fellas? I have. Lots.)

Well, no. It's just a KFC knock off. Colonel Sanders (who apparently had himself cryogenically frozen http://basicinstructions.net/basic-instructions/2009/8/23/how-to-create-an-urban-legend.html) has been replaced by Lady Liberty (which the hip people call the Statue of Liberty). 

The chicken itself is okay. The batter, well, nothing beats KFC. I think the appeal here is the $2.99 special, two pieces of chicken plus fries or potato wedges. The wedges are actually pretty good and extra filling. Bring your own bottled water and  you've got a nice take out lunch.

Anyway, nothing here will win any awards but it's cheap and filling and the all day breakfast looks worth a try."}
