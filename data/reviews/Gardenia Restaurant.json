{"text":"Been going here for years for breakfast, lunch and dinner, great food and prices. Service is good, food is good, prices are good. The only complaint I would have to say anything about is sometimes the portions are not all that much......"}
{"text":"Good southern style food. We had two good dishes:  ribs and beef tips....with sides of greens and Cole slaw.....all good.  Prices were unbeatable"}
{"text":"This place is the definition of great food at a great price. I work 2 mi away so I always pickup and my orders are always correct. I needed a break from fast food so my coworker recommended Gardenia. I've been 3 times and my favorite so far is the stuffed chicken."}
{"text":"Fast fast fast diner food.   Delicious Chicken Pot Pie!  Seriously, we went for lunch and i SWEAR the waitress took our order, walked back to the kitchen and returned with our food.   Southern Home cooking Fast."}
{"text":"I am not sure how someone thinks this food is great.  It is subpar and out of the freezer.  There is no way that this is Southern fare that is good or even tasteful.  Nothing is homemade and food is dry.  Service is nice and the lobby is good.  But please close and stop serving food that comes out of the freezer.  Grocery stores are always open."}
{"text":"A good old Greek family restaurant. Blue plate specials of a 'meat and two' \"They cook it up good for you!\""}
{"text":"I enjoyed this home-town diner. The food was good country cooking, and authentic. Service was excellent. For a casual, comfortable meal at a great price, this can't be beat. The place was clean, and the booths and chairs, while not plush, were not torn or dirty.

I would happily go eat here again, and there are many local regulars on site.  

It is also close to the airport, and service is fast for a sit-down restaurant. They have daily specials."}
{"text":"I love the many options of comfort food they have. There daily specials are awesome always something different to choose from. The staff is always so nice and food comes out hott and in a timely manner. I would recommend anyone whos looking for some good comfort food to try gardenias."}
{"text":"Gardenia's is one of those restaurants I passed by a lot when I was younger and didn't think much about. Going inside is usually a treat! The wait staff are as sweet as can be! The food is pretty decent as well. Often I order food for pick up ahead of time, and its a very different feel. The restaurant and the people definitely gives the food that extra unf. If you have time to sit in I recommend it!"}
{"text":"Food was terrible. I took one bite of my food and couldn't stomach anymore. Staff was friendly but the food was disgusting. My friend couldn't finish her food either."}
{"text":"We grabbed a quick lunch before heading out of town. I had the pork chops and they were delicious. My wife and son both had the lasagna lunch specials and both enjoyed them. They have daily lunch specials Monday-Saturday. I would give them a try next time you are around."}
{"text":"If you want old school breakfast, this is your place.  nothing fancy just good, cheap food.

This is not a Sunday boozy brunch spot.  This is Saturday morning like Mama made it spot.

I got two eggs over easy with bacon grits and toast.  And that's what I got.  Plain and simple.

Wait staff was nice.

The bill was small!!!!

Great spot for breakfast on the West side"}
{"text":"I ate here once and I did enjoy the food it tasted fresh it was well seasoned and I was pleased I just wish this place got a makeover that's the only thing that I could say is that this place needs a makeover when you step in it instantly looks like it's a restaurant that's 30 years old and it kind of smells like it too lol. But it was a nice crowd in there so I assume the food was good and I went forward and I was pleased."}
{"text":"Gardenia has to be one of the best values in Charlotte: good home-cooking and a lot of it, for a great price. Their grilled pork chops are juicy and well seasoned, meatloaf like mom's, perfect fried fish and 2 people can eat well for under $20, tip included. Not too shabby!"}
{"text":"This food is not healthy.   If you don't want a long life then you may want to eat here."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  It's really good to have a restaurant that cooks with heart and soul.  I eat their several times each week.  The food tastes great and is priced GREAT.  No complaints."}
{"text":"I work in a pretty desolate area, and there isn't much to choose from in the food category. I'd say that I've pretty much kept Bojangles in business over here because for about 3 months that's where I'd gone just about daily. Which there's nothing wrong that... I love me some Bojangles..

Well a coworker told me and a friend about Gardenia, and I'm glad he did. It's close to work, but down a different road I'd never thought of taking. We got there and at first were dismayed by the parking lot until we pulled into the actual place. It stretches all the way around to the back. Ok, initial thoughts were replaced by the smelly good aroma floating out the door and straight up my nostrils to smack my brain. 

This created a chain reaction and my stomach automatically started rubbing blisters on my backbone due to hunger. You can sit anywhere you like, and we chose a booth against the wall. The menus are already on the table and the service is very fast. Great for a lunch time run in. I ordered a chicken pita and mashed potatoes. Both were just delicious. No fake taters here, yum! 

The prices were good, portions were good, etc. We headed over to the register to pay and my bill came up to $6.66, and being the superstitious person I am made an ACK!! noise. She laughed at me, and changed it to $6.65, so I could go on about my day. haha I thanked her and she said it happens all the time. :)

I'm sure I'll be back within the week. It's usually the end of the week choice for a treat!"}
{"text":"I came in on a Saturday morning along with my parents for breakfast. Upon entering, we were greeted and told we could sit anywhere we liked. We eyed a booth in the back corner and waited for it to be cleaned, which it was in a timely manner. Our waitress came over to introduce herself and take our drink orders. She was also helpful when we had questions about special instructions for our meal (ie, Momma wanted crunchy edges on her liver mush, lol!) Our food came out quickly but it wasn't our waitress that brought it out to us, it was another lady. Not quite sure what her role is in the restaurant, but this is when I took my star away from the rating. She had the plates and asked who had a particular dish. When my dad responded that it was his ordered, she continued to hold it up and gave him a funny look saying \"well ya gonna grab it?!\" Well dern ma'am! You want us to go back to the kitchen and cook it too?! My mom insisted after she gave us our food that the lady was having a difficult time extending her elbow or something like that...that's unfortunate and we definitely don't mind getting our plates from her, but sheesh! There's a way to talk to people and that wasn't it! Fortunately she wasn't our waitress so it wasn't a big deal. The food is good, decently priced, our waitress was friendly and the restaurant was fairly clean. I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast because it was close and figured we should give some neighborhood spots a try. There's nothing fancy about this place at all, but for a Saturday morning it was packed. Our service was alright, nothing spectacular and there were times we wished she came by, but the food was decent and well-cooked - granted it was eggs and hash browns. It definitely looked like this place had a bunch of regulars, as it's been in Charlotte for a while."}
{"text":"Popped in for a little takeout after an exhaustive day of thrifting nearby. I've always seen this place and have been very tempted to try it on multiple occasions but didn't get around  to it until this evening. 

I scored myself a 3 veggie plate ( I chose fried squash, green beans and yams) with a roll, and a side of ranch for dippin' fried squash for a fiver and change. The fried squash were thin, hot and crispy. Probably the best I've had in Charlotte ( since Louis's is technically in Harrisburg) and the green beans were tasty too. I'm not well versed in yams but I like mine a touch more al dente than how they serve them up here but that's just a minor critique since they still tasted good.

The staff was super friendly. The lady that took my to go order made sure I got my food fast and even used my name when she handed me my order ( always a nice touch). The owner ( I assume) was around and was also wonderfully chatty and helpful. 

I will be back to try more.

They have a usual menu and daily plate specials. The sides available also vary depending on the day. Note: Mac n cheese is on Wednesday"}
{"text":"It's a good ole southern home cooking joint on the west side. The biggest plus is the prices. Not many places still have dinner meal for less than $7 with 2 sides and a tea (their dinner specials come with tea). 

Food is typical.  Grilled pork chop is a little dry and tough. Better off with the fried pork chop. And when I said pork chop I meant super thin cut ones.  Country fried steak's gravy was the whitest I have ever seen... Thus a little bland.  It reminds me of comfort food people referring to when they talk about their grannies. Nothing against grannies (or moms), but I have found out in the 2 decades I have lived in the south that their cookings are normally pretty plain and non-eventful. But knowing so still doesn't stop us from wanting granny's pot roast because it is the consistency and thoughts and memories that matter.  What is off in quality at Gardenia is made up by the \"sweetie/honey\" southern hospitality and down home appeal. 

It's a solid spot for a low budget meal.  You will be happy if you have the right mindset and expectation."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from them yesterday. The prices have gone up about two dollars since the menu was posted online. We got chicken tips over rice with fried okra and mashed potatoes and chicken parmesan with a side of garlic bread. I should have asked for the specials, they had crab cakes. Our total came out to $18. It was a lot of food judging from the weight of the containers. But we found all the food to be very bland and no taste whatsoever. The mashed potatoes and gravy had the most flavor here. I think we ordered the wrong things. 

Gardenia is a cute homely dinner off of Freedom drive. The close at 9p everyday. Maybe the food will be better with a sit down service."}
{"text":"Not good food, even though it's cheap...sanitary rating was a 90.  Ordered the pot roast over rice that came with two sides and a drink. The pot roast was literally 3 slabs of questionable looking roast with carrots and gravy. Gravy was ok but the carrots weren't even cooked. The whole place had a nasty feel to it"}
{"text":"I work on the west side now and I forgot how many good quaint places there are to eat here. My first time eating here was on my lunch break alone, when I walked in i had no idea what to do. There was a line with people paying, no host, and people sitting. I am so silly but I didn't know if you order and pay at the line then sit and eat or what was going on. 

A nice waitress saw It was my first time and helped me. Pretty much you just sit down where ever you want.  So far the BLT is great alone with their potato salad. Their fried shrimp is spot on as well. My co workers like the chicken salad on a croissant, which looks divine. They have specials everyday and boy do they have a lot of choices. My favorite days are Tuesday through Thursday. No matter what day you go here though you will be able to eat really well for a really good price. 

The entire staff is very friendly so make sure to leave them a good tip. Caint beat this place that serves nice comfort food, that's fast and has quality. I cant wait to go back next week!"}
{"text":"Great place for an inexpensive home cooked lunch.  Service is always
quick and the food arrives hot.  The country style steak and beef tips are  the best around.    Portions have always been adequate and I've never left there hungry."}
