{"text":"This an amazing lunch experience in eating!! We drive across town to get there and will certainly be adding CG's to our regular lunch rotation! Great staff, clean environment, and then there is the FOOD! 

Need one of these in downtown Concord!!"}
{"text":"Very friendly folks. Tried the hot dogs today, good, love the buns. Nice shop, modern and clean. We'll be back to try the brisket!"}
{"text":"Seeing five stars on others Yelp reviews I had to see what all the fuss was about. The Wilmington brisket sandwich was tender and BBQ sauce was delicious. Baked beans very flavorful and filling. Highly recommend Charlie Graingers to anyone needing a BBQ fix!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't know how good it is.  Yet.  But I wonder how the hours are so narrow?  11-6?  I checked other locations and the same thing. How is this possible?"}
{"text":"Trying this place for the first time and everybody in the restaurant was very nice and helpful because it's a little different of a menu.
I liked it it was very very good."}
{"text":"Great place, I work nearby and their food always fills me up, I usually get the hotdog called the Mail man,  chili mustard and ketchup with fried onions  really good. Also the mac and cheese is like your best friends grandmas (sooo cheesey and good)"}
{"text":"Located with a gas station, this was worth the drive. I ordered the beef brisket sandwich. Soft strong bread and melt in your mouth beef. I like the coleslaw and baked beans. Great food."}
{"text":"A1 customer service, clean restaurant and good food! Does it get any better?? I was greated by the team as soon as I stepped in the door. Everyone was so friendly and patient(this was my first visit, so I took a little while looking at the menu) all food is made fresh daily, their chili is amazing and so flavorful. I got the Ray's way and the all the way hot dog combo. The Ray's way one was my favorite of the two. I will be back to try more options."}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch today and most of the staff were personable and informative about the menu. 

Service: 
There was one employee in particular who did not smile or even attempt to deliver a mediocre customer service experience, which was unfortunate. He came off as rude.

The manager and the gentleman with glasses, sorry for not knowing your name, were awesome! The stars that I did give were solely because of them.

Food:
The hot dogs were very light and pale in color and did not have flavor. My idea of a memorable hot dog experience involves a nicely grilled exterior, that has a classic bounce back texture once you take a bite, and a juicy flavorful center. I was hoping for delicious flavors like that of the Hebrew National or Sabrett brand hot dogs, but instead encountered a flavorless mystery meat.

If the unique hot dog is indeed meant to be the focal point, the bun must be reduced in size as it had way too much bread. Unfortunately, the toppings were also not flavorful.

I would suggest picking one major ingredient and executing it with laser precision.

I personally won't be back."}
{"text":"Food is over priced. No one knows what they are doing. They messy up half of our order. I've had better hot dogs from a hotdog cart.They have no kid friendly menu. There are so many choices that would be better in the area. We chose this place purely from the rave reviews on Yelp. I wanted to make sure and come here and set the record straight. I'll be surprised if this place still exists next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Great place for hotdogs.  Wish they were open  more hours but really. Good food.  Everything fresh and great staff"}
{"text":"First thing I notice is how clean this place is.  Service was great. The food was amazing. Everything was really really good. I got the brisket sandwich and it was sooooooooo good. My hubby got the Wilmington and he loved it. He said it had a little spice to it which made it even tastier. Definitely would come back and recommend this place"}
{"text":"Wow! Unreal food. We took a chance based on other reviews and we were not disappointed.  When you find out it's a hot dog place attached to a gas station you immediately think it's going to be sketchy and gross. Nope! Food was amazing and the decor was super cute. I got the Big Daddy, brisket with chili and cheese on top and it was sinful. My husband sampled a few hotdogs and he really loved them. As strange as it sounds, wasn't greasy at all!"}
{"text":"3rd visit here, in the lunch rotation to stay. Tried 2 new dogs today, all good.  Nice staff, clean inside, quick service."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  I tried the BBQ sandwich and it had so much flavor packed in that bun.  I loved the vinegar sauce and it had creamy coleslaw with pickled okra and pickles.  I'll definitely be back to try something else."}
{"text":"WOW this place is awesome. The restaurant is very clean and the staff is warm and friendly. The brisket sandwich was so good and the gumbo was killer!!! I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Found this gem on yelp and decided to give it a try for lunch.....wow! Menu choices are great and the brisket sandwich I settled on was amazing!"}
{"text":"Great hot dog place! A little unusual location though - it's attached to a gas station. But the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. We order several different dogs: plain, checkered flag, sombrero, Jamaican, and one of the local favorites. All were very good. The combos come with your choice of chips. No fries or other sides available."}
{"text":"This place is great! I am very picky and this place sold me! From there 100% sanitation grade to their cute dining set up and just good overall customer service!! I recommend this place. Oh and all the food is made fresh never frozen no fryers just good food!!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's off the beaten path. I actually found it after looking for someplace to eat after leaving the mall. I had a wildcat and the trails end. You can look those up on the menu I provided. The trails end was one of the best dogs I've ever had. It had everything on it and it was good. The only mishap I had was the guy that was ringing me up Must've been new because for 2 hotdogs chips and a drink it came to $17. Thank God one of the senior guys was there overlooking the transaction and he helped us out because it dropped down to $11. I appreciated that but if u don't want to pay those high prices for food at the mall give this place a shot. I'm going to tell u up front they don't have fries. (Only chips)"}
{"text":"We were really looking forward to a great hot dog. Unfortunately, these were some of the blandest hot dogs I've ever had. In fact they were almost white in color and the chili and toppings were just ok. We definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Super friendly folks , family owned and yummy food!! We all ordered hot dogs and can't wait to go back again soon to try the brisket!! Very impressed with the cozy atmosphere, and the cleanest bathroom I've ever seen in a restaurant!! WAY TO GO CHARLIE GRAINGERS!!!"}
{"text":"Simply amazing food. Cooked to perfection the beef brisket is something special.  All I can say is try it stop by and support your local restaurants. Places like this make a city with true passion for exceptional service and drop dead good food. You can't lose with picking anything on the menu as it's all cooked with love. 

We are hooked will be back for more...."}
{"text":"Surprise!  What a delight. One of the best hot dogs I have had in a long time!  Great food and great friendly service. Will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great people! Had the Wilmington and the Trails End, the brisket is off the hook good, topped with a fantastic slaw! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I was very intrigued by this high-rated restaurant only a couple of miles away so I went for lunch the other day and was very impressed! The franchise owner took my order and was very informative of the unique menu. Lots of different options with a lot of in-your-face flavors that work very well together. The restaurant itself is very clean with a revitalized, modern twist on classic Americana decor. Definitely worth a try and I'll be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I had the brisket sandwich with baked beans. The brisket was moist and full of flavor. The combination of  slaw and BBQ sauce was spot on.  The bun was a little on the stale side. The baked beans had allot of flavor but I wasn't a fan. Lots of brisket in them but too much raw onion and green peppers. For $3.95 I expected more I guess. I will try the hotdogs next time."}
{"text":"Been eyeing this joint from the road for a while. So glad I stopped! I will become a regular since they are so close to work. Service was fast and friendly and the brisket sandwich was delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT ! 
If you like Dawgs- this is mecca !
I don't live close - but will always swing by when possible. 
Can't wait to try the brisket....."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best brisket sandwich I have ever had.  Tender brisket, good slaw, pickled okra and BBQ sauce in a soft roll!"}
{"text":"Brought the kids here for a family lunch after a visit to Great Wolf Lodge. CGs has quite a few good reviews - so beep bop boop, we plugged it in the ol' Yelp GPS.

Our cashier was super friendly and patient - the menu can be a bit overwhelming your first visit - lots o' choices. BBQ, brisket, hot dogs and more. Luckily I cheated and looked at the menu before arriving and already knew I was going to try the Wilmington.

Sandwiches can be ordered as bowls (sans bread for the carb conscientious). Most, if not everything is made in house, including their Pimento Cheese.

$4.99 will get you a kids single hotdog meal with chips and drink - which were given a thumbs up by my kiddos.

The Wilmington was a delicious mess of a sandwich. Brisket, pimento cheese, Jamaica relish, pickled okra and on and on. A lot going on but somehow makes for a solid, tasty sandwich.

The BBQ bowl was solid - just wish it had been a little more tender.

The Coke Freestyle took a dive while we were there, but the owner gave me a bottled Coke to make up for it.

All the employees were genuinely nice and wanted to make sure you were happy!"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch yesterday. We tried a little bit of everything and it was all very good. The turkey salad that I had was amazing."}
{"text":"The food was fresh! Brisket was spot on! The peacock was a Hot Dog I've missed from my childhood!  And absolute spot to hit!"}
{"text":"Best hotdogs anywhere I can find. Their menu item hotdogs are too perfect to spice up with salt or pepper or even anything to satisfy your tastebuds! This place is a must to try out"}
{"text":"Although they are closed, I was never able to leave the review that I should have. It is very unfortunate that they are closed, customer service was awesome and the food was even better! Best of luck to the proprietors, and all the employees."}
{"text":"Definitely recommended! Super unique taste and flavorful. Friendly staff. Reminds me of a dive on food network."}
{"text":"So we've only been to Charlie Graingers the one time, this past Saturday. The food was awesome. The Wilmington was great. It consists of very tender chopped brisket with pimento cheese, relish, pickled okra. It was a gigantic sandwich. Two could probably share. The store was very clean and the staff was friendly. The owner was so sweet. We sat outside and she came and talked to us for a few. She's very excited about the business. And you can tell she loves people. Next time I'll get a hotdog. But if you go, get the Wilmington."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to stop here for a while just never had the time! Thankfully I had the time today! I am a huge fan of barbecue and the this is some of the best brisket I have ever had! Everything is made fresh everyday and you can definitely tell! 

I had the Little Scrappy sandwich. It's brisket, chopped pork, topped with Cole slaw and sweet molasses sauce! To die for!! My wife had a few of their hotdogs and she's very satisfied (she's a chef hard to please) and they looked amazing! 

The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable even checking on us frequently. We ate outside at their only patio table and they still came out to see if we needed anything and how we were enjoying the food! 

Stop by you won't regret it! Yum!"}
{"text":"Great lunch spot, the baked beans are amazing (topped w brisket!) and the chili dog with pimento cheese was delish!"}
{"text":"It's a rare thing to find an owner who takes pride in his menu and his business. This was very evident in the service, the flavor and the presentation of our lunch. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very clean to begin with they have a 100 grade for sanitation. The Trails End hotdog is amazing! Hotdog with brisket can't beat it. They have the create your own fountain drinks. This is not your typical hotdog bun either, it is a gourmet soft bun. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Very tasty, baked beans were on point. All around good,  highly recommend if you are just rolling through,  or want a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"The sign said \"best hot dogs in town\". I love Hot Dogs. Really good hot dogs. I tried the Charlie Granger hot dog. It has chili onions and mustard and slaw. Just the way I like it. It was incredible. One would think you had all the hot dogs you could possibly have and it couldn't get any better but it did. The mac and cheese side was incredibly good and did not taste like it was frozen period it was not that orange mac and cheese. It too was incredible. I loved that I could get diet dr. Pepper too . I know it seems silly to get a diet drink with what I just ate but I just prefer diet drinks. The atmosphere is really nice. Don't let the fact that it's next to a gas station for you. This place is incredible. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Don't let the fact that this is a small, hole in the wall store front connected to a gas station fool You!  The hot dogs are amazing, the brisket baked beans were savory, and the staff is super friendly.  
It's very clean, the food is fresh, and it's a great, relaxed atmosphere.  
Try the Mailman!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing Brisket, BBQ, hotdogs no more! I had \"The Wilmington\", Brisket, Pimento cheese, Jamaican relish, jalapeños, bbq sauce and slaw on a huge fresh roll served with pickles and pickled okra. The sandwich was great and filled me up. The service was excellent and the place was very clean and decorated well. The owners and their staff are all great people as well. Worth the stop, check them out!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Will be back. Warmly greeted when we walked through the door and the menu was explained. I ordered the Wilmington And my fiancé ordered a simpler sandwich. Service was fast & friendly. The food was fantastic home cooking from scratch. Great little hidden gem."}
{"text":"This Charlie Graingers is tucked away next to (as part of) a gas station but it still has the same vibe as the other locations.  It was pretty quiet on a Wednesday around 5:00 when I arrived.  Someday I certainly want to try their brisket but that afternoon as I was there for the hot dogs.  

I had a mailman (mustard, chili, crispy fried onions) and a charlie graingers (mustard, chili, slaw).  I liked both and would probably combine them next time by adding friend onions to the Charlie Graingers.

Service was quick and efficient.

Next time I'm passing through on 85, I'll definitely plan to stop back at CG."}
