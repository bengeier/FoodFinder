{"text":"It was amazing ! Fresh sushi and great service. I am very happy I decide last minute to try M&J. I will def be back"}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back again!  Atmosphere is lovely, specifically because of the handmade art from local artists that is spread all throughout the location! The waitstaff is also very attentive and friendly.  The drinks are fabulous. I tried a couple but my favorite by far was the 30 Seconds to Mars.  We had two appetizers, edamame and the calamari. Both were delicious. We tried two different kinds of sushi (I believe the one was called the M&J roll, which was very tasty). Lastly, we had the molten chocolate cake with cinnamon ice cream as dessert. AMAZING!  This is one of my favorite new places to dine in the Southside. Kudos to the owner!"}
{"text":"Update, still in love! I was so happy to discover that M&J offers take-out so I got a Godzilla Roll to go. I was curious if the quality would suffer for the sake of faster delivery but no doubts about it, my sushi on the run was still friggin amazingly fresh and delicious and still a very generous portion size. If you're looking for take out, be willing to wait because your patience will be REWARDED.  Also happy to see a brand new expanded menu (as of writing this the menu goes into effect next week) which includes Asian fusion BURGERS AND TACOS."}
{"text":"Excellent food with exceptional flavor! The ambiance is peaceful. The waitstaff was  good.  Sushi was above average! We will be back again and the Asian tacos were very good. Unlike anything I've had. Delicious! We ordered 13 rolls of sushi, soup, salad, tacos, appetizer, 2 drinks and had dessert for all under $100!!  We will return"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Super friendly waitress. Tasty turnip chips. Good flavorful sushi. Decent beer choices bottle n draft. Overall a good spot kind of overlooked from the shitshow that is E carson on the southside."}
{"text":"Nice sushi, great price! Fresh and easy. Happy hour always changing so ask before ordering."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to M&J Bistro yesterday for dinner around 6 oclock. We didn't even think of Happy Hour. We each ordered a signature drink. Mine was with Absolut Pear, Lime Juice, cider, and ginger beer. It was even better than a Moscow mule. I love it. My gf got a martini that she also loved. We ordered calamari, corn soup, a rainbow roll, pork dumpling things... Everything was great. The server also stated that for happy hour since we got a signature drink we could each get a California roll, or potstsickers. We got a free 1 of both. There was so much food. We got close to finishing it all. The service was quick. We were in and out in about 1 hr. The art work on the walls were also awesome. Great environment. A great place and different for the south side. We will be back. I hope others like it as much as we did."}
{"text":"Got stuck on the Southside on a Saturday afternoon trying to get food when most places weren't open. My wife and I ended up here and the food was great. The staff was very friendly. I would definitely recommend this little place."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on 1/18/2017 with a group of 5 co-workers. Everything was fresh, delicious, and hand crafted, not freezer food. The plating was also very nice, as was our waiter. I actually don't use Ketchup on my fries, and thus didn't ask for it. The owner/chef seemed to really get pissed about the waiter not bringing it to me, even though I didn't need it. I witnessed the chef reprimand our waiter, and wasn't too keen on seeing that. The waiter was super polite, always saying \"pardon my reach\", and \"thank you\". Another set of co-workers went today and had an equally awesome experience.  Steamed Pork Bun things - Killer, get that shit Bistro Burger - Fresh, quality ingredients, get that shit Chick Curry - Get that shit Egg Roll - Get that shit  All in all, get all the food"}
{"text":"The decor and atmosphere get you first. Very nice and calming. The Asian fusion food and ginger drinks are to die for. Good service. Good food and not overly crowded."}
{"text":"This was a great bar the bartender don was amazing you have to try the 30 sec to MARS drink omg!  you can bring a date meet up with the girls have apps the go party the nights away  So check this place out my yelpers"}
{"text":"This was easily one of the worst meals I've ever had in Pittsburgh. First, at 7pm on a Thursday there was one other group at the restaurant...that should have already told us how bad it was. First, I asked the waitress for a recommendation for a \"bubbly\" cocktail and she said they didn't have any special cocktail like that. I said, fine, can you just make something bubbly that's not a special. She said yes and then brought some terrible fruity drink that had nothing bubbly about it. Then (mistakenly) I asked her what her favorite dish was. She recommended the salmon with wasabi crust which sounded good. Turns out it was so bitter that I could barely eat it. One of the other members of our group ordered the eggplant (again after asking for a recommendation) and after 2 bites she stopped eating b/c it was inedible. Seriously, don't waste your time or money here and go somewhere with actually good food."}
{"text":"Overall very disappointing.  I was excited to have a new restaurant in southside but we will unfortunately never return.  We ordered the Scottish salmon, pepper steak, pork buns, forever 21 roll and Boston roll.    My dining partners got the salmon and pepper steak were barely one star worthy.   The miso soup that came with the salmon was inedible it was so salty.  The salmon had an odd taste and was overlooked.  The steak was the equivalent of steakums. The fried rice was soggy and disgusting.  Not sure how they could mess up fried rice this badly.  They did not finish their meals.    Sushi was ok, not super unique and definitely not worth coming back.   The service was good, you could tell the waitress was trying although she was not knowledgeable on the menu at all."}
{"text":"This place is so good. Definitely should be a destination stop in the southside! Affordable and the sushi is incredibly fresh. Service was amazing and the staff was so nice!!"}
{"text":"New sushi spot on the Ss! The food is on par with nakama and same with prices, but minus the necessary choice to do hibachi or squeeze at the sushi bar. More than just sushi, however that's all we tried! We got the crab rangoons- whatever the sauce is underneath is great! Also two house salads, love the mango ginger dressing. We split the tuna mango roll and the m&j both were amazing!!"}
{"text":"This place is great!! The sushi was SO good!! And the staff was very attentive and friendly. I've never had such fancy sushi before in my life! Will def be back!"}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try out this new sushi place for my friend's birthday, despite usually being pretty loyal to another sushi joint. It's a cool atmosphere with a fusion vibe and local art featured on the walls, which was a great look and idea.  The drinks were well made, although a bit overpriced.  After getting drinks, we weren't quite ready to order food yet, but the server took almost 20 minutes to come back for our order.  It then took very long again to actually get our rolls, which were brought out as they were made rather than serving the whole table at once. It was awkward to be the first person to get my rolls while we had to wait 5 minutes in between each person's order coming out  The quality of the sushi, I will say, was good, I got the Rainbow Roll and an Eel Roll. The special rolls weren't that special for the prices and I've had better sushi at a better price.  They were nice enough to offer a free dessert to my friend, and ended up bringing out creme brulee and cheesecake out with spoons for everyone to share. HOWEVER! My friend has a severe nut allergy so he asked if there were nuts in the cheesecake. The sever said no immediately saying it was a Lemon Cheesecake without consulting the chef. He ate it actively trying to avoid the crust, just in case, and instantly started swelling up in his face. He then told the server as a heads up that there are nuts in it and she said that she even confirmed it with the chef (after confidently telling us no). He ended up having to go home afterwards and was throwing up all night.  Despite it's incredibly convenient location for us, I don't think we'll be going back after our experience. We're just lucky that nothing worse happened to him."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE-    I just picked up food from here Togo where I ordered a Thai tea they served the drink to a table near me at the bar the table ordered a mango smoothie after they tasted the drink I ordered and brought it to there attention the bar tender took the drink form them and brought it over and gave it to me you have to be kidding me"}
{"text":"Had some really great sushi here.  The staff was incredibly attentive and super helpful.  The ambience was amazing.  This is definitely a must in the south side.  Upscale and worth the trip. Affordable and convenient. Love it!"}
