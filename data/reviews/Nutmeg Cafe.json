{"text":"Went yesterday and the vegan meal we had was excellent. Started off with organic split pea soup, followed it with beetroot wild rice biryani and finished off with blueberry cheesecake with ice-cream. Couldn't fault it at all. Elaine at front of house couldn't have been friendlier and the price was very reasonable.    We've been quite a few times and always been well satisfied."}
