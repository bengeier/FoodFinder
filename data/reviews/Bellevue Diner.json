{"text":"Stopped in with my son to get lunch on a weekend last month. We found a booth right away, which is nice. We sat for some time waiting to have our order taken and we watched while a waitress cleaned other tables before she took our order.  It wasn't busy. I ordered the greek salad and my son, a bacon cheeseburger.  The greek salad was a large portion but wasn't anything to write home about. Not much flavor. My son's cheeseburger was \"ok\" Our waitress didn't seem to have much \"flavor\" either and she didn't really seem to care about our dining experience. We sat for a while before we realized that we had to pay our bill up front.

I walked over to grab a fountain drink recently 15 minutes before closing, and the door was locked with customers inside. When I tried to open the door, that same waitress (the blond one) just looked over and then ignored me."}
{"text":"A basic diner, this place has a lot of character. It's owned by a Greek guy so they have a lot of Greek food options. The omelets are really good and so are the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Went here with my mum a few months back. Ordered a sandwich with only veggies (as I'm vegan) and the waitress had to ask for my order again literally 3 times and still got it completely wrong. She brought out a sandwich with eggs and I couldn't eat it. My mum ordered the pancakes and they weren't cooked through at all and were basically raw on the inside. Definitely won't be going here again."}
{"text":"this is real diner food. Breakfast is excellent from the grille. Eggs benedict have fresh scratch sauce and you can substitute mancini toast for muffins (Recommended). Omelets were big and full of goodies (3 choices before extra $  ),  HB potatoes were excellent. Mancini's toast is a plus for all egg dishes. 

My daughter said the homemade chicken soup is among the best and she has sampled LOTS of soup all across the country.   

Decor is what you expect of an old established diner and definitely NOT EAT N PARK. Love the fiestaware heavy plates and the funny mugs. Staff are friendly and always offer more  hot coffee, and do remember you when you come in again.

Worth a trip."}
{"text":"Stopped at Bellevue Diner after church for  breakfast today.  Will NEVER  go back.
Sat at a booth across from the grill one of the cooks sneezed in his hand and continued to pull sausage and bacon from the prep area to cut.  The other cook was eating food from the frig bins with his hands. ( No Gloves in Sight)  If this is what they do when people are watching, what do they do when no one watching."}
{"text":"Went there with a few friends a week or so ago for brunch. One got the breakfast burrito and it was HUGE. Seriously one of the biggest burritos I've seen. My other friend and I ordered eggs Benedict. She's a vegetarian and this place gets points for being able to substitute out the Canadian bacon at no cost. However, the hollandaise was sub par. I guess you get what you pay for. Both of us that ate the eggs Benedict didn't feel quite right later in the day. Over all good service and cute atmosphere, but the food is just ok.  Probably won't go back soon but would be willing to try again someday."}
{"text":"Out and about on a Sunday me and my boyfriend decided to check it out because neither one of us of been here before. Walking in ..were greeted. ..with a very friendly warm reception. Our waitress was super sweet and on the ball. There's plenty on the menu to choose from and I was torn on breakfast or a burger and I had really wished I got the burger..But went with breakfast instead. I think I'm just getting tired of breakfast.  There's no excitement on getting breakfast anywhere anymore I need to take a break.

I just got the two egg breakfast the bacon was crispy as requested .. scrambled eggs and hash browns..It was just as good as expected. I had to taste my boyfriends burger and it was so damn good .. he couldn't stop raving about it and he's a picky eater.   Not every diner has a good burger and this is one of the diners that has a pretty good burger.

We got the fried cheese sticks and they were pretty good the breading was cooked just right. ..They were fun to eat. 

Good food and great service we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Love the Bellevue Diner. I head there after some duck pin bowling at the K of C on Lincoln. Always a great meal."}
{"text":"All day breakfast, Home made style, super fast service gets 4 star ! Food quality was pretty good and reasonable price !"}
{"text":"Went in to eat to kill time. Best diner food i have had in a long time! I had the roast beef sandwich with fries, smothered in gravy. It was flavorful and so good."}
{"text":"After walking past numerous times I finally made the stop. I was greeted and seated quickly, and had my coffee and water within 2 minutes. I ordered the omelet with sausage, peppers and onions. My order was up within 5 minutes and I dug in. No skimping on the fillings here! No burn on the omelet either. The homefries and Mancinis toast (served buttered) were great as well. The place could use a little fix up, but the food and service needs none."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a couple of Tuesdays ago for lunch with my father.  We were looking for a nearby no frills place and this seemed to work.  Whenever we entered the restaurant it was easy to see that it looked like a traditional diner having a lunch counter on one side and a number of smaller booths on the other. 

After looking over the menu I decided to go with the Reuben sandwich with a side of onion rings while my dad went with the fish sandwich with a side of fries.  The first thing that I ended up trying was the onion rings and I have to admit that I was impressed.  They had a nice cornmeal like coating on them and were breaded so that you could tell they were onions, unlike many of those pre-made thick breaded ones.  The flavor and texture of them was good as they were crunchy and seasoned decently.  At this point I was thinking, wow this place is going to surprise me, but it was all downhill from there.  My reuben ended up being ok, it didn't have anything wrong with it but it was not terribly exciting either.  Then I tried my dads fries.  Soggy and limp, ugh, such a bad contrast from the onion rings.  When all was said and done the total cost for the sandwiches and sides mentioned with a single iced tea was $21.  That's a bit steep if you ask me.

The bottom line for me is that I might return here again in the future.  I thought that it was bit overpriced for the quality of food delivered but at least my onion rings were good."}
{"text":"Love this place. Friendly, fast service, everything I'd expect from a diner. Love the open concept grill/kitchen. Granted I've only been here for breakfast, a lot, I never leave wanting more."}
{"text":"Obviously this is going to be very basic since we visited for breakfast and got typical breakfast food. I ordered 2 eggs (egg beaters), bacon, and toast. My boyfriend had the 3 eggs overeasy, bacon,toast, and homefries. The bacon was really good quality and was thick and cooked perfectly for me . Eggs are eggs as is toast. His homefries looked delicious and were nice thick potatoes. He said they were very tasty. The coffee was very good as well which for me is essential for breakfast. I have lived in Bellevue a couple years now and this was my first trip into the diner. It has a counter and several booths with some tables in the back. Very typical 1950s like. So if anyone is ever near Bellevue and needs to grab a bite for breakfast, I would recommend stopping in! They also serve lunch which again seemed like typical diner fare. Coming here I feel is more for the unique diner experience rather than the spectacular (not saying it was not a decent breakfast) food."}
{"text":"Such a great \"greasy spoon\" diner. The portions are huge (I'm looking at you breakfast burrito and mixed grill) and delicious. I love that they serve coffee out of mismatched mugs that are from people's homes haha. My boyfriend had one the other day about how to be an awesome
Mom. The price point is less than $12 for all the meals from what I can remember"}
{"text":"This place is an awesome small town diner! The staff is friendly & genuinely tries to make connections with regulars. The kitchen is quick, but doesn't sacrifice the quality of the food. 
I highly recommend the mixed grill, especially if you're hungover!"}
{"text":"This little spot is a classic diner setting with classical Diner favorites like Pancakes, Waffles, and French Toast on the Breakfast menu along with all American favorites such as Burgers and Fries.  Try the Home Fries for a real treat and unlimited coffee refills!"}
{"text":"The food is great, quality diner food. Benedict dish has real house-made hollandaise sauce. The kitchsy mis-matched mugs and fiestaware plates are a nice touch.

However, the space needs a make-over. It looks old and a bit worn-out. Replacing the ceiling tiles with a lay-in tin (or even a new lay-in panel) would help a lot.

4 stars for food, 2 stars for atmosphere."}
{"text":"Living in Bellevue, this is our favorite stop for breakfast, when we don't feel like making it ourselves or travelling too far away to get something.  This is definitely a diner, and the food is what you would expect from that.  There is nothing wrong with any of the flavors or meals they provide.  It is definitely a solid meal.  The service is always good and fast, and since we can walk here, we frequent it pretty often.  I can't say anything about other meals, but their breakfast is pretty good, and I will continue to eat it as long as I live in the area."}
{"text":"They weren't very busy when we walked in around 11:30 on a Sunday morning. The staff was very friendly and the coffee was really good. My wife got poached hard eggs. She had to send them back because they were runny. The second time they were fine though. I got an omelette. The ham was good, but it could have used more cheese. All in all we'd eat there again but wouldn't go out of our way to get there. It probably won't make our Sunday morning diner rotation. One thing we did really like, though, was the mismatched coffee mugs. It was a cool touch. Plus they weren't baby sized."}
{"text":"Wonderful omelets, so fluffy and delicious! You can build your own with your favorite ingredients. The omelets are huge and perfectly seasoned. You've got to try one! Fast and friendly service in a very clean and comfortable spot. Burgers are the best! Freshly made and perfectly prepared. We just found a new favorite on Lincoln Ave. in Bellevue. An exceptional diner! Great spot!"}
