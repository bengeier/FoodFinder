{"text":"been coming here for years, kind of a dated restaurant in its decor but i like it.  good food and a lot better option that many of the chain restaurants....  will continue to come back.  pizza is great.  great staff as well"}
{"text":"I've only been to the lounge. The room is quite small with a lot of VLTs and 1970s decor. They play the background music very quietly, so when the lounge is not too busy, you can hear other people's conversations which can be a bit awkward if you want to keep to yourself.  Also many of the patrons seem to know each other and the bartenders, and are often talking to each other across the room. However, everyone is very friendly and the place feels comfortable. I've always had great service, even on busy nights.  The food is outstanding. I usually get a pizza to share with my friend. It is a thick style pizza which is always filling and fresh. For the two of us, a medium is often enough, though sometimes we get a large if we are hungry or want a couple of extra slices to take home.  I recently had the French onion soup, which did not disappoint. It contained A LOT of cheese on top, almost too much. The broth tasted homemade and was not overly salty. The soup was topped by croutons that had a bit of a garlicky flavour. IIRC, it was around $4-5 and definitely worth it."}
{"text":"The outside looked nice. We were all like \"Let's go inside!\" Then when we got in it turned out to be an ill favored dump. The waiter was nice but had big grungy finger nails. Pizza was so-so crab artichoke appetizer was horrid due to the fact it was icy cold in the center and the crab meat seemed to be synthetic. I would not visit again you could get better food at Wal-Mart. Do not go here."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for many years.  It is always very good.  They welcome you in and let you choose where you want to sit.    We have our favourite dishes and a couple not so good ones .  Their pizza is so good and so are the pasta's.  Salads and desserts are not.  They have a wing special on Monday.    The customer service is extraordinary.  The best in the city. It is family owned and run.  You can watch them run and service tables perfectly.  Other restaurants struggle to provide this service.  Great atmosphere.  Décor is old style and clean.  Comfy seats and tables.  Great location and lots of parking."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a whim.  We ordered the pizza, it was good but pricey...$18 for a medium (not enough for a hungry group of two plus a preschooler...should have ordered the large).   Food was good but I would probably not be a regular because it is pricey for what you get. Would consider going more frequently if pizza was 25% less...now just not great value for my money.  Dining area was clean. Got a few stares because we were probably the youngest people in the joint. Average age was probably 70 or so. Was definitely an interesting dining experience!  There is a lounge attached. The lounge offers some food specials on certain days of the week. Seems like restaurant does a lot of take-out orders.  Decor like mentioned in other reviews is dated but restaurant is clean and dining area/washrooms are maintained. Service was friendly.  If you are in the area, I would say, try it out"}
{"text":"We've lived in Acadia for years and finally decided to try the pizza from here. The pizza is a thicker crust and thicker toppings. We ordered 2 pizzas and it was close to $50. We still prefer Matador pizza in the NW but when we aren't in the mood to drive that far, Starlite is a fine choice."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for a impromptu dinner while the child had soccer practice at a nearby school. As I could see VLTs from the parking lot we didn't know what to expect.  When you go through the doors you have a choice of the lounge (where the VLTs live) or more of a \"family restaurant\" style dining room. We opted for the latter. While the decor was kind of dated and could use some love, it seemed relatively clean. We were seated quickly and it seemed pretty busy for the time/day of the week. There were retired folks, families and a couple of younger couples.  The men is varied with pizzas, sandwiches, pastas and \"main\" entrees. We didn't really know what to try so we both got sandwiches. They were average, fresh and the fries that came with them were quite good. I had a ham and cheese on a croissant and it was tasty aside from the ham essentially being a pretty low grade cooked ham. Kind of pricey for what it was by a couple of dollars but what can you do?  I'd try the Starlight again for perhaps their pizza as reviews elsewhere I read afterwards indicated that they do a great job of that. This isn't a place to go out of your way for, but if you are in and around Acadia and are looking for some simple food, check it out."}
{"text":"So good! ! Great pizza. Great food.  Great pizza. Place is dated and needs some renovation but very clean. Always good service. ..always good pizza. Love it to take out or to sit down and have a meal. Been going for years."}
{"text":"Pizza's OK but don't order Fish & Chips, can buy better at Safeway. Really the worst I've ever had at a restaurant...ever!"}
{"text":"Great service! We go here quite often for a pitcher of Keiths and wings. WISH they had wings on Friday nights (only Mon & Sat) they hands down have terrific pizza and the steak sandwiches are ALWAYS cooked to perfection. The garlic bread is the best I have ever had and we always get some to go and the potato skins are LOADED with cheese and bacon- Yum! The staff is terrific and always prompt....There is definitely a \" neighborhood watering hole\" kind of vibe to it and A LOT of regulars. If your looking for a casual/unpretentious place to grab a beer and bite, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This cute little restaurant has been in the location for as long as I can remember.  The decor is a little outdated but it goes with the menu that also needs updating as both haven't changed since the restaurant opened.  I don't mind the decor because it reminds me of a small town restaurant and the seniors in the area who have been coming for years love it but you can make some changes to the menu.  They do not carry anything spicy! My Mom loves spicy stuff on her pizza and was asking for banana peppers, jalapeños, anything to put on her pizza but nothing!  Overall, go here for pizza :)"}
{"text":"I LIKE this place. Sure, it's stuck in the '70s - they have liver and onions still on the menu and they may have just replaced the original carpets with hard flooring, but it has character!  This is part of the \"hub\" of Acadia - the only lounge unless you cross Heritage, they definitely  have their VLT regulars' crowd here.  They also may have a regular named 'Sasquatch'.   But why I enjoy Starlite is for their PIZZA! YAYYYYY Pizza. It is very good.  Don't come here for a fine dining experience, come here to embrace the lounge lizard ambiance or to go back in time with the menu or if you want to eat with your kids on the restaurant side cause you are too busy to cook and want someone else to pour you water for you.  Actually, I don't know if they even do that, but have a look at the cocktail list and see if you can recognize anything."}
