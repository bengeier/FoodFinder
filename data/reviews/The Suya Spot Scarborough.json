{"text":"This is 3.5 stars. I'll round up.  The bad: * Food came very slowly. * If it takes that long, it should be piping hot, right out of the oven, pan, pot, whatever. It was not. It was somewhat hot. * The chicken was dry instead of the desired moist and tender. * The beef was tough. * Goat was not available that day. * The rice was also not hot and was average in flavour: nothing special  The good: * Customer service was good * Cold drink was very cold and price for it was $1 not $1.50, $1.75 or $2.00 like other places * I like the what-you-see-is-what-you-pay pricing * The marinated flavour was nice but too subtle or the imperfect texture distracted from it  Conclusion: I can see this having the potential to be great food that you crave but the execution was just not there at least when I visited. The person working there seemed to be very nice so I hope the above improves and the place prospers."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and well made. Mike has great customer service and super invested in explaining the menu so you know what you are ordering. I tried chicken, goat and beef and loved all three. I had to give him credit on the jollof rice (even though it was hard for me as a Nigerian to admit how delicious the rice was...if you know about the jollof rice wars you understand). I would definitely come back here. Thanks Mike!!!!"}
{"text":"Was mr mikes . They still serve pizza, but added a whole African BBQ menu. First time for 'suya'. And it was delicious. Buddy took care of me and gave me an assorted amount. We also had a poutine pizza, which delivered exactly what was expected. Highly recommended. Thanks Buddy! See you soon."}
{"text":"hands down my favorite place to visit any and every time I'm in TO. goat x beef suya + jollof is pictured."}
{"text":"I have no prior experience with suya, so I really can't say whether this is good or bad suya, but it was tasty. Suya is some variant on grilled meat. I tried beef, goat, liver, and tripe. I didn't like the liver, but I never like liver, so that's not saying much. The beef was dry, the goat was not super dry but could have been more tender, and the tripe was my favorite, I think. It's not super cheap at $10-$12 for what's basically like three or four small skewer's worth of meat, but it also isn't super expensive. For whatever reason, of the four of us who got goat, only mine was boneless. I'd rather it had bone because that helps keep things juicy.  They also do poutine. The large is the most worth it at about $2-$3 more than the small. It's a huge box. It could have done with smaller cheese curds (smaller, not less) and the chicken bits on my gourmet poutine were on the dry side, but all in all, not bad for the price ($11).   I also tried the moi moi (bean pudding) and I rather enjoyed that. It was smokey and bean-y and supposedly had dried seafood in it. I saw shreds of what looked like protein, but I wouldn't have any clue what it was.  Not bad, but be prepared to wait. They opened at 2pm today. They were also not serving jollof rice and plantains when we went, so our carb options were quite limited."}
{"text":"Stopped by to try this suya Ive been hearing about for a few years now. Ive heard not so good things about the joloff rice so wasnt planning on getting anything beyond suya. But fantastic service from Mike changed my mind. He took care of us and hooked us up with some great suya, joloff and plantain. Definitely going back again. Usually hate Nigerian joloff but the fusion twist takes it to a better level. Thanks a lot Mike!  Tip: Get the pepper sauce on the side cause it's hotttt"}
{"text":"This is the spot to go to for Suya . Even though I live in Rexdale I ll still make the drive to Scarborough. To get me Suya from this place. Word of advice call ahead to order."}
{"text":"I am very impressed with this restaurant. Mike the owner is amazingly professional, patient and courteous. With regard to patience, he was very thorough in explaining the entire menu as I had a lot of questions. Regarding professionalism, he was very prompt in providing service and notifying us about the length of time to expect our food. Lastly, regarding courtesy, he was exceptionally polite and informative not only as it regards to food but we are tourists from the US and he was quite helpful in informing us of local tourist sites.  P.S. the restaurant was also clean and the food presentation was visually pleasing.  I would definitely come back to this wonderful restaurant when I visit Toronto!"}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. The owner gave us a lesson on where the food is from and how it's made. Very friendly and professional. Suya is essentially slow roasted meat, it's spicy and dry to an extent. Definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"Ordered a small beef and a small chicken.  The chicken was delicious but the beef was too chewy/dry."}
{"text":"Ordered the goat and chicken suya with a side of plantain.   Goat was perhaps a little too well done but the overall flavor and char from the grill was perfect.  Best to split the suya with another person; it's a lot of meat for one person.   Overall this place is perfect when you're trying to satisfy a meat craving."}
