{"text":"Small family owned and operated place with good food at great prices!  Give them a try."}
{"text":"Like every restaurant, you have to know what to order. If you're order American style dishes, like Orange Chicken, etc., it's going to be subjective and compared to what you've tried and considered to be \"orange chicken\". 

However, if you know Chinese food, then you're best bet is to stick with Chinese style dishes, which will consist of vegetables and soy or bean based sauces. I tried the orange chicken, b/c I like Panda Express' version, and it doesn't compare. However, I tried the beef with vegetable, Egg Foo Young, and Shrimp with Lobster Sauce and I was happy with the food for the price. It's definitely the better Chinese food spot around, including Scottsdale.

Of note, It's take-out or delivery ONLY.  Try their egg fried rice, not the fried rice that comes with the combo meal. The Orange Chicken is served with the sauce on the side."}
{"text":"Have been going here for years...Food is great..fresh and tasty... I was surprised first time I walked in..your basically standing at the counter in the kitchen watching them cook ur food.  Mr. & Mrs. Kim are always nice and friendly.   Coming from the east coast it was hard to find good chinese food in Phoenix, but everyone I introduce to this place is hooked!!  only downside is they are cash only..."}
{"text":"I don't live in Phoenix area. I was at the Phoenix Children's Hospital with my son. We didn't really care for the cafeteria food there and we decided we wanted to order for delivery if that was possible. I called this establishment and they were so nice over the phone and we're absolutely willing to deliver to the hospital. I ordered two orders of the barbecue spareribs and I ordered two rice bowls. I got three eggrolls one was for free with their coupon. I would have to say they're very nice over The phone and very accommodating to my needs. The food arrived and it was amazing! The egg rolls were delicious the spareribs were great! I would definitely advise eating here."}
{"text":"DOES NOT serve dim sum- only chinese takeout. Had to put the stars (I did not eat there) otherwise I cannot leave this comment."}
{"text":"This is a little take out hidden gem!!! The crab wontons and Mongolian beef are tasty. This is not a fancy place, it is a little family owned place with good food at great prices. If you are looking for the next PF Changs this is not your place but if you are looking for a good meal I highly recommend it. Chris"}
{"text":"I didn't like the fried rice. I asked for
More eggs they didn't give it to me and they're restaurant is crowded and messy.. no air conditioning I like King Wong better... better food,friendly and better service"}
{"text":"A few people at work were ordering from here and I figured I may as well try it again.  Last year I had pretty bad teriyaki chicken from here (yes, I know it's Japanese but coworkers erroneously said it was good), but chalked that up to ordering the wrong thing.  

I noticed that they use the \"cheap\" packaged soy sauce, as opposed to REAL brewed soy sauce.  I did not care for the taste when drizzled on the rice.

The sweet and sour chicken was almost inedibly salty.  Definitely on the extremely high level of sodium content.  Texture was squishy and not crunchy/fluffy/chewy enough.  Decent sized portion, and the sauce was on the side.  At least it want bland?

The orders of crab rangoon and fried won ton were both good.  Very little meat in the won ton, but at least the crab rangoon order wasn't chock full of onion.

The rice wasn't sticky and fresh.  It seemed a little old and dry.

I wouldn't recommend this place unless you really want at-or-slightly-below Panda Express level American Chinese food delivered.  Sadly, I've yet to find a higher than three star Chinese restaurant in Phoenix, and east valley restaurants won't deliver this far!

Giving them the two stars for convenience of delivery along with the pretty decent won ton and rangoon."}
{"text":"Amazing to-go and delivery!  Have never had a bad experience.  Great people that are always happy and friendly."}
{"text":"Tried it based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  Made a special trip there just to try it.  I figured if I loved it, I will have discovered a great chinese place which is very scarce in the valley.  I got: 

Chicken fried Rice: Was just ok. Missing scallions, bean sprouts.  Good amount of chicken
Orange Chicken:  just ok.  missing orange slices and the peppers which usually accompany  this spicy dish
Egg Flower Soup:  Just ok. Not enough salt.  No noodles accompanied it which is the usual with chinese soup
Shrimp with lobster sauce:  OK.  I asked for it to be in a white sauce which they did do; however, excessive carrots made the sauce too sweet.
No brown rice was available for purchase.  
Lovely people, ok food, definitely over-rated. 
will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great food with lots of options. Awesome owners and customer service. Carry out only right now but they are looking to expand."}
{"text":"This place is the best Chinese I've had in ages! The portions are huge and for a great price! I ordered the Kung pau chicken and it came with lots of delicious veggies. The guys who work there were super nice and helpful"}
{"text":"I have been on the hunt for years for a really good Chinese restaurant that won't break the bank. Yesterday, after the movies, we were craving Chinese. I yelped \"Chinese\" near the location where we were. A couple of good choices came up. Drove to the first choice....and it was closed!!! It is rush hour and I don't want to drive and I am frustrated that our first choice is closed.  We decided to look a little closer to home and up popped Kim's...3 blocks from our house....in a nondescript strip mall that I drive by everyday. Upon entering we saw that it is take-out and delivery only and the menu is pretty standard. It is obvious that it is a family run business...which appeals to me. We placed our order and waited. We got the house Lo Mein, barbecued ribs, pork Lo Mein, egg rolls, and a spring roll. As an added bonus, they gave us an order of crab rangoon. Got home and settled in and unpacked our food. The food appeared appealing and plentiful. The fried items were fresh tasting and flavorful. The Lo Mein was chockful of meat and crisp vegetables, and the sauce was yummy. I intend on being a regular customer!! It was simply good and fresh and in the budget."}
{"text":"There is no dining in. However, Kim's is the best take out or delivery food. I know what good Chinese food is, and this is by far, the very best!"}
{"text":"In spite of the name on the glass facade, they do not  (or no longer) make dimsum. In fact, the main exterior signage just says, \"Kim's Chinese Food.\" It's a regular take-out place that serves good, standard Chinese take-out dishes. It's strictly take-out, no dine-in."}
{"text":"Kim's is the best in town. You can get takeout or have your food delivered. The foodis delicious and the people that own Kim's are great!  I've been eating at this restaurant on and off for about 17 years. Try the pork fried rice it's always so delish. The Kung Pao chicken is so flavorful and full of veggies and chicken.  If you want delicious chinese food this is the place. The food and service is stellar!"}
{"text":"The deliveryman was so nice I had to pinch myself and make sure I hadn't accidentally wandered into some black & white, Hitchcock inspired, Pleasantville, Twilight Zone situation. I was like, did I just step back into 1952 where everyone had to function within the confines of extreme politeness? 

Nope. The Kim's people are just that awesome. I'm pretty sure I've never been this impressed with the delivery of anything. Guess I found my go-to place for noodles and egg rolls."}
{"text":"It's a must if you live int he Arcadia area. Pretty authentic cheap chinese food.  Don't pass on the crab rangoons."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Chinese food in the Phoenix area! Delivery is super quick and the delivery guys are nice and friendly . You can get a lot of food here and great prices!  The soups are addictive ! And I have never had a bad experience yet . Unlike some other Chinese food restaurants in the area. Go Kim's"}
{"text":"This Restaurant literally right behind my house so they bring it to my back gate...The food is amazing...the free sides..the service and kind men on the phone...The food is yummy and not greasy at all..It is a mom and pop shop which I love..They are open all the time ans I can NOT say enough good things about them......


Thanks...Evelyn and Hans"}
{"text":"I love the food here and so will you. The family that owns the restaurant are great people and are truly dedicated to their craft. This is the only place I'll go to for Chinese  take out in the Valley. 10/10"}
{"text":"Fast...FAST!!!!...delivery. Great food. Love the beef egg foo young, sweet and sour chicken, and the kung pao veggies. And the delivery guy is HOT!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good but having gone twice and ordered 5 different dishes, I think there have only been three recipes...the menu may double many dishes under different names, or or order got messed up.  
Either way the food is great!  The best Chinese food in the area that we have tried"}
{"text":"Favorite Chinese food in Phoenix Area! Family owned, extremely friendly staff and the food is authentic. Not to mention the area they deliver has a wide range. Would recommend 100 %"}
{"text":"It was very good food, i mean for the price you are actually getting good food, i had orange chicken and crab ragoons were awesome!! I will definitely order again, delivery service fast enough !! Keep it up"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good! Had the orange chicken and some shrimp fried rice. The delivery guy was pretty cool as well. However, if it matters to you, this place doesn't devein their shrimp. I figured this out while eating the fried rice. And though it doesn't cause any health issues, it may be good for someone to at least know what they're getting."}
{"text":"Work in the Phoenix area my co-worker was feeling like chinese food and I found this place by accident. The food is really flavorful and good. The customer service was amazing and the wait time and delivery were way faster than projected."}
{"text":"My Curry chicken, Pork Low Mien and my wife's Chung Pao Chicken and Crab Rangoon were great and delivered in 24 minutes by a cheerful driver.
We appreciate the very low salt content and will continue using this great resource.

{"text":"I will never order take out or eat in this establishment again.  It was the grossest, worst-tasting Chinese delivery I have ever had.  I had simple items as well.  I ordered egg flower soup which was terribly awful , house fried rice which was mediocre, and orange chicken which was flaccid and floppy.  

Please save your money and your taste buds!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved it. SO close to where I reside so it's ultra-coo now i'm hooked on their chicken fried rice. Quick service, my order was ready for pick-up in 5 mins! :D satisfied. It was yummy, hot and fresh!! pick-up or delivery only and cash only."}
{"text":"Just had delivery from DoorDash. Sweet and sour pork, egg roll, wonton soup and pork chop suey.
Egg roll was good. Won ton soup ok. The first bite of sweet and sour pork was just a piece of fried coating. Not a good start. After that it was tender pieces of pork. It had an unpleasant old oil taste.
The pork chop suey was very good. Nice tiny pieces of lots of different types of vegetables and the pork is tasty. They really smoke the pork. I think for now I would stick to their non-fried vegetable dishes that include the BBQ pork."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of chinese takeout, and having lived in the Biltmore area for some time and trying nearly everything in a 10-mile radius, I have to give a shout to Kim's Chinese. So it's not much to look at, and they (thankfully) only do takeout and delivery, but the food is solid, prices are great, and service always friendly (they don't balk at special requests or charge extra for it). Love their house fried rice!"}
{"text":"Great delivery! When I called, the person who took my order was super helpful, and my meal was delivered quick, hot and delish!"}
{"text":"The Kung Pao Chicken was incredibly tasty and an awesome value. Can we take a moment to talk about the apps? They're all delicious, but especially the egg rolls. Consider me hooked."}
{"text":"The food at Kim's is amazing. Best crab rangoons(sp?) I've ever had!! Very fast delivery and very good prices! I have been ordering from them for 5+ years and wont stop :-)"}
{"text":"I didn't actually eat here. I came because I love dim-sum and it was close to my home. Unfortunately, they don't actually serve dim-sum and the sign outside says they're actually just \"Kim's Chinese Food\" instead of \"Kim's Dim-Sum Chinese Food.\" Bummer."}
{"text":"This place is great, the people are friendly and make your order quickly and deliciously. It doesn't look like much when you step in, it's just a kitchen with a counter in front and you can see Kim cooking your food. I've tried a lot of the items on the menu and like most of them. My family LOVES the pot stickers, they are very good. I tend to judge all Chinese restaurants on the quality of their chicken fried rice and Kim's is great, I usually get it every time. My absolute favorite thing to get here is the BBQ pork slices, they are so tender and juicy and the sauce Kim drizzles on top is outstanding. Kim is an amazing cook and can cook poultry like no other. Not the cleanest looking place but it's an old building and they are very good about keeping everything clean and healthy. Overall great food, good prices and friendly people; I recommend this place to all my family and friends."}
{"text":"Very good food .  Love the hot and sour soup and orange chicken.  Only take out and delivery but worth going in to pick it up.  Very friendly owners too."}
{"text":"I ordered a large takeout of shrimp broccoli and it tastes sooooo good! Their customer service was good as well. The workers were very nice. Prices are reasonable. I do see myself coming back here in the future. Highly recommend. The food was ready when I got there. I probably got there 10 minutes after they said my order would be ready but my food is still warm. Love this place."}
{"text":"Amazingly fast. And probably the best Chinese food I've ever had. Best cream cheese wontons ever!. It's a shame that was just visiting that side of town and I don't live there. I would eat it as often as I could."}
