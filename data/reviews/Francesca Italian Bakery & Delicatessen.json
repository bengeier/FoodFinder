{"text":"1st time I ever had a rice ball was here. Its so yummy. I call ahead and make special trips for the creme brulee."}
{"text":"A family member brought me here to grab some pastries for a quick breakfast.  There were so many yummy options,  I had a hard time deciding- but ended up getting a ricotta danish- that was so delicious! The pastry was flaky and buttery SO GOOD.  The ricotta filling was silky smooth and not too sweet with just enough chocolate chips to add some texture.  The nutella filled donut and croissant were also great- as well as the regular sugar donut & peach danish. We also grabbed a loaf of french bread that seemed tough before we cut into it, but we were definitely surprised at how soft it was inside!  Would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I never take the time to write reviews regardless if the service was good or bad. I've found insects and foreign objects in my food and I still don't write reviews but today is a special day. This evening I went to Francesca's to pick up some dinner. The customer before me took the majority of what was left of the pasta. There was less than half a small box of pasta left so I asked what could be done. She said she would give me a $2 discount off of the $6. While she tried to tell me that there was a lot of pasta left left, I had just watched her pack a small box full. I asked her if she could just pack it with what was left of a small piece of dried up lasagne,  she said she would ask her manager.  Her manager came back and said no discount not even the $2. By the way, the pasta had been sitting out all day and look quite dry but hey I didn't want to cook.  Anyway I left without purchasing the food given the rude service I received. I know it's their right whether or not to discount the food but as a customer that has bought numerous cakes, sweets and lunches there, I will never return. Instead I will go to Gerhard Cafe on Bellemy instead for baked goods. Their cakes are better anyway.   http://www.gerhardscafe.ca  I gave 2 stars because their pistachio cake is pretty delicious but this is not the first time I received poor customer service at this business."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time with my BFF. I always drive by it but never went in. Now I'm a regular! They have AMAZING desserts in there! If you haven't gone there, GO! What are you waiting for?!?!  I felt like a kid at a candy store the first time I walked in. They have your basic gelato flavours and they are sinfully delicious. You can buy different types Italian bread there along with individual and whole cakes, pastries, cookies and the list goes on. The one thing you MUST try is their fresh Cannoli's . Also their macaroons are pretty good as well!  Definitely a loyal customer for life!"}
{"text":"Delicious Italian quick eats like arancini, various pasta and parmesan, meatballs etc that you can take out or eat in. Of course I should mention their fabulous selection of baked goods from bread to cakes to cookies and more! They sell out of their popular items quick so best to go early. Service is very friendly."}
{"text":"Went by for lunch had lasagna(cold and small) had to ask for sauce didn't bother with cheese too much of a hassle for person serving  me.  Veal sangwich  (tasteless) no sauce  very dry one piece of veal . Very expensive $18 with a coke won't be going back.   Lamanna's  excellent hot food and you get a lot more for less ."}
{"text":"Popped in here for an espresso and it was very strong.  My friend enjoyed some of the gelato which she said was quite filling, and the medium cup holds a lot of gelato.  Nice atmosphere and the food looks very fresh.  I didn't purchase any of the food, so I can't comment on that.  Staff where nice and the coffee was strong :)"}
{"text":"Italian cake I bought from there was very fresh and very tasty  when i picked up my cake i couldn't resist trying one of their arancini. ...very nice indeed. I'll go back there for sure."}
{"text":"Eat here regularly, and your jeans are going to fit a little tighter. Eat here for life, and you are going to have some major spill-over, haha. This is a testament to how great this place is.  Their lunch hot table is just fabulous. Pasta specials rotate day to day, and it is difficult to anticipate when your favourite dish will be up. I personally love the Ricotta stuffed Shells, and Penne a la Vodka. Come on Angelo, can we get a pasta schedule going? :)  Sometimes when I need lunch in a pinch, I pickup their Prosciutto and Roasted Vegetable Sandwich with Fresh Mozzarella. I split it with my mom so I don't feel guilty eating it, but truth be told, that one is packing the calories! If you go on a Thursday, they make their sandwiches on fresh baked Focaccia. Speaking of which, all their breads are made in-house. How amazing is that?  Their sweet case showcases a variety of cookies, cakes, and individually portioned desserts which are all reasonably priced. My favourite is the Ciambelle, an Italian Sugar Doughnut that is literally the size of my head. My jaw dropped to the floor the first time I had one of these because 1) It was only 80 cents, and 2) It was one of the best doughnuts I had ever eaten.  Hands down, the best place to takeout Italian food in Scarborough!"}
{"text":"Great spot for an Italian lunch! They have a variety of foods offered at lunch time for a great price! You can find chicken or veal sandwiches, a few different types of pastas, salads, and vegetables!   Their desserts are also amazing!"}
{"text":"The food is alright nothing spectacular except their $$-$$$$ pricing depending on what is ordered. Eg. Their baked goods & cookies are EXTR. Overpriced as well as their Pantalones $19.99-65.99?!!! Huh what the hell why? Cookies 10.99-45.99/kg. Same reactions huh.... Etc.?!!! You go ahead & buy/try & let me know what is all the fuss & expense? Too much for my taste. Oh yeah they are selective to give out their wifi usage p.w. Try one day & another day. They are trying to be cheap with their service even though it seems that they are not hurting. Their Italian/ non Italian customers are plentiful prosperous eg. Many luxury cars pull up every am or evening. I see the mini parking lot EXTR. Busy when I am going to work early in am & back from. Good luck & try to enjoy yourself. Service is quite friendly with a few helpers behind the counter but cashiers are hit & miss...!"}
{"text":"It was our first time ordering from here. We ordered a \"vanilla eggless cake with chocolate filling\" over the phone and I repeatedly said \"Vanilla cake\". When we picked up the cake, it looked perfectly fine. When we got the cake and I tried to put a candle into it, it wouldn't go in. It was like I was hitting something hard within the cake. I didn't think much of it. My sister tried to cut it and the whole cake started moving. We have never experienced this before though. After 5 minutes she finally managed to cut through a slice. We're looking at the cake and you can't call it a cake. It was all brown and had wafers in it like as if they put some sort of cereal in it. We figured it looked like our cake from the outside but maybe they perhaps mixed the order. We were so excited to have this cake because of the previous one I had tried which was the only reason I thought to give this bakery a try. We waited until today to call and inquire as to what happened to the \"eggless vanilla cake\" we specifically ordered. I mean when you think cake, don't you think moist soft sponge cake? The manager \"Vince\" tells me that for an eggless sponge cake it takes 2-3 days and so I asked if that was the case then why was I offered to have my \"eggless cake\" made within 3 hours and why wasn't I told this in my original call yesterday? He said the cake I was given, is some sort of premium cake with pastry like wafer filling and is what I ordered; when ofcourse I didn't. If the person taking my order had mentioned anything about wafers I would've said no thank you. I mean I could have gone else where and got an eggless cake that is for real a cake and not this cardboard mess. I explained it was my first time ordering from their bakery because of their long time customer who convinced me to go here. The lady taking my order could have explained the cake I was ordering had wafer like things but she didn't, even after I said I wanted an eggless vanilla cake numerous times. I asked him if these wafers or pastry comes in vanilla and he says no, if that's the case then when I was repeatedly saying vanilla why didn't the lady over the phone tell me they don't have actual eggless vanilla cakes? He refuses to make a replacement cake unless I pay another $13 even though I've already paid $25 for that cake which is now just sitting in our fridge. It looks unappetizing and questionable. That's not what we ordered and the manager knows it's their mistake on their part in terms of communication and still refuses to replace the cake. Instead he keeps hanging up or puts us on hold or picks up and won't say anything and then hangs up. The owner refuses to speak on the phone because he clearly knows it's their mistake. How do you run a business like this? I've never ever had such a bad customer experience ever anywhere. It is so sad because I know they did make good cakes but to not honour their mistake. When I called back and spoke to a different lady she is telling me and explaining everything the way the first girl should have and in which case I would have never bothered to order a cake in the first place. Who wants a cardboard cake? Vince keeps saying he backs his girls and he knows they did right. So I asked him you think that not telling a new customer that is ordering for the first time that their eggless cakes comes in two types one being wafer and one sponge but we're specifically ordering a wafer isn't important?  This would have cleared it all up yesterday. The manager says it makes him nervous when he has to repeat himself over and over again but I never asked him too. How do you feel nervous and tell a customer that when you're trying to problem solve? Are you even fit to be a manager? My sister calls and he tells her she can talk to the owner if she likes but when I call and ask to speak to the owner then apparently the owner only speaks Italian and doesn't understand English. Does this make sense to anyone else ? I ordered an eggless cake and obviously it should be a sponge one is it so hard to own up to their mistake of miscommunication on that lady's part that they can't just replace the cake ? Another lady who picks up is saying they don't even do eggless sponge cakes so now I'm just confused. Who's telling the truth and who's lying ? Are they fooling their customers telling them they sell eggless cakes? Are they trying to kill someone who has an egg allergy? Is the Francesca Bakery trying to lose customers? Do they take pride on providing ridiculous customer service? Which owner refuses to talk to their customer and solve the problem in which case both parties are happy? If you need an eggless cake, you're better off going somewhere else as this bakery seems confused and definitely does not own up to its mistakes. Save yourselves! Way to ruin my sister's 20th birthday - hope you're happy!"}
{"text":"Pure love. I got my partner the chocolate cake and it tasted exactly like biting into a Ferraro Rocher! We all enjoyed it very much and best part was it wasn't too sweet. We usually get our favourites here: cannoli, gelato, rice balls/arrachini, pasta of the day and whatever they have that looks good on the hot table. Really like the staff even the ones who greets customers by saying, \"Hi how are you? I'm new here so I don't know how to make anything.\" A + for honesty and I would probably say the same if I were their age. We genuinely love coming here!"}
{"text":"i love the rice balls, esp the cheese ones. veal sammies are good, too. the seafood on friday is almost always delicious...  oh, and the fresh doughnuts and pastries are so good!  the staff is very nice, too."}
{"text":"I got there almost at 6:30 pm,, they gonna be close at7:00, but they were so unpainted and i didn't even had time to visit view all the cakes there, finally I ordered 2 pieces of cakes, but when I paid for it, they only packed one of them and forgot the other one , so"}
{"text":"First time trying this place out, and I definitely won't be returning. Staff were rude, miserable, cranky and seemed to be so bothered. They definitely lacked customer service skills. I even got huffed and puffed at, and had eyes rolled at me!"}
{"text":"A friend took me here for lunch one day...  The food was so delicious!   Veal sandwich was very good and so were the rice balls!!  Great Italian food"}
{"text":"Lovely selections of cakes for every occasion. The girl at the counter was extremely sweet and helpful in helping me select a cake and recommended a perfect cake for the occasion i was going."}
{"text":"Here you will find authentic Italian products from cakes, canolis, cookies, pasta, fresh bread, hot served food, coffee, and teas. There's also a small area sitting area where you can eat. I got a chai tea and a day old loaf sliced bread that cost $2.00 to bring home. The tea wasn't what I expected, I found that it was quite strong and didn't have that chai spiced flavour. Warning that this place can get quite full during the lunch hours."}
{"text":"I noticed this place years ago when I used to live in Toronto. When Lamanna couldn't help me with a cake order because for some crazy reason they do not take cake orders that have to be ready on Friday and Saturday, I quickly left and headed over here. I showed them the picture of what I want and it was no problem at all taking this order from me. The cake was quite tasty but I definitely can't say that it was perfect. It clearly had food coloring which I thought was really weird since I asked for chocolate cake and chocolate frosting and then the coloring was really inconsistent. Some parts of the cake were darker than others. They get an A for effort tho. Not to mention the price was great. My family and I enjoyed their donuts (Nutella and custard). I wasn't planning to get cannolis but the friendly worker named Maria so nicely reminded me a couple of times that 6 pastries would not be taxed so I was like why not? Lol All the morning people are really friendly. Every single one asked me if I needed help while the cake order was getting sorted out. I think I'll definitely be back when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"Their desserts are really good, though a tad bit on the pricey side.  I've tried their rolls royce and I highly recommend it; it's one of the cheaper ones that's worth the money. The single serve cakes were average in taste (I got the tiramisu and cheesecake) but are beautiful in presentation. There's a variety of macaron flavours as well.   As for the hot foods, I tried their rice balls with meat inside. There was only one meat (the rest were cheese) rice ball left on display but the lady who took my order was really nice and took the time to go in the back to check if there were anymore left. Fortunately there were and I got to take them home! First time eating them and I genuinely enjoyed it. They're pretty big, too. I also got one of their lunch combo (number 1), priced $9.99, which comes with a pasta, a side, and drink. The pasta sauce was a little bland, and I was hoping the side of veal would be flavourful too, but it was the same as the pasta.   My second visit was around 4 in the afternoon and I noticed they cleared out their gelato section. It would have been nice if they still had some available, considering they close at 7.   Overall amazing and delicious varieties of deserts, okay hot food, and really nice service. Would come back if I'm near the area and craving for sweets."}
{"text":"Like this bakery, good price, fantastic cakes and drinks. They have lunch, take outs available too!"}
{"text":"Their arancini was good. Had one with a veal sandwich with the mushroom sauce thingy, shared with my sister. The arancini  was so good that I had to buy two more to take home and a box of assorted cookies. Try their biscotti! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Bought a small Sicilia cake for my brother's birthday that was absolutely delicious! It also easily fed our family of five with plenty leftover to savour later.   The gelato here is to die for as well. My personal favourite is the pistachio one! Only $3 for a small cup and they pack it up real nice too.   I also had some mild salami, and though I probably shouldn't have eaten that many slices in a day, I have no regrets whatsoever. So. Freaking. Good. One more thing to love my boyfriend for, for introducing me to such yummy salami.   The service was impeccable too! The worker that helped us honestly made my day with her humour and helpfulness. I'm definitely planning to return for more treats in the future and hopefully for a lunch or few!"}
{"text":"The only authentic Italian bakery near Scarborough Town Centre, it's my favourite go-to when I'm in the area.  Around Easter, there's usually a long line to get all the family sized orders of traditional baked goods, including the bread with the whole egg (shell and all) inside.  I got the hot cross bun, and washed it down with a cup of tea (no coffee for Lent).  On other occasions, I've had their arrancini, as well as cannoli and it's just as good as in Little Italy.    Service is friendly even when it gets busy."}
{"text":"Had the pest chicken Alfredo and beef rice balls with 2 slices of veggie pizza. Came up to about  $18. I love their rice balls! Try it with tomato sauce if you don't like eating your rice balls drum their slice of pizza is like 2 slices of the pizza pizza party side. We ended up saving our other slice for later. Been here several times. Their desserts are awesome so try a gelato or their baked good too after your meal!"}
{"text":"Update to my previous review. It seems this bakery has really gone down in terms of service. Speaking from the last 5 times I've gone The young girls that work there constantly stand and do nothing as clearly customers wait patiently for service. Some barking at each other at who is doing cash who is doing bread etc rather than actually just going to help the customers. The whining in the store is unreal honestly have to go and see it yourself. Zero professionalism. They don't want to do anything and all want to pass off work to another girl.  When they finally service you they look like they're going to cry because they have to actually work.  I am not even kidding. Shame because they actually put out good food but I can't go back waiting 10 minutes for someone to help me with a dessert than wait again for someone to cash me out when I'm the only customer in the store."}
{"text":"In the sea of Timmy (welcome to Scarborough), this place offers excellent and authentic Italian coffee and dessert.  You will be surprised by the variety of desserts offered at the bakery. I have yet tried all of them, but everything I have tried so far are spectacular! From that cannoli filled with freshly whipped cream, to flaky, buttery croissants... Don't be tricked by the sketchy outside, this place is a real gem!   They also offer a huge variety of deli, cheese, hot lunch and sandwich, which I have yet to try."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent here after reading all the reviews (we have passed it many times but never went in). We try to go biweekly. The napoleon square is like no other! One of our favorites! Another reviewer said that their cream brûlée was not sugared top but liquid- it was sugared top but if you leave it out too long it liquified.  Their rice ball was good. Their pizza was amazing! Going to try their sandwiches next they look so good!  Will add more if we find things that are of note."}
{"text":"Love coming into this place and seeing all the diverse arrangements of treats and desserts. I came here to grab a couple macaron packs for my party and they were a hit with everyone! They also come in a range of different flavours so that's always good.  There are only two things I will say though - I wish there was a more convenient location that wasn't stuck in a bad intersection (McCowan & Sheppard) always seems to be so congested there I presume it's cause the Highway is a couple blocks south going towards Scarborough Town Center - like if Francesca relocated to the McCowan and Milner intersection where Cora's was that would be the perfect spot considering there's so much parking!  And the other thing was that some of the macaron shells broke and couldn't hold together so that was kind of a bummer :c"}
{"text":"Delicious & very well priced. Love the gelato!   The cannolis are great, pastrami sandwiches are good. Decent seating and washrooms downstairs."}
{"text":"So disappointing! No customer care! Went to get some treat for my staff and I've get my attention to a \"panettone pudding cake\" very similar to a pastiera (Easter pie) so I asked more about this panettone cake asking who created and if is Italian. The answer was \"it doesn't matter\" it's really good.. Well I was intrigued to buy and I asked to taste first. The answer? We sampled already this morning! I only left the place. I was shocked and speechless. As Italian ashamed. Dot"}
{"text":"Cannoli here are sooooo good. Better than we've had anywhere else, including NJ which is filled with Italian bakeries.   The ricotta filling is not too sweet so it's a great combo with the pastry.   $2 for small, $2.5 for large"}
{"text":"Always delicious arancini, which are deep fried buttery rice balls with meat sauce inside for the uninitiated, really great sweets and cookies, my favorite are the Amaretti almond meringue cookies, plus amazing Panini grilled Italian sandwiches, and Friday of course is fish day, with a small portion of yummy fried calamari and shrimp really hitting the spot. One of the better Hot Table Italian delis around, plus delicious Italian Breads and baked goods of course."}
{"text":"Francesca bakery is right around the corner of Sheppard and McCowan, perfect for busing! The interior is clean with a friendly service. You can find more than just baked goods! If you're hungry, you can definitely find yourself a great Italian style meal. I would definitely recommend the rice ball and the tortellini which isn't too salty or bland! The bakery is divided into four main sections, deli, hot meals and a sitting area with a TV to sit, relax and enjoy a great meal. Walls are decorated with nice photos and washroom is located downstairs. I'm definitely coming back! :)"}
{"text":"Great place to catch up with amazing cup of caffe latte and delicious snack."}
{"text":"A very good Italian bakery which has several Italian dishes, cakes, pastries; good service w/ a smile; also has a great little eatery."}
{"text":"Taste of coffee is awesome here. One of the best cafe in GTA. Pastries and dolci are so good and not pricey ."}
{"text":"Love the food at the hot table. Amazing assortment of baked goods. Incredible gelato!"}
{"text":"Some things are hit or miss. I'd say the cakes in the display are safe. Chickens ball was a bit dry but the beef ball and cheese balls were amazing.   Customer sucks over the phone. Called in several occasions to order cake. The person who picked up the phone did not have any background knowledge of the cakes they carry. Gave me heck a lot of attitude when I asked them to explain the types of cake they have. I had to go out of my way to go in the store to make sure my order was right.   I only order cakes from here if it's conveniently, otherwise I take my business somewhere else that are just as good but much better customer service"}
{"text":"Popped in here for a couple of things today.    I got 4 cream puffs and 4 meat arancini(rice balls).  The rice balls are absolutely delicious.  They're tennis ball sized bites of delicious crispy breadcrumbs, soft rice and tasty meat with peas.  I got tomato sauce on the side and I would go there just for this item alone.  The cream puffs were for the kids, and they said they were lovely too.  Can't really go wrong with choux pastry and fresh whipped cream.  The bakery has lots of other baked goods, fresh bread and the extensive hot food display.  Was looking at the home made lasagne too.  Loads of sandwiches and pizza too.  Would have given 5 stars but parking in this plaza is horrendous.  There are very, very limited spaces, which puts me off returning.  Service wasn't very friendly either but after frequenting Asian places a lot, you can deal with it in exchange for good food!"}
{"text":"Today I ordered and tried the Rice Ball with sauce, a cheese (feta I think) panini, almond croissant and coffee.  The panini, to be honest, I'm guessing it was feta but not really sure because the sandwich was just on top of the case and I just pointed for to try that one :) It was OK. For $5, it's fairly big and loaded with cheese filling. A bit garlicky. Not very hot though and not something I would order again.  Rice ball is mmm mmm good. Rice exterior got a great texture and there's a fair portion of meat filling inside The sauce was extra charge but its definitely a must have. Just won't be the same without it. At only $2.50, I definitely need to come back for more.  Almond croissant was AMAZING! The outside is flaky and crunchy and covered with a generous amount of almond slices and confectionery sugar. Inside is a nice layer of moist and lightly sweetened almond spread? almond honey?? whatever it is, it completes the almond croissant and is probably what makes you anticipate and savour every bite.  The coffee was freshly made but it was rather bland. We got it with steamed milk, sugar and a touch of cinnamon and it was a nice cozy hot drink. Just not much coffee taste to it.  Service is not efficient and could use some improvements though. 2 cashiers/registers is not enough if one is occupied with taking down very specific pre-orders. I waited a long 5 minute in line just to hand them my cash. Pre-order and sales discussions should be done elsewhere. Food might be good but long waits will affect overall experience.  Otherwise, tone of the service was good. It wasn't too busy and the cashier even came over to double checked that our order for croissant and coffee wasn't neglected when she saw us sitting without the items because we were waiting for new coffee to be made.  Rice ball, must have. Sauce for rice ball, must have. Almond croissant, must have.  The veal also looks good and I think next visit I'll try the veal sandwich and their pasta.  Parking is still limited. Have to park across the street."}
{"text":"Little dessert after a home cooked meal today. Cream Puffs ($3.00) and Mini Cheesecakes ($2.00).  Also available fresh bread baked everyday! Fresh cookies, pastries oooh amazing stuff from the Francesca Bakery.  Noticed previous reviewers complained of poor service, but we didn't see any issues today. Super quick, very efficient."}
{"text":"I was too lazy to go to Agincourt Bakery.  So I stopped by Francesa Bakery to pick up some meatballs to go with my spaghetti for dinner.  I got there went in the line and waited.  The lady with glasses served people who were just walking through the door instead of serving us in the line.  I noticed flies in the display/food case. I bought the meat balls that looked like flattened meatballs.  The taste wasn't as good as most other places and too many gristle pieces.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Another one of those Italian Cafes & Bakery that COVERS all their windows up.  Don't they ever think it makes them more suspicious?  Don't they think they will deter walk-in customers?  Good thing I'm a regular to most sketchy spots, I'm from Scarborough and this place is here.  Inside was Breads to the left, Individual & Whole Cakes on the right, Pastries & Cooks to the right, and roughly 5 varieties of Basic Gelato flavours to the right.  No decor to speak of and plenty of ITALIAN women busy doing their thing and having good fun conversations on their own.  Sicilia($3.25) Cake is available in individual format or Whole format.  This Pistachio Bavarois, Orange Pastry Cream with Almond Meringue and Almond Genoise has the consistency of a PISTACHIO Creme Brulee and was not too sweet.  Cappuccino($2.50) went well with the dessert."}
{"text":"3.5!  What happened to their sign? Francesca bakery is still there. It just isn't...obvious. I came to try it today, and couldn't find the big, red sign that's always been there. Weird. Anyhow, upon entering, I got the answer to the question I've been wondering for so many years: how can a bakery be that big? The answer is that although it's called a bakery, it isn't just baked goods. There's a hot table, a coffee station, a gelato station, a deli, and tables for people to eat at.   Had:  Veal cutlet - breaded veal in tomato sauce. I'm not a fan of soggy, breaded things. This was a soggy, breaded thing. Taste-wise, it was alright, but nothing special about it.  Rice - cooked with cream, and cheese, and probably some kind of chicken broth. Also some peas and carrots and stuff. Pretty tasty.  Roasted veggies ($4.50) - for $4.50, I'm expecting a whole lot more veggie than I got. The veggies (zucchini, green beans, broccoli, carrots) were also quite overcooked.  Rice ball ($2.50) - this thing is the size of my fist. It comes in either cheese or meat (we got the meat). It's a giant arancini. When I saw this, I knew I had to buy it. They ask if you want sauce or not. What they don't tell you is that sauce costs an extra $0.50. They also didn't write it on their menu. Be careful of hidden costs here! Yeah. I got it with the sauce (tomato). When I bought it, the arancini was fresh. The filling (ground beef, peas, tomato sauce) was still hot and moist. The rice was lovely and savory and creamy and seasoned. The fried outside was nice and crunchy. Will definitely be back for this.  Empanada ($2.75) - I didn't know empanadas were Italian. This looked like a triangular savory pie, sans pie shell. It was also about the same size as my fist. The empanada was filled with ground beef and onions, and also half a hard boiled egg (or perhaps a full one), and a singular black olive nestled in one of the corners. Taste-wise, also worth the $2.75.   THE GELATO. Sampling is a yes. The pistachio actually tasted like pistachio. This was the first time I've had any pistachio gelato that actually tasted like pistachio! It was delightful. The mango was nice and fruity. The hazelnut tasted like a ferrero rocher. The coffee, while slightly more grainy than the others, packed a hardcore coffee taste. A small gelato costs $3.00, and comes with two flavors. Totally coming back for this one too.  Will be back. Definitely getting more rice balls, more empanadas, and more gelato. Will try their mini pastries...eventually. Dreaming of rice balls!"}
{"text":"Francesca has a great selection of Italian baked goods - pastries, cakes, cookies, breads, etc., dishes for hot lunches such as lasagna and arancini (rice balls), gelato, and a cafe.    We came here to get some of their sugar donuts - they're pretty big, bigger than your average coffe shop's and they're delicious. We also got a chocolate-stuffed powdered donut - overall, it wasn't too sweet which made it super easy to eat quickly.   I also got a sandwich - prosciutto, hot capicollo, house mayo, havarti, lettuce, tomato, salt, pepper, & oregano on calabrese bread ($6). The size is huge which makes it a good value - I needed a bit of help finishing it. I also got it toasted on their panini press but left it for too long before eating it since it was takeout and the bread hardened. If you're going to get it toasted in-store, eat it right away!  We also got two of their arancini - rice balls with ragu and peas. I wish they could put some sort of tomato-based sauce on top of them but they were delicious nonetheless and filling.   Service is friendly and quick and the store has a modern take to it.  The cafe's seating area is also a decent size - about 20-30 people could fit. My family and I really like Francesca and I look forward to coming back to try more of their items."}
{"text":"Had a box of a bunch of different Italian cookies! Almond this and pistachio that... they even have while wheat options. All of then were delicious!!! I specifically like the pistachio topped almond u shape cookies! The cannoli was on point as well! They were so good I went back and got a second larger box after we devoured the first one.   The staff are really nice and friendly. So glad I was close by waiting for friends. If I'm ever back in the area I'll be sure to try their hot table which looked like it's been ransacked of all the goodies. Their menu looks good though and so does the fresh baked bread! Tables are pretty decent, enough to seat 34 ppl!"}
{"text":"My friends and I had a decaff cappuccino which were very good!  Our server was so nice and helpful.  We had a lovely break and we our coffee and sweets......today, It's very disappointing! The cappuccino tasted awful; but I needed my caffeine and tolerated it.  The worst part was the Nutella stuffed donut.  Though it looked good, I think they were serving a few days old donut-- it was inedible!  The sugar donut was not much better-Not at all fresh or tasty.  I'm dreading the taste of the other pastries I bought for my family.  For the price...I'm not returning!"}
{"text":"I have a sweet tooth and this place in on my way to work so it is so hard not to come in here and get something! I love it though, as I am a big fan of Italian sweets.   I like that I can get a coffee and some treat to go, plus I have been here for a full cake as well. The Mango Mousse was very good! The gelato is pretty good to, it nice that they have it here as an option. The bread is so good, I can eat freshly backed bread all by itself! I love the smell and texture.   I recommend this place to anyone and everyone!"}
{"text":"My go to for yummmmmmmmy goodness. I can't even think of where to start. Their cannolis, croissants, rice balls, gelato, Nutella donuts........ Hhhhhmmmm rub my belly. They never fail to make you and your tummy happy!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a really good bakery! They are always very busy on the weekends. I have tried their breads, cakes, gelato & rice balls! Everything they have is always fresh and tastes very good. The staff there are all very friendly too!"}
{"text":"Has a nice seating area and is close to STC.  The fruit-flavoured gelato here is so flavourful. I got the blackberry and mango flavour and they're peanut-free, unlike the nutella!  Also sell really good quality pasta and baked goods. The cannolis aren't bad. Most of their pastries have a cute design and are extremely sweet. I like their chocolate cup and Tiramisu.  Might come back to try their cooked goods if I'm ever in a rush"}
{"text":"Amazing! Staff we're so friendly and helpful without being pushy. The food was delicious and the baked goods were so fresh & light."}
{"text":"All of my birthday cakes have come from this bakery, and there are few bread makers left that can match the owner's skill. 10/10 would recommend for authentic and tasty Italian Goods."}
{"text":"Their hot food items are just ok, but when i come here it is for the cake. My department has a monthly budget of $40 per birthday cake and Francesca's just makes the cut. I highly recommend the Italian sponge cake with fresh fruit which requires a preorder of 3 days' notice.  The fresh fruit is more expensive than a regular filling (such as strawberry and vanilla custard) but it has kiwis, peaches, blueberries, blackberries and strawberries. I like to try and persuade myself that the cake is healthy for this reason. Feel free to adopt my strategy. They have mousse cakes in the freezer which are cheaper than the Italian sponge with mixed fruit and all of the ones i have tried have been great! My favorite one is the Pistachio mousse cake which is Sicilia and there is this white chocolate and raspberry one that comes in at a very close second. Their chocolate mousse cakes are a bit too sweet for me so before you buy a full size cake, buy the minis to try them out first."}
{"text":"Have a spacious private parking lot, located close to Highway 401, spacious dining area, quick service, and most importantly, great food!  I have been here twice, both for dessert and coffee, but I heard good things about their savory items. Love their cannolis, available in two sizes (large and small, with a dollar difference). Their cream puffs are okay but nothing too special about it. They also sell one-day-old pastries in a bag for a cheaper price.   Overall, a solid bakery. It has been there for a while and always busy (good signs). I would recommend this place to anyone near this area for decent desserts and also Italian hot meals for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"I have always passed by Francesca Bakery, but it was never enticing enough for me to walk in.   I was pleasantly surprised when I stepped into the bakery for the first time, as the store front was deceptively all covered up. There was a rack of freshly made bread and pastries. As I walked closer to the long glass display, there were rows of cookies, small cakes, chocolate and macarons, all looking so delicious. There is also a hot food section and meals made to order. A cappuccino machine is just around the corner. There is also a small eating area if you wish to eat in.  In the freezers, there are different cake size selection, starting at $18 for a small. It is definitely something I would want to try, as I'm a sucker for cake.   Definitely WILL be back to try out those yummy cakes."}
{"text":"OK, while I have used the Big Cannoli as my standard, I have to give these guys their just \"desert\". On par in terms of cannoli shells with The Big Cannoli, they too stuff theirs only when sold. You end up with the total \"crunchatation\" of the freshest possible cannoli imaginable. The ricotta filling is the smoothest I have had and their chocolate filling is just ah-mazing!  What sets them apart is their selection of amazing pastries. From Créme Brûlée to Rhum Balls, the flavours are all so fresh. It does not stop there. The hot table looks pretty good too. I would have loved to try a hot veal sandwich but they were sold out of veal when we got there. This is always a good sign. There was also a large selection of various breads.  Definitely a keeper. Worth the drive from Richmond Hill. We are going back Often! Waistline, watch out LOL."}
{"text":"Serving the Scarborough neighborhood for decades! I've passed by this place countless times but have never stepped foot into Francesca's until this past Sunday!   Don't let the outside fool you, though its exterior may look simple, once you're inside its heaven on earth!!!  Well laid out, clean, and friendly like most Italian bakeries, all the delicatessan's displayed can be overwhelming, like you're at a candy store!!!  Everything is made in-house and baked with love!! the prices are reasonable and just pure quality!  Torrone was magnificent...and the quality I found was a TAD bit better than Novellos.....in addition they have an extensive seating area and washroom facilities for its patrons.  I will definitely be coming back Francesca!! Arividerci!!!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't too thrilled about my experience at Francesca despite the long loyalty by customers in Scarborough. My order, a sicilian brioche, cannoli and espresso were just passable and the customer service(grumpy black-haired woman) was weak.   The Sicilian brioche was more a cinnamon flavoured donut than the actual rich bun its meant to be and the cannoli was infused with a ricotta filling that was much more sugary than it was creamy.   While I wouldn't write this off completely, I don't think I'll be coming here in a hurry.  2.5 Stars."}
{"text":"I've never been inside. My husband usually brings me desserts from Francesca. I've had some of their bite size mini cakes, amaretto cookies, and custard danish. My favourite of all the desserts was the mini carrot cake. Moist and delicious. A nice place for some good dessert."}
{"text":"Really liked this place. Bought a variety of pastries, all delicious. Recommend this Italian bakery."}
{"text":"Really good quality cakes and pastries not high in sugar and they use good quality chocolate, but the store closes very early everyday."}
{"text":"Truthfully I'm only at Francesca's for 1. The fresh cannoli's 2. The arincini's.   Beyond that I have not tried anything else but everyone has told me its amazing.   Cannoli's, best in Toronto. No one beats em!   Arincini's mouth watering but quite fattening you can really taste the flavors!   After their Reno, they look more modern and the service is always great!"}
{"text":"I have been visiting this bakery for years. I love coming in to browse for treats!   They have a variety of treats and food items. The prices are decent and everything is affordable. I love this bakery for its selection and price. It became my go to place to pick up a cake because I know they always have cakes available in their freezer. They generally have more in the back to replenish the small refrigerator in the front displaying the different sizes/types of the cakes. I do wish they start adding more variety of cakes because they have been sticking to the same ones for a while and I pretty much had most of them. My favorite is probably the pistachio cake. The flavor isn't too strong and it can be improved with a more intense pistachio flavor. However, at its price, I think it's a great cake.   If you ever crave for Italian sweets, be sure to check out this bakery."}
{"text":"seriously i like their pistachio cake! its so delicious! even my sister who is very picky likes it too."}
{"text":"Francesca Bakery's food is exquisite,i advised for you to try their hot food.Along with their delicious cakes, and their ice cream is out of this world, you should try this incredible food."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place numerous times but never thought to stop here. Finally we were in the neighbourhood and needed a quick bite. Wow! As soon as I opened the door and entered, I knew we were in for a treat! I could smell all the wonderful aromas from the hot table.   We chose the eggplant parmigiana and the arancini. They were delicious.   I salivated over the baked goods (fortunately there was a glass partition that kept my saliva off the food lol). Everything looked delish. Then my DD noticed sfogliatelle on the menu board. I got very excited. Hadn't had that since our trip to Italy. The server told me that sfogliatelle are available on weekends. Now I know what I'll be doing this coming Saturday!"}
{"text":"Sweet little Italian bakery with courteous ladies, awesome ice cream,pastries and lunches!"}
{"text":"This place gets 5 stars for food. The pastries here are about as delicious as it gets! I'm especially a fan of their cannolis and cheese cakes. Decent price and they even have lunch menu which is full of delicious Italian options :) lasagna is great and they serve rice balls too! It's weird that they charge extra for sauce that is suppose to go with the rice ball...  It's a small place but hidden gems often are :)  I give it 4 starts because the service is horrible. The ladies are quite rude most times we visit... And we're here almost weekly.  Go for the food, stay also for the food. Ha-ha  By the way, parking is very limited. It can be a nightmare if you are there during a busy lunch."}
{"text":"Prosecco pear dessert is absolutely delicous.   Rice ball super yummy. Nice and crunchy with lots of cheese and meat which is nicely seasoned.   I was there too late in the day  so the bread selection was limited."}
{"text":"I called their number to ask what time they closed on a Saturday....after maybe 5-6 rings it went to voice mail which said \"All our servers are busy and cannot take your call\"......how's that for an attitude? I hung up the phone and visited this site for store hours and guess what! It's not here either. They not only lost a customer but over the next few months quite a few because news travel fast in Scarborough!"}
{"text":"The best customer service and some of the best Italian food I've had outside of Italy!! Their rice balls are to die for - huge and flavourful. The cannoli's are also divine. Great for catering, I've ordered cakes from them for years. Highly recommend the strawberry shortcake with rum."}
{"text":"Amazing little bakery/hot table shop. Their sweets have always been amazing and their food is delicious and sweet.   On this visit, we rendered an eclair, which my better half (a baker), said was one of the best, if not the best she's ever had.   We also ordered a box of cookies which our family loved.   Haven't tried their hot table yet but will do in the near future."}
{"text":"A friend purchased us a sfoglia cake for our housewarming with fresh fruit. Ever since I order all my cakes for any occasion from Francesca's"}
{"text":"I love this place! The cannolis are the best in toronto and they have a large selection of hot prepared food as well! If you happen to come in on a day that they're serving pulled pork sandwiches then you are in luck!! I highly recommend this place for all your pastry needs."}
{"text":"As I write this, visions of Sicilian cannoli dance in my eyes. It's the perfect treat, whether enjoyed solo or with a warm beverage. But I also need to wax poetic about the masterpiece that is their Toasted Almond Apple Tart, which I purchased for a dinner party at the ridiculously reasonable price of $18.99. A thing of beauty to begin with. Moreover, Just. So. Good. Warmed up with some vanilla ice cream on the side. Cant wait to return to try some of their other delectable offerings."}
{"text":"Pretty Special favor  I just figured out this place and I love it right away!! Definitely I will come back again!!"}
{"text":"Tried a variety of their dessert offerin471gs. Pretty decent but none really stood out. Most disappointing was the creme brule because the top layer was not caramelized sugar but actually a liquid syrup. Most of the desserts I tried were between $3-4 each. The dessert I liked the most was the coconut butter tart. It had a nice caramelized top coating and inside was the sweet liquid center and of course the butter crust tops it off. And best of all their $1.50 each. I picked out a total of 4 different desserts but apparently if you choose 5 different ones they don't charge you the taxes so I went ahead with it. My recommendations out of all the ones I tried is the eclair and the butter tarts. Everything else is just passable at best."}
{"text":"I've tried this place for the very first time today & they have a good selection that isn't too overwhelming for someone that's here the first time. We came to specifically try the cannolis, which did not disappoint. They were $1.99 each for the small ones.   The cannolis were really good. The exterior was crunchy & had a good flavour. The cream on the inside was thick & not too sweet. I feel like this is a dessert you can eat all day & not get tired of it. I'd definitely come back to try their other options.   There is a deli here as well, if you want to grab something savoury to eat before dessert. Like a deli should they mainly have sandwiches."}
{"text":"My sister and I always get our  here. Fresh and soft! Their deserts from cookies & cakes is so good! Best meat rice ball with tomato sauce !"}
{"text":"Really good coffee that is less expensive than neighboring shops.  Especially for lattes and americanos.  The bakery items are also excellent."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to visit this bakery after passing by it every since forever!   Came here on a weekend afternoon, they still had plenty of desserts available. However, their bread options were almost all sold out already - business is booming here! They have a hot table here, but when I came all they had was various arancinis (maybe the pastas are only available on weekdays?).   Ordered their: - Cannoli - really tasty! One of the better cannolis that I've had so far! Ricotta filling and the shell are both very fresh.  - Zeppole w/ ricotta filling - the filling is basically the same as the cannoli filling. The ricotta filling is great as it isn't too heavy and rich.  - Arancini - it was good... not amazing or mind-blowing by any means... but it was dece   After trying their delicious basic Italian desserts, I will definitely be back to try their more \"fancy\" pastries and desserts!   Fyi... The parking lot for this place is a tad small so you may have to wait for a spot depending on how busy they are."}
{"text":"The place is at a somewhat odd intersection but definitely worth going.The riceball was really tasty and cheap. Dessert is not too sweet and a lot of variety. Will recommend to friends and go again soon!"}
{"text":"Good and bakery are Decent and reasonably priced.You can find the taste of Authentic Italian food there."}
{"text":"What an amazing Italian bakery! They have numerous dessert options (cakes, cannolis, cookies, croissants etc.).and hot food items but last week, I really wanted cannolis from here and their arancini balls stuffed with meat.   Their cannolis came in regular and large sizes - of course we wanted the large size and it seems most customers do since one of the staff offered to make large ones for me since there weren't any left in the display case. The cannolis were delicious - crispy shell filled with luscious cream that wasn't too sweet. Even my non-dessert craving husband really enjoyed them!  Their arancini meatballs were also delicious, even though we had them the next day for lunch. It was stuffed generously with rice, meat, some veggies and savoury tomato sauce.   Highly recommend this place and will be back for sure next time we're in the area!!! Can't wait to try their other desserts and hot food items!"}
{"text":"I had a lovely first time experience here yesterday. I actually came here looking for a mini cheesecake for my mom's birthday because she absolutely loves cheesecake, but is on a health kick right now, so I thought a mini cake would be great.   While I was there, I mentioned it was my first time, and that I heard the pistachio cookies were great, and the very sweet employee offered to let me try one. They are amazing! I absolutely loved how soft they were!   The cheesecake was also delicious! the graham cracker base even had a bit of cinnamon flavour which was a nice touch.    I will definitely be returning just for these two items!"}
{"text":"Nothing really outstanding.  I tried the Canolli.  It's sweet, it has a chessy creamy yet thick like the icing on a supermarket carrot cake, but it lacks any subtle or distinct flavor/aroma to make this great.  Tried the pistachio Sicilia and others like as recommended by some of the reviewers, while it does have an apparent pistachio flavor and whatever flavor associated with the said dessert, there isn't any special dimension to them that made it great. It just tasted like pistachio/passion fruit/[insert whatever flavor you've purchased] cream that you could imagine in your head before you put it in your mouth.  The tastes are really standard. If you like your food straightforward and basic and predictable, this would be right up your alley, but if you are looking for subtle, complex flavors and surprises, I got none of that here...and..Everything I tried seems to be on the rather sweet side for desserts, not enough to be sickening sweet, but it's sweet enough that it leaves your mouth feeling sugary 5 minutes later.   Maybe I expect too much at this price point, but when it's ranked in the top 20, I was expecting something that would put your Italian grandma's desserts to shame.."}
{"text":"If I could give it a zero star rating, that's what I would rate them as. Im familiar with this Bakery, for many years now. Their croissants are super flaky and buttery. Their espresso is very very tasty. Been there on occasions and it's always the same: inconsistency in their customer service. Some days more rude than others and other days, when they feel like it, they'll say \"hello\". Wait times are also ridiculous because they are extremely disorganized when they get busy. People cut in line and the servers never do anything about it. My husband paid them a visit earlier today for a sandwich and some pastries and he was being ignored for a while. When they decided to serve him, he was asked \"do you want something?\" Rude. When he got his sandwich, my husband was interested in buying a couple of pastries however, the server didn't even ask him if he wanted anything else and walked away. This is the kind of place where, sure, you can get your delicious meal but you gotta suck it up if they are being rude to you. I think you should take my advice and just take your business elsewhere. Ain't worth it."}
{"text":"So I ordered a cake with them for  baby shower of my sister-in-law. It was a surprise party and I placed the order over the phone. I knew the cake I wanted.. The staff was very kind and answered all my queries very patiently! I send them the pic I wanted for myself and they managed to make a similar style... the cake was vanilla and chocolate with fresh fruits... everyone loved the cake and am definitely going back here! Patient staff... pleasant service...."}
{"text":"My favourite bakery in Scarborough. Tried their pastries and can't say I didn't like any that I've tasted so far. Coworkers ordered me a pistachio cake that I loved. Their cannolis are amazing (a must-have) and their breads are my mother's favourite."}
{"text":"\"When the moon hits your eye that's Amore!!'...  Amore in Italian means love... love to me means food and for food they do it right at Francesca's Bakery!   When one thinks of the Scarborough food scene, most automatically think Asian, South Asian or Caribbean, but this is a gem of an Italian Bakery serving the Scarborough area since 1994.    Serving baked goods such as cakes, breads, sweets, they also have a fantastic hot table with their very popular arancini rice balls.  The rice balls are a size of a tennis ball and comes in two ways....traditional meat filling and a cheese version.  Both are fantastic especially when warm along with the tomato sauce so do yourself a favour and eat in the dining area.  The baked goods are wonderful with their most popular item being the Silician cannolis.  Fried cannoli shells filled with a ricotta cream.  Your really can't go wrong with that combo!  This is a family run bakery that has really become an institution in an area not known for Italian fare.  Much love, much amore for Francesca's!"}
{"text":"This hidden little gem on McCowan and 401 is a great bakery/cafe. They have an amazing tiramisu with the traditional lady fingers. The cake has a hint of Bailey's and is very rich and creamy. There isn't much cocoa powder which is good because that usually makes a huge mess.   The bakery is very busy in the morning. A large tiramisu cake is $36 and is 8\" in diameter. It will easily feed 8 or more people.   I highly recommend trying their other pastries."}
{"text":"Great place away from the busy complexes in the surrounding area. We love the sandwiches, treats and coffee ... especially the price!   It's a little away from where we usually are but if we are in the area or even just driving along Highway 401, we'd definitely make it an option to come here.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ok I will say it. They have the BEST Cannoli in Toronto. Grab the mini or regular size and you won't be disappointed! The ricotta filling is always fresh and the cannoli shell is nice and crispy. Even the next day!  We've order a cake in the past and it was super fresh! The hot table is awesome here. I have yet to come during her lunch rush but there was plenty left for the dinner crowd! The staff is very friendly and will answer any questions you may have. Go in for some lunch/dinner and don't forget the cannoli!"}
{"text":"Secret gem in Scarborough. Great pastry at affordable prices. Stop by to pick some up before heading home."}
{"text":"Decent morning place to grab and go. Good for sitting down too. The foods like italian cafeteria . I ordered arancini which was bland, kebabs, which was ok nothing special. Donuts and cannoli were both delicious. Would come back for pastries."}
{"text":"Recently the owner has decided they are too busy to bake their own baguettes. Once a staple upon which this bakery built its reputation, it is now outsourced and of far lesser quality. A shame, that the bakery believes its success can be sustained by reducing the quality of their product on account of being too busy. They're pastries and catering must really be taking off... That or the profit margins are greater and they don't mind losing a few loyal bread buying customers.  I am now reluctantly looking for a new bakery in the area :-("}
{"text":"They have such a variety of desserts and gelato, if you're ever in Scarborough, this is one of the bakeries to come too! The desserts are light and if you buy a bunch to share, you can taste pretty much all of them!   The Sicilia (Pistachio bavarois) is amazing! But the one that really hits home is the Passione mango mouse. I'm a huge mango lover, and this was one I didn't want to share. The mini cheesecake was on par with any you would get at a restaurant, so kudos to that. Honestly, there wasn't one dessert I didn't like! My recommendation would be to have a group pitch in and get them all so you can try each and every one of them (it is a bit pricey.. all adds up).   Apparently the gelato is awesome. I had a sample of the lemon, and it was mouthwatering.   I haven't had any of their food but it seems to always be busy at this bakery. The only drawback is the price. It is a bit pricey but if you feel like spending and want dessert that looks like art.... go for it!"}
{"text":"Years ago, I worked in Scarborough. On Fridays, I would often come here for lunch with my co-workers.   I absolutely loved the veal sandwich. It had a great tomato sauce. The veal was tender and lightly breaded. The bun was crusty, yet soft inside. It was so good!  I also got a can of San Pellegrino to wash my meal down. Orange and lemon are my favourites. There are tables and chairs there to enjoy your meal and chat.   You can also get desserts and baked goods. There are so many that you need tons of revisits to eat your way through the entire assortment.   I recommend coming here. The parking lot has limited parking. I have managed to snag a spot whenever I am there.   (252)"}
{"text":"I was introduced to this cafe and bakery by an Italian friend years ago. You can find a wide selection of Italian style pastry and dessert. There are also hot kitchen available. Cappuccino is delicious and price is very good. Next time I'll try their gelato."}
{"text":"This place is great! There's a large variety of food here, from cake loaves to pastries to sandwiches to lasagna. I've tried the rice ball, cannoli, lasagna, fruit tart, a few single portion cakes (passionfruit and opera), sugar coated donuts, macarons and apple crumble loaf. Consistent and excellent quality food, I don't think I've been disappointed with anything here. Perhaps the only thing is that the cakes and macarons were a bit too sweet, but otherwise I enjoyed them. Everything I've tried was relatively fresh and the lunch food was hot, so it's a nice place to stop by for a quick bite."}
{"text":"One of my favourite bakeries!  I love how quick the service is here. Not only is it prompt but all of the employees are so sweet and understanding to what your needs are. I usually also stop in to get something if I'm going to a friend or families house and they always tell me what they think would be appropriate to take so thank you for that!  I absolutely love love love the pistachio cookies. I cannot get over how soft they were! The cinnamon swirls were a bit too hard and sweet for my liking. The shortbread is divine! Also try the apple cake, it's always a hit for birthdays in my house!"}
{"text":"Dropped in to grab some of their fresh bread and noticed their rice balls. I couldn't resist and had to try them. I got a cheese rice ball and the beef rice ball. Both were delicious especially with the sauce. TIP: ask for extra sauce. It really brings out the flavour of the rice balls. They will put it in a nice big container for you."}
{"text":"Francesca Bakery has been around for ages, located in a strip plaza on McCowan just south of Sheppard.... I don't even remember how long.   They did some renovating lately so it does has a more modern look from the outside..  If you driveby you won't even notice it is a bakery! OK even if you park your car right in front of the store you still not sure if it is open or what inside! Since all the storefronts are covered up... but when you step inside you will see display cases of yummy, pretty looking pastries..  There are a good selections of different individual serving of cakes which are priced around $3.75.. and they all so cute and pretty...and the one that I ordered taste as good as it looks!   There are a little area with tables on the side that you can eat your cake and drink your coffee.. Freshly made cappuccino($2.50) served in proper glassware goes well with all the sweet!  They accepts Visa, Mastercard and Interac for purchase over $5"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee (I go for the americano) and amazing pastries! Love the tiramisu especially - can't go wrong. Also great arancini - pretty much anything here you'll love. They also have wonderful authentic Italian products - pesto, chili oil, etc."}
{"text":"Love this place. Came here twice on two different occasions for birthday cakes and both of them made perfectly. My favourite one would be the pistachio cake.  I am telling you it is so good you probably might eat the whole damn thing.  The tiramisu was hands down great but I still love the pistachio."}
{"text":"I was looking for a bakery after stopping by Scarborough Town Centre and came across Francesca's on yelp. It was a 2 minute drive from the mall so decided to drop by.  The plaza itself has around 40 or so parking spots and we just happened to be lucky with a spot. Cars were waiting outside for spots so I can imagine it being frustrating if someone decided to drop by alone and there were no spots.   I had a small Cannolo (2$) and a Sicilia cake (around 5$). The Cannolo was delicious! The ricotta cheese filling was not too sweet or overwhelming on the cheese. The pastry wasn't too crunchy and complimented the filling nicely. Being a fan of pistachio, we chose the Sicilia cake and it exceeded my expectations. It had a sponge cake filling with a citrus layer and pistachio nuts hidden within the cake.   The atmosphere was very lively and everyone seemed very friendly; much like a family style restaurant. Everyone was laughing and had good conversation going on.  Will definitely be back to try other choices on the menu!"}
{"text":"Everything is priced reasonably (except for the gelato which I think is slightly overpriced), and the food is generally all good. The staff who work here are super friendly. I normally only come here for pastries and desserts, and they have never disappointed."}
{"text":"We ordered a Tiramisu cake for a Birthday and it was a hit!  The decoration on the cake was elegant and it was very enjoyable. It tasted very fresh and it had the right amount of cream and liquor. Everyone in the party enjoyed it and asked where it was from. We will be sure to try more cakes and pastries from Francesca."}
{"text":"I think Francesca Bakery is quickly becoming one of my favourite places for cakes in the city because of how fabulously they execute classics Italian flavours like pistachio, tiramisu, chocolate and hazelnut and also how they get the perfect mixture of textures within each dessert. And all at a very decent price!  Below are a few more cakes I've tried and what I thought of it.   The Evan Rose ($4.49) is phenomenal. A light hazelnut sponge cake sits ontop of a Breton shortbread and is layered with the most creamy and aromatic hazelnut mousse and raspberry rose jelly. The raspberry jelly was not too sweet nor tart and perfectly balanced out the hazelnut flavour. The roasted hazelnuts on the side just made the cake that more incredible. A must have!  The Tiramisu ($4.49) was also delectable. Velvety, aromatic coffee flavoured mascarpone cream is nestled in the middle of #coffee liquor soaked savoiardi cookies. I loved how the outside of lady fingers were also lightly rolled in fine sugar giving it an ever so slight crunchy texture. I don't think I could ever get enough of this cake.  The Cream Puff ($3.79) had a butter choux pastry which was filled with a light chantilly whipped cream and topped with a sweet halved strawberry. It was good but fairly generic.  The Setteveli ($4.49) has an aromatic and creamy hazelnut praline bavaroise contrasted with a rich 64% dark chocolate mousse all resting on a crispy gianduia (hazelnut chocolate) base and is a perfect cake for chocolate lovers."}
{"text":"I looked for the 6th star but to my dismay.....Francesca serves up one of the provinces finest Cannolis....They are so big on doing the best that they can be, that my Italian peers at the company I work for in Woodbridge past many a stromboli to get to this place....my waist says no, but my heart says yes;;;Cannolis!!!"}
