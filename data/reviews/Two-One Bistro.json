{"text":"Cute little neighbourhood bistro. Love that it's within walking distance. Have only ever gone here for appies and a drink on the patio, but it hasn't disappointed yet. I do find that the staff try a little too hard, but it's nothing too annoying. Prices could be a bit lower, but I understand they've got to pay the bills and staff. It's a nice little place to pop in and meet up with neighbors."}
{"text":"We have been 5 or 6 times and have always left 100% completely satisfied.  Anyone we have recommended have always got back to us with great reviews and thanked us for the tip on the great little restaurant with great fresh food.  I wish I could eat here everyday"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. I had been to this Bistro previously when it had a different name and had walked away pleasantly plump however my experience the other evening was not as filling or fulfilling. It wasn't the food that put me off most however as it was the conversations overheard about the patrons that didn't impress. I would have bought into the fake greeting had i not been privy to the server's true feelings about the less than busy business and the shortcomings of the patrons who bestowed this establishment. Someone needs to be reminded of just who puts those paper bills in your pocket. My suggestion to you is to be cognisant of your surroundings and please revert back to your previous recipe for steak as this version does not compare. Good luck to you in this tight economy as this schmuck will be spending $ at venues more deserving of my hard earned dollar. C'est la vie."}
{"text":"Two-One Bistro is a cute place! Their food is amazing! I had their Turkey Club Wrap and Butternut squash soup. Can't wait till their patio opens."}
{"text":"Welcoming atmosphere....loved the live music. Food was top notch. We started with the Caesar salad and tuna tataki. Caesar salad was nice and garlicky. Loved the dipping sauce that came with the tuna tataki. I had the steak sandwich and it was flavourful and really tender. My wife loved the portobello mushroom burger. I tried my son's apple butter baby back ribs and it was delicious. It was so good that my 6 year old son ate most of the ribs and even the green beans. The dark chocolate soufflé was amazing. Great neighbourhood restaurant. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Thursday evening we went for dinner at this restaurant (our second time). One again we were very disappointed with our meal, the lobster linguine was over cooked and pasty and served warm not hot. One of our party had a creme Brûlée which was burnt around the edges, when I brought this to the servers attention he just shrugged it off and said sorry. This was our last trip to Two One, we will find another place to dine."}
{"text":"Sorely disappointed about this bistro.  The food was mostly OK, but the price didn't match up to the quality / value of the food.  Definitely overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"Two-One Bistro is a hidden gem in Acadia.  One would not expect this level of fine dining in a neighbourhood strip mall.  The unassuming nature of Two-One Bistro makes you think it's a pub when you first walk in.  Although they have a fully stocked bar and great patio they excel in their casual, comforting dining atmosphere.

Chef Rodney works hard to make great dishes that you'd find in an upscale hotel restaurant; he puts his own flair into it and makes them unique.  Rosahlee is great at managing the front of the kitchen to make sure people are happy.  A few of the things I tried:

1)  Gyoza - poblano pepper, avocado aioli and jicama salad.  The gyoza was nice and crispy on the outside, hot and flavorful on the inside.  The sauce was very interesting, it was an avocado based aioli.  The jicama salad was a nice touch to have on the side to counteract the oil and cleanse the palette a bit.

2) Bistro Seafood Crepe - shrimp, smoked salmon, cheese with a nice bechamel sauce on top.  This crepe was cooked to perfection and since I love seafood this was a favourite for me.

3) Rack of Lamb - a perfectly cooked rack of lamb, sliced in two creating a nice presentation.  On the side were mashed potatoes and some veggies.  The sauce of the lamb was excellent and balanced with the meat very well.  The lamb was very tender and easy to cut.  I really enjoyed this.

4) Creme Brulee - for dessert I tried the creme brule and I was glad I left room for it!  The creme brule was served in a shallow dish which was great for getting the perfect balance of the custard and caramel on top with each bite.

Two-One Bistro's menu prices range from, \"let's celebrate and splurge\" to \"I don't want to cook tonight but I don't want to break the bank either\".  The diverse menu coupled with the relaxed, casual dining experience, allows people the flexibility to come back for any occasion!  I know I will.

Tip 1: They have daily specials like, Burger and a Beer Mondays, Date Night Wednesdays and live music on Saturdays!

Tip 2: Have an event, gathering or private function? They have a very cozy private room complete with a TV screen."}
