{"text":"No complaints, excellent quality! I always go for the halibut, it comes with a tasty baby shrimp.   I suggest adding ketchup and gravy to the fries for a heavenly surprise."}
{"text":"I can't seem to make the star go half way because I'd give this little Mom & Pop's spot 3 &1/2 stars. Sun Crisp Fish & Chips has been a staple on Weston Rd. since I was a child. This is the hood known as Mount Dennis. It is as basic as it gets. For me it is very much a reminder of my childhood days as this was the spot my parents, who were Brits, often stopped to get their guff full of home time memories of the \"old country\" as my Father would always refer to Scotland as. Mushy peas and chips and a big piece of halibut fried up crispy golden. I always passed on the mushy peas. I figured I'd have enough years of being in the old folkies home to eat food that was mushy and required no teeth.   At Sun Crisp they have the good sense to change the oil regularly so I have never had a piece of fish where I've tasted oil before I've tasted fish. Over cooked and over used oil is a major faux pas that many fry houses commit. Every time I'm in that neighbourhood and I'm feeling like some lunch and the need to reminisce this is spot I'll pit stop in to. Fish & chips will run you about $10 a portion, heaping with hot, crispy fresh potato fries. Bring on the malt vinegar and I can practically hear my Mother's voice asking if I want some mushy peas.   While this rating really deserves a four star, the shop is in major need of good cleaning out and straightening up. I think they still have the same napkin dispensers that were there when I was a kid. It's a bit grubby and when you feel like you are sliding on your banquette its time to give the place a good going over. Other than that, make it a take out (although no matter what, take away fish & chips are never as good as they are when they are cooked and served to you)."}
{"text":"Literally the best fish and chips in town. Great vibes and huge portions. Cash only but i don't even mind it's devious and fresh as heck"}
{"text":"I have found the only F&C place that is open on Sunday!!! Is this a law or something?  Food:    Always super hot.  I have never got food that has not been at a temperature to burn my mouth.  I almost want them to keep it a few minutes to cool down to save me from temptation [and the subsequent pain].  Large portions, although the my last visit i noticed a few less fries (maybe it was because i ordered the dinner). The dinner comes with coleslaw but costs the same price.  No brainer, considering the coleslaw is good - very crisp and fresh tasting.  Tartar sauce comes in the wings packets (logo looks like a green PC), which is my favorite kind, so i can't complain.  The only thing missing is a lemon wedge.  The fish (Cod) tastes great, not fishy (although i don't mind fishy - i don't like halibut because its not fishy enough).  I have tried the Big Roughy (on sale),and  the haddock, both were good.  The fries are crispy and hot. seem fresh cut (can't remember if the menu says they are or not).  My last visit the oil was so fresh that the fries looked undercooked because they weren't very brown, but were actually cooked more than the fries i got a diner that day before.  Battered shrimps are your standard fare, and come with a standard cocktail sauce.  Gravy is super hot and comes in a big bowl. Not to salty, and not too thick. A steal for .75  Interior: The place probably looks like it did 20 years ago.  Is this an issue? No, i think it adds some character, and it adds to the mom and pop feel of this place.  Yes they probably have the same napkin dispensers as they did when it opened, but by no means is this place grubby.  Maybe chairs have replaced the banquettes (cuz i din't see any)  Would I go back? Of course, mostly on Sundays though.  One odd note:  everything is full service, but you have to pay at the register. Weird."}
{"text":"Cod fish & chips, $8.25 plus taxes.  The fish was fried FRESH. Their chips are home made with a milky potatoey-goody taste. The batter is light-oily-thinly-crispy.  Add salt and pepper to your taste.  New oil !!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome fish&chips place!  Family that you can tell as soon as you set foot in the door!"}
{"text":"Very good.  Lots of fries...so order one fry for every two or three people.  Good value also..$9.85 for a halibut dinner is very good...you cant even buy the fish for that price.  BONUS its only five minutes from home.  Love this place"}
{"text":"Hands down best fish and chips in the city! I won't even bother going anywhere else. The vatter is light and crispy, never heavy and oily. The french fries are thick cut, soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. Yummy is all I have to say!"}
