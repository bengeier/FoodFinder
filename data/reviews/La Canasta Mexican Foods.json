{"text":"I went in for lunch and they were very busy, but I was able to get a table right away. Our server was fast and checked in with us several times. I ordered the steak fajitas and it was excellant. It came with rice and beans and was more than enough food. It was served with a huge flour tortilla shell on the side. It was so big and kind of hard to put all my food into it.  My daughter had the beef tacos and the meat was so good and flavorful!! Overall it was great and not very expensive for the amount of food you get. I will definitely go here again and recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"I went here tonight without reading any reviews.  I was driving to another place for dinner and drove by La Canasta and there were a lot of cars in the lot, and mentally noted where it was.  Got to the other place and it was CLOSED, back to La Canasta.

The salsa in my opinion was a home run. A little chunkier than what you would traditionally think of as salsa but very good none the less.

Had iced tea to drink and the 2 chicken enchilada combination.  The food came very hot, yes food is suppose to be hot!!!!!  The entire meal was very good, and the service was right on par.  My tea was never empty.  The best part is the bill was $11.13 before tax and I was very full, almost too full.

My one constructive criticism is that the food and salsa were a little on the salty side, but not over the top.

Overall a good experience and it felt a lot like my favorite place at home that I have been going to now 24 years!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"So as we landed at the phoenix airport, our yelp suggested this place. Authentic Mexican, awesome service and great food. I had the nanas special and it rocks"}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for about a year now and the food is always satisfying. 

I am giving it a 3 star because every time I have come in, they always say I cannot split the bill. It states on the menu, \"We do not split bills for parties of 5 or more.\" So, I don't see how that applies to me when I come in with just one other person. 

Also, during my last visit I noticed the one of the waiters was sweating and wiping it off with his hands and continued serving people. 

To sum it up, the food is amazing, the service could use work."}
{"text":"Food servings are amazing; prices are amazing; history is amazing; flavors/foods are amazing;"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch with my boss, neither of us had been before and we were both craving mexican. I was a little apprehensive, because it  has a little of the whole in the wall look to it, but I am usually happily surprised with the rougher looking establishments. I order the chicken chimichanga, which I believe is the yes way to judge a mexican restaurant.... it was probably one of the best I have ever had and if you know me, you know I LOVE mexican food. The service was great and there salsa was amazing.  I will definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"It was just okay.
Chips were good, salsa tasted like it came from a jar.
$1 more for shredded beef vs. ground beef. and it was a little bland.
They put your taco right into beans or enchilada sauce so it is soggy and falls apart.
The enchilada was pretty good, a little hard.
Service was OK
VERY LOUD
NO SPLIT CHECKS
5 OR MORE IN YOUR PARTY WILL MAKE YOU PAY A LARGER TIP"}
{"text":"Food is mediocre this service is terrible don't even make me speak about the alcoholic drinks they tasted like a virgin daiquiris"}
{"text":"Best sauce of any Mexican restaurant I've ever been to. I could merely dip a tortilla chip in it, and that alone would be better than most entrees at most Mexican joints in the Valley.

The fajitas and tamales are noteworthy as well."}
{"text":"Great chip bar.  I like the tamales also.  Get there early it is a busy place about noon."}
{"text":"Phoenix is known for great Mexican food and this restaurant is the best of the best! The food is very authentic and the service was great. I love everything, starting with the chips and salsa, the cheese crisp, to my burro enchilada style. 
Great service, great price, and FANTASTIC food. I highly recommend everyone to eat this yummy restaurant."}
{"text":"Haven't been here for years and we happened to go for lunch on 10/1/17, horrible experience first it took someone to sit us 10min. Acknowledge we exist, then about a hand full of people we're eating but about 12 workers, we ask a couple of questions and proceed to order, our meals came beans dry, menudo Luke warm and our drinks few ice cubes and not once did anyone come to refill our drinks even put them towards the ledge to get refilled and ask us about how we doing. Then with it being pretty much empty the owner is talking out loud about a worker to another co-worker which is very unprofessional and laughing about it, I had to literally get up and go almost into the kitchen to ask for my bill. But let me tell you I did t say anything to anyone because I got to see the owner act that way it wouldn't justify anything so I decided to review this place. I will never go there again and the only reason why we went there was that Guadalajara was closed on Monday and Tuesday and they have much better service and lunch specials"}
{"text":"please do not stop here burnt  menudo...... how in the hell do you burn menudo mannnnn! so sad......."}
{"text":"Chips were delicious. Incredibly reasonable prices! Definitely recommend this place for all."}
{"text":"OMG...WOW.  Finally got over here from Carefree. The salsa was flavorful and the Carnitas and the Chimi were great!  My only regret is that I waited this long to find a great Mexican restaurant.
Service was great.  Fried Ice cream was hard and crunchy.
Cant wait until I am back in that area."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food!  We will drive from N. Scottsdale just to eat here!  Lunch time is packed with many Police Officers, they know where to get the good food!  

This is also where Richard of Richard's LaCanasta is located and usually there until lunch time, so even though they closed his store at 19Ave & Dunlap - Richard is alive and well and still has the best LaCanasta!"}
{"text":"Me and My girlfriend like to go to different lil Mexican restaurants to try there Enchiladas and every time we are left with just a mediocre meal but we thought we will give this establishment a try and The Enchiladas were amazing by far the best I have tasted in Phoenix it had all these flavors like I said AMAZING !!! And the rice was phenomenal! The service was alright kinda felt they didn't enjoy there jobs and didn't want to be there but other than that AMAZING!!!!! I Recommend p.s. Don't sweat the location just lock your doors and go inside lol"}
{"text":"First time visit last weekend for take out and the clerk overcharged me for a bean quesadilla.  When I told her about it she asked, \"You want cheese in the quesadilla, right?  That's an additional $2.\"  What a rip off, it was basically one tortilla with some beans and cheese for $8.99.  I KNOW that quesadillas automatically have cheese in it.  She wouldn't give me the difference.  Don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"I've been coming here on and off for years. My most recent visit was last week for lunch.  Physically, the place is falling apart, but I come to eat, not for ambience.  It's always busy for lunch; service was adequate but nothing special.  A few months ago, in the late afternoon, service was non-existent.

The food is ok.  Standard \"for the gringos\" Mexican food.  Nothing special, but nothing to complain about, either.  Except come on - salsa is not a can of tomatoes and a can of green chilis with a few onions chopped up in a blender.

 I'm on a quest to find excellent Sonoran food that I remember from 20-30+ years ago, but I've nearly come to the conclusion that is a hopeless quest - the great cooks have apparently all died."}
{"text":"Best chicken chimi in the Phoenix area I have had in 30 years.  Prices are reasonable and the service was good.  This Mexican restaurant is old but 
clean and has a rustic charm to it."}
{"text":"Whenever I want mexican food I can't help but always think of this place! My favorite place to get chorizo and eggs! The food is great and affordable."}
{"text":"Stop through for breakfast burros and occasionally for lunch. The food is really decent and has always been fresh."}
{"text":"Stopped in here after refusing to wait for Guadalajara and Gallo blancos wait times on a labor day weekend. We tried this place after passing by it twice. What the hell why not. Got inside and the atmosphere was less than desirable, felt like I was at work in a warehouse with shitty ventilation. Chips and salsa arrived, half chips half crumbs, and the salsa appeared to be a bowl of canned stewed tomatos, which in my mind trying to figure out how to dip this chip into this thick salsa that looks like it's just chunks of tomato. So the entrees come and our waitress as serving us spills hot water off one of the plates on my girl, and doesn't come back with any towel or ice, while my girl believes it was accidental, I think waitress did it on purpose because my girl appears to be a snobby bitch all the time. (She can't help it, it's just the way she comes off)  so while enjoying our entrees, yup I said enjoying, it wasn't all bad food was okay except the enchiladas, the tortillas seemed stale like the plate was made 2 days ago and reheated just for me. The ticker was when were watching the game 2 angry roaches came out of no where fussing and arguing about who was gonna win the game, not bugging any one else while they did their debate (ha I said not bugging any one) my girl whose got a serious disgust and fear of roaches fled the restaurant and waited in the car on this 100+  degree that day. Cashier was curious about the situation and took care of us otherwise after explaining what happened. That would be my last time visiting, wondering what the roaches do while they aren't fighting over sports, probably using huge chunks of tomatos to float on in the thick salsa to keep cool while inside."}
{"text":"Would not recommend, for starters they gave us the wrong burrito. Overall the food lacked taste. Cheap food but not worth it when everything was very bland and had no tasty salsas to save the taste."}
{"text":"Small, cozy, old fashioned Mexican restaurant. They have 4 small flat screens tuned into ESPN with the sound off while some old music plays over the sound system. The music was the worst part of my experience. I guess that's a good thing right Whenever music is the only thing that was just \"ok\". I tried the lunch special which was chicken tamale plate with green sauce. IT WAS SOOO GOOOD! I will definitely be back. Soon. Like tomorrow!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Nana's special for breakfast, and green Chile burro for lunch."}
{"text":"Love that I can come on a Saturday morning and pick up some menudo, tamales and tortillas to take home. One of the few places that has red beef tamales. Most places use the pork as default for their red chile tamales. I do take out at this location and eat in at the Capitolito location."}
{"text":"Go about noon on Sunday and there is a mariachi trio.  The Nana's Special for breakfast cannot be beat:  huevos al gusto, ¡ the red Chili ! , potatoes/ refried beans and really good flour tortillas.

My out-of-town visitors always request that I take them back.

Note:  I am from San Antonio and cannot rate more than four stars for any Mexican food in Arizona."}
{"text":"Came from out of town and was craving good Mexican food, saw this place on yelp and had good reviews. Not sure how this place got so many good reviews. The salsa was terrible! A good Mexican restaurant should always start off with good homemade salsa and chips, apparently not this place :/ my ice tea was nasty, and my plate was a bit too salty. This place is not your authentic Mexican food. Service was prompt but that's about it. Should've had a burger instead else where."}
{"text":"Horrible service rude owners & staff they hire anyone at this place all employees look like gang members or can't even speak English place is falling apart has a weird smell soon as you walk in and the food is over priced for little portions they definitely changed the recipes the food just doesn't taste like it use to the burritos hardly have any meat & the meat is tough to chew & no matter what you order everything tastes a little like a dirty dish rag I would not recommend this place it's horrible! ."}
{"text":"We had a half day off in downtown Phoenix and I decided that I would forego all of the close options and mind Mexican.  We have been on the East Coast for about 6 weeks and I need to get my fill. 
Off to Yelp I go and found La Canasta.  Exactly what I am looking for.  A 1.5 mile walk later and I am at the front door.  Uh-oh.  What does that hand-written sign say?  Close at 8:00 PM.  Out comes the phone.  Exactly 8:00 PM.  I enter anyways.  
They ask if I want food to go.  I said I would rather eat in.  No problem.  Grab a seat.  You just need to pay first.  No problem. 
They took me in with no one else in the restaurant.  
I quickly ordered and quickly had my food.  Most of it was too hot (temperature) to eat.  That is a good thing. 
I went simple with a chicken taco and cheese enchilada.  The cook came out after 5 minutes and asked me if it was all good.  He encouraged me to use the salsa in the bottle as it was great.  It was. 
Chips and salsa were super great.  Warm, light chips and 2 great salsas. 
Iced Tea was alright.  Passable.  Not best ever, but good enough. 
Service was great seeing that they let me in after they were shutting down.  This seems to be a family owned place that has been around for awhile.  Definitely worth the 3.0 mile walk in total."}
{"text":"We had the worst dining experience here. We sat for twenty minutes before my daughter went to ask for service. The waiter was apologetic and friendly enough however the food took another forty minutes to arrive. We ended up sending the chorizo back. It was burnt and dry. Looked like it had sat all day. We asked for salsa but she forgot. One and one half hour after arriving we asked for boxes but again she forgot. It wasn't until they came to clean our table that I was able to ask again for boxes. 
Will not go back. Will not advise you to go."}
{"text":"I work close by so go for occasional lunch. Lunch special price is good. The service can be hit or miss depending on your server. Food is good. But this week we were totally ignored by our waiter. My buddy complained to the manager (excuse us for being thirsty and wanting more tea) and got yelled at in return. I'm not making this up. Manager got super defensive and yelled at him. This is now the second friend of mine who has now declared to never return to this La Canasta location. Coincidentally, they are both named \"James\". Maybe La Canasta doesn't like guys named James. This last episode may be it for me too. I'm super easy to please with service personnel, but the manager's response was ridiculous, no way to treat customers."}
{"text":"The food was awesome. Got machaca and egg burrito with rice and beans.  Will come back again when I am out this way."}
{"text":"The food was good.  I would rather eat at Guadalajara's any day."}
{"text":"Took my family to enjoy the authentic Mexican food.  Everyone enjoyed it.  The service was excellent. The food came out piping hot  on hot plates.  The mole and red chili was delicious.   Really enjoyed the strawberry margarita too.   The restaurant is old and could use some fresh paint and repair work on the window blinds the vinyl seats need some work/cleaning up but the old appearance is what makes it more authentic."}
{"text":"I used to stop by this restaurant once a week for breakfast, but as of late, the service is bad and incredibly slow.  It should not take half an hour to get menudo, which is already prepared! Today was the second time that this has happened. That is ridiculous. The employees are there to work, not be playing on their cellphones, which I witnessed as well...especially during the breakfast rush. Additionally, they need to teach their cashiers that they don't handle money and then serve food, without either gloves or washing their hands."}
{"text":"Disappointed. I got the lunch special which is a good amount of food for the price. But the food wasnt worth it. It wasn't hot, barely even warm, the enchilada sauce was too thick, and I think they could try a little harder. I'm back to going to Rositas."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place the best red sauce the food is always fresh and they're hot sauce amazing"}
{"text":"Okay I have being going here off and on for years and for the most part they done pretty decent with 3 1/2 stars with me. This last time was not pleasant I found tortilla chip crumbs on the seat on the floor and  my table it felt and smelled like it was wipe with a bar rag or worse! I was seated right away but was not acknowledge for 10 minutes and the place was not busy. For me I ordered the typical Sonoran lunch which consisted of a Red Burrito rice and beans. So here it goes... the rice and beans were average you can't really mess those up! As for my Red Burrito it was more like train wreck coming out of Tijuana! The red chili tasted too pasty due to the fact they put too much flour in The red chili sauce that's what gives thickness to red chilies and green chilies in a lot of these Mexican restaurants. The thicker the chili sauce means too much flour! I can go on an on about my lunch but I like to be a nice guy on yelp! My Experience this time around was well below average! let's be fair I will come back in about 3 to 6 months after they get the new cook!"}
{"text":"Been eating here for 43 years. Good chips and salsa
And the

Spaniard is my favorite."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a child, the food is amazing. I usually order a beef,cheese, and onion burrito enchilada style. Their salsa and hot sauce is amazing as well. The beef tacos, cheese enchiladas are yummy too! The only downside is that the services is usually slow."}
{"text":"Delicious place for breakfast or lunch! Very hearty and filling. I work in the neighborhood and love having this as an option for any time of day. The simple things are what makes this place great, the house made chips and salsa, the beans, and the rice are all wonderful without even mentioning their delicious main dishes."}
{"text":"I was just complaining to a friend that Mexican restaurants can't cook eggs I commented about the scorching heat that they usually cook on. La Canasta proved me wrong with a light fluffy egg and bacon burro that was thoroughly enjoyed. Thank you for the slow cooked egg, they are so much better for you."}
{"text":"Ate there yesterday for brunch with my father.  I had the Red Menudo and 2 cheese enchiladas.  The food was good as always."}
{"text":"First time here, and have to say I wasn't blown away. Restaurant was messy: with uncleaned tables and chips on the seats and floor. In defense, they were packed and very busy. First batch of chips were very good, served fresh and warm. The refill chips were cold. Salsa was tasty, but not anything better than Pace or El Pato. 
Had Nana's Special: was better than fair. Red sauce was hot and tasty. Rice and beans were very good. My wife had the chicken chimi, and that was very good and not greasy. Overall, was a good lunch and or service was Very Good!!!
We may try the takeout tamales..."}
{"text":"Me and my family have been going here for years. Chips salsa great . I Love the bottle salsa but they do need to clean out these bottles out at night. And make sure their putting in fresh salsa in them in the morning .
And I'm sure they  make  pretty penny to be able to close down at lease one day have all workers ,which I'm sure most of them are family. To come in and give the place a GOOD!!! Cleaning , and invest in some new tables and chairs . and to clean air vents. Plus paint . last time I was in there felt I'll . nauseous food like didnt set well  
I really hope the owners see reviews and do something about their Business . 
Just doesn't seem that they care to much about their Buisness only worry about getting money???"}
{"text":"First, let me say the service at this restaurant is some of the best I have ever come across - prompt seating, prompt drink ordering and delivery to the table, fresh chips and salsa.  Coupled with their great service are some really delicious Mexican food recipes using fresh ingredients.  Try the cheese enchiladas - fresh homemade sauce makes them great.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the carne asada and it was not bad. Food was good. I'll be back for sure when in the area. Hard to find decent Mexican food. This place and Las Glorias are solid choices."}
{"text":"Wow I have been going here for 27 years and ha always loved LA CANASTA but the last few years I have had Sub par meals and couldn't put my finger on what was wrong. .. Well  went back yesterday for lunch and WOW They knocked it out of the park it tasted like I remember back in the 80s and saw Richard ( the owner ) and a lot of the waiters that have been there from the beginning  a lot of hand shaking the service was top notch and the food was off the charts from the Salsa and Hot sauce to The Chicken enchiladas , Beef Flautas and the Pollio Rico just made my day!  Keep up the great work you guys are the Best"}
{"text":"nice food is ok nothing to write home about, just a place to go for lunch, it's close to work and extremely over priced for lunch specials."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food downtown. We went for their lunch specials and were not disappointed. Our waiter was well versed in the menu options and helped me out with what I deemed \"the taco conundrum\" - which basically meant that I wanted the taco/rice/bean lunch combo but with an extra taco. He managed to hook it up with a marginal price increase, a move that was greatly appreciated by both my stomach and my wallet. If you want some traditional Mexican food and you're in downtown Phoenix, this is the spot for you."}
{"text":"Glad we stopped by.  Were already downtown and decided to give this a try. Glad we did. Service was great. Wasn't very busy so we received plenty of attention. I had the carne asada plate. Big enough to fill me up and have some left overs. Rice and beans were delicious. Meat was decent. Overall great experience and will surely return to try your their lunch menu."}
{"text":"This IS the place I've been dreaming about. Stumble upon this place a year ago and have been thinking of the food since. Every time I get to Phoenix, this is the one must stop. Everything is good, but I recommend getting your enchilada Christmas style (both red and green sauce)! 
Great value, great food and great service."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, and yes! You know the famous orgasm scene from When Harry Met Sally? That is me eating a La Canasta Chimichanga. 

I don't know what else there is to tell you people ... other than I am going to gain weight now that I have discovered this place. I don't care. I will be fat for you La Canasta. I just can't quit you!!! I love you!!! Marry me, enchilada sauce."}
{"text":"The food is edible, but the rudeness from Enrique was awful. He began to speak spanish while talking about me to another co worker. When I jumped in the conversation the shock on his face was priceless to know that I understood spanish. Needless to say I will never return to this establishment. I picked up a order with the total of $70.00 plus dollars, had it not been that I was picking up other people food as well I would have requested a refund and stuck them with the large order. Don't be rude you never know if a person will tolerate it.
But I guess when you enjoy being an ass nothing anyone can say or do about it."}
{"text":"This family-run restaurant is a staple of downtown Phoenix. There's nothing fancy about this cantina, so if you're looking for ambiance, keep driving. But, if you want great-tasting authentic Mexican food, then prepare to stop. They serve some of the best dang pancakes in town! Yes, it's true...fluffy with crispy edges. The menudo is also a popular dish (although I have no firsthand knowledge). We look forward to coming here on Sundays for breakfast. And we're not alone because it's often packed Sunday mornings. As a result, service has been slow at times. On our last visit the waiter kept forgetting to refill our drinks or bring our check and then he forgot \"to-go\" boxes. Between the crowds and mariachis strolling the aisle, it's challenging to carry on a conversation. But hey, we come here to eat, not gab."}
{"text":"Everything was very overpriced and the food is mediocre. We ordered a side of guacamole that was about 3/4 cup and they charged us 2.99. The young lady who showed us to our seat was rude."}
{"text":"Got a chimichanga that was just okay. It was edible with a little flavor. Nothing I'd return the restaurant to eat again. 

Got a side of potatoes instead of rice. They were disgusting. Soggy and soaked with vegetable oil."}
{"text":"I have been to La Canasta ALOT in the past years.  BUT I have to say, went today for Mothers Day.  They have not done anything to improve the place as far as looks, food is still decent, but NOT the best around for sure. But when they charged us 6.00 for one beer it was not acceptable!  We each had two beers and that was 24.00!!!!!  Crazy.  I mean these were Coors Light beers, not a fancy imported beer! Did you add 14k gold to it or something????Wow, better rethink that.   I can get a 12 pack for less than 2 beers.  They also have new menu's, with MUCH HIGHER PRICES.  Will not be going back.  Lost a good customer.  This is not a 5 STAR place, it is a dump with decent food. Beware of the much higher prices before you go!!!!  Go to a NICE Mexican restaurant for the ambience if you are gonna pay these high prices.  Sorry La Canasta.  But you are NOT worth it."}
{"text":"I've lived in the valley for 15 plus years and can't believe I hadn't been here before. I hit it up Saturday around noon to find it quite slow. This worried me a bit because most other places (Matt's Big Breakfast for example) are still jumping. However, we were in between crowds. I ordered the green chile & eggs breakfast. It was awesome. I heard a guest ask if they had menudo, and they did. My guest and I, both suffering from mild hangovers, knew that menudo was just what we needed. We split a bowl between us, to which our server brought us a second bowl and extra condiments. (Thanks!!)
I'm spoiled by my Grandmother who makes homemade menudo, so my expectations are kind of high. I was thrilled that La Canasta had their act together and served up an excellent bowl or red menudo. 
I now have a place to bring friends & family for a really good Mexican breakfast. I look forward to checking them out for lunch & dinner entrees too.http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3068/3107975444_4907cb63ae_m.jpg"}
{"text":"I only eat here for breakfast because I work nearby.  They have some of the best breakfast burritos in the Valley.  Steak and Egg or Machaca and Egg are both awesome and I always add guacamole inside to make it even better."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to La Canasta on 7th Ave in 26 years as I had moved.  I was back in town recently and went to La Canasta.  My goodness it was just as good and tasty and wonderful if not even better than when I was last there.  Great place to eat and clean and the pricing was great as well.  Keep up the good work I'll be back.  Thank you Lisa Lopez-Lugo"}
{"text":"Try try try again, 
Had to ask twice for ice tea. Then it tasted like it was yesterday's, you know that funk like the tea pot wasn't cleaned out the night before. 1.99 for watered down gross. 
Fish tacos, 2 for 5.99
I opened them and they were loaded with lettuce and salsa. Oh and cheese was sprinkled in there. Looked for the fish, and oh there are some little tiny chunks mixed in. I taste it and no kidding it was yesterday's salsa because it didn't taste of the salsa on the table, it had that over night onion flavor left over thing going on. yuck. Guess they were going for the big taco look of something??  Wasn't fish!
Maybe one piece of fish diced between the two. I looked! 

All I could think of was that i didn't have time to go else where or I would have got up and left. 

I have to say I expected more based on reviews. I wouldn't go back if someone offered to buy! 

FYI, the bus boy that blew me off, dropped cups because he couldn't quite get enough fingers down the tops of glasses to hold on. Food handlers card? Mmmmmm

My waitress was nice++ once she found me."}
{"text":"I will NEVER eat here again. With a group of 4, we went for lunch. We are sat right away, that's where the good service ended. They only refilled our beverages once, at the very end of the meal and after we all tried making eye contact with every employee to get water. When we placed the order, the server said we could pay separately at the counter. When we got to the counter, the EXTREMELY RUDE cashier was short with us and said he didn't have time and he was too busy to split our checks. I told him we were told we were able to and he didn't care. One of us ended up paying for everyone and will work out the costs later. I have never dealt with such a rude and ill-mannered cashier. Glad to know I can remove an option from my list when I look for places to spend my lunch."}
{"text":"I been eating here all my life ND the food is always on point. I bring my family here that comes in from California for some authentic Spanish food."}
{"text":"This place has great food and service. Really cozy homely environment. Even though they were busy because it's a very popular place, we got seated promptly. I ordered the carne asada burrito, my mom and girlfriend got tacos. Everything was to die for. Great tacos and guacamole too. Come for the food, great service and environment. Lots if big groups were there, so next big event or group outing we'll definitely come to this place, as well as a frequent place for date night. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for so flavorful authentic style Mexican food. Yum!"}
{"text":"Any place that has a huge sign that announces \"no split checks\" gets under my skin before I even sit down. This restaurant is walking distance from Downtown Phoenix, which means a large lunch crowd. If most are like me, I go to lunch with a group and I never have cash. Restaurants that are not willing to split checks usually move to my 'do  not visit again' list. The food is average, I have definitely had better in the area. However the lunch specials are very affordable and for the price, the food is not that bad. The staff was friendly and we received our food fairly quickly. The part that takes longest is paying the bill. Not only will they not split the check, they have one cashier that we all must walk up to and pay. If my arm is twisted, I may return but definitely will not be disappointed if I forget about this lunch spot."}
{"text":"We went here on Sunday for the first time the place was busy so was put name on wait list but was well worth the wait my husband ordered steak picado and I the Botana del Carmen it was a mini sample plate the food was very good and service also can't wait to go back to try the next plate yummy"}
{"text":"This was my number one craving during my pregnancy. I LOVE THE RED BURRO COMBO!!! We've been going here for years and will continue to go. Yeah the location isn't the best but so what. The service is super fast, before you eat half of the chips your food is done. Great prices and wonderful staff!"}
{"text":"Great Service and great food. My family likes the steak picado and the chili releno.

*Suck D.; sorry, you spell it Sukh... Next time you're in there you might want to pay attention to the big red and white sign behind the counter that clearly says they will not separate checks at all regardless of party size."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for lunch, and I have not been disappointed once! I went to the restaurant on a Friday afternoon with a few coworkers, and there were lines forming outside the door. The prices are really unbeatable, and portions are generous. The red tamale plate that I had was quite spicy, but I was able to balance it with the restaurant-made chips. For those who are checking out the restaurant for the first time, there is a self-serve area with corn/flour tortilla chips and salsa. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Carne Asada to go and the plate just tasted like mush. Everything was mixed up, so it just didn't sit well with my stomach. My friend ordered the burrito and she liked it. Next time we will eat inside, maybe that has something to do with the taste. Also my Diet Coke was flat. I wouldn't mind coming back and trying something else."}
{"text":"Most honestly, one of the best Mexican restaurants in Arizona. Actually.. one of the best Mexican restaurants I have ever been to!! The whole meal was delicious, right down to the salsa. In fact, the entire meal was filled with \"mmmm's and ahhhh's!\" 
I was even kind of sad there wasn't one closer to Tempe, until our server informed us that the Burrito Shop on University is owned by the same people. Score!"}
{"text":"It was ok. I ordered the carne asada taco platter. It fell apart. My gf ordered steak fajitas and the meat was very chewy. My boy ordered shrimp fajitas but there was barely any. The service was good but the food didn't have any quality taste. I will not be coming back to this place. It's horrible"}
{"text":"Great recommendation for Mothers Day. They have great food and Mariachis. The only con is it being a holiday they wait can be as long as 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Second time experience bad service. Never going there again. They need to stop hiring kids with no experience."}
{"text":"It's not that bad of a place. I have been here a few times. I do enjoy their chili verde. Today I had the Nana's special. Potatoes, eggs, beans, and chili verde. It was very good. Have I had better food elsewhere? Yes I have. But overall I will continue to eat here if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I was afraid there wouldn't be vegetarian items, as in most Mexican restaurants. Turns out the owner is a creative cook also. He made a surprise veggie hash tacos. No beans  or rice, since they have meat by- products. It was a spicy, flavorful mix of potatoes and veggies, over a buttered corn tortilla, topped with tomatoes, lettuce and cheese. It was so good, the hubs, a meat eater, only wanted to share my food. Plus, the strawberry margaritas were like smoothies. Perfectly mixed. We'll be back soon and hopefully, those veggie hash tacos will be on the menu."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa are sooooo good. The chips are hot fresh,crispy and salsa is fresh I love the hot salsa as well. We usually get the steak picado plate it is so good the meat is tender full of flavor, rice is good, there red enchilada place is also one of my favorites. Soda is good not watered down. The waiters are nice and my order has always been made right. I live in Goodyear and I will make the drive all the way down here just to eat this delicious authentic reasonably priced food. They also have several flat screens if you want to catch a good game and enjoy some good food"}
{"text":"I will never eat here again, the service was poor and there was a piece of cardboard cooked in my chimi. I got my meal for free, but I didn't eat any of it anyway, so what was the point of the comp?"}
{"text":"At some point it becomes academic as you find yourself in a \"Oh, my god, you HAVE GOT TO TRY THIS\" pissing contest with your spouse over who ordered best. 
You want her envious. 
You want her to say those sweet sounding words, \"I should have gotten what you ordered...what was I thinking\" firmly putting you back on top in the who knows best department. At least when it comes to Mexican food.
Sadly however, her meal is equally as good. 
You've got nothing.
Fuck.

The smug little smirk and shrug saying; \"Yeah, well, I tried to tell ya\" will have to wait for another day, another restaurant.

Damn you LaCanasta for being so good."}
{"text":"This is a quaint little Mexican restaurant with authentic food. The wonderful smell hits you as soon as you walk in the front door...fresh beans! You just know at that point it is going to be good.  They were super busy when we went (Sunday morning) but the service was great and they were speedy. The food was tasty. I had the \"Nana's special with red chile pork. It has a slight bite but wasn't too chiliso. Great flavor! They had a 3-pc mariachi band strolling through. There is a semi-enclosed patio for the wait list with misters to keep the patrons cool. If we are ever in Phoenix again, we will return to this place. Breakfast was great, would love to try lunch!"}
{"text":"Solid Mexican in a seedy part of town.  It's a shame that Carolina's is so close otherwise I might drop by here more often."}
{"text":"We went there as a party of 5 for lunch. Extremely crowded and noisy place. They only had a booth available so one person had to pull up a chair and sit on the \"end\" of the booth.

From the time we ordered until the time we received our food it was 30 minutes. One of the orders was completely wrong.

When we went to pay the bill, they could not split the check so they asked us to pull out a \"smart phone\" and divide the bill by 5.

Will not return."}
{"text":"Wow what can I say!  I have going to the 18th ave location for years, but this was my 1st venture to this one, and I am glad we went.  It was lunch, 11:45am and the place was PACKED!  We were seated quickly and orders taken.  The server was friendly and efficient.   The chips were warm and tasty, the salsa was great.  I had a cheese enchilada and a mole-covered tamale and it was incredible... all for about $8.   I was ready to bust I was so full and will go back any time."}
{"text":"La Canasta is authenticity.  Great hometown service.  Seating was fast.  They do it Mexican style plenty of TVs for the football games.  They know Mexicans watch TV when they eat.  I had the fish enchiladas, very tasty enchilada sauce.  The beans...perfect.  This old building just like walking into Nanas house.  Perfect on a Sunday morning!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend was recommended this place from a coworker...I only got a chicken burrito, it was really good! I will definitely come back soon!"}
{"text":"Ate here recently, it was very good solid food and the staff is good too. No complaints."}
{"text":"Good Food At A Reasonable Price.

I haven't visited La Canasta in some time, so I thought today would be a great day ro revisit.  

The food at La Canasta  is consistently good and reasonably priced, especially the lunch specials. Today, I was motivated to write about my dining expeirence because of the great red beef tamale I had for lunch today.  I really enjoy tamales  and I think La Canasta makes great tamales. 

The service at La Canasta is amazing.  Not once did I have to ask for a refill on my soft drink or chips.  The wait staff and servers are very accommodating without being intrusive.

Great food, reasonable prices, and great service.  I need to make La Canasta one of my regular stops."}
{"text":"I ordered enchiladas and the tortillas were really cold. My server nicely offered to bring me another plate and I thought \"perfect\". When I received the second plate however, the food burned my mouth. I did not enjoy my food at all! It looked like they just brought it out of the freezer and put it in the microwave. The location is super sketchy too."}
{"text":"Why would I go out to eat somewhere when I can cook the same food or even better tasting at home?!? It's insanity to see those people sitting out there waiting to be called into a restaurant with extremely dated decor covered by a healthy layer of dust and dirt. Restaurant is super small, dirty with food that comes out of a box (hard shell tacos). Forced ourselves to go as sacrifice to some good friends who would occasionally invite us to this place, where they gathered religiously every Sunday after Church.
After a while, we could not take it any longer!! After one invitation to Rosita's, they finally got to taste what real, fresh, delicious, authentic and affordable Mexican food tastes like. Please, please people; do not settle for this place, you deserve better!
To no surprise, they have changed their Sunday brunch location to something that actually states good, NOW THAT'S A LINE WORTH WAITING FOR. I'd like to think we saved three generations of taste buds. YOU'RE WELCOME :)"}
{"text":"Food was good,  not great.  Service was good too. My boyfriend and I both got margaritas,  they were way too sweet.  Like straight margarita mix with an ounce pour of tequila if that. He had originally wanted a michelada.  They have beer and bloody mary's but said they couldn't do one. Its a cute place with a lot of history,  and very reasonably priced.  I had the fiesta combo which came with a smothered tamale and an enchilada with rice and beans on the side.  Portion was generous,  I took some home.  I really enjoyed the rice and beans.  I would go back for the food but it is definitely not the place to drink."}
{"text":"This is the second time I called one day in advance to make an order to pick the following day at 8am. First time they even didn't have my name nor my order.... so I waited there for 30 minutes. 
Yesterday, I called again to pre order to pick up my order today at 8am (I gave them the benefit of the doubt).... This time they did exactly the same even though I told them what happened to me last time.
Management not present and place is a total mess.
No one is accountable for their actions.
Will never visit this place again. They lost a customer and I will spread the word!!
I even gave them my number for manager to call me and guess what!  They never did...."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite mexican restaurant in the phoenix area. However service was awful during our last 2 visits. We usually don't care at all about decor but the place really needs some effort put into it. Its just looks flat out dirty. Our server hardly acknowledged us. My husband ordered the fajitas, received his plate & then sat there for 15minutes waiting for the tortillas. All 4 of our stomachs were upset after so I'm pretty concerned with how clean they're keeping things. I don't have any desire to go back."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican cuisine and a great tradition.  But no matter how great that is, I can't get pass the cleanliness factor.  Servers with headcolds coughing and hacking on the food as they carry it out to be served -- not cool.  And apparently there is a \"3-second rule\" that applies here if things hit the floor:  worker dropped the ice scoop and it banged across the floor several feet which caught our attention -- and it was immediately picked up, waved in the air to flick dirt/hair off of and then stuck back into the ice to fill a water pitcher that the waiter walked around filling peoples glasses with.  We passed.  Not cool.  No mas."}
{"text":"too many bad experiences at this rest. to count. they always get my order wrong. if its not that they will have someone rude at the counter. they have kids running the rest. skrewing things up. burnt food, terrible customer service. stupid to eat here."}
{"text":"It isn't that often that I take too much time away from my desk to have lunch.  But, I've gone to Canasta near 7th and Grant for over 36 years.  Today, knew I could stop by for some quick take out.  But, I was completely turned off by the short Latino male cashier, with wire-rimmed glasses, who belittled a young black server in front of 4 different customers who were waiting for their take out orders.  As a mother of a young man myself, and former supervisor, I am appalled by the tone and manner in which this older cashier talked to the younger waiter.  It was a poor example of coaching, guiding or setting an example for the younger staff member.  All he did was try to humiliate him... until I walked up to him to interrupt and coach the cashier.  I told him he didn't have to speak to the young man in that manner and if he did something wrong and needed to be corrected, he should not do it in the front of the restaurant for all to hear.  But rather, take him to the side later to coach him (especially not during peak lunch hour).  I mentioned that I knew many members of the Abril family and he said, \"Oh yeah?\" I told him that they would be equally appalled if they too had heard the language and the tone that he used with this young staff member.  In total, I stood there at the cash register for about 3 minutes and he did not apologize to the young man, to me, or any the customers who witnessed his use of poor judgment.  The cashier's only response was: \"Yeah, I have to get better at that.\" I am placing this information on yelp and on Facebook -- and I am going to ask my friends, friends to share this information.  I suspect this rating will not get a good response.  But, my hope is that they will consider providing in-service training to their employees so that this doesn't just happen again to this young male server but so that it doesn't happen again to other employees -- especially in front of a group of customers."}
{"text":"Good decent food. Called 4 different times 
 to put an order in and every time was put on hold for over 5 mins and got hung up every time. I get it they're busy. When I called the 4th time and talked to someone and explained the situation they said were sorry you're going to have to wait. I was like I've been waiting and got hung up every time and they said wait longer and put me on hold. That's very bad customer service if you ask me. I'm very understandable, but having to wait over 20 mins to put a food order to go is ridiculous. To explain the situation to some gentleman and get still get put on hold. La Canasta you just lost a very big families business."}
{"text":"Went to have early breakfast this morning at the restaurant La Canasta only a couple of people there. Not a good experience. It took like 30 minutes to be served when there was only another couple there,  we saw a cockroach on the wall I ordered tamales and they were sour. The men's room per my husband  was extremely disgusting with feces it ruined our breakfast."}
{"text":"Great food. Not fancy inside but you can tell it's been open for 50+ years. This place is family owned. The salsa is delicious!!! The serving size is huge! There was lots of parking and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"Went in to order take out. Service was friendly and fast! Food was fantastic!  Not very many original authentic places like this left in the valley."}
{"text":"I've ordered takeout from La Canasta a few times and have been very happy with the food! I haven't dined in so this review is just for takeout. Even during the lunch rush, the wait isn't unreasonable so La Canasta is a favorite spot for my team at work. Takeout orders are usually ready within 20 minutes of calling.

Out of everything I've tried so far, my favorite is the breakfast burrito (eggs, cheese and machaca beef), and the carne asada burrito. The classic cheese quesadilla is good too. I'm especially impressed with the salsa/hot sauce at La Canasta. It's not TOOOO spicy, but definitely has a kick. They give you two little things of it per burrito which is just enough to smother every bite in spicy goodness. 

I look forward to dining in one day, but until then, I'll keep my to-go orders on a regular schedule!"}
{"text":"Had the shrimp fajitas. Service was great, food portions were abundant and the price was perfect."}
{"text":"Like other reviewers, great chips and salsa and great food!!!"}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week with my work friends. We love it! Especially the chips & salsa :) Food delivery can be reallllly slow at times, but it's worth the wait. Love the friendly staff too."}
{"text":"The salsa and chip serving have gotten smaller so we asked for several refills. The first salsa bottle had something slimy almost look like a nerve that came out. I showed it to the waitress she had no idea what it was so I requested a new bottle. We ordered red chili burritos that were pretty good the serving was a good size."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant three different times.  Sad to say, this place loses out where hospitality is concerned!  I went in after 2pm and was only one of two tables to be served.  I was given a menu by the 'not busy enough hostess' and told to go sit wherever I wanted.  The waiter took 5 minutes to ask for a beverage order.  In ordering the fajita plate, the rice was nearing old and corn tortillas drying out!  Upon paying my check, I informed another wait staff of my experience.  She responded only to tell me that \"the staff gets lazy at the end of their shift\".  Informing her that I too work in hospitality, that this experience was a disappointment.  Reduced tip for the staff."}
{"text":"Excellent service & prices!! Our waiter was very friendly & he didn't let my glass of coffee or our basket of chips go empty- which is always a plus! We ordered a variety of different plates. All of our orders were exceptional but our only complaint was the tortillas. They were a little cold & hard. Other than that, this place was an all around great experience!"}
{"text":"If you have an itchin for some mexican food and are close, this place will do the trick. We usually stop in on a sunday morning for some menudo, ask for extra corn as they usually load up the meat, get there early for breakfast because its not too big and not many places around so it gets busy fast...."}
{"text":"Came in with a Soccer team of 20. Did A great job!  Good food good service. Shady neighborhood but worth it!  Thanks La Canasta!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food doesn't get better than this. The beans are delicious, service is prompt and the hot sauce in the ketchup bottle is what I fantasize about when I wake up on a weekend morning. I usually get the Nana's Special nearly every time we're there for breakfast. Green or red chile, it's all great. It's consistently yummy and warm chips will keep you content until your order is up. Lately I've been ordering the #3 Red Burrito lunch special with rice and beans for $6 and change. The Red chile reminds me of being a little kid at a school fiesta. Mmmm.

The only downside is that we miss Manuel, our favorite waiter, who moved away! He memorized our orders exactly and had the best personality. But the rest of the staff are pretty damn good too though.

When we were married a couple of weeks ago, last minute we decided to change the menu and so we called La Canasta to get a quote for dinner for 80 people. When I say last minute I mean 3 days notice. We got a great price, excellent customer service from Richard, and a ton of compliments from all of our guests. Seriously, when was the last time you heard about people liking wedding food?"}
{"text":"The BEST tortilla chips ever! Thank you so much!! My Nanas Best Tasting All Natural Tortilla Chips are better than 90% of those served in restaurants! And as a Nana? I couldn't be prouder of this woman-owned company!"}
{"text":"This hidden gem had always been a highlight of Phoenix. Their salsa is always incredible with their home made tortillas. Top it off with one of their incredibly filling burritos really makes it one of the best of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Good food for many years! Been going there since i was a kid when my grandmother used to work there making tortillas. My grandparents still have a lot in that neighborhood. I remember chips and salsa being a couple bucks compared to now chips a few bucks and five buck hot sauce. If in need, i stop at a local frys and pick up My nanas Chips and My nanas Hot Sauce same good taste and a couple bucks cheaper. Red chile has been my fav forever the workmans special to be exact. Prices are up but to keep this place alive its well worth it!"}
{"text":"Be cautious here! Kitchen looks like last year's food on vent hood (dried drippings). Cockroach running on counter by cashier and when brought to his attention he didn't seem concerned. I get that we live in a land of roaches but also see why they chose this place. 
Time for another upgrade La Canasta!"}
{"text":"I had lunch there today with my daughters  today!!  I honestly was not impressed at all I've been there several times in the past and today the food just tasted awful and I'm Hispanic and I know how rice should taste and it was mushy...  the enchilada  sauce tasted burnt..."}
{"text":"I get here at least once a month.  The food is above average.  I have to knock it down though because it gets way to warm in that place to eat.  Plus they pack people into the seating area.  It gets annoying sitting across from someone and have the partition next to you moving cause of the animated talker next to you."}
{"text":"After my first visit, I was very impressed by the unique, fresh-from-the-kitchen taste of the breakfast here. It's one of those places where you can taste the love in the food.

For my second visit, I had the chorizo, potato, egg burrito. It was brought to me as a nondescript, large burrito on a plate, with no garnish besides an orange slice. When I bit into it, it was heavenly! The flavor was rich and spicy, without overwhelming heat. There was a ton of chorizo and not a single drop of the heavy red grease that is in a lot of other chorizo. It was fresh, light, and fluffy. The potatoes were perfectly cooked. The cheese was perfectly melted throughout.

My husband had his burrito with chorizo, egg, potato, beans, and bacon. He thanked me for bringing him here ... I think we'll be coming back more often.

I was reminded why I loved this restaurant so much. Definitely five stars for the food and price."}
{"text":"I love this place for the breakfast burritos, but everything is on the menu is delicious. The food is authentic and the red sauce is perfect amounts of spicy. It's a good place for a great lunch with friends or grabbing some quick breakfast on the way to work."}
{"text":"I've been here 4 or 5 times-
my advice
Dine in, do not take out.
placed a phone order yesterday morning for my girlfriend and i around 10:15 a.m, arrive around 10:30, the employee doing take out has no understanding of multi-tasking speed or efficiency, with only 2 people in front of me in line  it was not until 10:40 when i was able to pay, as i payed i noticed 2 carryout containers sitting there, i had a hunch they were mine... sure enough, they were mine. 10:50 i finally receive my food, I had ordered 2 sides of salsa, they neglected to ring me up for them, so the back of the line i went. finally out by 11:00 a.m. the nana's special, and mothers special were cold, icing on the cake, they forgot the tortillas. that experience was a negative 5 star. however I have dined in and had decent service several times.
Dine in. green chili is solid. beans are lardy, and salsa is fresh"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful!  It's been 3 or more years since my family and I ate here. My green chile burrito, rice and beans were FANTASTIC!!  My son loved the carne asada, beans were delicious, rice scrumptious,  salsa and homemade hot sauce mm, mm, mm!!   It won't take three years for me to return."}
{"text":"Most amazing Mexican food... this location and Lydia's on Van Buren!!!!!!!!!! Most authentic an AZ native can recommend"}
{"text":"My family used to come here all the time years ago. I must say, now this place has definitely gone down hill. The quality of the food is not as good as it used to be! I used to enjoy eating here back in the day. I came to La Ca Nasta while I was in town visiting family a few days ago and was disappointed. One thing I can say is service is pretty good. I don't care too much for the new salsa they have now. But I am glad to see they still have the same red salsa they used to have years ago! I ordered the chicken tacos (hard & soft shells), which came with lettuce, cheese, and tomatoes. The tacos were just okay. I should have gotten the chicken enchiladas but oh well. I also had the traditional margarita which was not strong at all. I don't even think there was any liquor in it. Anywho, overall service is decent and food is just okay."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. Actually, the world. Yes, the neighborhood is crazy by some people's accounts, but I guarantee the food makes up for it! The green chile here is awesome. Best breakfast in town, the Nana's Special rules!

We had our wedding catered by La Canasta. The food was awesome and the service was impeccable! Richard is the best!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. I have been going here nonstop since 1986. The food and the people are both authentic. One of my favorites is the Nana's special for breakfast. I really enjoy the green pork chili. The tortillas are fresh and tasty. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. Be sure to ask for the hot sauce in addition to the regular salsa that they bring at the beginning of the meal with the very tasty chips. You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Great food, great time, inexpensive prices. Love coming here. I could go at least once a week."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Mexican food. Pastry like outside of chimichanga,  mild but flavorful rice,  great prices. Wish the chips were served warm,  but otherwise all good!"}
{"text":"Great food and EXCELLENT pricing. I really liked it here. I came for the first time on my lunch break last week. It wasn't that busy as it was only like 11:30am. You order at the front and pay upfront, you sit down and they bring you your food. They are very friendly and the place is pretty big and clean. I had the chicken enchilada combo with rice and beans. I ate the entire plate! I will definitely be coming back here for sure!"}
{"text":"http://foodtube.net/video/mexican-la-canasta-phoenix-az

Great Family recipes made with fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"Food was good, I had the shrimp burrito and a side of fries. The side of fries cost me $3 and I got like 6 fries on a big plate. I didn't get a set of silverware at all so I had to eat with my hands."}
{"text":"I usually go to la Canasta Capitolio but yesterday my friend suggest we should try the other Canasta on 7th Ave. Bad idea, we got there first time ok, we did not know if you order at front it was only to go, if you want to eat there you have to seat. We order at the front and walk to the dinning area and then the manager comes all agited and mad at us because we order to go not to dine in if we really wanted to dine in we will have to pay him $3.00 at the moment, after all that we finally got our food Green Chili Chimichangas. Food taste ok but when we were almost done my friend found a RUBERBAND on her food.YUCK that was the end of it. We had to talk to the Manager again. Honestly if you can avoid that place better."}
{"text":"Very solid Mexican. The fiesta nachos are the go to here. Red and green chile, machaca and beans over fried flour chips. Good times. 

Place is a little aged, but that's part if the charm right? Pretty inexpensive and a good start to a night downtown if you want to save a few bucks."}
{"text":"Just tried a breakfast burrito bacon egg potato and cheese and it was delicious. The salsa that came with it was so good too. I definitely plan to go back with my family. 

Looking forward to trying the albondigas soup. 

Thanks Mike

{"text":"This place is becoming a JOKE they charge for HOT sauce and the breakfast burritos are becoming smaller and smaller."}
{"text":"Listen up follow Mexican food eaters!!!!

If your looking for some really great Mexican food in this valley. This is the place to go, especially for \"Real Ground Beef Enchiladas\". 

The Service:
I would say very good friendly and sociable and always comes to check on ya.

The Food: WOWZERS
The food is amazing. I've been in Arizona for roughly a year or more and this place is hands down the best. I ordered a special that had a tamale and cheese enchilada with rice and beans. I upgraded my cheese enchilada to beef for a $1.00 more which is nothing. Now the tasting, the rice....how do I say this....ohhhh eeem geee....haha. Super amazing by itself, I can probably eat the rice by itself for an entire plate and be simply satisfied. They do start you off with salsa that is chunky and they have one in a ketchup bottle that is super amazing. I have no idea whats in it, but wow its good. Anyways, back to the food. The tamale was ok, but the enchilada was to die for. I had the red sauce and man oh man when I found out it was ground beef....I thought I was in Texas again. I had to slap myself out of it. The enchilada dinner here is by far the best. I think I'll try the fajitas next time around. Can't wait to get back in there.

Thanks guys for having such great food. It's too bad your way out in phoenix or else I'd be a for sure regular in the east valley."}
{"text":"I've lived in the Valley most of my life and I can't believe I've never been here before. The best salsa I've had inn a very long time. The homemade tortillas were perfect. I had a green chile beef burrito.  Very delicious.  The service also excellent. Great people."}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to stop by here the day before Thanksgiving because we weren't too keen on our other options.

The restaurant itself is nothing exciting, but as previously stated by other reviewer's it has been in business for a long time.

I ordered the chimichanga plate which came with beans, rice, guacamole, and sour cream. The food itself was average, but the portions are pretty generous, and you won't go home hungry. The service satisfactory and we never needed to ask for anything."}
{"text":"The best one in the downtown area by far. The food to me is just a little bit better, but if you compare it to the other locations it is missing the chip bar. Friendly service, fast service and close to government offices for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite for authentic and delicious food in the downtown Phx area.  The best green corn tamales -- eat a couple while you are here and buy them frozen by the dozen to enjoy at home.  Everything we've ever tried here was a winner.  When a place has been in business  for over 55 years you know they are doing it right.  

We stopped in today to pick up lunch to go... the place is packed and the pick up line is out the door.  Worth the wait ..."}
{"text":"I used to love this place, don't get me wrong the food is still good but their service completely sucks. Time and time again I have issues with them, until I finally decided to write this review. I don't think I'll be coming back. I have a time restriction so I make sure to call in my order ahead of time. When I get there it's still not ready. Ok... then turns out the order is wrong. We correct it, charge the correct amount and so we wait longer...  ugh then the order was supposed to contain 2 burritos but I only got one. They didn't offer any apologies or even hold accountability. They just said \"you were charged for one. I would have to charge for the addition.\" After messing up the order twice and having to wait an unnecessary wait time. I felt they should have at least offered to pay for their mistake. But whatever I decided to leave and not give them my business again."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service! One of my favorites downtown, probably best chips and salsa in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Good food for a really good price. My coworkers and I went here for lunch this past Friday and really enjoyed it. 

The service was really nice and offered a lot of suggestions, our server was Enriquee, I recommend him. 

The food was pretty good, I got the shrimp burrito and was surprised at how good it actually was. Their lunch specials looked like a good deal, since you get a main course with sides. For q group of five of us it was only $37 so pricewise, it was a good deal."}
{"text":"There are many places in the valley and its surrounding cities to eat Mexican food; however, there is one and only La Canasta.

In the last two years the boyfriend and I have eaten at this restaurant location quite often. For the money, you get exactly what you pay for: a decent meal and generous portions.

The chips and salsa are ever-flowing and the salsa is some of the best I've tasted.

The wait staff are generally pleasant, attentive and very accommodating. Plus they frequently recall what you had during your previous visits. I recommend you try the Machaca dinner or my boyfriend's favorite dish, the number 5 lunch special.

There are multiple locations in the valley, but this one beats them all hands down."}
{"text":"Love stopping here on my lunch breaks. You can order stuff to go and its fast and affordable and the best Mexican food I have ever had! The Tacos are delicious and the cheese crisp is pricey but so worth it!"}
{"text":"This is my first time eating here. The place is great and the staff is welcoming. I had the Mothers breakfast special and I was amazed by the quality. This dish was flavorful and hearty. This is one of the best breakfast to have here."}
{"text":"You've got to try this one out.  Wish it were here in Tucson.  , but we do travel to Phoenix many times during the year.   It's always a treat to search out different restaurants and hope we find some winners along the way.  This one just hit the spot. Love family restaurants that have these enduring recipes that date back years and years.  Mama cooking at the stove feeding several kidlets some ethnic family dishes.  Then maybe one day some tells Mama to open up a restaurant and serve everyone, gringos, Mexicans, other ethnicities some of their best dishes.  I believe this is the place where it formed.  Not sure, but it makes a nice story.  Anyhow, it was tucked away in an area around downtown Phoenix.  On the outskirts.  Not a great neighborhood but that makes it even better.  I ordered the Chicken Chimichanga topped with lots of chunky guacamole, sour cream and cheese on top. On the side came the green Enchillada sauce.  It was the best I ever had.  Big chunks of very soft mild chillies were floating in the sauce.  Husband had the Chili  Relleno.  It was delectable and the batter was light and fluffy. Son had the grilled fish enchiladas which was also so good.  Our very lovely server was Brianna.  Not only was she efficient, she was adorable and had a super sense of humor.  We went about 1:30 PM on Saturday.  The place was packed.  P.S. the chips were great as well and the salsa.  Mild with huge chunks of tomatoes.  Will be back again when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"10 stars !!! The BEST Mexican restaurant in Arizona! The food is soooo good taste like my grandma's cooking! If you want authentic Mexican food this is the place to eat! The menudo flavorful; red enchiladas, flautas shredded beef (or rolled tacos to some), guacamole and ground beef tacos are incredibly delicious! Everyone super friendly and service is very good. Thumbs up all around.  I will tell everyone!"}
{"text":"A family appointment put us in the area and since Comedor was is closed on Tuesday's we drove a bit further to La Canasta.  I haven't been here in years, remembered liking there red Chile, so it was a good choice.  The service was eh, food was OK, and the bathroom was dirty, smelled so poorly,  I don't think I will rush back to visit again.   Last time I visited the  downtown location \"Capitolio\" the atmosphere was much cleaner."}
{"text":"The best hot sauce and chips! I go here one to two times a week! Best Mexican food downtown phx has to offer. Their child relleno is on point. Always very busy so call your take out order in about 20 to 30 min ahead of time during lunch time"}
{"text":"It's a local favorite but not the best local Mexican food. Been coming for years but now being older...the taste of the food is subpar. It's okay but mainly come here because we have for years. Chips and salsa have a certain after taste that some might find different. Nothing really super healthy on the menu but again most people don't come here for that reason. So come and enjoy but don't expect to get blown away."}
{"text":"This is a favorite lunch spot for the downtown employees. The chips and salsa are free, though the chips can be stale at times. The restaurant has a rabid hatred of splitting checks, so I give it 4 stars. The food is decent and reasonable priced. 

I appreciate how they wrap their tamales to keep them fresh. Too many places serve dried out tamales. 

Lunch specials are a good deal. I would give it three stars if it weren't for free chips and salsa and lunch specials."}
{"text":"Have you considered La Canasta for breakfast. Break out of your ham and egg habit and try some of their authentic takes on breakfast like a machaca and egg burrito or the spaniard omelet. You even get chips and salsa to start."}
{"text":"The food here may not be the best or most authentic in the Valley but it is pretty good and fresh and, once you factor in the great prices, an excellent value!  The chips and salsa were fresh and tasted great.  I ordered the Steak Picado and it was really good!  The inside might have been a little run down, but the atmosphere was bright and cheery and the staff, though hurried, were very friendly.  The food came out hot and quick.  I definitely plan on going here again!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Friendly staff! Barq's Red Creme Soda which is hard to find in the valley! I wish they had a location in Mesa! Enchiladas are on point! Salsa is not to spicy for my gringo taste buds. What more could you want?!"}
{"text":"Please do no eat here. The owner of this place treat his employees with disrespect. I came to eat here once and there was a pregnant employee working here she looked like she was 8 months pregnant. The owner was yelling at her. I ask her how far along she was and and she said 8 1/2 almost due. She said she was very tired, but the owner said he would fire her if she stopped working before her due date. How awful!!!! I felt so bad for her. After talking to other employees turns out they are all treated the same, but they are all scare to speak up. I'm sorry but I met a lot of mormon people in my life and the ones i met are sweet and down to earth. This owner claims he is mormon but mormon people don't treat people this way!!! Please do not eat here!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place gets a 5! My wife and I love the My Nana's chips from the grocery store, and after researching, we found that this place is where the recipe came from. Everything here was amazing! It was 10:30am, so of course I had a margarita. They also bring you the My Nana's chips, salsa, and a chili sauce. The chili sauce was so damn good, I bought some on the way out. On Sundays, they also have a trio that wanders around playing Mexican music and creates an awesome atmosphere/experience. They stopped by our table and performed two songs, making me forget I'm a midwestern white boy for a few minutes.

I ordered the taco plate with all rice, no beans. That's my thing that I do. The tacos were perfect from the shells to the beef and melty cheese. The rice was Spanish rice and reminded me of the fried rice you'd get from an Asian restaurant. I loved it! It was very authentic, and now I have a new favorite Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at La Canasta for dinner on Tuesday night, the food was excellent and our waitress Stephanie was fabulous. Stephanie was working the hostess station and waiting on tables all while checking on us regularly. 

I had the carne asada combo, it was flavorful with the most authentic rice and beans I've ever had at a restaurant. My husband had the machaca combo which was equally delicious. 

Great place for Mexican food, I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great place to go for lunch. If you order from the lunch menu, you'll spend less than $7! Normally I get the #3 - red. The service is spotty. During the busy lunch hour, sometimes I've had to ask for more chips 2-3 times before I get some. Sometime we have to wait a long time for the check too. 

The food, though, pretty good. Try the hot salsa with your chips - it's some of the best salsa that I've ever had. They're also open early and it's a good place to swing by for a breakfast burrito or two. 

Parking is not too bad - they have two separate parking lots which fill up during the lunch hour."}
{"text":"probably my favorite breakfast burrito chorizo bean and egg with their hot sauce is da bomb!"}
{"text":"Have been coming here for lunch many years. Always busy but they squeeze you in and get you out quickly.

The chips and salsa are top notch and they keep filling both.

Love the Machaca Chimichanga with the guacamole which has a great crispy outer tortilla and tasty but not spicy inside of generous shredded beef.

The tacos and tamales are also very authentic and good.

I believe this is the original location and family owned.

The service is always top notch and friendly.

Parking has been expanded and easier to find a space.

Will be back m an y more times."}
