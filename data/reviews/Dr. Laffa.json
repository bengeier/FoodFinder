{"text":"If you want authentically Israeli food, this is the place! Very busy but fast and efficient service as well. I had the falafel laffa which was amazing! Real laffa with many toppings to choose from. Also had the shawarma hummus which was delicious. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place recently & am so glad I did. The place was packed so that says a lot for the food. Good prices for huge portions. The hummus & oven baked bread is amazing. The shawarma looked delicious and I'm not usually attracted to that meat. I'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Great hummus, service and very clean. Food is killer. Busy by noon."}
{"text":"People, I have finally found a hummus fule worth going so far north for.  Over and over and over.   I have ordered chicken shawarma take-out (massive sandwich in a laffa), but never actually been to the restaurant.  I finally made it up here with the siblings to take ol' Dad for dinner this past weekend.  It is definitely  off the beaten path as others have already mentioned (and by path, we mean Dufferin, south of Steeles Ave.)  and is packed!  The line was huge!  The decor is perfect for this place and the mix of people and languages makes it a loud, lively and in my opinion, perfect experience.  The staff and clientele yell at each other in Hebrew...English, a bit of French and Arabic.  Perfect.  Luckily, the line thinned out quickly and we were seated after only a few minutes of waiting.  They bring fresh out of the stone oven laffa bread to your table with pickles, corn and cabbage salads and some slaw.    We ordered hummus fule (pronounced fool) and Israeli salad for appetizers along with everything.  Now if you don't know what this hummus is, it comes with hot, semi-mashed fava beans and a roasted egg on top.  Then you take the lemon wedge and drizzle it over.  My favourite thing to do is rip off some laffa, spread on the hummus and beans, get a piece of the egg, top it with a pickle and take a bite.  Unfortunately they were out of shawarma, but we ordered the shnitzel (it comes with two massive pieces, one of which I took for lunch the next day), roasted salmon skewers, and roasted chicken breast (on charcoal).  The french fries are thick and freshly made.  I was so stuffed I was grateful that I wasn't wearing tight pants.  To end it off, you MUST have some warmed baklawa and mint tea.  The perfect finale to a delicious meal."}
{"text":"I have been here many times before and had some great food but I must admit that I was kind of disappointed this time around when I grabbed a Shawarma to go.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad but it wasn't great either and with so many places serving the same food around I am not sure I will be back."}
{"text":"Pretty good chicken shawarma on a pita.  I've had other Israeli shawarmas and this is the best one so far.  I'm not a huge fan of the spices they use but it wasn't as strong as other places.  I took it to go and by the time I had it it was a bit soggy but good thing the bread is thick to soak up the juices.  Very filling, decent price."}
{"text":"I ordered the laffa and chicken shawarma with alba sauce. Hands down the best shawarma I've had in ages, a little pricey, but the food and service was great. Friendly staff. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Place is great! Laffas are made on the spot. Everything is very fresh. The wraps are very big so they are something you could possibly share."}
{"text":"Great place for Israeli and middle eastern food. I wish it was closer to the downtown core though and would offer more seating places - it is almost impossible to get a seat! The location is kinda strange as well, in an industrial park. Having said that, their laffas are amazing! you can't stop eating :) We ate there with a few friends, we got some laffas and salads and we munched away. We each paid about 8$ for a really filling meal, which we couldn't finish. Everything is fresh and super tasty! Please open a location downtown..."}
{"text":"MADE WITH LOVE!!!  First off don't get turned off by the look - this place is amazing. They make the pita from scratch in front of you- Omg so good! Food is amazing and made with lots of luv!"}
{"text":"OK, more of a 4.5 star review than a 5 star but here goes...  I've only had the laffa shawarma here but it's great.  I have a big appetite but there is no way I can finish a whole one - it's a little pricier than your typical shawarma.  Tasty toppings, juicy meat, great sauces (you will want to freshen your breath after though)... however the laffa bread is super.  Great texture to the laffa bread makes a huge difference."}
{"text":"A bit of a dive diner vibe. But I would say a comfortable lunch spot if you are in the area. The laffa bread is a bit doughy, unlike other middle eastern establishments where the bread is fluffy and easy to eat, this reminded me of glue in bread form. The kabab/ laffa wrap was hefty but I found it to be a little on the leafy side. ask for minimal or no lettuce and extra sauce, that might do the trick. The hummus with fried eggplant was great, I recommend ordering two of these and taking one home.   Pleasant, charming, reasonable, but not the best GTA middle eastern I've ever had."}
{"text":"Just picked up the chicken and rice platter.  Got home to only see the rice and chicken, that's it!  Like where are the toppings or some kind of sauce, really plain Jane if you ask me.    Over hyped & over priced"}
{"text":"It's a hype - interesting experience, decent food, but it's just so so.   We order Sabich and Falafel Laffa. Portion is gigantic as everyone else is aware. You won't be hungry for the rest of day. As for the taste, hmm, I still prefer my traditional shawarma from Nasib.  They will also give you free side dishes - but I don't really fancy them."}
{"text":"We've been there about six times previously,and would give them 4 or 5 stars. However, this evening was very disappointing!! The laffa was cold, the falafel balls were cold, the sandwich assembler tried to put in as little of the \"extra\" salad items as possible until we stopped him as he was starting to close the sandwiches. If we ever go back there, we'll make sure to not be \"served\" by the fat jerk who was so generous."}
{"text":"Not as good as it used to be. Portions have gotten smaller, better options have appeared such as Saluf: The hummus place. Very average now. Service mediocre as well."}
{"text":"Stay away!! These guys are thieves!!  Purchased $150 worth of gift cards and they refused to accept it. And then the lovely owner called me cheap. Not surprised they wouldn't take the gift cards - they already have the money. Nothing in it for him to accept it.   Stay far away. The food in the south location is far below the quality of the north location.   STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed we went out of her way to grab this for dinner. Ordered 2 shawarma dinners  at the cash and a felafel plate to go. They were very busy and the girl at the cash was annoyed when we asked a question about the order. I've never seen a shawarma plate that costs $20 and comes with chicken and some cut up vegetables. Very disappointed to come home and see it comes with none of the fixings, no hot sauce, tahini or hummus. Overrated and over priced and not to mention rude service. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Very good tasting. Fast food, diner style place. A bit high on the prices"}
{"text":"Hands down best laffa shawarma in town..their meat Is amazing and always fresh never dry.i haven't tried the Bathurst location but this location is top notch.price is a little steep, however it's a portion for two!"}
{"text":"Pretty amazing food!   I recommend taking out from them as they are usually packed and the service is so-so. They have a stone oven that was imported from Israel and it makes the most amazing laffas. The shwarma is insanely good and they have a million truly authentic middle eastern salads for you to customize your wrap with! You really can't go wrong with any options here but if you are going, try the shwarma and the mid-eastern salads!"}
{"text":"The food there was very good. They made their Laffa on site. We had the falafa laffa. It was big enough for the 2 of us. The staff was very helpful when it came down to putting the topping on our sandwich (it was our first time so...). The place is a bit hard to find, but has plenty of parking. Also, their opening hour is a bit weird (close on Saturday and open only half day on Sunday), so check before you go there. One of the best food in the area!"}
{"text":"Not much left to say expect, I DREAM ABOUT THE FALAFEL LAFFA  the night before. OH MY GOD, there is no better, period.  It's worth the drive from anywhere.  Very friendly and funny staff, food prepared just the way you like it. Gotta Eat Herar"}
{"text":"This place a little hidden gem. We heard about it on \"You've Gotta Eat Here\" and seriously you must. There is something for everyone on the menu. We starred with the bean soup and hummus with ground beef and shawarma. Simply amazing! The warm Laffa bread brought to the table was light airy. The salads were fresh and incredibly tasty. A must ...it's worth true drive."}
{"text":"Fantastic authentic Israeli food. I've been coming here for few years now. Service is fast and the price is very reasonable. Good family atmosphere as well."}
{"text":"Damn. Their Shawarma Sandwich could easily feed a family of 4. It's huge!  The Laffa Bread is delicious. Light, fluffy, and reminiscent of Naan. I could eat that alone all day everyday. However, I was not blown away by the flavour of the contents. Sure they throw a lot of things in there, but really, the heavy curry flavour on the chicken overwhelms everything. Not my fave.  On the other hand, their Sabich Plate is the bomb! It comes with several components including Tabbouleh, Hummus, Baba Ganouj, Boiled Egg, Fried Egg Plant, Latkes, and Tahini Sauce. You basically make your own mini sandwiches using the Laffa Bread as a base, and scoop different items onto it to your liking. Super delicious!  I was lucky to try one of their Jelly Doughnuts, Sufganiyot. It's yeast based, and has an incredibly chewy but soft texture. Thumbs up, I would get this again.  Bottom line? Get the Sabich Plate. It will be worth your while!"}
{"text":"Best Israeli food i've had outside of Israel.  I love this place."}
{"text":"Dr. Laffa serves up one of the best laffa sandwiches in the city! His shawarma is delicious: tender, flavourful and served generously... All wrapped in fresh laffa bread that can't help but illicit memories of my trips abroad in the middle east.   Unfortunately, this doctor's specialty is strictly food. I waited in line for over 25 minutes before being noticed by a server who's ability to smile was questionable. After another 20 minutes I got a table... but had to fetch my own chairs.   Food came slowly and intermittently and neither entree was as-ordered. Place is loud, and fluorescent lighting resembles a fast food joint.   Maybe it was an off day but there weren't too many happy patrons leaving the doctor today.  Diagnosis: I would only return for take out and only before the 6pm rush. I was never a fan of cramped waiting rooms..."}
{"text":"It was a pleasure to watch the making of a laffa today.  From behind the ordering counter I watched as the round dough was transformed ; from a round ball of dough taken from stacks of  silver trays prepared the night before,  the dough was patted back and forth expertly by the bakers hands, then pressed against a round mold to give it it's shape. It was then careful placed into the taboon, a traditional clay oven to cook.   Each laffa takes about 4 minutes to cook and each sandwich is made with a fresh warm toasty piece of laffa.  :)   I ordered a falafel on a laffa (5.99); the bread was thin and nougatty. The sandwich was very filling and glad I had them cut it in half. I couldn't finish it in one go.   Next time I will try some other selections. The chicken shawarma was a pretty popular choice with patrons, also the Sabich (fried eggplant and hard boiled eggs).   Inside it's a full fledged dine in restaurant; the difference is that you order at the counter first and you bring the food to your table. On the menu they have soups, appetizers, sandwiches, and main courses available."}
{"text":"It's located in an interesting/warehouse filled area. Don't let that detract you, it sticks out like a sore thumb in a good way once you find it. I got there just before the dinner rush came. The staff did an amazing job and were friendly and available despite how crazy it was (20+ people in line for seats/takeout).    This was my first time going despite hearing for months amazing reviews from friends. We both got shwarma dinners which TBO is enough for two people quantity wise. A helpful tip is they let you split the side dish so you can get 1/2 rice and 1/2 french fries etc.  It was extremely tasty and while you wait for it, they bring out a few small appetizer salads which were also great.   The laffa was amazing...if anything that's a reason to go there. It lives up to the hype, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food.  Generous portions.... And Kosher of course."}
{"text":"Went to check it out after a family member saw it on \"You Gotta Eat Here\". Unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype.   Menus weren't easily accessible as the restaurant was packed, there wasn't any signage to tell you please wait to be seated or seat yourself. Due to a lack of space and poor seating arrangement it's not ideal for people with young children and strollers. First impression walking in it was chaotic and felt disorganized.   We waited in line to get takeout and it took 25 minutes just to place our order, when it was our turn they ran out of chicken shawarma. Frustrating! Also, it's pricey as we ordered two shawarmas, two bottles of water and one order of fries and it came to $30.  Overall I did not enjoy the experience and thought the food was just ok, whereas my family was very disappointed by the food...but I feel their opinion is more easily sawed by the whole experience."}
{"text":"I frickin love this place! not fancy but food is killer and plentiful too....Damn wanted to keep this a secret"}
{"text":"After hearing all the hype, we finally tried this the other week. We....just don't get it. Portions were small, food was at best 3/10, and it was PRICEY for shawarma. Maybe it was just this location, I believe there is an original location elsewhere that may garner the raves, but this was extremely disappointing. We definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!  Vegetarian/vegan delight! But everyone will love it here, for sure. Difficult to find, because it's in an industrial plaza at Dufferin & Steeles, but truly worth it. Lunch time, expect a line up due to limited seating. Counter/table service. Super-fresh ingredients, these guys take the \"falafel\" to a whole new level. Get the sibeh sandwich on fresh Laffa bread...My wife and I shared it and were both stuffed. They'll add every kind of salad they make to it (plus a hard-boiled egg, if you want it) so ask for the works. It's vegan, if you get it without the egg. Did I mention it's only $6??!  Laffa is similar to Indian Naan bread, in that it's made fresh to order in a cylindrical oven.  Haven't tried the shakshuka yet, but plan to next time around. Don't forget to try the awesome cookies (kept near the back, in 12pack containers). Beware: use the washroom at your own risk :( They're closed Saturdays, which is a bummer, but open until 7 (I think??) every other night. You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"In my opinion the best Kosher Restaurants in T.O.!!!  The service is amazing and the food is just fantastic!!!  i have tried everything on the menu and i got to say one thing Delicious!  Highly recommended to everyone who is in the area or do a take out if you driving by."}
{"text":"This place used to be pretty good. Over rated but a decent falafel. The last couple of times I went, the falafel was stale and not flavourful. The toppings were tasteless, and the hot sauce anemic. The only selling point is the great laffa bread, and very attractive cashier."}
{"text":"I have not been recently but a few times in the last few months. I do live nearby. Had the falafel laffa and chicken shawarma laffa. Unlike most kosher places I have been to, the food in this shop is wonderful and full of flavour. It knocks down most halal places in the quality department. Much better choice of toppings! Corn? Carrot? Yes, sir! The food here is so delicious that after one bite, you dtart hearing Barbra Streisand sing Jerusalem of Gold! That's how good it is. I will definitely.... goy back!!!"}
{"text":"Food tastes so authentic just like on Israel amazing pita (which is homemade) falafel and shawarma are superb i will Deffinetly be eating her again. I recommend this to everyone"}
{"text":"Okay, went back for another try with my friend Tanya.  We were going to go down to King Felafel but decided to pop in.  There was a little less of a crowd this time and service was pretty quick.  I have to say that both times I was here I LOVED the Laffa bread.  Could use a little more meat (but maybe that is just ho made ours) and the variety of add ons is more than anyone could need. It was a tasty treat and as long as I am not standing for 30 minutes I will gladly go back for another."}
{"text":"We really wanted to try Dr Laffa after seeing it on You Gotta Eat here. I'm not sure if our poor experience is based on the day we went (weekday evening) but we had a poor experience.   On first impression, the restaurant isn't exactly the cleanest, but in trying not to judge a book by its cover we still ordered. Of the 3 staff that we dealt with two were smug and rude but one man who packaged our order was very nice and made up for the other two's rudeness.  The Laffa wrap on the show comes with fries added into it, this is emphasized as being the unique part of having a wrap at this restaurant. My husband was looking forward to this aspect and once our laffas were being assembled I asked about the fries. We were rudely advised by the owner (or who seems to be the boss) there were no more.   We were a little disappointed but it was totally understandable if they had run out or whatever the circumstance were for saying no.   As we were having our Laffas assembled and waiting for our hummus order (hummus wasn't flavourful at all, the worst I've had) another ordering Customer who seemed to be a regular also had a Laffa and started to have his assembled. Once he was told no fries he reacted and owner looked over to see who it was said \"no problem! We will make for you\". Didn't offer us any as we're still standing there, or even a substitute for what should've been included.  Basically made us feel like our business was not important to them at all.   Not the best first impression to make on new customers.... we definitely won't be back. There is no shortage of good shawarma places in this city to keep going to this one and be treated this way."}
{"text":"First time visitor, and won't be the last time.  This place is authentic as can be, a good portion of those walking in were wearing kippahs.  I've had many a shawarma in my day, but nothing like this.  What I ended up with was a roll so huge, a lady asked me if I was going to eat the whole thing.  Flavours, textures, and a great wrap to boot... I was in Laffa heaven.  I was trying to thank him, and my mouth was so full, all I could do was give him the A-OK and thumbs up signs.  He laughed and patted me on the shoulder.  I'll be back, Doctor!"}
{"text":"Let's be serious, you will find the best shwarma in Israel but anything close to that would be here! Not to mention the fresh made laffa.  Highly recommended! If you can't eat alot 1 laffa is good to share :)"}
{"text":"Tried this place because it had a 4 star rating and was nearby. We were excited to try a new shawarma place but ended up sooooo disappointed!! Almost $50 total and all we got was white rice and chicken, two tiny things of tahini, oil, and two naan (see photo). My boyfriend had ordered 2 chicken shawarma platters and was asked one question - if he wanted rice or fries. No other questions were asked and it was prepared out of sight so he couldn't see what was going into the container. When he got home and we opened it, we were shocked. I've never see a shawarma platter with nothing but chicken and rice before. I called the restaurant to inquire about what happened and was met with a very rude response that we had the choice of \"1 side\" and that we could have gotten half rice and half salad. But that was never offered and I thought salad was a staple of a shawarma platter (its even in the menu photo!)? And where are all the other toppings like hummus, taboule, pickled turnips, cucumber, tomato, etc?? The chicken tasted quite good and the naan too but I will not order from here again. There are many other much better shawarma restaurants worth the extra distance and cost half the price."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The laffa bread is baked fresh and the shwarma is huge and delicious. Enough for two people, really. Definitely highly authentic. I would highly recommend giving this gem a try."}
{"text":"Wow.  I will personally invest in this place if they open a location downtown.  It's that good.    I could barely finish half a shawarma laffa sandwich ($9.99).  The laffa is so fluffy and chewy.  The veggies were just piled onto the laffa (I asked for everything) and it was the most massive wrap I've ever seen.  The variety was just amazing.  Grilled eggplant, pickles, corn,...  Check out my photo of the toppings!    I don't give 5 stars often but this one is well-deserved.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing.  The laffa is big so you can split it with another person but everyone in my family likes getting their own so they can get their own toppings.  The price is reasonable.  I highly recommend it and I have gone many times and will continue to go and go again"}
{"text":"No, seriously, where did my review and photos go?  Pretty sure I didn't dream that I wrote a review and posted photos only to disappear?  Very strange indeed.    I like the sabich plate.  Love the laffas.    The shawarmas are enormous."}
{"text":"If you love being verbally accosted while ordering gigantic portions of fantastic Middle-Eastern food then this is the place for you!   5 stars, no questions asked."}
{"text":"Love the food here! Yes, they can be a bit rude and it does get crowded over there, but the laffas (large pita sandwiches) are amazing and so delicious!  I usually get the chicken skewer in a laffa with all the different israeli salads... mmmm .... so good and very filling!"}
{"text":"It pains me to give Dr. Laffa such a low rating but I have to be honest that this place has fallen in quality over the years. What pains me more is that the quality has dropped enough that I won't likely bother ever returning again, and this is after years of my patronage!  The true highlight here is their Laffa bread. I don't know what kind of black magic they perform in the back but their Laffa is GREAT! I have tried to experiment with making my own and while I've learned to make good Laffa, it's not the same.  The sad reality is that's where the greatness ends now at Dr. Laffa. Just about everything else here ranges from mediocre to bad. Their shawarma meat, which should be a highlight point is shockingly tasteless compared to just about any other place I've been to in Toronto. Their Hummus is ok but again, I've had better and this place SHOULD be making a point of serving up the best Hummus they can possibly make! If only out of pride! :P  Lastly, they have become so famous within the local community that they have gained the power to raise their prices to a point that absolutely kills and justification I can muster to bother returning.   I'm sorry Dr. Laffa, you are a shadow of your former self."}
{"text":"I wanted to try Dr .Laffa after it was featured on \"You Gotta Eat Here.\" At the same time, its proximity to my home scared me. Would I get addicted to laffa?   Turns out laffa is very chewy which I didn't necessarily mind. It was pretty delicious--but why did I have to pay extra for additional laffa?  We also ordered the (gigantic) shwarma and the falafel plate with hummus. The shwarma just had way too many different flavors going on that didn't really suit my palette. The falafel on the other hand was really good. And of course-the hummus. Very fresh.   The wait staff is nice, but the atmosphere is just way too rowdy and chaotic. I suggest taking it to go."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch.  Ordered the shawarma laffa.  It was spectacular.  When he is naming off the ingredients I want in the wrap he says you want fries in there too.  Yes is always the answer!  Was pure bliss!  Stop in hungry, leave happy!  Service 10/10 Ambience 8/10 but a kosher 8! Experience 9.5  Eat til you feel the heat!  Enjoy"}
{"text":"Another triumph!  I came here for lunch, after checking out their other location on Bathurst.  This location has seating, which is great, and table service. If you get there after 12:05pm, you will be hard pressed to find a seat, though, so arrive early!  The food is just as great as the Bathurst location, but their laffa is a bit crisper. I don't know what it's supposed to be like, but I like the chewier one. The schnitzel laffa is superb.   Service is friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable. Parking is also WAY easier than the Bathurst location. This spot is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"The last I visited here was a few months ago and I haven't been back since. I ordered my usual to eat in the restaurant. I had a cup of coffee from Timmies with me - I wasn't even drinking it there. After I paid, they told me I could not eat there because of my coffee. Not because it was \"outside food\" but due to religious reasons. Needless to say, I will NOT be coming back here or recommending Dr Laffa any more due to the hostility and the manner in which we were asked to leave. Friendly advice, just put up a sign so customers don't bring any outside food in (whether or not they're consuming it in your establishment) and advise them BEFORE they pay you. Not after you take their money so that they can take their business elsewhere."}
{"text":"The ingredients and food tastes fine/good, but the wraps are just too big and too messy. Dine Safe flags them with multiple yellow (conditional) passes over the years and multiple times in Sept. 2016."}
{"text":"This is hand down the best shawarma joint in the city! I came on a weeknight around 6pm and there was a short wait but definitely worth it. The guys behind the counter are great and they really fill up the wraps to the brim.   Chicken shawarma - juicy chicken with excellent seasoning and flavour. The mango sauce was unexpected but a great complement.   Portions are huge and the service is quick and friendly. You definitely get your bang for your buck here. Just beware of smelling like your food, that'll take some time to air out but will leave you craving for more."}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma was tender, flavourful but way too salty. You probably wouldn't notice how salty it is if you order in a Laffa. Bubaganoush was good but I prefer a smoker taste. Tabouli was good but I prefer it to have more parsley. Great meal but overall too much salt."}
{"text":"The falafel laffa makes me think being a vegetarian is a total OKAY.  The salad you can put in are all amazingly seasoned and fresh.  The laffa has the perfect balance of chewiness and softness. The falafel is the best thing that has happened to chickpeas.  Portion is so big that my boyfriend and i halved it and still left very satisfied. The service is very good as well, the owner (?) seems to know everyone else's order as they are probably regulars.  one star off for it being a tad overly salty."}
{"text":"Update: Yelp is saying that this place moved. I have have heard that the original location on Magnetic Drive is still there. Apparently they are renovating a new place at Bathurst and Lawrence and there is a third location by Yonge and Steeles.  I had heard for a long time that Dr. Laffa served amazing food. Only one small problem. The restaurant is quite far north and I rarely leave the core of the city.   Well today I finally got up there and it was totally worth every minute of the trip up there. They serve some incredibly tasty food for not a lot of money.  If you are not familiar, Dr. Laffa serves Israeli - Iraqi fusion. I had never had really good felafel outside of Jerusalem or Paris until today. It still might not be equal to what I ate in those cities, but Dr. Laffa easily has the best felafel I have ever eaten in Toronto.   The humus was gorgeous along and had it served with delicious mushrooms and onions.   The shawarma is tasty and the chicken on the skewer might have been the best dish of the night.  When we arrived they had had a busy day and ran out of pita. We thought this was a little strange. But then they served us their specialty laffa bread and oh my goodness. Any place that makes fresh bread is doing something special, but this laffa bread was phenomenal. I suggest paying the dollar and having it served with sesame seeds.  We ordered a roasted eggplant. It wasn't my favourite dish but my father loved it.  The people next to us were going on about a dish that had eggs in a tomato sauce so we tried that too. Again, not my favouite, but clearly others are hooked.   At the end of the meal something happened that I have never seen. Many times i have asked a server if something on the menu is exceptional and worth getting. They always find a way to tell you that you need to order whatever it is.  We were full after a huge meal and I asked the server if the baklava, the only dessert on the menu, was really something special. She said it was good and that people like it, but that being from Israel, the baklava in house does not measure up to what she grew up with. This could have reduced the tip she would received as we would be ordering one less thing. But her honesty was incredibly refreshing.    Dr. Laffa's is now one of my favourites."}
{"text":"The place might not look like the greatest but what it lacks in decor more than makes up for in delicious food. The shawarma was delicious, even when it was almost closing time. The portions are huge and unless you are very hungry, you can easily split one order between to people."}
{"text":"Came in on a quiet afternoon after seeing this place on \"You Gotta Eat Here\".  The bf and I got the chicken shwarma laffa, the meat hummus, and the kebab wrap. Everything was sooo delish! The laffa bread was very yummy and the toppings & fixings  in the sandwich were very tasty. The hummus was very fresh and just delish. Though I must say, the lady at the counter wasn't friendly and did not care to offer a \"Hi\" or any sort of greeting when we walked in. But whatever I don't take these things personally, maybe she was having a bad day.  Didn't let that ruin my delicious food experience! Can't wait to return for the food."}
{"text":"I didn't think that you could earn a PhD in Laffa bread making. And even if you did, how useful would this degree even be? After taking a bite of the magical and fluffy chewiness that is Laffa bread from Dr. Laffa, you'll quickly realize that 1. You can 2. Very useful.  After biting into my kebab (ground beef and lamb) shawarma with laffa bread, I was blown away by how good the bread is. One bite and all my pent-up spreadsheet frustrations disappeared. Yeah, PhD in Laffa making? Definitely useful. Also very impressed by the high quality complimentary sides and dips, ranging from to herbed carrots, skhug (bright green hot sauce), amba (bright yellow and curry-esque), to tahini.   Reasons for the missing star:  - Not a lot of variety in terms of toppings for the shawarma. I.e. I like having a rainbow of colours in my shawarma- purples from the red cabbage, pink from pickled radish. This wrap was just 50 shades of green (a lot of lettuce and pickles)  - Not cheap for a shwarama at $10.99  To summarize, a highly recommended spot for lunch- this doctor will definitely cure your office blues."}
{"text":"Really love this place and it's kosher to boot which doesn't really mean anything except that as a bad Jew I feel good - but then it is also closed on Saturday - bummer. I always go for the Kefta kebob because it has a great flavour and is more interesting that the standard shwarma. Wear your tracksuit pants because you're going to need lots of room after stuffing a laffa sandwich into your face. The hot sauce seems house made and is very good (kind of like a salsa). Honorable mentions must also go the hummus (rich and delicious), the chicken schnitzel (blows away factory produced garbage most places serve) and the French fries (good if you like them on the well done size). Come hungry because the curse of the Laffa is that they are only good for 60 seconds after they arrive at your table so takeout is a no no."}
{"text":"BEST EVER!! So delicious! The fresh made to order laffas at Dr.Laffa on Bathurst are just the best I have ever had! So much flavor, so fresh and just HUGE! I could only eat half and shared with my boyfriend. You MUST try it. You will LOVE it!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant does not look like much on the outside, and is sort of out of the way to go to,  but has great ambiance on the inside of the restaurant.   definitely a great place to eat. The inside is very nice. Beautiful murals on the wall, friendly waitstaff.  The restaurant is usually crowded no matter what time you go there, lots of people eating there. There is also a section for take-away too.    The laffa was so good. It was served nice and warm, and very tasty. I had the shwarma plate with fries, and I could not finish it, the portions are very generous. The prices are not expensive either.  The waitress also gives you various toppings to go with your food (hummus, etc) .  I definitely would like to go back to this restaurant again.."}
{"text":"Pros: Good, authentic laffa. The service was great, but I spoke their language, that may have been why.   Cons: They frequently run out of sharwma meat later in the day.  The implications for my dinner that night: no shwarma in a laffa- the very reason we traipsed up there. Oh well. I will try again at a different time.   Often oil is added to everything at the Mediterranean places, but they seemed to have actually steamed the vegetables for my veggie side dish without excess oil dripping everywhere."}
{"text":"This is the best middle eastern or Israeli restaurant in town. However, the place can be a zoo with long lines and can be pricey. The laffa is the best and the oven was brought in from Jerusalem so its authentic.  Due to the place being so busy they can skimp on portions and its disappointing to wonder where my chicken has disappeared too."}
{"text":"Dr. laffa is sort of an institute already for people living or working in the area. the food is always fresh, the laffa (flat bread) they have is just too good to pass on. If you order the shawarma in a laffa you may need to have a little nap cause it's a giant sandwich. All in all, great food, good service. very crowded for lunch but worth the trip and the visit."}
{"text":"I have been there twice, once at lunch on a Friday and once at dinner on a weekday. It was really slammed both times.  The Friday lunch features a special soup which is a sweetish beet soup with meat filled dumplings. It has an interesting and delicious taste. We also had 2 laffa sandwiches, one with only vegetables and one with meat. The vegetable sandwich was terrific, a really delicious blend of fried eggplants, eggs, pickles, humus, tahina and much more.....The meat laffa was good but not great. They serve everything with pickles and coleslaw which are excellent.  For dinner we unable to order sandwiches, as you have to sit at the \"bar\" to be able to do that. We ordered a vegetable plate as an appetizer, a plate of fallalel with tahini, and a chicken shawarma.  The vegetable and appetizer plate was excellent, the fallalel average, and the shawarma dry and bland.  The lunch was probably 4 stars and the dinner 2 stars. This is how I arrived at my review. You have to wait awhile to be seated but service is brisk and pleasant. After finishing dinner we were asked how we enjoyed the food. When we said that we did not like the shawarma, the waitress did not know what do say. I guess everyone fawns at the food.   Its a good place to go for lunch, and great if you are looking for kosher food. The laffa breads themselves are terrific. As for shawarma and fallafel there is much better elsewhere."}
{"text":"I grew up near here and now live in another province. Each time I come to Toronto I eat there with my son or my friend. The food is amazing but each time we order two laffas, always the laffa, don't bother with the pita, we regret it because it is so much food, one is enough for two normal people.  To address the service, it is fine. I like the people behind the counter they have a good sense of humour and deliver on time."}
{"text":"The best laffa I'm the city.  Recommend getting the French fries, and the chicken schnitzel. I usually get the mango or malt star as a drink. Love this place so much."}
{"text":"This is the best Israeli restaurant outside of Israel.  In my humble opinion, it is the best middle eastern restaurant in town.  The food is influenced by Iraqi-Israeli cuisine.  The owners are from Jerusalem, and apparently are related to people who ran a pretty famous restaurant near the Mahaneh Yehuda Outdoor Market, which has the best food and produce in Jerusalem.     They start you off with 4-5 small salads to nibble on at no charge, which is very authentically Israeli.  The salads are simple and tasty, particularly the morrocan carrot salad.  Then they bring you Iraqi Pita, known as a Laffa in Israel, together with some Zehoug (green and very spicy and ubiquitous condiment popular in Israel, originating with immigrants to Israel from Yemen), together with Amba, a yellow Mango pickle paste popular with Iraqi Jews who came to Israel (it is lighter than the Indian mango pickle).  I have not had a bad main course there, and the appetizers, shakshouka, salads, and fried eggplant are excellent,  very authentic, and delicious.  The steak is also very good, and one can smell the wood charcoal burning from the kitchen.  The portions are generous and the food is great.  The atmosphere is noisy, busy and packed full of people, just like a good restaurant in Israel.  The service is attentive and helpful, given the relative commotion.    The food is Kosher, just like most Israeli grillhouses.  Every item on the menu, and I have had lots, is at a minimum good, and most are very good to excellent.  I miss the old bakery-food counter across the street, which was the former iteration of Dr. Laffa, because they used to make personalized Laffas with sesame, zaatar, nigella and /or whole wheat bread.  However, I am so glad the place is no longer vegetarian only, as the meat dishes are amazing.  I understand that given that Dr. Laffa is a full-blown restaurant now with a much higher volume of customers, they cannot personalize my laffas any longer.  I accept the trade-off.   The laffas are less fancy, but still very good. I have seen more than a few Iraqis and other middle easterners eating there.  Good food knows no boundaries."}
{"text":"Since I wrote this review I've been here twice again and it has always been PACKED. I tried the chicken shawarma and schnitzel hoping to see what everyone else seems to be seeing. I'm getting more used to it but still don't think its anything that special."}
{"text":"First off...The Magnetic Drive location surpasses their Bathurst and Lawrence location on any given day of the week. It was the first and original location and still reigns supreme! I went to the Bathurst location once and believe it or not, they did not have any shawarma left...That was the last time I went to that location (And it was 1pm btw, not even that late in the afternoon.)  But back to the Magnetic Drive location, please try the Shawarma Laffa here it is just fabulous. The big difference from Shawarma here than other places is the bread they use to put the meat on. Its a very traditional bread called laffa, it is very similar to Naan bread if you have had that before, its very fluffy, and super filling when packed with all the delicious fixing they have.(TIP: You can even add fries in your Laffa shawarma, not many people know about this, but they'll do it for you!). Also be warned don't ask for such \"white\" condiments so to speak like ketchup or Mayonnaise, because you may very well get kicked out :) Honestly try the Laffa Shawarma with all the fixing, experience it like it should be...You won't be disappointed.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"The go to place for a all-the-works Shawarma! The Value for money simply can't be beat.  Served in what they call Laffa bread, which seems a lot like the Lavash bread I am more used to than the pita bread you tend to see a lot of in N. America.  So they got the bread right.. working our way to the centre.    Their meats are tender and well spiced. The falafels are really good - moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. The chicken is succulent and freshly cut off the spinning griller. When not having the falafel sandwich, my other personal favorite is the kabab shawarma in laffa bread. The meat is a perfectly cooked and juicy with those beatiful fatty juices that bring the whole shawarma together.  The toppings - this is what can make or break your experience.  They have a massive collection of toppings and you have to choose carefully because there are some toppings that are sweet and could throw the taste off - unless you like a sweetish shawarma. Point being - know your taste preference and don't go with the \"i'll have all the toppings\" option.  The side's are all on point and reasonably priced. The ambience is jovial and energetic (read loud)."}
{"text":"Great falafel today, upsize to Laffa, good falafel 7 to 8 yummy falafel fresh nuggets were added to the hand stretched & freshly baked bread. They even opened doors 15 minutes early for me, very nice!  I'm impressed, altho the hot sauce was not to my taste"}
{"text":"Went there on a Sunday mid afternoon.. Place is small and was overly crowded.. Had to wait a long time to get service and food.. Food was good, the bread is very good and freshly made.. but I was disappointed that the only served sandwiches aka Laffa until early afternoon unless it was takeout.. Which is contradictory to the name Dr. Laffa!! Overall the food was good for me to visit again- but for take out since I wouldn't have to wait as long and I'd be able to get my Laffa!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed !!!! Can you say BLAND? We ordered a falafel and shwarma on hummous.  Kiddo had a rubber Laffa burger in a way too huge challah bun.  I simply make way better tasting food at home .  So I won't be returning and warn others to save your money and skip the hype. You DON'T gotta eat here! If you know what I mean . Shame too... I had high hopes.... Whoever says this is the best middle eastern food they have ever eaten is a friend or family member of dr laffa.  the food simply is not all that tasty...very run of the mill  remember i told you so!"}
{"text":"Delicious israeli style kosher food. Fast service. Family restaurant. Great for take out. Nice ppl. Great falafel balls and chummus."}
{"text":"Went to Dr. Laffa last week with a group after hearing some great things about it. I am a huge sandwich fan so when I was told this place was an Iraqi sandwich place I was very curious. Though after being there I think it might be more Israeli than Iraqi. It is kinda hard to find as it basically operates out of a loading dock at a factory but don't let this fool you!   I had the Sabih sandwich on laffa bread (around $6.50) which was a kind of fried eggplant dish served with veggies and a hardboiled egg topped with a spicy mango chutney.  The taste was awesome and the portion was MASSIVE (I was still full the next morning from it)!  The only thing wrong with this place is it is located so far from my house.  If I go back I would like to try the meal version (laffa on the side) w/ toppings laid out on the plate, but sandwich style was very good!  I definitely reccomend checking them out.  Note: This place is entirely vegitarian / kosher. They are going to be opening another location soon that serves meat dishes which I can't wait to try.  Overall: I would rank them a 4.5 out of 5 but rounded up with the stars system on here since a full 5 star review would have to really blow me away."}
{"text":"This took me a long time to write... it could happen to you.   This is not a review on the food, this is a review of the horrible service I received.  I could not have made this stuff up.  It was a crisp afternoon on Boxing Day 2013.  Been hearing a lot about this place for years so after a comic book run, my cousin's friend brought us there because it was his favourite shawarma in the city.  I couldn't wait!  I was in line and there was a shawarma shaver, a shawarma dresser and a cashier lady.  After the person in front of me was served it was my turn.  The shaver saw me but waved \"secretly\" the couple behind me to come to the front without me knowing.  The couple looking puzzled looked back at me and asked , \"What about him?  He was first.\"  The shaver looked at me and said, \"OK\", more like a \"OK, fine\" attitude and took my order then their order.  The shaver did not know who they were.  Weird.  After the dresser completed our order, I remember that he put more shawarma meat for the couple instead of ours but I just dismissed it.  Whatever, I was still getting the shawarma.  I went to side and was ready to cash out with the cashier lady.  I was in front of her showing my Visa at the register and not looking at me tells me to hold on as she was taking an order by phone.  She took the order and leaves to speak to the dresser on the side.  She comes back to the register and looks at the couple who was originally behind me now standing beside me to my left and asks, \"Is there anything to drink?\" and decides to cash them out FIRST!!!!!  I was right in FRONT of her and the register with my card and she was not making eye contact with me.  I had to step back courteously so the couple could come and cash out.  What was that?  Ridiculous!  When the couple was cashing out, the cashier was speaking to them in their language.  I was pretty floored that both times I was pushed to the side and not given that first come-first served service.  Horrible!  After the couple had left, she cashed me out and was terribly nice to us and guided us to our seats.  Too little, too late.  Had the shawarma, but I had already lost my appetite.  Honestly, it was not the best I have had.  I could not believe what had just happened to me.  They decided to favour the people of their race to be served first.  This is TORONTO and I have never been treated like a second class citizen due to being of Filipino descent.  I was completely speechless when all this was happening and am kicking myself that I didn't leave initially or speak up about the service.  It is a wake up call that racism still exists here.    I will never, Ever, EVER go back to Dr Laffa."}
{"text":"**featured on 'You Got to eat Here\"** that's why we gave it a shot, here is the scoop:  *Crowded Jewish place which I love, small though but cozy *No value for the money, you must Try Hanna's Shawerma, best value, exact menu, better portions * One must say that sandwitch (Laffa) is huge, yes it is heavy and huge but no meat (protein) inside, full of veggies, pickels and the bread itself is heavy and big * I ordered 2 skewers of chicken ($17)...I must say, if you take one chicken thigh and cut it into 12 pieces and put each 6 on a skewer...that is the 2 skewer size..typical Canada though, no value for what you pay and you can't get a real satisfying meal for the $$ * Go again? no..Hanna's shawerma in Richmond Hil/Vaughn way better  * Hummus with ground beef and pine nuts, sounds great actually but when I tried it...it doesn't match..no relation inbetween...like when you put Brittney Spears with Bill Gates.... * Flavor...mediocre * Servers are stressed out from the volume..try their best...but stressed from the volume."}
{"text":"I've been hearing a lot about Dr. Laffa recently, and its new 'dine-in' location so I have finally made it out for dinner with a friend this past week.  What makes Dr. Laffa special? It is the laffa, which is a crispy flatbread seasoned with za'atar, made in a tabun oven.  The best part is it's complimentary - think of it as the Iraqi version of a bottomless bread basket.  You can eat as much as you want!  We ended up eating two.  The new location offers an extended menu, with a full selection of appetizers, main courses and desserts.  Along with the laffa bread, you're served a number of complimentary appetizers mainly consisting of marinated vegetable dishes with white cabbage, purple cabbage, corn, carrots, pickles and olives.  Some sweet, others sour and spicy.  If that wasn't enough, you also get delicious dipping sauces skhug and amba.  We found eight different varieties of humus to choose from, so I went for sautéed mushroom humus.  I truly enjoyed this dish.  For the main course, the main choices are shawarma, kabab or other grilled meats.  We ordered lamb chops.  With your dinner you get to choose a side of french fries, potato or vegetables.  The lamb was made to perfection, just as I expected.  Fair warning, if you are not into fatty meat on the bone, I would not recommend you order this dish.  We tried the grilled eggplant.  The skin was overly charred, but the eggplant was very soft and tasty.  The meal was very filling, definitely a great dinner.   I also liked the \"family\" atmosphere.  The food was good but a bit pricey ($28 for the lamb), but overall, I would still recommend this place."}
{"text":"The quaility during the second time around at Dr. Laffa was somewhat disappointing. I don't think that I will return again as the trek isn't worth it. The laffa shawarma was not flavourful and they didn't serve the starter salads as they did the first time we went. Because of the inconsistency, I would have to downgrade this restaurant rating to 2.5 stars. I am curious to try other laffa places to compare."}
{"text":"I recently had the wonderful pleasure of enjoying a delecious healthy order of lamb and chicken skewers with flavourful Israeli Salad and fries and a yummy plate of falafel balls with tahini from this great location for my very delecious supper. Everything was so super delecious. Absolutely the best Mediterranean cuisine I have ever had in my entire life. The falafel balls were absolute heaven. The best falafel, ever. So nutritious too. Even better than the falafel I had when I was physically in the Middle East. Piping hot and very delecious. Big portions. I sipped a can of delecious peach juice, imported from Israel, with my dinner. The best juice I've had in a long time. Reasonable price. Staff was very courteous, friendly, efficient, and cheerful. Conveniently located at Bathurst and Lawrence. Plenty of parking. Very frequently running TTC bus stops literally at doorstep. Thank you, Dr.Laffa, for the awesome heavenly food and I look forward to ordering up from your great location again and again. Shalom."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today and was incredibaly impressed. Had the falafel laffa..huge portion with so many toppings. Such awesome customer service as well. Falafel was made fresh to order, toppings like sweet potato, eggplant, turnips, pickles, hummus, fries..too many to name. Will definitely come back and recommend to friends and family"}
{"text":"After reading so many reviews online, I decided to finally try it. For a store that was featured on Food Network, I had high hopes going in. As I go through the door, I'm confused on where to order. There was just a jumble of people crowded around the glass. After yelling over the crowd to the man behind the counter, my order was placed. Visually, I looked very appetizing. There was a lot of colour and ingredients going into it, so I was expecting an amazing circus of wonderful flavours. 2 decent sized sandwiches cost me a whopping 29 dollars. So now I was really expecting a real feast. 3 minutes later I got home, and overall, I was really disappointed. The flavours didn't go together. The chicken had a lack of texture and flavour. It was greasy, and just a mess of uncomplimenting flavours. It did though fill me up, so at least i payed for something that filled me up."}
{"text":"Great food, but be patient.  Went to see the \"DR\" last week for lunch with a couple of buddies...firstly, the place is packed at lunch.. we arrived around 1:00 and it was like we had walked in at noon.  If you are luck y enough to get a seat at a table (there is a long takeout line and some counters for single diners) you'll probably have to wait a while to get a) menus, b) order taken, c) bill.  The food is fantastic, we had Shakshuka, Shwarma and the Humous with Beef... all were killer flavours and way too much food.  I had the Shakshuka with lamb merguez and it was, for me, just enough and amazing flavours.  Unfortunately our waitress disappeared a couple of times and we had to spend a lot of time waiting for the bill...kind of ruined the experience.  I'd suggest that anyone in a rush for lunch go someplace else, anyone looking for great food at a great price take a swing by the only restaurant on Magnetic Drive."}
{"text":"Great shwarma. That's what brought me to Dr Laffa the first few times and keeps me coming back to this incredibly popular spot, located in an industrial complex, of all places.  The shwarma in a laffa ($10) is right on: lots of spit-cooked sliced lamb (not chicken) with assorted veggies, hummus, tehina and hot sauce in the on-site-cooked fluffy, chewy laffa is delicious (and has my mouth watering as I write the review). The shish kebob laffa sandwich was nearly as good, plenty covered in tehina, but otherwise a healthier option. The shakshuka ($8) is authentic and quite peppery, served in the pan it's cooked in.  Service is pretty bad unless you're a native Russian or Hebrew speaker, otherwise expect to be relatively ignored. Food does come relatively quickly after ordering. Occasionally will have the TV on watching soccer, etc. in Hebrew. Does a mean and popular take-out business.  Fair warning: sandwiches, e.g. laffas ($5-10+tax, etc.), are only served until 5 during the week and 1 on Sunday, so if you're coming for dinner, expect to be paying for a proper entree ($12-29)."}
{"text":"A solid 4-4.5*  Warning:  There are some weird ordering rules, e.g. you cannot order a pita/laffa for dine-in, after 1pm on a Sunday unless you're eating at the \"bar\" which is more like a raised counter.  I asked the owner why they had this rule and he said that Sundays are particularly busy, so they like to reserve the tables for patrons ordering entrées.  Sorta makes sense, sorta.  Aside from the Sunday, there are other day/times where this applies and it's listed on the menu, above the sandwiches.  After finding out this rule, I was gonna do a take-out, but the owner said, \"Why don't you sitdown and eat??\"  So I just gave him my take away and he put it on a dish for me.    Tip:  If you're sitting at the bar, sit away from the salad bar area as that's where the grills are located and it gets hot.  Restaurant itself is quite small, maybe 10 tables.  Located in a weird, industrial area.  YES, Shwarma Laffa - exactly like a lighter naan, but no real taste - is $9.99, but it's literally a foot long and at least 4\" in height.  There were tons of \"salad\"/sauce options that were included at no additional costs.  Shwarma meat was nicely seasoned, not too salty.  And out of all the veggies, I really like their sliced, roasted eggplant.  Sauces:  AMBA - tasted like a creamy curry, but apparently it's made out of pickled mangoes.  They also had this really nice, spicy green sauce that had green chillis, coriander, & garlic.  Also included are these free side dishes of \"salads\", basically the stuff that's included in your laffa.  All the staff were nice and friendly.  Definitely a unique dining experience frequented by many from the Jewish community with fresh 'n tasty food!"}
{"text":"This place is great! One Chicken Shawarma Laffa is big enough to feed two people! There is so much going on in the Shawarma that I enjoyed every bite. You can ask to get some chips in your shawarma as well. That extra crunch is always good. Their roasted eggplant is just cooked right. I seriously enjoyed this shawarma, and this place is easily my favourite shawarma place in Toronto. AND the shawarma was stuffed with Chicken, which was cooked very well. It was moist and flavourful.   It might seem a bit pricey (10.99 for a Chicken Shawarma Laffa) but it is very hard to finish 1/2 of one. Even if you are really hungry, I would say finishing one would be very hard as well!"}
{"text":"I am a bit of a foodie as my business requires that I dine out almost every day.  Dr Laffa is not the prettiest place in perhaps the least pretty strip mall in Toronto, but man is it good.  I mean really freaking good.  I think of those massive rolls of heaven every time I am hungry.  I think I would choose as my last meal a chicken Laffa with heaps of beets, coleslaw, tahini and hummus over virtually any other food.  Please go here and see for yourself."}
{"text":"The laffa was too thin so the sandwich kept falling apart.  Service wise the place is great but food wise it is ok meaning that I will not go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"I've been hearing a lot about Dr. Laffa since it opened. And I was wary of it. It's located in the middle of an industrial area, hidden in the middle of G-d knows where and I couldn't see the place survive in its current location.  I was proven wrong SEVERELY. The taste and the atmosphere of Dr. Laffa is something to be admired. It isn't your typical restaurant but its so good that you don't want to leave. Get the laffa pita its made in front of you and it is absolutely FANTASTIC. When I was there they were giving out samples to people in line of different things they offer which I HAVE NEVER SEEN AT A KOSHER RESTAURANT (HINT). They give a really good reason to return. And that reason is the food. They are also priced below the kosher competition in Toronto ($11 for a Shawarma Laffa + Drink vs. $17 for a Shawarma Pita + Drink). Check it out, that is if you can find the place."}
{"text":"3.5 - but I gotta round down. The ingredients are great and flavorful. The employees are super nice. This place is EXPENSIVE for what you get. I ordered a pita and a laffa shawarma - $26 bucks later. Was it good? yes...but the pita cracked in so many places I ended up putting it all on a plate. I can truly say this place has the potential to be the best shawarma place in the city - but that is based on taste of the ingredients. The price, as well as the mess I got (fork + Plate) means I gotta round down."}
{"text":"Best shawarma I've had in Toronto!  The shawarmas here are massive and absolutely stuffed with a huge diversity of ingredients (hummus, cole slaw, pickles, pickled carrots, roasted eggplants) in addition to some extremely flavourful and juicy chicken. They come in a smaller size in a pita ($9) or the giant size in a laffa ($12). The shawarma joints downtown are a joke by comparison."}
{"text":"Freshly baked laffa bread rolling out from a stone oven built behind the counter of toppings, already good news for some.   Why? Anything made right in front of our eyes bring us back to the joys of cookie baking with mama! Bound to have better quality than grocery bought cookies which is why this laffa is no lafffing matter when it comes to just that, goodness.  Every shawarma toppings available according to personal taste between sour and spice. I love eggplant, so imagine my delight in having to opt for a medley of shawarma goodness with this bad boy.  The owners and their staff are equally amazing in keeping you entertained while they make your grub. So friendly and patient while you decide on many tongue tantalizing menu choices which I have yet to try and enjoy.  Only downside is the very tight parking space in front of the resto located on busy Bathurst so my best bet is to avoid lunch time and rush hour altogether."}
{"text":"Where's the garlic? Where's the spice?   A very \"ashkenaz\" version of Israeli cuisine. I get why they may have chosen to go with more bland flavours to accommodate its clientele but the price you pay is a loss of authenticity.  The taste doesn't remind me of the country of origin.  Although they seem to make laffa in the traditional fashion I find the laffa rubbery here. I've gone to both locations and it's consistent. Even the schug (hot sauce) that they offer is barely spicy. I asked them to go crazy with that topping and they did, but it barely moved the needle. Their schug is a sort of watery green one.  Another issue is the prices. Holy moly I've never paid $10 +tax for a shawarma! $18 +tax for chicken kebab?? What the heck?!  Super nice staff who work as quickly as possible to meet the demands of a clientele that can be a bit obnoxious when asking for difficult-to-fulfill preferences during busy times. They have the patience of saints when it comes to this.  All in all it seems like they know the tastes of their customers and are smart to cater to their palate, so ultimately my opinion means little here unless you, like me, are looking for the genuine article. If you are, then the closest thing in town is Ghazale at Bloor and Bathurst (not Israeli but pretty delicious)."}
{"text":"Today I came with Sebouh, we were skeptical at first, however, we were truly amazed we decided to come. We order a hummus with shawarma, a hummus with fried eggplant and a salad. It came with a laffa, which means flat bread that came out of the oven fresh. We were not disappointed at all! Oh it also came with 3 side dishes to start. The place was packed and people kept on coming in. I will be back to try other foods on the menu! Until next time!"}
{"text":"Came in here for what we thought would be a quick lunch on the go. Big mistake. These laffas are messy to eat. This is what happens when you make a wrap comprised mainly of wet ingredients (lettuce, pickles, coleslaw, purple cabbage, corn, tzatziki). Results is a soggy wrap, especially since we didn't eat it right away. That's not to say they weren't delicious. With all the different ingredients and textures, each bite is bursting in flavour. The chicken was moist and well seasoned. These laffas are enormous for 10.99. Best to share one. Would probably come back but only if I was really hungry, and was sitting down to eat with a bunch of napkins on standby."}
{"text":"Used to be one of my top spots for Shawarma, but has gone a bit downhill in the past year.  Still good food, and the price for what you get is amazing - the laffa's are huge and crammed full with meat and only cost about $10-$13.  However, for the past few visits, the meat (mostly Shawarma and Chicken Kebob) has been really dry and just not that good. The laffa was a bit bland (I swear they used to put a lot more toppings inside) and it no longer stands out as being better than any other shawarma place.   Great for a quick, easy lunch - servers are friendly and prompt. Food comes out quickly after you order. Really caters to people who are on their lunch breaks.  I will be back since I often work in the area, but will sadly  no longer be my number one spot."}
{"text":"Falafel, shawarma, shish kebob, schnitzel sandwiches made with either pita or their signature laffa bread. The laffa sandwiches are gigantic. I love the doughy fresh out of the oven laffas on their own. The sandwiches are a bit dry and bland and very different from the typical street shawarmas. A friend who ordered the dinner had the same complaint."}
{"text":"Sometimes I don't really trust my GPS. I want to ask \"Do you know where you taking me to??\" This is one of those occasion when that it use it sexy European accent to ask me to turn right into this industrial area....  Dr Laffa is one of those places you would not know unless you read about it somewhere else (Yelp) or your friend told you....  Busy place during lunch hour as I waiting for my lunch date to arrive... and the first thing she said I have to have the Shakshuka.... \"It is SOOOOO Good!\"  Shakshuka is a breakfast/brunch dish or good as a hangover cure. Maybe she knows that I have a few beers the night before and I look like I just woke up. Shakshuka Special with Meguez Sausage ($9.99)... did make my tummy nice and warm... It tastes great with the fresh Laffa!! (btw it is complimentary!)  While waiting for my food, we were snacking on the free little plates of appetizer mainly pickled veggies.  Free refills are offered and no wonder my date was half full even before her Rice with Beans ($7.99) arrived.  Service here is exceptionally good... and pricing is reasonable for a Kosher restaurant especially if you can eat a lot of those Laffa...   FYI, I can just eat those Laffa and be happy!"}
{"text":"What can I say :) this place takes me back to Israel the food is 10/10. Now there is not much room but I think they are expanding. Don't believe this person \"Faye\" the food ROCKS make sure you are ready to eat."}
{"text":"Food was extremely cold. Ordered the gyro \"shwarama\" if you could call it that. This was literally a pita and a salad with dry meat. The meat was poorly seasoned and looked like dog ...... . How this place can call this a shwarama just hurts my soul. And don't get me started with the price.....  Overall:  1/5 food   For this price I would rather go to Lazeez and Osmows."}
{"text":"The best authentic Iraqi food ever  ... I've never tasted such falafel since I left iraq .. I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Since this was my second visit to Dr. Laffa, I thought I should write a review.  Honestly, unless you are a meat eater, you will starve. The Laffa bread is yummy and so is the hummus. My husband thought the shwarma was good as well. The salmon skewer was terribly over cooked and tough and also not worth the $11.99 price.  Service was a whole other ball game!  It truly sucked. We waited forever for someone to take our order and the food was not placed in front of us in a pleasant fashion. No one asked if we wanted anything else nor were we approached again after receiving our meal.  This restaurant caters to people who like a big sandwich and little service. I suppose you get what you pay for.  Would I go back? Not likely."}
{"text":"I went to Dr Laffas on Bathurst to pick up lunch today.   Go f one falafel and one chicken schawarma in a laffa wrap.   I got most of the condiments in it .  F hey are extremely large.  It cost about $20 for both of them.  You need to eat them quickly because they fall apart when you get to the bottom.  I shared t with my friend so we tasted both.  They were very good.  Maybe not the best i have ever had but a very filling lunch.  I couldnt finish it all."}
