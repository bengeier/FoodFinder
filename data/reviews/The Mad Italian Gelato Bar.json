{"text":"I love this place! The service is fantastic and the atmosphere is friendly! The gelato is incredible. They have some great flavours and make waffle cones fresh. 
I live in the neighbourhood and this is definitely by knew gelato place! They've won me over from Il Gelaterie that has extremely poor and rude customer service."}
{"text":"The place is electric and fun and the Gelato for sure enjoyable, but who need to eat a full meal at a gelato bar? I am lost with their new food menu....  What's wrong with the always winner crepes, waffles, etc. What's about creative dessert?  What's next? 6am egg breakfast? Midnight wine bar? Crossover are good on the road but my stomach is more touch..."}
{"text":"food - gelato is nice and creamy, the choice of flavors is large

service - on a friday or saturday night it the summer it feels like a school cafeteria, service is brisk and friendliness optional

atmosphere - none, get your cone, cup or whatever and leave. The line is usually eating into the dining space anyways on summer evenings

price - one scoop is more than $4, this is quite outrageous compared to the price of a premium pint of ice cream, competition, or the cost of making great ice-cream yourself. 

The food gets a 4, the value gets a 2 making this a 3."}
{"text":"Good flavours of gelato, have not tried Zazzu (?) which apparently they are now famous for, but I probably won't be back and wouldn't advise anyone to try other things on the menu (besides the gelato) as no one knows whats in the food they are serving.

In the summer for lunch one day I went inside. Checked out what they had in the fridge window and asked for the (labelled) vegetarian pasta. After I had paid and took it to my table, I inspected it further (I always do just to make sure), and found pieces of what looked like meat. Brought it back up to the front and asked again if they were sure it was vegetarian, oh yup they're sure. Asked one of the staff to try it to ensure that it was not meat. Guess what, it was. They called one of the employees that worked earlier and they had used meat in it.

They offered me other options in it's place, but at the time their menu was not very big and I didn't enjoy what they offered me.

They did give me a free gelato (which was delicious).
While I do appreciate the gesture to replace what I had paid for, I am glad that I took a look at the dish before I ate it. Things like this do not give me faith and trust in a business."}
{"text":"Awesome!! Awesome!! Try a pizza cone today. Had the meatball pizza and it was so good.... was 'mmmmmmm'ing the whole time. Service was so good i tipped almost 25% fand gelato was to die for. Try the grapefruit, ferrero rocher and fig :)"}
{"text":"Decent Italian food at a great price. Half the time the hot dishes are lukewarm."}
{"text":"Ok. so the last time I went there was not too long after they opened this location. 

I tried the gelato and cannol. Meh, I was not really impress. It was over sweeten and I could not taste what the food was really. That was the first and last time I went there."}
{"text":"On a Sunday night after dinner time (around 7:30pm) it was super busy with families and young couples lining up for their post meal sweet rewards

I brought the parents here because we've tried Dolce, and Hollywood and this is by far the best Gelato in Toronto so far. 

When you get there, it's a mess of people, and you don't know really where to stand, order or who to talk to. I thought, at first, the guy was being really rude, telling us to pay first, and then order. And I was annoyed at the people taking their sweet time. 
But. 

When it became our turn, we did the same, and the guy was very patient with us trying all the flavours before we made a choice. We had two flavours set in our minds, and when I asked for a recommendation for a 3rd, he was unable to give us an answer, which made the whole process even slower. 
In the end, we got a perfect trio, Ferrero Rocher, Pistachio, No Sugar Raseberry. 

What they also need to do, is separate the Sobettos from the Gelattos to make it easier for a avoidy dairy person like me to choose, or at least have some distinguishing mark. Yes, you can assume all fruit is Sorbets but it's easier to see it physically. 

Lots of seating, outside, a little cramped in doors."}
{"text":"I like this place - cozy and simple 
cappuccino is strong and nice here - the way I like it 
love the gelato as well
been there twice now whenever I go to the merchant of tennis shop."}
{"text":"I've met my share of Mad Italian's in my neck of the Wood(bridge)s.  None of whom sold me any Gelato, at least not Moosehead Lager Gelato.  The solo staff showed and executed full effort on her part along with slight frazzled appearance.  The space design reminds me of a couple spots of the same Food Category in Downtown near Little Italy(Dolce to be precise).

Medium(3 Flavour $4.75[?])  -  [Moosehead(White), Green Tea(Green), Dairy Free Chocolate(Black)]

As I asked for their Dark Chocolate Gelato as I do at every place, it seems that it didn't exist and the staff suggested the closest flavour being the Dairy-Free Chocolate which had more of a chunky texture reminds me of Brownie Chunks.  I guess I'm not turning Dairy-Free anytime soon.   3.5'd

Green Tea was actually advertised with a Sandwich-Board outside near the road-side Patio space as a new flavour.  A take on Green Tea Ice Cream and it does a decent enough job as an alternative.  Mind you I'm not going to stop chugging down Green Tea Ice Cream at AYCE Jap places.

On to Moosehead.......   What do you need to know?  Beer-flavour!

But then I might be bias as I'm quite picky on alcoholic consumption methods while having an uneducated palette for alcohol in general.  It means I don't drink much and when I do, I like unconventional means of intake.  Gelato being one such method."}
{"text":"I can't quite agree with Kate that it is the best gelato I've ever had, but it IS very good.  Lots of flavours and true soft gelato texture.  Friendly counter people."}
{"text":"A new gelato place has opened on Bayview, almost directly across the street from Hollywood Gelato!  (It is actually slightly south, by about a 2 minute stroll.)

We ordered a small cup (2 flavours) and a medium cup (3 flavours), which came to about $9.  My friend had grapefruit and mango.  Both were tart and delicious.  I went on the sweeter side and had dulce de leche, tiramisu, and ferrero rocher.

The dulce de leche, always my favorite gelato, was so creamy and delicious.  My other two flavours were good too, but the tiramisu gelato that I've had at  Hollywood Gelato was better.  

Homemade waffle cones were being made at the front of the shop while we were there - I'll try one next time."}
{"text":"It's simple: this is the best gelato I've ever eaten.  The flavors are true, and so fresh-tasting!  The pastries & lunch menu are DELICIOUS, and the coffee is strong.  What's not to love??

If you want real, Italian gelato, this is the place!"}
{"text":"Great' tiramisu flavour is the best i've had in toronto."}
{"text":"Yes this place serves gelato. But the real reason to go here is the pizza cones!

What's a pizza cone you may ask? Why is pure geometric pleasure. Imagine pizza served in a dough cone. That my friends is pizza cones.

Gimmicky? not really - it's a different experience for pizza. Pure cheesy goodness."}
{"text":"This place is like heaven!! Ferrero Roche gelato!!! Why didn't someone tell me about this earlier?! Heaven in my mouth. I can't wait to go back. The service was great, the girls were very attentive and polite. The coffee was amazing too. I had an americano, by far the best I've had. Better than Starbucks! Yes I said it! Better than Starbucks! Anyway, this place would have gotten 5 stars but their pastries need work. I asked the girl if they made them there and at first she said yes, and then later she mentioned they came 3 days ago? Didn't make much sense. Next time I'll just get the gelato and coffee."}
{"text":"Enjoying Gelato on the patio in a nice hot summer night, that alone worth that extra 1 star for my Yelp reviewing rating for The Mad Italian Gelato Bar

Yes it is a Bar... as here they serves beers, wine and liquors too!!

Great choices of Gelato flavours and staffs were friendly and helpful while I sampled a few of the offerings before my decisions!

$3.75 for a small with 2 flavours which I settled on my usual Pistachio and Dark Chocolate since Moosehead Lager was unavailable this evening.

Soft and rich and full of wholesome flavours! 

Gelato, Summer, Patio! The Mad Italian Gelato Bar is a Winner!"}
{"text":"Been here twice so far, and am loving their nutty flavours.
I'm talking nociola (hazelnut); pistachio; bacio; ferrero rocher...

Small (2 flavours) = $3.75;
Med. (3 flavours) = $4.75.

Service is good.
I'd go again.  Heck, I'd frequent any gelato place in little Italy it seems.  :)"}
