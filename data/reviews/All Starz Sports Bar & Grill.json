{"text":"This place was between decent enough and ehh... I'm totally up for a good dive bar experience once in a while, but dive bars are supposed to be cheap and this place is not. I went last night for a going away party and ordered a beer, a double shot of jager (for the guy going away :) and a diet coke- $18. It was clean enough, there was good music, LOTS of games on, even the guys at the open mic weren't bad, but I thought these places are supposed to be about drinking cheap. Oh well, if you go stick to bud light in a bottle :("}
{"text":"All Starz is my one of my favorite local watering holes...  In the past year or so they have changed ownership and have upped the ante on the sports visibility.  Many games and a couple of huge projection screens.  They also play a lot of the UFC fights...

They did get rid of the shuffleboard table... that lost them a star."}
{"text":"Typical sports bar atmosphere with a lively crowd. Good things: they have live entertainment on Tuesdays and Saturdays, Karoake, Texas hold 'em, and other fun events. They also offer pool, shuffleboard, darts, video games, and of course, many televisions for all your sports veiwing needs. Bad things: the crowd was a little too loud/rough for me, but hey, it's a sports bar."}
{"text":"All-Starz is a pretty cool spot to go to watch whatever game it is that might be playing.

The place gets packed though and the crowd yells, LOUD.  But that's to be expected at most sports bars.

The food is the normal bar fare, but it comes out pretty fast and prices are reasonable.  They're usually having some sort of drink special or a promotion going on, so be sure to ask your server before ordering. They used to have specific specials for every day of the week, so unless things have changed, ask about that too."}
