{"text":"Good pho! Very flavourful. Not a lot of grease. The atmosphere was nice because we went there at 2 pm and it only had 4 other customers so it was very quiet and relaxing unlike other pho's we've been to. It was a bit dark because if their decor but it felt cozy."}
{"text":"I love pho....had it all over town on TO's best list...and the little pho fuzion spot seemed so invisible tucked in their little corner of a strip mall.  MAN WAS I WRONG!  Should have been going here from day one.  The pho broth is unreal!!  Had the BBQ Pork Pho and the meat was tasty, noodles were a nice texture, and they packed the hearty servings with all the lovely trimmings like lime and fresh basil...hoisin and sirracha, mmmmm.  They nail it at this affordable little spot.  For the cost, and quality, i would recommend any pho lover to give it a try."}
{"text":"I was on my way to Heartland and then came a sudden craving for pho.  I didn't want to go to the standard \"99\" because, well, let's be honest, they all taste about the same and follow the exact same recipe.   As I was driving up, I remembered there was a place on Bristol called Pho Fuzion and always wanted to try it out.    This place is designed pretty nice and has a good homey feel to it (but not divey).   I had the standard pho and the deep fried bean curd.  The deep fried bean curd was nice and crispy and absolutely delicious.  I would give this 4 stars.    With regards to the pho, the broth was pretty good.  It was quite tasty.  The only issue I had with this was the lack of meatballs in the pho and not enough meat in general.  I expect one or two in my pho.  If it just had two meatballs, a tad more meat, then I'd give this place 4 stars.  Sadly I can only give 3.5 stars.    Overall though, I'd visit again."}
{"text":"It's not bad, but it's not great either.  The servings are small, basically, a large is equal to a medium.  They sell their own canned hot chilli oil and hot sauce, which is interesting.  The place is clean, but quite dark, has a nice mural on one wall and  pretty decoration.  I had the large pho, the broth was tasty, it wasn't oily, the veggies were fresh and there was sufficient amount of meat in the soup.  Also ordered the appetizer platter, they were nice as well.  I liked the sugar cane appetizer.  The servings are just really small, or smaller than other pho places, so I kinda felt ripped off when my large came out looking like a small to medium bowl.  I wouldn't say that I would purposely come back here, but if I was in the area, then maybe I would go back."}
{"text":"Today I had some food at Pho Fuzion, my family was a company of about 25 people. It wasn't busy and we were seated right away. We occupied four tables in the restaurant, only one other couple came in after us. In terms of design and setting, I think it's pretty cool they also have booths, as to the traditional only chairs and tables normally seen in Pho restaurants. It looked modern and had a relatively chilling atmosphere. The Jays game was on, but unfortunately they only have basic cable, mind you it's a restaurant and not a bar.  We ordered Pho, Vermicelli, and Com (Rice) dishes with side orders such spring rolls and rice paper rolls. I had the rice with pork chop, sunny side up eggs, and shrimps. I shared this plate with my son, I also ate most of the sides at my table. I was hungry! The rice serving were adequate, the pork chop was tasty, but I found the shrimp were too small. My wife had thought she ordered the jumbo shrimp. I received a small bowel of Pho broth, I found it to be a little on the salty side, but I think most Pho restaurants make it like this, personally I like it to be less salty. I didn't pay attention to the quantity given in the Pho, I didn't hear any complaints after the visit so I presume it was okay.  The service was good as our waitress attended to our needs, including simple things like heating up my daughters and nephews jar baby food, twice. I have a big family with even more people then those who showed up today, addressing our needs and requests from the individuals seated at different tables is appreciated. Overall it's a pretty good experience as I ate all my food, I had the pickled lime drink, but that was just okay. I didn't see the bill, but my understanding is it was reasonable even for a party of 25 people which included lots of children. We would visit again."}
{"text":"A friend was craving pho but unfortunately his favourite spot is currently closed. So we all decided to try out Pho Fuzion after the good reviews on Yelp. I've passed by this restaurant so many times since they opened and have yet to try their food until tonight.  We arrived close to 7 pm and it was quite empty. We were seated promptly and received the menus and tea immediately. The server/owner doesn't talk to you unless you have any questions etc. We all ordered pho and it came out relatively quickly. The broth tasted pretty good and the garnishes provided were fresh. The noodles were good, had enough meat and had several meatballs.  Overall, we all enjoyed our pho and I would definitely drop by again to try something else."}
{"text":"Poor service. Bubble tea tapioca was rock hard and the replacement was not much better, as they left the taro slush on the counter for 15 minutes while cooking new tapioca.  Pad Thai was overpowered by ketchup flavour. We weren't asked for water or anything to drink for 5 mins after sitting. Not once were we asked how the food was, if we need more water, etc.   I would never come back here personally. 2 stars only because the pho, spicy noodle and shrimp spring rolls were tasty."}
