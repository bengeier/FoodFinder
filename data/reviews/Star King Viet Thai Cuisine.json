{"text":"The Pho here is fantastic. I had almost given up on finding delicious Pho in this city, and never expected to find it here in midtown.   I would travel across the city to eat this Pho any day."}
{"text":"Price is okay but the soup is lousy. The place was not even make authentic Vietnamese soup. They missed quite a lot of ingredients and flavour, make it the last place I wanted to go for comfort food downtown Toronto. I would not recommend it. Pro: The washroom made up for the fact that this place is not owned by Vietnamese."}
{"text":"Great food and great price. Never experienced slow service as some of the reviews indicated below. This isn't a fancy place, if anything it's a bit of a whole in the wall. But, it's clean, the food and portions are great and you can't beat the price. Try the grilled beef on rice with a spring roll  and lots of hot sauce."}
{"text":"Another very average North American based Vietnamese restaurant that serves mediocre tasting Vietnamese food. Their noodle based options are just to oily , not fresh enough , and at times one can feel it's simply either overlooked or reheated more than once :-("}
{"text":"Food taste like absolute garbage. We had to wait 10 minutes for service, then another 30-40 minutes for 1 dish to come out.  We ordered a total of 4 dishes, with 1 dish being white rice which they forgot to bring us even after reminding the waitress 3 times.    The 1 dish that did come out was a simple stir fry sweet/sour chicken.  It tasted soggy and bland with some pieces of the chicken still cold - I'm pretty sure they microwaved it because there was an 'old sock smell' lingering on it.  I took about 3 bites then said to myself, \"F this sh!t, I don't feel like giving myself diarrhea tonight\" so I asked the waitress for the bill and to cancel our other dishes that still didn't come yet.  (Pretty sure they forgot to make those as well) She then asks why, so I tell her it's because the food tasted like 3 day old microwaved soggy styrofoam and their service was absolute poo.  Imagine throwing a phone book in to a tub of milk then biting in to the dripping wet phone pages - that's what it tasted like.  The funny thing was how the manager started arguing and yelling at us saying fried chicken is supposed to taste soggy, and that it was the sauce that made it soggy.  Nope, even the ghetto box sweet/sour chicken I buy in chinatown is crunchier than the one they've served me.   Also, it doesn't explain the wet newspaper smell coming from the chicken.    We ended up paying for the bill (it was $8-$10) and went to the Wendy's next door because we were starving at this point.  I'm predicting that this restaurant will either be shut down by the health department or go bankrupt....... unless it's being used as a money laundering front because it's a full blown miracle if they stay open for longer than 6 months.  Summary: Eat at star king if you like diahrea chicken and managers that talk smack at you  when you try to leave."}
{"text":"This is so fun.. eating Pho in an abandoned Kelseys.    This place was busy when we went in for dinner.  This place was hot.. and i mean hot!  They need some ventilation.. i had to take strip down to my t-shirt it was so warm.  The food was mediocore.. ordered a Chicken Pad Thai.. so saucy, and there was like some microscopic chicken pieces in there somewhere. Thai Curry Laska, again with the microscopic chicken pieces... we're talking like 5 grams of meat!  Finally the Pho arrived.. why does it take 20 mins to bring me a bowl of Pho?   Wouldn't return for the food, but would because of the comfy booths."}
{"text":"Tried this one out a few times and was never disappointed. It's not world class crusine but they serve comfy food. I like their pho and my wife loves their laksa. Also, their Thai milk tea is very tasty.   You probably will never find another vietnamese restaurant with such comfortable seatings and such a child friendly restroom. This is all thanks to Kesley, which was the previous occupant of the location.  Good for family with or without kids. The owner walks around the restaurant quite a bit, so you can grab him for a chat if you want.  The only issue I have is that they share their parking spots with T&T and it's hard to find an empty spot."}
{"text":"Very delicious pho, really enjoyed it. Prompt service and fair price.  Will return in the future!"}
{"text":"I work in the area and was craving pad thai for lunch few weeks ago. So I walked over during my lunch and picked up food to go. I ordered the regular pad thai with a side of the Vietnamese Fresh Shrimp Rolls.   I've never been so disappointed in something that I've ordered before. The pad thai was super oily and wasn't warm (my work is a 5 minute walk). The rolls smelled pretty bad. I took a small bite from one and threw the rest out, same with the pad thai. What a waste of food!  If I wasn't so busy with work, I would've walked over and asked to speak with the manager about this.   I don't see myself visiting again after my bad experience."}
{"text":"Decor -5 out of 5 Service -5 out of 5 Food- simply delicious. This is hands down my favorite Vietnamese restaurant. The pho is amazing and so flavourful!  I would recommend it to anybody who wants to give a try to Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"I live downtown but happened to be near eglinton late afternoon (Wednesday night around 7pm).  After trying many pho places downtown, I found Star King to be one of best ones. Ordered an XL sized pho out of a combination of ambition and hunger, but was taken by surprise by the absolutely gigantic portion. I couldn't finish half of the food!! Had to pack it home :p  Moving along to the taste. DELICIOUS. The broth was a little on the greasier side but I ordered the option with tendon so the rich taste was to be expected. The shrimp rolls (vietnese style-shrimp, bean sprouts, vermicelli and lettuce wrapped in rice paper served with hoisin sauce and peanuts) were mouth watering. I found the shrimp rolls here exceed the ones made by popular viet restaurants downtown like Pho Hung.  Some comments below addressed long wait time. My experience was pleasant, the food came pretty speedily. Maybe I was just lucky today or maybe the restaurant actually does better now.   One thing that STANDS OUT to me is the service. Very friendly and kind staff. My friend paid the bill by card because I had cash to pay her back, when she was a little trouble with all the toonies I gave her a female staff asked if she wanted a $5 bill she would exchange it for her. I thought that was really considerate.   I recommend this restaurant and will personally come back."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, fast service, and great food! We come here often and they never disappoint.   They are very accommodating to bigger groups and the server remember our orders when we go!"}
{"text":"Visited here couple of times over the past couple of days.    Order # 521 combo platter of vermicelli, bbq chicken, spring rolls, and it comes with a packet of rice paper to dip and roll your own rolls which was pretty neat. Good dish to share and very reasonable cost too. $8  Thai tea -- interesting, pretty spicy, didn't like it but something different to try condensed milk at the bottom with spicy tea.  Singapore noodles - done alright - curry a little bit too powdery in texture, good sized shrimps.  Lemon chicken - lightly battered and not overly oily, very good taste with tangy house made lemon sauce.    Decor had now changed a bit,  photos of famous asian entertainer with perhaps the store manager (same guy in the photos)?   the Avril Lavinge poster replaced. damn :)  Menu very extensive, good quality food and selection, the service does tend to go downhill when it's busy. We had some requests for sauces that required asking couple times, same with the requesting the bill we needed to ask a couple of times for it too.  Anyways decent place to grab viet food if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and enjoyed the rare beef pho. The broth is free of impurities, like quality pho should be, and is quite flavourful. Friendly and attentive staff made it a pleasant experience. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"This is my regular Thai spot. I'm quite sure it's the most authentic in and around the area. Whenever I go in there are at least 4 tables sat, all with abundant and beautiful looking plates. They love to garnish with lots of Thai basil and bean sprouts.   The service is sweet, minimal and friendly but take out is great too. My personal favourite are the shrimp spring roller and the yellow curry.   The only reason I need to give it 4 stars, is because they do struggle with consistency from time to time."}
{"text":"Had the large Pho with rare beef. Portion was fine but was more like a medium. Broth was great and noodle were good too.   We shared spring rolls that were the thick kind and I found them to be a little bit greasy and had to much roll or batter for my liking. I prefer them to be skinnier and crispier.  Otherwise very good.  Thought it was interesting that it looked like an old Kelsey's location."}
{"text":"Do you have a deep longing for a delightful meal? One that will leave you full and happy? Then this is a great place to eat!  I've been coming here regularly for some time and the quality is consistent: the broths of the Pho are rich and delightful, the soups filled with depth and spice, and noodle dishes always cooked to perfection.   In terms of Vietnamese places in the area this has to be my favourite: the food is delicious, staff friendly (though sometimes understaffed during busy times of the day), and prices affordable."}
{"text":"We go here pretty often because it's cheap, tasty and filling. Service is pretty quick and they are always friendly. My only beef with them is the beef!! I've ordered beef and rice dishes a few times and it always tastes really different each time. Sometimes it's grilled perfectly and other times it has been really dry, like it had been sitting in a fridge for a couple of days and reheated. The chicken and pork with rice is good, and so is their pho. I quite like their broth. It doesn't make me feel bloated the next day after eating it.    We tried a Thai curry dish once and it wasn't good. I think their Vietnamese dishes are what should be eaten."}
{"text":"When Star King first opened, I thought to myself: \"Yes, finally a vietnamese place in midtown that's not \"asian fusion\"!\".  I have been to Star King at Warden and Steeles, and my chat with the management affirmed they are the same owners.  Yes, pricing is a bit higher than viet in scarborough, west north york, or downtown, but prime Yonge street rent is not cheap.  I reviewed their menu with Pho88 of Yonge/Sheppard and their prices are almost exactly the same.  They are also about 25-30% cheaper than Pho King Fabulous across the street.  Do not eat in, if you expect good service (this is not Riz).  The service is similar to any fast-paced viet place in the burbs and downtown.  Pho - decent, broth is not as spiced and aromatic as I like, but clean tasting, toppings very well prepared (tendon meltingly soft, brisket soft, rare is served rare, tripe clean), only herb offered is basil  Rice platters - ok, typical Spring Rolls - very overpriced at 5.50 for two. Bun - my favorite here, I prefer the chicken over the pork Combination Vermicelli - LARGE portion of bun, with additional veg Salted fish and chicken fried rice - surprisingly good and the ONLY place I can get it in 15 KM radius. Pad Thai/Curry - more fast food tomato pad thai, and not traditional, curries overly salty, stick with the viet food here  Takeout is efficient.  Items extremely well-packed."}
{"text":"The pho was pretty underwhelming at Star King. While the portions were generous and meat quality was above average, the broth was very oily. It is probably the oiliest pho soup base I have ever had. It was also salty and surprisingly bland. Compared to other places in Toronto, I would definitely rank their pho in the bottom-tier. I do realize that pho is a pretty personal thing, so who knows, maybe you'll like it.    However, the calamari that we ordered was pretty crispy and tasty. I would not come back for the pho, but perhaps I would come back to try other items on the menu.  As others have mentioned, the location of the restaurant makes it hard to find parking at times. Unlike most Vietnamese restaurants, the physical space is large and the seating is very comfortable."}
{"text":"When they first opened up, we were ecstatic. Not one place to get pho near Yonge and Eglinton before Star King. Our first visit was satisfactory, but every time we went back, we were a bit more disappointed than the previous visit. First, it was lukewarm broth, then not so fresh vegetables, then smelly meat, and finally they had no bean sprouts at the beginning of dinner time. Also every time we eat there, we get extremely thirsty afterwards. This is how you lose your customers over time: neglecting the little details."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. I love their food, especially their laksa and platters, and most of their servers are nice, except for one lady who never smiles and is rude at times. The restaurant smells a bit funky, but I still go sometimes for the food."}
{"text":"Very fresh and one of my favorite places to eat. It might be a little slow at lunch time but dinner and take out is fast. I usually don't rave about pho places but this one deserves it. It's also very clean as far as i could see:)"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favourite Vietnamese/Thai restaurant to eat at. It's very cheap and great portions. I got whenever I can and never do I get the same thing. I like to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Happy that a good Vietnamese place opened at Yonge and Eg!  Pho and vermicelli are both decent - good quantity, moderately priced.  Restaurant is clean, good service.  Have been there many times.  They also deliver - free of charge!"}
{"text":"I've been loving Pho in Toronto for decades and I've had the pleasure of trying many different places. As of 2016, Star King has won my #1 spot in Toronto. I have to admit that I was surprised by how good they are as they are way off the usual beaten Pho path and they are also a relatively new place. You'll find most people quoting other Pho restaurants such as Golden Turtle or Pho Hung as some of the best places in the city and while you would definitely be happy at the other places, Star King has upped their game. To get specific, the broth is top notch, but more importantly, I have never found a place that gives you more meat in the bowl than here and the service is quick and friendly as well. Prices are spot on as seems to be the standard everywhere in the city. I can't comment on their other dishes though.  I will still visit the other top places in Toronto but Star King has happily claimed my personal #1 spot for Pho."}
{"text":"I work near by and was very excited when star king opened. I have tried it about 5 times for lunch and I have to say I will not return at this point. The last time we went as a group of four, it took about 30 mins between when we asked for the bill to when we got it. The lady said oh I forgot when she finally brought it over after we had asked for the third time. The time before that, I ordered a small pho and it was more of a snack size, significantly smaller than what they served when they first opened. To sum it up, sadly for good pho you have to either go north on yonge or south to Chinatown."}
{"text":"I go here probably twice a month to get my pho fix when I'm in the area. The food itself is fresh and authentic. The portions are decent (especially when you consider the area) but the pho bowls are smaller than typical pho restaurants. (Sidenote: I wish they had bun bo hue but they don't...) I love pho and this pho place is definitely one of the better ones in the area.  That being said, service is super lacking. For small groups (2-4), it's tolerable. Often you just gotta go up to the (very busy) server in the back and just hand in your order or request tea/cutlery or get/pay your bill. Its definitely a mom and pop shop and the \"mom\" and the one other server do their best but it's really poor service. Otherwise it would be a solid 4. I highly do NOT suggest groups of 6+ come here for lunch on a weekday. You will be there for quite a while. Today two large groups came right I was seated and were seated promptly.  One group just started getting their orders served when my 4 top finished their meal.  This happened everytime to me as well when I went with large groups. I just only go now if it's 4 or less people.  Otherwise when it's not weekday lunchtime rush, it's a solid option for pho."}
{"text":"Glad to have a Vietnamese place in the neighborhood to satisfy my husbands cravings. The decor is pretty nice and it's a nice clean place for fast food.   My husband says the pho is pretty good, he being the pho-lover. Although the first time we came he made the mistake of ordering the small size. If you order the pho please order the regular or extra large size for a few bucks more, you will get at least 2-3x more noodles. The small was so small it seemed like a child's meal.   The deal seems to be the chicken and pork rice for only 8 dollars. Had sufficient meat and rice to fill me at least but might not be enough for the big appetites. I also tried the pad Thai and I thought it tasted too much like ketchup and had too little chicken.  Overall I thought the service was good and the prices were reasonable. We will definitely be back when we are too lazy too cook!"}
{"text":"The quality at this place keeps falling.  The first few times I went, it was about a 3 star place, then 2.5, and yesterday, a solid 2 and creeping lower.    The main culprit?  A pad thai that is becoming more and more an oily, bland, noddle stir-fry.  At least they're using pad thai noodles rather than Chinese ho fun like some other places I've been to.  Ick.  The pork and chicken chop with rice dish we had was a grade higher, though nothing super special.    Otherwise, the price is right, the service super fast and the decor amusing.  Lots of movie personality posters leftover from the old Kelsey's.  Really like that it's open late and always has plenty of room."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. Perhaps, I should give them one more try. The menu is super heavy on pork. The place is very small, and the service is somewhat slow. I had fish curry, and I felt spices almost overpowered taste of everything, but tom yum soup was very good. Not only orders do not arrive at the same time but my soup and curry arrived at the same time, and tables are pretty small to accommodate all of your order at the same time. I will try them one more time to see if the taste of curry is different, perhaps that was an off day for the kitchen :)"}
{"text":"My go to place in the area for a tasty bowl of pho in a very comfortable setting.   Pho is on par with nearby Pho 88 in Bamburgh Circle which can be very uncomfortable when busy.   Not so at Star King.   Nice, clean washrooms a definite plus."}
{"text":"Super long wait for food.  Arrived at noon got seated and food arrived at 1250pm. Wish they would warn us before we sat down. After we asked  they told us only 2 people working in the kitchen.  Alot of people are waiting to be seated too.  Don't come here if you can't wait for an hour for food."}
{"text":"Had a really horrible experience just recently. I have been to this place once before and it was good. I had the spring rolls with grilled beef and rice.  An hour after I ate there, I felt sick to my stomach and threw up.  I felt sick the whole night.  I love Vietnamese food a lot but i won't go back"}
{"text":"The service is horrible horrible horrible. I went for a few times, almost every time the place was packed so you can hear each other talking. And the servicing time is slow, beyond your imagination. I waited almost half an hour on a Monday lunch time even though the waiter \"promised\" 10 minutes.   And the food is not even worth the wait, it is very greasy with no green vegetables. I asked for cilantro one time cause I m a big fan, the server gave me 1 slice of cilantro about 3 centimetres long, seriously?????!!!!!!!!! The waiter looks really dumb to be honest, he does not prioritize.   The price is cheap, but the emotional torture makes the whole experience negative.   Will not go again."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been one of my favourite Vietnamese restaurants to go to (other is Xe Lua in Chinatown Toronto and Xe Lua in Scarborough) for the past few years ! Lovely ambiance, reasonable prices, and below average waiter service. My recommendation is to try their rice dishes and vermecelli dishes. The portions for both these dishes are enormous and well prepared to my satisfaction. Their spring rolls are emmaculate with just the right amount of crunch in each bite. They have a vast array of drinks to choose from and I would recommend their Red Bean, Grass Jello with Coconut Milk & Ice drink! Parking can possible be a pain , due to its location near the T&T Supermarket, but this restaurant will be worth the effort !"}
{"text":"I don't know how someone can give a 4 star? The beef is so rough and noodle are little. The soup quality is under average. The service was good for my 2 stars. Not a place for good soup."}
{"text":"This is my go to pho place in the area. It's a small Vietnamese Thai restaurant that has more than the standard items. In addition to Vietnamese standard spring rolls, salad rolls and pho soups, there are Thai appetizers, rice and noodle dishes. This restaurant is authentic and the food is fast and fresh. This time I got spring rolls, shrimp salad rolls, chicken pho, pho special. I also got the rice paper roll appetizer dish. Not a lot of Vietnamese restaurant carry this or you have to go to St Clair to get this special dish. There are Thai style high chairs for little ones and washrooms are clean. Parking can be hard to find in this area at Yonge and Eglinton. Have tried take out before as well and no issues. Pho tends to taste better dine in. Overall one of my favorites casual dining places in the area if I want to get a pho fix."}
{"text":"Great tasting Vietnamese food.  Pho was very good. Large menu with great selection. Neighborhood has lacked this type of cuisine until now. Very quick for take out.  Small restaurant makes it difficult to get a table for groups of 6 or more."}
{"text":"A solid 3.5 stars. The food here is awesome!! The service could however improve and it's not the servers, they are all very nice but I don't think they have enough to take care of busy lunch hours. Nevertheless, it's a great place in town: recommended for lunch.  Food: 3/5, the pad Thai is good!  The laksa was just ok.  Service: 2/5, just slow and you need to often get their attention.  Ambience: 3/5, great overall, some deco here and there and comfortable seating (cushions)   Price 4/5, about $10 per person"}
{"text":"Food was awful!  Everything is so bland.  Would not go back there again.  When it first opened, the quality of the food was quite decent.  I think it had gone downhill from then on.  The service and the food need a new change."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch with some work friends.  Waited 10 min to order and another 30 for the food then another 15 for the bill, paid $20 for a small lunch (cashew chicken - no rice or noodles included, 50% of the dish was some type of onion) with a fresh juice. Left hungry and annoyed."}
{"text":"Either they recognize familiar faces, or the servers check the yelp reviews... because service continues to get better after each time I come here. A heaping amount of pad thai, served on a platter, is good for two! Every time I order it, I can only finish half. It's v saucy, but not overwhelmingly saucy... I prefer the regular pad thai because it has a hint of ketchup to it (peep the pic I posted). If you ask the server for peanut sauce (peanut butter based), they charge $1.00 extra. I order the chicken pad thai, which comes with tofu; the fried tofu they serve on it is soaked in flavour (no longer crunchy, but not too hard to swallow)."}
{"text":"Been here twice so far and  I ordered a pad Thai and an XL tom yum chicken noodle soup. The portion is ok. Both comes in good sizes but the pad Thai was too soggy and the tom yum soup has too many tomatoes. The appys were ok. But if you know Thai food, this place is a definite disappointment ...."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for two more occasions after my initial visit and decided to revise up my rating to 4/5. It has markedly improve on food and speed of service.  Food (4/5): Tried their vermicelli and range of rice dishes must say that they've improved on balancing the taste. The ingredients and cooking are excellent as per my previous visit.  Speed / Service (4/5): Food takes about 10 minutes to prepare which is acceptable for a Viet restaurant and good enough for a normal lunch. Service is gracious and friendly as well."}
{"text":"Located at the corner of Warden & Steeles, this Viet/Thai restaurant is in place of what Kelsey's used to be. Most of the interior design remained the same, though there is a large crystal chandelier in the middle of the restaurant. The bar is no longer in use and mostly filled with Coca Cola bottles.   I have been here on several occasion on a late night dinner. I have tried the curry dishes and a combo platter.  The curry dishes either come with rice or a French baguette. The curry is nowhere near authentic to Thai, as it was most likely made Chinese style. Though the flavour was surprisingly good. I had 2 orders of rice just to finisht he curry.  The combo platter comes in different selections, but mine included rice paper, vermicelli, spring rolls, grilled chicken, and grilled pork meat balls. It was a large platter and it's more of a DIY Viet spring roll type of meal. It was too messy for me to actually enjoy the meal.   The prices are right on, quick service, and decent food. It's definitely an A-OK place for a decent Viet/Thai restaurant in the Scaborough area."}
{"text":"good price of Vienamese. pho is pretty good (enough beef) but the woman sever was unkind :-("}
{"text":"Identity crisis!! This place still feels and looks like Kelseys but its hard to imagine its a Vietnamese restaurant.  With random fixtures, and clutter along the bar with dirty and clean glasses all around it, this place was in desperate need of a clean up.  Pho Beef Noodles: 3/5 the usual like you would get at any PHO Vietnamese restaurant, the portion and price is bang on!  Chicken Pad Thai: 2/5, the chicken was very TRE TRE BLAND! there was absolutely no season, nor passion put into this cooking.  The pad thai sauce was more sour than sweet, and it seemed as if the noodles and pad thai sauce were mixed last minute.  The texture, and the freshness wasn't up to par.  You could tell the pad thai sauce was mixed in last minute before serving, as the noodles had a lot of left over sauce.   Spring Rolls: 4/5  The crunch, and melody of flavor hit the spot, and the size and price for this was worth it!   Overall the service was great! However if you're looking for portion and price without the quality  then this is your place! sorry guys...honesty goes a long way"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I thought the food was really good here, and we've been to a lot of pho places!! That is until we found multiple flies floating around in the soup. And I still paid the full price of the pho after it was barely touched/eaten.... Don't think I'll ever be coming back after that."}
{"text":"Just went for pho tonight - craving soup and spice to knock out a cold and this place hit the spot!  Fresh shrimp rolls, good fried spring rolls and the pho was excellent!  We all ordered the medium size and gobbled it right up.  Fresh sprouts, basil and lime wedges accompanied the soup (but did not make it into my photos, sorry!)  All the usual condiments were alongside the table to heat up the soup.  Food came out fast and super friendly service.  We will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"2.5/5 in general. Sorry it is just average in every way.   I've had their pho and fresh rolls, and I have to say it's very mediocre.  I was disappointed that the fresh roll didn't come with peanut dipping sauce, because usually other Vietnamese restaurant do offer those and they taste bomb. Also for the first time ever, pho didn't come with bean sprouts, one waitress simply said they ran out."}
{"text":"Ive never eaten in, but i regularly order delivery from star king. Its reliably high quality pho at good prices."}
{"text":"I was craving some pho and I googled the nearest pho restaurants and Star King was one of them. It was on a Tuesday between lunch and dinner time so it was just perfect, food came out quickly and my first experience here was great! Friendly staffs and broth wasn't greasy with good portion. Their location is pretty convenient as well, just past the Yonge & Eglinton centre. Would recommend and come back!"}
{"text":"For the white-washed Yonge & Eglington area, this is pretty much as good as you're going to get for Vietnamese.  But that's not really saying a whole lot as the only other Vietnamese place is across the street: Pho King Fabulous!  If the name alone doesn't make you cringe, in a time of desperation, I went into PKF to eat and there was a \"Keep Calm and Eat Pho\" poster.  I can sense your urge to open-hand slap someone right now...  Anyways, Star King definitely looks more legit and even smells like an actual Vietnamese restaurant.  I got my standard litmus house special (dac biet) pho and my buddy got a grilled pork chop and egg over broken rice.  My XL pho was pretty sparse on meat and I think I was paying more for extra noodles than anything.  The meatballs were tiny, not a lot of flank meat and I didn't notice any significant portions of tendon or tripe that most other dac biets have.  It is a big bowl -- but I don't think they scaled up the toppings as well.  However, the pho broth was pretty solid.  It's a lighter and more Northern Vietnam style - very passable.  My buddy enjoyed his grilled pork chop.  In this Asian food starved area, Star King is probably 4-stars.  But if you have access to a car and don't mind driving 15 minutes to Scarborough, there are much better options.  That said, Star King isn't bad as long as you keep your expectations reasonable."}
{"text":"Just went again today for lunch.  I was surprised that there were many customers.  I realized the reason when the food arrived: the portion was BIG - the protein, the carb.  No one in our party of 8 could finish their dishes.    The food tasted average.  The service speed was okay enough if the order was pho or vermicelli.  One person in our party ordered an eggplant stir fry, and it took half an hour to come.   With this big portion, I think Star King is okay for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is great ! I see a lot of mixed reviews on here but I think people forget where they are. Its so worth it especially for this price point. Really good portions here, I always leave full. Most of the food here is pretty true to what it should be. I will say its not the best Pho in town, but its a really good choice for a cheap eat at Yonge and Eglinton.  Pho, spring rolls, and vermicelli are all great choices. Especially vermicelli combination, where you get to wrap your own fresh rolls. Soups here are also so good! Tom yum and Curry Laksa. When you order take out, everything comes packed up really really well."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai and Vietnamese food, great atmosphere and super attentive and helpful staff. The prices are amazing too!!"}
{"text":"When you come to Star King, you really need to know what to order and what to stay away from.   1. Their mango salad is okay. It's loaded with julianned mango strips, red and green pepper strips, with a soy and sweet sauce, sprinkled with peanut bits. It's good yet swimming in sauce so it was a bit overboard. $6.   2. Vermicilli Combo - BBQ chicken and spring rolls. This is $8 and by far a great deal. It comes in a huge plate with lettuce, vermicilli, spring rolls, chicken, and a bag of rice papers. You are supposed to dip the rice papers into the bowl of warm water (to soften the paper) and then wrap the ingredients into the paper and roll it up. There's about 12 rice paper per combo? Huge portion for one person or share between two. Also comes with a nice dipping sauce. WORTH IT.   3. Beef Noodle Soup - good, just what you'd expect.   4. Pork Chops $7 Two juicy grilled pork chops with rice and dipping sauce. Delicious. Did I mention the pork chops were juicy? Mmmm though they were on the slim side.   5. Curry / Pad Suey - STAY AWAY FROM THESE. Watery curry, not creamy, limp pad suey that's overly sweet. Not authentic at all."}
{"text":"The food tasted pretty bland and crappy to be honest.  A lot of their menu is overpriced from the many Viet places I've tried. I felt sick afterwards too (I got BBQ Beef-Vermecelli-Spring Roll plate).  The guy working there kept watching me as I ate too, which was awkward as hell."}
{"text":"3.5/5!  I've been to this Vietnamese/Thai fusion restaurant three times in the last 1.5 years.  The menu is quite extensive, but also somewhat confusing for a first-timer because there are two pages for Vermicelli noodles (one that comes with rice paper and the portions are larger than the regular Vermicelli dishes).  I've ordered both in the past, and personally, I find that the regular-sized vermicelli dish is quite enough for me, and it's a few bucks cheaper too.  The food itself is great! I have only ordered the vermicelli dishes all three times.  I tend to order the vermicelli  with BBQ chicken, spring roll, and minced shrimp on sugar cane.  It's delicious and only costs $8! The spring rolls are great ($4 for two). Not chewy and very crunchy.  I usually order an extra side of spring rolls at my table because they're so tasty, but the vermicelli dish is filling enough on its own. Also, if anyone cares, the vermicelli noodles are the thicker kind, which I like (thick as spaghetti).  I've noticed that most Vietnamese restaurants these days have been using the really thin rice noodles, which isn't my fave.  The service quality is definitely lacking.  Most of the servers are not very alert and attentive to customers.  The atmosphere is also a bit different as the place used to be a Kelsey's.  So there's a Westernized-feel to the place. I'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"if you want to try bad attitude waiters added with bad food. you can go to this place. we ordered a mixed food from chinese/vietnamese and thai, they all taste terrible.  I asked for pad ka prau (basil chicken). they said, pad ka prau don't have.  basil chicken have. (with attitude .. go figure) a couple of our food were not event coming (we order appetizers) 1 out of 3. the meal came before the appetizer and it was COLD. then I heard the next table, were arguing about their food to the waiter. (lol) they said in quote \"if we give you wrong order, we will fix it\", but if you give us a wrong order, you have to take it."}
{"text":"A bit hit and miss for me.  Service isn't great, not particularly friendly.  I have some great meals and some that have been pretty average.  Overall food is somewhere between ok and good but you get very generous servings. Good value.  I've had the Thai Curries and the BBQ Chicken with shredded pork.   I found the fried rice dishes a bit bland."}
{"text":"Occasionally the quality is a miss but usually it is good. And for the price it is a very good option in the neighbour."}
{"text":"3.5 stars based on 2 visits past 9:30pm.  Happy to have a clean Vietnamese restaurant in the neighbourhood! Waitress was really nice, explaining dishes to those unfamiliar with the cuisine. Also, she provided separate bills without a fuss (6 of us the first time and 10 the second.)  Orders did not arrive at the same time, but we did not have that expectation and were not bothered by it, perhaps because we were chatting and/or our tea and water was refilled while we were waiting.  I enjoyed the very reasonably priced DIY rice wraps, starting at $10 for 1 meat and a spring roll. Everyone enjoyed their meals and would return. Hopefully, Star King will stay clean, continue serving good food and get their liquor license."}
{"text":"Can't say they have the best Pho in the city, but probably the best one in the Yonge and Eglinton neighbourhood. Their cold shrimp rolls are a bit stingy on shrimp, but their spring rolls are on point. Service is always great and the interior decor doesn't look like your typical dingy hole in the wall spot in Chinatown."}
{"text":"I have dined at Star King about 4 or 5 times since it's opened and have always been pleased with the experience. The wait staff are friendly and the food is tasty and reasonably priced. Usually I get the beef ball and rare beef pho and a side of spring rolls. It's nice to have a non-middle-of-the-road Italian resto option at Yonge & Eglinton!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are regular customers here, sadly.  I used to work at a pho restaurant and I cringe at how poor and slow the service is here. Don't even get me started on how it took over 30 mins to get 2 bowls of pho. How the servers are, can only tell me what it must be like in the kitchen. If you can get past the servers looking like they hate their job, their life, talking to a wall, I recommend if you're in the Yonge/Eglinton area."}
{"text":"I came here for Sunday dinner. Star King is a crowded tastefully decorated restaurant near Yonge and Eglinton. The service was brisk but efficient. I got my food very quickly.  I ordered the extra large rice noodle soup with rare beef, beef tripe, and beef tendon. The bowl of soup was much larger than I expected. It was very good and the broth was delicious.  Would I go back? Yes. You get a lot of delicious food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Average for pho. Deep fried spring rolls were a little odd tasting. Enjoyed the meal but for pho, there are tastier spots around."}
{"text":"Recently opened up in the neighborhood, it's a tasty addition for the fast lunch crowd to be able to have ok viet food, in a nice enough environment. Prices are great and worth the food. Is it the best? Definitely not - but they do a pretty good job."}
{"text":"I had the Laksa, it was good and the small size was still a good portion.  It's lacking in presentation, but the flavours are still all there.  The restaurant smelled like stale bales of rice, which was a bit off putting, and being part Thai, I would have wanted to smell the flavourful spices and herbs traditionally used.  It was agood for a quick bite, service was polite and prompt, but I've had better Vietnamese and Thai food elsewhwre."}
{"text":"Typical pho place but with way nicer decor than the others. I got a small pho, which probably wont make you too full for a meal but rather a large sized mid-afternoon snack size. I also ordered the thai iced tea with milk - not bad but just a little pricey for $3.50.. My friend got the thai iced tea with lime which was the same price but not as worth it imo since it really is just typical iced tea with a wedge of lime (nothing too special)."}
{"text":"As usual, I walked around this area trying to find a place for lunch ( I work in this area) and bumped into Star King. It was on a hot, sunny day but I decided to give it a try.   Pho was decent. The broth was actually good and flavourful compare to some other Vietnamese restaurant I've been to. However, the amount of beef and tripe were so little! And they only gave me one piece of tendon! I guess that's all I could get for a small size.   I also tried many other dishes. The vermicelli wasn't right. They used the noodle which us Vietnamese mostly put in soup like Bun Bo Hue (Spicy Beef Noodle Soup - Hue Style) . For vermicelli dishes, they should use the skinny rice noodle.    Their bbq chicken is good but their pork chop is meh. I ordered pork chop and it was super dry. I also tried the yellow curry before and the broth was too sweet for me. The chicken satay and pork satay I had today were both dry. But their peanut sauce was the bomb. I love the sauce.  The decoration is pretty much random. It's like a mixed of Vietnamese and Thai in such a small restaurant. Their dim lights give me a dizzy and it's a bit suffocated. However, the restaurant is very clean.  The staffs are friendly and fast. But the food takes forever to come even when the restaurant isn't that busy.  Good thing, they just renew their menu and the pricing is reasonable now for some items. Thai Iced Tea with Condense Milk is $3 now, instead of $3.5 and they also reduce the price for milkshake.   I will always come here when I want Pho while working in this area. Not the best authentic Pho but the best Yonge & Eglinton can offer."}
{"text":"Really disappointing.  Had the vermicelli with pork and spring roll ... on the plus side, it's HuGE.  I mean, gigantic.  However, the noodles are too thick, more like spaghetti than vermicelli.  Plus, the orange sauce that came with it smelled like feet.  There was something seriously wrong with it.  I've had this dish many, many times in Vietnamese restaurants and that was not the right smell at all.  Massively disappointed because I'd love to have some great pho around Eglinton."}
{"text":"Tried Grilled Shrimp Skewers with Peanut Sauce and Thai Curry Laksa. I wouldn't order the skewers again. Shrimps were small, bland and dry. On the other hand, Thai Curry Laksa was delicious. Rich and creamy flavour yummy goodness. They also accommodated our request to have rice noodles instead of transparent noodles for Seafood Pho. Forget the atmosphere and service, in terms of food, this restaurant is one of better places for Vietnamese cuisine in the area."}
{"text":"I was a little sketched out by the previous reviews of this place ... & I wished I listened.   Coming in the tables were more than half empty at 6PM - uh oh.  We seated ourselves and a waiter came over with menus.  The menu is very, very, very extensive.  We ordered the BBQ pork and beef vermicelli, the satay beef pho, the chicken pho, spring rolls, and a thai iced tea with condensed milk.  The vermicelli was okie dokes - nothing to brag about but a decent meal overall. The satay pho looked sooo red and spicy and although it stung my taste buds a bit ... it's flavour was very superficial and I felt like they used packaged seasoning for the soup base ): My friend had the chicken pho and she doused it in hotsauce before I had the chance to taste the original flavour ): I understand that although we got small phos ... the portions were minuscule. I don't eat a lot in general but I was still ready for some more after I finished my bowl. The deep fried spring rolls were no good in terms of flavour and crispiness.  I expect my spring rolls to be crisp and fresh whereas theirs were chewy and tasted a little stale fml. The thai iced tea tasted sooo bland.   I didn't expect a lot out of this place but it did not meet expectations whatsoever.  The worst part of it was the waiters kept on coming over to ask us if we were finished and tried taking my friend's bowl of pho.  There were like 3 tables in the restaurant that were filled and it was nowhere near closing time. CHILL! Let her finish eating."}
{"text":"Star King Viet Thai Cuisine is located at the corner of Warden and Steeles across from T&T Supermarket.  I saw an ad  in the Chinese magazine saying that they are under the same parent company as of Xe Lua. I don't know if it is good or bad news... However, I decide to give it a try!  Star King location used to be a Kelsey. They kept most of the decoration, the bar, the booth and stained glass panels. The only thing they did to the restaurant was taking down all the hollywood posters, change the lighting (brighter and with a crystal chandelier in the middle).   The prices are comparable to Xe Lua, I order a Large Pho with raw beef and tripes ($6.00). The soup was steaming hot. The broth tasted a little too salty for my taste and the noodle is the dried type. Usually I don't like the dried type but they did do a good job and take out that funny taste in the dry noodles.   However, I did enjoy my pho, especially on a cold windy winter day! The Large pho came in a big bowel with a lot of soup but not too many noodles or meat.. I was still a little hungry after eating that.  The seatings are really comfy and you never close to your neighbours. I do like the private booths!  They really have to cut out the elevator music!! It is not even on a good sound system, sounded like something from an AM radio.. why they bother I don't know!  The menu does have a lot of different choices.  NO lunch Specials!!!  They accepts VISA."}
{"text":"I've only had the pho here and what can I say? Pho is pho just about anywhere you go. Overall, the service was what you would expect for a little informal place like this. Just very casual and not over the top at all. Atmosphere was kind of eclectic and interesting. Overall, I'd say it's a good place to go to grab a good bowl of pho after a long day. No complaints."}
{"text":"I would say it's more of an 3.5 rating. The place is small and quaint. Food was better than expected.  I had ... Mango salad - yummy! Tom Young soup - yum! Pai Thai - too sweet but good  Prices were fair considering the location.   Location is a five minute walk from Eglinton Station.  An update in the restaurant would be helpful.    Satisfied my craving."}
{"text":"I figured pho would be the fasted option for a quick bite after the movies. Wrong.  The table remained empty 30 minutes after ordering a small and a medium pho. Disappointing considering it's 9pm on a Wednesday and way past normal dinner rush hour."}
{"text":"I came to the restaurant with low expectations, just so I won't feel too bad coming out.  I came out not feeling too bad because it was as I expected.  Horrendously slow service.  The waitresses just lounge about and it's hard to get a hold of them.  At least they refill the teas more regularly.  Food was pretty lousy.  I had the cashew chicken.  The cashews were the only things edible on that.  The chicken they used tasted like it came from Foody Mart as it was of such low quality.  We had beef brisket noodles in yellow sauce and that was pretty much lousy as well.  The only thing that was remotely edible was the skewered chicken with peanut sauce.    I basically took the sauce and mixed it with the beef brisket noodles to make it close to edible.  The ambiance may be nice and clean, but seriously the food and service quality was so below restaurants of this class I just had to give it 1-star rating.  I can't even justify it having more than that."}
{"text":"I do really enjoy this restaurant. They have amazing beef pho! 110 is always my order. I do highly recommend to order their Thai ice tea. I could have 10 glass in one sitting! Literally"}
