{"text":"I must say I was a bit skeptical at first but seemed like a cool concept. My coworkers and I each got a different potato. I actually did the elote fries. They were all amazing with great flavor! We also did the BBQ and philly cheese potato. Now, we usually try to make it over next door to our office once a week when they are in the area!"}

{"text":"Your truck parked outside my office today. Within 15 minuets you had a line. You handled the crowd like a pro.  Your food top notch. When things got long and people just standing around you stayed with the updates. Nice job hope you slide through again. Try the buffalo chicken baked potato. Just the right amount of heat."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! Both the food and the service!! Ask for the secret menu potato skins best ever!!!!"}
{"text":"I was super excited for my apple bacon sweet potato fries! The way the menu described them made them sound super heavenly. However upon receiving my order, I was rather disappointed? Most of the fries were burnt looking and worse, super dry inside. They tasted bland and not at all worth it, despite being buried under candied bacon and sweet diced apples. The toppings themselves were delicious and delightful but if a truck can't give that same love to the star ingredient? Kind of a downer. ;( Can't say I'd come back or recommend this truck to friends."}
{"text":"The best baked potato I've had in a long time.  I had the sundried tomato, spinach, mushroom and feta cheese. Minus feta(I don't like it), added cheddar and carne asada. Primo! I can't wait to try others."}

{"text":"We had the carne asada potato and a buffalo chicken potato. So yummy! Just enough of everything and I don't feel like a glazed donut. Fresh and perfect!!"}

{"text":"This was the food truck tonight at Tenaya Creek Brewery. The service was awesome and the food.....amazing. Had the bbq beef potato and the carne asada potato. Both were excellent and the potatoes were done to perfection. So many interesting combinations on the menu I can't wait to try more. Next time I'm definitely going for the Ruben potato. Keep doing what you're doing and we will keep coming back for more."}
