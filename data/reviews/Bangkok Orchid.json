{"text":"This restaurant has been around for almost a decade! Used to be my favorite place but they changed the chef few years ago and food are not tasting the same authenticity. Nowadays I hang out at Thai House on Maryland Pkwy & Silverado. They have very authentic flavor. Try their Eggplant (Stir fried with chicken, onion and peppers) and Papaya Salad and of course Fish Cakes. Dont forget your Iced Thai Tea. Sawadee...."}
{"text":"I like this place,great food,great service,dont know why people complain about the service and size of the food ,we will be back"}
{"text":"My old boss had been telling me about this place for years.  We came in for the lunch special.  $4.99 plus $1.95 for the soda worked out to an even $7.50 with tax.  I think this runs 11:00-3:30.  Something to note would be that 2 for 1 beers start at 3:00 so you've got a nice little 1/2 hour bargain overlap!  The lunch special stars with soup and then a bento box that includes a wonton, entree, sticky rice (ours was formed into the shape of a heart, how touching) green salad with a ranch like dressing, and some sweet and sour sauce.  I had the spicy chili mint chicken, level 7.  I really enjoyed this however when I go back I'll probably go for a 9 or 10.  GF had some sort of sweet and sour chicken, it was also good.  Service was prompt and our sodas never got empty.    Next time I find myself at Sunset and Sunset, I will definitely hit up the B.O!"}
{"text":"Stopped and and had dinner around 5pm. I got the Chicken Pad Thai which wasn't bad but not as spicy as I requested. My girlfriend got the orange chicken. It was terrible, there was barely any sauce and the chicken was cold. The chicken appeared to be breaded with only what I can describe as, overcooked deep-fried funnel cake batter. On the inside, once we were able to bite thru the piece of chicken, we found most of the pieces of chicken did not have any chicken inside. For dessert we were given two small bowls of jello. We politely declined but were still served the bowls. I would not recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"So good. One of the few places to get spicy where it isn't just chili oil. Love this place."}
{"text":"Henderson  Just tried two dishes. They were subpar. Nice people but the food was simple. They played same song over and over again, driving me nuts!"}
{"text":"Just returned here with the Hubby. The kids and l liked it so much, we thought he should try it too. The food was just as good this time as last and the staff was still very friendly.  Love this place, if we lived here we would probably be in here every week. As it is, visiting Vegas for a week, and we came here twice because we liked it so much. We hope to return to Vegas in the future, if we do, we hope this place is still here. Do yourself and your wallet a favor and visit here."}
{"text":"I was in town and craving Thai so after a look around I settled here. I was greeted warmly upon entry by a hostess who was clearly speaking with a regular and happy to have me there. Generic comfortable Thai atmosphere. 1st class spicy tom yum soup w shrimp. I ordered 7-stars and my lips still are warm. Fantastic broth and nice minty-basil finish. The soup was 5-star. I asked my hostess-waitress for spicy basil beef and it was a solid 4-stars. I've had better but it was very good. I'd definitely come back and it seemed like a Thai home away fr"}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall type of place. Doesn't stop the food from being ON FLEEK. Come here when I am craving hot egg drop soup that's to die for and awesome pad Thai . And the crab rangoons are bomb.com !!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch order for to go. took over 20 minutes for chicken salad lunch special. no customer was there. then finally they brought out but no apologized or nothing... pretty rude and lunch time during work is very limited.... I don't think I can recommend to nobody like this type of services...."}
{"text":"Their chicken curry is so-so (a bit bland, even with a high spice level) and their crab rangoon is just okay. I highly recommend their spicy chili mint chicken or their larb salad - both were excellent. They have a large vegetarian menu, which is great for those who want more veggie options."}
{"text":"Everything is made special at this place. We love the crab rangoons, chicken satay, and the pad Thai. Me and my family love eating here! I'm waiting on an order as we speak :)  The service has always been really good. The prices are relative to the quality; the quality is really good!  Lunch specials are really good too!"}
{"text":"Dropped by here for lunch after church. We had barbecue chicken and garlic chicken which are so tasty.  B and her sister who co owns the place gave us free fried chicken and appetizer. This place is awesome."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the area. Very authentic and thick Thai atmosphere. We travelled from Southern California and looked for Asian food all the way, completely satisfied with the choice."}
{"text":"This place seems to have been here since I was a little kid and I hadn't been there until last month.  Service left a little to be desired in terms of speed but the waitress was very nice.  Decor was what you would expect, Tacky, with tons of faux foliage.  I liked the food. Didn't love it, but liked it. I've had a better pad thai in my day but for the price and serving size. I would go back. The best part of the meal was the hot and sour soup!"}
{"text":"Their Thai Iced Tea has a cinnamon flavor to it that is just AWESOME!!!  Fast and very reasonably priced.  Lots of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! The have Great lunch specials too!!  No complaints on the food here! Service is friendly too.  There lunch special is a great deal. You get soup and salad, egg roll, rice, fruit, and the main dish you choose.  I love their  beef pad se ew (sp?)  The decor needs to be renovated!"}
{"text":"Not going to lie, not big on Thai or Chinese food, but I was with others who chose the place and tagged along. I am always good with fried rice, love that stuff, but this kind was not great. The chicken was dry, no egg in it really, and overloaded with onions and scallions that those flavors just kind of took over.   Others may enjoy, but if you like fried rice do not waste your taste buds on this one.   In the end the service was good. The family there was really nice and thoughtful and they do have specials, happy hour, and I guess karaoke on some night of the week.   Never hurts to try."}
{"text":"Bangkok Orchid Thai - Chinese Food is one of my favorite restaurants. Their price is reasonable, the food tastes great, very nice presentation, clean, quiet and warm atmosphere."}
{"text":"Restaurant is cute.. Service is good... Food is average but the  combination fried rice was not good at all. All I could taste is old chicken and egg.  Not coming back"}
{"text":"I love this place. I lived in Thailand and I know my Thai food and this is worth a visit. My favorite is their chicken with mint, papaya salad and green curry. My daughter loves their satay chicken. Aroy Mahk ! Friendly staff"}
{"text":"Incredibly good and friendly service!! I was greeted by Chulie the server. I ordered the red pork curry to take out. Chulie suggested the dish as it was my first time eating here. I was offered water while I waited which is rare and exceeded my expectation for awesome customer service.  The food came out quick and it tasted delicious. The curry was the right amount of spicy and sweet. The vegetables tasted super fresh and the meat was tender and soft. Im a big fan of spicy and I can handle a lot, but this curry definitely pushed the limit which I was surprised yet addicted.  Awesome place, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE! Not only are the prices beyond reasonable.... but the food is on point! Fresh, HOT, crispy, light! Everything you would expect from Asian cuisine. HMMMM always the hole in the walls lol! EXTRA... my son insisted on having the coconut ice cream and I ended up digging in myself! It was the real deal! I'm not impressed easily...just saying. GO GO GO HERE TO EAT! BTW my son also wanted to compliment the chiefs and literally 2 little old ladies walked out! Lol! Epic!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for the lunch special.  I ordered the Chili Mint Rice Noodles (heat level 5), and my husband ordered the Yellow Curry (heat level 4).  Both dishes were served \"bento box style,\" and included rice, salad, egg roll and two wedges of orange.  The soup of the day was a vegetable soup (and tasty).  Both of our entrees were tasty but mine was not as spicy as expected.  Additionally, the portions were pretty small (probably not more than 2 oz. of protein in either dish).   Our biggest disappointments were the egg rolls (which were swimming in a sweet and sour sauce and soggy), and the salad (which was swimming in ranch dressing).  Ranch dressing in a Thai restaurant?  Really?  Had we been told how the specials were served, we would have ordered a la carte and shared soup and one entree."}
{"text":"This is the go-to spot when my husband and I are craving Thai and want to stay in the neighborhood. They are always friendly, quick and good at take-out. The take-out in our experience is always very fair priced and fast.   As far as the prices go, it's very reasonable for the quality. None of that fakey, plastic-y stuff that you often find at asian-fusion restaurants.  If you're dining in, it's a clean place with great options. (Also, good dessert which is important!) :) Often, even on busy weekend nights, the chef - which I believe is the matriarch of the family - comes out and asks you how your food is. She is the sweetest little Thai lady and you don't get that hospitality at restaurants any more. They don't pretend to have Michelin stars, but they are very good whether you are dining in or out! Highly recommend.  Try the yellow curry and egg rolls!"}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed this place. Really nice people run the place and it's relatively inexpensive. I had the pad see ew, the mint chicken and the tom yum soup. Their soup is probably the best tom yum I have had in town."}
{"text":"Always a pleasure coming here! Chule our sweet & polite young waitress is always attentive with a smile!  Portions  are good as well!  The owner/chef often comes out to check on everything as well .  Highly recommend! Been coming here for 10 years!"}
{"text":"My husband & I happened upon this little mom-n-pop restaurant after a movie. We were pleasantly surprised at how delicious everything tasted.  All of the food was freshly prepared and flavorful. The portions were generous for the price point. We had the Singapore beef noodle and Sweet & Sour pork lunch specials, Crab Ragoon, Chicken Satay, and 2 Tai Teas for lest than $40 even after tip."}
{"text":"My first time here! Very happy with the food.  Clean, quick and delicious. Definitely will be back and let my friends, co-workers know about this place!"}
{"text":"If you don't know what Thai food tastes like, you just won't know what you're missing. This is definitely NOT a real Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Me and the fam came in during lunch time so it was pretty quiet.  The food was very flavorful and the service friendly.  We ordered a few lunch specials: The Beef Chow Mein, Orange Chicken, and Mongolian Beef along with the Chicken Satay w/peanut sauce.  Everything came out pretty tasty except for one minor thing, there were literally only about four (4) little pieces of beef that came with the Mongolian dish.  But besides that, we were satisfied."}
{"text":"This restaurant I have been going to forever. They are very friendly to me. Their portion sizes are decent and so are the prices. It's a small place but if you like thai food I suggest you go. They have good lunch specials also."}
{"text":"I'm new to the area and found this restaurant in Yelp. Prices are reasonable and the lady who helped me provides excellent customer service. While waiting for my to go order she offered me soup to eat while I waited. I ordered cashew nut chicken. No complaints. I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I ordered padthai for lunch.  It was dry, sticky, and they forgot to put eggs and peanuts in it.  Only the owner speaks and understands English well. Owner offered to add eggs but I had no time to wait again.  This place used to be really good but seems like the cook has changed.  The food quality has decline drastically. This is the 3nd time they made a mistake in my order.  So this will be last time I will be coming here again."}
{"text":"I've ordered here a couple times and today was the day that sealed their fate. Horrible service. I was hung up on 3 times and never given a clear answer. I will not be coming here ever again."}
{"text":"Nice little place. Food is good and fairly close to street style food in Thailand. Service is friendly. The decor is a bit 1980's but if you can overlook that its fine."}
{"text":"So we tried this place 6 months or so ago for dinner. It was probably 4 stars then. We tried it today for lunch and it was awful. We got three lunch specials and a dinner panang curry. Not only were the portions super small but the flavor was bland and boring. The lunches came with \"fried rice\" that was basically dried yellow rice. There was nothing \"fried rice\" about it. It was terrible. The lunches also came with a \"house salad\" which was basically iceberg lettuce with a yucky creamy dressing. The Yellow curry lunch looked really green, not yellow, and the chicken was very dry. The curry itself was bland, I don't get it spicy so I can experience the other flavors that are supposed to be in yellow curry- turmeric, ginger, lemon grass, you know good stuff, but this curry was just so tasteless. We also got a pad Thai lunch- it tasted like it came a box. It lacked sauce and crushed peanuts. I guess I should say it had a minimal amount of sauce. And again it was just very bland. We also got a mint chili chicken lunch- pure salt, no flavor. Where was the mint?!? The panang curry was again bland, and had huge chunks of cabbage in it and the pieces of chicken were very dry, again. So disappointed.  We will not be returning, but going down the road to another Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food,good prices,great service,clean place and they have the beast Thai tea(my favorite)"}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place 7 years ago and it was the best authentic Thai food ever.    Now after returning to town after 7 years I tried the pad thai, finger egg rolls, soup and Thai tea.   The pad thai is soggy and too sweet.  The Thai tea was a little more watered down than most and the egg rolls are much smaller.   The soup was way too salty.  The atmosphere has changed and everything has more of a Hawaiian feel.     I love Vegas and wish I never left,  it breaks my heart to see all of my favorite places fall apart.   I read a review from a critic that said the kitchen works magic.   In guessing the trick was that the chef disappeared or this magic show is dark on Sundays."}
{"text":"I came back here two other times.  The first, I tried the BBQ chicken.  It was okay...I didn't really like the flavor and the portion was really sad.  I would give that experience two stars.  The second time, I tried the deep-fried chicken.  It tastes exactly as it sounds...yummy and crunchy, and nothing at all like Chinese food.  I requested that they give me the strawberry dipping sauce (the choices were plum or ranch, but they were accommodating) since I really enjoyed the strawberry chicken the first time around.  It was scrumptious and delicious!  Definite 4 star quality.  But all my experiences unfortunately average out to only three.  Definitely try the strawberry chicken or deep-fried chicken if you get the chance.  You're not going to leave full (if you get the lunch portions), but you will leave happy.*  *Not guaranteed that you will leave happy"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and everything was good! Service is excellent! Coconut soup, beef salad, chicken salad, fish cake appetizer, shrimp cakes, Thai iced tea, coffee iced tea and for dessert gotta get the sticky rice with mango! Must try!!! The best Thai restaurant since 2000!!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent here.  We had chicken wonton soup, mint fried rice, Mongolian beef, and sweet and sour chicken.  Each dish was amazing and the service was great.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"1. Was not welcomed upon arrival 2. Server was bland.....borderline rude 3. Asked for brown rice, and received white rice.  4. The size of the Tom Yum soup for Two looked like a small soup bowl..... 5. The curry had little flavor and was runny 6. The manager said that there would be no bill - I mentioned that I did not complain for that reason. The bill was brought....in full.   A totally disastrous experience - will NEVER return."}
{"text":"The food I tried was beef salad and it taste very good. My mom ordered the Pad See EUW Beef is so delicious and also the pad see euw chicken. The Thai tea is yummy during this hot days in Vegas. Bangkok Orchid also have the sweet  rice with mango is so good."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem for Thai food in the Henderson area. From the exterior it's not a fancy place but it has quality food, so don't judge a book by its cover :) I've been to this place 3 times now and every time it's been delicious. I always order Pad Thai chicken and Tom Kha Gai soup. The only complaint is that their 5 on the scale of spiciness is not that spicy! So you have room to explore or just order a side dish of chillies. Happy eating my friends!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! I will repeat soon, even though it's located far from my place."}
{"text":"I come here every time I'm in town. I feel like it is a hidden gem in Henderson. Today was the first time I've been here for lunch and wasn't disappointed. They have good lunch specials. You get a lot for the price: soup of the day, salad, entree, fruit, meat patty. It all comes in a bento box minus the soup .. cute. The only downside was that I ordered a 7/10 spicy level and it was like a 3. So if you like spicy go high."}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise to stumble upon this Gem of a restaurant.  When in Las Vegas, one thinks of the big casinos and fancy restaurants. I had a friend tell me 35 years ago...the real Las Vegas isn't on the strip...venture out. That advice still rings true today...  This restaurant is perhaps one of many Thai restaurants in the area, but this is a real gem...family owned small business with roots from Thailand...  They have a quite diverse list of menu items...certainly there is something for just about everyone. Tonight I needed some good hot soup and perhaps a small something...I chose the Tum Yum Goong Soup and Chicken Larb...my goidness, all the flavors...remarkable.  Experience something wonderful, off and away from the strip...authentic Thai, from a Thai family...doing what they love doing...sharing culinary masterpieces...!!!"}
{"text":"I personally think this place is too expensive for small servings of food. The food in general is okay, I've had better. Eating in person is awkward especially if you're not Caucasian - my boyfriend and I ate there and we were being watched the whole time while eating there. Every time the waitress went back to the kitchen the guy would come out in front and just stand there. I order a Thai Salad and it was sloppy done, lettuce was in huge pieces (barley cut), peanut sauce was basically water sauce. I asked for a Fried Banana Ice cream which I had order before (at a different place) and they tried to pull a fast one by just bring me out breaded bananas...WITHOUT THE ICE CREAM! I confronted the waitress and she chocked and came up with a lame excuse \"I thought you didn't want Ice Cream'? Wow! Worse experience ever, my  boyfriend felt discriminated against since we were young and not Asian nor Caucasian. I really felt they must have thought it was our first time eating Thai food in general and wanted to just take advantage of us. Either way, in there menu the FBI picture menu even as the Ice cream clearly on top. I wouldn't eat there again and I wouldn't recommend anyone eating there either. I personally like Thai-To-go on Desert Inn there food is bombilicious and the staff there are super friendly and comforting. NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"This was pretty good! We got delivery from Orchid Garden on Sunday. The lunch specials are also offered on weekends, which is great! They also have a very extensive menu and everything looked pretty reasonably priced.  I got the lemon chicken lunch special, which was a good amount of food for under $6. Delivery won't include the soup, but it had the entree, rice, and a small salad.   Everything tasted good and they were completely accurate about the estimated delivery time, which made me very happy!"}
{"text":"A quart of chicken noodle soup: $8.95  A quart of Tom Ka Gai (coconut chicken soup): $10.95  That's pretty darn pricey. They do have a $5.95 lunch special, so the prices vary quite a bit.  I had a lunch special; the soup of the day was egg drop soup but would be best described as corn starch pudding.  Lunch comes on a nice tray with compartments; you get an egg roll about the size of your pinky, yellow rice in the shape of a heart, iceberg lettuce with house dressing (which was pretty good dressing) and I had chicken with broccoli. The chicken with broccoli was floating in a dull watery sauce, very sad.  Besides the house dressing everything was quite bland. I brought Tom Ka Gai home for my cold-beset wife and we've both had waaaaay better.  Ping Pong won't disappoint you if you want decent Thai food and it's not that far away."}
{"text":"I've eaten inside the restaurant many times and have ordered from them once. I really like getting the Tom Yum Kai, it's got a great blend of tang from the vinegar, heat from chiles and sweetness with the mellow protein note of chicken and chewy mushrooms. It was the first thai food I tried years and years ago and remains a favorite. The curry is good as well, though we always want it to be spicier. It's fun to eat in the restaurant as the soups are served crackling and hot on a clay pot burner. The girl I spoke with while ordering got my address wrong but the driver called to verify and all was corrected. Food is yummy and portions and good. The large size of the soup and the chicken curry was enough to feed 3 hungry people. I'm looking forward to trying out their lunch menus and sampling some of the other items :}"}
{"text":"Great place to grab lunch! Good food, great service and really clean!  Lunch special is only $5.95 and the portions are great! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"My first impression when entering the restaurant is that the decor is beyond cheesy and dated. The server  we had was very nice and very accommodating. I'm a little spoiled and picky when it comes to Thai food, due to the fact that I live Thailand and my wife is Thai, so I know what to expect when it comes to basic Thai food and I'm sorry to say this place did not not deliver my expectations.  Anyhow, I had the pad see ew and green curry chicken.  The pad see eww noodles were completely wrong.  They use a chow fun noodle similar to the ones at a Chinese restaurant.  The curry was ok in flavor, even though I feel it lack coconut milk.  Both meals came with a funny red tasting fried rice that tasted sweet and a small vegetable egg roll which is similar to the one from Panda Express.  Bottomline, they place will work for most people who wants inexpensive below average Thai food, but for those who experience real Thai food and understand the pallet of Thai flavored will find orchid Bangkok to be very disappointing."}
{"text":"Last night me and a friend came in, great service. Within an hour I had gotten sick. My friend has been sick all day with fever ,chills and stomach issues. Had  soup and a chicken curry dish , along with Thai tea."}
{"text":"Seven of us at work today each ordered from their lunch menu for pick-up. Total came to $32, not bad at all.  No one was disappointed. But no one was blown away either. Overall good. I thought the quality was good...maybe a few too many potatoes in the yellow curry...I'd rather have none.    They do not accept American Express."}
{"text":"The lunch pad Thai wad a lot of food for a good price, and the service was quick and convenient"}
{"text":"Went for lunch recently. The appetizers were good, but the main course was terrible. The beef broccoli was extremely bland and thee pad Thai was simply disgusting. There are several other Chinese and Thai places in Henderson that are far better."}
{"text":"My preferred Thai place was closed, and I used to come here so I tried it. Great lunch specials, very good value. Soup, egg roll, salad, orange slices, rice, and entree. The fried rice is great. Pad see-ew, pad Thai, green curry, all very good. Again, very good lunch value."}
{"text":"Please take into consideration that this happened a couple years ago and I'm catching up on reviews (new to yelp)!! My family and I use to love this Thai place until one day we ordered soup and there was a roach in it.  Needless to say we never went back and every time we pass this place we make a joke about the extra protein in the soup. I hope that they haven't had that issue again. But we will not revisit to find out."}
{"text":"I have been coming here on and off for years, however this time was different. Sitting along the wall in a booth, I look up to the window with some advertising on the other side of the window, and between the window and the paper add were several dead cockroaches, plus all the babies...how nice, while your trying to dine. Which only led me to believe these bugs have the run of the place after closing. NO thanks, switched seats, but was still very uncomfortable........the owner was not there and the cook came out to look at the situation.......we had barbecue  chicken ...thai style very tough couldn't even chew, must have been an old chicken, hardly touched it. Tom Ka Kai soup, no flavor, well you get the message. We will not be back..........$30 wasted."}
{"text":"Bad service and cold food. I really liked it, but today it was definitely a huge miss. They served me cold yellow rice and when I asked can I please get some warm she said she would be right back. When she gets back to the table she tells me that they are now out of yellow rice but she can heat it in the microwave for me..... Didn't offer anything else and walked away. After that they never checked on me and of course they wouldn't ask how it was since they know they served me cold food. You guys definitely lost a customer I will never be back. YUCK"}
{"text":"I love their lunch specials! You get a lot of food for $6 and it was delivered FAST. Everything I've tried is super tasty. Lovely service too. Recommend!"}
{"text":"I was cruising for something to eat on my lunchbreak at work, and in fact I had another place in mind (but couldn't find it) so I wound up coming here, instead.  To my pleasant surprise, everyone was super nice and very helpful.  As I'd never been here before, I asked for suggestions and tried the Pad Thai (which I've never had ever - here or anywhere else) and I thought it was immensely tasty.  Being a vegetarian, I opted for no meat and they helpfully obliged, even adding in tofu (at my discretion.)  I also got the thai tea, which I adore: delicious.  Added boba which was super soft and silky smooth, exactly as it should be.    While I waited, they bought be a bowl of free soup also, a spicy and sour (I think that's what it was called) egg soup in a chicken broth (for hardcore vegans or veggies - avoid) but it was super tasty and I sort of regret not ordering it in the first place.  Overall I think this place is brilliant.  Not very modern, but very clean and friendly with great food and good people.  I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is literally the worst place... Do not come here for anything the portions are way small the food does not taste fresh and the service is the worst   ugh i only came because co-workers love the Thai coffee but I literally hate this place. I refuse to eat here"}
{"text":"The lunch trays are just enough to get you full. I love the orange chicken and spring rolls. Amazing but very outdated decor and the silk plants are very old and very unappealing, but foods great."}
{"text":"Great food all around.  Authentic as can be.  Chefs straight from Thailand, can't ask for anything more.  Thai iced tea and coffee is so good here.   Come check this place out if you're ever in town because buffets can get boring."}
{"text":"Always see this restaurant when I'm grocery shopping at smiths. Curiosity kicked in and wanted to try. Outside appearance was not appealing. I almost didn't go in. But before I was gona leave I decided to depend on my yelp friends. It seemed to have some good reviews.   First impression was divey. Really needs some help. Decor is old and the place is small. However the lady was very nice. I ordered chicken pad Thai from lunch special. The menu says you get soup. Then she nicely tells me you only get soup if you done in. She was nice and offered me done while I wait for my food. Maybe she heard my stomach growl. Lol .. My friend ordered orange chicken. Also from lunch special. Was happy when I got the bill. It was $12 for both meals. Now that's what I call a lunch special   When I got home. I noticed they gave decent proportion sizes. My chicken pad Thai was delicious. My friends orange chicken was good but the sauce was more runny than what I'm use to seeing. Didn't care for the fried rice. It taste like corn bread to me. Next time I'm going with white rice. It also came with salad. Which is nothing fancy. Lil lettuce with ranch and crunchy won ton. They didn't have any other dressing choices. I will come back and try more things."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the shrimp papaya salad. They had huge shrimp very delectable. Great mom and pop, hole in the wall restaurant to go too."}
{"text":"My mom was in town and we wanted Thai food.. This was by my house and the theater so we decided to give it a try. We got their pad Thai lunch specials, and neither of us even ate half of it. I thought it was \"ok\" my mom thought it was pretty bad. I wouldn't come back for Thai food. The pad Thai didn't have that distinct flavor, it lacked flavor. There weren't even peanuts in it, which isn't a huge deal but I was just surprised."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for many years. They have the best lunch menu and prices! They have never disappointed me. I'd walk in and greeted and seated in less than a minute. Service is really top notch and you never have to wait long for your food to come out.      Some of my favorite dishes here are the spaghetti mint chicken, shrimp pad Thai, crab Rangoons, coconut soup and the Singapore noodles. Their pad thai is pretty sweet though, just in case you don't like it too sweet. For dessert they have a coconut ice cream with actual shavings inside and served in a coconut.        So recently they hired new staff. They are still very friendly, but an incident happened and I feel they could have handled it better. The other day I was enjoying my Singapore beef noodles and as I'm eating the rice ball I notice not 1 stand of hair, but multiple stands cooked and stuck throughout the rice. I told the waitress and she apologized and asked if I wanted her to take it back. I was practically done with my dish so I said no. I was still craving a little rice, so I decided to dig in to my wife's rice ball. I couldn't believe my eyes! Multiples strands cooked within this rice ball. I called the waitress over and tried to pull the stands out to show her. All she said was sorry. At the end of the meal she decided to comp our $3 Thai tea. I feel that she should have done more to make up for that awful experience.       I truly love this place and I really enjoy the different flavors they have on the menu, but how they handled this situation really turned me off. I don't know if I actually ate any stands of hair or if it was all psychological, but I seriously felt like I was about to cough up a hairball throughout the day. I still will recommend trying their food, but please check the rice ball before diving in! The end."}
{"text":"It's not much to look at inside, but on balance I do recommend this. If you're a clean freak then I wouldn't make a visit, the furniture is badly dated and badly worn, this includes the table that you'd be eating on. It's rife with dusty, artificial foliage.   If you can overlook that, the food is great! I usually order Schezuan chicken and I've never been disappointed. The chicken is juicy, the produce is crisp and fresh and overall the meals are delicious without being typically chinese-takeout-greasy.  The girls who greet you are refreshing. Unpretentious, humble and intelligent. English skills are lacking but let's be honest, that's part of the experience. It makes for great ambiance.   The lunch specials are great at 6 bucks. Try em."}
{"text":"Decided to stop by for lunch and was pleasantly surprised by this little mom n pop.  The restaurant isn't too big, couple of tables in the middle flanked by four booths on each side. Bangkok Orchid seems to be family run which is usually means you get better and more personalized service. Coming in during lunch, it was great to a wide selection of lunch specials priced at $5.95.  I had the chili mint chicken level 8, crab ragoons, and a thai iced tea with boba. My entree, the chili mint comes in a little bento box style plate, complete with salad, a scoop of rice, a eggroll, egg drop soup, and a generous portion of the chicken. The chicken is delicious; very similar to what you would find in the lettuce wrap filling at PF Changs. But I will say that level 8 isn't as spicy as it sounds.  The crab ragoons were great, about 8 small empanda style ragoons stuffed with imitation grab and cream cheese. A perfect appetizer. My thai iced tea was pretty good but it would been nicer if it was a little bigger for the $3 they charged for it.   Overall Bangkok Orchid is a great gem for anyone looking for Asian fare. Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"I have to revise my last review. I had given this place 4 stars but after the last couple of visits, I must rate them down. Food has been terrible lately. I don't know if they have changed cooks or what but my pad see ew (sp?)and it was saturated in oil. I could not even eat it. The waitress was not our regular girl and did nothing to resolve the issue with the food. Just took it away and charged for full price for it."}
{"text":"Me and my husband love eating here! This is a hidden gem in henderson and is also close to where i work. We love the food and service! Our favorite is the lunch special. You get everything in one order. Food taste great!"}
{"text":"I thought the food was good, but not as good as Thai Chili down the street. I ordered drunken noodles and a Thai tea from both restaurants, 8/10 spicy. This place was a little spicier, but other than that I thought the quality/ service was not as good and the prices were more expensive."}
{"text":"Kind of hard to find, but I consider this place a gem!  Even though their interior and decor is WAY outdated, the quality of their food is still awesome!  And the only reason I'm giving it 4/5 stars is because of their outdated interior.  Very small place too.  Their menu consists of both Thai and Chinese, but mostly Thai.  I had a small bowl of shrimp dumpling won ton soup.  This is the kind of wonton that doesn't fall apart, and in a small bowl of soup, they included a generous amount of dumplings.  This you must get!  I also had the Pad Thai and the Beef Panang Curry.  I ordered spicy 5 out of 10, and it was SPICY!  My taste buds were on fire, but I could not stop eating the Panang.  I thought I was going to end up taking leftovers home, but I ended up finishing my plate because it was so good!"}
{"text":"When I went, they weren't busy at all.  I was with a group of 10 and nobody else was there at 6 PM.  Decor was fine and service was quite fast considering the large group we had.    I ordered the chicken panang, which is the first thing I have at any Thai restaurant.  I implored them to make it as spicy as possible.  When I got it I was pretty shocked.  It was sufficiently creamy, but there wasn't a single pepper in the dish.  Essentially they had added a bunch of dried chili flakes, but they weren't spicy at all.  It ended up being about a 2/10 on my scale in terms of spice.  More than that, though, it was disgusting.  It didn't taste like panang at all, the chicken was of mediocre quality, and there were large pieces of what seemed like cabbage in the panang -- something I've never seen any place else.  I struggle to give this place more than 1 star.  Great service, but the worst Asian food I've ever had in my life.  If you want Thai, go to Thai Room, Thai Style Noodle House, or Lotus of Siam -- all similarly priced places with much better food."}
{"text":"There is nothing special about this place.  I ordered a Thai salad.  It was just a green standard salad, I was a bit thrown off by the egg on the salad.  I don't think I've ever had a Thai salad with egg before. We also had soup and the chicken in the soup was very tough and chewy.  We also ordered Sticky sweet rice and ice cream.  I don't think they use the correct type of rice for this dish.  The taste was off.  I only gave it 1 star because my boyfriend loved the fried bananas. The decor is on the verge of tacky (wooden chairs w/green padding), fake floral everywhere.  They were nice but I would not spend money on another meal in that place."}
{"text":"Never been there for dinner, but the lunch specials are pretty good for the price... I want to say it's like 6.95 and you get this plastic compartmentalized tray (yes like from the lunch lady in high school) with a salad, your entree (like 20 to choose from), a spring roll, a bowl of soup (usually 2 to choose from), and [get this] red jello. I actually thought the jello was a thai dipping sauce at first; much to my surprise, my spring roll bounced up from the surface of the jello like it was on a trampoline. I was confused for a moment, but then happy to revisit my youth and enjoy a cup of jello.  Check it out for lunch."}
{"text":"Wow... I'm really torn about 3 or 4 stars because this is really a 3.5.    My girl friend, her son and I were cravin' some Thai but reluctant to drive all the way into Vegas for our favorite joints so we ended up at Bangkok Orchid.  The restaurant was clean, service was nice and food was tasty so... what was the problem?  Well, the chicken in our dishes was a lil tough and when we ordered chicken and shrimp pad thai... though the flavor was great, there was literally only 2 shrimp on it.  With the 3 of us, that wasn't even 1 shrimp each.  Sheesh!    Garlic Chicken was tasty, Pad Thai was tasty and Black Pepper beef was good... loved their veggies.  I'd go again but next time, if there's not more shrimp, it'll be mutany.  Might see ya there."}
{"text":"Stopped by here after class and decided to get a quick beer and a meal for happy hour during 3-5p.  The restaurant has nice decor and the waitress was very nice.  The lunch specials are priced well and the 2-for-1 beer special is also very nice and inviting.  I had opted for the orange tofu entree and it came with a salad, fruit, and rice to go with it.  The food was alright.. not the best Thai food I've had but it for the price, it was very nice.  Definitely earned another happy-hour stop in by yours truly."}
{"text":"Another gem i found! i got here about 3pm it was not busy at all. actually it was just me and a friend. i was kinda worry but not haha. its seems family owned. right when i went in i was greeted and seated right away and our servers brought water right away! i love when they do that instead of us the customers ask for it. she gave us a few minutes to decided what we want to order. i decided to go the pad see eww . for $5.95 deal! it comes with soup . may i say this soup was really good and flavorful than the other place ive tried thumbs up! also salad, rice, eggroll, slice of fruits. it didn't not take to long for it to be cooked. im really use to big portions maybe thats why im overweight haha. but this was just the right amount! the staff was nice and friendly. place was clean aswell . do try this gem out!"}
{"text":"We happened to see this restaurant as we're passing by and decided to go in. We were pleasantly surprised at how good the food was and how friendly the staff. We had the papaya salad, fried swordfish with sweet sour sauce and the combination seafood over glass noodles. While the food was not too hot, there was a hint of a spiciness to it. We had the fried bananas for dessert.  We enjoyed the food here, an alternative to our regular meals and the Las Vegas buffets."}
{"text":"it's been years since I've checked this place out. The outdated decor features a wooden fish in a sea of bright plastic floral being  more noticeable than the actual thai dancer figures hidden in a far corner. The place could also use some deep cleaning and light adjustment. Although it is a dreary looking place, the quality in food is still pretty good. We ordered the chicken satay, possibly marinated in turmeric, a little dry so I needed extra peanut sauce. Pad See  Ew,   beef with flat rice noodles, egg, broccoli, carrot and sweet soy, which tasted delicious and saucy, not oily. We also had ground chicken with peppers, onions and Thai basil, no spice, juicy and perfect atop rice. There was only one hostess who  also sat customers and took orders, so she did what she could about giving everyone equal attention. Kudos to her, but they could have someone to take care of the tables while this lady can attend to others. I would come back , but maybe with a to go order instead."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Thai places in Vegas/Henderson.  If you like Tom Kha Gung soup (spicy coconut milk soup with shrimp) this is the place to get it!  They know how to make it just spicy enough and are generous with the mushrooms and shrimp (or chicken if that's your preference).  Their lunch special is also very inexpensive and HUGE for the price, as are most items on their menus.  I would recommend their shrimp cup appetizers, but the last time I went they had stopped offering them...maybe it's a seasonal thing?  Anyway, if you see them on the table display, order them!  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The food here are as close to authentic as you would get in Thailand. Just be careful with the spicy level. If you can ignore the tacky Interior decor from 1983, you'll enjoy the food here."}
{"text":"We had delicious tom yum shrimp soup. We loved the seafood basket. Service was very good and quick also."}
{"text":"Took a pad Thai to-go for lunch. The lunch specials are wonderfully priced, but the food is a tad over saucey. The noodles aren't the think flat ones, it's like the noodles used in satay...huh. But it's good and is recommend it for anyone looking/craving for Thai for lunch."}
{"text":"Bangkok Orchid is just a minute away from my school so I thought I'd give it a try.  A plus side is that their lunch special is until 3:30, which is pretty sweet cause usually lots of other Thai places I've been to don't have their lunch special that late in the day.  I ordered the pad thai and it was ok.  I've had better but they did give me big portions of chicken.  :)  Their salad was yummy but their rice tasted a bit old.  If anything, this place is great for getting a quick fix of Thai food."}
{"text":"A time warp into 1982.  As I understand, theis place hasn't changed one bit since it opened.    The food was good.  We cleaned everyone of our plates.  Schezhuan eggplant. panang chicen curry, shrimp pad thai, and orange chicken.  All very tasty.  The service left some things to be desired.  When we asked for our check, there was one other table in the dining room.  It took 22 minutes for us to get a check. Holy moly!  We ordered everything spicy 7 which will make me sweat at other Thai places, but not here.  No spice found.    Food is good.  Portions were a small for the price."}
{"text":"My kids love this place, my son orders the papaya salad and he downs that in less then 10 minutes. My mom even likes this place and she can't stand any other asian restaurant because she can make the food better at home.  It's her Asian pride I guess but everytime she visits me she wants to eat here. The seafood is what I order and it's awesome."}
{"text":"The food is pretty decent. It's very typical compared to other Thai restaurants. My only complaint are the waitresses who need a serious lesson in restaurant procedure.  We were greeted and seated and then the waitress walked away and sat at down at a booth with the other waitress to continue their  conversation.  We looked over the menu for about 5 minutes,  the entire time they sat and talked and never once asked us if we wanted a drink. When one decided to get up and walk over to us she immediately asked us if we were ready to order. I suggested that we at least get some water first. She seemed annoyed and then brought us over two glasses. These girls are lazy, rude and passive agressive. Why are people choosing to spend their hard earned money there? I know I've learned my lesson."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's so hard to find Chili mint chicken in town, let alone done right. I love that this place offers it in fried rice form and with the option of ground chicken. The portions good sized and the food is very flavorful. Can't go wrong with the lunch specials!"}
{"text":"The food tasted like home-made food. It was good but not good enough to beat the other authentic Thai places. However, their lunch price is incomparably affordable. For anyone who works around the area, this would be a great joint to have lunch since it would save you some daily spending."}
{"text":"I'm at this restaurant and a roach crawled on my glass of iced tea. Grossed me out. I can't eat now. They charged me for the appetizer but took off the entree. I'm never going back. At first they comped the whole meal, then the manager said no. It was disgusting."}
{"text":"Great little place. Don't let the outdated decor scare you away. Very generous portions and both yummy Thai and Chinese food :) My wife loves the pineapple fried rice with extra veggies and I like the pad Thai."}
{"text":"Ordered chicken fried rice. All I received was a bunch of white rice.. No vegetables and little chicken.. Don't waste your time going."}
{"text":"When you first walk in, you see old fake plants and chairs that could and should probably be  replaced. The smell of food isn't overwhelming. Any time I've ever been here, it is never busy, yet somehow they stay open every day from 11:00am to 10:00pm. The music is adorable. It's basically the karaoke version of songs without the lyrics. Great for a game of guess this song.   Food is ALWAYS amazing. I really enjoy it. This place has great service. I always get the fried rice and share. But today I just ordered the rice for myself and took it home with me, myself, and I. I'm al was recommending this place to friends and I've never been disappointed, neither have they."}
{"text":"Service was fast and friendly. I usually go for the lunch special which is a great deal and the food is excellent.  I suggest the Chili Mint Chicken, absolutely delicious.   Definitely recommend this spot if you're ever in the area and are looking for an affordable but satisfying meal."}
{"text":"Went last night because we wanted something new and spicy. It was fantastic. They laughed when we said hotter than a 10 please. The woman in the kitchen came out to check on us! Lol we told her it was fantastic. A hidden jewel. Behind the gas station in the parking lot of Barleys."}
{"text":"There is nothing more frustrating than a place with good food that has terrible service! They need to retrain their staff because I was under the impression that their servers have no prior serving experience. Their kitchen is probably run improperly because the food took FOREVER. I think we sat in our booth for about 45 min-1 hour for our appetizer. As I looked around the restaurant, I noticed the frustrated looks on all the customers' faces. The food was impressive... authentic, flavorful, and well portioned; however, my sister and I decided the food wasn't great enough to wait as long as we did, so we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I had wanted to try Bangkok Orchid. Trying different Chinese restaurants has been one of my interests as of late. So, this past Tuesday I took a break from errands to make this my Birthday lunch.     Bangkok Orchid is in the Mountain Vista Shopping Center, a mall that has seen some better days, with the large hobby shop and shops between Barley's and Smiths vacant. When I stepped inside Bangkok Orchid at 3:30 pm on Tuesday, it was vacant of customers.     The nice woman who was my waitress offered me the table of my choice then presented me with the menu. From going on Yelp, I knew all the $5.95 lunch specials. I'd order the chicken chow mein combination with hot tea. The tea was so delicious that I drank the tea kettle worth. It was worth the $1.50 extra. The egg drop soup that was included tasted different from the style I am accustomed to. I am aware that this is mostly a Vietnamese restaurant.  The presentation of the chicken chow mein luncheon was different from the way that restaurants have served it. It was served on a large black tray style plate with salad, a bowl of duck sauce to compliment the egg roll on the bottom left, a scoop of rice on the top right, and on the bottom right were two slices of oranges. The chicken chow mein took center stage on the black tray. It featured bean sprouts, nice chunks of white chicken, cabbage, carrots, and broccoli. The food was good. I appreciated the nice presentation at the same time I would have enjoyed more of the entree over the salad and oranges.     Dining here was a laid back experience. It was quiet. The soundtrack was instrumental versions of the classics including \"How Deep is your Love\"  and \"Love on the Rocks.\"     Overall Bangkok Orchid is a good restaurant. I could see a possible return check-in if I am leaving the close by  Ethal M Cactus Gardens on an empty stomach."}
{"text":"I have had the lunch special here two times. I wouldn't say it's the best thai food, but I like what they have to offer and the friendly service.   The first time I tried the Pad See-Ew, and it was perfectly done. Maybe because I was hungry, but it was the rich greasy ness and spicy ness and the vegetables were all good with it. The lunch always seems very, I can't think of the word, giving. I believe it came with soup, salad, vegetable roll, some sort of fruit or dessert, salad and the main dish. I think it also came with rice even though I had a noodle dish. The second time I had the Pad Thai, and that dish to me is always hit or miss. For me it was more of a miss, because I believe the sauce was too tangy and saucy, so that it would really make the noodle sticky and kind of overdone and not good. The beef in the dish didn't look very appetizing, but it was fine. I still thought everything was pretty good to eat, but it probably more leans toward 3 stars, but I like the place for no intelligible reason. The lunch special is only like $6 if I remember correctly. :D"}
{"text":"Always a nice place to stop before the movies.. as long as is not more than half full, The Waitresses can keep up with your needs.they must have a  small kitchen staff sometimes the food takes a little while to come out if it is a busy night. Have been coming here for years I've never been disappointed. The beef salad is one of the best that I have had... as long as I remember have the onions removed !!"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here and it was definitely amazing! We had the coconut milk soup with shrimp, shrimp fried rice, and I ordered the lunch special with pad Thai. So yummy! Flavors were spot on. Will definitely come back.   Get the lunch special if you want a little bit of an entree, rice, soup, salad, etc. for about $7! Definitely a good deal."}
{"text":"Here's what we had:  Green papaya salad x2 spring rolls chicken curry  beef on choi spicy soft shell crab (special that night)  Sticky rice Thai Iced Tea  All the food was gone between the four of us. No complaints! =)"}
{"text":"This is a hidden Thai food restaurant located in the same strip mall as Ross J's Aloha Grill and Roberto's tacos. I had a little trouble finding the restaurant because it was hidden. My experience dining here was pretty decent but I wasn't too impressed with the food.   My group went here after watching a movie down the street at Galaxy theaters at around 6pm on a Tuesday evening. The place was not too busy and the service provided was pleasant.  My group walked in and were seated immediately. The waitress was very kind and immediately gave us menus and food settings. She got our drink order and allowed us enough time to look at the menu. She was attentive and as soon as we put our menus down came rushing over. This was greatly appreciate because so many times waitresses are not attentive and fail to give enough time until the party is ready to order.  We (a party of three) shared w Spicy beef Salad, Chicken Panang, Thai Beef Jerky, and a medium Rice. Everything was decent but nothing special nor did any of the dishes make me crave more. However I did appreciate the service that the waitress provided."}
{"text":"They always impress , they are fast friendly and the food is always good .    It's one of those little treasures of Henderson"}
{"text":"GREAT CURRY!  This place has amazing thai food. Their curry is the best I have ever had. I am in love with the yellow and red specifically. I have tried several other dishes as well, and have not been let down. I will have to say to avoid the more Chinese oriented dishes though. They are very mediocre. The service is also really good.   My Only complaint is the drinks.. You can tell that they do not have a soda machine. They just pour cans into a glass. Which I can not stand. Its makes the drink just taste off most of the time. If im paying 2.50 for a drink I expect it to at least be good. My other sub-complaint is that the music is weird.. We sit there and wonder who picks that crap.. Its so bad that its funny at times. I want to say that last time we were there we heard \"I will always love you\" With clinky thai instruments. Very good laugh at that one.  Overall, a 4 star place. If they ever get better drinks and music I will bump up my rating."}
{"text":"Always a great deal, one of our favorites. Friendly, clean and great value Thai food."}
{"text":"All I can say is Pad see EWWWWWW. Literally, eww, yucky, and down right disgusting.   Writing this review is already upsetting me again. *Disclaimer* I am not a Thai food connoisseur, but I have been to a lot places in town from very high rated well known Thai restaurants with impeccable interiors and a cult following versus small, dingy hole in the wall type Thai foods. Let's even throw in some Thai fusion places in that mix.  Back to the pad see \"eww,\" I have ordered this enough times at other places to know what it is supposed to taste like. I am open to variations and unique takes on a dish, but this monstrosity was none of those.  First of all, appearance. The noodles are so pale, no sauce whatsoever. All I see is oil and small, black char marks everywhere (like they didn't clean the pan thoroughly or something!). The dish was tasteless, oily, and not authentic.   Service was a joke. Sorry not sorry. There were two younger ladies who were the hostesses/servers. I think they might be family members. They look like they absolutely hate their jobs. Slow service. All I wanted to do was get out of there. Never again!"}
{"text":"Love green curry here. Great for the price, especially lunch special. My husband likes mint chicken with spicy#10 and crab rangoon.  If you LIKE them on Yelp, you get free Thai tea--- Love it!"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick bite before the movies. You can't beat their lunch special.  It's a casual place. The lunch special is just $6.95. You choose your main dish and it comes with soup, salad, rice and a chicken dumpling. The salad was just some lettuce mostly but the sweet ranch dressing was tasty.   I had the spicy crispy chicken. The flavor was great but not that spicy. My husband had the green curry beef. Very good but a little heavy on the basil.   I think this is a good option for lunch when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Decided to give it another star due to my new-found obsession with this dish called strawberry chicken. It's completely unhealthy and basically just a yummier take on your typical sweet and sour fried chicken junk food crap, but I do love it so. If you like sweet and sour chicken or junk food chinese.. you must try this. MMM  I still think the pad thai is eh."}
{"text":"I love this place! Right down the street from my house and very affordable! They have a great lunch special and their regular menu is great too. I always get the spicy mint noodles with chicken and I'm always sad when it's gone. My fiancé got the spicy shrimp soup and that's really great too. They give you a special treat if you like them and check in there on facebook!"}
{"text":"I chose this place kind of on a roulette drive for lunch, and I am glad that I landed here instead of the nail store next door.  The Thai dishes were all very good, and they gave me free appetizers and a little Jell-o dish with my check.  With the affordable price, they didn't have to butter me up!    I asked for an 8 out of 10 on a yellow chicken curry, and they delivered.  It was delicious, plentiful and was served in a wizard's cauldron.  Well, it kind of looked like one.  Accio delicious curry!    The restaurant itself is very amusingly decorated with many, many, many artifical tropical flowers.  It's like eating in a terrarium.  The service is nice and never let my drink get to empty, and it was $11 for a really filling meal and soda, tip extra.  I am pretty sure 10 out of 10 on the heat here, due to it being pretty authentic local Thai, means the curry would burn through you like thermite through a steel plate.  It was hot!  But if you're into that, you'll be rewarded.   A very nice little find for Thai, and they deliver too!"}
{"text":"I was impressed with this place. It doesn't look like much from the outside and looks like the typical Thai Chinese food joint you've been to a million times. The older woman working was so nice, the young waitress was helpful but seemed a bit distracted at times. We ate our meals there. Not sure how this place rates at other times of day but it is lunch special heaven. I ordered the Crispy Spicy Chicken (substitute white rice for the fried rice) lunch special ($5.95) and an order of the Crab Rangoon ($7.95).  Crab Rangoon was really good, not greasy and I think it was real crab meat! 8 pieces comes with an order. The lunch special come with soup, which we got next. It was Egg Drop Soup, I don't typically get soup at Chinese restaurants but this was decent, had nice lite taste. A friend got the small Spicy Vegetable Soup (Heat level 3), it looked loaded with veggies. She said it was really good and even with a level 3 heat still had a nice kick to it. We got our lunch specials next which come presented on awesome trays, I felt so elegant, such a nice presentation. It came with a small lettuce salad with a creamy dressing and crispy wonton noodles, it was very fresh and crisp. A mound of rice, I opted for rice but it comes with a fried rice which the other girls seemed to like but wasn't anything to write home about. A crispy wonton I think was filled with chicken was tasty and unexpected. 2 orange slices. Our lunch choices, which was a nice amount of food. My Crispy Spicy Chicken I ordered at level 5 heat to play it safe, I like a bit of heat but not a lot. I could've gone up to a 6 or 7. The sauce was delicious, the chicken was super crispy crunchy and had not greasy. There seemed to be more crispy coating than chicken inside most of the chicken pieces but it was still really good. My friends got the Spicy Chili Mint (Heat Level 3) with Chicken and the Mix Vegetables with Shrimp and they both finished the dish and said they'd get it again! I am looking forward to going back and trying more, it's close to work for me and super cheap."}
{"text":"We came here because of all the positive reviews.  We walk and no one was there but the staff and us.    We stayed and I'm so glad we did.  I had Singapore noodles with vegetables cooked with yellow curry.  It was great.  My DH had ginger chicken.  He really like his as well.  The portions were rather large and staff were wonderful and treated us as if we go their daily.  We also ordered crab Rangoon and it had more crab than I've ever had before.    Only bad thing I can think of is I wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"Live not far away, which was how I decided to come here the other night for dinner.  The place is a solid three stars.  The food flavors were just a little off.  Not bad, but just kind of different.  We started off with the crab ragoons.  Inside there were shredded pieces of crab.  I like crab, but expected cream cheese holding the ragoon together.  I ordered the chicken pad Thai.  It had zero spice, no peanut, and instead of the normal flat noodles, it had string, see through rice noodles.  Now, it wasn't bad, it just wasn't want I wanted.  Husband had acceptable strawberry pork.    We tried them for dinner five or so years ago and I wondered why the place was off my radar.  Now, I know why.  Just not the flavors I'm looking for in a Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow. I live a block away and have been meaning to try this place. I walked in at 3:35, after lunch was over but the hostess let me order lunch specials to go anyhow. :D I got the pad thai and Spicy mint noodles.  Each lunch special comes with a little salad, pot sticker and fried rice. (Thats to go, I think in house dining also comes with soup.I also got a plate of delightful fried noodles to nibble on while I waited.)  I got home and dilly dallied around for a while before eating, a bad habit of mine. But even after about a half an hour when I sat down to eat, the food was still really hot.  Everything was delicious, I asked for a level 7 spice level and got  a true seven.  The rice was very mild flavored, but a bit spicy and I wish I knew how they made it because it would be a great side dish for any Asian food. The salad had a ranch with a kick of sweetness to it topped with wantons. The pad thai was very good, and I could'nt get enough of the spicy mint noodles.  The staff was friendly and the restaurant was cozy and clean.  I am so glad I tried this place, and since they deliver (oh joy and rapture) I will definitely be a regular here.   Edit: I am a regular here, the service is always great and the food is always awesome."}
{"text":"I didn't really like it. The service was slow & their panang curry was just weird. Probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"First time here and awesome place!! Heard from a friend this was a great Chinese/Thai restaurant and it didn't disappoint!  Great service, great food, pleasant staff!"}
{"text":"I love eating at this place! It is definitely one of the best Thai places in Henderson. I always eat their Pad Thai, yellow curry, and even their Fried Catfish with red curry sauce. One time when I ate there, I was craving for Panang curry with catfish, which was a dish I only ate when I was back in California, and asked them if they would make it. They did, and it tasted just as good as the one back home! I have eaten at many Thai restaurants in the area (even the new one on Eastern/Richmar plaza), but this is the best. I always take friends and family here to eat when they're craving for Thai food. They are very generous with their portions, and even give you jello or mixed fruits at the end for dessert (and free of charge). I love eating here!  *Update: 5/31: I just found out that they do lunch specials for $5.95, and even on WEEKENDS! Gotta give them 5 stars now!"}
{"text":"Quick thai craving fix. Food is OK, not bad or not phenomenal. Thai food in general, it can't be bad since it's all sweetened. Like their cheap lunch special to go, because I am not a person with the BEST posture, but I've never been to a restaurant where it acutually forces me to seat 90 degree angle straight back with my knee hitting the table since the restaurant is very small with limited space.  Better if you know what you like and get it to go."}
{"text":"I've gone to this place for lunch a few times, but never dinner. They have the same good food, just more of it. :-)  I had the red curry chicken. I really love the taste and get it every time. I usually get a 6 (medium). Today the six seemed awfully spicy, but very good. The service is always good. I have never seen it crowded in this place. The decor is nothing special. It is a great place to go to beat the crowd, have good food, and good service."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for when I don't feel like cooking. They have excellent panang, they satay is moist and flavourful, the chicken coconut soup is spicy and tangy and all around yummy, I'd also recommend their chili mint egg noodles with the shrimp. Their delivery is quick and reliable and the food is always hot when it arrives."}
{"text":"Very tasty food.  Well presented.  Friendly and a great deal for the prices on their lunch menu"}
{"text":"Pass on this one.  Had the lunch special, which is no better or no worse than thousands of other Chinese / Thai restaurants. Entree was very small, but it was off the lunch menu.  Very average. I went in there about 12:30 on a weekday and there was only one other customer (hmm should have been a tip off to turn around)  The kicker came when they brought the bill and tacked on 50 cents for using a credit card. If you are going to do that, announce it upfront, not after the meal. ARCO charges 35 cents to use a debit card, but they announce it before you pump the gas and you have to agree to it.  I took back the $2.00 cash tip and paid the 50 cents.  The manager had been my waitress.  I told her it was a very expensive 50 cent charge, as it cost her a $2.00 tip PLUS, since the restaurant is at best average, I see no reason to ever return.  Ping Pong down the road is MUCH better."}
{"text":"This is a great place nearby where we live. Its never too crowded and the lunch specials are good. We took our baby son there and they have convenient high chairs. The menu has a good selection of food. I try different things here so it's tough to say what's my favorite. I would recommend this place if you live in the hood and would like a decent meal."}
{"text":"This is in my new neighborhood, so decided to drop in and check it out. Solid 3.5 stars.  Quaint little place that has a nice happy hour with 2 for 1 beers and 1/2 appetizers 3-6pm. We arrived after 6, so missed out on that good deal.  Prices seems fair. Service was very good, greeted promptly, seated, and served by a nice waitress who was very attentive. We were only 1 of 3 tables in use on a Saturday night. Couple take out orders arrived as well.  I ordered chicken coconut milk soup Tom Kah Kai (4/5), and pad see ew pork (3/5). My friend order Tom Yum Goong soup and spicy chili mint combo seafood. She enjoyed them both and since she is Thai...must have been good.  My Pad See Euw was a bit bland, lacking the sweet soy sauce flavor that I like. I probably wouldn't order that again as there are better in town.  Overall, nice little place, will return I'm sure."}
{"text":"My friend and I come here quite often for their lunch special. Service is always nice and quick. Their lunch special includes soup of the day, salad, rice, a veggie egg roll, and an entree of your choosing. My two favorite dishes are the chili mint chicken and the mint rice noodles. They always ask the level of spice that you prefer on a scale of 1-10. I usually like my food to be really spicy, so I often order it at a level of 9 and it comes out with a nice kick! The cost of all this? Just $6!"}
{"text":"I like the fact that this place delivers, however the food is just okay. I ordered chicken friend rice, which was really good. The Pad Thai tasted weird and had this sweet flavor that didn't make it appetizing one bit! I've only eaten here once, but it didn't really make a great impression.  Not sure if I would go here again."}
{"text":"I've lived in Green Valley ever since 1979 and I am sad to say it took me this long to try Bangkok Orchid. It has been there forever and I've driven past it many times. After trying to order from Pingkao and being told they wouldn't deliver to my house because it was too far (even though they've delivered 5 other times and sent menus to me in the mail...dumb) my girlfriends and I found the menu on line and ordered. First of all, it was crazy cheap! We had leftovers of everything too since the portions were plentiful. We ordered the Panang chicken curry, stir-fried glass noodles, pineapple fried rice, and some sort of salad with ground chicken. Everything was fabulous. I highly recommend!"}
