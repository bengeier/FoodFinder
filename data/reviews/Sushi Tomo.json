{"text":"I am Japanese, so I know good Japanese food, and the food here is pretty good.  Certainly not the best I have ever had, but good, and the prices are reasonable.  The miso soup is especially good here, not watered down like most other Japanese places around here."}
{"text":"I always have a good experience there. I'vehad lunch and dinner at Tomo sushi. Sushi is delicious. One of the best japanese restaurant in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Sushi Tomo is the best place to get good, fresh sushi in the North Hills. They have a wide variety of rolls on the menu and always have good specials."}
{"text":"Another excellent meal yesterday.  We had chicken teriyaki, beauty Alaska roll, scallop heaven roll, rock and roll.  All of the food tastes fresh.  Good portions and we were served quickly even though the place was packed.  The staff are all very friendly.  They take the Entertainment card every visit.  Always order takeout from here as well.  No matter how large the order they always have it ready by the time I get there within 20 minutes.  Love this place."}
{"text":"2 thumbs up. Great food very extensive menu. Highly recommend. Even vegetarians have good sushi options. Tofu skin roll for vegetarians is a must try. Best sushi restaurant thus far"}
{"text":"Dined for the first time this evening. I chose sushi while my boyfriend ordered General Tsos chicken. I have to say that it was some of the best sushi I have ever eaten in Pittsburgh and beyond. Service was amazing and out server Natalie was extremely nice and attentive. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in Pittsburgh! I make it a point to hit this little gem every time I come to town. I've been to Tomo at least 10 times, and both the service and the food are consistently top-notch. The fish is incredibly fresh and flavorful. The sashimi practically melts in my mouth like butter, and the seaweed salad includes cucumbers and oranges to enhance the flavor. The miso soup is savory and delicious, and when we asked our waitress if the chefs could make the edamame with garlic, they gladly obliged. It turned out great!  The rolls here are creative, flavorful, and beautifully presented. My faves are the flower, the geisha, and the beauty Alaska. They're so good that every bite is a foodgasm. I also love the wide variety of sake they offer, as well as the yummy mochi ice cream. I recommend the green tea, mango, and red bean flavors.   I usually come here for lunch, and it's never super-crowded. The food comes out at the perfect pace. All the servers are very personable and friendly, and I was impressed with our server the other day--she remembered our entire (looong) order without writing anything down. If you haven't tried Tomo yet, you must!!"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years and love it!  I read another review that said the miso soup is not good.  Strange because it's my favorite miso soup of any Asian place around, I think it's great.  Everything I've had there has been really good.  My favorite roll is a spider roll which they do very well.  All the sushi rolls are very good.  I haven't had any of the dishes with a Chinese lean since they converted to Japanese/Chinese cuisine.  I'll have to try one next time, but still get a sushi roll!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good. The fish is fresh, prepared beautifully and makes you feel good. The feel good part is very important, specially when you are about to stuff yourself with a whole bunch of rice. :)  I have been here only once and had outstanding service. Our server mistakenly ordered an extra roll for me (which I ate) and then stuck a $10 bill with the check for the extra roll, because the order was already processed and she couldn't stop the machine from charging us for it. Very impressive! She was very attentive too! I made sure I gave her a big enough tip so she didn't have to feel too bad."}
{"text":"A good selection of sushi and sashimi. Also fair portions for relatively good prices. The food is mostly traditional Japanese restaurant food."}
{"text":"Everything came out SUPER fast and fresh. We ordered eggplant dumplings which went away in seconds. They were super fresh and hot. The tempura was light and crunchy while the inside remained soft and ever so delicious. It melted in my mouth, which is something shrimp seldom does on its own.   We also ordered a bunch of rolls, and I must point out the spicy tuna and the volcano roll were my favorites, despite everything being so perfect, simply because the tempura flakes/shrimp tempura texture really stood out in comparison to the soft, sticky rice. It was super pleasant.  I will say, however, that the rolls are extremely small, and while the place doesn't really have any rolls unique to itself, provides a traditional flavor that is amazing.   Last time I was here I also had general tso's chicken, which I would HIGHLY reccomend. It came out fresh so it was still nice and crunchy, and with the perfect sauce it was literally the best thing ever. Plus I think it was only $11? Super nice!  I've never had to wait more than 15 minutes for all of my food, despite how much the group orders. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys sushi."}
{"text":"This is the freshest sushi in Pittsburgh and surrounding area in my opinion. My husband and I have been eating here for a number of years. We have eaten from their roll menu, sashimi, and traditional menu. Our favorite rolls are the Geisha roll (heavenly!) and the yellowtail roll. The shrimp and broccoli is sooooo good it's a tough decision which to order. The prices are very reasonable considering the quality of the ingredients. The staff is friendly. If you have room for dessert definitely try the strawberry mochi."}
{"text":"What can I say about sushi tomo?!?!... Besides the fact that it's a hidden gem in Pittsburgh for delicious sushi it has other unbelievably delicious Japanese food! The service is so kind and attentive, I should know I go AT LEAST once a week. If you are looking for a great place to get sushi, sushi tomo is the place. Must eats: volcano roll, dinosaur roll."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Sushi Tomo for years and they are very consistent with high quality Japanese & Chinese dishes!  I try to get at least one new item every time I come here, stretching my comfort zone far beyond when I first started dabbling with Chinese and Japanese. I can honestly say I have never got an item I did not throughly enjoy. Which is insane to me!   I love that the green tea is served in a traditional Japanese tea kettle. I love how friendly the staff is, I love how delicious the food is. I love EVERYTHING ABOUT this place!   Every time Sushi tomo comes up in a conversation I am quick to praise them! Do yourself a favor and get to sushi tomo if you have never been there or if you are having doubts about wether or not it is good because it is!!!!   This place has the Will Koz seal of approval!"}
{"text":"IF I LIVED CLOSER I'D GO EVERY WEEK!  This is a real gem of sushi making in the North Hills! We went here after reading some reviews and loved the place! The sushi is awesome. Prices aren't cheap but you're paying for quality.   Menu Fav: Volcano Roll"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi. Great taste and very generous portions. You can tell that all the ingredients are fresh. The staff is also really friendly!  Only downside is that it's a bit pricey, but you get your money's worth. The McKnight Roll and Caterpillar Roll deserve mentioning :)"}
{"text":"Tried this based on the good reviews, very satisfied! I highly recommend if you're looking for some good sushi and miso soup."}
{"text":"A solid sushi joint. A very traditional place, with the sushi chefs right in the middle of the restaurant. The place was small, but very quaint. We started off with some egg rolls and oh man, they were huge! Very crunchy and flavorful. And then then sushi! Definitely the best I have had in a long time. Everything was so fresh and well prepared. Located in a very convenient place, this place will definitely become a regular thing for me!"}
{"text":"I ordered the eel, octopus, and shrimp sashimi. The portions were generous, fresh, and fairly priced. Each was delicious. They came prepared with slices of cucumber and I opted for white rice on the side.   My wife got two sushi rolls and enjoyed them so much that she insisted repeatedly that I try a piece. I finally relented. (She was right, they were delicious)  Service was prompt and attentive.  Conclusion: this is a great spot for sushi and sashimi. As many of the reviewers have mentioned, the food tastes fresh. You simply cannot fake that, and freshness is incredibly important to good sushi."}
{"text":"This is a classic. A shouldn't-miss even for the inveterate sushi snob. Ignore the middle of the menu (General Tso?) and head right for the sushi and sashimi.  The miso soup is absolutely worth it.    The ambiance doesn't have the hipster-chic vibe of other sushi places.  Rather it evokes a place where criminals in a 1970s cop show might meet up to plan a heist, but that's a small price to pay for really fresh, well-prepared sushi."}
{"text":"Used to do business lunches at the Tokyo sushi place across McKnight by Best Buy.  When they closed suddenly, we were left scrambling to find a new sushi place.  I'm ridiculously particular about sushi so yes .... I'm that annoying twit roll you eyes at when trying to find good sushi.  So, imagine the scene trying to actually get me IN to this place because let me tell you something kids.  The outside is unimpressive.  It looks like an old Hardee's turned crack house if I'm going to be honest.  However, what was borderline terrifying on the outside quickly turned to comfortable optimism as soon as you walk through the door.  So as to not blather on all day let me just say I have found the replacement.  The service was prompt and the sushi was fresh and delicious with a pretty great selection.  I will definitely be returning.  Creepy exterior and all."}
{"text":"Went here recently with my husband because our weird coupon book that my mom got us had a deal for Sushi Tomo.  I must say that this was some pretty tasty food!  We had 2 kinds of sushi, plus I had the vegetable stir fry and he had the chicken.  I thought my dinner was probably the best veggie stir fry that I've ever had.  He was given a HUGE portion of chicken, and he liked it, except for the soup (I had the Miso, and that was fine).  The ambiance is a little... meh, but it was a nice experience overall; I definitely see us going back!"}
{"text":"Went here because it is between my house and my friends. The place smells pretty bad of fish. But it is a sushi place. The service was pretty bad. I got there first and ordered a drink. My friends got there and ordered drinks and then our waitress disappeared...for 20 minutes. Finally, we get another girls attention and she ends up taking our order. We got the stuffed mushrooms, they were overly fishy tasting and no one ate them. The sushi was So-so,  but my friend had to spit some out because the fishy taste was so bad. Another friend said the chicken and cheese rolls were good but the onions were so overpowering that his eyes were watering. It seems to me like these are all symptoms of ingredients that are a little past their prime. I won't be going here again."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Sushi Tomo for a few years and we decided to give it a try tonight. It was delicious and such a great value.  We started out with the gyoza (dumplings - was hungry and forgot to take a pic). They were so authentic and delicious. The sauce that went with them was unreal.  For our entrees we shared the chicken fried rice, which was a huge portion for $8.95. It also had big pieces of chicken and was scrumptious. We could not get enough of it. We also had the spicy tuna roll sushi, which tasted so good and had these awesome crunchy things in it. The Boston roll (with shrimp, avocado & cucumber) was very good, but I thought the spicy tuna roll had a lot more flavor.  The food came out pretty fast & the service was good.   I highly recommend this place for the quality of the food, value & service."}
{"text":"After an exhausting day at the convention center, called from my hotel and ordered takeout chirashi with clear soup. Fresh, tasty. But the most amazing thing was that they had oshitashi! Yummy!! Drove over, picked it up, headed back to the hotel and absolutely enjoyed everything."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by it's location (among the bland strip of suburbian chain restaurants on McKnight Rd), this is good sushi!  I've been to Sushi Tomo several times and have never had a bad experience.  The service is always friendly and QUICK!  It's never crowded and I've never had to wait for a table (I'd actually love to see more people here!)  We never venture off the sushi menu, but honestly there's no reason to with sushi this good!  For the price and the quality, you can't beat it.  OK, so it's not Umi...but I would take it over Nakama sushi any day of the week.  Great rainbow roll, tasty volcano roll, fresh standards (salmon roll, tuna roll).  We in the North Hills are lucky to have such a fantastic place so close."}
{"text":"The service was good and we were greeted and seated right away.  The miso soup was not very good. It was sweet and had a weird flavor.  It wasn't the tastiest sushi I've ever had, it was just OK. I had the yellowtail roll, crazy tuna roll, and caterpillar roll. They had a decent selection of Japanese beer, which was good."}
{"text":"One of our absolute favorite sushi places in the North Hills. We come here a few times a year. Tonight we tried a few new dishes - the vegetable gyoza and the Beauty Alaska Roll - as well as our favorite Rainbow Roll and a few sushi pieces of salmon and tuna.  The gyoza was excellent! It was delicate and perfectly crunchy with the right ratio of vegetable filling that balanced well with the dipping sauce.  I have to say the new Beauty Alaska Roll, with its crown of delightful tiny black roe that was neither too salty nor too fishy, and its spicy filling with salmon was OUTSTANDING. Really tremendous flavor and texture.   Of course the rainbow roll was great as always too. Great meal again."}
{"text":"They are always so kind and attentive to me when I come in! I love all of their items that I tried so far. Immense value for the price. This is my go to place for sushi/Japanese in the North Hills area."}
{"text":"Just went there this weekend for the first time.  The sushi was super-fresh and incredibly tasty.  Would go there again in a heartbeat.  Be careful though - getting the sushi a la carte can add up quickly."}
{"text":"Stop there after shopping all day on Black Friday. I'm an sushi restaurant explorer. It's not that I'm an expert or anything. I just like to eat sushi. Some sushi restaurant doesn't serve Udon but this one does. They give you Japanese chili with the soup too. There sushi and rolls had the right sweet and sour test. Fish was fresh. I only give them 4 because I which they would have some rolls that are different from other sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"The best salmon north of the Mason Dixon line.   If you wish for some great fish, this is the place bitch!   Service was exceptional but more flattery is to be desired.  The food was a little too healthy.  I recommend ordering it right before close. As close to closing time as possible for best quality."}
{"text":"I stopped in here on my way to class (and after an especially monstrous day of work) and I've gotta say, it was great!!  I sat at the sushi bar and my two rolls were AMAZING! Now granted, I normally don't get real fancy sushi rolls, but the ones I got were great!! My server was really nice (and spoke perfect English) and it was overall a great experience! I can't wait to come back here for dinner!!"}
{"text":"Spicy Tuna is as legit as anywhere else in the city. I always get to go, but it's nice to see the sushi chef's working so hard right when you walk in. Tuna on top and salmon roll on the bottom, also delicious!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Best rice plates ever- teriyaki beef or chicken! Service is always wonderful & fast. Highly recommend this sushi place to all sushi lovers!!"}
{"text":"I have been here so many times I've lost count. I moved here from LA, the U.S. sushi capital (along with NYC), and couldn't find a decent sushi bar. Some were passable (Sushi Kim, Sushi Too), but nothing at all to rave about. Granted, access to fresh fish is more stifled than the coasts, but a lot of other inland cities seem to hold their own. Sushi Tomo is the best I've found yet! Sure, there are some sushi buffets around that give you more for less, their mantra is mostly quantity over quality. Tomo's small sushi bar never seems too crowded, and their fish is top notch. Try tobika with a quail egg - it's a burst of color and unbelievable flavor all at once."}
{"text":"This place was an amazing find. Our favs are the Spicy tuna and Philadelphia roll with the smoked salmon. Although the sushi is top notch I just wish they gave u more in your sushi roll. Very thick rolls I just think there should be 8-9 pieces instead of only 6. The Amazing Chicken is insanely delicious, absolutely all white chicken with a nice mild spicy sweet sauce. The portions are big enough on the entrees to share but I do suggest maybe ordering an extra side of white rice. The waitress's are laid back, some are better than others ( we had a waitress kinda hang out at their bar area one time a lil too long than we could handle) The place is very clean and the prices are decent. I would suggest trying if u love Japanese cuisine. Bust their sushi is the very best!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday because I wanted the best sushi. My husband decided to take me here. And let me just say this place deserves 10 stars if possible. We where greeted immediately and got our drinks quickly. Service was great and the food was outta this world! I've eaten a lot of sushi in my life and i have to say this place beats out anywhere I've ever eaten sushi. Portions are generous for the price! All the ingredients I could tell where fresh! Even if you're not a sushi eater their other dishes are just as good! The general so chicken let me just say I've never eaten it before apparently( other restaurants general so chicken can't touch this stuff) because I just kept stealing my husband's lol it was sooo good. I will be back! Thank you for existing! You're sushi made my birthday all the more special! Yinz guys rock keep it up!"}
{"text":"Got wasabi shumai and regular shumai. The regular was a little bland but good, the wasabi ones were awesome, given you like wasabi of course! We also got 3 or 4 sushi rolls, which were all good, (geisha roll, spicy king crab roll is what I remember), and the service was GREAT!"}
{"text":"Everything ordered were delicious! The sake and unagi sushi were extremely fresh! You can taste the sweetness in each bite! The spring roll and fried dumplings were a hit with my 7 year old! Service was superb and the atmosphere was very comfortable! Will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"We heard about this from a friend. This is the best sushi we have had in Pittsburgh! I have never dined in, always take out, so I don't know about service. But prices are very reasonable. The Sushi has always been extremely flavorful and makes me want to spend all my money there!"}
{"text":"Tried there traditional Chinese Menu.   A friend of my recommended this place to me as the best Shanghai style restaurant. For a long time I found it hard to believe due to the name. I just simply think if people decide to use an kind of food as the name of their restaurant, that must be their signature dish! Right? But I hear good things about them from couple other friends as well.   So I finally decide to give it a try. I have to say I am surprised and sad that I didn't come here earlier. The salt/pepper fried pork was really good. 8/10 authentic, just be aware there are a lot of garlic in the dish. The sweet and sour soup was excellent.   There are some other Customer ordered their sushi and I over heard them complaining the sushi, so I am guess they are pretty good too.  We will go back to try other stuff on the menu. Maybe sushi next time?  Hint, you need to ask for the Chinese menu. And it is writes in Chinese. So if you really want try but unable to understand, ask for help."}
{"text":"Sushi Tomo is a family owned restaurant with friendly staff and excellent food. I've been eating here for years and I've always had a good experience. Even compared to places found in NYC, its first rate. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great sushi I strongly recommend the caterpillar roll! Only had it 100 times this year.. And now they have the chefs special which is legit Asian cuisine that reminds me of home! And I'm amazed this place isn't packed 24/7 because the food is so delicious and fresh. The customer service here is 100% everyone is so polite and friendly!"}
{"text":"I've been to so many sushi restaurants in Pittsburgh, Boston, San Francisco, Miami, New York City, even Tokyo, and this place will always have a special place in my heart. Sushi Tomo's atmosphere is warm, inviting, and cozy. It's never over packed so you can hear yourself think and talk but there is always a steady flow of customers coming in. They have a full bar and I've even heard a patron say once, \"I only come in here for the drinks\" ... poor gal is missing out on life. The waitstaff is super friendly and the sushi is FRESH so what more could you want?"}
{"text":"Definitely not what I was expecting, coming in not knowing it was both a Chinese and Japanese restaurant. Ordered the chirashi and was surprised by the hot rice rather than the traditional Japanese vinegar rice, which in turn was slowly warming up the sashimi. Also, the sashimi cut was a little too thick. The restaurant started to incorporate Chinese style into Japanese dishes which I didn't like. The agedashi tofu we ordered was more like a stir fry Chinese dish rather than the usual Japanese appetizer.   Overall a very underwhelming experience, as sashimi for the same price is much better elsewhere in Pittsburgh. However this doesn't take anything away from the Chinese portion of the menu, as I didn't try any of it."}
{"text":"Lived in the north hills for 1.5 years about 1.5 miles away and never went here until tonight.  so good, the service was great and prices were reasonable. We got edamame, seaweed salad, 6 rolls (mainly speciality) and 2 large saki all for less than $100. Def will recommend to others and will go back many times to come."}
{"text":"Spring rolls really good   Wonton soup not real broth , poor quality   Fish tank is dirty . Why do Chinese people not clean aquariums ?  Food not spicy enough . Deep fried with batter ......not traditional recipes . My Kung pao was adulterated"}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in all of Pittsburgh ! The sushi is so incredibly fresh & the presentation is beautiful . Everything I have ever ordered has been amazing . There is something for everyone - even non-sushi lovers . I take everyone I know here without worry . The staff is so so friendly too . I could eat the age dashi tofu all day or the sunomono for lunch and dinner (no judgement - I have eaten here twice in one day before) . It's the absolute best !!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery tonight and it was pretty good. We had hot and sour soup, egg rolls, fried rice and Kung pao chicken. Food got here in a reasonable amount of time but it was just okay in my opinion. Not sure if I'd be back to be honest but food came hot and was super easy to order through uber eats."}
{"text":"OK so its in an old fast food place or so the building looks.  It is great and their Sushi is one of the two premiere Sushi houses in Pittsburgh (subjectively). No Hibachi but that is not what Japanese food is all about.  You will not be dissappointed, try the Hammer Roll"}
{"text":"My wife and i love this place. For the price, we think its the best in town. Good service, calm atmospher, and good food. Check it out for sure."}
{"text":"First and foremost, I high highly (and did I mention highly?) respect places that acknowledge their regulars.  It is the easiest way to get me to eat out of the palm of your hands.  This place is amazing.  I love their takosu and tuna tadaki.  I am also obsessed with their wasabi shaumi and the broiled yellowfin jaw.  Their rolls are also really good - I highly recommend the scallop roll, volcano roll, spider roll, and crazy tuna roll.  I also love their green tea."}
{"text":"While this is not my favorite sushi bar in Pittsburgh, it is a very good place, the fish is fresh, and the head sushi chef and owner is a great guy. Their salad w/ homemade ginger dressing is the best in the city. My favorite rolls are the Wedding Roll, and Crazy Tuna. They also do a Tiger Eye, which you don't see everywhere, and is a nice treat. And one of the best things about the place, is that they have Shabu Shabu, which is fresh veggies, noodles and thinly sliced meats that you cook yourself in a hot broth that's kept hot at the table. It's the most traditional Japanese way of eating, and so wonderful to see in Pittsburgh!  If you live in the N. Hills or are in the area, try this place out, you'll dig it!"}
{"text":"Why did I just discover this place?! It's a GREAT place to go to when you're craving for sushi. The lunch specials are such a good deal! We ordered the sushi lunch, sashimi lunch and the chicken katsu lunch. Each of them came with soup or salad. The sashimi was fresh and delicious. We actually enjoyed all the dishes which I was surprised. Our waiter was super nice and kept on top of things to make sure that we had everything. I would definitely come back and try the other items in the menu."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this place while in the Ross Park area recently.  Very happy we did.  I was extremely satisfied with both the appetizers and my main meal.  Also, the place has a really unique vibe that made for an authentic experience.  For appetizers we had the vegetable gyoza (dumplings), the mushroom soup, and the salad with ginger dressing.  I thought the gyoza were great.  They are not steamed and have some crunch here, but that is how I prefer them.  The soup and salad were also good, pretty close to your standard hibachi soup and salad.  For my meal I had the spicy crab roll and the spicy tuna roll.  They were both perfectly crafted and had a delicious flavor.  They had a good kick but were not overbearing.  On top of the great flavor, they were leery large in size.  I couldn't finish them all, so I have a great lunch to look forward to tomorrow.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a Nice Spot with excellent service and Good Food! Some of the best \"Amazing Chicken\" I have had! Nice hot and Crispy with the perfect blend of spice. The Sushi is ok but and to be fair it's above average than most places locally"}
{"text":"I had a satisfactory experience here. After living in Philly, I haven't been blown away by many sushi places here in Pittsburgh. This place seems like a typical, affordable suburb sushi option.  For our party of four, we ordered two different versions of the sushi platter for two. This included the rock & roll (4) tuna roll (6) flying fish roe (2) shrimp (2) McKnight roll (4) California roll (6) salmon roe (2) and squid (2). The platters also came with an option of soup (miso or chicken) and salad (ginger or sesame) for each person.   It turned out to be a lot more sushi than the 4 of us could eat! We stuffed ourselves and still had pieces we could not finish. Next time I would go with a smaller (and cheaper!!) option. I would have preferred to order and share a few different specialty rolls rather than have the mostly sashimi that we received. Lesson learned for next time!  We also had some hot saki and beer which complimented the meal very nicely. The service was great. Everything came out in a very timely manner and our server took wonderful care of us. I would definitely give this place another try."}
{"text":"I ordered the sushi lunch special. It came with a tuna roll, one piece of red tuna, one salmon, one shrimp, one crab, and one 'white fish' which may have been red snapper or mackerel. I ordered a salad with it. The dressing was way too sweet. The rice was not well seasoned. Not enough vinegar (if any). The white fish was very tough. These are common issues at sushi places like this. The salmon and tuna nigiri were at least tender and well treated. Don't think I'll be back for sushi, but maybe katsu."}
{"text":"I've been living in Pittsburgh for a little over a year now and have hesitated to review Sushi Tomo, even though it was one of the first sushi bars I tried in the city. I've found most of the other places here to be wildly inconsistent (Chaya, New Dumpling House, Sushi Kim...to name a few). I was just waiting for Sushi Tomo to let me down as well. That day has yet to come.  Sushi Tomo has consistently good food and consistently good service. The prices are totally reasonable, too. The Caterpillar Roll and Volcano Roll are my favorites of the special rolls, and of note is the fact that the sashimi platters are reliably fresh. Tomo is absolutely my sushi go-to."}
{"text":"To be totally honest I was in the area to take a friend to the sushi place across the street but (unfortunately for them they had a fire) it was closed.  After a quick yelp I saw there was Sushi Tomo across the street had good reviews so we gave it a try.  I'm wary of new sushi places (lived in Hawaii for 4 years and have been to Japan a few times) but I was so impressed with this place.  First of all there was a sushi bar.  I love those and if you haven't actually sat at one its an experience all to itself.  Try it sometime.  Unfortunately my friend wanted a booth, it happens.  We ordered the boat for one and some rolls to share and everything came out quickly, was presented properly and was very delicious.    Prices were reasonable as basic rolls started at $3-5 and the boat for one featuring a nice selection of a roll, sushi and sashimi was under $25.  The only knocks I can give are that the service was good but \"meh\".  Whitey waitress was super nice but young and not very knowledgable if even a little mousy.  All the fish was super fresh and the right color with the exception of the tuna, it was a little old and the texture and color showed that.  It happens though as we can't really hit an ocean with a stone from here.  Upsides:  reasonable prices, great atmosphere and presentation, huge selection of rolls, assumed chopstick usage, actual sushi bar, quick service, clean bathroom.  Downsides:  the buffet across the street is such a great value, service was good but \"meh\", tuna was a little old but the the rest of the fish was super fresh.  Overall if you like sushi this is a really good experience that won't break the bank.  Definitely give it a try."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Sushi Tomo and try to eat their once a week. I've tried sushi at other restaurants, and always return to Tomo.  Volcano roll is the best for me, but have ordered different meals on each visit, and each was very good. The \"sushi boat\" is exceptional. Prices are fair.  The staff and owner are courteous, knowledgeable and make me feel always welcomed.  Tomo is a must if you want fresh delicious sushi."}
{"text":"Not too sure about the sushi or the Chinese dishes, but the lunch specials are pretty worth it. They are not pricey at all, and they come in bento lunches, donburis, udon, and the like. Most of them are under $10, which is quite affordable considering they all come with salad and miso soup as well. We had the salmon and the unagidon (eel), both of which were delicious. Highly recommended to go along with any sushi you order!"}
{"text":"Good for Pittsburgh North Hills sushi.  We had the edamame, California Roll, Spicy Tuna, Allegheny Roll and steamed chicken and vegetables.  All prepared to our satisfaction and tasted great.  Would come back again."}
{"text":"I've been going here for over ten years, and I have tried most of their menu. I am of the opinion that this is the best sushi in the state, and I haven't been convinced otherwise yet. Modest environment (no annoying trendy cocktail chatter) relaxing atmosphere with beautiful music and decor, and the friendliest service I've had. Make it a stop, and sucker your anti-sushi friends into going with you - their non-sushi menu is just as good."}
{"text":"Great Japanese food. Great sushi. This is as good as it gets on McKnight Road. I highly recommend Sushi Tomo."}
{"text":"Great tasting spring rolls and garlic dipping sauce.  This was my first visit so it was difficult to  decide which one  of the chef's special dishes to order.  I chose  the shrimp and broccoli and my friend ordered the lemon chicken.  Our servings were large enough to share at least half of a plate and we still had leftovers to take home. The lemon chicken was an excellent choice and we were very pleased with the preparation of both meals.  Light oil and not overcooked.  The dining room is large and comfortable and they also offer seating along the sushi bar.  The owner and staff were very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to come here with a regular, which meant I knew the in's and out's of the menu before I sat down. I also came with a hungry group, meaning we got to sample quite a bit!  We had a selection of tempura, a sashimi platter, the BR7 roll, crazy tuna roll, volcano roll, and spider roll... after we started with a spicy tako salad and seaweed salad.  Everything was solid, with hats off to the BR7 and crazy tuna rolls.  If anything was just 'all-right' it was the sashimi platter.  The pieces were a nice cut, but I wasn't thrilled with the types of fish they included.  Service was friendly and everything came out super prompted.  No so prompted that you felt rushed, but no so slow that you started to get full before the next wave.  I'd recommend Sushi Tomo for those in the area and will make a return visit on a future trip!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate me purchasing a new car with my boyfriend  The place was nice and cozy smaller than I thought but I noticed a nice mix of diverse people were all sitting around enjoying them selves. We looked over the menu and knew we wanted sushi so we got the Tomo boat for two, wonton soup, hot & sour soup, and stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer.  So we started off with the soups which I got the wonton soup which was delicious the broth was nice and flavorful and it has to wontons in it. Perfect size to start with.  Next we dove into the stuffed mushrooms which I have to say I was a little disappointed in. They were cooked perfectly but the stuffing was hard to taste and it was covered in a sweet sauce almost like a general tso sauce. It was an interesting combo but I didn't like the fact that the seafood stuffing wasn't coming through.  But the lay resistance was the boat it has a nice variety of tunas, red snapper, and salmon. Mixed among them were a tuna roll and California roll. It was scrumptious! I always gauge my sushi by the raw tuna and theirs was really good.  Overall I had a nice experience can not wait to try different things from the menu"}
{"text":"Sushi Tomo is a Chinese and Japanese restaurant- if you are like me, that description alone will make you hesitant. However, this place is A-OK.  We tried some apps- Agedashi Tofu, Gyoza and the Tempura Squid Rings. The agedashi tofu was just deep fried tofu with a thick shoyu sauce- I'm used to the more lightly fried and delicate tofu with light shoyu. The gyoza was fine- no complaints. The tempura squid rings came with a dipping sauce that was too mild, and we ended up dipping the rings in the gyoza sauce. The tempura batter was lacking salt.  As for the maki we ordered- everything was fine. We tried the Wedding Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, Salmon Roll, Spider Roll, and California Roll. Another person got the Unagi-don.   There is plenty of seating in the restaurant and a decent size parking lot."}
{"text":"I think the sushi at Sushi Tomo is the best in Pittsburgh. Always extremely fresh and prepared beautifully, with creative options. Geisha roll is my absolute favorite, but everything I've eaten here has been really good. The owner and staff are wonderful and make us feel like VIPs every time we are there. I'm not an expert in saki, but their house hot saki is great - especially appreciated after a long day at work.  From the outside, the restaurant doesn't look like much, but the inside is comfortable, pleasant and clean. The staff gives the place a warm vibe. The sushi chefs really care about preparing an artful dish and it always appears that they enjoy what they're doing - a good sign!  I'm so glad that Sushi Tomo is on the way home from downtown for me. It's always a treat to make a stop!"}
{"text":"PROS:  Mouthwatering sashimi. The squid was zesty, the texture firm and rewarding. Both the California and Alaskan rolls were EXCELLENT. The caviar was divine. Cozy booths in a traditional setting, with the sushi chef in plain view. The price was reasonable - around $5 per item.  CONS: The menu. Why does the menu not stay open? Folding back the pages of this menu is like curling a 10-lb weight. Also, the salmon sashimi was a bit bland.  If not for the menu, this sushi would have scored a perfect 5/5 clams. As it were, 4.5/5 clams. - TV"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite sushi places to go to on a week night but the quality of the food has really gone down hill. I pretty much go to Tokyo across the street anymore."}
{"text":"This is my go-to sushi joint! I'm constantly either bringing clients here for a quite lunch to discuss business, or grabbing a couple quick sushi rolls to-go. Typically on the quite side, complimented by polite employees. 8 for taste, 8 for service, 6-7 for atmosphere."}
{"text":"There's a reason I come here frequently: Although I generally don't get \"phenom\" sushi here, it's never bad. As in never. The quality refuses to dip below satisfactory no matter how many times I go back and forth.   I've been to sushi kim twice. The first time was great, the second time was terrible. You can't serve terrible sushi; that shit cray spensive.   Tomo i luv u"}
{"text":"Third time must be a charm.  A couple weeks ago my husband and I struck out at Hal's Bar & Grill (too long of a wait for a table) and Hop House (smoking inside) before we headed to Sushi Tomo for dinner.  We had a great meal with prompt, friendly service.  Ordered 4 specialty rolls and enjoyed them all.  Good ingredients, and the price and portion were just about right.  Icing on the cake?  To the Entertainment members out there, Tomo rocks a pretty good coupon!  Simple interior.  Nothing special there.  We'll be back again and again, I promise."}
{"text":"Sushi Tomo has to be one of my favorite Sushi restaurants in Pittsburgh. Always seem to find incredibly fresh fish (for Pittsburgh), the chefs are knowledgeable, and the owner/manager is wonderfully friendly.  Their cooked Japanese food is very good, but not as wide in selection or quality as Chaiya. That said, I don't think Chaiya's sushi is as good as Tomo's."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've dined at Sushi Tomo, so when my date suggested going here for sushi I figured what the heck. Conveniently located on busy McKnight road, this restaurant is the perfect spot to hit up after a long day of shopping in the area, but keep in mind that the entrance is only accessible to traffic heading north on McKnight Road.   Date and I order a pot of green tea, edamame, and four rolls. While I found the rolls to be tasty, but nothing special, I was really disappointed with the edamame - although it tasted fine, it didn't look fresh. Also, I can't recall eating edamame without some sort of salt already on them when they arrive at the table. Granted, my heart was probably thankful that they lacked all that extra sodium, but I've found salt really adds something to otherwise dull edamame.   I'm glad we went here, but I'm going to continue sticking to grabbing sushi from Little Tokyo (South Side) or Andy's at Wholey's Market in the Strip District."}
{"text":"I went here on a lunch break with my coworkers and it was wonderful! They ordered a traditional pork dish off the Chinese menu while I coyly ordered a lunch box from the English menu. (It's hard to read Chinese!)   Anyway, the fish katsu was amazing, and so was the mystery fried pork dish.  I wish this restaurant was closer to the city but eitherway, I'd definitely make the trip out here."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! From the absolutely delicious teriyaki to the super fresh sushi, you can't go wrong. My favorite place on Mcknight Road hands down!!!"}
{"text":"This is VERY authentic and you get a lot for your money. The owner is ALWAYS there and he seems to great every customer. Very friendly atmosphere and good service. The non-sushi items are excellent as well."}
{"text":"The menu is jam packed with many different options and everything I ever tried was great.  The only problem for me is that they don't really have any options for kids."}
{"text":"Not bad! I was recently here for a business dinner, and had some mixed feelings when I read about the place. I'm always skeptical of the Chinese restaurant / Sushi bar combination, because I've had some scary experiences with that.  That being said, I felt that my sushi was definitely a solid experience here - No, it's not the same as being in Japan or even NYC, but I will say that the place is definitely worth a trip if you are in the vicinity. Service was fast and friendly, and the restaurant was clean and organized.  Fish and rice quality were good, and I would certainly come back if I had a hankering for sushi while at Ross Park or another place nearby."}
{"text":"Good service. Good staff. Good sushi.  Hey folks, it's Pittsburgh and 4 starts for Sushi is worth driving for! I'd come back."}
{"text":"Has a cool vibe, just rhe right balance between casual and formal interior, and tasty rolls.  Their speciality rolls are especially tasty.  Japanese beers are reasonably priced as are vast majority of their rolls.  Only complaint was that Siri couldn't find the right location.  Lol, on the back end, some squirrels may have been squirreling around."}
{"text":"I constantly drive up and down McKnight Rd and disregarded this place. I think mostly because it had sushi in the name, and I am not much of a sushi eater. I finally took a look closer and checked out the menu and saw other items that I love. I visited to check out what I've been missing after all of this time. Sushi Tomo is a cute and low key hidden jewel. I had the Amazing Chicken and Eggroll. And it was amazing. The chicken is so fresh and delicious. My only gripe was the egg roll was very salty tasting. Although, I still liked it...my blood pressure probably didn't.  Will I stop back here again? Yes!  This is a great place for a date night that isn't over the top, but still cute and quaint at the same time.  Next time, I plan to check out the Lo Mein."}
{"text":"Sushi Tomo has the best Sushi in Pittsburgh hands down.  I've been going there for the last 10 years!  I'm having them cater my wedding reception and make a bunch of Sushi for the Cocktail hour."}
{"text":"Due to a severe shortage of sushi options in the north hills, this place is pretty much our only option (not counting scary buffets). Luckily, it's good. Friendly staff, fresh sushi, lots of good rolls. Recommend."}
{"text":"amazing menu selection. they sort the menu by lunch and then by meat, weight watchers, fried rice/lomein, etc. very kind staff and food tastes great."}
{"text":"As an expatriate of Pittsburgh, Sushi Tomo has been a former weekly haunt of mine.  I think for sushi it is an excellent value and has a good sushi bar.  I have posted the main chef's photo (a little dated), but I thought he was a good sushi chef and decent conversationalist if you sit at the bar.  I think most of creative sushi is well done.  The seating is a little dated, but has always been clean, and the service has been fine.  It took no time to become a regular and become recognized easily for comps and other good service."}
{"text":"Tomo is better than Chaya??? Wow, I never would expect to hear that! My boyfriend's sister came to visit us a couple of months ago and after doing some internet research, we decided to try Tomo out.   We ordered sushi for take out and I have to say that the wait staff was very pleasant when we picked up our food. The sushi however, wasn't as good as i had been expecting. The rolls were a bit large for my taste, the rice to fish ratio was off (too much rice, too little fish), and the fish wasn't as fresh as I would have hoped. The sushi wasn't horrible by any means, but Sushi Tomo is certainly not the best that you can get in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Food is good but the service is questionable at best!  I ordered sushi, my family ordered from the kitchen.  They were done eating before I even received my food.  I always tip the sushi guys before the meal out of habit, since it will often ensure prompt service.  I was seriously tempted to take my tip back.  That was ridiculous!"}
{"text":"I've heard good things about this place, but I have eaten my share of Asian cuisine around pittsburgh and other cities around the country and I was not impressed. I ordered the spicy California which was cool. And I ordered the teriyaki shrimp and was a little disappointed. It's not the typical dish you get when you request teriyaki. The sauce was thin and runny. I am used to a browner thicker sauce. And the shrimp  and thinly sliced mushrooms were sitting on a bed of sprouts. It didn't taste all that bad but just wasn't something I would ever order again. There was a side salad as well with ginger dressing, again, wasn't bad just wasn't what I expected. I'm normally would have ordered a salad with the ginger dressing and received a thicker textures dressing, this wasn't that at all. Was runnier. I may try the restaurant one more time and order something else just to make sure. This was take out.  You would hope it would be the same quality but I'll try it again dining in."}
{"text":"Their sushi, miso soup, and seaweed salads are tasty.    I always get the asparagus tempura rolls and shrimp tempura rolls.  The reason I deducted one star is because although the rolls are yummy, the size of the shrimp tempura rolls is way too large.   It's difficult and embarrassing trying to stick a piece in my mouth.   A piece of sushi should be popped into your mouth all at once, and not so big that you look ridiculous for a minute trying to chew it.  Seaweed salads always calm my tummy and I order them every time they're available at a restaurant.  Sushi Tomo has a good seaweed salad but the portion is smaller than that of any other sushi restaurant (and the price does not positively reflect the smaller size).  There are also cut up cucumber strips at the bottom of the salad which is deceptive because when you first get the order, you think the bowl is filled with seaweed when in fact it's a lot of cucumber at the bottom.  (The cucumber is tasty but it's not what I want in a seaweed salad.)  They  have plenty of other Asian dishes available for those who do not like sushi."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place, but my friend was feeling the need for noodles, so I said heck yeah.  We shared the tempura shrimp and the yaki udon.  Both were very good.  They came with soup and salad.  The noodles in the udon were delicious, thick and full of flavor.  I can see why my friend was craving them!"}
{"text":"Our experience this Thursday was phenomenal. Liz our server was nothing our than exceptional. From the moment we entered the establishment till the moment we left, she was upbeat, flexible, and most importantly--kind. My family and I have enjoyed coming to this restaurant for years, but this service with Liz was one for the books. Keep it up Liz, you're one of a kind."}
{"text":"My friends and I come here a ton and love it. The quality of sushi is top notch. This particular incident, the chefs used an avocado that was browning and our waitress pointed it out, apologized, and offered to remedy the situation immediately. Talk about great customer service! The only issue was she forgot the ikura we ordered but no biggie because we were full. Definitely going to come back because the food and service is amazing."}
{"text":"From the outside this place looks like a run down Asian restaurant, but don't judge this book by the cover. Inside isn't much to speak of either with its tacky Asian decorations. Sushi Tomo is a top player in Pittsburgh's sushi scene.   My first time here I had three rolls, spicy salmon, spicy tuna, and a dragon roll, an order of seaweed salad and Saki. These are no little rolls, these would have filled up any Pittsburgh steel worker after a double shift. The rice was perfectly cooked, sticky and delicious, the salmon and tuna perfectly aged and flavorful. The sauces delicately drizzled over each roll, normally added to please the eye, also pleased my palate, adding a zingy creaminess to these Japanese works of art. The seaweed salad was good, but I've never had a bad one.  My second visit was for lunch, as I was alone, I sat at the sushi bar. Remembering my first foray at Sushi Tomo, I only ordered 2 rolls, being a salmon freak I had the spicy salmon again and asked the chef if he worked with salmon skin. He made me a delicious salmon skin roll with the fatty belly as the main protein in the middle of the roll. It was delicious and to guild the Lilly, he topped each piece with salmon eggs. As if the fatty belly and crispy salmon skin wasn't enough richness, the salmon eggs  added even more creamy richness to each piece. It was an epicurean delight, a mixture of textures and temperatures. Warm rice, crispy salmon skin, cool salmon belly, and the creamy salmon eggs. Just a touch of soy sauce for that wonderful umami earthiness. This was a work of culinary art. I hope this roll is on the menu, I'd order two of them, although I'd just have the salmon eggs on one of the rolls, as their richness became tiresome to my palate.   Great place, even if the outside could use sprucing up, but in life we find these are the hidden gems that normally we'd pass up."}
{"text":"We have been enjoying Sushi Tomo for at least the past seven years and the quality of the sushi has been consistent. The waitstaff is ridiculously attentive and welcoming. Our favorite rolls include the Tomo Roll (shrimp tempura with eel sauce and avocado) , the Volcano Roll (shrimp tempura with spicy mayo and spicy salmon) and the spicy salmon or tuna hand roll. The spicy tako salad (octopus in a spicy mayo sauce) is a MUST! It is our favorite sushi in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Yep - I think this has become my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh for sushi. My first experience was just an Alaskan Roll for takeout and it was fabulous. The fish was fresh and the nori wasn't tough, but tender.   I had probably driven past this place a thousand times and never gave it a second look. It's actually easy to drive by on McKnight. It's next to a small shopping plaza and the sign isn't very noticeable. But reading reviews here on Yelp convinced me to give it a shot.  My second experience, me and Mr. J went in for dinner. I had the stir fried soba noodles, veggies, and shrimp and it was very good! The portion was large and I couldn't even finish it all. The dish had a nice variety of veggies and plenty of shrimp!  This time I had a Magic Roll which was a spicy tuna roll with avocado and eel sauce. Again, amazing freshness and flavor...even Mr. J ate a few pieces and he \"doesn't like\" sushi!    The interior is tastefully decorated in traditional Japanese style and the staff is very friendly. We had great service and our drinks were always full.  I think he's going to get sick of me wanting to come here so much!!"}
{"text":"Prior to eating here, I have only had sushi at Giant Eagle so I have been meaning to try a real sushi joint for a long time and I am so glad I chose this one! Their sushi is very fresh and delicious, they prepare it right up front behind glass. The service was fast and friendly. The drinks come in large glasses and there's soy sauce in cute little teacups at every table! I don't have much of anything negative to say other than the parking lot having some potholes and the interior being a little dated. But I enjoyed this place so much that I want to go back ASAP and try all of the different sushi on the menu!"}
{"text":"If you love sushi this is the place to go near Ross Park Mall. Good price good food. Clean. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Yum. Immediately greeted by waitress which I like. Prices very reasonable and I had a sushi platter A for one which was really fresh and great quality. Rolls were great also and w nice size. I will definitely go back. Miso soup was really great as well!"}
{"text":"I was here a few weeks ago on a saturday when I had a craving for sushi and this was the most convenient spot on the way to the mall.  There really isn't a lot to be said about the space itself.  You walk in there is a sushi bar directly in front of you and a small bar to the side with a tv.  There are plenty of booths and several 4 tops.  The specials are listed on a chalkboard as you walk in and I was pleased to see that it was the season for sockeye salmon and they had this option.  We were seated quickly by a young lady at a booth who walked us through some of the \"specials\".  I was a bit disappointed with the sake options as far as I could tell they only had two and I don't believe the girl knew too much about either.  I ordered a cold sake.  It was served in a bottle and was pretty good. I don't remember the name, but I think it was the more expensive option of the two.  Annie ordered a vodka/tonic... the usual.  Annie ordered the katsudon with a side of terryaki (sp?) sauce.  It arrived relatively quickly and was huge.  It was very moist chicken quick friend and served over rice.  The price was only $8 and she was very pleased with this option.  I also was surprised at the quality and portion of this simple lunch.  I started with the sake salmon sashimi appetizer.  It was quite good served with some type of spicy sauce and cut with a few sprinkles of micro cut jalepeno.  The spiciness of the jalepeno cut the richness of the sockeye well.  My only complaint is that I was a bit surprised at the $20 pricetag for this light lunch appetizer.  I didn't ask the price, but the waitress may do well next time to mention this to a customer.  It wasn't what I would expect for lunch appetizer casual dining.  I also ordered an assortment of sashimi.  Overall I was not overwhelmed by the quality of the fish or how the sashimi was cut.  I was happy to see they had toro, but again wasn't too pleased with the cut.  Overall this is a perfectly adequate spot to grab some sushi, wih a surprisingly large assortment of fish.  I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but I would go back again."}
{"text":"From the quality of the miso soup to the fish itself, this place is consistently one of the very best places to get sushi in metro Pittsburgh.  I seem to order the boat for two whenever I go.  I have never in over 7 years had a bad plate of sushi or sashimi!  The owner clearly cares about the quality of what he serves.  The decor and lighting needs a makeover however.  The bathrooms are ok, but not always spic and span.  The service is usually friendly, but sometimes kind of slow if they are at or near capacity.  I wish I could have given this place 5 stars, but aspects other than the food are not as great as the food."}
