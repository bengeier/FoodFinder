{"text":"Quite simply, my favorite bar in Pittsburgh. I thought maybe one day I would grow tired of ice cold pitchers of Bud Light and delicious Buffalo Wings (or Spicy Ranch. Or Kitchen Sink...). Alas, I have not. Bartenders and waitresses are great and very friendly. Always have the good games on. The back patio is a nice touch and will be great in the summer. All the funky memorabilia gives it a true Pittsburgh feel. If I ever go missing, I'm probably there playing darts."}
{"text":"A bit of a hipster hole in the wall, this place has incredible food.  The atmosphere is college frat, but the food is for real.  Two words.  Philly cheesesteak.   You must have one.  It is the rival of any you might find in our sister to the east.   Tony Luke, Pat, Geno, Jim:  You have a real competitor in Shadyside!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to see grey cup on television.  The bar tender (a heavier fellow in a 7 shirt) refused to show the game for the next two hours, as absolutely every television was occupied with the same game.  (I then had to drive down to the waterfront to Dave&Busters to see the game, and they happily obliged). As well, it is a sports oriented bar, but the sound is neither set high enough to hear, or low enough to carry on a conversation.  Did not order food, as the window view into the kitchen did not promote delicious or even decent quality food.  Highly unlikely that i will return."}
{"text":"The William Penn Tavern is just a good place to have a cheap, decent beer, some light bar food, and catch a Pittsburgh sports game.  The place is usually packed with sports fans for any Pirates, Penguins or Steelers game.    The three dollar signs are totally busted.  It should be one dollar sign.  I got two 12 oz microbrews, six hot wings and an entree for $16, which in my opinion is cheap as hell.  The wings come in all kinds of varieties of sauces.  No matter what kind of flavor, they will be nestled in a pool of grease, I promise.  My personal favorite is the \"Kitchen Sink\" which has notes of chili, garlic, parmesean and maybe even Ginger.  Just the right amount of spice, and far more grease than necessary.  Hey, they're only 40 cents each on Tuesdays.  Pass on the food, enjoy the atmosphere.  I sat at the bar in between a homeless Vietnam Vet (who counted out the 40 cent wings bill in change) and two Chinese engineers working on some big project for Carnegie Mellon, while Pirates fans all around shouted at the screen because their baseball team sucks.  My kinda clientele, basically."}
{"text":"Our favorite place in Shadyside! The staff is friendly and quick. Must order the kitchen sink wings and fried mac and cheese bites - heaven."}
{"text":"Your bouncers need to learn how to read government issued ID's and have respect for their customers. I went to will penn on Friday night and the bouncer was so rude to me, I am over twenty one with a real government issued drivers license and the bouncer told me to \"get out\" because he thought I was under aged. He was grilling me with questions of my birthdate and my height and being extremely rude to me. He told me to \"get out\" in the rudest tone possible. Just because I'm Asian and look young, doesn't mean I'm under twenty one. Will penn needs to learn how to treat people with respect and take classes on how to read government issues ID's. All you are doing is hurting yourself by turning away customers that are actually twenty one and making people not want to come to your establishment by being extremely rude."}
{"text":"You get \"bang for your buck\", great wings and friendly staff.  Angus burger and zucchini planks never disappoint!  Outdoor patio great for smoker clientele."}
{"text":"Great local bar. Phenomenal wings and beer specials. Great staff and a must visit for local tourist."}
{"text":"Bombbbbbbbbb A wings.  Cheap and tasty how we like it. Nice bartenders and speedy service. Decent beer specials. Only thing it's missing is a pinball machine.  Definitely will make this a regular spot!"}
{"text":"Great place to drink cheap beer, but it gets way too crowded.  This place is a college bar that people of all ages go to. The beer is cheap and the food is cheap also, but surprisingly good for cheap bar food.  My only complaint is how crowded it can get... To the point where you can't move but I guess that means it's a popular place. They have an outdoor patio in the back"}
{"text":"Bartender put a xanax in my drink. Thankfully I saw before my night was ruined. Chargers are pending."}
{"text":"Haven't tried the wings yet, will try next time. Went there two days in a roll for drinks. Like the patio because it' s nice weather."}
{"text":"I ordered food takeout on Sunday Feb 26th from William Penn Tavern in Shadyside. I have always loved it here but today the I am writing about the service aspect side of things.  I recently had foot surgery and am using crutches. The one guy working there actually opened the doors for me. Then when leaving the same guy offered to walk the order out to my car for me. I usually don't expect this service but under the  circumstances the offer was accepted gladly! The chicken cheesesteak is the best in the city and will def be back again! Thanks again William Penn."}
{"text":"We love this place ... dependable food, generous pours but most of all, the nicest staff in the city ... bar none!! Try the wings for sure ... always a great choice. But look at the specials board for inventive alternatives to the regular fare. A neighborhood classic!"}
{"text":"Are you looking for cheap beer (and possibly good wings) in Shadyside?  If so, then this is the place for you.  They have some of the best deals on pitchers and buckets (typically domestics), but if you are looking for a few drinks with a couple of friends, this is definitely your spot.  It's relaxed and doesn't typically get too crowded during the week, but even if it does, the bartenders will get everyone drinks quickly while still being friendly and fun.    The menu isn't too bad either, but in most cases, I only stick with the wings as it's definitely just bar food!"}
{"text":"Great food and normally great atmosphere, but today thus music was the nastiest hardcore rap that was just offensive. How many F-bombs can you realistically listen to while eating lunch and watching sports. Dropped 2 stars from what I would last night whenit used to be my favorite place in shadyside."}
{"text":"I agree with others who have mentioned the kitchen sink wings.  They are really good and I would keep coming back for them alone.  They have a nice tv set up and always have the games on.  Beer selection could be better, although they have about 8 taps with 2-3 craft options.  Apart from the wings I have tried the cheese steak which was pretty good.  One of the drawbacks of William Penn is that seating can be hard to come by, and there isn't really a great place to stand unless you want to go outside to the patio.  Service has always been good and the prices are great."}
{"text":"\"Good For Dancing: No\"  Although not the typical place to go dancing as the place is pretty small, the music here is so good that it makes my friends and I dance each time we come here. A place that allows some dancing is an automatic 5-star bar. In addition though, food was pretty good and service was great, and I promise I'm not saying that just because our server was very attractive. I don't come to Shadyside often, but when I do, this is my go-to place."}
{"text":"If you're drunk get the kitchen sink wings and mac & cheese bites! Their fried zucchini is pretty good too :)"}
{"text":"Wing night special! 50 cent wings Thursday nights - and I would recommend the kitchen sink sauce (a perfect blend of buffalo, BBQ and garlic parm). Also, $2.50 Miller lite 22oz drafts.  Some wings were normal size, and others were kind of rinky-dink - which I guess that is why there is a special.  This seems like a fun place to drink and chill. It slowly got busier as the night went on."}
{"text":"Great beer and food specials.  They had the Michigan game on too!"}
{"text":"Once again stopped in after an appointment in Shadyside to grab some wings. The waitress I had last time was there again and we both recalled the last time I was in Once again she was deftly managing bar tending and waiting tables single handedly ( last time it was a booming Saturday). Her friendliness and bubbly manner adds to people returning! Music playing on the juke box with a large variety of choices   The food was freshly cooked and portions were good. Wings come with a variety of sauces (which I sampled 2,) both good and the fries were straight out of the fryer, all of this with great service (thanks Abby!). I look forward to returning when in the area again. I give it 4 1/2 stars!!"}
{"text":"I hate sports bars. I don't like a bar w too many tvs but this bar won me over. Bear the owner is just an OG and so nice. It's so friendly and nice. The food is really good. Man for bar eats and friend food - I love it. I crave it some days. The wings. Prob my favorite in the city. It's my go to when I want fried stuff I have to say. Haha. I cool fresh yummy food at home all the time and get foodie but when I go here it's all fried up goodness and comfort food. Yum! My husband goes here everyday for lunch almost since he works over there and for years. It's mega local at lunch and people are loyal. If this place ever closed I'd be bummed. It's one of those great small businesses/ bars that's warm and bear the owner is a gem. He knows everyone's name and this bar is no fuss no muss. Nothing fancy but warmness and good food every time. Thanks bear!"}
{"text":"\"Eek! Methinks not.\" is the fuck right, random yelp review classifications. Well, congratulations William Penn Tavern, you bloody did it! My friend is currently in the bathroom of his 1 bedroom Shady Side apartment throwing up while I get this review started. Bra-fucking-vo! The wings we just had were made of some hybrid of memory foam, decayed chicken remains, and sadness.   We decided to try both conventional and off the walls flavors, including buffalo, thai chili, and the kitchen sink.  Well, the wings I got were tossed in buffalo sauce. And by tossed, I mean someone painted a wall and and grabbed a handful of breaded dogshit \"chicken wings\" and threw a fastball at the wall, which is the only way they could've been covered in sauce as poorly as they were.  Now let's transition to the tavern's more 'exotic' sauce, Thai Chili. Have you ever had something stuck in the back of your throat that you couldn't get to disappear no matter how much water you drank? Envision that same feeling persisting for ~45 minutes, regardless of how much else you ate/drank/puked. That is thai chili. It's sweet enough to be in the same caliber as a Mike n' Ike, but terrible enough to be that drunk uncle everyone ignores at Christmas. Would never recommend. My soul is still bleeding.  Now, let's get to menu item availability. (And we ordered a whole 3 things, so it's not like we were testing the menu). We asked for a humble serving of tater tots, and we waited with excitement while the chef prepared our pre-meal feast. Roughly 12 minutes after ordering, approximately the time it takes to prepare tots, our waitress stopped over at our table. Instead of being greeted with our crispy tots, we were greeted with the awful news that they \"ran out of tots\". If i was a larger fan of 'Napoleon Dynamite', I most likely would have blown a gasket. However, I calmly waited for my Sodexo brand fries to be delivered, unevenly seasoned, to my table.  I sat, aghast at my lack of tots, and dipped my fries into some cheese that I may only describe as similar to what you may purchase at your step-daughter's youth soccer game that you are not nearly as invested as you should be in. Especially since that bitch ex-wife managed to gain 70% custody of Samantha. What the hell. Note to you folks: don't trust Yelp reviews when you're seeking legal consultation.   I would more quickly advise you to binge drink alcohol for 3 hours straight and reconsider the last woman you loved while pointing a gun to the temple of your head, than I would for you to stop in at William Penn Tavern for a plate of buffalo covered dolphin shit."}
{"text":"So a few things really stand out for me at this bar. Been there a few times now, it's definitely a favorite local hangout. I happen to be in the family of fans of the kitchen sink flavor of their wings. Like others who have commented, the crave will creep up at random times. Most places I'm used to have A wing night, they have 4!   Flavors tried: 1- honey cajun- has real honey, 1/5 heat 2- voodoo- an amped up bbq/ hot/ kitchen sink type of sauce in that it's got an unspecified number of ingredients, 5/5 heat (caution fiery hot!) 3- thai chili- alright, not much thai or chili flavor in my opinion but passable, 1/5 heat 4- spicy ranch- good flavor, 2/5 heat Try mixing them up! voodoo with honey combo is gooood... Look forward to trying the other flavors. Yes it's packed, but we always manage to find a table. Service is good, the waitresses are very friendly and attentive. The juke or the bar'J plays good to exceptional ol'school hip hop, alternative, rock, 80s.. you name it. Have heard very obsolete tunes by Biggie, Tupac that most have never heard, that's some music nerdiness I dig. I see a mixed crowd everytime, not just millenials. There is an outdoor space in back, where smokers can do their thing. Overall, great place to catch the game, eat some wings, have some beers, listen to good tunes, and chill ;) Now what is in that kitchen sink sauce?! I've got it narrowed down to garlic, parmesan, soy, some tomato product... so much more, I will figure you out!"}
{"text":"Ok, I'm joining the band wagon too...  I love the kitchen sink wings!  To be honest, I never even heard of such a thing.  I was expecting it to be a platter of wings with random food on top of it.  I would have ate that too.  The kitchen sink wings were absolutely delicious.  The wings were piping hot, amazing flavor.  You got your spicy, little sweet, and Parmesan cheese all mixed up in there.  Lots of flavor!  I devoured them.    I came here during lunch, only a few folks at the bar. I liked the atmosphere, definitely a sports place.   The prices are very reasonable.  Great amazing service, good beer and the most delicious wings I have ever consumed in my life.  I'm dead serious.  Even if you're just visiting the area, stop by.  I'm sure glad I did."}
{"text":"A typical sports bar in Shadyside. I've only been here once a couple years ago, but from what I remember the beer selection was pretty good, and the quality of the food is about par. To be honest, I prefer watching the game elsewhere, hence why I haven't been back. However, I'd recommend a stop-in sometime to see if the place and vibe tickle your fancy."}
{"text":"Why is there no music????? It's silent in here.....not ok. People are having a few drinks in legit silence. Not ok."}
{"text":"Probably the worst bar in Shadyside to go on Friday/Saturday nights. Waaay too crowded and loud. The clientele sucks - it's people in their mid to late-20's desperately trying to cling onto their college years by being loud and obnoxious.   It does have a nice back patio that is heated during the winter and smoking is permitted, which is nice. If you are there on a week night, it might not be so bad.  Drink prices aren't anything special and cocktails aren't that strong.  I'd venture a guess that this is a good hang-out spot during sporting events. It feels very sports-bar oriented.  I would say this is a good bar to go with a large drunk group, and that's it. If you are by yourself or in a small group, Cappy's or Mardi Gras would be much better IMO."}
{"text":"Yes, 5 stars. Albeit my friend and I were only there till about 10pm on a Saturday, however I was blown away.  The wait staff is phenomenal. The bartenders are very nice and quick on their feet. The wings are out of this world.  It certainly does have the sights of a dive bar from the outside, however once you get inside you are greeted by NOT the stench of stale cigarettes, broke dreams, and a wet dream of a Johnny Cash fan. Instead I was greeted by a bar tender asking me if I wanted a drink. I was greeted by the hard wood flooring and the very nice stairs and banister. And it was clean.  It's honestly an all around good place to be. Not too loud, however at 10pm it definitely because more of a party location. Shot girls came in hosting Jose Cuervo or something, the music was turned from a subtle 3 to a not imposing, but definitely audible 7, and again, the wings, man. They were just the bees knees.  The 2 things that suck about this place are the bathrooms and parking. Unless you can hoof it, you have to park 3 blocks away to find free parking, which is pretty lame. And the bathroom (at least for the guys) doesn't have a lock so if you wish to go number 2, bring a friend to stand by the door. Also, no mirror which I thought was more quirky than odd.  I highly recommend this place and look forward to returning to it."}
{"text":"Good Food, Good Beers, Better Prices.  Try the Patio outback, you'll love it."}
{"text":"Cheap beer specials, a no-frills atmostphere, and standard pub grub abound. There are plenty of TVs all over the place. It gets packed like a sardine can on weekends. You can't escape the Pittsburgh memorabilia. William Penn Tavern is Shadyside's very own hybrid of sports bar and college bar.  Without a doubt, the highlight would be the chicken wings. The 50-cent wing special (which happens FOUR days a week!) is one of the most affordable and delicious ways to stuff yourself silly. They come doused with your choice of many sauces. The wings are juicy, tasty, and humongous. They might come from giant chickens that could terrorize a city Godzilla-style. I cannot recommend the kitchen sink and spicy ranch sauces enough. If indeed \"you are what you eat,\" there's a good chance I will soon turn into a William Penn Tavern chicken wing.  Other tidbits: The beer selection isn't the greatest--it's the standard Yuengling/Miller/Coors/Bud alongside a handful of craft brews--but at least the cheap beer is actually fairly cheap. There's a dartboard and a foosball table for when you get competetive. The NFL satellite package makes this a great place to spend Sunday afternoons during football season. The patio is decent, and has heaters and a tent for less-than-ideal weather.  William Penn, being his Quaker self, likely wouldn't appreciate it, but if you want some cheap beer, tasty bar food, and a game to watch, this tavern with his name is a solid option."}
{"text":"This place is home, excellent food, excellent service, and the greatest bar atmosphere in all of Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Nice place to go for a decently priced beer, or pitcher, with bar food. Plenty of sports action on the screens.  Decently sized, with a cool outdoor seating area.   No pretension or need for it.   I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to stop by and grab a beer at. The staff is okay, the food is average and the prices aren't bad. Would recommend day drinking here, but it gets a bit outta hand on weekend nights."}
{"text":"Gotta love this Shadyside staple.   This versatile bar has served me for many a purpose, between school events, escape from overfilled Wednesday wine nights that happen down the street, a quick cheap bite or dinner, a staple miller lite under the outdoor tent, or even, to do homework while watching Sunday pro football.   Great people, quick service, hospitable people and a small, yet satisfying menu. Versatile and savory you will stay here long enough to get hungry again from lunch and repeat what my friend Matt did yesterday: Order the best thing he's ever eaten on the menu [the pulled chicken sliders] to his dire end of the night mistake [the Voodoo wings]. Delicious, but I quote: \"there isn't enough blue cheese to eat a dozen of these bad boys\" and people trying to help lighten the load, will suffer the consequences.  Make sure to say hi to the awesome bouncers on your way in, try not to get into a fight to spill a perfectly good full glass of Vodka Redbull and almost take out my chair and you should be good to go. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"First of all the website, as I was told, \"has been down for 4 years\" - even though it is very up. The specials and menu prices are apparently wrong.  My friends and I chose this place solely based on the fact they had advertised $3.50 20 oz Guinness. We needed a place to celebrate our graduation. With a party of 4 that grew to 6 we found the place pretty crowded and loud after awhile. Mostly we were pissed off that we were told on our 3rd round that the Guinness we were drinking was actually $5.50. ...really, it wasn't even a full 20 oz glass, it was one of those damn plastic cups. When we ordered at the beginning of the night it was quiet and the bartender said nothing about the price. At that point we decided to go somewhere else because it really wasn't our kind of bar in the first place, and you can absolutely find much cheaper Guinness in this city.   The guy didn't even apologize for the website - it's called false advertising, and it's a dick move, Mr. William Penn."}
{"text":"From the patrons to the bartenders to the staff and owners this place is must visit for anyone in pgh. I always have tremendously enjoyable conversation here and the prices are extremely fair. Booze selection is a bit limited but not when it comes to bourbon and beer which is all I really care about. Thanks for making pgh feel like home Rat and Boss!"}
{"text":"After going through the other reviews listed for this place I can see that a majority of people seem to focus on the 'Tavern' part.  But if you are like me and you are looking for a place to get lunch in Shadyside, you need to reconsider the name and take a venture in here.  While in Shadyside I attempted to stop at several other locations prior to coming here, each of those places were not open for the lunch hour, or if they were to open it was for a late lunch which I did not have time for.  After being deterred by the other establishments I stumbled upon William Penn Tavern.  I had been here before for a drink with friends years ago and scoffed at the idea of getting lunch here.  I should smack myself for thinking that because the lunch I ended up having was twice the amount of food compared to other establishments.  The menu isn't lengthy at all, in fact it is one of the smallest menus I have come across in a while.  Looking at it I just thought I would get a small amount of food that would hold me over until later in the day.  After glancing over the menu I had set in mind what I wanted.  When the bartender came back to me I gave my order and waited.  I ordered the Inadequacy Dog with cheese and some tots.    While waiting for my order to be prepared I finally took a look around the interior to take it all in.  Surprisingly there is a lot of natural light in here, chalk that up to the huge skylight located right over the bar.  Sports paraphernalia lines every inch of this place, I especially like the bobble-heads that are in abundance here.  Sports flags, jerseys, etc. are everywhere.  If that that catch your eye, let your ears do the exploring here.  Several televisions broadcasting various programs or just listen to the banter that takes place between the employees and frequent patrons.  With the delivery of my food I was brought back to reality and thought to myself that my eyes were bigger than my stomach.  The tots were plentiful.  Nice and crispy with each bite you take and unlike some places they do not stick to each other causing the loss of some amazing potato morsels.  Then when I finally noticed the Inadequacy Dog, what I can say about this is that the only thing that inadequate about this is how hungry you thought you were.  This is probably one of the most massive hot dogs I have ever seen.  The menu describes it as a foot-long hot dog, what the menu leaves out is the fact that this hot dog is about double the size around than most foot-longs you come across.  I had to cut this dog into smaller bites.  Not only that, but I took half of the hot dog and a good portion of the tots with me and had that as my dinner later in the day.    Top this all off with some fantastically fast service and it was a perfect lunch that I had.  **I did not partake in the beer selection, nor bar atmosphere later in the day**"}
{"text":"Not impressed. I travel all across the country and usually do wings at every city I visit. Appeared to be a great location and area to get some food. Arrived, nobody said hello, guess it was open seating so my cousin and I sat down. Waited for awhile, had to go up to order door to get someone to clean off table. Ordered cheese sticks, they're an appetizer, but they came with the rest of the food - that took forever. Not sure if they're were short handed or just busy. I will say that there was only two seats open when we arrived but when the table next to us kept asking for their check repeatedly, then I knew I wasn't the only one thinking they're slow. The one positive thing though was that our food was fresh and hot, so score two stars there! Not impressed with the kitchen sink wings, honey buffalo we're ok, also ordered BBQ and had them drop some buffalo sauce which actually was pretty darn good. Other than that, I do not plan or stopping by here again. Cool atmosphere for a bar scene."}
{"text":"Anytime I'm in Pittsburgh I make a point to come here for kitchen sink (the most amazing wing sauce).  Even after bad experiences here I will still always come back for that."}
{"text":"A lynchpin of William Penn's progressive legacy is liberty, which would at first glance seem to be consistent with the existence of a tavern. But he was still a Quaker, and he specifically promoted laws that forbade swearing and drunkenness. So I'm not sure how much he'd approve of this bar.  Me? I suppose I'm just underwhelmed. Not a lot of character, but cheap prices. Loud to begin with and louder still with music at an irritating decibel level. The patio is a small sticky slab of concrete. I made the mistake of coming on a Saturday evening, and the whole time I drank my beer (12 taps -- all crap) I couldn't wait to leave. A fine bar for young people who don't care what they are consuming and don't mind screaming at each other."}
{"text":"The food here is gross. We ordered nachos, which were mostly crushed round chips with some sprinkle cheese and a jalapeño or two on top. Then I got a shrimp po' boy. It was a long roll with a few Sam's club frozen popcorn shrimp and some lettuce, no sauce, dry as a bone. I ate a few of the shrimps and pitched the rest. Even as far as bar food goes, this place sucks. And it took almost 40 minutes for them to make it."}
{"text":"Best wings in Pittsburgh!!!!! The kitchen sink sauce is life changing. They're fries and chicken cheesesteaks are awesome too!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love William Penn Tavern. My favorite spot is the outdoor bar mainly because the inside is very crowded. The bar tenders are so friendly and the drinks are strong. This is a go-to spot for me in Shady Side!"}
{"text":"Friendly bartenders willing to put whatever sports event you want on the big screens. Frequent $0.50 wing nights. Wings delicious. Chicken fingers are a great value. And LARGE light beer pitchers for $7.50 all day every day.  College crowd after 10 on Friday/ Saturday. No better place to watch Steelers."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot to watch sports. It gets crowded during the football season so get there early to get a table. The 50 cent wings on Sunday, Tuesday, (i think Thursday) and Saturday are clutch."}
{"text":"Those stars are for the wings! If your not ordering wings don't come. I haven't tried everything on the menu buttttttt the nachos are skimpy and salty and those Mac and cheese bites are nothing but Kraft boxed Mac and cheese, no thank you. Oh and extra ranch is 75 cent and comes in a little cup smh... But wings are delicious and great price..."}
{"text":"Cheap dive bar, racist against Hispanics 0/10. Sadly under aged kids will still come here to get their cheap beer."}
{"text":"Do you like sports, beer, and fried pub grub and sandwiches? How about Shadyside?   Answering yes to these questions would probably mean you already know about the Tav, but should you not, this might be your place.   Admittedly, it's not one of my regular spots, but I'll submit that when an occasion calls for multiple screens of sports, copious amounts of food and booze, and a energetic atmosphere, the Tavern hits the spot."}
{"text":"If you want an advise, I can tell you: Never go there! Worst place ever! The people who works there are extremely rude and the place is a piece of shit! I could give zero star if I could!"}
{"text":"It's a sports bar... I've heard the wings were good, but the bad hip-hop was too loud to be worth staying for more than one glass"}
{"text":"Pros: convenient location in Shadyside, sufficient lighting for the mood  Cons: Crowded, full of frat-boy types, bartenders would kick everyone out at closing time  Perhaps, I didn't have a great experience because I got dragged here against my will.  But it was unbearably crowded and loud.  The kind where it's most likely that you'll spill someone's else's drink.  It was more than once that I heard glass breaking.  It's a kind of place you would go to meet random people than a place you would go to just hang out with friends.   My friends enjoyed their drinks, so I grant the bar that.  At closing time however, the bartender yelled that we had to get out since it was closing.  They turned on the bright lights, cut the music and stopped the heat to force us out.  So I might not be the target audience.  This is my friend's favorite bar.  I am not sure why.  The frat-boy like atmosphere may be it, but I have always preferred the low-key type bars."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars in Shadyside!  The bartenders are awesome, with a great sense of humor, and they even help me with recommendations for new drinks to try out when I'm bored of my same old go to.    Once you get to know the staff they actually acknowledge the fact that they know you which makes you feel like going out was worth it.   Last night, (busy Saturday night) my bartender got so busy he had to jump to the outdoor bar to help out and forgot to bring me my wings, but he quickly apologized, gave them to me for free and even overly compensated with a free drink as well. Great service and they really do care about their customers.   Weeknights are a little slow (what else do you expect?) but weekends are packed starting around midnight, it can be fun, but it can also get annoying with the constant bumping and pushing to navigate through the crowds. But if you have a table either inside or outside with friends you forget how busy it is.  If you're in the area I highly recommend you to stop in for a few drinks and try some snacks. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've only ordered take out here a few times and it's pretty standard pub fare but super fast and they deserve a damn award for that Voodoo sauce. Order it with hella blue cheese or ranch or fries because it is intense (not the hottest sauce in the world, but like so much cot dang flavor)."}
{"text":"So they don't serve alcohol that black folks enjoy in order to keep them out?  Is this true William Penn Tavern?"}
{"text":"I usually hate this place, but yesterday they did let me bring in a bowl of pho and eat it while all my other friends ordered wings and beer, with minimal lip from the wait staff. So I guess there's that."}
{"text":"Tuesday nights and I believe Saturday are 25 cent wings and dollar drafts. My friends and I hit this place up nearly every Tuesday when we were still in college. The crowd is mostly college kids due to its proximity to Carnegie Mellon.  The kitchen sink wings are the best wings I have ever eaten in my life. They are made a little different each time. Sometimes they are nice and spicy, sometimes not so spicy. If you manage to get them spicy. savor the flavor. They are also really good when they aren't that hot but even better when they are nice and spicy. The waitresses are really nice and once you go there enough times, they just start bringing over trays of beer when it looks like you are getting low.  The chili cheese fries are also slathered with chili and cheese and are great if you just want to let loose and not worry about going to the bathroom multiple times the next morning.   Actually, if pair the kitchen sink wings with the chili cheese fries, do plan on spending a little more time in the bathroom the next morning. I know I have. Multiple times. When the weather is nice, they open up the back porch so try and grab a table because pounding beers, eating wings and watching footbal couldn't be any better. I always stop by here whenever I travel back to Pittsburgh and I love it."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with the mom. Wow wait was 20 minutes for food at lunch time, worth every darn moment. We got the pulled pork and slaw plus the buffalo chicken wrap and fries. The food was astounding. The cook placed a little bit of his soul in that food. I have been so used to lack of caring of what comes out of most kitchens this gentleman was proud. He delivered it hot to our table and our server was that you would expect from any bar (feel free to get up and go track them down for whatever you need, saves on yours and there head aching). Over all it was 10 dollars a meal, not bad in downtown terms. I also saw the salads a table of men had each was fresh green leaves with a mound of meat on top it. Cannot wait to try one next time around."}
{"text":"It's the go-to for Carnegie Mellon students. $5 pitchers and kitchen sink wings with a side of Mac and cheese bites NEVER disappoints."}
{"text":"I am only giving one star because Yelp won't let me give zero stars. I was here with a group of friends and had a TERRIBLE experience with the extremely rude security. All of us are transplants to Pittsburgh and come from different states. As many people know (and bouncers especially NEED to to know), not all states have the same standards for the material that state IDs are printed on. Our friend from South Carolina had one such example of an ID that is printed on pretty flimsy material. When the bouncer checked his ID, he said he couldn't accept it, to which we responded assuring it was real and offered other forms of ID to prove this. Rather than hand back the ID and send us away, the guy immediately RIPPED HIS ID IN HALF. Can you say destruction of property? Note that all of us are over the age of 25 and clearly not frehmen in college just trying to sneak in. Needless to say, I will never come back here."}
{"text":"Typical sports bar with great wings! Kitchen Sink Wings were $.50 each the night we went. The fried zucchini was great as well (more breading then zucchini, but it doesn't matter after a few beers). We also tried the nachos and tater tots, which were fine. Service was great! They also have daily beer specials."}
{"text":"My son who is non confrontational and mild mannered was assaulted at this bar for nothing and jumped by 8 other patrons and staff.  His neck was broken this was his first time at this bar.  He was out celebrating with 2 other friends 1 male, who was assaulted also and a female who they waited for to goto the bathroom.  Wouldn't have given any stars!"}
{"text":"I come here every week for their wings. This weekend my dad came to visit and we came here twice because he said they were the best wings he's ever had. The kitchen sink sauce is THE best. I am disappointed that they stopped doing a wing special though"}
{"text":"Kitchen sink wings. Plain wings. Fries with cheese. Chicken cheesesteak and steak salad. These are a few of my favorite things. So good. Generous portions. Love the hot pepper relish on sandwiches. Soups are usually pretty good too. Divey but a great bar. Friendly bartenders and patrons. Lots of tvs."}
{"text":"Wednesday night is wing night.  So I had to go with the Yuengling and wings.  Not terribly crowded or loud as others indicated.    Attentive service sitting in bar area.  Slightly limited menu, mostly sandwiches and a few salads, wings are the primary fare."}
{"text":"Weirdest nights ever. Wormhole tequila black-out. Too crowded/hot/cold."}
{"text":"Beer and wing specials almost daily and THE BEST wings I've ever put in my mouth--get the the kitchen sink wings and spicy ranch wings. If you try and hate either of them then you probably don't deserve to live a happy fulfilled life.   Legitimately salivate every time I think about these wings. Now I've developed a craving. Thanks, yelp, for making me write this review and causing intense hunger pains.  Oh and it's also the go-to bar for CMU students so if you're into that...."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the wings here because they give you a healthy helping of sauce for the wings and the flavors are really tasty. I typically get medium, hot or the \"kitchen sink\" flavor. In my opinion, those are the best flavors!   I would typically go to William Penn on on the 50 cent wing days - the only down side is, you can't take it to go! I would stop by William Penn as a pre-dinner snack (6-8 wings) before I ate my actual dinner.   It was also a great place to stop for dinner before going to the different bars and shenanigans happening on Walnut Street."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good place to catch a game and have some pub food and drinks with a Pittsburgh flavor, this is your place."}
{"text":"Came to this place on a suggestion from a random stranger in downtown Pittsburgh. If we lived near here this would be my weekly hangout. Sammy and our waitress treated us like we were family. The wings and sauces were the best we've had ever!!!!!! Best place ever. William Penn would be proud. This place has honored his name. Fantastic place. A must try for anyone in the Pittsburgh Area."}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar in Pittsburgh. From the cheap wings and beer to the friendly (at time) service, this is the place I kept coming back to over my two years in the city. It's always a relaxed atmosphere, can be hard to find a seat, and I just love the place. I'll miss it now that I've left the city but looking forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Came to William Penn Tavern after an incredibly long day of work and met friends to watch the women's World Cup on the back patio. It was raining pretty hard and the satellite feeds to the game and ninja warrior on the TV next to it were in and out at times.  The bartender was very nice, and although she didn't ask us about ordering food, we eventually discovered that it was $1.25 taco night because she was eating some at the bar while watching TV with us. The tacos were good for the price. Small flower tortillas, ground beef, lettuce, and tomato. Salsa and sour cream in the side.   The atmosphere was very relaxed and welcoming, and although on a busier night I'm sure John Taffer might have gone ballistic, there was not much to fuss about as it was basically just my small group of friends and a few others watching soccer on a rainy night.   While I would certainly like to explore more of the menu and drinks offered in the main bar, I'd certainly give William Penn Tavern an A-OK thumbs up."}
{"text":"My fav local hangout!!!! Staff is awesome! Food is phenominal!!!! Great place to watch a game. Ive met a few cool people here as well. Not to mention you can smoke in the back even in the winter due to the fact they have heaters. Very cool looking ones at that. I normally drop about 200 bucks each time I go. Not including and average 40 dollar tip. Maybe that's why the staff loves me and I get great service. Haha"}
{"text":"Great spot  for a casual night out with good friends (you know the kind) -- cheap drinks and food with a laid back atmosphere.  Can't go wrong!  Highly recommend their wings - completely addictive.  Special house sauce all the way! No doubt about it.  Relax and enjoy."}
{"text":"Love this place- my favorite bar in Shadyside. The staff are awesome and the foods great, too! Just your standard bar menu, but all of it hits the spot. Wings and sandwiches are my favorite. And who doesn't love tator-tots?! (One of their most popular sides)   Aside from the food, this is a great sports bar. Too many TV's to count, so you always have a great view."}
{"text":"My favorite college bar with delicious bar food.  The kitchen sink wings are a must - if you don't like wings you can get the kitchen sink chicken tender wrap which is amazing.  I love their mac n' cheese bites.  My go to drink was a john daly's which they make wonderfully.  The bartender's are nice - but be prepared for crazyness on the weekends! This is probably one of the most popular bars in Shadyside and gets nuts after 11pm."}
{"text":"Extremely dirty bathrooms, looked & smelled like they hadn't been cleaned in days. Absolutely unacceptable and disgusting!"}
{"text":"Review base on wings n beer! Been here a couple of times now. I always seem to come when they have wings on special. Which works out great for me because I love wings, and their wings are so tasty! I particularly like the kitchen sink wings, but they have multiple yummy flavors. They are a great price and always have some kind of beer deal. Perfect lunch spot on Sunday. Service is ok, but they are always pretty busy place."}
{"text":"Felt like I was in a time warp.  Everyone new each others name.  Stopped by for a quick beer, sandwich and some wings.  Many customers know each other and were very friendly.  So was the staff.  Ran into someone I work with.  Holy Cow!  Wings were pretty good. Had a sausage hoagie and it was good.  Beer is pretty cheap.   Daily specials on food and beer."}
{"text":"BEST mac and cheese bites ever! These mac and cheese bites are not the traditional ball shape; they are little triangles of heaven served with ranch; they are crispy on the outside and cheesey on the inside. $6.95 is enough for two hungry people or a small snack among 4. Wings (10 for $9.50) are also delicious, would recommend the Honey BBQ. The Kitchen Sink sauce is a little weird, but can imagine some people really liking it. The tots ($3.95) are also great munchies. There are lots of nights with discounts such as half off wings, so def check those out.  Gets crowded with some college students and some older folks as well - might be difficult to get a table. However, service was great and our server checked up on us several times despite the crowds."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot on nights when the wings are only 50 cents. You really can't beat Will Penn when it comes to wings and a great sports environment. It's a bit grungy since it's also a bar that's frequented by tons of college kids, but it's a place where you can still feel comfortable and have a good time with a group of friends. Would definitely recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"The waitress told us we had to leave our table right after we paid our bill (and tipped her generously) just because we hadn't ordered another drink. I have never been treated so rudely by a waitstaff before in my life."}
{"text":"I love the staff because they are very friendly and nice but they no longer carry the wing specials. They only have 50 cents boneless wings and they are small. The charge of a dollar per wing ding is too much. I used to go all the time but now I barely go there and YES I always spent money and tipped the staff"}
{"text":"Fries: 5 stars  Cheesesteak 5 stars no non alcoholic beer 0 stars Location 4 stars Interior:  2 stars Bonus points for service and longevity"}
{"text":"Last night I was out for drinks with some my friends. It was my first time there. Our server's name was Amy and she was amazing! Very attentive. Will definitely be back based on the service we received!"}
{"text":"Wings are perfect. Medium sized and crispy. Sauces are pretty good: Ranch: typical restaurant ranch, Medium: thicker n somewhat vinegary, Voodoo: thick bbq with Italian seasoning. Cajun rub is a little much but very tasty."}
{"text":"Wonderful neighborhood dive/sports bar with good and intelligent bartenders and good food."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre but the wing specials and flavors are decent.  The beer specials are pretty good.  It has a dive bar feel despite being in the heart of Shadyside, which is a nice change of pace if that's what you are looking for.  The TV situation for sports isn't the best, but there are quite a few TV's and you should be able to catch the game from wherever you are seated.  The outdoor patio/bar is a nice touch in Summer."}
