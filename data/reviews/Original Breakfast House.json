{"text":"The wife and I were in the area and decided on breakfast out for Saturday Morning. We saw the high rating and boy, do they deserve it! There were at least six parties in front of us but we were seated in under 10 minutes. The atmosphere of the place is busy, bustling, and loud. I ordered the Cajun Andouille Sausage and Chedder Scramble and the wife ordered the Chicken Apple Sausage Scramble. Our order was on the table in under 5 minutes. We both opted for the home fries upon the recomendation of our server and they were very good. Perfectly seasoned with a firm crust on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside. We also both opted for a biscuit and paid extra for the gravy. Soooo worth it. Thier gravy was made from real sausage, slighty sweet with a hint of warm spices, fantastic. The scrambles were mostly large chunks of delicious and succulent sausage, with just the right amount of cage-free eggs and cheese. The coffee was good, standard higher end restaurant fare and the service was amazing. The servers and staff were fast, polite, and accomadating. We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great location, excellent service and Incredible FOOD!!  They have eggs and spam! And its really good.  :)

I've been back a dozen times already."}
{"text":"Luv this place!  Everytime we enter this breakfast eatery we are served with consistent great service & great food.  Linguisa sausage is a favorite of mine and is often served as a breakfast special."}
{"text":"I have been frequenting OBH since they opened.  A GASTRO DELIGHT AND GREAT STAFF! Fresh local organic fruit veggies.  I have tried many many items on the menu and have found a a few to be only great while most are exceptional.  Portions are on the \"you may hurt yourself trying to finish it all.\"   I always have leftovers to take home. Well unless I am hungover then the chicken fried steak and french toast special has no chance.

The owner is always checking to make sure everything is great. I have dined with people that have food allergies and when ordering they forgot to have some of the ingredients listed on the menu removed. When the food came out she was not able to eat it. She figured she ordered it wrong so she would take it home for someone else to eat. The waitress asked why she was not eating and insisted that they remake the food so she could enjoy a meal with the rest of us. 

For quality and quantity of food the prices are very fair.

Don't let the lines detour you they move fast. 

P.S. I had planned to take a picture of my meal but when the food arrived it looked so good I dug in and was half way done by the time I remembered I wanted to take a picture."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been here twice and both times were excellent. I love the regular American diner feel, with no frills and letting the food speak for itself. We both had omelettes the first time (the El Paso for me and spinach mushroom for her). The chorizo in the El Paso wasn't too greasy and the guac (makes everything better) and sour cream balanced the spicy chorizo. This time we both had French toast (she had the banana pecan and I had the regular). What can I say about the French toast except WOW! The batter has orange zest, cinnamon, and vanilla then they deep fry it too add just a little decadence. Don't forget to have the fresh squeezed O.J. with free refills. I have found my favorite French toast spot and possibly my favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"What a great breakfast place. Not only is the food delicious but the attentive service we received was awesome. Thank you very much!"}
{"text":"I drove forever and a day to get here with the promise that it was an excellent place for brunch. It was! The food and service were fantastic and the experience was well worth the drive. The surprisingly young group of management running the restaurant are so hospitable and caring; it's definitely a diamond in the rough.

My friend ordered a hearty looking breakfast sandwich special with fried potatoes and pico de gallo. She inhaled it happily. I chose the breakfast special: Short stack - (2) fluffy, lightly lemon-tasting pancakes, 2 pork sausages and 2 poached eggs. Everything was excellent, especially the pancakes and sausages. The staff was very attentive down to the detail on exactly how I liked my eggs prepared. 

By the time I realized I should take a photo for Yelp, I looked down at a completely empty plate. Oops :)

The location is very close to the 51 freeway on the SE corner of 32nd Street and Thunderbird in an unassuming strip mall.

The venue is powerchair/wheelchair accessible, including spacious restrooms.

Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast we have ever had in a restaurant! We had the carnitas and the el paso omelettes, they were delicious. Our waitress Divina was very attentive and pleasant! This was our first time here, all the way from Maryland and Delaware and we will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"It's great to find another breakfast/brunch place with a friendly staff and tasty food. I tried the biscuits & gravy, a daily special, and I was extremely pleased with the gravy. Every bite seemed to taste better, and the dish came with three biscuits instead of the standard two.
I also ordered two eggs over-easy and they were cooked exactly right, which doesn't happen often even in restaurants that focus on breakfast items. The orange juice is fresh-squeezed and while expensive at $4, you can get as many refills as you want for free. The regular menu is pretty typical for a local breakfast joint, with a slight emphasis on Tex-Mex themed choices. 

The service was super fast (I ate at about 10:30 a.m. on a Friday) but I did not feel rushed. The waitress left a coffee carafe without asking, which is really a nice touch.

I definitely plan to make the Original Breakfast House a regular habit from now on."}
{"text":"If you are traveling this is a great bet because the locals eat here.  Nice diner atmosphere with lost of light, good food and great service.  Pancakes are amazing."}
{"text":"Absolutely in love with this place and their San Francisco French toast. Like I love french toast but the one's here, OH MY GOD! I can't begin to describe what it taste like but if you are against sweet flavors then you need to skip over this glorious option and choose something else off the menu. This is no ordinary french toast. It's fried, weird looking but delicious , did I mention massive? 1 slice would do just fine and that says a lot coming from me because I love to eat. Apple Juice is fresh with the little brown stuff settling at the bottom of your cup. Hashbrowns are great. Omelette is great! Service was phenomenal (they even walk around sometimes serving free baked goods). I've tried this place a few times and it has never failed me once, best breakfast place I've ran into in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff! From the moment that I walked in I was greeted by the manager and guided to my table promptly. Sarah, our server, was very cheerful and knowledgeable about the menu. She had great recommendations for us and was very good about checking on us and bringing coffee to our table. 

We look forward to coming back soon!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is the real deal.  Food is well prepared and well priced.  Service is attentive and considerate.  The BiG Breakfast Sandwich is simple, ample and served quickly. Great place for breakfast meetings conveniently located near Highway 51. Family friendly."}
{"text":"Good food great service what else could you ask for. We went on a Saturday morning and it was busy. They great you at the door. My son has a hard time walking and they put us in a booth right by the door. Smiles everywhere from the staff.  Very friendly I'm sure I'll be back when I come to town again."}
{"text":"Was really good food, they just do breakfast a little different. I.E. their french toast is like fried so it tastes more like funnel cake, and their pancakes have lemon zest in the batter, but it is still delicious."}
{"text":"Triple berry french toast makes my morning every time!  I love scheduling breakfast meetings here. Great staff and great food!"}
{"text":"The hubs and I came here for lunch today.  I had the french toast special that comes with 2 slices of their signature french toast, 2 eggs, and 2 slices of bacon or sausage.  I, of course, went with the meat candy known as bacon.  I also ordered a glass of orange juice.  The hubs had the ham stacked jack sandwich with french fries and an iced tea.  

The orange juice is fresh squeezed.  Literally, they juice the oranges just before pouring into your glass!  It was very delicious.  The crust on the french toast was a bit chewy but aside from that it was absolutely divine.  The eggs and bacon deliciously complimented the main dish.  The ham stacked jack sandwich and fries was delicious as well.  

This was the second time I've been here and I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"This place has great service and even better food. I eat here once a week and recommend everyone to try it. Chicken fried chicken with the French toast is my favorite but only order if your hungry it's a lot of food."}
{"text":"Cost me $20 for one person this morning. Just for French toast and a very small plate of COLD home fries for $3 ...ehhhhh disappointed. The prices unfortunately did not match the quality for me today. But the people working there are so nice I would reconsider going back honestly, maybe if I had the money breakfast is suppose to be a nostalgic experience it brings us back to our childhood but I remember cafes being cheap and the quantity being much bigger, it shouldn't cost 10$ for 2 slices of French toast......not cool."}
{"text":"Phenomenal.  Been in Phoenix for the week and on the last day found this place.  Great food and service."}
{"text":"RESTAURANT CLOSED 7/12/16 to 7/21/16 

After reading positive reviews for the Original Breakfast House I was excited to finally try it. Unfortunately we had to change plans as soon as we arrived due to the restaurant being closed from 7/12-7/21 for vacation. Being closed for this length of time you would think the owner would have made the effort to update their voicemail and website. 

Very disappointing after making the drive. As we sat in the car looking for other breakfast options we watched over 20 parties walk away just as disappointed, and that was only within 15 minutes. 

Note to owner: next time you want to close for almost 10 days to go on vacation, please at least be courteous enough to your existing and new customers to update your voicemail and website accordingly."}
{"text":"Delicious!  This place was recommended by a colleague and it was great!  We ordered the five egg white omelette and the banana pecan French toast.  Both were perfect, but the French toast was like nothing I've ever had!  I can't even describe how incredible it was!  Get there early!  We dined at 7:30am on a Saturday and got a seat immediately, but as we were cashing out it was getting quite crowded."}
{"text":"The best! The deep fried french toast is superb and the staff is very friendly and always smiling. The fresh squeezed orange juice is so yummy! You really can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I took my son here on a breakfast date. We both enjoyed our food! It came out fast and portions are huge! 
Love the fresh squeezed orange juice. Amazing service! Food was DELISH. Love the homey feel this place has! I'd rather come here than any other breakfast place.  Support small business when at all possible!"}
{"text":"Must try. We were in from out of town and this place was highly recommended. We had the french toast and pancakes. Both were excellent with a unique twist. Service was friendly and quick. Pricing is fair for the portion size and food quality. We will be back."}
{"text":"First time visit, it did not disappoint.  I know we'll be back.  I think we lucked out with just a 10 minute wait.  This placed looked like it was everyone's go-to for a weekend family breakfast.  Food came out quick, warm and flavorful.  That's too bad (for us) that it closes at 2 but then again, even they want to relax.  I don't blame em.  Everyone was friendly and I was impressed the manager/owner stopped by to see how our meal was, a smooth move for any restaurant."}
{"text":"A delicious concoction of scrambled eggs, sausage, onion mushroom, and home fries, that looks like something I'd make, but tastes so much better! 

Great decaf, coffee and they even had soy milk! 

Very accommodating, and friendly staff too."}
{"text":"We loved the Original Breakfast House!  The food was so delicious and reasonable priced!  Each of my family members ordered something different ElPaso omelette, Hog Heaven Omelette, Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs, and Fried Eggs with Hashbrowns.  It was delicious!  The staff was helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"We wanted Cracker Barrell but they are all so far away, found the Original Breakfast House instead, we are so happy we did, it's so much better than Cracker Barrell, we will definitely be back, it's our new favorite, the biscuits & pancakes are the best ever NomNom"}
{"text":"so so good! so much food that we all loved. I wish I had room to try a MASSIVE cinnamon roll."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the city!

Close to home they need to expand as weekends are very crowded!

Definitely worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"For me a movie has to be amazing to watch it twice in a row. It's the same with breakfast...this is the second morning in a row I ate breakfast at this place. First day was traditional eggs, bacon, hashbrowns and toast. Second day the el paso. Both the food and service was awesome. What was particularly interesting was that I sat at a booth and eavesdropped on a conversation between two men talking business. It turns out it was the owner! I have owned a business for over 15 years and I can attest the owner is very wise, compassionate, and truly believes in quality service. I am not only sold on the food and service, but on the vision of someone who has passion for what he does."}
{"text":"We found the original breakfast house almost 9 months ago. It's now part of our regimen every Saturday for breakfast. The food is fresh not processed. And absolutely wonderful. The staff is like family . We especially like Desiree and Gina.  They are so personable and likable. One of our favorite places to eat. Come try at least one time you won't be disappointed. But beware you might have to wait cuz there are a lot of others that share my opinion.... lol"}
{"text":"Tasty well-priced food! Great service too! Recommend getting there early though because it's always busy... Great sign! We got the French toast special which was amazing! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, very clean and fantastic cinnamon rolls.  Have never left hungry.  Keep up the great work.  YUM."}
{"text":"Fresh, local, healthy, huge portions, and delicious.  My husband and I love the atmosphere and we eat here... a lot.  Great prices, service, everything.  Come on a day when you're not in a hurry and you just want to enjoy your meal.  We've had everything and never leave feeling gross or disappointed."}
{"text":"Juan's Tacos are the best - Service was outstanding !!! better get in there quick it fills up fast :)"}
{"text":"We love this place.  Food is great, the fries are to die for, and everyone working here is always so nice"}
{"text":"Chicken fried chicken with French toast and eggs was great.  Th French toast was amazing. Also had the fresh squeezed orange juice. It was very good. Staff very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Excellent food, quick service and fresh squeezed orange juice. The pancakes have a slight lemon taste to them; I haven't had that before and was pleasantly surprised. I don't really buy into all the organic hype but the eggs were better than most I've had before."}
{"text":"Great waitress,quality food,everything about this place is perfect.Best meal I had in a while.I drove 40 min to have a quality meal and It was worth it that to the oringinal breakfast house"}
{"text":"Such an amazing breakfast place! The French toast is amazing and unlike anywhere else in the valley. Coffee's hot, and the service is spectacular! 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"Great place! Busy on a Sunday morning...but the line moved right along and wait wasn't too long. French toast is deep fried and it was delicious! Order coffee, they bring a carafe, same with water--I really appreciated this. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Discovered OBH when visiting from Cali. It's obvious the owner takes personal pride and attention adding his personal touches to decor and culinary expertise.
So happy about the Gluten Free pancakes with blueberries and bananas with real Vermont Maple syrup. It got us started right for a Saturday morning hike.
The staff is amazingly friendly and smiles!

Love this place!"}
{"text":"The lemon curd pancakes are way too sweet.. and the portions are extremely large (not complaining)"}
{"text":"This place is great. You must have the San Francisco style french Toast. Get it with the strawberrie preserve. Best breakfast place in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"WOW!  Our second trip here was fantastic!  This time we went for lunch with a large group of friends (12) and everyone in our party had a great experience.  The food was awesome, some people ordered lunch, while others got breakfast and everybody complimented the food.  And the service was over the top.  Maybe we received a little special attention because our sweetheart server used to attend the grade school where we all taught.  (We're all retired teachers/spouses.)

In a sea of franchises and corporate chains this little place is a neighborhood gem.  We will definitely be back whenever we can.  We're going to pry our family away from VI and bring them here for our next family breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great food and really enjoy the great service ! Chicken fried steak damn near gave me a heart attack but it would have been worth it !"}
{"text":"I work in a popular breakfast joint and when people tell me the wait is too long, I point them in the direction of the OG breakfast house. It is small, local, and they seem to have sustainability in mind. The service is great, friendly but never too much. Their biscuits are made in house and they have fresh squeezed OJ. The wait is never too long, especially if you come before 9am. If you love breakfast and supporting your local businesses, than this is a great place for you."}
{"text":"The ham & cheese omelet was great, as were the country potatoes, but the high point for me was the fresh-squeezed orange juice. Delicious! Nice atmosphere and friendly service contributed to my very enjoyable breakfast."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast place! It doesn't look like much driving by, but it's worth the spot. They have fresh squeezed OJ that's amazing. They also use locally grown and some organic items. The pancakes are delicious, with a pleasant, light taste of lemon in the batter. My omelet was $10.95 BUT came with 2 sides (I chose home fries and pancakes), so there is plenty of yummy food for the price. It's a must try!"}
{"text":"The best pancakes and breakfast place love the staff best customer service 
My kids and I drive 40 mins to come here and is always worth it"}
{"text":"Unbelievable! Closer to $$ but well worth it! 97% of menu is home made and organic. Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"We wanted breakfast & I just really wanted to try somewhere different. Checked Yelp and liked the reviews. Bit of a drive from 51st Ave & the 101.
Sitting outside waiting to get called, yes waiting, but no worries, well worth the wait!
We asked fellow waiters about this place and all gave high praises & shared what their favs are. 
I ordered the banana pecan pancakes & hash browns. He ordered biscuits and gravy. Two glasses of the fresh squeezed OJ, took my second to go and coffee. And a brioche cinnamon roll to go as well. :-)
Well...everything was so yummy! 
The OJ is like sticking your straw right into an orange.
Pancakes & hash browns rocked!
That cinnamon roll had sooo many layers, now I get the brioche part.
Owner, John, on the floor saying Hi & being the dude.
Divina our waitress was so sweet, great smile :-)
Great breakfast joint! We Will Return
Fran G & Phillip B"}
{"text":"Amazing food. The wait wasn't long at all and it was so yummy! The French toast is amazing as it sounds! The hype is totally true!"}
{"text":"Happened to be in the neighborhood this morning so stopped by for breakfast.  Ten-minute wait for two at 9 am on a Saturday isn't bad.  Had the Farmer's Market omelet with a fruit side and an upgrade to a scone.  Scone was very good -- not too big and very fresh.  Omelet was average and a little bland.  The food and service are on par with The Good Egg, i.e., fairly ordinary.  Not worth a special drive from Central PHX -- stick to Matt's, Scramble, Snooze, or Daily Diner."}
{"text":"Don't let the wait scare you away. The food and staff  are well worth the wait. The chicken fried chicken is amazing. From the coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice to the cinnamon roll and everything in between we were not disappointed. Everything we ordered was great.
The service was good too EVERY person there was very friendly . I travel a lot and have never had a better experience. This place is a must! !"}
{"text":"I found this place through yelp reviews and it did not disappoint. Overall, the service was decent and the food was great.  We'll definitely be back again for the food. Our waitress wasn't too attentive to us once the food came out since we ran out of coffee half way through the meal.  She may have been new since she had to come back and ask my friend how she wanted her eggs on a breakfast sandwich and when asked which menu item was better she was unsure what to recommend and she seem a little unorganized with the checking out process (ie took my friend's check who paid cash and didn't bring back the change until asked, etc)."}
{"text":"Good pancakes, blue berries tasted fresh, and so did the orange juice. My husband had the banana French toast, wasn't a fan of the deep fried though. We will probably come again. Seat was wet when I sat down, not happy. They wiped it with a soaking rag and didn't dry it. Service was good. 10 min wait for a Saturday morning. Not the greatest part of town."}
{"text":"The staff are nice enough.  Place gets super busy. The food is not particularly good and relatively limited for anyone who doesn't eat Lori / vegetarian.  One of the more overrated places around right now."}
{"text":"Had a fabulous breakfast here with some girlfriends.  I had the special which was pumpkin pecan pancakes.  Absolutely mouth watering!  One of the girls had French toast another had the chicken fried steak.  We were all extremely happy with the meal and the service! Best coffee also!  If you are in Phoenix, don't miss this breakfast restaurant.  Reasonably priced and great food!"}
{"text":"Our family loves to go out every Sunday for breakfast and we were excited to try this new breakfast joint.  However the dishes we ordered were terrible.  I ordered bacon and cheddar omelet.  It had a big cheese golf ball size glob in the middle and the omelet was quite brown/ well done on the outside.  Another reviewer raved about the hash browns. Mine was the size of the omelet but old and soggy greasy.  However the pancake was edible and I liked the lemon hint.  ( My husband and son tried it and did not like it.)  Both my husband and son ordered the country fried steak. It was not crispy and the thick, clumpy gravy had too much grease.  I had encouraged them to get the hashbrowns and they felt the same way.  The waitress took our order, brought our drinks and then the check.  She never checked back to see how we liked the food.  I did tell the hostess when we were leaving when she asked.  She had no comment.  The ToGo box was top quality and held our mound of food quite well for our dogs.  Not a good idea because they got sick too.  What a bad experience for $39!   
Loved that the owner supports using locally grown food!"}
{"text":"OBH has been our favorite breakfast restaurant since we discovered it a couple years ago. Never a bad meal, always great service and it's nice to see the owner working. My favorite meal is Juan's Tacos. The variety of pancakes is also noteworthy."}
{"text":"Great place, unique. Good food. Just have to try it out. Interesting history. Seems to always be packed for breakfast."}
{"text":"If anyone asks where to go for breakfast I always say OBH! everything on the menu is awesome! Especially the street tacos :D those are my favorite!"}
{"text":"I am so glad I found this wonderful breakfast place while I was in Arizona. The food is great. I had French toast with bananas on top. I was most impressed by my waitress and the rest of the staff. They were beyond kind and very helpful and kind to eachother. This makes a big difference in the service industry today. Thanks guys and Roll Tide!"}
{"text":"This place was super busy and had a pretty long wait on a Sunday...but it was worth it.  The portion sizes are big and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Went Monday morning at 6:30am for Breakfast after looking for someplace other than IHOP on Yelp; was absolutely thrilled with everything we got.

OBH has the comfortable feel of a \"classic american diner\" (very clean and bright, not dingy and old) but when you start eating the food, you realize the owner and chef are going above and beyond the \"typical american diner\" food.

Just for starters; the orange juice is fresh squeezed... as in, \"Oh look over there, you can see them squeezing the juice I am about to drink from a crate of oranges\". For citrus snobs (like myself) you're next question is probably: \"Yea but how ripe were the oranges?\" because you know just because you juice an orange by hand doesn't guarantee good juice. Don't worry, the juice was fantastic. Rich, a little tiny bit pulpy and with a deep orange flavor not  washed out/unripened or sour taste. 

Did I mention you get 1 free refill on the juice to boot? Didn't expect that at all... we go to Old Town a lot for breakfast where a thin glass of juice will set you back $5; not only is OBH fresh-squeezing this stuff but also giving you an awesome amount of it.

(If you've never squeezed your own oranges you might not appreciate how much work it is to get a large volume of juice out of oranges; it can take a bag full just to get a small pitcher's worth).

Next was the coffee.

Kelly (our peach of a waitress) brought the pot over to leave on our table and said \"Oh our coffee is really good\" -- I didn't think much of it as I've roasted my own beans, been through a few cappuccino machines (Jura and Rancilio) and am generally a coffee snob. 

Given that, I was totally surprised when sure enough, the coffee WAS excellent... it is a very smooth blend, almost no acidity or bite and just had a very easy rich flavor. I threw some cream and sugar in it and it was absolutely wonderful.

So now we get to the food, my wife and I ordered:

* (Me) 5 egg-white scramble w/ home fries and white toast
* (Wife) French toast special w/ sausage

The serving sizes are generous; I would put it on par with something like Cracker Barrel where your meal shows up and you go \"Oh crap, that is a lot of food\"; you absolutely feel like you are being taken care of.

The food was FANTASTIC.

The owner and the chef are doing what I would describe as \"Classic American Breakfast++\" -- meaning all the classics and originals you would recognize, but done with extra TLC that makes the restaurant that much more memorable and delicious.

For example, the bread you get with your meal isn't crap bread from the super market; it is artisan bread from a local bakery that they chop into thick, soft, toasted slices that melt butter perfectly.

The jam that comes with your toast isn't Smuckers in little packets; it is a custom jam from a small company out of Tucson, AZ (like a fruit compote)

The french toast is DEEP FRIED... do you realize how tasty this is? It's like a funnel cake, cinnamon role and big piece of artisan bread all had a baby and then it was deep fried with an egg wash and covered in butter and syrup... it's amazing.

These little touches of excellence that are all over the menu and make all the difference.

For a brand new place that just opened up (~3 months ago) OBH seems to be doing everything right and I doubt it will be much longer until this is that breakfast place you swing by on a Sat or Sun morning and there is a 30min wait. We already saw a handful of regulars that were known by name come strolling in.

We'll likely go back soon to give lunch a try, but as far as breakfast is concerned we were thrilled."}
{"text":"Food is good but overpriced. Oj is great. For the life of me I can't understand why family restaurants don't put changing tables in the bathroom. Sure, I'll walk out to the car and change my baby.
It's only 105 out. Then make a trip back to the bathroom to wash my hands and wait for 5 mins for someone else to come out. We won't be back until the babe is potty trained. I refuse to go to restaurants that can't make that small investment for their customers

Edit: I appreciate the owners timely response to my concerns. I did not know the counter in the bathroom was for changing babies, and I am not one to just throw my baby on a counter and change her in a public place. Thank you for clarifying and maybe if you could verbalize that that is the purpose of it to your staff. When I asked the hostess if there was a changing station she said if there was it would be in the bathroom. Thanks for your response!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place for breakfast.  They have the most sinful cinnamon rolls... Staff is always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Good Heavens this place is wonderful! The ambiance, decor, coffee, and food were all better than good. I had the new Pork Omelet with Green Chile sauce and it was so good I had to observe a moment of silence after each bite. Put The Pepper Plant sauce (on the table) on top of it - trust me on this. Hubs had the Mexican Benedict and it was fantastic. If we lived here this would be on the local favorites list for sure."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. The prices are unbeatable and the portions are very generous. As we walked through the door we were welcomed with smiling and friendly faces. The service is impeccable and the ambiance is great too. It feels as if you are at an old fashioned diner yet at the same time it has a contemporary and fresh feel to it. They have gluten free options as well if you are like me and you wish to avoid those extra wheat products. I highly recommend this place to anybody looking for a happy, welcoming, delicious, and exciting environment to spend your morning (or early afternoon)."}
{"text":"Wow great breakfast place.  It's a relatively small family run restaurant with a very friendly atmosphere. All 4 of us had great dishes, even my two picky kids!

We had raspberry pancakes, a basic bacon and eggs dish, a sausage, potato and egg scrambler, and their special, the San Francisco Scrambler.  All were very tasty and big portions.  Their toast was great and comes with a delicious strawberry jam.

I would definitely  recommend the San Fran scrambler, but sub the ground beef for chorizo...really great dish!"}
{"text":"We had an outstanding breakfast here. There was a 30 minute wait before we were seated, but definitely worth the wait. Our table had the deep fried French toast, an omelette, and the chicken fried chicken combo (amazing). If you are trying to eat healthy, this is not your place, but the  service was excellent and the food delicious. A definite 5 star!!"}
{"text":"I came here based off the yelp reviews. A little pricy for a breakfast spot in this area. I had the biscuits and gravy with the home fries. Something with the gravy just didn't taste right but the potatoes were very tasty! I will definitely be back to try something else and service was excellent. All of the employees smiled and you could tell they really enjoy working here."}
{"text":"Ok I was in town and was searching for a place for breakfast and it suggested this place. When I walked in I literally felt like I was back home in NJ. It has that atmosphere that welcomes you. The food is amazing they had this Reindeer sausage that they import from Alaska... all I have to say is..; Im lost for words because it something I've never had but its only seasonal though, glad I came in. You have to come here and bring a family its that good!"}
{"text":"This place is the absolute best with out a doubt.the food is original the service is top notch and its worth every penny. Denny's ,IHOP or who ever can't even compete.by far my favorite place to eat.I wake up early just to get in there. Except for the 1.25 for an extra slice of bacon ."}
{"text":"I loved the San Francisco style French toast with the strawberries it was like heaven. I was in a food coma when I left this place. I like the brioche bread idea and the fact that they deep fried it so it didn't turn soggy. I Feldman like I was eating a funnel cake. The freshly baked  cinnamon rolls too the frosting tasted like it had cream cheese in it. The staff was friendly."}
{"text":"Had the chicken-fried steak today and it was horrible the gravy tasted like paste. No flavor at all. Breakfast is very expensive even though it indicates on Yelp that it a cheap place to go. $4 for an orange juice is a little high if you ask me."}
{"text":"Customers for life! Wonderful family, wonderful food, we love OBH. Divina is our favorite server :) Always a wait, but its well worth it!"}
{"text":"Came here based on Yelpers' recommendations. Great family brunch place. The food is very very very very good. Fresh squeezed orange juice - can't get enough. The San Francisco style French toast gets a flash fried treatment that gives it a nice crunchy coating. My hubby ordered blueberry pancakes - the hint of citrus taste makes it extra special. The place gets busy on Sundays...but the staff is really good in getting the tables ready as soon as patrons leave. Our server was very nice and checked on us frequently. This is our new brunch place!!!"}
{"text":"Tradition American food done right.  Just had breakfast there. 
Silverware - CLEAN
Water -  GOOD no funny tastes.
Wait staff - ON THEIR GAME and friendly. 
Order came quite fast.

I was surprised to see how busy the place was so late on a tuesday morning,  A testament to the quality of the staff and food.

I had: Chicken Fried Steak, 2 eggs over hard, toast, 2 pancakes.

ALL was cooked perfectly.
The toast came with Strawberry Jam they make!  Seasoning was good on all items.

I WILL be back."}
{"text":"The first time we came here a couple of weeks ago, we decided to hold off on our review because there were a few flaws with our experience but we hoped we could give them the benefit of the doubt and try a second time. We are SO glad we did.

The staff are all very pleasant and make for a positive experience as soon as you walk in the door. The portion sizes are plenty of food to fill you up at very reasonable prices. Coffee was wonderful, exactly what a nice breakfast brew should be. The eggs have been perfectly cooked on both plates both times we were there. And the fresh squeezed orange juice just CAN'T be beat. VERY pulpy which for me is a huge plus. Also, their cinnamon rolls are outstanding; large and fluffy with just the right amount of sweetness.

The biscuit gravy, unfortunately left a lot to be desired. It had a sweet quality that I've never had in breakfast gravy and didn't work for me at all. The hashbrowns, while good, not too oily/butter and reasonably salted, are pretty inconsistent. The first time we went, we had one order that was very overdone and another order that was very underdone while the second time we went, the one order we had was just right.

I can't speak to the french toast, though I know it's something they're known for and it's definitely something I plan to try. Not the best breakfast joint in the world but a more than satisfactory experience that is well worth the money."}
{"text":"After one visit, I have decided this is my go to place for breakfast. Very reasonable price, good food, great service. I couldn't find one thing that they need to improve on. Hopefully they will extend their hours in the future."}
{"text":"I came to this place with my 3 year old daughter and we loved it!  First off, the food was great!  But what sets this place above is the very pleasant service.  Also, my daughter can be a bit of a handful when she is tired (we had just came from the playground and she had been riding in the bike trailer for a good portion of the morning), but the staff were very friendly and understanding and even played with her a bit.  Admittedly, it was a MOnday morning, so it was a bit slow, so not many people for my kid to annoy (if there had been I would have gotten her out of there so as not to ruin other peoples breakfasts).  

I will definitely be back!  Probably with my wife this time too!"}
{"text":"Very good tamale and egg breakfast with a side of GF pancakes.  Server Emily was extremely helpful in helping me sort through the menu to avoid my food sensitivities and come up with this great menu choice.  I also appreciated how upbeat she was with all her customers.  A little expensive for me, but not unlike many other popular breakfast places in the valley."}
{"text":"Great service and great people.. food is good and will defiantly be back!!
I recommend this place to all!
Last time we went it was just a few min wait, always a good place to wait if needed.. they do get a bit busy"}
{"text":"Great Home Style breakfasts!  Fresh hand squeezed OJ that they will refill one time for free!

Any breakfast place that has hand squeezed fresh oj is an automatic winner!

The beakfast experience just got better from there.  Great coffee, n they leave the insulated coffee pot on yur table so u can refill at yur leisure

All staff was extremely friendly and attentive. 
I had the delicious french toast, bacon n eggs, my daughter had \"Juan's Tacos\"-simple chorizo n egg mixture with perfectly cooked hash browns; my wife had the chilaquilles-a spicy number of mexican goodness

No one had any room for the delectable looking homemade cinnamon rolls. Have to hit that next time!

Definetly worth bookmarking!"}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast and got served raw eggs. Will not be going back"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this special place one day while working.  The service was great.  The staff was friendly and quick to please.  The coffee is fantastic here.  So great i would come just for a cup.  The prices I thought were a bit on the high side until the food came.  Portions are huge, and the flavors are worth it.  John really knows how to please."}
{"text":"I have driven past this restaurant so many times, always saying to myself that I should give it a try. Finally did and was glad I did. 
The place was packed and more waiting outside.
I ordered the special, a lump crab omelet...yum!. I had the pancakes with the omelet and wished I could have finished them. There was just a hint of lemon zest to them...delicious! My friend's meal came with three large slices of bacon and she graciously offered one to me...great stuff!
I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Place is solid. French toast and pancakes are very good love the banana pecan. Like supporting local small business owners. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Our first visit to this place was great. Very clean, friendly service, and good food. I'm a bacon snob but I must say their bacon was perfect! I had the small French toast plate which was just enough food because one slice of French toast is huge! It's crispy fried sourdough french toast which sounds different but was absolutely delicious! My fiancé had the 5 egg white scramble and loved it but again tons of food, he couldn't eat the whole thing. Orange juice is fresh squeezed (you can literally watch the kids squeezing it) so it's pulpy but has the great fresh flavor. Overall, awesome! We will definitely be back! Ask for Jocelyn's section."}
{"text":"Without a doubt the best breakfast place around!   We love their selection and amazing service!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing!  I was really impressed with the pancakes in my opinion they are the best in the valley light and fluffy and they had just a hint of lemon. 
Even my kids who are really picky eaters happily gobbled up there macaroni and cheese chicken nuggets and pancakes. 
My wife ordered a salad and she said it was excellent. I would also want to mention they have fresh squeezed orange juice it was very good and totally worth the $3.75. I would like to give them a perfect five star rating however we went there late on a Sunday afternoon and I found the men's room to be dirtier than expected and therefore I only gave them four stars."}
{"text":"We are always looking for new places to go for breakfast and found this one on Yelp. It did not disappoint. Great service and great food. Get there before 9am on the weekend or be prepared to wait. Great selections for both my wife and I and our children. Give it a try you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic place for brunch. We were seated promptly (granted it was a weekday a little before 11) and our server immediately came by to get our drink orders. 
I got the French toast combo with sausage and eggs. It was a ton of food and everything was awesome. I don't know how they prepared the French toast, but it was a combination of soft and crispy. 
My girlfriend got the blueberry pancakes and they too were great. 

Prices were reasonable, especially given quality of the food and serving size. Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Great local place to have breakfast. Visiting from New Hampshire and was looking to find a different flavor for breakfast at OBH really delivered! Everything on the menu you'd ever want and more. Think creatively and you can get a huge breakfast at a great price!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! Wonderful food n Great staff! Service is fantastic! The french toast is amazing. I like the daily specials as well. Lunch has always been a nice treat. Prices are fair. Casual too. Some of us rolled out of bed and came straight here lol."}
{"text":"The word that comes to mind is gratuitous. The portion size, the amount of frosting on the cinnamon roll, the thick slices of French toast dripping with strawberries, the sauce, garlic, and cheese on the eggs... You get the point. 

The result was tons of food that tasted fresh and absolutely indulgent. My only complaint is that it was so good I ate myself sick."}
{"text":"One of the best in town.   Definitely best in the area.   Only draw back is they aren't open till 3 closing at 2 doesn't work much for me since I get off work at 2 :)"}
{"text":"This was quite a surprise. I am always a little leery about breakfast places. The food was excellent and the service outstanding. I would definitely go here again if I am in the area.  If you're looking for French Toast and love funnel cakes from the fair, this us the place for you."}
{"text":"I was looking to try something new for breakfast today, and I found OBH here on yelp.  It turned out to be very close to home, so I headed over to try it out.  What I found was a nice place with very friendly people.

What impressed me the most was that my waitress Hayley was very accommodating to my dietary needs.  I'm lactose intolerant, so I need to limit my dairy intake to small portions.  She substituted ham for eggs, and made sure my toast was dry, providing a small cup of jam instead.  She pointed out that the hash browns were fried in butter, making sure that was ok.  I liked the fact that the coffee came in a small insulated carafe so I didn't have to chase Hayley for refills.

The owner John was present, and introduced himself.  It's always nice to meet the proprietor of an establishment, and I appreciated that he welcomed me to his place, and shook my hand.

Lastly at the checkout I spent a couple of minutes talking with Justin, and Courtney.  We were discussing how I found them on Yelp, and they asked if I was going post about them.  I've never reviewed anyone on Yelp before, but they were all so friendly I thought sure why not.  So I took their picture, and if I can figure out where to attach it I will do so.

Overall I'm giving them a 4 out of 5 stars.  In reality I'd say it's more like a 4.5, but there doesn't appear to be a half star option.  I'd give them 5, but hey nobody is perfect.  I figure this way it gives them something to shoot for.  Oh and my apologies if I got anyone's name wrong.  I'm very bad with names."}
{"text":"After passing by this almost every week we finally came in for breakfast. This is not the greasy diner I would have expected,the food is fresh and has lots of flavor. 

The menu has more options than most places and the food is mostly from local sources and taste very fresh.

We had a scramble and an omelet both were veggie and they were great. The vegetables in both tasted and looked very fresh. Both plates had a good portion of food and left us both full. 

The coffee was also good,it is a light roast and smooth."}
{"text":"Our family absolutely LOVES this place! Great food and great people! My husband enjoys the Chicken Fried Chicken every time. I usually get the Popeye omelette or the deep fried french toast... You can't go wrong with either one. This is the only place we go for breakfast because it is the best. The staff is so nice and up beat, it seems like they are happy to being working there. We have also celebrated birthdays here as well and the complementary French Toast sundae is AMAZING and so worth the extra calories!"}
{"text":"This place is a family favorite and we come often. I love the Big Ol Scramble and Chili Cheese Omelet. When I splurge I get a homemade cinnamon roll to go (breakfast #2?). I personally don't care for their fresh squeezed oj- it's just too pulpy for my liking, but I know it's a fan favorite. Beware the pancakes have an orange/lemon zest thing going on and me and my kids don't care for that too much but the French toast is so good! The staff is always extremely friendly and the owners walk around and say hello. There will always be a line on weekend mornings (unless you plan to get there EARLY) but it's worth it."}
{"text":"We found this little breakfast place by looking on yelp, and we were so impressed! They have delicious homemade scones and brioche cinnamon rolls, and their pancakes have a hint of lemon in them- totally unexpected but amazing! I've started making my own pancakes this way. I've tried several other menu items and never been disappointed. This is now where I take my out of town guests and where I meet friends. Great place and great food!"}
{"text":"Been eying this place for awhile but its always sooo packed that I hate waiting  when I'm hungry!  So this Saturday morning we decided to order takeout, ready in 10 minutes= AWESOMENESS! 
The only complaint I have is my husbands omelette was supposed to be eggwhites but wasn't. EVERYTHING else was DELICIOUS!  You can definitely tell the ingredients were fresh and  homemade! Their bread was sliced thick, OJ was  soooo yummy and the BlackBerry FrenchToast was sweet but with the sourdough bread/zest not overwhelming! Plus the bacon was crispy just the way I love it!
Cannot wait to try something new next time we go! Maybe we'll try lunch next time!"}
{"text":"My wife requested breakfast for her birthday. We looked on Yelp and discovered Original Breakfast House and were excited to try it out since it has amazing reviews. 

My wife wanted make sure breakfast was available until close, so she called twice that morning (July 16th). No answer, but she figured it was a busy morning so they couldn't answer and she wanted to go anyway.

We drove out (about 25 minutes) with our 8 month old with us, and when we arrived the sign said closed for vacation. While we completely understand this is a family run business and of course the family should go on vacation, we can't understand why a business wouldn't change their voice mail to let potential customers know they are closed. 

We would love to have tried out the food, but didn't get the chance. In the future, please change your voicemail to reflect when you are closed. Not everyone who wants to try your restaurant lives right around the corner where a quick drive to find out you're closed wouldn't be a big deal."}
{"text":"I drive by this place every Sunday on my way to church, and for quite a while have been saying, \"Some day I need to stop and have breakfast there!\"  Well, this morning was the day, and all I can say is, \"Jackpot!!\"  I will definitely be back!

My breakfast, though \"simple\" (basic 2 scram, x-crispy bac, wheat toast & fresh fruit), was as satisfying in every aspect.  There's not much I can add to all the food complements from other reviewers here; I can only endorse and reiterate them.  You won't be disappointed!

What I would like to add is an extra complement from the restaurant management angle - something you don't always see on Yelp.

I took a counter seat right next to the kitchen.  Normally, because of noise and staff coming in and out right by you, that's a bad place to be.  Not in this case, because it gave me a bird's eye view of what an incredibly efficient, well-run place this is!

1. Everything organized in back.  All supplies, containers, dishware, what-have-you, neatly arranged on easy-access shelving, not a thing out of place.  With the level of activity at breakfast on Sunday morning, this area could easily get out of hand, with things in disarray.  Not here.  My own kitchen should look so well-organized!

2.  Clean as a whistle.  Again, with the hubbub and frantic pace, it would be understandable to have spills on the floors, shelves, counters, etc.  Spotless.  Looks like they just opened for their first day ten minutes ago.  To repeat, oh, that I should keep my own kitchen, for one person, looking so clean and tidy.

3.  Wait and bus staff HUSTLES!  No one is standing around not paying attention - these gals and guys are in perpetual motion!  I got tired just watching them.  

4. Owner right there and involved.  Not lording it over his staff, but right there at their side, doing whatever needs to be done, whether it's bringing out an order, showing a party to their table, you name it - he's in the thick of it!

5. Fast and friendly!  I always allow extra time when trying a new place, because you just never know, but I was served within 3 or 4 minutes of placing my order, and on my way with lots of time to spare.  All staff were friendly and attentive.  The crew here deserves high accolades.

I look forward to many more visits."}
{"text":"Not sure why this has so many 5 star ratings. The cinnamon roll was very good, but the French Toast special was horrible. it was dry in the middle and very greasy. Tasted like it had been fried in oil.  The hog heaven omelet was decent but the hash browns were too greasy. The pancakes from the kids menu ended up being the tastiest choice. Could only be bothered to come back for the cinnamon roll, nothing else was worth it."}
{"text":"Food was awful, waitress wanted us to leave.  Biscuits and gravy were perhaps the worst I have ever tasted, hash brown tasted like they were boiled, the bacon was really good however.  Won't be going back.  They were very friendly when I arrived, the waitress was friendly, just ready for us to move on."}
{"text":"Best breakfast spot! Great friendly staff! The coffee is delicious, fresh squeezed orange juice! Cage free eggs, organic milk and hormone free 100% black angus beef! Locally roasted fair trade coffee!"}
{"text":"We like to support locally owned small businesses, and this place is great! They have the BEST coffee, roasted here in Tempe. The most delicious French toast we've ever had! Fresh squeezed o.j. (with lots of pulp), organic milk and produce plus cage free eggs are all part of what sets this place apart from other breakfast places. 
I'm sure we'll be back often!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the food is probably a solid 4 stars but the service was probably the best I've ever experienced at a breakfast place.  Everyone from the servers to the hostesses to the bus people were awesome and therefore the 5 star review.

I ate the big gooey mess dish and my wife got the French toast.  

We will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing! A breakfast brunch place NOT to miss! We had the banana pecan French toast and the special corn beef and eggs. Holy cow, so tasty and yummy!! We had to wait 45 minutes and it was worth it. The staff was pleasant and prompt, definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Great place with yummy food! Fun atmosphere and great homemade food. The chicken fried steak and gravy was unreal and the yogart parfait was huge with homemade granola. So yummy and fresh!"}
{"text":"Fresh squeezed OJ was superb. I got the triple berry French toast (the special). It was huge, and delicious. The flavors were wonderful. The other reviews were spot on. The wait staff was friendly and knowledgable."}
{"text":"I finally stopped to have breakfast/lunch and I really liked the ambience and service. Everyone was really nice and attentive. I had the French toast with strawberries and whip. It was delish! The French toast is so thick and flavorful! Probably the best, or one of the best French toasts I have ever had. The strawberries were fresh, and the whip was probably homemade. The place is clean, and like I said earlier--everyone is so nice. I got a little red velvet cupcake when we went to pay, and it was oh-so-yummy as well! I will definitely be going back, and make it a regular place for me since I live nearby. OBH ROCKS!!!"}
{"text":"I'd give zero stars if I could and I fully expect some BS from the owner writing back to me like he has on other reviews.

This place is not worth your time. I should have taken a hint from the woman next to us with her two young sons that my service would be slow since she had to go up to the register to find her food.

Waiting an hour for food that is mediocre at best should never be acceptable.

The waitress recommended Juan tacos. This meal and the potatoes were bland, flavorless and one of the worst I've ever had. I actually preferred a McDonalds burrito over this.

Our waitress came once to give us coffee and take our order and never showed up again. Someone else brought us our food an hour later. We asked for the manager and some snotty kid came over and stated \"I'm sorry\" with an I don't care attitude. He knew he was getting a pay check and that's all that matter to him. When we got to the front counter, the cashier was kinder than the manager.

We asked for the owner since it had slowed down by the time we FINALLY got our food. We waited fifteen minutes because we were told he was coming over and he NEVER showed.

The worst part was three tables came in after us and left long before us. It was completely unacceptable. I will never be back and I will never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Chicken fried steak and eggs was probably overdoing it for breakfast. Husband had the spam and egg plate. Overall we felt like it was ok. Maybe we should've had our usual breakfast favorites for a better comparison but from this first visit we were stuffed to the brim."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and attentive service.  They have a good kids menu along with fresh OJ in a kids size.  I had the French toast combo with eggs and bacon.  French toast is a must try!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best breakfast places on earth!  I live only a couple miles away, and this is a regular treat for us.  The staff has barely any turnover, and everyone has a perma-smile, and as friendly as can be!  They get to know you and chat with you like an old friend when you come in.  And then there's the FOOD!!!!!  OMG!!!!  Nothing, absolutely NOTHING is bad there!  The chiliquiles are an absolute fave, and always get 2 meals out of it (it's HUGE!), as well as the always changing farmer's market omelette.  The peso brussel sprout omelette is amazing, and I never liked brussel sprouts!  Ha, go figure!  They use only cage-free eggs, and the freshest ingredients, it's impressive!

This location has changed hands so many times over the 10 years I've lived near it, and this is the only place that has stuck, and with as busy as it always is, I don't think they're going anywhere, and I hope they never do!!!!!  The owner walks around and greets everyone, and even buses tables himself!

Keep up the amazing work guys, it shows!!!"}
{"text":"Quality comfort food with polite and efficient service. . While things can go astray, how an establishments handles the mishap makes a world of difference. In my case, the server handled herself and the situation perfectly.  This past weekend there was a mishap with the availability of a table. The server apologized for the mix up and made sure I got the next available table and offered a baked good for the trouble. The only negative about OBH is that the wait on weekends for breakfast can be 30+ minutes. There are a couple of benches inside to sit and wait , but most have to site outside until called for their table. It would be nice if they used a waiting app to avoid sitting outdoors when it's really hot."}
{"text":"Great place! The morning crew is friendly and fast. They greet you with big, shiny smiles. The food is good and the plates are ample - expect large portions. The place is small-ish, and super packed on a Saturday morning. People are waiting outside, sitting on the lawn or the chairs. The hostess takes your name and will walk outside to call your name after a short wait. 
The coffee is not good. 
The pancakes are delicious!
Pleasant ambiance."}
{"text":"Indeed there's really nothing disappointing to say about Original Breakfast House. Im the type to order breakfast any time of the day if thats how I'm feeling. My friends were skeptical about my order of hog heaven (omelette) with pancakes but OMG it was sooooooooo freaking delicious!"}
{"text":"The French toast was the best I every had. Bacon thick crispy and delicious! Service was good. We were a party of 5 satisfied customers"}
{"text":"Quite a few restaurants have opened and closed in this building, but I really hope this one stays!  Our server was very friendly and attentive, and the prices were reasonable.  I ordered the corned beef hash, which was homemade and honestly the best I've had!  The jam was homemade as well, and delicious. 

Our server even added some requests to our kids choices, which weren't on the menu.  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This OBH has been our \"go-to\" breakfast oasis since I can remember! We have brought friends from out of town and raved about it to family. Today we were pleased to find that at the bar counter-top there were 2 open seats (which is first come first serve), the seats were not next to one an other but we were able to arrange them together. Nick, the owners son, caused a scene and moved us remotely to a corner. As we tried to apologize and help him move us--he got in my husband face and and tried to pick a fight. This was humiliating and shocking. 

We stayed...giving Nick and John (the owners) the benefit of the doubt that it was some kind of misunderstanding. As we left, we asked to speak to the the father (John) to let him know that the way Nick spoke to us was not right and disrespectful. In turn Nick came out and started a scene all over again, this time disrespectfully speaking to both my husband & I, even saying he did not need our business. We were baffled and left absolutely disappointed. 

We have always supported & raved about OBH...Their food, their kind staff, and unique dinning experience has always been fantastic. This kind of humiliation and disrespect has driven us to not only ever want to go back... But let other people know... To not move chairs because apparently it's a big NO NO at this place and you might leave in shock!! Unfortunately if Nick ends up running this place, he will run it to the ground. Professionalism, customer service, and plain human kindness are key to running a successful business my fiend! None of which you possess."}
{"text":"Found this great breakfast place on Yelp!  What a treat!    I had the El Paseo omelet.  Such a flavorful combination!  The service was great.  They also have baked goodies!  I got a Cranberry Orange Scone to go and had it later that day. It was awesome.  I would rate this place in my favorite 3 breakfast places in the Phoenix area.  You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I am glad you went on a vacation..  Maybe let people know before I have to drive bring my family (their vacation).  I called multiple times and received a message.  Except the message said nothing about being closed .  In the time that I have started writing this 20ish or so people have parked and walked to your door.  Thank you ......"}
{"text":"The cinnamon rolls are heaven..they alone receive 5 stars from me!! However, the service to me was just ok. We got seated and about 5 minutes later our server came over. My friend needed additional time and then about ten minutes later she came and took our orders. I had the French toast special. The French toast were amazing, but my eggs were in edible. I ordered then scrambled well and what I got were hard slightly burnt eggs. If she ever checked on us after we got to taste the food I would have told her this issue, but next time she came by was to drop the check and leave. I usually agree with all yelp reviews but this place didn't live up to the 4.5 stars! Overall the food was 3 stars and the service was 2 because the girls at check out are amazing! I probably only come back for a cinnamon roll n to try milkshake Mondays since I love me a good milkshake"}
{"text":"YUM!  I like this place alot!  I went with my son.  I had a special (green chile tamale with two eggs, potatoes, and black beans); he had their signature french toast.  Mine was excellent, but after a bite of his french toast I wish I had his!!  There is alot of love for food here.  It is a busy place so plan for a wait.  The place lost one star just due to its business and pricing was slightly higher than some of the other breakfast places in the area.  I am coming back however!!  OFTEN!!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for locally sourced food and something a little different this is your breakfast place. Wonderful food and a great staff."}
{"text":"Doesn't get any fresher or home than this
 Went with a local, otherwise I would not have known about this desert jewel. Fantastic server gave me the perfect recommendation not on the menu. Bacon, asparagus, feta omlett. Then I saw a giant cinnamon roll come to the next table. Too full to get that too. I'll be back on my next visit just for that."}
{"text":"So Delicious! Decided to make my first visit based upon the yelp reviews and now I am hooked! Friendly Staff, Excellent Service and  super tasty food!"}
{"text":"Fantastic.  Worth the 30 minute drive. Had huevos rancheros verde with poached eggs and it was just absolutely delicious with good heat. Waitstaff were very friendly, always smiling and attentive.  I'll be back when I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Second visit, love this place. Food is very good, great atmosphere and excellent service."}
{"text":"The place was awesome! Pulled pork hash and pecan French toast... Wait staff super friendly."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Friendly staff, great food and reasonable prices! Definitely would recommend the original breakfast house to others !"}
{"text":"Seriously this is the best breakfast place ever! They have the best food and the friendliest staff ever! We drive all the way from peoria to enjoy obh! You have forever changed our expectations of breakfast! If you ever open a location in the west valley we would be your best customers! Thank you for the best breakfast ever!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, great atmosphere and the big breakfast sandwich was amazing. I would visit weekly if I lived in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I would give this place four stars but I haven't yet enjoyed the coffee. The home made orange juice is a treat and comes with a complimentary refill that you can take out if you like. I've enjoyed lemon curd pancakes and an omelet that featured prickly pear cactus. The environment is low key and cool and the wait staff are very friendly. One of my favorite breakfast jaunts."}
{"text":"This is now my absolute favorite breakfast place!!! The best pancakes and to top it off they have spam and Portuguese sausage!!!"}
{"text":"We just got done eating here today (July 4th) and the food was amazing! Very tasty food and great options and very friendly staff! On top of all that they paid for our breakfast as a thank you for my husbands service, it was very unexpected and we are beyond grateful to them! We will definitely be eating here again!"}
{"text":"Drove by several times and took note of the inviting atmosphere.  Tried ORIGINAL BREAKFAST HOUSE for the first time this morning... Holy Crap!  The food, the place and especially the people have now made this my new favorite place to have breakfast.  Very pleasantly surprised.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Great food. Huge portions. Busy place, but fast & friendly service. We'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast. Again. Linguica was excellent. Very pleasant service.  Very quick as  well. Got a wonderful greeting from Brittany the hostess with a smile that could melt steel. Gina was very friendly and gave excellent service. Can't beat this place."}
{"text":"First time visit so limited input but so far so great! Green Chili Pork omelette was excellent. Coffee simple but surprisingly good. Brioche bun great. 
Service: quick and friendly. 
Food:  well above average. Creative dishes as well as classic offerings with sizable portions. 
Ambiance: cool buzz, not quite loud, just lively. 
Cleanliness:  All good nothing to note which is perfect for me. 
Of note: it can look intimidating when the line starts but this place is well staffed. Staff seems well trained and able to succeed in this environment."}
{"text":"The French toast is amazing. All of their batter has a hint of lemon to it which I think is fantastic but my wife hates. Fresh orange is great but the glass is small and you only get one refill. The wait time can be long but that is due to the great food. Service is hit or miss."}
{"text":"Love this breakfast place! Nice home cooking vibes! Biscuits and gravy are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here today for the first time, and was pretty surprised at the food! It was all very good especially the fresh squeezed orange juice!!!
Prices were great and the amount of food was a lot!! I would def eat there again and recommend it anyone looking for a good breakfast place!"}
{"text":"On our way back to Cali, we gave The Original Breakfast House a try because of their great reviews. Oh boy! We were glad we did. The OBH exceptional homemade breakfast entrees. We had fresh squeezed orange juice, triple berry french toast, and blueberry pancakes and were Wowed by the food and the service. If you're in the area I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday around 11am the wait was 20-25 minutes which did not bother us.  Almost all breakfast places have a wait.  Our waitress was Teresa and she was great a beautiful personality.  The food was really good next time we come to Arizona we will make sure to stop by.  
I got scrambled eggs with mushroom, spinach
My husband got the chilaquiles
Our friend got the juans tacos 
Everyone enjoyed their meal."}
{"text":"Very good bfast. Table had the fried chicken, pancakes and the biscuits and gravy. Everything was cooked to order and delicious. Very nice that they serve breakfast all day. We will return."}
{"text":"Looking for a great breakfast and relied on YELP. A little out of our way, going home to Vegas but it was a learning experience. The place was still crowded at 10 am on a Sunday, good sign, got seated within a half hour.  The staff was friendly and attentive, so a 4 star there; the food was something else. After all the hype we read from the pictures and the previous reviews, we expected better. I had the crab omelet special; it was bland, the hollandaise sauce had no taste and it was just crab meat with minimal amount of cheese added to it. The home fries were burnt or over cooked (I looked and seen other plates and this was the norm); very disappointing. My spouse had the French Toast with strawberries. It looked good upon presentation, but the crust was unedible, like it was deep fried or something. We also ordered a side  rib eye steak and that was over cooked. All and all, IHOP would have been a better place to have breakfast. So over all, a 3 star and that's being nice."}
{"text":"The Friday night fish fry is outrageous! The Fish Fry menu provides several excellent choices and the additional daily specials are very tempting as well.  

Last night was my first visit for the fish fry and I wasn't disappointed. I've had breakfast and lunch on many occasions and now I'll make a point of making it to the Friday fish fries. Great restaurant and great staff!"}
{"text":"Super friendly servers.  Fast service.  Had over easy eggs with sausage. Food was cooked well. And the sausage was home made and not out of a package..  Also tried the homemade hash which was also very good.   The reason for five star is the combo of super friendly people and homemade style breakfast."}
{"text":"This breakfast place serves great food at realistic prices and brings it to you with pleasant, hospitable service.

My initial thought before arriving was that this place might end up being a bad clone of the Original Pancake House in Scottsdale. I was thrilled to see a menu that is decidedly progressive and interesting that in some ways out-shines the OPH. The brioche cinnamon rolls are absolutely out of this world. If these rolls were the only saving grace, this place would still be a winner in my book. But the omelettes (she had the Popeye sans bacon and onion; I had the Chili Cheese) were perfectly cooked (slightly more-done than other places) and came with sides that included the gluten free banana pancakes and the chocolate chip pancakes. Even the hash-browns were crispier and more thoughtfully prepared than at some other places. 

Add to all this that they serve the Valley's own Cortez Coffee and genuinely freshly-squeezed OJ, and you have yourself one of the best places in PHX for breakfast. 

I would be thrilled to see what variation OBH would make on OPH's famous Apple Pancake. Gluten free? Hint hint..."}
{"text":"Although this place is always busy, it is worth the wait. I love you pecan banana pancakes."}
{"text":"Fresh squeezed Orange juice, good food, good menu packed on Sunday nice place Family Owned I'm sure all eat here again"}
{"text":"The place itself is nice and homey but the floors were a little dirty but it could be from children that come in. This is the first time I've been here since my gf said she heard great reviews of the food and service so we thought we would give it a shot. This is my first yelp review btw. First off the greeting was warm and welcoming there was a wait but not that long and we even got a booth by the window and believe me you want to sit here because I think this was just the lucky area. We seemed to get a food before other tables who we're complaining about the wait. I had the chicken fried steak and my gf had the French toast and it would of been worth the wait if it came to that. Our server recommended the chicken since the gravy tastes delicious and she sold my gf on the French toast calling it crispy crunchy deliciousness and it was definitely that. I'm not quite sure our servers name to give her some praise but she was in the front and great I think it was des so good job! A busser came up to the table and took away some of our plates and she even came back with a box for the French toast. When we went to pay the host at the front made some small talk with me and it just made both of us feel so welcomed here. So good job original breakfast house! I will be back"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love coming to this place! The food is always so good and they have such an amazing customer service! We are literally here every Sunday! I recommend this place if you are looking for some delicious breakfast!"}
{"text":"I kept hearing from friend about how great this place was so one day I decided to come with and it was a great decision! 

I had the French toast which was great but I think the sausage and eggs were even better! The coffee was great as well. 

The best part is the service. We kept asking for more things and she was always very nice and positive the whole time. Good overall experience, although it was kind of hot inside the restaurant. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on Saturday morning of the fourth of July weekend. Busy, but no wait time. The staff was great, and the service was quick. The food did not disappoint. Their pancakes are outstanding. Everything was prepared well, and tasted very good. I would recommend this place, and have no reservations  in returning."}
{"text":"Awesome food and great service!  Everything except for the french fries were top notch.  I got to sample many different breakfast items and all I can say is super yummy!"}
{"text":"We tried this place out this morning. I had the banana pecan pancakes, they were huge. I added eggs and meat. The bacon was a nice cut and the sausage had great flavor. The service was good. I would have liked to have seen corned beef hash and eggs benedict on the menu, but that is just my opinion. Overall it was good and reasonably priced. I am sure we will be back."}
{"text":"I've tried several breakfast and lunch items and liked them all. I knocked this down to a 4 star for not having espresso based drinks, which to me for a breakfast place is a cardinal sin. Their house coffee is better than Folgers, but definitely not my cup of joe. They have some very innovative items on the menu to their credit. Bottom line - I have returned and will continue to return, after I have had good coffee at home."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast! Exceptional level of service and food is made to order hot & fresh... the pancakes have a hint of lemon, French toast was the best ever tasted with the fried chicken & sausage gravy..."}
{"text":"A great meal to start the day!  The Original Breakfast House had a lot of choices for anyone's palate.  I had the El Paso omelette with potatoes and a biscuit. The potatoes were nice and crispy and the omelette had some chorizo and black beans in it. The meal overall was flavorful and I enjoyed it very much. I will definitely be back to try other items from the menu. The service as well was very attentive and nice."}
{"text":"First time visiting this spot today with my family and I couldn't say enough good things about it. The food was AMAZING, price was good for portion size and the service was also great,  thanks to our server Nichole. Only bad thing today was there was also a car show in their parking lot so that made parking a hassle, but I wouldn't ding them for that next time ill just check for current events first. We had about a 30 min wait but it was totally worth it. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Love coming here when we get the bug to get out of the house for breakfast.  They have amazing fresh squeezed OJ and I personally love their French toast. I've never gone wrong with that combo."}
{"text":"Wow!  Was having a really bad morning and found this place on Yelp!  So glad I did!  It exceeded my expectations from the second I opened the door!  Very friendly greeting, great food and service!!!"}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast in Phoenix.  Had the Linguica & Eggs.  Big portion, should have shared."}
{"text":"I keep coming back because you won't find breakfast like this anywhere else. The menu is full of variety, and I never know what to choose! Everything taste so fresh and flavorful. The green chile is incredible. Add it to your eggs or burritos and it will blow you away. Favorite breakfast place in phoenix!! OH and the customer service is incredible! The staff is BEYOND friendly. I'd recommend this place to anyone for sure. They are always kind to accommodate to your dietary needs."}
{"text":"Excellent!!!! It is our new go-to breakfast joint. I've tried four different items now and each one gets better and better. The warm cinnamon rolls are delicious! 

My husband LOVES the French toast, gets it every time. And they have fresh squeezed orange juice too!

But beware, the weekends are busy! So be prepared to wait 45 min, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I came here a few days ago with my dad for breakfast. Everytime I come here I always know I'll get great food and service. Me and my boyfriend love to dine here. It's become our spot for breakfast. The ambiance is so homey I feel like I'm dining in a small town like flagstaff or Sedona. It's nothing fancy at all, and that's what I adore. You can also tell it's not a chained restaurant, the owner and his family are always around to help and greet. The host stand checks up on you as if you were their tables. The food is so delicious. Everything is fantastic. When me and my dad went I ordered a burger with fries and he got scrambled eggs. My dad is a very picky eater and wants his coffee at a certain time. Our server, I forgot her name, but she has awesome purple hair, always was on top of asking my dad if he wanted his coffee yet. Things like that just prove the great service the staff has! I love OBH!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Expect a short wait on the weekends, but it's worth it. When it comes to breakfast food, they know what they're doing. Touch of lemon in their pancakes and a great homemade cinnamon roll. The omelets and hash browns are fantastic. Fresh squeezed orange juice is a must. And the ingredients are mostly organic, fresh, and local. I highly recommend going here!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite breakfast joint. Good food,  reasonably priced,  and a friendly staff. There is nothing on the menu that I don't like. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Wow - can't beat this place for the food and the service. Having moved to the area and being a regular now, I enjoy seeing Dustin and John and Hayley always takes such good care of me and my table. We always bring our out of town friends and they all wish that they had an OBH in their neighborhood. And even though I'm a vegetarian, John (the owner/operator) has great options on the menu, and based upon feedback is changing to vegetarian beans and rice (instead of using chicken stock). 

Love the fact that, even though he's a successful long term restaurateur, he's open to suggestion from his customers. 

With all of the above, he's got a winning combination. 

My very fave breakfast spot!!!"}
{"text":"ALERT: CASH ONLY. This was the best independent breakfast restaurant I've been to in a long time. Nice little touches here and there.  It is cash only but that is reflected in lower prices."}
{"text":"Food was okay.  I prefer country potatoes without that orangish seasoning so disappointed with them.  I had the 5 egg white scramble that would be better as an omelet for better eye appeal and texture.  This was just a white mush with little flavor.  The wheat toast and jam were delicious.  The green chili sauce is also delicious.  The pancakes were okay.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Very good food, along with reasonable prices!
First thing I noticed was all the people waiting to get in and seemingly happy to wait.
Once inside their menu was much more than I was expecting! Had some decent gluten free choices, along with several imaginative choice both for breakfast and lunch. 
Reasonable prices, great selections, and very nice staff.  :)
Will definitely be heading back to this one!!"}
{"text":"I had just gotten out of doing my nails this past Saturday and was craving brunch. Free Saturdays haven't been on my plate for a while until this year, so I love to enjoy brunch every so often, even if it's alone.

Of all the sort of near-ish brunch places, OBH won out by a mile. It's in a silly, old little strip mall where there's some kind of church and from what other reviews say, Alice Cooper's Teen center. Go figure. But don't let the surroundings fool you- this place really is a gem. It was packed when I got in, but the advantage of dining for one is that you often get seats at the bar without waiting. I sat right down and my waitress was prompt and sweet. 

The menu is on the short side, but not lacking in choices- just enough to entertain without overwhelming you. I am a bit disappointed by the lack of brunch cocktails, but not a big deal, there's more time later for debauchery. I'm torn by a few options, but wound up getting the chili cheese omelette and splurge on getting sausage gravy on my biscuit as well. The chili was wonderful, and the omelette crazy fluffy- not too much cheese. Pretty awesome. My fruit was fresh, but honestly the most outstanding thing that day was the sausage gravy. I kid you not, it was creamy and luscious and totally amazing. I'd come back for that sausage gravy! The coffee was... okay. Looking at the reviews on hindsight it almost seems like I should have gotten the orange juice later. 

I read the sign on the way out and see that they get locally grown, in season organic produce for their food. Pretty awesome. Next time I'm back (and I will be back for sure) I'm going to strongarm somebody in my party into getting those pancakes. And maybe the french toast, and other carbohydrate laden things that I won't get for myself but will happily nip off of other people's plates."}
{"text":"Amazing place for breakfast, easily one of the best in Phoenix. The crab omelette during breakfast weekend was out of the world."}
{"text":"Had the triple berry deep fried french toast with eggs & sausage.  The French Toast was amazing! ! Service was great!! 1st time there & I know we will be back."}
{"text":"I got out for breakfast a lot and this is a legit breakfast spot! the fresh squeezed orange juice is great and food is on point and very bright friendly atmosphere. definitely worth a try if you like a good breakfast you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Amazing! Hands down one of the best restaurants for breakfast in North Phoenix. It is clean, the food is delish and out server, Ms. Divina, is fantastic. She went out of her way to ensure we were satisfied! If you want a great experience, sit in her section. The cost is reasonable too - approx $10 a person. Oh, and if u are a hot tea drinker like me, they have an excellent variety to choose from.  The time is 7:48 am and they are already busy!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here today after reading all of the amazing reviews and was extremely disappointed! I had the crab & avocado omelet. I was told the crab was fresh, but it came out smelling fishy with shells mixed into the omelet with it. The avocado in the omelet was more like guacamole than avocado, maybe what they do with the leftover pieces from sandwiches. It also came out cold, as did the coffee.

The people I was dining with ordered the chicken sandwich and the meatloaf special. The meatloaf was covered in a gross thick gravy and the chicken sandwich was extremely dry with no flavor. 

3 people, 3 extremely different meals, all bad. Needless to say, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Our go to breakfast. Just love their syrup. Who knew a little lemon could make syrup taste so exotic. The hash browns can be a little greasy sometimes but I find that to be the same at most restaurants. The Big Breakfast Sandwich could feed two people. The omelette could feed a whole family. The gravy is my favorite. My husband likes their giant sausage links."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. The staff was very polite and checked up on the table at the right time."}
{"text":"Original Breakfast House Review
This place I had first seen open out of the blue.  I have heard of the place when one of the employees came in to my work and talked about it.  I came in about 2 weeks ago about 8:30am on a Wednesday I believe.  Here is my take on it.

Appearance 10/10
The place actually looks quite small from the inside.  However, there were quite a bit of people there even on a weekday morning.  The place looks clean.  No problems

Friendliness 7/10
The crew was great and friendly.  However, I seen a few of them in the back talking to each other.  It can take more than a few moments to get your server's attention in case you needed more syrup or your bill.

Wait Time 9/10
It wasn't bad at all.  We were seated almost immediately.  Our food came between 10-15 after ordering.  Just about normal.

Prices 10/10
The prices were actually quite reasonable!  They even had a deal where they would give you a pancake, egg, and 2 sausages for like 5 bucks.  Cant beat that!

Food 9/10
The food was really good in my opinion.  Their pancakes are quite big and filling.  My dad got two and wasn't able to finish them.  You do get the best value for your money here.

OVERALL 45/50  90% A-
This is a real great place for breakfast.  I haven't tried their lunch or their 2 dollar milkshakes on Mondays.  But overall for a first time, I was very satisfied.  It just so happens it is right by my work so it is very convenient. They have only been open for only a month or so but within time, it can only get better!!  I will be back and highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place great atmosphere amazing food and great service we usually always go to Teresa she's so awesome and friendly we always get our food fresh and right away. Definitely recommend (:"}
{"text":"The Original Breakfast House is one of the best surprises in N. Phoenix!  We have been coming here practically since it opened.  We usually go to OBH on Sundays after church and there is always somewhat of a wait because people have discovered what a wonderful place this is!  The employees are so efficient and the owner, John, is so friendly and and knows what he is doing, so the wait usually ends up being shorter than what you'd expect!

We went to OBH on Sunday, March 12th and had a new server we had never met before!  Her name was Teresa and she was one of the sweetest,  most attentive and accommodating servers we've ever had!  Her sincerity, smile, and knowledge of the menu specials was amazing!  We will ask for her in the future!

And, don't forget the food!  It is amazing!  We have never been disappointed in anything we've ordered here!  They always have delicious creative specials, but, the regular selection on the menu is also outstanding and we have a tough time choosing as there are so many wonderful choices!  Favorites include the cinnamon rolls, many egg dishes, various pancakes and my husband's favorite, the Monte Cristo with plenty of homemade strawberry jam on the side!

The pictures of John's history in the restaurant business is proudly displayed on the wall inside the door and a sign proudly states, \"This ain't my first rodeo\"!  Right now the restaurant is decorated with baseball team banners for the Spring Training season in Phoenix!

We highly recommend OBH for breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"Went there for a free veteran's breakfast and I was so surprised how good the food was. Had the pulled pork hash and eggs and the pulled pork is actually pulled pork. Shockingly good.

The staff was great. They were super busy but the food arrived very fast.

For the past 40 years I've kind of disliked veteran's day because it was a day when other people got off work and businesses used it to sell stuff. I got a little choked up today how nice the staff was, the whole meal was free and the waitress even told the fellow vet I was sitting next to that a tip wasn't necessary. She really meant it. It's not that is was free, it's that they did it with such class. This wasn't a marketing scheme, they really wanted to thank veterans, I don't really know what to say. You made me feel so special like I've never felt. It is something I will never forget. And Veteran's Day for the first time for me was about veterans. I can't thank you enough.

You're now My Restaurant.

They won't say it on their menu or on their web site but when you dine at the Original Breakfast House you are saying thanks to veterans too. So I thank all the diners at Original Breakfast House for helping them make this such a special day for us."}
{"text":"So, I really wanted to like this place. We live like 5 minutes away and were excited to support a small business, however we have had horrible service. We have given it 3 chances and all 3 times poor service, cold food and flies flying by the windows. The first time in the server told us she was tired and the food was ok. We then tried it a few weeks later, with friends and our server was nice but randomly brought me a refill and said \"Don't worry I'm not dirty\". We were silent because this was a very weird thing to say... and randomly. She then said \"I didn't want you to see pen marks on my arms and worry I was serving you while dirty it's just busy\". We all were polite and said no you're fine but couldn't help but joke about that after- who says that? Today we went back with the same couple and we had the server we had our first time in. She was rude, barely spoke to us, slow to refill empty drinks and my fiancé had cold hash browns. We will not be returning- Sorry gave it 3 tries."}
{"text":"OMG - Real people and good food. Incredible choices.

Get the Pecan and Banana Pancakes with the Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice. YUMMY"}
{"text":"Healthy portions of well priced good food. Server was super happy and friendly and atmosphere is great. Went for the French Toast which was quite nice. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Hands down! this place is like going home. They put the love in all they do. I am so glad to let you know OBH is one of the BEST places to eat Steak & eggs. A nice big jucie RIBEYE steak Tender and full of flavor. And not a tiny a nice serving. Thank you OBH Family for feeding us the best food in town!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here today for breakfast and we had an awesome experience.  The hostess and our server, Casey (I think?) were super friendly and warm.  The food portions were huge and quality was great!  We will definitely be back again soon, as the huge menu had so many delicious options... we have to try them all!"}
{"text":"Good food. Should have stuck with breakfast items instead of lunch.  Burger was not bad but not amazing.  Pancakes where amazing and so was potato salad"}
{"text":"Well worth the wait! Be patient and ready to enjoy delicious food when you're seated! There's a reason this place is always packed, the food and service are awesome! I especially enjoy the breakfast burritos and huevos rancheros!"}
{"text":"You have got to try the new Pork Green Chili Omelette. It is so very tasty. I told the owner to keep that in the menu."}
{"text":"Perfect, just perfect breakfast spot. Visiting the area from PA and used Yelp reviews to find this gem. The French toast was as amazing as other reviews indicated. I guess you really can't go wrong with great sourdough, custard-like egg dip and the deep frying. Delish! 
My husband said the pancakes were \"the best he ever had!\" you can taste the orange zest and it was light and yet filling. 
We also had the Juan's tacos -- they were satisfying and quintessentially southwest breakfast. 
BUT the best part was the Patty's brioche cinnamon buns. Holy Amazing."}
{"text":"As always the food here was great, service is fast and friendly and the place clean and inviting. My favorite part about this place is, they leave the coffee container at the table. My least favorite part, and this is just a personal preference and in no way changes my positive review, they put a little orange zest in the pancakes.
PS... the coffee is amazing.
Try this place out, you won't wait long and you will be full and happy when you leave."}
{"text":"Only rating the breakfast, as I haven't eaten here for any other meals, but this is one of the best spots in the valley for breakfast.  The French toast is delicious."}
{"text":"This is a great place for all your breakfast needs. They have such a variety for everyone's liking. I first went here for my Birthday breakfast get together and they accommodated 12 of us so fast even with a huge line out the door. The owner and staff are always so nice and smiling and attentive. The second time I went was with some friends and again 100% service and food. I will be coming back again and again and highly recommend this place to anyone!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I frequent the breakfast company frequently the food is excellent and high-end fresh products the homemade jelly is to die for.... great place to take out-of-towne guests"}
{"text":"I can't even wait to write this review!!! Waiting on our check and I just had to write this! We are from Los Angeles and so I had to hop on Yelp to find a breakfast spot... Soooooo glad I did!!! We are here to visit the Mayo Clinic for my father and this place is not even 10 minutes away... It's AMAZING starting off with our greeting (ZOEY is AWESOME especially with my son!) and they have a box of toys to keep my 1 year old busy which they wipe all the toys down after each child. For any mom that goes a long long way!!! And we did get KIMBERLY and yes she is AWESOME!!!!! Very attentive and her smile just makes your day!!! Food is sooooo good and yes the French toast is plus plus plus!!!! This is a MUST visit place! We went really late so we didn't have to wait but I see why this place would be busy from open to close! Thank you for contributing to our pleasant trip here"}
{"text":"Great place with fresh food always, love the freshly squeezed orange juice. Very pleased with the service and how quickly the food comes. Thank you for always being so great."}
{"text":"Best pancakes. Real food, organic and locally grown. Great staff. Can't wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"We were in town for a football game and needed a good place for breakfast.  Looked around Yelp and although OBH was a little further than I wanted to drive, this place was worth every mile! From the moment we walked in, we were treated with kindness and attentiveness.  Our server, Emily, was one of the best servers we have ever had at ANY restaurant.  She was someone who spoke with a smile and looked like she really loved her job.  Her attitude and spirit made our breakfast just that much more enjoyable.  Now the food was off the charts.  Both my mom and I ordered omelets.  Omelets are hit and miss as most places overcook and burn eggs, not OBH.  The omelet was cooked perfectly and the amount of ingredients was spot on.  Whenever I am in town, OBH will place I always go!"}
{"text":"My dad and I are staying at the JW Marriott in Pheonix and we were looking for a different breakfast place, rather than the typical Denny's. I found this place on Yelp and it was the BEST breakfast I've had in a long time. What makes the restaurant is the service. The owner, John, was very friendly and just came up to talk to us. Our server, Divina, was also super sweet and spent some time to talk to us even though she was busy. The food came out quick and the fresh strawberry deep fried french toast was amazing! Prices were reasonable, I'd definitely recommend this place and we will be returning when we're back in Arizona again."}
{"text":"good food. I have loved this place for years.  Big plates but it os so good you cannot stop."}
{"text":"This place is amazing great staff and great food. Fresh orange juice to order and water at every table."}
{"text":"This is our second time here. A friend recommended and we are so excited to have a new, fantastic breakfast joint. The food is sooooo good. The ingredients are nice and fresh. What we love most is the customer service. We've had Davina (sp?) as a server twice, and she is phenomenal!  Very attentive, courteous,  and kind. Thank you. It is so nice to have real customer service that leaves a great impression."}
{"text":"They turn tables pretty quickly so the wait was not too long for a table on a Friday morning during spring break. I could imagine the weekends getting crazy though. Food was great and friendly service. We'd visit again."}
{"text":"We have been here for breakfast many times and the reason it is always crowded is because it NEVER DISAPPOINTS!! The specials are always delicious and the French toast is absolutely out of this world!  Highly recommended without hesitation!!"}
{"text":"Just tried this restaurant this morning for breakfast. Great food and outstanding service."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Deeeelish food!!! I recommend the Biscuits and Gravy with hash brown side and my Bride had the French toast."}
{"text":"Consistent great fresh food. Pancakes are amazing. The only reason for 4 and not 5 stars is the atmosphere.  They've added too many tables in too small an area which makes for an incredibly loud atmosphere because they're always busy."}
{"text":"the BEST place for breakfast or brunch in Phoenix! such good food and the service is great. family owned and they take pride in what they do. it can get a little busy so be prepared to wait on the weekends but its worth it!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food!

If you get a chance, Fridays during Lent they do a fish fry to benefit the Boys and Girls Club."}
{"text":"Good food. also had the sexiest server. not sure if she is asian or mexican. but love the fake eyelashes and tight shirt"}
{"text":"My wife and I had breakfast at about 1 pm during the week. No wait, fast and friendly service, delicious food. My wife who doesn't eat donuts, got a Cinnabon to go. It shocked me. What a great place to go for those of us who are breakfast people."}
{"text":"I base my feelings of breakfast places solely on their biscuits and gravy. I will be back.  Service was top notch."}
{"text":"Down for Spring training.
Newly opened. Clean, friendly staff, BIG portions. 
Good luck-  John, Nick and Dustin
SF Giants friendly:)"}
{"text":"I'm a breakfast fanatic. This was awesome. We will be back and try a locally made ice cream milkshake, cuz I hear it brings all the boys to the yard and they're like \"it's better than yours\"."}
{"text":"I had a short notice breakfast/brunch date with a couple of friends and my 1 y/o daughter this past Wednesday. Literally, the morning of, we settled on this place after a few yelp searches and boy am I glad we chose this place!

Even with the recent bad review about the crab omelet, I took a chance and ordered that with the hollandaise sauce - YUMMY! It was filled with lump crab, moist, tender, and delicious! 

Kid friendly atmosphere - which is great, I'm very picky about where I dine out with my daughter as to not disturb others but she had fun, lots of other kids around her, and people several booths away were waving hi and keeping her engaged and smiling away.

The reason for 4 stars: they could've used a few more servers and bussers to help with drink refills. 

I'm definitely planning on going back and planning on bringing my immediate/extended family with me - we all love a good place to grub and this one is on the list!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the crab omelet and the chicken fried chicken! Just discovered this neighborhood gem and will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good.  The service was great. I had the French toast. I will be returning with the family in the near future."}
{"text":"Omg the food was wayyyyyy better than we expected! Best breakfast I have EVER had. Our server was very attentive personable and friendly. This place is the bomb and we will be coming back for more real soon!"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday Morning.  Big Crowd.  The service was good. The Food was OK.  I have had better but it wasn't awful.  We weren't a big fan of the french toast - very tough to cut due to the style... but to each his own, everyone has different tastes."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time this morning. My group could not have been more satisfied! We had a large group on a busy morning and only had to wait 10 minutes. Everyone in the staff was courteous and accommodating. We will be frequenting this establishment from now on. I had a breakfast sandwich and it was enormous It was delicious. I can't believe I haven't tried it sooner. The owner was even going table to table to check on all of the service. I love this is a local establishment and not one of those big chains. My family will be back soon."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in N. Phoenix... EVERYTHING on the menu is fantastic, even the gluten free banana pancakes! Service is top notch too! My girlfriend and I have found our new Sat morning breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Lots of yummy stuff here, from the pancakes to the deep fried french toast to the omelettes.  Delish!  Kind of a diner atmosphere, good service."}
{"text":"Today I have the egg omelette with mushrooms spinach and goat cheese and the wife had the berry French toast and the service was excellent"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food, it was very good, by no means \"the best\", but no real complaints. It's a dollar or two higher than it should be, but because this place is busy, I understand the higher price, especially since they say they pay their staff well.

What I do not understand, or agree with, is the new cash only policy. Absolutely absurd!  After several years in business, they now say it's because it's too time consuming for them to accept credit cards, and that the cost is too high. I've owned several businesses, and I've never paid more than 2.9% to accept a credit card. If it's a real financial problem, raise your prices 2- 3% which is pennies and a non-issue, and don't play games with the customers who made this place popular in tje first place.  You say there's a free ATM out front, except it's not free. Since it's a private ATM, all major banks charge a several dollar fee to use that ATM.   Funny how virtually 100% of sit down restaurants take credit cards, yet you guys think it's too complicated, and doesn't work for you. You pass the buck, literally, and the nconvenience onto your previously loyal customers. 

Your new, silly, cash-only policy t's basically a money grab, where you're banking on your past strong reputation, and taking advantage of people, so you can pocket more cash.  That's shady. It's not right, and I suspect that in the longrun customers will not tolerate it and your greed will not pay off."}
{"text":"Generous helpings of good, diner-style food coupled with chipper service is what we get everytime we come here.

However, I've had attentive servers and servers deep in the weeds.  I've had meals that were excellent, such as the spam and eggs, and I've had some that were not so good, such as the fried bologna sandwich (my father-in-law also did not like it) and the spinach salad.  To clarify, there was nothing technically wrong with those entrée's preparations, they just didn't taste good to me.   

The coffee is always thin on flavor, but it is hot, fresh, readily offered, and kept coming.  The orange juice is fresh, but never cold enough to be refreshing.

Overall, there's nothing keeping me from Original Breakfast House, but there's also nothing compelling about it.  I've gone enough times to avoid the pitfalls (my better half loves this place), but there are pitfalls nevertheless. OBH is good enough to encourage you to go and make up your own mind.  There's a decent chance you'll love it."}
{"text":"We have been going here since it opened and I can't believe I haven't written a review!!!  We LOVE this place!  By now we've tried almost everything on the menu and have never been disappointed.  Delicious!!! The staff have always been amazing and many of then know us by name!!!  Weekends are busy and you might have to wait 20 minutes but every bite is worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"We tried this spot out for a late breakfast this morning.  We had about a 20 minute wait, but we didn't mind.  The hostesses were extremely friendly and chatty- a nice change from many places.  Once seated, I noticed that water glasses and a carafe of ice cold water had already been put on our table.  This was awesome, especially since we waited outside to be sat and it was on the warmer side today.  Our server was friendly, prompt, and efficient.  My husband ordered the egg white scramble and I had the french toast.  They were both really good.  The jam that came with my husband's toast was also delicious.  I also appreciated that the server brought us two flavors of cream for our coffee without hesitation when we asked- as she should have.  We have been places where they act like it is an inconvenience.  I can't help if we have different preferences!  Also- I noticed a couple of reviews complained about the temperature.  I was perfectly comfortable, so whatever they had it at today is good.  I normally FREEZE everywhere I go and my husband is always hot.  We both were comfy.  Seriously, I carry a sweater year-round for restaurants... Even when it is 120 out... And I was good.  We both felt that it was a good experience and a great price point.  We also like that they use local, fresh, organic when they can.  Fresh just always tastes better! :)"}
{"text":"Proof that you don't need fancy when the hospitality is genuine and the food is authentic. Place has wonderful energy - the entire Team is \"ON IT\"!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place!!!

Cute interior, great service (Try to get Kimberly). She was wonderful!! 

We will definitely be returning. One of our new favorite breakfast spots"}
{"text":"Service is exceptional.  We turned in our orders and before we could finish our first cup of coffee our food was served  Delicious.  Worth the drive from anywhere in the Phoenix Metro area."}
{"text":"In my continuing pursuit of amazing breakfasts, I came across Original Breakfast House with it's amazing Yelp reviews.  There was no way I could skip this place.  When I pulled up I was curious as the area did not seem very new or nice, however, there was a line out the door.  Approximately 20 people were standing outside waiting for a table.  We were told the wait would be about 20 minutes so we decided to stick with it and see what would happen.  

When we were seated there was already a carafe of water at the table.  Awesome!   Original Breakfast House makes their own fresh squeezed orange juice which seemed like a must try.  It tasted like I was literally licking an orange.  I've never had orange juice that fresh before.  Interestingly, it came with a refill as well.  Bonus!

I have been eating healthy lately so I opted for the egg white scramble (egg whites with mushrooms, onions, avocado, pico).  I didn't expect much...I mean it's egg whites and veggies.  This is the best egg white scramble I've ever had.  I don't think egg whites are supposed to be this good.  I was literally blown away.  

Our service was excellent too.  I asked for hot sauce and the server brought 5 kinds for me to choose from.  She was so friendly and even brought another carafe when our water ran empty.  

This was a wonderful breakfast spot and I would say it is definitely worth a visit if you are in the area or close by."}
{"text":"OMG, DELICIOUS!!!

As someone who LOVES breakfast, in the Phoenix area it can be hard to find.  I came across this place and there were awesome reviews, Yelp came through yet again.  This place is amazing!!  The decor is a retro modern, I loved it.  It is a cute place with great people and servers.  Very reasonably priced with big portions. Now let me tell you about the food:

First of all the cinnamon roll is to die for.  One of the best I have ever had!!  We also shared a cranberry orange scone, also very good.  Their sweets are all made in house and you can tell 100%.  They are a must when here!!

Now the food, also very very good!!  I had the pancake breakfast...it was 2 pancakes, eggs, and sausage or bacon for about $8.  This was very good.  The pancakes for fluffy and delicious.  My BFF had the french toast breakfast.  This was the same as the pancake but with 2 slices of french toast.  Their french toast is  awesome!!  It was like something you would find at a state fair.  It was like funnel cake french toast.  I would recommend this 100%.  My husband had the Hog Heaven omelet.  Oh my this was also delicious!!  There was so much meat and cheese in this thing it was unreal.  Also the potatoes were good!  

Okay, one more thing....the OJ!!  Fresh squeezed (you can see them do it).  You get a glass for $2.75 - with a refill!!!  It was a glass of fresh, pulpy deliciousness!!

Overall I would recommend this place to anyone, we will come back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast place! Food is delicious and not expensive at all. Great customer service! They don't take cards but they have an ATM available"}
{"text":"\"This place is a breakfast persons dream come true! Freshly squeezed OJ with the second glass at no charge.....eggs prepared perfectly, french toast to die for and fruit for the healthy. We have searched for a new breakfast place for over a year....we found a win...\""}
{"text":"I've traveled the U.S. and Europe... Two egg, two french toast like I've never seen or tasted. Yummy!! Kept me filled for 6 hours of hiking. I will drive out of my way to eat here again the next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I decided to check this place out because I was in the area and it had impressive reviews. My BF and I were quoted a 45-50 minute wait time. Fortunately for us and our hungry stomachs, we were sat after 30 minutes of waiting. Our server Divina was the sweetest. She was super attentive and helpful when we were deciding what to eat. I ended up going with the two slices of French toast with strawberries and whipped cream, and my BF went with the El Paso omelette. Both portions are massive and can be easily shared. Their french toast is so decadent. They deep fried them and they are made with sourdough. Super filling and sweet! The El Paso omelette comes with two sides as an option and we opted for the hash browns and toast. The toast comes with a homemade jam. They also have a freshly squeezed orange juice that is a must when you go. This place is awesome, but seems to always have a wait so plan ahead."}
{"text":"I was craving breakfast and decided to Yelp for a good restaurant,I found this place with good reviews and came to check it out. I got me a coffee,a chorizo and egg taco,and the French toast special. The taco was delicious,I like the French toast but I had better,the coffee was pretty good too.
It is a nice place,clean and really good service."}
{"text":"I tried Original Breakfast House for the first time just this week and I had the gluten free banana granola pancakes with a side of bacon and orange juice as well. They were great tasting Pancakes and the bacon was the best I've ever had at a restaurant! I have Celiac disease so I made sure to let the server know when they took my order. She said she would let them know that. I had no issues, they made sure to be careful about any cross contamination. When we were leaving, we found out that they also have gluten free buns and that if you order a sandwich or burger; they can switch it with a gluten free bun. It was a great atmosphere, kind employees and an awesome experience. I will be back to try their burgers and sandwiches!"}
{"text":"This is a nice down home breakfast place. The owners are a nice family who put a huge emphasis on customer service.
They have huge portions and yummy biscuits.
Which are hard for this Southerner to come by in Arizona. We especially like their omelets.
Crazy long lines on the weekends, but the line does move quickly and they usually can get you seated without much of a wait."}
{"text":"I just love this place so much! I first went to this restaurant about a year ago and I have been back many times. Definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"We came to Original Pancake House after Easter service. Staff is outstanding, friendly.
Their food, served with great smile is Great!#
Consistently wonderful \"GREAT FOOD\".
Great staff.  10 stars."}
{"text":"This has become our favorite breakfast place. We've become Sunday regulars. The  cinnamon rolls are not to be missed! Can't say enough of the delicious & plentiful portions. Haven't found one thing we haven't loved! The El Paso & Framers Market Omelets are two of our favorites. Great staff, everyone always has a smile on their face. See you next week!"}
{"text":"Very busy but they do a great job turning tables. My father is very particular about how his eggs are cooked, and they nailed it. Large portions of tasty food at a reasonable price. What could be better!"}
{"text":"The Real Test Took My Wife
Third time was not a charm, far from it.  I had eaten here twice before, the first time I had steak and eggs along with a great fresh orange juice,  Best I've had in years.  On my second visit I ordered chipped beef which was the worst thing I've had in a very long time,  Beef was runny and I think hamburger, potatoes were old and cold but the juice was still great,  So today I decided to take my wife who is a steak and eggs lover.  I had shared with her how great my experience was eating here and wanted her to give it a try, 

What a mistake!  THe steak was ordered medium rare and came out dry, old and cold as if it had been sitting on the grill for hours,  The hash browns on both our plates tasted of old oil. not quite rancid but close.  She could not believe that I thought this was good and had the nerve to bring her here,  Since this was the second time out of three experiences that were terrible, I assured her that this would be our last.  It is unfortunate since I had such great hope in the beginning.  

Note:  I had written two other reviews about The Original Breakfast House but do not see them.  One was very favorable and the other not so much.  Wonder where they went?

Frank"}
{"text":"Go here and eat theApple pancake it is wonderful and fluffy and delicious

This is an old-school joint that doesn't let you talk on the cell phone nor do they take credit cards

Yes you will smell like a diner when you leave but it is worth it!!"}
{"text":"Our first time here and this place is worth finding. A home style breakfast and lunch restaurant with excellent service and tasty, fresh food. We will come again."}
{"text":"This is the real deal breakfast joint.  We had the chicken fried steak and eggs and biscuits and gravy. Both were tasty. We also tried the blackberry jam served with the side biscuit which was excellent- not too sweet. We'll be back to try the pancakes and french toast."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place here in the valley. I like to go to local business owners. This place knows great breakfasts. Worth the wait for sure. Fresh squeezed oj and delicious coffee. Waitresses are super nice and the food is ammmmmazing!"}
{"text":"This place is excellent. Everything that I want a breakfast place to be. Its like \"The Place\", but with far superior food. Fast and extremely friendly and informative service, low prices, fresh local ingredients.

If this place was in Arcadia there would be hour long waits. Fresh squeezed navel orange juice. Awesome Coffee. Fresh local Bread. Local jam. Spot on Green chili. Perfectly crispy Hash. 

I like the El Paso. A very yummy omelet with chorizo and black beans and veggies. Get an order of green chili on the side and you will be a happy person. My wife is nuts over the french toast.

Its just a small, unassuming, little breakfast place that happens to do things VERY well. You won't find ultra hip music playing, or waitresses with super cute outfits.

Just go here wanting a good breakfast and you will leave getting exactly that. I think it is funny when people set their hopes too high for a breakfast place. I mean really, how good can an egg or hash browns be? In my opinion, this place tops the charts for the things that matter...

Do it right. Do it local. Do it cheap. Do it fast. Do it without an attitude.

If this sounds good to you, Go to OBH and enjoy."}
{"text":"OBH is a family favorite- we go often and have always had stellar service and the food is excellent and always prepared perfectly. Their coffee and iced tea and always fresh. The staff is kind and accommodates any requests we have."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good. But when asked about the cash only policy, they said it was because they pay their staff better than other restaurants do. OK, good for you.  When asked if that means we can tip less, we were told no, and to suggest that we were welcome to dine someplace else. I will do that."}
{"text":"Well I just found my new favorite breakfast joint in town! I was intrigued by all the raving yelp reviews so we decided to give it a try.  There was a 15 minute wait that seemed like the longest 15 minutes ever as we were starving. Once we sat down I knew I had to try the hot chocolate and my friend ordered the cinnamon roll. Both were yummy.

I went with the chicken fried chicken and French toast plate and it did not disappoint. In fact nothing we had here disappointed, from the food to the service to the prices. 

Tip- good chorizo tacos!"}
{"text":"My new go to breakfast place.  We liked the reviews and they weren't wrong.  The chicken fried chicken is AMAZING.   Also the orange juice is worth the squeeze. Well worth it.  Wish I would have gotten hash browns.   Looked yummy.  The wait was a bit long but worth it."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix and was looking for a local dig. This place feels like family. Love the owner walking around and greeting customers. French toast was incredible and eggs, which are usually flat at most restaurants, were tasty. Very friendly staff, reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Another great and solid meal at The Original Breakfast house.  Like I said I'm a big fan of breakfast joints in the valley.  I am open to try new and other places, but this place is so consistent and awesome.  They have outstanding customer service and very warming environment.  They do get pretty busy on the weekends, so expect a little wait.  It seems all good breakfast joints have some sort of wait.  My lady and I arrived at 8:00 on Sunday morning, and waited for about 15 minutes and was seated.  The service and food was all top notch.  We ordered the biscuits and gravy with two eggs and a side of hash browns, and the special which was a green chili tamale with eggs and others.  Both dishes were excellent and I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in a long time! Are you tired of ihop and Denny's than you need to try this gem.  I keep having the chicken fried steak. It is just amazing! So tender you can cut it with a fork! Service is great, fast and attentive. Get here before 9:30am or you will be waiting in line but it does move quickly. You will never eat at a chain breakfast place again!"}
{"text":"Tried this new place out. GREAT SERVICE. Sat right away. Children's menu was very affordable which is nice! I get tired of being charged $5 for something I can make at home for $1. 

Our waitress was great and attentive. I ordered the banana pecan pancakes and they were really really good. Great portions for the price. My husband ordered the pancake special and the yogurt parfait. Yogurt parfait was huge and delicious. 

I will be returning."}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day breakfast! It was awesome! Dezarae was great with suggestions and helped us make our decisions.

I got to try the chicken fried steak, gooey mess scramble, banana pecan French toast, and oatmeal for myself. It's no wonder this place has such great reviews! It all was delicious... Oh and don't let me forget about the fresh squeezed orange juice!

Great place for breakfast! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"I really really enjoyed this restaurant.  Clean, Quick, and Delicious. The \"big mess\" was great so are the cinnamon rolls! The service was also spot on.  We are quickly becoming regulars!"}
{"text":"Was the best breakfast we have had in Arizona. Gluten free and Celiac friendly. Our waitress, Sara was very knowledgeable and took the time to explain all options. She spoke with chef and owner to not cross contaminate our food. GF pancakes were delicious. All local sourced food items and delicious. As for the rest of the all you can eat gluten people, they had phenomenal looking and tasting food."}
{"text":"We tried this place because I saw it on Yelp! The ratings are accurate! This place has the best French toast I've ever had! The orange juice was freshly squeezed. Sooooo good!"}
{"text":"I'm an American girl who needs a hearty breakfast and lunch...or at least one of them:) it's always great when you find a place you can eat at, more than a couple times a week. This is a place that I want to go to...EVERYDAY!!!! 

The French toast is amazing! It's unique, it's crispy and it reminds me of a funnel cake! It's after my heart! Then we have the pancakes. I've always liked blueberry but have always been bored with plain. No problem here. I LOVED the chocolate chip and fresh raspberry pancakes!!!! Wow!!!! I even ate Oreo cookie pancakes! Also amazing!!!! Next I'm gonna order the banana pecan and I'm pretty sure that I will love those too! 

Then there is lunch. I don't like mortadella but the fried bologna sandwich...Heaven! And the BLT was seriously the best BLT I've ever had. I'm shocked I'm saying that only because I've had a million. BLT is my 1st choice, eat it almost everyday sandwich and this blew me away!!!!!! Dead serious! The bread looks thick, which it is, but it is light and delicate! I can taste it and by golly gee I want one now! 

And don't forget to order OJ! Fresh and sweet:)))))"}
{"text":"I've read a lot of great reviews about Original Breakfast House so my hubby and I went to check it out. Now, the service was great- our waitress was upbeat and explained the menu really well to us. Plus, fried French toast? Count us in! I had an omelette which was good but nothing to write home about. Potatoes were good, crispy and flavorful. The French Toast was very interesting. My one negative about it was the crust. Due to being fried, the crust on the French toast turned tough and chewy. Coffee is local and freshly brewed. Overall will return again :)"}
{"text":"When we first walked in, the place had a weird smell.  The breakfast is great...had the chocolate chip raspberry pancakes and they were just delish!  The kids enjoyed their food as well.  It is close to our house so I am sure we will be back!"}
{"text":"The French toast here is out of control amazing!!!!! It's so good I'm writing this review literally on our way home from eating here! The portion is huge! It tastes like funnel cake almost, it has the perfect crispness....sooooo good! Everything else we had--eggs,hashbrowns and the veggie omelette was amazing as well! I think we found a new breakfast spot! Whoo hoo!"}
{"text":"Close to giving this place 5 stars.... it needs more seating and the prices are just s little high. Otherwise some of the best lemony pancakes ever!"}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite breakfast spot. I have been going here for 3 years now and the food and service never disappoint. Must try the big ooey gooey mess and their monte Christos are delicious. 
I also want to give a shout out to their entire front of house staff from hostesses to waitresses to check out they are hands down the most friendly and warm staff ever!"}
{"text":"This place has a FANTASTIC breakfast! Make sure to get there early because they fill up quick! The wait is worth it, especially the fresh squeezed OJ.
The food is freshly prepared, the ingredients are fresh, & everything is good.  The portions are HUGE and you can easily share with someone else."}
{"text":"The wait was not too long.  Food came out fresh, fast and hot.  Plenty of coffee and ice water.  I'd come back again."}
{"text":"Ok first time here and they didn't disappoint! Chicken fried steak some of the best I've had and the cinnamon bun pancakes will leave your teeth tingling their sooo good. Believe the reviews, give this place a Try! We definitely have a new favroit place!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food.   Well worth the wait.  It's must stop when visiting Phoenix"}
{"text":"Anthem for cement I'm not a big breakfast person I think most taste the same but I was surprised they were different I would say their customer service is probably the best I've ever been to in a breakfast joint person walk in the door everyone smiling sit you down waters are a waiting for you at the table and pretty Pump Service wish that can answer any question you have seven pretty good assortment of food on their menu I opted for that eggs French toast and fruit eggs legs nothing special the French toast was awesome different than anywhere else I've ever had crispy flavorful you can actually taste the vanilla a great all-around my wife has a chilaquiles I tried them they were pretty damn good she thought they were some of the best she's had here in Phoenix the prices are not too bad I think the thing that people could play on most of is there no credit cards they have a free ATM which I don't see what the big deal is about if it keeps my prices low I'm all for it definitely be back in the future"}
{"text":"This was our first morning in Phoenix and we tried here for breakfast. We didn't wait very long on a Saturday morning and our waitress and server were very friendly and attentive. THE best breakfast we've had during travels in a long time. Everything was super fresh and in huge portions! Williams definitely want to come back to try some other stuff!"}
{"text":"Surprised by this great little find! Stopped in for a quick bite and found myself dreaming of California beaches and missing home. Had the steak and eggs, absolutely delicious! The deep fried French toast is sinful 
Do yourself a favor and stop in for a bite and enjoy. Yum!"}
{"text":"Oh my GOSH!!! Our first trip here and we will absolutely be back!
Ordered the Pancake Special (2 cakes, bacon & eggs), BF had the French Toast Special (2 toasts, sausage & eggs). Wowie zowie!!!
The pancakes have lemon in them and they are the fluffiest cakes I have ever eaten! The french toast is deep-fried, has orange & cinnamon in them and they are amazing! We both chose the real Vermont syrup for $1 extra, totally worth it.
Oh, and this won the BF over, they have whole milk. Yep. Yummy, syrupy french toast and pancakes and WHOLE MILK. 
The bacon is thick and cooked perfectly!! I didn't try the sausage but the BF said they were smokin' good!
Last but not least, our server Emily is a complete sweetheart and gave us the lowdown when we first got in. Thank you for making this a great experience!!!
We can't wait to come back next weekend for breakfast!!!"}
{"text":"I was in town visiting and happened to find this place on here. It had good ratings so I gave it a try. Service was good. Food was good. I will definitely eat here again if I'm back in town."}
{"text":"Everything is just so tasty. I'd do it every time I'm in Phoenix
The gluten free pancakes are excellent."}
{"text":"I can't talk highly enough of this breakfast house. My go-to always !! Food is homestyle and yummy ! I keep coming back ."}
{"text":"Wow, an enormous amount of food for a reasonable price.  I loved the pumpkin pecan pancakes.  My granddaughter loved her brioche cinnamon roll.  My daughter loved her creme brûlée French toast.  Her boyfriend tried the machaca scramble, and it was wonderful. My niece had the biscuits and gravy and it was huge!  Great value!"}
{"text":"The food is very good, moderately priced though not \"cheap\" and the portions are good. My Chicken fried steak and eggs ($11.50) were very good. The hash browns were \"ok\" but not as good as I would have expected. 
The place is often busy (a good sign) but it can affect service a bit, service for me was \"OK\" but not top notch...took awhile to get a water refill, took awhile to get the bill. 

I will go again...but not if I'm in a hurry...this is a sit and enjoy your food and take your time place...not a fast food joint."}
{"text":"This place is so good! This is definitely my new breakfast place. I would even consider moving to be closer to this place. I ordered the cinnamon bun and biscuits and gravy. Both were very good. Above all the service was in paralleled. Davina was a great server, very attentive and caring. The owner was there too and he was very warm and welcoming. I am definitely coming back until I wat very single thing on the menu."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Be prepared to wait everyone else seems to love this place as well.  Absolutely go for breakfast the food is amazing.  I went there for lunch would say they really shine at breakfast.  however in all fairness I've only been there for lunch one time.  The folks working there are extremely friendly"}
{"text":"Pretty good breakfast food. Service has always been great. The environment is in need of updating, but I'm not usually one to care much about that as long as the food and service are good."}
{"text":"This is an absolute must! The food is good and so is the service. A hidden gem. I have tried various items and liked all of them. Try the French toast or for lunch the clam chowder."}
{"text":"There's finally a place to have some good breakfast that isn't a chain in north Phoenix. 

I've been here a few times now and I'll admit that everything I've tried is really good.
But, if you really want to get your money's worth, come with a sweet tooth. Their pancakes and french toast are amazing.  When the menu says you get 2 slices of french toast, it doesn't mention that they cut the loaf of bread the long way and you're going to get a literal pound of delightful fried bread goodness.

Get some orange juice while you are at it. A lot of places claim to have fresh squeezed orange juice, but here you see the squeeze it and you can really taste the difference.

I urge everyone to come here, I'll risk a wait to make sure this place stays open!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast joint around. Fresh ingredients delightfully prepared and friendly service make this place a winner. I was here the weekend it opened and dozens of times since."}
{"text":"Our server, Rachel, was on the ball. Food was hot, delicious, and satisfying. I ordered the ham and cheddar omelette with extra crispy hashbrowns. I opted to upcharge the included pancakes to the pecan pumpkin pancakes. This was a good move. My whole meal was wonderful and the coffee was fresh. My husband ordered the Chilequilas (my spelling my be off) and was thoroughly satisfied as well. The portion size was large and he couldn't finish it even though he wanted to clean his plate. We both described this dish as \"breakfast nachos\" but with soft cheese instead of heavier cheddars. Worked really well for the dish."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now.  We were told about it from a friend and we are all about trying new places.  Ok, Food good - thank you for organic and fresh squeezed OJ.  

However, your staff lacks personality and they seem to be  \"deer in the head lights\". There is a difference between a Server and an Order taker. So, far both times we've had Order takers.  \"Hi, are you ready?\"  Opposed to:  Hello, how are you guys?  Have you been here before?  Let me tell you about our daily specials and let me recommend a few of my favorites. Nope, we got, are you ready? -- both times.  Going to the counter to pay, again no personality, lifeless humans standing there doing a job.  

Manager(s), you may want to wander around and do table checks. I can tell you want this place to do well, but, with your LIFELESS staff, it's going to be a stretch to be successful.  I mean --  jeez, even at Denny's we get some personality.  

There is no personality here -- zombies, taking orders and doing a \"job.\"  Just because your organic, doesn't mean you need have lifeless attitudes. 

Say hi, be fun, enjoy your customers, look people in the eye, check up on tables regularly, and when its time for your NEW Clients to pay their bills --  this is when you should be asking your NEW clientele, \"How was your experience?\" 

We will try your restaurant one more time, but if it's the same next time - No more repeat visits for us.  For those who know good service -- it won't take long for  people to spread the word.  So,  Are you amazing or below average?  You choose. 

Right now, Your below average. 

I hope you'll take this review and \"Step it up!\"  Its very fixable right now.  

See you next time......I pray you can \"step it up\" and bring some personality to your service staff. Right now, it's stale."}
{"text":"One of the best if not the best breakfast restaurants in town.  High quality food, great portions and a friendly staff.  Eat at the bar to avoid long waits.  Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"5 star meal for a 3 star price!
Excellent food! French toast is to die for, the granola is fantastic, and the fresh squeezed orange juice and the hot chocolate are both amazing. Had to wait a few minutes for a seat, but our waitress was super sweet and attentive. The portions are huge though! Wish I had shared with a family member, we had a ton of leftovers. If I lived here I would come here all the time. The atmosphere is cozy and comfortable, kind of a cross between a little diner and your local ihop. Love this place! Really is the best breakfast restaurant in the valley!"}
{"text":"pernaps i was expecting too much.  had the blackberry pancakes.  kindy pricey.  it wasn't bad but just didn't stand out.  the noise level was not average it was kind high and the tables are way too close together.  i might give them another try sometime but no hurry there."}
{"text":"Best in Maricopa County.
Fresh organic food, friendly staff,and a very cool owner.
For a great tip please reward yourself here."}
{"text":"Went here this morning for breakfast with a friend. I had the El Paso omelette and it is definitely one of the best omelettes I have tried in the last few years! My friend had the biscuits and gravy and she said they were really good. Service was excellent and so was the coffee. I will definitely be back here again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Incredible breakfast. I got the spam and eggs with an over-medium egg, a side of avocado and lots of tapatio on top. I love spicy food! It comes with a banana pecan pancake but I swapped it for the special pancake of the day: a strawberry cheesecake pancake. Can you blame me? It had fresh strawberries and cheesecake bites in the batter and on top with a hint of a cinnamon flavor as well. It was delicious! My dad got the linguisa with eggs and my brother got a pulled pork sandwich on crunchy sourdough bread with a fresh squeezed OJ. None of us could finish our plates but we left stuffed! They even gave me a cup of coffee to go!"}
{"text":"Well here goes nothing poppin my cherry for one star.. I started by wanting a to go order but they do not take calls, or not able to take calls from the front anymore. Since it's close to my house about a block I drove there after reading the reviews here and seeing the photos of the corn beef with egg and potatoes. I get down there and they don't have that though, it's a special that changed. They did have a creamed beef on toast so I got that and a side of ham steak. The ham steak was good but wow the cream beef was sooo over seasoned. It was so strong with garlic and spice it was making me sick and my gf couldn't even eat hers at all. I was highly disappointed from the reviews and the manager(young lady) was marketing me since she knew I came from yelp, which was odd. On a lighter note they had a charity bin and you could donate clothes which is good to know!!"}
{"text":"Great place if you're hungry. Plates are huge, good service, family restaurant. Brioche Cinnamon Roll is soft and good. I had the Gooey Mess Plate....yum. My wife and I split a plate and we still took food home. We live in Chandler, but so worth the drive. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Tried this place with a groupon, but will return to pay full price! 
The basic pancakes with a touch of lemon are wonderful!
I had the 5 egg white scramble, a bit customized. My request was accommodated happily and accurately. The hash browns were well done exactly the way I love them.
I forgot to ask for my son's burger to be served without mayo. They were wonderful about replacing it.
Highly recommend this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"It's simply the best.
Food is always consistent, always served quickly and always delicious!
We eat breakfast there every day while visiting Phoenix.
If you like fence toast, they have the best!"}
{"text":"Wow! Tried this place this morning and why haven't I been here before? It's literally around the corner from my house. I would be here daily for breakfast if I could. Very clean, beachy theme, exceptional service, and the food was outstanding. Had the cinnamon roll (HUGE with mounds of cream cheese frosting) and oh my I was in heaven. Now I have to try the caramel roll. Will be back to try EVERYTHING!!! Kudos to the staff!!!!!"}
{"text":"Can't wait to try their french toast topped with pecan. Me and my friend went on our Spring break from Chandler to Phoenix and had a chance to try this place out. We had to wait for almost 45 minutes to have our seat at 12:30pm afternoon. Yes we were starving and ordered too much food. All the foods were good as expected and I also love the orange juice here too (buy one get one free refill). Would come back to try other yummies!!!"}
{"text":"So glad we found this place! Everything was fresh, delicious and well presented. Service was attentive, knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly. Fresh OJ with a refil included was great and they even offered to let us take more coffee to go gratis. Gluten free options and excellent substitutions available to customize an already rocking menu. Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"On our way to the airport from Prescott we decided the highly reviewed breakfast house and she did not disappoint.
This place was packed as expected for a Sunday morning but they sat us down quick.
I was starving at this point and was looking for the biggest meal on the menu which was the breakfast scramble I believe. It's really hard to mess up breakfast but a lot harder to make breakfast really good. My meal was the bomb and my buddy got the French toast which was huge and luckily more than enough for him which meant more for me.
The service was great and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: Cash only! They have a free atm by the entrance for your convenience. 
On a holiday only had to wait 25 min to be seated. There was a crowd outside waiting to get in. The waitress was very attentive and food was phenomenal. Everyone in my party enjoyed their meal. 
I had the Popeye omelet which has spinach mushrooms and other tasty stuff.. with a side of crispy hash browns and lemon blueberry pancakes"}
{"text":"Was very bummed when I pulled up to this place this morning for breakfast.  We had decided we would come today because it was a random Tuesday and we wouldn't have the lines that are inevitable on the weekends.  (I've stood in them many times, the food is excellent!!) 

However, I was shocked to see a bright sign out in the front of the restaurant that said \"Sorry, NO CARDS, CASH ONLY\"

This is new!  And a terrible way to find out upon arrival.  I never have cash on me, and I think it's unreasonable to change to cash only in 2017.  I will not be back because of this; it's too inconvenient, even if the biscuits and gravy are delicious!!"}
{"text":"Wasn't in love with this place. I tried the breakfast burrito. It was good, and had a lot of flavor. My wife had a omelette and the cinnamon bun. The cinnamon bun was put in the microwave a little too long and was super dry."}
{"text":"I came here because of the high ratings on Yelp, but it was really a disappointment. 

I went on a weekend for brunch around 10:30 am and we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table for 2 people, not a bad wait considering how busy it was. 

We had to wait about 7 or 8 minutes before anyone came over to the table to take our drink order, so by that time, we had decided what we wanted to eat, and just ordered all at once. 

I got the Farmer's Market omelet, which came with hash browns and toast. I also got the freshly squeezed orange juice, which came with one free refill - this was probably the best part. 

The food came pretty quickly, and it wasn't that good, the cheese wasn't melted enough, all of the veggies kept falling out of the omelet. Also the glasses and silverware looked like they still had food on them. A lot of the servers looked like they have not taken a shower in days and the overall vibe of the place was more like a diner that you go to at 3 am than a family restaurant. 

I will not be returning, I think this place was really overrated."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast restaurants I have eaten in.  We were staying at a hotel about 20 min away but had to try this place based on the high yelp ratings it had. i am glad we did.  The orange juice is freshly squeezed right in plain view and you get free refills. Locally baked bread and jams are delicious. Love the take on trying to provide healthy products like organic milk and cage free eggs. I had the 5 egg white scramble and it was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"It's a small & busy place, expect to have a long wait time, especially on the weekends (20-30mins) from the pastry side I tried the cinnamon rolls which are  delicious , the server heat them up for us prior to serving I also tried their muffins, they are soft and taste is ok. As main dish we  had the french toast & scrambled eggs. French toast was fried to perfection, very good. Also tried the chicken fried chicken, very well cooked however it needed a little bit of salt. The kids pancakes aren't that special, they taste like the ones you buy frozen and reheat. Squeezed orange juice was very good. The cinnamon rolls pancakes I didn't like, not quite sure what it was but it wasn't what I was expecting. So if you are craving cinnamon rolls I would recommend going straight to the actual cinnamon rolls which are delicious, huge and a very fair price. 
Service was great, everyone was nice & friendly. Prices are a little on the higher end compared to other breakfast places around the area."}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix and looking at reviews my family and I decided to visit. My eggs were cooked perfectly, and the kids liked the pancakes. My wife decided to go with trying some of the baked goods and they were good. Service was good and treated the kids well. I would come back if I was in the area, just don't know if it is somewhere I would go that far out of my way for."}
{"text":"I love their chicken fried chicken! !  It's actual chicken breasts fried cfs style with their yummy homemade gravy on top. It's fantastic. And comes with 2 eggs & a huge piece of French toast. I don't like how they deep fry the French toast. It tastes like grease. Maybe they can cook it the griddle way if I ask? I'll try that next time. 
Service is always friendly & the food comes out quick even when the place is packed"}
{"text":"It's twenty minutes after 6:00am. Several cars wait expectantly in the lot beneath a waking Arizona sky. Plump clouds hover uncharacteristically low, nearly kissing the horizon. Behind them, the sun creeps vertically on its course.

It's 6:35am. Warm light cuts across a long, narrow bar. Casts exaggerated shadows. Dims for a moment. Regains its strength. The sky adjusts through lighter and lighter shades of blue outside the window opening eastward to the right.

You are alone except for the clinking sounds of silverware and glass, the padding of energetic feet on pinched carpet, the undulating hum of conversation. You are alone except for the notepad to your right, a pen, your keys, a glass of water.

Later, you will walk back to your car. The hours will embrace you, they will lead you into alternating plans. You will sit at another bar and place yourself again beneath the lilting rays of sun. You'll revisit yourself here and softly watch.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS.

I was one of several patrons to arrive at the Original Breakfast House prior to opening today. I was both surprised and impressed by this: it spoke volumes about the business before I ever stepped foot inside the door.

Upon entering, I was immediately greeted by Brittany. Brittany was very impressive to me because I know how challenging it can be to open the doors of a business to a throng of waiting customers.

Despite being busy right out-the-gate, Brittany was cheerful and accommodating. She gave me my choice of seating and made a point to check back in with me throughout the course of my (long) stay.

Later, I overheard her telling someone that she chose to come in to work today despite the fact that her family was visiting from out of town. She said this without a twinge of irritation or unkindness in her tone.

ABOUT THE SERVICE.

Once seated, I was handed over to Emily, who was equally cheerful despite the early hour. Watching her, I couldn't help but notice how relentlessly she smiled. Her whole essence was bright and kind and genuine - weightless even.

Emily was happy to help me choose my meal, assuring me that she's worked at OBH for a very long time and has tried just about everything on the menu. We settled on a Caprese Omelet from the specials menu with home fries and a side of wheat toast.

I also ordered a fresh-pressed orange juice and a coffee. Emily informed me that all their bread was supplied by the Arizona Bread Company. She told me that the orange juice included a free refill and even (later) offered to let me take it to-go.

The coffee was brewed fresh while I watched and poured in front of me, then the entire pot was left for me to finish at my leisure. A sign at the front-of-house told me that the coffee served here comes from Cortez, a local roaster out of Tempe.

LET'S TALK FOOD.

Honestly, everything was delicious. The omelet, featuring melted mozzarella, plump cuts of heirloom tomato, and huge, FRESH basil leaves with a touch of balsamic, was DELICIOUS: cooked through and flavorful without being overdone.

Even the home fries were a home run: easily the best home fries I've experienced in Arizona to-date. The wheat toast was thick-cut, toasty on the outside and soft on the inside. It was outstanding, too.

Emily also had me try the pepper sauce, which she noted as a specialty of theirs. It was EASILY the most flavorful hot sauce I've ever consumed. In hindsight, I should have asked to buy a bottle... Dang.

The orange juice was spectacular. I literally watched Brittany cut, prep, and press a fresh batch from real oranges. Pulpy and flavorful, I would drive all the way to OBH just for this - no lie.

CONCLUSION.

I decided to visit the Original Breakfast House based on the overwhelmingly positive feedback I found on Yelp. I was NOT disappointed. Despite being pretty far out of my way, I would visit OBH again. In fact, I look forward to it.

If you haven't been, I'd rate it one of the better breakfast stops in the valley and strongly encourage you to find an excuse to go. Next time I'll bring friends. **A very, very easy 5 stars.

A NOTE TO THE STAFF.

Emily and Brittany - thank you for taking such good care of me this morning. I'm used to being the only one with any pep in my step at that time of day, but there you were, right on pace. Both of you were wonderful. THANK you.

OBH owners - well done. I couldn't have been more pleased with my stay at your establishment this morning. I WILL be back, and I hope you get a few extra visits based on this review. You've earned it. CHEERS.  :)"}
{"text":"Finally decided to make the drive to try this place out. We waited 30 min on a Saturday morning, not bad because they have plenty of comfortable seating. We got their famous chicken fried chicken which comes with 2 eggs, toast, and a slice of their french toast. We also got the blueberry pancakes. We liked the banana pecan french toast, has that crispy \"San Francisco\" style exterior but not the pancakes because it has a lemon zest flavor. They were big and fluffy but not just our kind of pancakes. The fried chicken had good flavor, not overly breaded which I like but nothing amazing.

Service was great, they try to be as attentive as possible but expect a little delay because of the crowd. I would come back for my french toast cravings."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Nice friendly service.Delicious fresh squeezed Oj with free refill. Reasonably priced with large portions. The ham is off the bone real ham
Delicious baked goods
Will definitely return (probably  tomorrow )"}
{"text":"The Original Breakfast House is amazing. It is a very relaxed breakfast joint with delicious orange juice and great cinnamon buns. They have omelettes and   pancakes too. It feels as if it belongs in California, and it was founded there so, it fits pretty well.I say, in total, it is a five star restaurant all around."}
{"text":"I've eaten breakfast at all the big ones... Matt's, Over Easy, Good Egg, Scramble, etc. You won't find the artisan breakfast here, like asparagus and capers and salmon. You will find basic breakfast staples done very well at a great price point. Fresh squeezed orange juice which comes with a free refill, great French toast, large omelettes, and a small appetite menu. Decor is very clean and unpretentious. Service is very prompt and courteous. This is our new breakfast spot for a quick and good breakfast."}
{"text":"Would I come back? If you chose to come here, you made a good decision. The food is good and the service is awesome. My friends and I came on a Sunday morning and we knew we were going to wait because of its high reviews and the fact that it was a weekend. We checked in and were told that it would be a 45-1 hour wait. The line moves pretty quickly and we were seated in 30 mins. 

They have their original menu and specials. We decided on the chicken fried steak with French toast and tiramisu pancakes. We each got an orange juice too which came with 1 free refill. 

The chicken fried steak was pretty good. The chicken retained some juices and was not completely dry. They cut up the chicken into smaller pieces compared to other places where they give you a big slab of chicken. The French toast edges were a little hard but it just gave the toast more texture. 

When the tiramisu pancakes came, all I could think of was diabetes, seeing all the sauce on top. It was surprisingly a subtle sweetness and the sauce complimented the pancakes well. They were super fluffy as well. This was on their special menu so come and try it before they switch things up. 

Our server Emily and staff were super attentive. Food came out in a timely manner and we did not have to flag anyone down for anything. You can tell that the staff is working in unity. Would definitely recommend people who are first timers in Arizona to check this place out."}
{"text":"BEST BREAKFAST EVER! The chicken fried chicken is so delicious and filling. I would recommend going during the week- I have waited up to an hour for a table on the weekend! But that just tells you how fabulous this place is. Have also tried the big gooey mess. Get it without onions if you don't like an overload of big onion chunks!! The big cinnamon rolls are worth every penny as well. My family and I go here often. 5 stars! My only complaint would be to add more locations valley wide!"}
{"text":"The staff is incredibly nice, food is da bomb, and the overall atmosphere is great! Would recommend the chicken fried chicken special :)"}
{"text":"Amazing! I gorged on the blueberry pancakes and wanted more though I was over filled. All of the staff was attentive and cheerful. As a customer you instantly feel at home. Ever since leaving I've dreamt of going back. Make sure you get the fresh Orange juice."}
{"text":"Was hoping for so much more after reading the reviews.
Staff - great, they were all polite and smiles
The wait- 15 min as they said it would be
The food- lacking, both my wife and I were disappointed in the Popeyes omelette and the south west one. The onions inside were almost raw in both. Sometimes bigger is not always better. Biscuit and gravy read on the menu to sound fantastic but again just fell flat. 
Wish AZ had Norm's Restaurant then this place could try better food and imitate it. 
Decor- outdated and very random."}
{"text":"Came here the other day and got the parfait and it was wonderful and huge. Service and atmosphere were pleasant."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast. I ordered one of the daily specials and my husband ordered breakfast tacos. The staff is great. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I live right around the corner from this little gem. Simple and low key place with amazing food! The staff always remembers us and  is very friendly. The Juan's Tacos are absolutely delicious, however, if you're trying to stay healthy the banana crunch oatmeal is great too!"}
{"text":"When you first walk in you are greeted by friendly faces... And a pastry case. It's really hard not to just order one of each with a cup of coffee. I found this lovely gem while doing a search for breakfast on yelp. The pictures of the food is what brought us here. Wow. What a great find.

We came early for breakfast (before 8:30) on the Memorial weekend and good thing too because the seats outside were completely full of people waiting to get in when we left. It was our first time so we went balls out. I was quickly lured in by the french toast combo, but then the Chicken Fried Chicken caught my eye. My husband ordered the same thing. And to my luck, my daughter ordered the french toast combo so I got to taste her yummy thick cut bacon. My two boys had the pancakes with bacon. I also ordered a side of biscuits and gravy. Heck, why not!?

I don't think we talked much during the meal. It was mostly, \"Ummmm.... This is so good!\" Or, \"Here, try this, it's really good!\" My daughter's hot cocoa was a thing of beauty. It had whipped cream, chocolate syrup, and sprinkles! Too cute. 

We had great service from beginning to end. We asked the manager for syrup to go since we were staying in a hotel. He went a step further and offered us utensils. Yeah, kinda forgot about that part, but he had us covered. The prices were reasonable for our meals averaging about $12 a plate for a big breakfast. 

This place is bookmarked and will be on our to do list every year we go back to AZ. Thanks a bunch! You were awesome!"}
{"text":"This is a great local breakfast spot! We found it along with a couple other 4.5  rated breakfast spots. I chose this one over the others from its reviews. The folks were very service oriented and made our 30 minute wait on Sunday well worth it! The cinnamon bun is very delist. The fresh squeezed OJ was as good as any I've had in Florida. The Mexican breakfast dishes were well prepared and delivered with generous portions. I love good local spots! This is one!"}
{"text":"Just had breakfast here and everything was perfect!!!  The Popeye omelet tasted great, the pancakes were delicious, and the fruit was fresh. And the coffee was excellent.  Wonderful, friendly service from being greated at the door to the waitress (forgive me that I forgot her name but she has such a warm smile and presence) to the young lady that brought out the food.  I was feeling a little sad this morning but this experience shifted my energy and made me feel much better. You never know how the simplest things can have a positive impact on a person. I had to write this before I left the parking to show my appreciation - so thank you  if anyone from the restaurant reads this."}
{"text":"I'm gonna start with WOW! I currently own a small restaurant myself (BackBurner Family Restaurant Prescott Valley Az), now that doesn't make me a expert but I want to give my opinion. I found OBH on yelp. We were confidant it was gonna be good when we had to wait (10 minutes) on a Thursday morning at 9:30 to be seated. Divina was our server and she is outstanding! She made great recommendations and our experience was amazing. I would highly recommend this restaurant. All of our meals were great. Oh and the prices are reasonable. If you're in the area or close by make sure you stop in. Thanks Divina."}
{"text":"Nice little breakfast place.  Friendly service and atmosphere.  Not much of a wait and homey decor.  I got the banana and pecan French toast with eggs and bacon.  They deep fried the French toast which I have never experienced before.  It was delicious.  It's going to be hard reverting back to the way we have French toast at home.  Overall it was great and very filling."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My friends and I are vacationing in AZ and came across this spot leaving the airport. What a treat! I ordered the chicken fried chicken and it was very tasty. The food was fresh, hot and seasoned very well. The cafe au lait was also ordered. The coffee obviously wasn't as good as a New Orleans Cafe Dumonde au lait, yet it was still good. The customer service was fabulous and the scenery was well lit and inviting. I definitely recommend this restaurant. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The people make this place what it is. I'm from CT so I don't know if I'll be back in the area again, but if I am, I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Went there Saturday morning with one of my college age nieces while her car was getting worked on.  One word, AMAZING.
I'm not an adventurous eater at all so I stuck with the basics.  Scrambled eggs with melted cheese on top, bacon, hashbrowns and whole wheat toast and of course black coffee.  I have to say, the bacon was about as perfect as bacon can be.  I mean, bacon, it makes everything better right?  But this stuff was amazing.  Crisp, but not burnt, not at all soggy or undercooked, not all shriveled up like some of the cheaper cuts of bacon.  This stuff was PERFECT and oh so tasty.  Needless to say, the bacon was gone before I even considered the rest of the plate.  The eggs were excellent as were the hashbrowns and the nice thick toast.

Now onto the service. We pulled into the parking lot, the place was packed.  We checked in and they said about 15 minutes.  Well, they were spot on.  Inside of 15 minutes we had a table.  Our waitress, I'm sorry but I can't recall her name, was very friendly and helpful.  She wasn't overbearing by coming back to check on us too often but she was right there when my coffee needed a top off.  We had a nice quick chat about how bacon is the perfect food and how the we like our coffee the same, strong with no junk added.  Food was out quick and like I mentioned, damn good.

My only regret, was not getting the pancakes after seeing the ones my niece had ordered.  Dang, those looked good!  Next time, the pancakes will be mine.

The only \"negative\" point in my view is they recently switched to cash only.  They do post a nice explanation on why they are cash only and as someone who has previously worked in retail business, it makes sense.  They do provide a free ATM inside the restaurant so that does help.

I can't ding them on the cash only part, it's their way of paying the employees more and they sure all seemed to be in good spirits when we were there.  All hustling about and everyone I saw was smiling.  Well worth what some people might consider the hassle of paying in cash."}
{"text":"Better than McDonalds breakfast. I'm not a local but I've had better.  Eggs were overcooked but the toast wad terrific. Staff was very good, and polite. Food was good but not great. Expect a 3 not a 4+."}
{"text":"Great coffee. Locally roasted beans.  Sour dough French toast.  Great has browns. Five egg white scramble is delicious."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The staff are friendly and nice. The food is super filling! We came in with a group of 9 and they sat us quickly. Service was excellent. We had everything from pancakes to eggs to French toast. Everyone loved their meal!"}
{"text":"Was excited to give this place a try.  So many breakfast places out there that are sub-par, I wanted this place to be awesome.

Well it was not!

The wait is normal 15 minutes. We sat down to a dirty table, they cleaned it.  

Biscuits and gravy was cold and stale. Told the server and she acted like I was crazy. No apology. Manager did come over but then my guests had finished their meal. He wanted to replace it and I said no thank you we had to go.  I did not eat. He still brought over a small plate of Biscuits and gravy. Nice and hot.  Was good. 

Why a kitchen person or manager can not get this right the first time beats me.  

I did not ask for it to be taken off the bill and it was not. 

Customer Service - bad.

Could give a 2 start but it worth you trying.  I just wont be back."}
{"text":"Fast service with very friendly staff. 
Loved the mom and pop feel!

Pancakes were amazing. Had the pumpkin pecan-this is a must. Also ordered the raspberry chocolate very fluffy and delicious. And the banana pecan French toast was like eating an elephant ear its DEEP FRIED. wasn't my favorite because I'm not of fan of deep fried. Others at the table order the chorizo taco with awesome potatoes and chicken sausage scramble.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is our very favorite breakfast/lunch place.  Fresh squeezed OJ that comes with a free refill.  Fresh sourdough bread.  Local, fresh ingredients.  Consistent quality.  Daily specials that are refreshingly creative or simply comforting old favorites.  Spectacular shakes.  The El Paso Omelette, Juan's Tacos, The Green Chili Cheeseburger, The Home Fries, The Mediterranean Rice Bowl are all absolutely spectacular!:)"}
{"text":"The French toast is deep fried and epic!  Eggs were slightly runny but completely offset by the fantastic hash browns and sausage links.  Others in my party had pancakes that were delicious and the OJ seemed to actually be fresh squeezed. 

Basically if you're looking for a traditional breakfast place, and not a healthy low fat place, this is what you're looking for.  I will definitely going back soon!"}
{"text":"OBH is easily a five star in my books. As you can tell I have been to many places for breakfast and this place rocks. The most important is the great food. We had the Hogs and Popeye omelette, both were amazing. The biscuit was the best, so fresh and melting in my mouth. I love my coffee and their coffee is really flavorful. Portions are generous, prices are of great value. Service was great as well. Can't wait to go back and try other items on their menu. 

Their lineups is a testament to their ethos, and a sure sign they are doing something special. Enjoy it as these kind of restaurants are not easy to find. You are so lucky to have one in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"First time eating at OBH. CASH ONLY, ATM on site. Food was good and solid tasting coffee. Our server was awesome, she had great suggestions and super vigilant of low coffee and water levels. I went the safe route, ordered 2 eggs with bacon and biscuits. My plate was delicious. I was jealous of my sisters dish the pork green Chile omelette. The pancakes were awesome."}
{"text":"Went here the Saturday before the Superbowl and it was packed! They managed to sit us in under 15 minutes, amazing. I have to say that the coffee is excellent, which is astounding enough to find in Phoenix. I had a short stack of blueberry pancakes which were light and fluffy with a generous amount of berries, well worth the price. My other half had the two egg breakfast with the dollar pancakes. Everything was done well and after tasting the plain pancakes, I think I preferred them!
And the service was wonderful! Quick, attentive and courteous. 
I'm sure we will be back. Highly recommended for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"We came on Sunday morning at 8.  About 30 min wait to be seated, which was expected.

We were greeted, seated, and our sever came shortly after.  The server and service (from other employees asking how we were doing and if everything tasted fine) was impeccable!!!!  

We ordered our food - Kids Pancake with Bacon, Chicken Apple Scramble with pancakes and home fries, French Toast, and a Cinnamon Roll!  (We always share our plates, so I got to taste all but the bacon.  But it was a nice thick slice!)  All of the food was DELICIOUS!  The portions were generous and the price was reasonable!

I would have given 5 stars.... if I hadn't killed a cockroach in the bathroom.  If this place wasn't so talked up, rated well, and recently featured as the best place in AZ, we would have left & never came back.  Of course I let someone know about the roach & hopefully it's handled."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. The sausage is the worst I have ever eaten. Bland. Only ate two bites. Does not deserve to be called sausage. Not sure if it was even made out of meat. Toast is whole wheat or sourdough only. Good ol' white toast is not an option. My son did not like the kid's pancakes. They were also very small. Coffee was weak. This is a hangout for newage health food types, not a restaurant for \"foodies\" like ourselves."}
{"text":"I have delayed writing this review for a short time now. I usually do not like to give less than a three star rating to a place on a review. And this review is not for a lack of try on their part. 

The place is always busy on the weekends so I decided to give it a try. I like a good breakfast place. So busy should be a good sign right? A wait of 15 minutes or so is common so be prepared. I do have to say that the wait staff (no pun intended) was fantastic. Very friendly and attentive. Just very busy and that is understandable. 

The coffee was hot and our server kept our cups filled the best she could, but you don't just go for a cup of coffee right? The \"fresh squeezed\" orange juice was good. Not to pulpy. This is where my experience went downhill. I ordered just a ham and cheese omelet after letting the server know of my mushroom allergy. She even wrote it on the ticket to make sure the cook knew. Well to my surprise I had mushrooms in my omelet. I asked to speak to a manager to get it straightened out but they never came over to our table. 25 minutes and no manager. Too busy I guess. No, I did not get the order redone and I did not order another dish. I was too afraid of cross contamination. I ate my toast, paid my bill for the omelet I didn't/couldn't eat and left. 

Sorry Original Breakfast House, first impressions are lasting. I'd love to try the place again but definitely not on a weekend morning. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt because it was packed but to serve an ingredient in a dish that the patron is allergic to is uncalled for from a kitchen staff."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast place!!

Don't let the wait scare you, it's definitely worth it. Get a cup of iced coffee and take a seat in the huge outside waiting area...the wait goes by quick.

This is the only place in Phoenix that I have found creamed chipped beef. Yes...I am a HUGE fan of the SOS...unfortunately the beef is more of a beef salami (?) but it's still delicious nonetheless. And the toast that it's on...oh em gee!! Thick sliced sourdough. I'm in love. My favorite thing about this dish? No eggs (I am the only person I know who doesn't like eggs!!) but if that's what you prefer, you can get a side.

Now let's move on to the french toast. I like mine with strawberries and whipped cream, which they definitely serve. The best part? It's deep fried!! I think this is my new favorite. I am more a sweet breakfast person than a savory and this hits the spot.

I wake up craving breakfast from here. The staff is friendly, the menu is pretty extensive, the coffee is great (local!), and they have a delicious looking pastry case, even though I have yet to try something from it. Maybe the next trip.

Be prepared with cash, no cards accepted. If you don't have cash on hand, there are a couple free ATMs inside. The one by the door gets a little crowded so use the one by the bathroom.

Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, the wait is well worth it!!!  I ordered the triple berry french toast with whip cream and let's just say WOW!!  In our group there was an order of gravy and  biscuits also a kids pancakes and bacon, my two girls are hard to please but they cleaned their plates with no issues at all!!"}
{"text":"Best place in Phoenix for breakfast the coffee was great and Chile relleno was delicious"}
{"text":"Wanted to try a good breakfast joint in Phoenix, and this did not disappoint. 30 min wait on a Sunday morning tells you the locals love it. I got the Chilaquiles and they were the best I've ever had. Huge serving, had leftovers."}
{"text":"Hippy vibe, HUGE portions! Had the short stack (enough for 2people) pancakes have a hint of lemon which is incredibly good. Hubby had the El Paso - I can't believe he ate it all!! Super cute & attentive waitress - (braids & tye dye Tshirt) will be coming back & bringing friends."}
{"text":"VERY impressive. They've only been open a month but everything runs smoothly. It's a family owned restaurant and Dustin, one of the sons, was very friendly and a great server. Nothing like being waited on by an owner. 

They have fresh squeezed orange juice (a must in my opinion) organic (!) for $2.95, and it comes with a free refill! We got the Popeye Omelette, which had spinach, mushrooms, and bacon, and was very tasty. The potatoes that came with it tasted like they had been soaked in water a little too long. We also ordered the pancakes and paid the $1 extra for a good sized portion of real Vermont maple syrup, which was totally worth it. The pancakes were delicious, light and fluffy, with a hint of lemon. Next time I'm going to try the raspberry chocolate chip pancakes. 

I love the building, it's very bright and cheery. The ambiance and decorations are great and the bathroom is very nice too. Overall, I'm extremely satisfied and I can't wait to take friends and family back here! 

The bill came out to about $20, which is more than reasonable for the fantastic food and great service. They put an emphasis on cafe free eggs, organic milk, locally sourced breads and jams, and fair trade coffee. My kind of place! My search for breakfast places is over, and I'll be coming back here weekly! :-)"}
{"text":"First time here and I'm an instant fan. Great food, great healthy options and great service. Definitely will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place due to the high ratings by other yelp recommendations but was let down and underwhelmed by the food and service. The wait time we were quoted was more than doubled and the food was sub-par. I'd suggest trying your luck at another local restaurant."}
{"text":"I discovered this place because my church shares the same parking lot.  Yelpers here got it right: fresh and yummy food, great service, and an owner who really cares - not just about his customers, but about the neighborhood. As mentioned already, along with decent prices there is a wait on weekends, but folks are waiting for a reason. GREAT PLACE to show your support for small, independent restaurants that need local support to survive and flourish; they have earned our business. Oh... and while I've loved everything I've eaten, I especially like their sausage and pancakes, although I'm going to have to try out the deep fried french toast and spinach omelet others here have reviewed LOL"}
{"text":"They have water waiting on the table which is amazing. The food was good and the atmosphere was very nice. It would be five stars if they would take down the picture that says they give free refills on orange juice. That is actually one of the main reasons we chose this place. The price is incorrect and they don't give free refills. It's fresh squeezed which I'm assuming some or most people prefer. I'm not a pulp guy. 

The business owner reached out to explain. Shows an excellent level of care."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast stop. My wife had the French Toast and thought it was the best French toast that she has ever had. The sausage was delicious and the cinnamon rolls are really good. The one knock against the cinnamon rolls is they use a cream cheese based frosting of which is not my favorite but otherwise very good overall. The other nice perk is they have fresh squeezed oj and one free refill."}
{"text":"Wow!  The Google search review said it was one of the 10 BEST Breakfast & Brunch in Phoenix.  This was TRUE!  In fact, I felt Buddy the Elf would have Congratulated them on being the BEST.  From the friendly greeter to the sweet and attentive server to the perfectly runny Eggs Benedict, this was a delightful and relaxing experience!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  

NOTE: CASH ONLY--but there is a FREE ATM on site.  Loved the explanation for this on the menu."}
{"text":"Jimmy Buffet atmosphere? You must be smoking. LOL. I'm a fan and there is NOTHING Jimmy Buffet going on here."}
{"text":"We love this place for breakfast.  Sometimes there can be a bit of a wait, but it's worth it.  Good food and excellent service.  We went today for breakfast with a large party and they were very accommodating!"}
{"text":"Had been wanting to try this spot for awhile and it did not disappoint. The service was efficient and friendly (but not overly, which would have annoyed me), and the food... What can I say? I had the corned beef hash special and it was some if he best I've had throughout the country. My wife's omelette was overflowing with delicious chorizo and was just awesome too. We will return for sure."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Out 11 year old said the pancakes were the best he'd ever had. Husband loved his hash. My pork chops and eggs were delicious. Fresh squeezed oj with free refill a real treat.  Even saw the guy squeezing the oranges so that tells you how fresh it was."}
{"text":"Good service, EXCELLENT food, good sized portions and friendly wait staff.

The food here is top notch. Glad to see such a great place in N. Phoenix."}
{"text":"One of our favorite go to places for breakfast in North Phoenix. I was a little bummed when they decided to become cash only. In this day and age, it's weird not to take credit card and their reasoning seemed a little weak. But if I had to judge them on quality of food and service, 5 stars all around. If you're in the area, looking for a reasonably priced breakfast with fast, friendly service, then check out OBH."}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast. Owner was there, making the rounds, early on a Sunday morning. He was seating people and clearing tables as needed. Hostess (who may have also been family) was full of personality, too. Nice people. Restaurant was clean, modern, nice decor. Good coffee, flavored creamers, they left the coffee pitcher in the table, which is great. Water pitcher on the table, too. Great service. Waitresses actually seemed to enjoy working there, and I assume that a good portion of the reason for that was the leadership and management. Food was excellent too. I had the juevos rancheros and my husband had the chorizo burrito. When I couldn't decide on my side item, and chose beans, the waitress pointed out that there were beans in the juevos, so I switched to potatoes. That really showed she cared and was thinking. I appreciated that. The potatoes were excellent. Husband loved the burrito. I found this place online last night, listed as one of the best breakfast places in Phoenix, and I can see why. I don't think it even took 5 mins to get our food. We drove almost 45 mins from Gilbert to come here, and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast place we found after a soccer match up north.  Went on Sunday morning.  15 minute wait and it was packed inside.  I had the chicken tamale green chile breakfast plate (special of the day) . I really enjoyed my meal.  Very flavorful.  My wife had something called the big messy breakfast scramble.  Eggs, bacon, mushrooms, onions, and potatoes all scrambled up with a side of toast.  Her serving was HUGE! I took a few bites and really liked it.  She couldn't finish the meal.  The good news is that will be my breakfast the next day :) . My one son had the pancakes breakfast.  2 big pancakes with 2 eggs.  I tried his pancakes and they were really good.  The pancakes had lemon zest added which I have never had before but they were very tasty.  My son could barely finish the meal since it was a lot of food.  My other son had the kids chicken nuggets.  The nuggets were very good.  They were homemade chicken nuggets.  I tried those also and they were definitely yummy.  The staff was very friendly.  Return factor is 100%  Only negative would be that it was a bit hot inside.  Either the air conditioning wasn't working properly or they had the temperature set too high."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in phoenix. The first time I went there, I asked the waitress how the chicken fried chicken was. She said if I got it, I'd love it so much that I'd never be able to order anything else off the menu and she was right. Get the chicken fried chicken."}
{"text":"I love the local flare of this place. The iced coffee is great, and my wife loves the gluten free pancake. Service is excellent. And the sweet roll... OMG.  It's a great place for breakfast."}
{"text":"I have no idea about what the rest of the food is like there but I can say I had no problem when my fresh baked cinnamon roll arrived to the table with WAY more oozy, creamy, delicious frosting than pastry. 

My breakfast companion and I discovered the frosting also makes a delicious alternative to maple syrup on their gigantic pancakes and waffles. 

Our waitress and hostess was awesome! Great friendly service. 

I can definitely see why this place is so highly rated. I'll be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!  Small, diner atmosphere.   The staff members were friendly.  I had the chicken and french toast.  The chicken was so good! 2 large breasts covered with gravy.  The french toast had a huge dollop of butter and was so fluffy.   I subbed the eggs for hashbrowns and they were very good.  The gold star goes to the fresh squeezed orange juice.   I'm sure it's the best juice I've ever had.   It tastes unlike any other orange juice I've ever had.  It's so fresh and sweet.   You even get one free refill!  I ate every bite and enjoyed it thoroughly.   They don't take credit or debit, but they have a no fee atm right as you walk in the door.  Great place!!!"}
{"text":"OBH knows how to do breakfast right! Great service, great food, at a good price. We've been there for Sunday breakfast two weeks in a row and not a single disappointment. The french toast is SO good! I love that it feels like a little \"greasy spoon\" type diner, but they servie cage-free eggs and locally sourced ingredients. We'll definitely keep this place on our list of regular spots."}
{"text":"We found ourselves far from home, in an unfamiliar part of town, and hungry for breakfast.  Yelp recommended this place.  Good call, Yelp!  Fast, friendly service.  Good menu variety.  In-house bakery.  Cage-free eggs.  Gluten-free choices.  And fresh-squeezed OJ...with a free refill!!  Give OBH a try!"}
{"text":"We stopped because of the yelp reviews and thankful we did. The food was delicious and the staff made great suggestions. Heads up; it's cash only and totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Another trip to AZ another trip to OBH. We had been told 15 mins it was more like 5. Great coffee and fresh OJ. Eggs Benedict but with Prosciutto. Tons of flavor. Great attentive staff. Another reason to come back."}
{"text":"Great casual breakfast place. Nice people and creative menu. The owner was personally inspecting everything going on (which you don't see very often).  My wife had a great omelette.  I had a bite, but can't recall which one it was. Ironically, we ordered a different omelette but the one someone (not our waitress) brought out was so good we ate it and didn't notice that it was different until we were finished. That doesn't happen every day!  Our waitress noticed and agreed we had ordered something with green chile. We insisted that they not make something out of the incident. 

I ordered the chicken fried chicken and gravy with two eggs and French toast. Very good!  They say it is their best selling breakfast. I believe it.  

Overall, I liked everything about it. Food, vibes, and service were all first rate. NOT fancy but cool, very cool."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast food around noon on a Saturday. From looking at the building from the outside, I was worried due to the restraunt looking old and run down. Once inside, I noticed that the interior had a \"local diner\" atmosphere, kind of like a Mom and Pop restraunt. After being seated at our tiny table with no wait, we ordered the Chicken Fried Chicken and Biscuits 'n Gravy. The food was out to our table within 15 minutes and the portions were generous. After sitting down and beginning to eat, I was very put off by how hot it was inside the restraunt. It was only roughly 85° outside, yet it felt even hotter and more humid inside. I even had to ask the waitress for more napkins so that I could dab my forehead. The food was good, but the amenities need an upgrade. Central Air and larger 2 person tables would make a great improvement. I would recommend, but maybe earlier in the morning so that it is not so hot inside."}
{"text":"Good food and great service earn this spot 5 stars in my book. Had the French Toast with blackberries with two eggs and thick bacon. Cooked perfectly and filled me up.  Will come back when in the area."}
{"text":"This place was busy but we were seated within 20 mins. The food was amazing and came out very fast. Our waitress was great, I believe her name was Emily. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of  best breakfast places I have had in a long time. Service staff really well trained and it showed. I had the chicken fried steak and eggs and it was amazing. Will definitly be coming back. Thanks to the owner John for having such a great place to eat will be back."}
{"text":"The freshly squeezed OJ is killer, friendly service, and food was awesome! I drive by here all the time and didn't notice it, my new favorite breakfast place in town!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp we found this place.  It was a Saturday and we had to wait for around 20 minutes.  When we saw the menu and tasted the food we understood its popularity.  If we didn't live in Tucson we would probably be there weekly."}
{"text":"I came here wanting to support a local business and something that was not Dennys. I got the biscuits and sausage gravy. Came out cold but it was very tasty. Also got the Denver omelette with the hashbrowns and whole-wheat toast. The toast was amazing fresh and thick, Denver was pretty good and Hashbrowns were really good but could've been cooked more they weren't very crispy on top. Coffee was so good I almost drank the whole mini picher they gave me. All around the atmosphere is awesome and the people are so nice, I will DEF come back here for sure. Please support local and not chains. Oh and they play Elvis Pressley songs."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot in the valley, we moved further from it a few years ago but still drive over whenever we can. The specials are amazing, I love finding out and trying new and exciting options when we arrive. The standard breakfast food is incredible should a special not appeal to you. A hidden gem worth the wait."}
{"text":"Where to start!?  This place is hands down our new favorite breakfast spot!  Which is a little unfortunate since we live in Gilbert, but it's worth the trip!  We got the juevos rancheros, the gooey mess, a side of pancakes and the cinnamon roll and just sort of split it all, seriously everything was amazing!  Excellent food, excellent service.  Amazing sense of team work the staff has!  The hostesses, servers, kitchen staff, and manager were all on the ball, we probably got asked how everything was four different times!  Genuine people, amazing food.  They know what they're doing!"}
{"text":"Ive been here before with my girlfriend and being here is always refreshing and they have great variety of breakfast food."}
{"text":"After a five mile hike I was starving. 

Breakfast and carbs sounded perfect. I headed over to OBH. I was greeted and seated. 

The orange juice was yummie and worth 3.45. The eggs are perfect and runny. 

This place is a great breakfast stop. Just get here early."}
{"text":"I visited the original Breakfast House recently, and found that this place is very popular with the local neighborhood. I arrived on a Saturday morning at about 8:15 a.m. and by the time I left at 9:15 the entire outer waiting area was full. This does tell you that the locals consider it a top breakfast joint. The food was good the service quick the coffee was tasty however I didn't think it was phenomenal. It was just a very good solid breakfast joint. Enjoy."}
{"text":"It's difficult to eat healthy while dining out, but this place makes it easy. The food comes from local sources, and they'll squeeze the orange juice at the counter when you order it.  I've had nearly all of the plates they offer and everything has been excellent. Certain times of year they also open for dinner and have a fish fry that is amazing. Being from Wisconsin I have a hard time finding a really good fish fry here. They even had walleye. My only suggestion is to not go during the really busy times or you'll wait forever. Saturday and Sunday mornings it can get crazy, but you'll know the second you pull up because most of the waiting area is outside."}
{"text":"Good breakfast. French toast is great"}
{"text":"We eat here often and it's always great. They have fresh OJ and many choices for every one to choose from.  It's clean and bright and the staff is always happy."}
{"text":"Biscuits and gravy were super yummy!!! Coffee was not super strong.  Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! This has become my family's new Sunday morning tradition. Green chile omelette is amazing."}
{"text":"All cash but fee free ATM. EXCELLENT SERVICE, clean, interesting menu items in addition to classics. Local ingredients, fair trade coffee. Local crowd. We came on vacation and chose based on ratings - didn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"This place hits home!  Pancakes are the best ...my daughter has even eaten 2 kids pancake plates by herself, and she is 5!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my FAVORITE local breakfast place. Great atmosphere, FRESH food, sense of community, cannot day enough good things about this place!!!"}
{"text":"I was traveling from New Jersey and tried Original Breakfast House and I was great! great food and great friendly service! The banana pecan French toast was delicious!"}
{"text":"I had the French toast which was solid but a tad bit dry.  Coffee was average but I work for Starbucks so I'm a bit opinionated.  Bacon was delicious.  Brought home a cinnamon roll which was very good."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing. One of the best breakfast spots I've ever been to. The omelets are extraordinary and the biscuits and gravy are some of the best I've ever had. The gravy is the good kind with big chunks or sausage in it. The home fries are a must have. Only two knocks on this place is that I'm not a huge fan of their pancakes as they have a lemon flavor to them that some people like but it's not for me. Also, their prices are a bit high for breakfast food. After tax and tip I paid $17 for my food. If you haven't been to this spot yet I highly suggest checking it out. I haven't been there yet for lunch but will soon!"}
{"text":"I'm the kinda guy that loves breakfast.  And since I don't go to breakfast very often, when I do and when I pay a pretty decent amount I want something to \"WOW\" me.

The OBH is okay, they have very friendly staff and good service.  Everything that is normal in a breakfast place.

Now when it comes to the menu I had the Popeye omelette which had spinach, mushrooms, bacon and onions.  Not bad, it was good, but it was also $10.75 for something that was basically \"okay\".

My significant other had the Big Gooey Scrambled Mess.  Eggs with potatoes, sausage, mushrooms and onions with a boat load of cheddar cheese all scrambled together.  Eggs slightly overcooked and overall it was good, but again not $10.00 good.    

Now one item we had really stood out- their scones.  Yes, the cranberry lemon scones which was phenomenally delicious and whatever secret recipe they have, it works!

So don't get me wrong, this a great little breakfast place with some good people that try hard, but for the prices they charge I would expect something to have a bit more flavor and taste to really wow me."}
{"text":"Eaten there two days in a row. The banana pecan French toast is pretty mind blowing. The messy gooey eggs could feed an army, my twelve year old even threw in the towel 3/4 of the way thru!  Service is on point!"}
{"text":"Just okay. This breakfast place is very average. I'm not sure why it had such great ratings. We had veggie omelet which is made with garlic (not a great choice for eggs). Probably won't return."}
{"text":"This is the fourth incarnation of this restaurant site we have visited. This one is head and shoulders above the others. I had the $4.95 week day special 6:30 - 10:30 am. Didn't really expect much for that price, what a surprise! I ordered the sausages, which were very good quality, and the pancakes that were thick but very fluffy. The quality of the food is apparent. The coffee is organic free trade. My partner had an omelet she really enjoyed, and I tasted some of her whole wheat toast and jelly which was wonderful. We will be putting this one in the rotation."}
{"text":"I'm really happy we found this place. The french toast is the BEST I've ever had. It's like no other french toast you've had before. The fresh squeezed orange juice is heavenly. Service was top notch. My husband had an omelette and he said it was just okay (cheese wasn't melted) and, although it wasn't bad, it wasn't noteworthy. But he still liked the french toast enough so we'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Been here five times now. The first time I had the farmers market omelet. It had spinach, mushrooms, brussel sproutsand their house made pesto. It was wonderful. 

The next time we came, I got the chicken fried chicken with French toast and eggs. Ooohh! I had found my dish! Two tasty chicken breasts, topped with white gravy, batter coated French Toast, cage free eggs...AND fresh squeezed orange juice! 

The California garlic hot sauce they keep in the table is yummy! The frwsh made jelly is great on the fresh made toast.

No complaints. Always love being in the neighborhood at breakfast time so I can have an excuse to eat here! 

Try this place!"}
{"text":"Really good food!  All your typical breakfast choices made with really good ingredients, nothing foo foo, but top notch flavor!  The owner and his son are very present, every nook and cranny are clean and the wait staff seem to like working here!"}
{"text":"The tiramisu pancakes were AUHMAZING!! Great service, delicious food, and overall \"homey\" feeling as you walk in. just be sure to pack your patience because there will be a wait (for good reason)."}
{"text":"Not sure where all the stars come from, but it was just okay. Not bad, not good."}
{"text":"My girlfriend brought me here after raving about how delicious it is. Well, they definitely made a good impression from the beginning. Even though we were a party of two people and there was a table for two available, the gentleman who seated us realized that the available table was wedged between two crowded parties and might not be the most pleasant place to sit. After explaining this about 2 minutes later he came and directed us to a spacious booth. 

We did not tell him we did not want the table, he simply did this on his own accord. It may seem small gesture but it was a Saturday morning completely packed and I'm sure it would have been easier to get another party seated.  The front-end get 5 star rating, and the food was 5-stars as well.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Got to experience the Green Chili Pork Benedict today.  OMG!  Absolutely delicious...as always!"}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food! Freshly squeezed orange juice and it's refillable for free! The banana French toast was incredible! We will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"My son and I had never been here before, so we thought we'd try it out.  It's located in the same plaza as Alice Cooper's \"Church of Rock.\"  The service was spectacular and the food was absolutely delicious.  We will certainly go back and will highly recommend it to friends and family."}
{"text":"THIS Is 1 of the best \"Mom & Pop\" restaurants in the valley!  Our son & his wife found it first, then introduced it to us. Then food is cooked homestyle, like Mom or grandma used to cook. The orange juice is fresh squeezed & has pulp but, OMG, so worth it, with 1 free refill. The jelly is also made in house so only 1 flavor but, again,  very worth it. On the weekends,  there is always a packed house, with a long wait but the owner's have put up a canopy for people to sit under, out of the sun, & have free bottles of iced water for people to drink during the wait. Don't give up if you have to wait because it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Okay...where to start. Simply put, if we lived in Arizona, we would eat breakfast here all the time. My husband had the french toast and loved it. I had the chocolate raspberry pancakes and loved them, it was almost like eating dessert for breakfast. Though we each threw in eggs and bacon on the side. In addition, the fresh squeezed orange juice was excellent - the best we ever had. 

We went straight to the restaurant upon our arrival from Denver on a Saturday morning around 9:30 am and maybe had a 5 minute wait. The waitress was extremely friendly and service was fast. Then to top it off, the waitress surprised us and said an anonymous person bought our breakfast. We were beyond surprised and extremely grateful. That has never happened to us before in our lives! 

I would have left a great review without somebody purchasing our breakfast. The food is excellent for the prices and the service was perfect. The thoughtfulness of the other patron was just wonderful act of kindness which we really wish we could have thanked them. So if you read this, thank you for making our day and starting our trip out right! Definitely visit the Original Breakfast House for a delicious breakfast."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and service was great! Try the hot chocolate it is sooo creamy and good. We had a party of 7 and everyone raved about their particular dish, not one complaint."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast I've had since I live in Arizona and I'm talking about the since the 
1980s. My brother Dexter Hillman had referred me here because they had grits. But everything was good delicious fresh squeezed orange juice you name it it is all the bomb. When you go expect wait because I think everybody in Arizona knows about this place LOL"}
{"text":"I am currently training for a fitness competition so my diet is pretty strict.  Our waitress was incredibly kind when I asked for egg white substitutions, no oil, no salt, ect (my diet sucks).  Even with all the subs and request my omelet was delicious.  The have fresh squeezed orange juice every time we go for breakfast, tastes like I'm back in Florida.  I would highly recommend for anyone, diet or not.  A person at our neighboring table ordered the French toast, it was stacked sky high with fresh berries and powdered sugar!  Almost ordered, seriously it looked that good.  There was a wait, they quoted 30min for 3 of us but we were sat in 15 in a comfortable booth.  I don't want to drag this review along- just go there and eat tasty food."}
{"text":"Yes I've been Matt's... but OBH is still the best breakfast in Phoenix. Yes there is always a wait but it's worth it. The chicken friend chicken with the San Francisco style French toast is amazing. If you order it make sure you have a big appetite because the portion is very generous! On top of the amazing food the service is always great! I've been here many times and I've never had a server or worker that wasn't great! We had to move seats for accommodation once which was no big deal and the owner brought us a complimentary cinnamon roll. Love this place."}
{"text":"Nice little breakfast and lunch place. Kind of off the beaten path, but worth looking for. We sat at the counter so as to not have to wait, but the folks we talked to said the wait is usually not that bad. Clientele was a mixed bag. Lots of the railroad-spike through the nose crowd, but also a smattering of families and trucker-types. Specials were listed on a white board. They had a crab omelette that sounded great tho we decided to eat off the regular menu. My wife had the French toast which looked superb. In order to make our sugar rush a bit more interesting, we split the brioche cinnamon roll which was great. Don't think I've ever seen a cinnamon roll made from brioche dough; the inventor should patent the dang thing. I usually use Cinnabon as my baseline for cinna-rollage, but this li'l gem had my standard beat generously. The Smooveness of the dough was just superb and it wasn't overly gooey like some tend to be. 

Also ordered a side of biscuits and gravy which turned out to be the surprise of the meal. Man, that was one spanky side. The biscuit was fluffy and not really dense like most overworked ones you find at chain places. Plenty of sausage made this one a must have the next time I return. Couple next to us chowded down on them as a main dish. Big Larry say they knew what they were doing. 

Big Larry had the chorizo burrito that was served \"smothered\" style with a green sauce and cheese. Quite good; wish there was more sauce. 

Staff was friendly and helpful and good at cleaning up and seating folks. We didn't feel rushed, though. Left off a star or two for atmosphere and the noise level, but the food was excellent."}
{"text":"What a great place. Don't judge a book by the cover. Old establishment but inside the service and people are top notch."}
{"text":"We only had to wait about 15 minutes on a Sunday morning. The service was excellent and so was the food. I had the banana pecan French toast. One of our kids is not a breakfast eater and he was able to order a bacon cheeseburger."}
{"text":"We drove about 30 minutes (from the opposite side of town) based on the yelp reviews. We arrived b/w 8-8:30 am and waited about 30 minutes for a table after being quoted 15 minutes, but the weather was cooperative and they had ample seating/waiting space (outside) so no big deal. The customer service once seated was fantastic even though they were clearly very busy. Food: I'm sorry that I forgot to take pictures! Husband had the gooey scramble and I had the egg white scramble with a side of Bacon. The food did not disappoint. The hubby's gooey scramble was the highlight, but none of the food disappointed. I really enjoyed the breakfast potatoes and the house hot sauce is really good. The cinnamon rolls from the pastry case were calling my name, but i managed to resist. If I make it back there I MUST try them cause they look amazing, as did the home made pop tarts. My only constructive feedback would be some better coffee; the only thing of the meal that was so-so."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here, this place is absolutely amazing. Service superfast waitresses were super friendly very reasonably priced and hey a deep fry the French toast how could you not love it"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast spot next to Alice Cooper's charity thrift store. Show up hungry because the portions are large!  Everything you'd expect at a breakfast spot like pancakes, French toast, lots of great omelets, and lunch sandwiches too. Specials include pumpkin pancakes and reindeer sausage.  Be prepared for a wait on the weekends."}
{"text":"First time here, this place was AMAZING!!!!! We came on a Friday Morning at 8:00 am so no wait, but I can see it being super busy on the weekends. My fiancé got the biscuits and gravy and I got the carnitas omelette with the raspberry chocolate chip pancakes. All were awesome! Be warned that the portions are generous and to-go boxes were needed. They work with local growers and sausage makers. They bake their one pastries and biscuits. I can't rave enough about and can't wait to bring the rest of my family back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Best omelet and pancakes ever! I ordered the weekend special, the chicken Tinga omelet.  The omelets come with a choice of bread or pancakes and I chose pancakes.  The pancakes have a hint of lemon and are heavenly.  The home fries do not come out of a bag and I ate all of them, which is something I don't ordinarily do when eating at chain restaurants like IHOP.  However, the star of the meal was the chicken tinga omelet with boneless shredded chicken  breast cooked in adobo and topped with queso fresco - it was totally out of this world delicious!  I left full but not stuffed and will happily be adventuresome with menu selections in the future. The breakfast restaurants in Scottsdale are all overrated and believe me, I have tried them all.  This is my favorite breakfast spot in the Valley."}
{"text":"Great breakfast with large portions even for the kids menu! Everything fresh, organic and homemade when they can! Sat quickly and food came out quickly as well grabbed some homemade cinnamon rolls on the way out with our three to go boxes of leftovers!! Prices are good as well for the portions breakfast was 7-11.00 depending on what you order. Oh an don't forget the fresh squished OJ"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place out after seeing all the 5 star reviews. I will give them tons of credit for creativity when putting together their menu. Customer service is good. We like the fact that they use organic and local products. 

On to our experience. The other person in my party was taking a while to decide what he was going to have, so I ordered a lemon scone (which happens to be one of my favorite things). The server brought it to me and had heated it up pretty hot. I had never had a hot scone before. I didn't like it, she offered to bring me another (not heated), I accepted. But I still didn't like it. It seemed a bit stale and the taste wasn't great. I gave it away. Next, I ordered the chicken fried chicken. Comes with a piece of french toast and 2 eggs. The chicken was good and had a wonderful gravy, but they don't give you very much of it. I know the french toast gets lots of rave reviews, but we didn't particularly care for it. The deep frying process must make it that strange texture, kind of like chewing on a dish sponge. The other party ordered a Monte Cristo sandwich which comes with fruit, and then he added an order of homefries. We would not order the homefries again for the very small portion that is given. Neither of us liked his sandwich, so they brought him The Bomber burger (comes with fries) instead, it was very tasty. Fries aren't anything special - typical diner fries. We may go again in the future to give the omelettes a try. Total bill for 2 people (2 entrees, side of homefries, scone, 1 coffee) $35 plus tip."}
{"text":"My wife and I love the breakfast menu and daily specials. The French Toast is FANTASTIC and I am not a French Toast fan (until now). You are always greeted with a cheerful smile. The staff are friendly and courteous. The owner regularly makes the rounds and stops by to check on you. 
Try this place if you want a reasonably priced breakfast that tastes great!

We just tried the friday night fish fry for the first time tonight and it was great! The price was right and the food delicious as was expected. My wife had the shrimp alfredo and I had the 3 pc fish dinner. Both were excellent and the service was exactly the same as the breakfast crew delivers. The owner was there checking on everyone and we are sure this wont be our last fish fry here!

Sunday mornings can get busy but its well worth the small wait. I highly recommend OBH."}
{"text":"Definitely come with a hearty appetite. The food was pretty good but what really got us was the orange juice. I know, it's an odd thing to say but it is freshly squeezed and an amazing value. We will be back just for that. Otherwise, the service was great and there was nothing negative to say about the food. It was a good experience. We even had a cinnamon roll with icing to share before we had a chance to sit down. There's always a wait but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I read so many great reviews before trying this place out but wasn't blown away by the food. Still, it's nice to see a local joint with friendly staff instead of the mega chains taking over.  OBH has fresh-squeezed orange juice and you get a free refill on it. Their hash browns and sausages are very good. I found the french toast to be a bit hard and stale, which was disappointing.  And they don't have my all-time favorite breakfast item: eggs benedict."}
{"text":"Best diner breakfast I've ever had! This place is amazing. Today was my first visit and I'll certainly be back. Short 5min wait for a table, the food came out so fast, less than 10 min. Our server was great too. The manager kinda floats around and checks on tables. This place is a well oiled machine for sure."}
{"text":"Our favorite spot to Saturday's brunch. Love the fresh squeezed orange juice and the tasty coffee. The food is excellent and the staff very friendly. They are always busy for good reasons. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service!

My wife has been trying to get me in here for months since she and a buddy ate here - she gushed over the amazing french toast and described it in detail to me.  Sounded great, but we didn't get in with the whole family until today.

Wow - all I can say is wow.  First, pleasant smiles and a sincere \"How can I help you\" mentality from all the staff, from the hostesses to the waitresses to the buspeople.  Although everyone was hustling around full speed on a very busy Saturday morning, everyone was pleasant and actually seemed happy doing their thing!  We had a carafe of water at our table, and after we emptied it, I offhandedly mentioned to my wife \"We need some more water\", and a waitress from another section of the restaurant who happened to be walking by, stopped, asked if we'd like more water, and got it in seconds.  WOW.  I'd give the service 6 stars if I could.

I had the Firehouse Chili and Cheddar omelet, wife had the amazing french toast (again), son had the Hog Heaven omelet (ham + bacon + sausage - all pig, baby!)  Great food, great fresh squeezed orange juice, fresh strawberry jam made there in the restaurant, fantastic little touches that elevated a pretty good breakfast to a great one.

Owner stopped by to check in on us too.  We also saw him busing tables - what an example to his troops. He's the reason this place is what it is.  It's a great reflection on John and his commitment to excellence.

Come here, enjoy, come back often!  We will!"}
{"text":"This is in my top 5  favorite breakfast spots in Phoenix hands down. It's the perfect little neighborhood diner and I have yet to try something on the menu I don't like. The French toast is awesome and if you're looking for something different you have to try the chilaquiles.  One of my favorite parts is they leave the coffee pot on the table! 
Service is 5/5 every time. Everyone is always so friendly and not in the fake only doing it for a good tip kinda way. Genuinely nice people all around! 
The only down side is there's always a little bit of a wait on the weekends but there's plenty of seats in the waiting area and it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Great food for a decent price. They give you more than you need. Their coffee is good, and they leave the pot at your table! The waitress was awesome, very friendly and on top of her game. Would definitely come back for more!

Deep fried French toast, need I say more?"}
{"text":"Such yummy food. Staff is great and so kind. Owner is awesome and very interactive with guests and staff. Sometimes there's a wait but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Came back again for a late morning brunch with some lady friends after class. I love that we are greeted warmly by smiling faces. The food is always top notch, the French toast is amazing  and the oj is to die for. Freshly squeezed and you get a free refill! The owner is always there working, which means he truly cares about his business."}
{"text":"Okay, in full disclosure, I should say that the owner is from Monterey and both his breakfast place and sports bar were two of my favorite restaurants in town.  Hearing about his latest venture, I knew that my yearly AZ trip for Spring Training would include a stop here.  And boy, was I not disappointed!  The french toast is to die for.  A perfected version of the fried french toast he introduced us to in Monterey.  The Huevos Rancheros were excellent and the El Paso Omelette was spot on.  The OJ is freshly squeezed, and includes a free re-fill.  And the prices are ridiculously reasonable.  Excited for the new place and wish them the best of luck!  This will be a favorite when in town."}
{"text":"Not only was the food fast and delicious, the service was wonderful! The place was busy and still from the hostess to the gentleman bussing our table everyone had a smile on their face and was genuinely interested in our input. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place does not disappoint! The variety of food and the personal touch is crazy! If you're in the area you won't go wrong with breakfast..."}
{"text":"Great Experience. Wonderfull staff and efficient. Food also tastes very good! Everything was fresh cooked."}
{"text":"You need to eat here. The food is seriously amazing! I can honestly say that I was totally addicted to their raspberry chocolate chip pancakes throughout my entire pregnancy. I have since moved on to ordering their biscuits and gravy at every outing. The staff here is so friendly and welcoming. They have a the cutest decor, reminiscent of the 1970s with tie-dyed shirts and surfboards hung from the ceiling. There is usually a short wait on the weekends to be seated, but it goes by quickly. They have a covered waiting area and grass that the kiddos like to run through. They even offer complimentary bottled water for the guests while you wait. Can't get much better than that!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We drive 25 mins to come here! There is usually a wait in the AMs but it is worth it! If it is only a few people in your party you might get lucky and be able to grab a bar seat so you don't have to wait. The French Toast is amazing and the Breakfast Tacos are delish too!"}
{"text":"OMG. This place is incredible. Great experience! Food was delicious! Huge portions! Great service! Cash only- thought that was weird- but place has no fee ATMs. Who knew?! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Everyone at the Original Breakfast House is so nice! Our server was very sweet and attentive, as was the hostess at the front. It was nice to have such a variety of options to choose from. I ended up getting what I always get at breakfast places (pancakes and scrambled eggs), but it was nice to know that I could have gotten something else if I weren't so boring. I wasn't a huge fan of the pancakes- they said \"hint\" of lemon on the menu but I could smell the lemon 6 inches away. The orange juice was quite watered down. Overall, as friendly as everyone was, I don't think I'll be back because of the overwhelming lemon in the pancakes."}
{"text":"A taste of heaven! This family-owned establishment does not get the exposure that it so deserves. You get so much bang for the buck when you dine here. Not only is it inexpensive, but the entrees are pure pleasure for the palate. If I could eat breakfast here every morning I would, but the calories would soon catchup work me.

Customizable omelettes, pancakes, biscuits, ham, sausage, fresh orange juice, hash browns; you name it! If breakfast is this pleasing, I'm so anticipating dining here for lunch. They're open until 2pm.

The wait staff is very energetic and ready to accommodate. When you ask you additional condiments, napkins, etc., they bring it pronto! The tables are turned fairly quickly, so the wait isn't very long.

Try this place! It''ll be a great choice. :-)"}
{"text":"Have been on a quest to find a good down home cook breakfast. This was just ok. Service was great and better than the food. I had chicken fried steak and left 90%  of it on the plate."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried this place because a friend of ours recommended it. This was a great breakfast joint. Now they do serve lunch and dinner by breakfast was my first visit. The staff was friendly and the owners were very nice. They have large portions of food for a really reasonable price. If you are going to eat here make sure you bring cash because credit cards are NOT accepted here. They do have an ATM that has no fees because they cover the cost and they do take checks. They even have an honor system if you forget to bring cash they will take down your name and wait for you to return with the money.  I always thought people from California were rude and arrogant people, but this family that runs this place are a different type of  Californian. I promise you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast. Offers quality brekkie basics with a sprinkling of specials for those that are more adventurous. Service was great also - attentive, but not rushed."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the french toast here!  Almost tastes like fair food on steroids :) the service was great too!  I would definetly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Excellent!  As many have said before me but I will say it again.  Orange Juice was excellent!  I never order OJ because it comes in a small cup.  This came in a medium size cup and with a refill.  Cinnamon roll was solid.  The fried waffle was excellent.  Chicken fried chicken was moist and plenty of food for two.  
Great Place!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast- I had the El Paso omelet - good heat and wonderful flavored.  My companion had the banana pecan French Toast - we split our meals.  Delicious."}
{"text":"Have only had breakfast here but it's always been terrific. Food is excellent, large portions and outstanding service."}
{"text":"OMG We LOOOOOOOVE this place and its organic goodness But it's a wait on the weekends but sooooo worth it! Bring a dose of patience....you'll have a happy belly"}
{"text":"Food was good but the eggs tasted like they were
cooked on the grill with oil rather than butter. Orange juice was delicious with lots of pulp and tasted as if it was just squeezed. Waffles were fabulous and so so large. They were fried and crispy. Bacon was thick and tasty. Pancake special was definitely a special but an up charge for their special chocolate raspberry pancakes at $3.75 pushed it over the edge. Although breakfast was delicious, it was pricey at $38+ tip for two.  We'd go back but share a meal!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness I checked the \"popular times\" stats in google before coming here; through that, I found that on the day of my visit (Saturday), I needed to be there before 9 am to avoid a wait at this popular eatery. Arriving at 8:50 a.m., I was able to be seated even though the place was packed. But by the time I left, a big crowd was already waiting outside. And no wonder it is popular - it's easy enough to get to (near the Thunderbird exit of the 51), it has a very casual and informal vibe with Cali surf culture decor, you'll find here the friendliest staff on the planet, and the food - whoa! Hearty and satisfying as the portions are really generous, a lot of the ingredients are locally sourced and/or organic, and the prices are great. This is now my breakfast place of choice."}
{"text":"Good quick service, but don't let them set you at the table by the bathroom (which of course is the one we had) wait for a better choice. Both our meals had great flavor, looks like you cannot make any wrong choices here. Do get the orange juice. Don't drink the table water with its strange taste, stick to the coffee. We will definitely be back over and over, so we hope this restaurant will make it. (Location has switched hands several time over the last few years.)"}
{"text":"We were there today. Had visited several times before and invited family. We were first on the list for a table for 6. We \"accidentally\" got crossed off the list. The first person said \"I was out here and called Cathy and you didn't answer\" and another employee said I called the name and the people waiting inside took the table. At this point we had been waiting 40 minutes. We had to wait an additional 20 minutes for a table. 

The food was only Mediocre today and service was not that great. 

Very disappointing experience!!!"}
{"text":"After a less than ideal experience, I posted my dismay. The owner personally messaged me and apologized, extending an offer to return & give them another try, even sent a gift certificate to me. Visited again today, and sat in the counter area. Prompt service, delicious food, attentive wait staff. They have definitely redeemed themselves in my opinion! The owner walked by to check on the entire restaurant, and despite the wait and busy sunday there, all the staff were on top of things! Recommend the spam and eggs!"}
{"text":"Service was great.  But I am into a little more upscale food, less fattening, just a preference. If you enjoy just having the ol staple hearty breakfast, it's a good place to go."}
{"text":"The food was amazing!  And HUGE!  But no debit/credit.  Only CASH.  They do have a free ATM in the lobby for your convenience.  Very pleasant and attentive servers."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service, and a good selection. We went on a Friday late morning and had no wait."}
{"text":"To my dear friends in Phoenix -- When you are craving brunch/ breakfast next time, try to stop by the Original Breakfast House on 32nd St and Thunderbird. Fresh squeezed Orange juice, organic ingredients sourced locally and Everything freshly made! Unfortunately had to wait for 45 mins to get a table due to the long wait -- but was worth it! Check it out!!"}
{"text":"This breakfast/brunch joint is the hidden gem you hope to find when you want to escape from the generic boring IHOP'S and Dennys' of the world. I love restaurants that get creative with their menus! This place gives you plenty of options and offers a unique variety that will leave you so indecisive, you have to come back again to try something else! They also have daily specials that aren't on the regular menu and they are just as tempting when you aren't sure what you're in the mood for. 
I tried the fried bologna sandwich because it is something I've never had in my life. It was good, the sandwich was big, the grilled onions give it extra flavor and there's plenty of meat.  I don't know if I'd order it again, only because I'm not used to eating bologna when it's hot and it's not something I'd eat often, but there were plenty of other things I want to try in the future. 
I chose potato salad to go with my sandwich,  the tricky thing about potato salad is if you're making it while the potatoes are still hot,  you're going to get a funky taste once you add the dressing to it. It was okay,  but it was even better when I added California 3 pepper hot sauce to it. That hot sauce is magical! I'm going to buy a bottle or 2 when I go back. I wish I could buy a case, I have a feeling they will make an excellent sauce for hot wings!  They sell the bottles up in the front and there are 3 different kinds to choose from. They also have baked goods, I didn't try them yet,  but they looked good- nice and big in size. Prices are fair and comparable to other breakfast places, but I can tell you the flavor and quality rises waaay above the generic \"blah\" of soggy undercooked hash browns from the likes of Denny's. The waitress and manager were friendly and welcoming. 
***Try this place if you aren't boring, enjoy adventures and aren't one to settle for mediocrity!"}
{"text":"It's a mom and pop breakfast spot in the Phoenix area. We got lucky with a 20-minute wait since it was around 1130am.  Make sure to bring cash because they do not accept credit cards. There is a no-fee ATM machine inside.  

The service is beyond friendly here.  As soon as we were seated, our server offered to start us off with beverages.  We went with the organic fresh squeezed orange juice. It's so refreshing and sweet.  You even get a free refill. The juice goes so well with the hearty breakfast. 

Our breakfast choices:
**** \"Famous\" chicken fried chicken with fried French toast and 2 eggs.  The chicken is crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  It's topped with a country gravy.  Creamy and delicious!  The French toast was actually good deep fried and not greasy. 
**** Crab omelette: one of their weekend specials. 3 eggs with mozzarella cheese and large chunks of fresh crab meat.  Topped with the hollandaise sauce. Oh my so good!!  Add the hot pepper sauce and it will make your taste buds roar!!

We found our breakfast spot for the next visit to AZ.  Down home delicious breakfast and exceptional service. A must try when in the area."}
{"text":"This place would be slammed busy if it were in CenPho.  It is a great dinner with lots of yummy things for breakfast and lunch.  My favorite is the breakfast burrito.

btw, Milk Shake Mondays!  $2 all day.  I've not had one yet but they look great."}
{"text":"The French Toast is amazing! I have never had some like it before and I am one to always order it when out at breakfast. We also tried the Lemon Curd pancakes as part of their summer specials and they were good as well. Definitely something different to try and very sweet. We could only eat one. Also, they have these brioche cinnamon rolls. I got one to-go but they are baked fresh every morning! I have yet to try it. Last put not least, the staff is so friendly that it makes the experience even better."}
{"text":"Surf's Up! My Cali Breakfast Spot. Great food, friendly service. Specials rock, Cash only, Free ATM. Get here!"}
{"text":"I think the waitress' recommendation to come back on my cheat day pretty much sums up my visit.   I'm currently doing whole30 so was excited about the farm fresh commitment advertised on their website.   The omelettes we had were good and the green chili was exceptional.  The portions were large,  and you could get egg whites.   However, it looked like the deep fried French toast and pancakes were the better option.   Our very friendly, energetic waitress made sure to flaunt our neighbor's order past us.   It is a little crowded and loud,  but otherwise a good atmosphere. I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt, and will definitely be back on my cheat day."}
{"text":"Good food, service, prices, everything. 
*Be prepared to WAIT a long time for a table......so we took seats at the bar."}
{"text":"First timer. Staff is so nice. Place is so busy, good sign. Food was very good, although a bit over priced on some items. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Where to start.. The service was rather quick, and the waitress super welcoming. The food came out really quick. But let's just say food had no flavor. The omelette tasted bland, the potatoes was the only thing I liked on my plate and that's after adding pepper, salt, ketchup and hot sauce. :( my BF ordered the chicken and gravy with French toast and eggs... Mediocre food! The bathrooms were disgusting! Will not be coming back here"}
{"text":"On a Saturday morning at 930, we had about a 10 min wait. The staff was very friendly and the food was quick. We ordered the biscuits and gravy and the French toast.  Both were very good. They leave a carafe of water and a pot of coffee on your table so that you don't run low.  They serve cage free eggs, organic milk and focus on free trade for coffee. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Pancakes...wow...lemon surprise...yeah!
Service was quick and responsive. Food came out hot and timely. Hate waiting for a check? No problem, they've got you covered."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for brunch after hiking Camelback. Didn't have to wait too long even though there was a line out the door. The giant cinnamon rolls look better than they taste. Enjoyed the local vibe. The machaca was prepared differently than I am accustomed to, but it was ok. Nothing blew me away taste wise but the service was great."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now. It's super good. They did a great job remodeling the place. They use a lot of local ingredients so everything is super fresh and yummy. My wife even bought the strawberry preserves they get from Tucson and she's not even good at eating sweet things. Now if only the rest of the strip mall could class up their act like this place, we'd be in business!"}
{"text":"Great Place.. Always super busy but worth the wait.. Fresh squeezed OJ .. Never had bad service. Everyone is always so friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing local joint that cares about their ingredients! Family from California owns it and they are wonderful!  Get ready for a possible wait since everyone ?nows its great :)"}
{"text":"I was looking for a new breakfast place to go one day and saw this place on Yelp. So, me and my boyfriend gave it a whirl. When we went we got the green chili pork eggs and chicken fried chicken. It's nice because you can substitute any of there specialty pancakes or french toast instead of toast for like $1.50! We tried a piece of there french toast and chocolate chip raspberry pancakes. The food was so amazing! We liked it so much we went back exactly a week later. It was literally some of the best green chili pork I've ever had, so I got the same thing. My boyfriend tried the big messy scramble and the special pancake for the day which was the cinnamon roll pancakes. Omg, all was amazing again! Plus, the coffee was awesome as well! I'm a one cup girl, I think I had 3! This place is our new favorite for sure!

P.s. Ask for the server Seta or Seda (sorry I forgot the spelling) but she also made the experience wonderful. Very nice, attentive, started conversation, and knew everything about the menu. Just our luck we had her the second time we went as well. She's awesome!"}
{"text":"We decided on this place based on the strong reviews here on yelp. I was a bit disappointed. Coffee was very good, but expensive. I ordered the pork lovers omelette, my wife had the ham and cheese. Neither was cooked through. There was no bacon in my omelette. The service was slow and I had to ask 3 times to get water. One slice of toast with a small amount of jam is underwhelming. I really see no reason to return!"}
{"text":"This place was a nice surprise for me. Being from the East Valley, I usually don't make it out this direction very often. I had heard good things of the Original Breakfast House from many reliable sources and made a little time for a bite. I love the beach theme throughout the restaurant. The owner has his roots from California and renovated this place in 2011 after he moved to Phoenix. The staff was super friendly. OBH takes a modern twist on classic diner food and is known for their deep fried French toast. Some other items include linguica (smoke cured pork sausage), chicken fried streak, carnitas and Spam. I couldn't resist the desire to try their pork green chili omelette. The portion sizes are pretty large and my omelette was pretty loaded with pork, cheese and sauce that almost covered the entire entree. Their breakfast potatoes are nice and flavorful. Even though I didn't order any, my eyes were drawn to the pastry display where I saw some delicious looking homemade pop tarts. This is a great addition to the West Valley and I had a nice experience. Just a heads up - they only accept cash."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfasts of ALL TIME!!!  I'm not even exaggerating.  I loved everything about my first experience here.  The food was of phenomenal quality.  The staff was impossibly friendly and smiling at all times.  The atmosphere as a whole was incredibly welcoming and comfortable.  In many ways Original Breakfast House (OBH) is amazing because of how simple and old fashioned their approach is.  They put their own twists on some of their breakfast fare, but a lot of what you're getting here is just what you'd normally expect, only better.  Allow me to elaborate.

The Arizona Restaurant Association (known as the creators of the wildly popular Arizona Restaurant Week) decided to give the breakfast crowd some love by rolling out their first annual Arizona Breakfast Weekend in late summer.  Similar to Restaurant Week, a number of valley restaurants roll out breakfast specials at discount prices to entice the masses.  Among the entrants this year was OBH.  I'd tried dining at OBH two years ago on a Saturday, but the line was so long it would've make Matt's Big Breakfast blush.  So I took a pass.  This time, I took no chances.  When I drove to 32nd Street & Thunderbird this time, I made sure to arrive right at their 6:30am opening on Saturday morning.  Fortunately I was able to get a seat quite easily this time around.  A quick note that they have a breakfast bar area up front if you're like me and coming here by yourself (though this time they gave me my own booth in the corner).  

Most of OBH's breakfast fare is your traditional stuff.  Omelettes, pancakes, biscuits, potatoes, etc.  Today for Arizona Breakfast Weekend however they had a special dish that immediately had my name all over it.  A three egg omelette stuffed with crab and jack cheese and topped with a hollandaise sauce.  Yes please.  The dish also came with potatoes any style (I went hash browns), plus a bread of choice (I went with their house made buttermilk biscuit).  Since I'm a sucker for brioche bread and cinnamon rolls, I also got (appropriately enough) one of their house made brioche cinnamon rolls.  I also got two servings of their fresh squeezed orange juice to boot.  Total cost for all the food, tax, and tip came to about $25.

For starters, yes the OJ is great.  I'm not a fan of orange pulp, but the juice was so good I didn't even care this time around.  Let's talk about this omelette.  They did not mess around with the portion of crab.  Holy moly the crab meat must've been close to an inch diameter inside that omelette.  No complaints here as both the crab and hollandaise sauce were both incredibly rich and decadent.  Amazing dish.  Most people probably would be full after they had this, but I pressed on because, well, I had more delicious food right in front of me.  The hash browns were good as well, but pretty much like most hash browns you've had elsewhere.  The biscuit came with a side of butter and strawberry preserves.  The biscuit was incredibly flaky and buttery by itself so there was almost no point to adding even more butter.  But with a dollop of their house strawberry preserve on top?  Just fantastic.  Lastly, there's the brioche cinnamon roll.  I probably would've eaten a whole batch of these if they put it in front of me.  They didn't skimp on the icing on this thing, but the star of this dish was the bread itself.  There's just something about the light, puffy, buttery texture of brioche that always ropes me in.  Combined with cinnamon and warm icing and I'm basically in fat kid heaven.  

As mentioned earlier the staff here was incredibly friendly, smiling, and energetic (almost alarmingly so) despite being so early on a Saturday.  By the time I left around 7am, the place was starting to fill up.  In talking to the staff, it sounds like getting here before 8am is the optimal time to avoid a wait.  The place can seat a lot of people, but I can see why even a breakfast spot this big still commands a line.  Huge props to John Stidham who came out of retirement to bring this little corner of an otherwise nondescript shopping center to life and gave the Phoenix area an incredible breakfast gem.  What a meal.  What an experience."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time during a Saturday morning breakfast rush. There was a wait list and they were packed with people. The wait to sit was about 20mins with around 12-15 party's a head of us. He said 15-20mins but because of so many people I was expecting to wait at least 30. He obviously knew better than I did. Very impressive. Despite being full and busy our food came out in maybe 10 minutes if that. It was incredibly fast. It was also delicious. My server (who I regrettably can't recall the name of or I would happily share it) (if you read this we were the table with the toddler laughing up a storm at the little fish game on my phone.) recommended the Juan Tacos and she was on the money. She found time to check on us multiple times. As someone who has worked in the restaurant business for almost a decade, I don't think I have ever been more impressed with the efficiency combined with service of a restaurant than I was this morning.  You can have great servers and great managers. This place appears to have both in spades. I can't wait to come back again very soon."}
{"text":"It was ok. I had the pork chops, eggs, hashbrowns,  and biscuits and gravy. The biscuit and gravy was not good had a sweet taste. The biscuit where mealy.  EVERY THING NEEDED SALT!! I don't think the cooks even had salt. My wife's was the same. Service was great that's the only reason it gets 2 stars."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! If you're a Veteran like me, I highly recommend the Creamed chipped beef-- One bite and you'll be right back in a mess hall! The orange juice is fresh squeezed and worth every drop! It's cash only, worth any wait, and they have super friendly staff, too. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great place. Excellent choice. Great pancakes and amazing French toast dessert type toast."}
{"text":"So good.  The bacon: perfection.   The french toast : to dies for.  The pancakes : oh my  stars, the blackberry  ones were so good and fluffy.   But the standout  for me was the sausage.  It was delicious, so good that I had to finish it, no matter how full I was.   The service was great too.  Very warm, family style feel."}
{"text":"Great family owned neighborhood breakfast place - fresh food, mostly from local sources, extensive gluten-free options.  It's been jumpin' every time we've gone.

I've tried a few of the breakfast options: San Francisco style french toast; banana-pecan pancakes; biscuits and gravy; Spam and eggs; the Big Gooey Scramble Mess (share that one); - all good.  

Last time, the daily special was an \"Indiana Style Pork Tenderloin Sandwich\" - had to order that, since those are few and far between outside of the Hoosier home-state.  It was pretty darned good (I like it plain, with mustard and lots of pickles - give it a try!).

The coffee is good, and the servers keep you topped off (or leave a carafe for you).

Service is great, and everyone we've encountered on the staff has been great.

This is a great local place to hang out, grab a bite, and support the community (the restaurant, and their suppliers).  Come check them out!"}
{"text":"Uncle Nicks Fish House is at OBH on Friday nights from 5-8pm.  Limited menu but the fish is delicious!  I had the 
Mahi Mahi lightly breaded fish , slaw and fries.  Fish was done to perfection, the coleslaw was homemade and they give you cornbread cheese and jalapeño muffins.  They also give complimentary snicker doodles.

We are regulars for the OBH breakfasts and now will be regulars at Nicks!"}
{"text":"I am so glad that finally a good business took over this place after a countless failed attempts in the past. I no longer live in the area but I make sure we stop there whenever we are in the area. The food is fantastic, love the fresh squeezed OJ and I get a huge smile when I see the lines. Keep doing what you're doing guys"}
{"text":"I was very in love with the environment and great customer service. They were super nice , very cute decorating and great food. I really enjoyed my time there and I liked that it's such a family friendly place !"}
{"text":"Authentic old school breakfast house.  Friendly and busy. Genuinely nice staff. Very good food. You should come here and eat."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. I have had the chicken friend steak with over easy eggs and home fries with 2 chocolate chip/raspberry pancakes. Each order of fresh squeezed OJ comes with 1 complementary refill. 
Everything tastes very good and obvious high quality ingredients used. 

Friendly and efficient staff."}
{"text":"Soo good!! Love the food, and atmosphere. They are always busy on weekends so prepare to wait, but overall delicious tasteful food. You can't go wrong! I ordered the chicken fried chicken at the time. Like I said, you can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Coffee is locally roasted and really good. The blackberry French toast is fantastic!  Yogurt and fruit parfait was tasty and even on the healthy side. The place was really busy while we were there and service was still better than most places. We will be back"}
{"text":"This was a clean quaint place I really enjoyed the breakfast and the company the staff was very hospitable.
Although my steak did not come out as I ordered, they were more than happy to cook me a new one and it was perfecto as well as the entire breakfast. A bit of a drive for me from surprise Arizona but well worth the trip and I didn't even get sick afterwards!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are breakfast food lovers and we LOVE going out to breakfast. We found this place through Groupon and we were happy to find something close to our house and close to the kids swim lessons place. How convenient for a sat morning post swim! We gave it a shot and thought it was just ok. The food was mediocre at best and the service was below average. We knew they had just opened so we wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt. 

We went again today and had an even worse experience. First off, my four year old ordered a waffle and the server told us they don't have waffles there! WHAT?!? Isn't that a pretty basic breakfast staple? Then we noticed three dead flies in the window sill. Gross. Not to mention all of the flies flying around the restaurant (this is because they leave the back door to the restaurant open- my guess is because the bathrooms have this horrible smell). The food came and again, it was lackluster. My husband's omelette was burned. Two hot plates were placed right in front of my one year old- common sense people! Once the food was dropped the server never came by our table again. The only thing that was good was the orange juice and that they offer a free refill- that's if you can get one. Our server walked right by and watched me take my last sip of oj. I assumed she would bring another but I ended up asking a busser.   Once a fly landed in my daughters syrup and couldn't get out we decided we were done with this place. We then had to ask another server to find our server to bring our check. 

Needless to say we will not be back. We will be going back to our favorite place that has waffles and great service! Might have a long wait to get in but now we know why. 

It's too bad because this place has potential."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. We were on vacation in the area, staying at a hotel by the airport. We were looking for a brunch spot, but weren't interested in the long wait that typically comes with brunch. So, I Yelped this place and it seemed off-the-beaten-path enough to mean there wouldn't be a wait. We got there and waited about 15 minutes for a table. Not bad for brunch. Between the two of us, we split the chorizo burrito and french toast with strawberries. GREAT decision. Both dishes were excellent! Service was also excellent. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast food. LOVE their french toast. The kitchen busts out the food quickly but with great flavor."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE this place. We just for went today for the third time. So far every time we have gone we have Seta as a waitress and she is the best! So friendly and attentive. & the food is absolutely amazing. Haven't had anything I didn't like. Good prices and great portions 
Must try the cinnamon roll!! Heaven!!"}
{"text":"Really good food nice friendly staff. I recommend the French toast or the brioche cinnamon bun. Hubby likes the omelets and the bacon. Great casual place to have breakfast"}
{"text":"When I went it was packed, we had a bit of a wait, which I don't mind for good food. It was nice inside, but small. I remember the food being okay, if you're in the area check it out but it's not worth making a special trip for. The breakfast meat is expensive for how little you get, and it doesn't taste that great either. They up charge you for maple syrup, just get the regular syrup, you won't be able to tell the difference. The pancakes were alright, I think I had apple cinnamon or something like that. Not the worst breakfast I've had but not the best."}
{"text":"Had the strawberry French toast. Although it tasted pretty good, I think the bread needed to be soaked more in the egg batter. When biting into the bread, it was dry and tasteless. I deducted a star for that, as well as for the fact that they don't have any lattes there. What can I say? I was visiting from LA! Haha The cinnamon roll is a sugar lover's dream. I would suggest going for one of their pastries."}
{"text":"Awesome yummy five egg white dish and gluten free pancakes! And who knew they do a fri night fish fri w choc molten lava cake!"}
{"text":"Off to a great start when my hubby spotted Pepper Plant, his favorite hot sauce, on the table. Add some delicious fresh squeezed orange juice and a pot of coffee, not just a cup, on the table. We were really hoping that our food lived up to expectations...

It did. Very good egg scramble and pancakes, which are a substitution for bread. Love it! Very good service, too."}
{"text":"Staff is great. 
Food is not. 
The food is not super bad, but it lacks any flavor. Not overly greasy. If you like bland, this is your place."}
{"text":"Amazing cinnamon roll, Excellent customer service, so good the wait can be long but worth the wait."}
{"text":"We have passed on this place so many times in the past because when we drove by there were a bunch of people outside waiting. We got lucky this morning and there was no wait. 

The place was clean and bright and the staff was all very friendly and helpful. Everyone had a smile on their face which is something you don't often see. The selection is large, as are the servings. The service was fast but we never felt rushed. I had the ham and cheddar omelette which came with hash browns and pancakes. It was way too much food to eat but I certainly tried. The omelette was loaded with meat and cheese and absolutely delicious. My husband had the chili omelette. It sounds like a strange combination but he loved it. Our son had the bacon and pancakes off the kids meal which was more than enough food for him. We easily could have taken food home but since we errands to run we left it behind. Breakfast for the three of us with beverages was just under $30 and well worth it.

Quick update...it's been two years since I first reviewed this place and I was back there again yesterday and it is just as delicious. Even on a Thursday morning there was a short wait for a table but it's worth it!

Just an FYI, as of 9/1/17 they will be cash only. They did however just put a ATM machine by the entrance for those who show up without cash."}
{"text":"One of the best places for breakfast in town.  Great food and accommodating staff.  Vegan options and a flexible kitchen staff that is willing to adjust ingredients to account for differing dietary needs."}
{"text":"Great food. Great atmosphere. Felt like i was at grandma's house. Very friendly environment."}
{"text":"My boyfriend LOVES the French toast here! I've never seen fried French toast before it's definitely interesting. I got biscuits and gravy which weren't great but weren't bad either. Service was alright, nothing exceptional.."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Always so friendly and accommodating. The staff here are great and the owner is always so happy to talk with you! I love the food, my place to go for breaskfast."}
{"text":"Friendly service from the time you step into the door until you leave.  

We got the hot chocolate, fresh squeezed Oj, ooey gooey scramble and the French toast. 

Hot chocolate was the size of a soup cup and perfectly topped with whip cream!

Fresh squeezed Oj WITH a free refill. Where else can you get that??

My husband and I could have easily shared the scramble. I ended up taking half home. 

My 8 and 10 year old ordered French toast off the adult menu. They would have been just fine ordering from the kids menu or sharing one adult meal.  We took over half home. 

We're from out of town and so happy we found this place.  Thank you Yelpers!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I like to brunch so we chose this place due to Yelp reviews and location. I really love the vibe it's super cute and reasonably priced. My friend is a vegetarian and didn't see anything with that label on the menu but she was told she could have anything she wanted any way she wanted. So that was cool  
The location is great and the parking was easy.
I had an artichoke bacon goat cheese omelette it was fabulous, fruit and a BIG fluffy biscuit with butter and jam YUMMY it was the \"BOMB\".
So we were two ladies who wanted to chat and have a \"catch up\" and we were
Seated next to the loudest family with two toddlers crying. That was a bummer but it's ok, we could have said something but we didn't.
This is a CASH only establishment and that was quite a suprise but it IS posted when you walk in and hey have an ATM ?.
I had cash so that was ok as well, but if I hadn't I tend to be a little persnickety about such things. Now I know and all is good. 
So anyhow they have everything breakfast and they have amazing baked goods ugh!! 
I will return and try something new, can't wait!"}
{"text":"Service is on fleek.  The wait is long sometimes but the food comes out quickly when you decide what you want.  I think most things are pretty dang good.  The San Fran french toast was not my thing, but I can see with some fruit topping it would be good.  The biscuits and gravy were good but last time we went it was a bit too salty.  I'd still go back though, hash browns and potatoes are very good and always crisp."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places in Phoenix. I've tried most things on the menu and they don't disappoint. The fresh orange juice is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time and it was FANTASTIC! Definitely going to be mine and my husbands Sunday spot!"}
{"text":"I love this breakfast place! Close to home with amazing French toast. There was a wait on a summer morning the first time we went and they provided cold water bottles while we waited! A nice touch for an Arizona morning!"}
{"text":"The food here is great. Came here with a friend for Friday brunch and it did not disappoint. It has a nice little mom and pop vibe to it that creates a very welcoming atmosphere. They serve their ice coffee in a root beer mug that they constantly refill, it turns out to being a lot of coffee throughout the course of the meal. My friend got the lemon custard pancakes and I got their country fried chicken special. The portions here are incredibly generous and I would be surprised if most people could finish all their food. In fact I didn't see anyone around me that did. 

There was a bit of confusion when I ordered actually and I thought the fried chicken came with their hashbrowns, which look and smell amazing. I'm glad I didn't get the hashbrowns because I would not have been able to eat them at all. 

I would highly recommend Original Breakfast House. Definitely one of the better breakfast diners north of Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Their OJ has the texture of milk. It is so strong I have to add ice to it. Hubby loves the coffee here. Everyone seems real sweet and happy. A bunch of hippies from the Bay Area."}
{"text":"Never in my life have I ever felt compelled to try fried steak. It sounded cheap & terribly unhealthy.  But after seeing all of these fellow yelpers hold the Chicken Fried Chicken in such high regard, I had to try it. Also, it comes with FRIED French toast. It does not get any better than this. The chicken was juicy & flavorful & the waffle sealed the deal. Comfort food at it's finest. 10/10 would smash"}
{"text":"Man oh man, I am sad I waited so long to check this place out! First lets start with those cinnamon rolls...omg...the best! The chicken fried chicken special is amazing, always crispy & the gravy is some of the best. They have really delicious & crispy fries too! Love coming here for breakfast. We always try to get there before 8am on the weekends otherwise the line can be pretty long for a table."}
{"text":"Food was outstanding along with the service.  Went two mornings in a row when I was in-town, and will go again if it's convenient to me next time I am over that way.
My order came promptly and was cooked perfectly.
Serving staff was as pleasant and helpful as any you find in the finest restaurants. Their only response to any request was \"absolutely.\"
The owner, Jim, was there both mornings I was there and very actively involved.  Watching him in action made it easy to see the reason the place is so outstanding.  It's a direct reflection of him.
Pricing was more than fair.
Decor was nothing fancy but who cares? I don't know about you, but I'll give good food, outstanding service 5 stars every time."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  An extensive menu offering many delicious items.  Service is always good and attentive!"}
{"text":"We've been coming here for years as the deep fried French toast and fresh squeezed orange juicer is killer. However, the last time I ate here the bill was $75 for 4 people. C'mon- for breakfast?! The extreme raise in prices have caused us to never come back. So unfortunate."}
{"text":"Every time I have family/friend in town I always bring them here! Food is delicious and affordable! One of my favorite spots! The employees are very helpful, sweet, and always with a smile on their faces!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for breakfast in the area. Their homemade pancake batter is delicious. My fav meal is the farmers market omelette and add chicken. Staff is always friendly and very fast even when there's a huge wait."}
{"text":"I don't even like to eat breakfast and cannot believe how much I loved the food here. 
Definitely a YES!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here, 

Holyyyy craaaaap! So AMAZING!
Service was on point, food was on point!
I had the corned beef hash which was the daily special, and a cinnamon roll, and orange juice, (don't judge me, it was my first time here so I wanted to try everything haha)
It was so delicious 
The orange juice is freshly squeezed, and you get one free refill.
The cinnamon roll, which i shared with a friend, was so fluffy and soft.... mmm.
The corned beef hash was soooo good. It was served with choice of toast or biscuit, and I chose a biscuit. It was so fluffy and soft as well. 

The service was so awesome,  and the host was so sweet. 

My new favorite breakfast place for sure, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! My boyfriend and I love trying different breakfast spots and we definitely are impressed. My only complaint is the wait. We were told the wait would be 30min and we waited 50 min. Other than that, we would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I always thought your food was great, but like some of the others reviewers, my husband and I decided we will not be back since you stopped accepting credit/debit cards.  I understand that you say you installed a free ATM, but I was extremely worried that my bank would still charge a fee to use the ATM although the restaurant would not.  We ended up paying mostly in change which was inconvenient and slightly embarrassing.  Luckily we had enough cash to tip the waitress in bills rather than a bunch of change, but I do not want to have to deal with that again."}
{"text":"This was our favorite breakfast spot for our week trip to Phoenix for Spring Break.  Everything my family ate was delish.  We were seated, greeted and order taken quickly - service was prompt and was great.  We will return when we are back in the Phoenix Area.  The biscuits and gravy were flavorful and filling.  My son loved the Hot Chocolate!  We will be back!

D."}
{"text":"We went there on a Sunday so this will explain the long waiting line that lasted almost an hour, the staff were very nice and welcoming, I ordered the apple sausage scrambled eggs, the taste was good but the portions were small compared to other places, the pancakes were delicious!
Overall I would give them 4 stars because honestly I expected more than I got."}
{"text":"The pancakes here are amazing. I love the hint of lemon. The staff is super friendly and overall service is great."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast spot they have cute little seating outside or you can wait because the place is always packed. They have water for you to drink outside. The breakfast here is amazing. They even have homemade cinnamon rolls! Yummy."}
{"text":"So happy with this place today!!  I had the French toast and I highly recommend it!! It's like French toast and funnel cake mixed into one. Don't miss out on this place if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Took kids here over the summer.  My 13 yr old son researched good breakfast places and heard terrific things about this one. First off, the service was great. Our server was very attentive and had a wonderful attitude. It was very busy even for a weekday. The food was ok. Basic breakfasts. My son had french toast, was crunchy and wasn't a fan. My veggie omelette had too many undercooked onions.  My other kids liked theirs. The atmosphere was nice but they definitely need to change the flooring.  How they feel carpet is sanitary for a restaurant, I don't know. Don't feel we will go back.  Also heard they no longer take credit cards."}
{"text":"Came here based off Yelp reviews while on vacation. My mom and I came on a Sunday morning around 11 and only waited about 10-15 minutes. Our server, Andrea, was very attentive and kept checking on us to make sure we had everything we needed. My mom and I both ordered the chicken apple sausage scramble and it was amazing. It was so much food that I couldn't even finish it. They have a little display window with pastries that you can order (to eat there or to-go). The only slight downfall is that the tables are pretty close together, I could easily heard what the table next to us was talking about, and I'm sure they could hear us. Aside from that, service and price was perfect."}
{"text":"Great secret for locals.  You must try the shrimp and grits!  Everything is good and nice service.  You may have a wait on weekends"}
{"text":"Great food and fantastic service, I was traveling on business and I was a little taken back that they only accepted cash, but I did have enough green backs to cover my wonderful breakfast, they also have a ATM conveniently located in the lobby."}
{"text":"Use to be good, However I don't carry cash on me. Now I refuse to go to the bank just to get CASH just so I can buy breakfast. They lost my business.I owned my termite business 15 plus year's & use to take clients out for breakfast & lunch all the time. Any restaurant that doesn't take credit cards I feel was ridiculous and I would never take my clients out and carry that much cash. Guess they want to stay small and Don't want to spend a couple pennies to make a couple thousand. That's just bad business in my opinion."}
{"text":"Ok - this was such a treat to find this place. The hostess was warm, you could tell loved the place, and even the owner behind the place.   The French Toast was amazing - never had anything like it.  The chorizo omelet was excellent.   Loaded fries awesome.    Could tell that they prided themselves in fresh ingredients, not the nasty premade stuff sold by food distributors.     Best chorizo I think I have ever had?"}
{"text":"I have eaten there dozens of times and it makes you feel like it's the old fashioned family owned diner, maybe it's because it is.  Quality ingredients make the food amazing.  I have become a regular there. 5 stars"}
{"text":"DON'T LOOK ANY FURTHER AND JUST COME HERE!!! 

Came in this morning for breakfast based on the 700+ reviews with the 4.5 star rating. I must say I was not disappointed. I have the chicken and French toast, and finished the whole thing. 

Seta was our server and she was absolutely wonderful. Great personality, friendly, and truly passionate about what they are doing here. I must say I'm excited to come back."}
{"text":"We ventured off the beat and left Scottsdale to find a new place. No regrets. I now have a favorite place in a Arizona to go for breakfast. 

Found this place on Yelp. Love ya Yelp. Service and food was fantastic. 

I am a breakfast freak by nature and this place defiantly delivered. Came during the week before 9 and walked right in. Ordered the blueberry pancakes with a hint of lemon. Pretty good. Not bad at all. Blueberries are not freshly picked but I was ok with that. If that keeps the prices down it fine with me. We also ordered the steak and eggs. The steak was seasoned and cooked to perfection. You could tell someone was passionate about the product that they were going to deliver. In fact it was so good I had to ask what kind of seasoning they used on the steak. The owner came over and spent time telling us about the seasoning and the steak. Nice touch. 

I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I am always in search of a good breakfast spot and when I read all the great reviews I had high hopes for this place. We visited a couple of weeks ago. For starters, the hostesses weren't overly friendly. Also, they only accept cash payments. There was an ATM in the building but still, a bit inconvenient if you are not prepared. We enjoyed the fresh squeezed orange juice. The food was good overall though I was not at all impressed with the pancakes or the french toast. The coffee we got was barely warm and almost out, the waitress never returned with more. Snooze remains a favorite."}
{"text":"the pancakes are great. it's very crowded and derive can be slow. i think have a lot of patience when you arrive as it can be along wait."}
{"text":"The food is excellent and the service usually is also. My dislike about this restaurant is that the tables are lined-up so people from different parties must sit next to each other. Because of this, I only go there at the very least crowded times. It seems a liitle expensive. 

I like to support this business because they decorate for Christmas using Christmas symbols, rather than decorating for the generic \"holidays\"."}
{"text":"We had the opportunity to try the OBH , wife an I were down from CA to watch the Giants vs D -Backs and were looking for a Good place to have Breakfast. Searched Yelp and this place had over 2k reviews and new we need to try it . 
All I can say is the wait is worth it , we arrived around 11am and waited about 40 minutes to be seated , temps were over 100 degrees and they had a nice cooler with bottles of water for those that were waiting to keep cool . Decor was cool . Surfer beach theme felt as if I was back home by the beach . I ordered the banana and pecan French toast and WOW !!! I have never had French toast this way , very fluffy and not dry , wife enjoyed the biscuits and Gravy that were freshly made and nice and soft with Great taste . I wouldn't highly recommend if your in the Phoenix area it's a must try .... thanks for the Great Breakfast"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, drove car from this place and was not disappointed. There was a decent amount of wait due to it being packed but once we got seated the service was great and in a timely manner. Started off with an iced coffee which was really good and a blueberry muffin which we all enjoyed. We ordered French toast special and a side of hash browns and they were delicious. Will definitely recommend the place for breakfast/brunch"}
{"text":"Possibly best breakfast place in town. Everything fresh.  Great service, very well run. Its always busy but they handle it like pros. Portions are bigger than my liking but most people won't have a problem with that."}
{"text":"This place is the best breakfast house in Phoenix! The  New Mexico green chile is what lured me in and the atmosphere, friendly staff and amazing food keeps us coming back! The decor in this place is so warm and inviting... You've got to try this place! I'm sure when you do, you'll keep coming back just like we do!
Go get you some OBH!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The food is really delicious.  The reason they didn't get 5 stars from me is the terrible kids Mac 'n cheese. It was simple Kraft out of the box, served lumpy and dry, not fresh, definitely nuked and then sat a bit. Really? Come on!"}
{"text":"It's a cheep quick meal which is nice. The pictures look a bit better than the actual taste, but overall it was enjoyable. I would most likely not return, but if you are looking for a cheep meal then go for it."}
{"text":"This place was delicious!!! Customer service was amazing! Our whole family was super happy with their food:) the plates are a generous size and at a great price point. Well presented and very clean. Our waitress was wonderful. We are from Tucson and I will definitely be coming back when I visit Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! We had to wait about 35 minutes before being seated, which is normal for a popular restaurant. Once seated, service was great. I ordered the El Paso Omelette with sausage added and that came with a hash brown and your choice of toast, biscuits, or pancakes and I loved having those options. I was able to try the pancakes and they were yummy as well as the omelette. All for a reasonable price too!!"}
{"text":"My family enjoyed our breakfast here. Of course we had to wait...about 40 minutes....But that's to be expected anywhere on a Saturday morning. The food was all very good, as was the service. The big windows that wrap around the building are nice too."}
{"text":"Great local breakfast place, The staff is super friendly and everything on the menu we've tried has been really fresh and super delicious. We've started bringing our out of town visitors here and they all agree, The OBH is an awesome breakfast place."}
{"text":"Yummy! Home-cooked traditional breakfast goodness made with love."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, stopped after finding a hair in the BLT, a long hair.
Decided to try again today. Got the cheese burger, a very strange piece of meat. When the burger was served it looked like a nice patty, but when cut in half the center was like a fast food patty, half of the burger had only cheese with some meat, I cannot really give a proper description of this hamburger, it was like the patty was pressed paper thin in the middle with the edges looking nice and thick and only 3/4 of the bun had meat. I won't be returning to this restaurant"}
{"text":"Went here looking for a new breakfast spot and found it!! The wait was as expected for Saturday morning breakfast joint. They also have a covered area outside and complimentary cold water bottles while you wait so the time goes by fast. Their staff is friendly and the food amazing! Get the breakfast tacos with chorizo (SO good and they are BIG). We will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place. They do breakfast right. Always worth the wait. Friendly staff, food is served hot and fast. I have never had anything bad on this menu.  The brioche cinnamon roll will change your life and make your tummy warm inside."}
{"text":"Bummed. So many good reviews so I had high expectations. We ordered the El Paso omelet (chorizo,beans,peppers,onions), the raspberry chocolate pancakes, and the fried chicken/french toast. Orange juice to drink.

Pros: 
Excellent orange juice 
Friendly service
French toast was delicious

Cons: 
Omelette was terrible. Nothing is cooked into the eggs, rather scooped in. This caused a soggy omelette. Chorizo seemed like seasoned ground beef. Proportions of filling to egg was completely off. My guess is canned beans and peppers. I would have sent it back if the waitress had come by. 

Pancakes looked great in the menu but did not live up to the picture. Not fluffy nor flavorful. 

Fried chicken was chewy. Flavor was not bad but it was tough. 

I really wanted to love this place as so many have before. I don't know if they were having an off morning or if this is standard."}
{"text":"Wow I'm full. Thanksgiving flavors for breakfasting. What is this? It's good. Matter a fact so good it was taken off the menu because of so many orders. That's the turkey and sweet potato hash. I recommend it.  

Words to the wise. Come early. This place gets packed. If you order toast with spread make sure to get double spread comes a little on the light side.

Friendly service is always welcome too."}
{"text":"Great people!  Brought my family from Guam .  They loved the food.  It was hot as hell outside and the cool refuge in the restaurant was welcomed.  The only bad experience was that our apple juice was old and it had lumps in it, but they gladly changed it."}
{"text":"What a quaint little place. The food was yum yum and the prices were fair. The size is very small and wait averages 20 minuets by a small section of the door way. Server was nice, only down part was his shift ended at 1pm and no one came by to check up on us. They only take cash, fee free atm available inside. Recommend this place for breakfast."}
{"text":"We drove 25 minutes to get to this place based on the Yelp reviews.  It was definitely worth the trip.  We were greeted and seated very quickly, and ordered the fresh orange juice which was very good.

Between the whole family, we had eggs, pancakes, an omelette, bacon, and sausage.  Everything was pretty good, and we had a great time and enjoyed the excellent service.  We went on a Wednesday morning around 10 and it was about half full.

The bill with the tip was 52 bucks for four of us, which was a little pricey, but we enjoyed ourselves so I would say that's the point.  Sure, we could have gone to McDonald's for 12 bucks, but that isn't really the point.

We were on vacation and it was fun to go to a new place."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here Sunday I had the linguese sausage  w/ eggs and hash browns every thing  was delicious except the linguese which was dry and over cooked  service was great"}
{"text":"A friend and I came here for breakfast yesterday. He had the steak and eggs and I had the John Western omlet with hash browns and it came with 2 pancakes. The amount of food was great! Was able to take some for leftovers. Everything was so fresh and yummy.  My friend said it was the best steak and eggs he had this week. He tried 2 other establishments and this one was the best he'd had. I would definitely come back and I would definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"First thing I noticed was this place is super clean!  Décor was bright and cheery. My bf & I both had the El Paso omelets w/ hash browns. Very good! Love that they offer iced coffee. Our waitress was friendly & attentive. She even put some iced coffee in a to-go cup for me. My new favorite breakfast spot!!"}
{"text":"The original breakfast house is probably the best breakfast place in Phoenix. It is very reasonably priced and never leaves my family disappointed. The fried chicken and French toast is a must. Get the green chili side for your eggs and chicken. Juans tacos are an excellent choice if you are a fan of chorizo (which they overstuff the burrito with chorizo as well). Definite a must visit in North Scottsdale. Be wary though that there will be a long wait on Saturday and Sunday mornings."}
{"text":"Exceeded all expectations: food quality, menu, service, staff friendliness. Their breakfast specials - peach pancakes and a Cajun andouille scramble were fantastic. French toast was amazing. Even the hash browns were so good. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First time here. Excellent options for gluten free or restricted diet eaters. I had the special which was an asparagus goat cheese bacon egg plate of awesome. Substitued starches for cottage cheese and fresh sliced tomatoes. Everything was so fresh and fanominal. I even took home my iced tea in a to go cup. I never take my drinks home. My husband and I have found our new breakfast place. Thank you for the delicious breakfast and awesome service. Our waitress had such an infectious smile. You can tell it's a place that cares about its customers as much as its food. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Variety for specials is unique.  
The team that works here makes breakfast special.  Very clean and cool retro vibe. 
We have visited three other times and we will be back!  Mahalo"}
{"text":"This place was delicious! My daughter got the kids pancakes which I tasted and they were delicious. They were lemony tasting. The jelly for the toast was delicious as well. I'm so glad I didn't go to ihop like my daughter wanted to. This place is well priced and the service is both friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Was in the area for business and was looking for a brunch type restaurant and boy did I find it! Nothing fancy from the outside or inside but had people waiting to be seated so I thought this must be real good. First of all, this was the most courteous and prompt service I've gotten in a long time! Had the chicken fried chicken platter with eggs and french toast. FRESHLY squeezed orange juice plus 1 free refill. Everything tasted superb and super fresh. The yolk in my eggs were orange as opposed to yellow as they use eggs from free range chickens and other organic ingredients in their meals. The chicken was juicy and nicely seasoned. In fact, the breading was out of this world tasty and unique. Everything tasted home made and I rarely give 5 Star reviews on restaurants but this place really deserves it for everything I just mentioned plus the very low prices they offer. What a rare gem and I will go out of my way to eat here again!"}
{"text":"My husband, babies and I have become regulars to OBH. Love that we have something like this in north phoenix and don't have to travel to central phoenix to find something similar. I find the retro feel to the place refreshing and everyone on staff is always very nice. The wait can be long at times but that is because the food is great. I am a big fan of the chicken fried chicken (my 3 year old loves it too!) and I find myself waking up in the morning craving their fresh OJ and hint of lemon pancakes.  We have not been for lunch but will rave about breakfast always!"}
{"text":"Outstanding. Portions are huge. Most items are homemade including biscuits and jelly. We had a chile omelette (yes, chile is homemade) and home fries. Delicious! One of the best breakfast places in Phoenix for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! I love the food and the staff is always really friendly. It gets pretty crowded on the weekend, but totally worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Puts the bomb in bomb-diggity. The French toast was on point and the coffee was just as good. Homestyle cooking with upscale looking food and flavor!  Love this place so it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"I had the tuna melt and monday milkshake. Both were very good and I would recomend them to eat at."}
{"text":"Came two days in a row for breakfast. Food very good. French toast was awesome. Next day had the big gooey scramble. It was a monstrous portion!  I can EAT. I needed a box to take the HALF I didn't eat home. Ate it the next day for breakfast and it was still just a crazy amount of food.  Definitely making this a regular breakfast spot."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast spot in the 32 North corridor.  I bring all my out if town visitors here and try to introduce all my friends to this fantastic place as well.
     They are very busy on the weekends and you could wait 30-40 minutes for a table.  But once seated, you'll find the wait well worth it.  If You want to avoid the crowds - go for breakfast during the week.  No waiting.
    The food is better than most places you'll have breakfast.  While I can't call it gourmet - It's top shelf.  I'm pretty sure most everything is hand made.  Hand dippped vanilla French toast, lightly seasoned breakfast potatoes, and this to die for apple chicken sausage (I crave it when I've been away too long).  
   Service is always prompt, the food comes out quickly and it tastes divine.  You'll also see the owner here every day - seating people, asking for feedback and just making sure things run smoothly.  Its obvious that he cares and it shows in the staff as well.
   I've been here dozens of times and can't think of one bad thing to say - so I figured it was time to write a review."}
{"text":"Would recommend ! Our table was tightly spaced among many others and we had a floaty in our pitcher of water, but the service was great, food good, and all reasonably priced"}
{"text":"The food was good, but the coffee was amazing! I would go back. It was really crowded when we went and we had to wait about 20 minutes. Not sure if this is typical"}
{"text":"First time in. Had a really pleasant experience! Everyone was so nice! And the food was really yummy! Our server Seta was so sweet and we will be back just to see her :)"}
{"text":"The food is good, but they are now CASH ONLY and no longer take credit or debit cards (this is NOT noted on their website). There's usually a wait but it moves quickly."}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting from NM and were looking for a great local breakfast place. Original Breakfast House only accepts cash, but if you don't come prepared they have an ATM on site. The staff was friendly and seated us right away. I got the two eggs over medium and they were perfectly cooked. The bacon was crispy and their home fries were red potatoes and were ok, some of the pieces were very burnt and they needed more salt. My husband got the pancakes with raspberries and chocolate chips. The raspberries were fresh and the chocolate chips were semi-sweet. The pancakes themselves were plain (the berries and chocolate chips were just placed on top) and had lemon zest, which I usually like, but they were a touch too lemony. My husband and I both think that a sweeter chocolate chip would have been better. If you want real maple syrup they charge a $1 extra, and it comes in a pre-sealed little cup. Overall an ok breakfast, but we will not be returning when there are really great breakfast places in Scottsdale to eat."}
{"text":"Great place, great food and staff! Prices are reasonable for the amount receiving, orange juice is delicious !!"}
{"text":"Delicious!! Our breakfasts were very good! As I looked around to other tables it all looked good. I'm not even going to say what we got because seriously, you wouldn't go wrong with any choice. Too bad I'm from out of town. Fast service even though crowded. Good for kids, even busy rowdy ones."}
{"text":"I'm very picky about my pancakes. Ordered banana pecan pancakes... Out of this world!  These guys deliver every time I go. The OJ is squeezed while you are there!  Most fresh I have ever had. It's good food so it's busy. Never had to wait more than 15 minutes. The friendly hostesses and wait staff make the experience a happening. If you haven't been there...go. You'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"Experience was excellent. First time to original breakfast house. Large high quality portions. Friendly server. Very casual atmosphere and we happened to go before 8:30 am and were seated quickly. A bit pricey but you do get high quality and really large portions. Delicious French toast."}
{"text":"Visiting from LA and came here for breakfast with the family. Such a great experience all around. Food was fantastic. Prices were incredibly reasonable. Service was wonderful.  My kids ordered pancakes off the kids menu and our waitress informed us that they could add toppings similar to the adult menu pancakes for only $1 more. I had the chilaquiles and they were oh-so delicious. Order something with their green chile sauce. YUM!! Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Very good food! The parfait was huge; it was okay but the San Fran French toast (not pictured) was so yummy"}
{"text":"Had Popye omlet with home fries and banana nut pancakes with fresh orange juice.  It was superb."}
{"text":"My wonderful wife and I came for breakfast. She loves breakfast so we go out about once each weekend. We arrived about 1045am on Sunday and the place was Packed with a 45min wait. We waited and went to Safeway across the street to do some shopping. There is also a Walgreens. 

The staff that greeted us was very friendly even though it was busy. We ordered:

Breakfast sandwich 
Biscuits and gravy 
Strawberry French toast
Green chili side
Yogurt parfait 

Service was 5/5. Kimberly was so kind even though they were short staffed-- If you're are lucky you will get her to serve you. The food was good, I would order the breakfast sandwich (5/5) and yogurt parfait (5/5 ask for maple syrup for the parfait) again but would pass on the other dishes."}
{"text":"What a great breakfast/lunch restaurant, yelp was right with this one the food was fantastic and the service was also fantastic I'm very impressed next time I'm in Phoenix I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"My wife and I just tried this place out. The food was delicious. I had the breakfast sandwich and it was tasty. My wife had Juan's Tacos. They were chorizo and egg and they were delicious! I plan to go back and order her dish. Loved the fresh squeezed, pulpy OJ as well.

The only drawback was the service. Our waitress was terrible. Took our order and never came back. In fact someone else brought our food. I had to call out to get her to look at our table to get straws, napkins and refills after being ignored for twenty minutes. Granted it was Sunday morning and she was busy but she never glanced at the other tables when she came to her section. Passed my table 3 times and I wasn't able to waive her down that's how focused she was at ignoring her tables. I noticed her other tables having the same problem as well. Maybe as they are opened longer she'll get a better grasp on multi-tasking.

I'd give my experience 3.5 stars and round up because I think food is more important than service."}
{"text":"Great service was great and the food was good. It was my first time here, I enjoyed it. The OJ is also amazing. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Food is awesome! The cook their scrambled eggs perfectly, not like most places that overlook. They use real egg for the scrambled eggs, not liquid eggs like most places.  The French toast was great and the service was amazing. Definitely 5 stars.  Note they will be closed July 12 - July 21 for vacation."}
{"text":"BRING CASH. They do not accept credit cards.  There is an ATM in the front but doesn't do you any good if you dont have your card on you. We came straight from hiking and all we had was a CC. We live about 45 minutes away but thankfully could phone a friend who lived a little closer to loan us cash.  EMBARRASSING! 

The food was good. Typical diner breakfast options."}
{"text":"Hard to find good breakfast in Phoenix, but this place is great. Perfect atmosphere. Great food."}
{"text":"Even on a weekday, there was a bit of a wait -- but we made it in, and it was worth it.

Super friendly service, delicious breakfast options, and a surprise to see that coffee was on the menu not as \"coffee\" or \"drip coffee\", but as Cortez Coffee -- a Tempe, AZ based coffee roaster. Five stars for local businesses supporting other local businesses!

After perusing the menu, I opted for one of their specials -- a Triple-Berry Deep Fried \"San Francisco Style\" French Toast with a side of eggs, bacon, and the Cortez coffee. My brother-in-law was not joking when he said their French Toast was good ... it was beyond good. It was AMAZING.

I'm from the Bay, and I have never had French Toast like this. Why is it San Francisco style? Because they use sourdough bread, that's why!

If you happen to be in Phoenix, definitely stop here for breakfast. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Great food and great staff. The French Toast with bananas and pecans was delicious. Our server was a delight! Will be coming back to this awesome place for breakfast next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Local home-cooked family breakfast joint. Food is always good and service is great. My go to place for breakfast. The only downside is they don't have English muffins."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my fave breakfast spots! I had eggs with/goat cheese and asparagus side of hash browns-fresh blueberry/lemon compote topped pancake and cup of Cortez coffee. My husband had egg scramble/linguisa (the best linguisa I've had) & lightest yet yummy banana nut french toast. We don't live near PV but would definitely drive 40 mins for a great breakfast from here. We bought cinnamon roll & pop tart on the way out. The cinnamon roll was perfect warmed. The pop tart was ok the crust was thick for my liking and it had strawberry jam in the center. We chatted with our server about majority of the food. She was excellent, very knowledgeable of where the food came from (majority local). This is a busy place for a reason, be patient it's well worth it! **it's also now CASH only w/ATM in house. All around well thought and well done place."}
{"text":"Wow yummy delicious!!!

Coffee - impressive.  They even sell it!

Hot Chocolate with \"real whipped cream\" - mmm mmm good!

Brioche Cinnamon Bun with cream cheese icing - no words

Special: Ranchero Hash & Eggs - pleasantly surprised

Chicken Fried Steak - phenomenal!!! Gravy and their breading are the perfect combo.

Service (Daisy) was great - everyone has a smile on their face ... very friendly staff, customers.

Overall great experience!!!!

Definitely worth coming back!"}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast in Phoenix! 

Every visit has to start off with some freshly-squeezed OJ and a brioche cinnamon roll - no exceptions. Their french toast is to die for and the daily specials are always fantastic. Exceptional and friendly service too.

Trust me, there's a reason this place has a line-up out the door every weekend. Definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"So good!!! Oh my gosh the portions were huge and food was fantastic! I had the carnitas omelette, hubby had French toast, kids had pancakes and cinnamon rolls (huge and amazing!) Worth the wait. Everything was delicious! Services was also fantastic."}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped by yesterday for our first visit a little after 1:00 pm. We decided to check out this hot spot after seeing the overwhelming positive reviews on Yelp and after watching the video the owner made talking about their vision. 

The Positive: unlike some of the other reviews saying this place needs a face lift -I disagree and thought this place was very well thought out, clean and organized. It has a very warm and welcoming feel. 

The service.. Our server was Theresa... She was very attentive, and provided excellent service. Five Stars for  world class service go to her.

My wife got the huevos Ranchero -it was her first time ordering this and she said it was good no complaints. 

Now for the negative: I ordered two eggs not over easy but med asked for runny yolks with the whites cooked, bacon, hash browns with American cheese melted on top and a biscuit with a side of sourdough toast. 

Well no American cheese only cheddar and Jack -86 the browns I will do the Home Fry's. 
My eggs were hard fried-no gooey yoke for me to dip my biscuit in, the biscuit tasted dry and grainy, my bacon was very tough like jerky, and the toast was really hard to get through. 

Because we came at the end of the shift , we agreed maybe this was just a off moment, and we came in at a time when everyone was gearing up to go home. I get it, and because of that and because of the excellent service we received we will be back by to give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Awesomeness at the original breakfast house
As a self proclaimed French toast queen this fried French toast takes first place here in the valley. 

Not fancy at all. But clean. Fast. And good. If u don't like pulp in ur orange juice bring a strainer. It's pure and fresh juice. 

The Mr had Portuguese sausage with eggs and proclaimed it grilled and great. Not as spicey as could have been but fantastic just the same"}
{"text":"I had breakfast here today and this place is pretty cool. I hade the eggs Benedict and it was as expected! Very good, I would highly recommend it! This place is very popular so you have to get there early unless your going by yourself then you can just sit at the counter which was nice because I got to see them squeeze fresh oranges to make orange juice with. The staff is very friendly! The proportions are huge so you get your money's worth. I spend roughly $16.50 for eggs Benedict and a coffee but it was very well worth it. As I was walking out 12 News was coming in to do a morning special on the restaurant if that tells you how amazing it is. The only down side is that they only take cash so be prepared for that and they don't have a military/ law enforcement discount but the hostess said that on Veterans Day they do a free meal which is cool! If you forget to bring cash they have a no charge ATM right by the front door. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Best French toast in town, they use sour dough bread.  And there pancakes, amazing! Hint of lemon in the batter is so good.  They make their own strawberry jam which is so delicious.  The best part, they make fresh oj all morning so it's the first thing you smell as you walk in.  Great place for great food at a cheap price, family friendly."}
{"text":"We liked the atmosphere. The people were very nice. We enjoyed the the orange juice, the chorizo burrito, the el paso omelet and the oreo pancakes. We thought the biscuit and the hashbrowns were sub-par. Would definitely try it again. It sends liked they do some things really well while other things are lacking. Overall a good little place!"}
{"text":"Got the quinoa breakfast bowl. Was mainly cream of wheat with a tiny bit of quinoa (maybe 1/4 cup) mixed in with 5 berries. So around $6 for basically cream of wheat...have been coming here for years...will not be coming here anymore. Prices have gone up, now only take cash, and dip in quality.  No thank you."}
{"text":"I first heard of OBH from Groupon. I saw the groupons were sold out in one day, so I decided to go without the coupon. I've found a new favorite breakfast place. The omelets are so fluffy you have to butter them to the plate. They have raspberry chocolate chip pancakes that are out of this world. They actually have SOS for you veterans out there. The waitstaff is friendly and efficient. The place is clean with servers and bus persons flitting about constantly maintaining. Going on a Sunday? Get there before 8:30 AM or prepare for a wait. Don't miss this gem right off the 51[only going north] at thunderbird and 32nd."}
{"text":"This place is so popular they have a large covered waiting area with cold water.  Not worth the wait!  Myself with two out of towners waited over 30 minutes to be seated.  We were asked if we wanted to be seated at the counter and although for a single person it would be great, not so much for a party of 3.  There was a ton of activity behind the counter, it's busy I get it but because I was hoping to catch up with my visiting guests it was not very enjoyable at the counter.  We each ordered something different, chilaquiles, pancakes, and an omelet.  They served the chilaquiles with crispy chips, which I enjoyed, but the salsa verde lacked flavor, salt...something.   I found the omelet bland.  Now for the pancakes...I ordered the chocolate chips w/raspberries pancakes.  I was unimpressed that they did not fold in the chocolate chips in the batter.  They served a stack of pancakes with chocolate chips tossed on the top with raspberries.  It looked sloppy.  That right there killed it for me."}
{"text":"The absolute best breakfast house in Arizona we had the chipped beef fantastic pancakes are out of this world clean friendly tasty a must go to.  Thanks for great service"}
{"text":"Great place! Excellent service, breakfast was just okay for the prices. But, we will be back to try something else, burgers sounded good."}
{"text":"My pecan and banana french toast was amazing. My boyfriend had the chicken fried chicken which was just as good. We decided to try this place after a friend recommended it. We typically do breakfast out on Sundays and go to US Egg. This restaurant was much yummier than US Egg and much cheaper. I think we found a new Sunday breakfast lunch place!

We waited about 20 minutes for a table and it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great customer service. The hosts, and wait staff were very courteous and tentative. No complaints about the staff. I had the \"Cubano\" sandwich. Nothing to really impress, but this is a breakfast place.  I shared French toast with my wife. I should have gotten one for myself. Best French toast I've ever had!!! My wife had goat cheese, bacon, and asparagus omelet. She also wasn't impressed. My kids seemed to enjoy their pancakes, but what kid doesn't love pancakes. Great coffee!!!! The place sells their whole bean coffee by the pound as well."}
{"text":"Had the chicken fried chicken with two eggs and French toast. Fast service and food was delicious. The fresh squeezed orange juice is worth the visit. Friendly waitress and hostess :)"}
{"text":"I wanted to try a new breakfast joint and I googled this place and saw all the reviews and decided to try it and oh my goodness, I'm very happy that I did. Everything on the menu is $12 or less unless you're getting a prime rib steak, that's $14. It's affordable and most importantly it's DELICIOUS. I found my new fav breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! I lived near by for many years and recently tried this spot it is a hidden treasure! Must try! Will go regularly. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  Friendly staff.  Clean resturant.   You should try the fresh squeezed orange juice.  Adds a nice touch.  Menu is divided into Breakfast and lunch but I've yet to have a problem ordering the OBH burger at 9 am.  

Manager and his son are constantly roaming the floor,  clearing tables, and ensuring the meal was good.  Just the right amount of service.  Wait staff is consistent and happy to come to work.  :)"}
{"text":"I have kept my eye on this place wanting to try it for awhile. I recently moved a few blocks away and I was intrigued the minute I noticed it.
Welp..tried it...LOVED IT ! It has a home feel and the food is incredible.  One of the best breakfasts i have had on awhile. The French Toast is amazing and my sis loved her pancakes. 
You gotta try it. Home cooking...friendly,  professional staff and amazing food with a great ambiance too. What more do I need to say?"}
{"text":"I lived across the street for a full year prior to going. I stayed away because they have these childish life size square boxes with letters on them-- like the staking blocks that children play with. First impression gave me that this was not a place I wanted to eat at- and I have kids. I finally went because a friend told me about it. the food is amazing!!! the breakfast is amazing. I have yet to try anything else- banana French toast special is the best in the city. Nothing childish about this place- staff is amazing- homemade treats Cinnabon rolls and frosting - warm people- smiles all around.The food also speaks for itself. No childish blocks or decor on the inside. not clear why they have these displayed on the front lawn gives an impression you are attending a child play location. So in other words don't do what I did and judge it by the kiddo display boxes. my only advice would be to get rid of these boxes. No use- no relation to the theme of the restaurant - I don't understand why they are there to represent your wonderful restaurant."}
{"text":"We have become weekend regulars.  Almost know the menu by heart and look forward to specials that John or Nick come up with. 
My favorite breakfast is the Chicken Green tamales with eggs, black beans, warmed tortilla, salsa, guacamole & sour cream.  Hubby enjoys the Chicken Fried Steak, Biscuits &gravy.  
Lunch items are just as welcomed to enjoy, no such thing as small portions.  
Original Breakfast House is community minded, the Atmosphere is friendly, casual and the wait time always worth it."}
{"text":"Always love the consistency of this place, la Casa Potencia is my fav with whole wheat banana n strawberry cakes! Love the new decor!!"}
{"text":"Tried the restaurant for the first time today, and so happy I did. Took my mother there for lunch. I had the loaded BLT, and my mom had the tuna salad sandwich.  The portions were big and it was very tasty!  Inside it is was very clean, and had service with a smile!  Brought home some of their cinnamon rolls too. Will definitely be back again, but this time for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times and have enjoyed it each time. I prefer savory over a sweet breakfast any day. However, I get the best of both worlds here!  I usually order their chicken fried chicken with french toast. The chicken is very moist, and their french toast is super fluffy! I LOVE their gravy sauce. I ask for it on the side, so my chicken stays crispy and not soggy. I also get a side of hash brown just because. Servings are HUGE here, I always have left-overs. No complaints about this spot, I am def a fan though and will return when I am around the area. The servers I have encountered have been nice and food comes out timely! I will update once I try something new!"}
{"text":"Based on all the reviews on Yelp I had my hopes high. Overall it wasn't a bad place. I I liked the interior, the overall ambience and the service was excellent. The wait staff was very attentive and quick to respond to anything that we had requested. Just for the courtesy of the staff and the promptness I'll give it 5 stars.

The food was unfortunately not to my expectations. Perhaps I was over expecting based on all the previous reviews which I looked over as I was waiting to be seated. I had an omelet and the French toast and while the omelette wasn't bad it was nothing spectacular. I found the French toast to be exceedingly oily and that alone left with me not wanting to come back. The coffee we had was not bad, the orange juice was freshly squeezed and definitely delectable. Like everyone else is already mentioned the portions are generously sized and the prices are reasonable. 

For the food alone I would give it 3 stars but the overall experience and the exceptional service pushes it up to 4."}
{"text":"Came her for breakfast while on vacation. It was the best breakfast we have had. The cinnamon rolls are amazing, the pancakes are fantastic and the French toast was unbelievable. Great place for breakfast!"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite places to eat in all of Arizona.  Service is fantastic, food is fantastic, love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great service, quality ingredients including coffee which tends to slack at most breakfast places. Fresh orange juice. Enjoyed everything we ordered and for how busy they were the food was out to the table quickly & piping hot. There was one mishap which ruined a slice of sourdough french toast - salt in the sugar shaker!"}
{"text":"Wow this place gets crowded so keep that in mind. Upon looking at their menu, starting sept 1 they will only be accepting cash. That's weird. I never carry cash and probably won't want to withdraw money just to have breakfast. I had basic ham steak and scrambled eggs. You can't mess that up but the eggs were a bit dry. Coffee was good and service was excellent. You pay at the front. 

I returned here with a friend and got the chicken fried chicken covered in sexy white sausage gravy. It needed seasoning but it was good. I had to put some hot sauce on it. For some reason the eggs are really good, I got them medium. My friend got French toast and it was so good, I stole a piece of his!"}
{"text":"Food delicious. Fast and friendly service. The reputation certainly measures up. Portions are huge. We definitely had leftovers. The french toast was great."}
{"text":"My hubby and I tried OBH for the first time today after church and it was terrific. Hubby had the Chicken Fried Steak breakfast and the steak was great. Seasoned perfectly and the gravy was really good. Although my hubby said mine is better, he said it was good. My Strawberry French Toast was very good. The only complaint we might have was that it is very noisy, although in it's defense, it was packed. We definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Great food, fun atmosphere and a lot for what you pay for. Took half of it home and ate it the next day!"}
{"text":"OBH has been my best breakfast experience in the Phoenix area. The staff have been wonderful. The price is right. The food is amazing and reminds me of home. The orange juice is delish. I have never tasted French toast quite like these yummy gems.

The atmosphere is wonderfully casual and unique. The worst thing about this place is the ugly generic chairs. They just do not fit the style and vibe that I get from the rest of the joint. But the chairs are far from anything that could take me away from this tasty experience.

OBH is definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great environment and very affordable for the amount of food you get! It was busy for a Monday morning but well worth the wait and you can tell it's a favorite among regulars and locals so no wonder it was packed. Fair warning it is a cash only place but they have a very convenient ATM with NO FEES which was even better! Definitely recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Yum-O!  The French toast is to die for and the pancakes were unique and delish.  Chicken fried steak was amazing too.  The server was extra nice, food came quickly and price was right."}
{"text":"This place provides a wholesome breakfast/brunch with an even exceptional service!

I had a good time and it is worth every penny. 

Tips: $2 Milkshake all day every Monday!!

We were lucky to stop by on a Monday."}
{"text":"We went to OBH for 4th of July breakfast. We had a party of 7 so it took 15 or 20 minutes to seat us but the wait was well worth it. We had the Caprese omelet and the triple berry French toast. It was amazing. All the flavors worked well together. When we finished we asked our server Leah if we could get a carry-out. She started to get a container and we said, \"We need to have someone carry us out!\"  We were stuffed."}
{"text":"This has become my favorite breakfast place edging out Soul Cafe.  They have the freshest tasting eggs.  The owner is usually there to make sure everything is great.  The staff are all awesome as well.  Please note that they are cash only, but they have a no fee ATM for your convenience."}
{"text":"The staff was really good - and the food was great
Heads up to carry cash as they do not accept credit card payments"}
{"text":"The most important meal of the day.

As the old adage goes \"Breakfast is the most important meal of the day\". I have to admit, Breakfast is my favoite meal of the day. However,  Breakfast places have a tendency to be either hit or miss.

Today was my first visit to the Original Breakfast House (OBH) and it was a hit. OBH is cooking up breakfast right. OBH offers creative  unique entrée's and old time favorites, and you can substitute or add on to any entrée selection.

On my first visit I ordered scramble eggs, homestyle fried potatoes, and a side of pancakes, all were delicious. OBH even serves deep fried French toast which looked delicious, I plan on trying the french toast on my next visit . 

In addition to great food OBH has great customer servicr. OBH has an old diner feel with great music. The servers are friendly and seem really concerned that you enjoy your  meal and leave happy and full. 

So if your ever in the area, stop by OBH, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great coffee and the food was wonderful. Have the green chilli sauce it was really yummy. Would go back for sure!"}
{"text":"French toast. Did I mention the French toast?"}
{"text":"Deep fried French toast. Nothing more need be said.

Actually, this review was a little short for Yelp's taste so I must blab on for some reason.

Get the French toast. It is deep fried and they call it \"San Francisco style.\"

Again, deep fried French toast."}
{"text":"Very yummy!   We came here twice in our week stay in AZ. Coffee is wonderful.  French Toast and cinnamon rolls are delicious. Big gooey mess was fantastic. The sausage is amazing. Service was great!"}
{"text":"Probably our absolute favorite breakfast place. Consistently great food. The French toast is to die for. Family atmosphere and yummy food!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is located in a ghetto neighborhood  and so i was thinking \"oh no\" but as you walk in, someone greets you and takes you to a table right away.

Already theres a pitcher of water, cups, and the server asks if youd like some coffee. The restuarant has a very friendly and home-y feel. 

I ordered the pancake special which comes with a choice of sausage and/or bacon, 2 eggs, and 2 pancakes. Delicious!

My boyfriend ordered the green chilli omelette with carnitas. He said the spice sneaks up on you (in a good way) and was overall delicious. Though it might be a bit too much for your stomach in the morning! 

Would definitely come back. LOve this place!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here about 4 or 5 times. Always something different, as if I'm looking for a reason to stop liking the place or confirm that it was \"just that one plate they're good at making\". It doesn't matter what/when/how you order. The food is nothing short of fresh, and incredible (and usually natural/organic!). The prices are more than fair, the staff is unique, attentive and pleasant. Don't change a thing! Just add more locations and rid the world of the Denny's chain!"}
{"text":"This is one of the few times that a restaurant has met all my expectations. But this place takes the cake. The food was great and the service was even better. We decided to try this place out on our vacation. I had the Carnitas Omelette and it was BOMB! If you are in the Phoenix area, I suggest you try this place out."}
{"text":"Great food.  Large portions.  The chicken fried chicken with French toast is to die for!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh God!! This place is too crowded. Though it's far from the city, I drove all the way just to see almost 0 options on the menu (I'm a vegetarian..lol). Waited for 35mins on a Saturday morning.

Ordered -
California Benedict : asked for avacado instead of chicken. Did not taste that great. It was creamy and very bland. 

End of the day, it's over priced for meal portions you get and not good for vegetarians unless you wanna eat desserts / crepes. 
Sorry but not Sorry. I would rate this place 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Such a great find! I am gluten free so finding places with good options is hard. I had gluten free blueberry pancakes with bacon and it was delicious! Waitress was wonderful answering all my questions and service was quick. Boyfriend had french toast with eggs and bacon and he said that was awesome. Looked good for sure! All in all great and we will be back to try more things."}
{"text":"The owner's story of how he incorporated previous restaurants he owned and operated in Cal and Washington was pretty cool to see in a family breakfast joint such as this.  The building use to be an old Denny's so it has that classic dinner feel but the interior definitely is more Caly.  The menu states the importance of how all the food and ingredients are either organic or locally based, coffee included.  My wife was on a gluten-free diet at the time so having the wide variety of menu options made her happy, in fact the pancakes she had were the best (GF) she's ever had.  I stuck with one of their specialties, \"Chxn-fried-Chxn\" which came with a side of French Toast.  I would recommend getting a fresh topping on the French Toast, such as banana pecan, though it tastes good without as well.  The service was excellent even though it was busy. The owner was helping the staff in a variety of ways while keeping a smile, which is always a good thing to see.  The overall quality to portion ratio was excellent and the pricing was reasonable.  The coffee was so good I took some on the go.  The only thing it's lacking is a larger seating area, noticed families had to split booths among each other."}
{"text":"I was highly impressed by this place and thank you to fellow Yelpers for the highly recommended reviews! Immediately upon walking in we were greeted, seated and our Waitress (shoot I don't remember her name.), informed us of what she enjoys and it was very helpful for me since it's limited to what I can have for breakfast, since I don't eat pork.  I had their chilaquiles with a green chili sauce and eggs. Although, I liked it; I am so wishing I had Heath's deep fried french toast with triple berry!! Say what?!?! Deep fried french toast? Yes, you heard that right and that's what they served. I didn't believe it until it was in my mouth and I was like I should have ordered that! Trust me it wasn't easy getting him to share a bite. I'm like, \"seriously you aren't going to share?\" (Stink face - directed towards him in a playful way of course.) HAHA! But finally he shared and not just with me but with our other friends at the table! Shocking! ;)   Anyways, you MUST get this fabulous breakfast treat and they also have fretted squeezed orange juice. I believe the gentleman owner went around asking how everything was and I was impressed with that. This place is busy and from what I have heard it's new? I foresee this place being a success for a long time to come. It's a great sign when they are very busy with a lot of customers.

OBH is clean, cute, friendly, attentive and yummy. Our friends ordered the breakfast pork tacos and they very much enjoyed it.  A great touch is the entire coffee container that is left at your table for refills. 

 I'm saying goodbye to the breakfast joint at 40th Street and hello OBH since dining here. :)"}
{"text":"My SO and I have been here twice now, great experience both times. 
On the first visit, he had the Lingucia & Cheddar plate with French toast & and I had the chicken mole tamale special. Our meal was complimented by coffee and OJ.
The tamale was amazing; perfectly moist with a good balance of chicken to filling. The accompanying eggs and rice were also cooked to perfection. Scratch tortillas and black beans were a nice balance to the dark, rich flavors of the mole. Very delicious all around. 
The SO says the Lingucia? (Portuguese) sausage was well seasoned and yummy, while I can confirm the chewy outside and soft custard-like inside of the French toast was insanely amazing. 
My only criticism is really a personal preference, too much pulp in the OJ for me, the SO had the scrape a lot of it out so I could drink it. 

The second visit was also awesome. The SO got the french toast with bacon and I got Juan's tacos, a lemon scone and a short stack of pancakes (yes, little girls can eat, too). 
The chorizo and eggs in the taco were nicely seasoned and cooked.  Sides of guacamole, pico and black beans went well with the tacos and freshly made tortilla. The pancakes have just a hint of lemon, creating a nice flavor profile in your mouth. I thought the scone was a bit dry, but tasted great dunked in my coffee. 
Both trips were on weekends. Both times we did wait, but it wasn't more than 10 minutes either time. Not too bad at all. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast and were very impressed. Fresh ingredients and a very unique twist on traditional favorites. My husband had the spam and eggs and I had an omelette. They do all omelettes with egg whites by request. Fresh squeezed juice, friendly staff and home baked goods. A+ all the way!"}
{"text":"This was a Yelp! find, searching for breakfast after going to farmers market, Decided to come here when i read the reviews that they had such high marks and that they have many gluten free options.
Were sitting here not knowing anything about Alice Cooper owning the plaza, i said to our server...Who's the Alice Cooper fan? That's when i found out about him owning the whole plaza and thrift store (i'm a freak about thrift stores).
I was interested in the gf banana pancakes and that is what i had, it was  delicious, all the flavor was there but they were more like a crepe because how thin they were, no complaint regarding that, just mentioning it.
Great service, really good coffee with non-dairy flavored creamer (a bonus). Freshly squeezed orange juice. 
Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Oh my home away from home! Can I move in? Cash only now and I say good for them! Plus they offer a free ATM, which they didn't have to do. I get the same breakfast wherever I go- scrambled eggs with hash browns and toast- and I must say without a doubt they do it best! The French toast is insane and the pancakes taste homemade but wayyy better! The staff is insanely friendly and love that the owner is always there and very hands on!"}
{"text":"This was a fantastic restaurant. There were 5 of us, all ordered different breakfast items, shared them all and every one was delicious. The brioche cinnamon roll was the perfect ending!"}
{"text":"OMG!  This place is outstanding!  Our waitress was truly proud to work in this family-established restaurant!  The food was ridiculous!  Crispy hash browns, fluffy eggs, fresh squeezed OJ, funnel-cake like French toast and crispy chicken-fried chicken.  Organic, locally sourced...but for me it's all about the taste buds!  Lots of flavor with only a touch of heat!  The owner asked how our meal was...the best breakfast I can remember!"}
{"text":"What can I say, we go every weelemd! the service is beyond outstanding, each and every server is friendly and cannot wait to meet your every need. They know us now and even remember our favorites! To hear the specials of the day is like a dream, they tell you with enthusiam and detail each and every dish!  the food is always fresh and visually pleasing. Servings are MORE than enough...  John is there to greet you, and my husband and I are always amazed, his staff never has a bad day, even when the line is out the door! They always ask about a to go cup! each refill comes in a clean glass!When we moved here in 2014 we were told, you should try this place.... cannot say enough, as I just went to a high end \"Restaurant Week\" place, spent 5 times as much, no friendly service, good/predictable food... maybe it is time to go back to the small community restaurants....  I am a lifer..."}
{"text":"Somehow I had not heard about this place until a Yelp search this weekend.

We arrived a little before 11 and there were a few parties ahead of us.
Plenty of parking, friendly service, and we were seated in like 10 minutes.

We got the best seat in the house, a booth by the Northwest corner : )
Our server was very nice, friendly and accommodating to our special requests.

They seem to serve organic and local produce, cage free eggs, freshly squeezed juice, and, all this at very affordable (competitive) prices.

I had the special, pork chops and eggs.
Hubby had one of the omelettes with a substitution to try the Brazilian sausage (Linguiça)

We also tried the hush browns and the house potatoes, both were good but next we will probably order the home ones.

We ordered our regular extra crispy side of bacon, and when it first arrived it was not very crispy, so they took it back and then it was a little too tough (oops)... maybe because it is slightly thicker than the regular you get at some other breakfast places.

The food choices I thought were reasonable priced, bacon I thought it was a little pricey $3.95 for 3 slices, and coffee and soft drinks I believe are $2.50.

Multi-grain toast was good, and it comes with a small container with strawberry jam, feels like home made : )
Hubby got a biscuit and it was kind of tough, but as soon as we brought it to the attention of our server it was promptly replaced.

I do not expect everything to be perfect, but rather we pay attention to how things are handled when something goes wrong.
Also, service industry is a lot about attitude and everyone here seemed to be very happy and positive.  : ) We are glad we found them!"}
{"text":"The banana pecan French toast was pretty solid.  Banana crunch oatmeal was good.  Bacon and sausage was solid.  The new smoothie they offer, or at least the one I had with pineapple in it,  was great.  Great service as well.  Want to go back and try the banana pecan pancakes since that seems to be a popular item."}
{"text":"I love this place. First thing I always get at a breakfast restaurant is coffee And orange juice which is fresh, recently just squeezed! Amazing and I'm gonna tell you something I'm not a big fan of eggs but when I come here I eat them with out hesitation because it's so delicious. Service is outstanding they really make you feel like your at home like \"part of the family\". Thank you OBH keep it up"}
{"text":"This place was decent. A little ghetto with a giant atm in the center of the lobby. Food was good. Service was excellent. They only accept cash which is completely weird. Don't know if I will be back or not."}
{"text":"The real deal. 
Best breakfast in the Valley! 
Big portions, solid pricing, friendly staff, cute place, clean, fresh squeezed orange juice, fresh pastries. 
Just, legit. 
Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting a great breakfast, but I got one! 1 and a 1/2 actually because I ate the rest of wifey's as well.

The food is much better quality than you would think based on appearances. Its a little dive like but that's where the gems are usually hidden!

We will be back, soon!!!"}
{"text":"A great addition to me meager selection of breakfast places here in Phoenix.  This could become my favorite place for breakfast.  The fact that California Pepper Sauce is on the table instead of the usual suspects is icing on the cake for me.
Eggs taste great and I assume are organic.  I've enjoyed (from several visits):
Poached eggs and omelets: eggs respectfully cooked and to my liking.
Pancakes: great batter recipe and NOT over beaten.  Light and fluffy.
French Toast:  they deep fry - and I have to say that they are good.
Toast:  Sourdough toast was thick and excellent.  Not from grocery or Costco.
Service was great and staff was friendly.
A Few things maybe they could consider for rock star status:
1. Plating and presentation can be better.  
2. offer a natural and/or organic syrup.  Having the High Fructose Corn Syrup alone NOT a great thing.
3.  offer a ketchup that isn't full of High Fructose Corn Syrup and/or Corn oil.  Lots of brands out there that are a better choice.
4.  need more fruits and veggies."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday morning really expecting a spectacular breakfast based on the reviews. We were somewhat disappointed. This is a diner type place which we were aware of but too unhealthy for our liking. My friend got an omelette with hash browns and English muffin. I got the egg white spinach with potatoes and multi grain bread. My husbands breakfast was fine but over buttered which was similar to my dish. All the right ingredients were there but the dish was just too buttery to Bare. My favorite part was the multi grain bread which had no butter and was toasted perfectly. There was strawberry jam to go with it but that was just ok. The service was good though and very friendly. Just remember to bring cash

Bottom line...if you are looking for a diner meets Paula deen breakfast then this is the place. If you are looking for a good but somewhat healthy breakfast then try somewhere else. 

Pros
Friendly service 
Wide range of breakfast options 
Good quality food 

Cons 
Too buttery 
Strawberry jam is too sugary 
You must pay cash here 
This restaurant isn't in the great part of town"}
{"text":"I recommend the restaurant and I had Five Egg Whites Scramble. I asked for regular eggs, however.  It was delicious.

I asked Elen for something good for my figure.  The dish had spinach, mushrooms, onions and cheese.  The fruit bowl had strawberries, melon and grapes.  The cottage cheese was good too.

I will come back again and recommend it to friends.

Elen was friendly, helpful and fast.

My total bill was $13 including coke and tax."}
{"text":"Had the BlackBerry French toast with eggs. Was delish. Berries were fresh and sweet. Big portions. Will definitely be back.  Get there early, it's busy!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast joint . Friendly, welcoming staff and great food you don't have to wait too long for . It's a cash only place but they have a no fee atm on location . The OJ is also freshly squeezed per order ."}
{"text":"I felt like I stepped into an alternate dimension. 1960's music was playing, the staff wore tie dye shirts. The prices were super reasonable! Reminded me of Sunday morning breakfast with my grandparents when I was a child. Great food and great atmosphere. Hands down, favorite breakfast place in the valley of the sun!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast spots.  Drove across town 7 months pregnant with a 2 year old in tow after mowing the lawn (in Arizona, in 95' weather).... ravenous.  

Too bad I didn't get the memo about cash only.... and apparently OBH didn't get the memo about it being 2017.  I checked both yelp and Facebook and did NOT see this information prominently listed.  OBH you're not doing a good job about spreading the word and frankly I think being cash only is outrageous."}
{"text":"I thought Original Breakfast House was A-OK. Service was nice and my huevos rancheros my were tasty. One of the things I liked best was the great selection of Mexican-themed breakfasts. Like Chorizo and Tortilla Buritto and another with Chilaquiles. Lots of pepper sauces to choose from as well!

Breakfast and coffee for one, with tip = $20."}
{"text":"We arrived at noon and they said it would be a fifteen minute wait. That was reasonable. However, we were seated in about 5 minutes. It actually took us longer to decide what to order than to be seated and get our food. The food was delicious and we loved the service and climate. Open one of these in Clovis, NM!"}
{"text":"Very busy restaurant and they are on top of their game with friendly customer service. Worth the wait for awesome tasty food!  Don't forget it's a cash only restaurant. ATM is right there for the convenience with no fee!"}
{"text":"The portions are big. The food is fresh, organic, local, and delicious. They have simple options, and some different ones like the chorizo omelette. Fresh squeezed orange juice was awesome"}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast (and coffee!) in Phoenix. Staff is always friendly. Food is so fresh I have never tasted anything like it. Great family atmosphere and very relaxing. Can't recommend this place enough!"}
{"text":"This is a great basic breakfast joint. We had the pancakes, egg white scramble, and regular old bacon and eggs. It was all good and pretty tasty."}
{"text":"I love their organic selection and excellent service! They had great coffee and tasty specials. Paying cash is not a problem!"}
{"text":"Everything here is kicked up a notch if you're used to those franchised diners.

The scrambled eggs are buttery and soft... the food is seasoned... the jam that comes with bread is scratch-made...  the hashbrowns were probably just cut that morning!

The orange juice is definitely fresh and really a refreshing difference from the tart grocery store sort.

We had steak and chicken fried steak. The steak was actually slightly pink and tender! gasp. The chicken fried steak batter was really good and non-greasy.

The food descriptions aren't new and you've probably seen the exact same offerings at other places but it is done BETTER here. More fresh.. better cooked... more cared for.

The only thing I didnt enjoy was my side of fruit. It looked sad."}
{"text":"The OBH is nothing short of amazing from cover to cover. The service is great, the staff is friendly, the owner \"John\" bops around to your table. The atmosphere has got a nice retro feel, but clean and easy on the eyes. The food is outstanding. I have eaten here many times and I have yet to be disappointed. I love that everything is locally grown, fresh and John and his crew do it all from scratch! Saturdays and Sundays this place is hopping, a little less crowded during the week. Check it out, it is worth a little drive!"}
{"text":"Definitely NOT worth the 1 hour wait, 2 meals biscuit and gravy + chicken fried steak and eggs Ha! The entire meal was cold, the gravy was stale and the \"eggs\" LOL were something like \"eggs\" but certainly not \"eggs.\" Worst breakfast I've ever had hands down, Denny's would've been a step or even two steps up from this place. You'd think that a $40 breakfast for 2 would yeild something worth writing home about, and as you can see that's one thing they did get right. Don't waste your time or money, not sure how they made the PHX Top 10 but if the other 9 are anything like this place Im calling Bullshit and demanding a recount. C-ya"}
{"text":"I had the ham & eggs with pancakes & hash browns.  The food is good, but the 4.5 stars is not an accurate rating for here.  The other 4.5 rating places I have dined at were incredible.  This was just a decent breakfast ."}
{"text":"Based on all of the positive reviews we went to the Original Breakfast House yesterday for breakfast.  We expected to wait for a table and indeed there was about a 25 minute wait.  But, aside from that, it was really a delightful experience.  Aside from the food, which was really good, the service and attitude of the wait staff was wonderful!  Every single person with whom we spoke had a smile on their face, was very polite, accommodating and professional - very surprising for a lower priced, family style restaurant.  Our server, Divina, was exceptional!  She was prompt, attentive, friendly....  simply a delight!  I hope the owners of this restaurant realize how fortunate they are to have employees such as this! 

As far as the food - we each ordered a Morning Glory muffin (a carrot cake like muffin with raisins and nuts) which was served warm and was absolutely to die for!  My husband ordered the El Paso Omelette with hash browns while I ordered the Chicken Apple Sausage Scramble with fruit.  We both loved our choices.  

I can't believe I have lived in the area for 14 years and am just now learning about this place.  It will, no doubt, be one of our regular breakfast spots from now on!"}
{"text":"Great place,great people! I would highly recommend this to anyone! I had the French Toast it was superb,two High fives!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Juice is sooo good and fresh. Only downside is the very long wait on weekends"}
{"text":"\"SETA\" was an excellent server. Very attentive and great personality. Our food came out super fast. Chorizo burrito was AMAZING. Best I ever had. Love this place! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Zucchini frittata was so good. Also had French toast. Portions are big could have easily shared it."}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood, so we come here all the time. The trick is to come before 8am on the weekend to avoid the wait. 
Our favorite is the minced ham ans scrambled eggs. The seasonal lemon curd pancakes are to die for. Lunch is very good too. Sometimes I'll have a burger or  something else off the lunch menu for breakfast. There are basic American dishes to suite those with a simple palate and plenty of sophisticated dishes for the foodies out there. Service is always fast, the food piping hot, and the owner is always there making sure everyone is satisfied. We love OBH."}
{"text":"My first time visiting Phoenix, Went here after seeing all the great reviews and it did not disappoint! Reasonable priced with a unique menu and a lot of variety. The service was wonderful from the time we walked in until we left. So friendly and personable and helpful! The food came quick and was very flavorful and filling. The pancakes looked small and basic but pack a flavor punch. Soft and melt in your mouth with a hint of lemon, so good! I had an asparagus, bacon and goat cheese scramble, it was fantastic. My bf has the filet, tender and well seasoned! They only take cash for payment but offer a fee free atm so we were fine with that! I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a delicious affordable breakfast with great service!!!!!"}
{"text":"While visiting family in AZ and staying at a resort nearby, we decided to venture out for breakfast in compliments of Yelp reviews. We found this gem......
This has to be the best breakfast place I've been to- hands down! 
Service was pretty awesome, the coffee was a great start, the fresh squeezed OJ was right on. 
Place was busy the entire time, and all the dishes we had were delicious. 
Great QUALITY food, great prices, great service. 
Definitely coming here on our next AZ trip."}
{"text":"Super great little diner! Not the most delicious breakfast I've ever had, it's diner food, but definitely up there. The most amazing parts about this place aren't even the food! It's the awesome wait staff, the crazy unbelievable orange juice, the cheap prices, and the kindness and caring they show to my twin toddlers (toddlers in restaurants make most restaurants and wait staff cringe a bit, but these guys even have a little bookshelf with kids toys and books!). We live just up the road and go regularly and always feel welcome!"}
{"text":"A very good breakfast!  The service was quick and extremely pleasant.  We went in on a Sunday at 8 and only waited 5 minutes before they found us a table.  I ordered just a basic breakfast but out was the best basic breakfast I've had in a while.  The pancakes have a hint of lemon zest that makes them taste so luscious.  The home style potatoes were seasoned to perfection.  The service was so pleasant as well, would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is really nice, fast service, and food is good. The only thing that I can't stand is how dirty the staffs clothing is. It comes off as sloppy and unprofessional,  I understand they are working with food but the amount of stains and food on ALL the staffs clothing was ridiculous. Uniforms or unity in what they wear and being neat would help with the presentation of the restaurant"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood of this restaurant and have been avoiding in due to a string of bad restaurants in place before it.  Additionally, the outside looks like a regular 'ol diner.  I was mistaken!  It's cute inside, almost modern décor with enough 'diner' feel to know you should order breakfast.

On a Saturday morning, my boyf and I strolled in for some eggs and bacon.  It was busy, but we only waited about five minutes.  I ordered an omelette with spinach, bacon and mushroom- it was HUGE and stuffed with ingredients, not just all eggs and a few bits of spinach- I was impressed.  I could only eat half and took the rest home for yummies later.  It came with whole wheat toast (ya! for another option besides 'white') and they have local jam that was super delish!

My boyf ordered the French toast, which gets a lot of attention.  It's lightly fried, and he could not have been happier, as it also came with bacon and two eggs!  I tried the French toast, quite different from your usual soggy bread French toast with great flavor.

Price was reasonable.  Service was attentive and fast.

We will be back and definitely want to try the lunch menu, too!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely the best!!! There may be a long wait but it IS DEFINITELY worth it! The staff is always  friendly and the portions are big! The French toast is always to die for!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Home fries ( chopped potatoes) sooo good. Have to be crispy though.. They make the best poached eggs, and they are cage free :)  They have the best jam I have ever tasted.. Its locally sourced without high fructose corn syrup and GMO bullsheet.  Great service as well, everyone is sooo sweet from the host to the servers."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast during work and I loved it!! I think this May be family Owned which is always a plus! I love to support local businesses instead of billion dollar corporations. I got the raspberry chocolate chip pancakes which were amazing!!i should have took a pic as the presentation was also great! The servers were nice and very fast. Next time I want to try the cinnamon roll(looks like a Cinnabon but better) that you can substitute instead of toast for a dollar! Will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Our second visit to the OBH and once again it was outstanding. We got greeted and seated right before the rush. The tables already have a carafe of water with glasses and coffee cups waiting.  Our waitresses came over quickly and took our order.  Food was delivered surprisingly quickly considering the restaurant was packed.  My Popeye omelet was perfect and the accompanying pancakes had a wonderful lemony flavor to them. The entire staff of waitresses/waiters, busy boys functioned as a well oiled machine.  Even the owner was visiting customers tables.  They do get busy so be prepared to wait during prime times."}
{"text":"French Toast outstanding! Blueberry lemon pancake just right, raspberry chocolate chip pancake very sweet. Good coffee. A little noisy due to acoustics. Busy on Saturday morning."}
{"text":"The prices are very reasonable and the goods is excellent! I would definitely cine again! Try the San Francisco Style French Toast! The omelets are light and fluffy and the service staff is very attentive."}
{"text":"Stick to your ribs breakfast foid. Always busy and always solid. I usually need a nap after this place! Portions are large. Service is friendly and the food is great."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, They are very welcoming and attentive. The food here looks amazing and the premises are clean."}
{"text":"This place is a miraculous take on the family dining experience. My family usually picks this spot above all others due to the generous accommodations, consistently great food, and incredible customer service! I have never been disappointed going here, and I see the love and attention to detail rarely seen in most breakfast joints in the city. The waitresses greet you with familiar and warm smiles. The atmosphere is always jostling and lively with conversation and the enticing smells of their specials ranging anywhere between their unique take on dishes close to my heart: Spam and Rice to the San Francisco style French Toast, watering my mouth as I recall my experiences with the taste of Apple Chicken Sausage on the tip of my tongue. Service is on point. Even if the wait on the weekends is 30-40 minues, it's due to the high quality of the food and the anticipation to get in and be seated! 

Once you're seated, the menu fits comfortably in your hands. Dishes are prepared very well with a downhome feeling to them with someone always there to ask if you need anything. On the weekdays, it's a little quiet but well worth cultivating the oftentimes relaxing experience with the food in a subdued, yet welcoming restaurant--a kind of openness and hospitality similar to island - style eateries with a California beach twist. A trademark the owner makes sure to indulge. He is always there as a reassuring presence, constantly keeping a vigilant yet efficacious eye on the counters and kitchens, checking with clientele, following up on his employees and flood of patrons with a beaming smile. Every time, he never fails to amaze me in the best way.

Quite frankly, to me, this place bubbles up feelings of welcome no matter how I come into my state of mind for that day: sad, happy, angry, the day gets brighter when I'm here--it's home. That feeling never changes when I come here, or when my family comes here. And they have noticed this, too. I'm so grateful to this place, and I wish them to thrive and blossom so we can savor more memories from one generation to the next!!"}
{"text":"What a great find!  The reviews were spot-on! Portions are generous, service very friendly, line-ups are not long and the waiting area is comfortable, and the food is terrific. We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"I love their French toast, but at first I didn't. Because it is deep fried I was expecting it to be crispier. But now I've come to love it and I can't stop by without at least getting a slice. Their omelettes are also very good. I don't think you can go wrong with any of them. You can tell that they use fresh ingredients. They get pretty busy, especially weekends, but they do a very good job making your food quick so that the wait is as short as possible. They might be my favorite breakfast spot in Phoenix. There are places whose pancakes I Iike more(not a shot at their pancakes, they are very good) and there's probably places whose hash browns I like more, but as a whole this is my favorite breakfast spot. I have enjoyed everything on their menu that I've tried and I hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"If there's any way I could give this place 10 stars I would!!!! Just completely AMAZING! Don't let the crowd outside for the wait detour you from eating here, they get people in so fast we had just a 20 minute wait. And I must say, it was WELL WORTH THE WAIT! 
We were greeted by the welcoming owner,  super nice guy. You can tell he really cares  that each and every customer has a great experience. I saw him go from table to table checking on his customers to just say hello and to make sure they were enjoying the food. 
Our waitress Brittany was outstanding! Very knowledgeable about the menu, friendly, and on top of things! 
Now to the food.....  OMG!!! I have to say, this by far is the best breakfast I have ever had! We ordered the chicken fried chicken with banana pecan French toast, and biscuits and gravy. The chicken is cooked to perfection with a tender juicy breast and delicious crispy crust. Don't skip out on the gravy, it is absolutely delicious! The biscuits are large, buttery and flakey, homemade gravy and sausage that is out of this world!!! The fresh squeezed OJ is so good! You even get 1 free refill, unheard of! 
The French toast is to die for! It tastes like bananas foster, make sure to get the Vermont maple syrup, totally awesome! 2 pieces of toast will take up your entire plate! I can't say enough about how delicious this place is!
The prices are very reasonable and the portions are huge! We would have easily and happily paid twice what we did for this breakfast, it is THAT good! 
They keep it very clean and what a great atmosphere! The place is a buzz with friendly conversation and laughter. 
When you eat good food you're happy and my husband and I left here VERY happy. We will come back here any chance we get. It will be one of our \"must haves\" anytime we're in town!"}
{"text":"Emily, our server is a certifiable professional, grade-A cutie and a top-notch server. She started our meal with a smile and kept them coming. 

I'm a huge fan of all things chorizo. I have zero qualms with talking about this. There's a reason, it's because it's delicious. There are several options for all the chorizo lovers out there (there are more of me right?). The key is to try and spread out your appetite so you can finish your meal. I failed bad on this. 

Started with the brioche cinnamon roll. Do that. It was Devine. Followed with the El Paso omelet and it was met with a \"whoa\" from me. Emily, ever the perfect server mentioned this is not an uncommon reaction to this monster. It was awesome and tasty and huge. 

This place was a random Yelp find for us and it was amazing."}
{"text":"Long wait for nothing special. Really busy and loud and food mediocre. The gravy on the biscuits and gravy platter tasted straight up weird...almost sweet, maybe it was the sausage they used and the biscuits were too doughy and not quite cooked long enough. The oatmeal came with bananas, pecans, milk, raisins, and brown sugar...it was ok but served kind of like warm so the brown sugar wouldn't melt completely. There was plenty of water and the server was friendly enough and relatively prompt. Still...better places in the area for breakfast."}
{"text":"I have now been here twice since I moved up from Tucson. The staff here is always warm and inviting; and the food is fantastic! The carnitas with green chili is amazing and the best this side of New Mexico!"}
{"text":"Food, prices and service are all great. For us it is REALLY close to home. Only complaint is that it is loud, loud, loud."}
{"text":"Delicious. It was worth the 45 minute wait for a table. As my friend said I would've waited an hour and a half for that. The Popeye omelette was unbelievable."}
{"text":"I tried this place and it was pretty good. My gauge of a good breakfast place is always the biscuits and gravy. I was a little disappointed in the gravy. Sausage was scarce in my gravy portion and the flavor was bland. Didn't taste much like sausage or anything but milk. Overall the rest of the breakfast was good. 

Work on the gravy, salt, fattier more flavorful sausage and some pepper, lots of pepper.....you may be on to something!
The biscuit was worthy for sure!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING, been an OBH fan since the beginning and they never disappoint. The food is always fresh and the staff is one of the most friendly staff I've ever met. Whenever we have family in town we always bring them here and they fall in love with the food as well. John sure knows how to run a restaurant and even on busy days once you are seated the food doesn't take long to come out. French toast is by far one of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Came here Sunday, to do a family breakfast, since my future brother in law was in town with his wife. Breakfast was at 8:30am, we got there around 8:15am, table for 7 adults and 2 kids please! Gentleman told us it would be a 15 to 20 minute wait, about 35 to 40 minutes later I can see and hear the lady up front tell the gentleman that gave us the estimated time she was going to talk to 'Kathy' about the wait; never talked to me. After we finally got seated, my BIL came inside from being outside in the cold, and  surprised everyone. 
I ordered the big ooey gooey mess or whatever it was called and it was alright, I expected more sausage, but maybe it was covered by the large amount of home fries. I loved the amount of cheese in it though! But that's about it, my pancakes were fluffy as well, so that's a plus. Boyfriend got the San Francisco style pecan and banana French toast I believe, and he hated it. The texture was way too chewy for him, and everyone else at the table who tried it. I boxed up my left overs and gave it to my dog, I didn't want to waste my food, my boyfriend left his. Our server was nice and decently attentive though, wasn't too bad of an experience but also wasn't memorable.

As for the other 5 entrees the rest of the table ordered, only one of them decided to take the other half of their sandwich home and the rest didn't finish their breakfast either. BIL said his hash browns were really soggy and not crisp and seemed like they've been sitting there for a while, and commented as to how this place had 4.5 stars and such great reviews. 

Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be driving from Gilbert to here again."}
{"text":"Pretty clean. 

Good food. 

Definitely not a one $ place. More like two $$. Pancakes and French toast plus juice for 3 kids and 2 adults was over $55."}
{"text":"Having the Reindeer scramble to bring in the holidays spirit. So far every visit has been wonderful, especially there chicken fried steak and gravy.... Servers and owners are wonderful pleasant people. We come here every Friday."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a breakfast/lunch place that is cheap but with delicious food and a lot of variety, this place is it! It does get pretty busy on Sunday mornings but it's worth the wait. Service is good- food is good- price is good. What more could you want?!"}
{"text":"I ate here last Sunday with my family.  I was happy to see that a new place has opened in place of Gino's that moved (closed) about two years ago.  Many places have frequented this location, but this one by far is the best.

The restaurant is clean and well managed.  The wait staff is friendly and makes the dining experience that much better.....

I had the steak and eggs to celebrate my birthday.  It was quite a treat for $10.00.  In addition, I was able to sample the pancakes and hash browns.  Everything tastes great and is made with the finest ingredients.  In addition, the food arrive warm and in under 20 minutes.

The one thing that I especially enjoyed was the option to include real maple syrup (not the heavily processed stuff in a plastic bottle) for $1.00 more.  That in itself made the breakfast memorable.

The prices are extremely reasonable. 

If you are looking for a breakfast destination in Phoenix, look no further."}
{"text":"The place for breakfast if you live in North Phoenix.  The green chili omelette is really good if you are a green chili lover.  Their \"Big Gooey\" is their version of a scramble and will fill you up and then some.  The Juan's Tacos are also really good.  Bottom line? We have never ordered anything that we didn't think was really good in here.  The staff are super friendly and will take care of you.  So what are you still reading here for?  Go get some great breakfast!"}
{"text":"We went here on a Sunday based on the reviews. We were not disappointed. The wait was about 20 minutes. The food was excellent. The service was pleasant and helpful. I had the chicken and waffles; it was better than advertised. All of us enjoyed our meals."}
{"text":"Fantastic! The omelet I had was full of flavor! Cooked perfectly too! The original waffles were also amazing! Cash only so bring $$$"}
{"text":"Fan-f**ing-tastic! The food was great and the service was spectacular. I won't bore you worth the details of our order, but I will say that we enjoyed our meals. The only thing I'll write that's close to a complaint was about my pancakes. 

They charge an extra $1 for strawberry topping, but when the plate arrived, there were only about three [strawberries] on the plate. A nice gentlemen (the owner maybe?) ended up getting me almost a bowl full to make up for it. Kudos to him. Oh!! Also be prepared for a little bit of a wait. Took about 20 mins, but it was worth the wait. 

Bonus 10 points: Our waitress chased us out to the parking lot when she discovered an item was missing from our extra to-go order was missing. 

Bonus 5 points: All the other patrons were really nice folks. This was definitely a \"family friendly\" atmosphere."}
{"text":"Having been informed some time ago by the owner that they had reworked their gravy recipe and asking me to give it another try, I reluctantly made my way back in.  I have to say that I was impressed with the food. They gravy was very good and the biscuits now taste homemade. The service was slow but, at the same time, very friendly. I will definitely be back again.  They have changed my mind about this place."}
{"text":"Food was tasty - we had pancakes and \"The Big Gooey Scramble Mess.\"  Pancakes were good, nothing special.  Bacon was fabulous.   The Gooey Scramble was great - except for the onions.  They were raw and crunchy and were the only negative.  Our scramble was HUGE!  Homefries, sausage, cheese, eggs (we substituted egg whites) - all mixed up into a pile of yumminess!  Mushrooms were also included but we requested them to be removed (order was correct).  Fix the raw onions and I'll change to five stars!  :)  Fresh squeezed oj was yummy but take note that is pulpy.   Super friendly service. speedy order delivery, fair prices.  We're neighbors with this place and will be back."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!!  With such a high review score maintained after 900+ reviews, you MUST know this place is doing something right!  Let me start off by saying that the french toast is THE BEST!!  Everything else is also great, but my number one choice is the french toast...  until today!  My family took me there for Father's Day, and even at 7:05a there was a huge crowd waiting to be seated.  Even if the hostess had said there was a one hour wait (which there wasn't) I would have waited.  This food is that good!  This morning I had the Cinnamon Roll Pancakes...  yummy!  They weren't a normal menu item, so I guess it won't be my new favorite.  Haha!  Just remember, if you want good food, you need to get there early, don't be in a hurry, and when it's your turn to sit, enjoy yourself!"}
{"text":"The wife and I have had nothing but great experiences here. The chicken fried chicken is their specialty and they do it well. The French toast is also a favorite and I'm not typically much of a fan. Fresh squeezed OJ and some unique menu items are among some other reasons to keep coming back."}
{"text":"Awsome food and lots of it. Plus best OJ ever. We both had breakfast. Wonderful Arizona centrics deliciousl green chili sauce and eggs all manner of delightful flavors"}
{"text":"Best breakfast I've had in a long time ! Amazing service from red curly haired server(sorry can't remember name ) . Definitely recommended!! Great prices and I'm a server so very picky too!"}
{"text":"Need to correct my earlier review.  I thought I was on another restaurant.  This place is excellent and we will be back. Friendly courteous service and great food.  Nice selection too..."}
{"text":"My friend and I like to try new restaurants whenever we meet to catch up.  This one was rated highly on Yelp, so we decided to try it out. 

This is a good place to go if you're HUNGRY at breakfast time and don't mind not talking over the meal.  The food is good.  The eggs were done to perfection, and the hash browns were very crispy--not greasy--just the way we like it.  

A huge drawback is the horrific noise levels.  The place was almost full, but not every table was filled, and there wasn't a waiting line, so I can't even imagine how loud it is in there when the place is full and people are waiting!  I couldn't hear anything for a while after leaving--my ears were actually ringing!  And I really felt sorry for my elderly friend who wears a hearing aid--I think it was excruciating for her.  Not to mention that we couldn't catch up over breakfast as we had planned because we couldn't hear each other!  Honestly, I think the staff there should get frequent hearing checks or wear earplugs while being exposed to such noise.  

I like the food well enough to order takeout to bring to the office, but when I called, the message said they do not take phone orders.  I don't want to sit outside in the heat--or inside in the horrific noise--while waiting for an order to be cooked for me to take out, so I won't be back."}
{"text":"Our friends wanted to go here for brunch, and so of course I yelped it to make sure I knew what to expect. We ordered the chicken fried chicken with a side of orange juice. Almost got the lava pancakes too, but they were out, so that was a bit of a blessing in disguise to keep us from overeating.

The portions are gigantic, so come hungry and plan to feast on sweet & fried deliciousness. The OJ comes with a free refill. Please note this is a cash only establishment, they have an ATM in house in case. Chicken was juicy and flavorful. The servers are friendly and ambiance is standard diner atmosphere."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY ESTABLISHMENT :) Bring cash ahead of time or take advantage of the in house $0 fee ATM"}
{"text":"Great place to eat well worth the wait on the weekends food is delicious service is awesome they really take care of you they have the best orange juice around they squeeze it right in front of you I recommend this place"}
{"text":"Finally made it here and it's a good spot. The portions are big and the food is good breakfast food. I ordered a cinnamon roll appetizer and it didn't disappoint. I'm pretty sure that the child and the hubs were a little miffed that I had more than my fair share. I got the ooey gooey scramble thing and it was a giant mountain of eggs, home fries, sausage, mushrooms and I'm sure a lot of other things served with a side of toast. It was definitely good and reminded me of the breakfasts you make at home. The husband had a house special chicken and French toast which he enjoyed, I found the gravy on the chicken a bit bland. The child had a monthly special which was the churro pancakes. It came with a churro chopped up on top. I do like he hint if lemon in their pancakes fo sho. They serve china mist iced tea which always makes me happy. I would definitely come back but I would not wait more than 15 minutes for a table. The servers were super smiley and on top of it!"}
{"text":"I was in the area with a couple of my employees and stopped by this place and oh man what a great environment. Customer service was amazing, the manager John did an outstanding job making sure every table was taken care of. Good food and good service. What else could you ask for. Thank your for the wonderful experience, I will be coming here and bring my family as well."}
{"text":"If you are looking for seriously the best breakfast hands down in the Valley, look No further! This is the spot and we have never been let down if the many many visits. 
Great Service
Excellent choices for breakfast..something for everyone.
AND
FRESH SQUEEZED OJ (its out of this world good!)

With that said, see you next time Original Breakfast House...keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Yummmmm! But also.. The staff is very nice, helpful and accommodating! I was happy about the delicious food but very amazed by the outstanding customer service. Try the raspberry chocolate chip pancakes!"}
{"text":"We drive from across town just for their chicken fried steak which is AMAZING!!!  Also love their chicken fried chicken and delicious French toast. Don't forget about the orange juice!!! FRESHLY squeezed, one orange at a time. The staff is amazing and they truly love their job!  Helps that the owner is phenomenal and loves his employees, food and customers.  Looked online for the best chicken fried steak in Phoenix and this place popped up. I now understand why after going 5 times in a month."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!  Part of my meal was inedible and they didn't offer to even take that portion off my bill.  Over priced for what you get. I wish I had taken a picture. Charged me $2 just to put about 10 chocolate chips on my son's pancakes.  Usually I would give a place a second chance before I counted it out completely but I won't be going back here"}
{"text":"So. Much. Food.  And oh so delicious. We'll be coming back for sure! The freshly squeezed OJ is a must! Comes with 1 free refill and it's truly fresh and awesome! Makes you question what's in the ones they sell at the stores ;-)"}
{"text":"I'm BIG on customer service and waitress Emily has exceeded my customer service experience. Emily was knowledgeable about the menu, Provided our order in a timely manner and perform all other tasks with a nice smile. Overall, the team at OBH attains excellent hospitality! Please keep up the great work. My boyfriend and I will definitely be returning for more breakfast sessions. The food is delicious. Point. Blank. Period. We'd love to continue supporting this business. 

P.S. Thank you for introducing me to the amazing pepper plant sauce. I was missing out for so long until I visited the original breakfast house. 

Shoutout to the free OJ refill, free ATM serivce (Cash-only restaurant) and big portion platters. You're speaking my language!"}
{"text":"Awesome same like always food is great awesome hospitality and good energy in original Breakfast House I love it"}
{"text":"I do like the food and the service is always good but today I have to say was a bit disappointing. First, they rookbthe corned beef hash off the menu. Said they like to switch it up. I get it but a dish like that is a staple as far as breakfast foods go. Secondly, the bacon was over fried, just crunchy with no taste. Toast was dry as well"}
{"text":"We knew we would have to wait a little bit for breakfast on a Saturday morning. Once we were seated the waitress was prompt and friendly. The food was very fresh with the El Paso omelette being cooked perfectly and the chicken fried chicken was good. The French toast was great and I can't wait to try the pancakes next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place. Family run and it shows in their service, food and friendliness. Cinnamon bun is delicious."}
{"text":"Food and customer service are excellent. My gripe is that the ATM that is listed as \"FREE\" now that they are a cash only establishment is not actually free. We were charged $2.50 on our bank statement for this transaction after withdrawing cash to pay for our 11/20 breakfast. I understand going cash only to save money, but honesty and transparency about ATM fees is also important. Don't advertise something as free when it is not."}
{"text":"It's twenty minutes after 9:00am. The parking lot is full. There are no clouds in the Arizona sky. The sun is bright. It's a perfect Phoenix spring day.

It's 9:01am. It's a brief walk to the front door. You open it and go inside. There are people everywhere; some are sitting, some are running around. A sweet young girl asks, \"Do you want to sit at the bar or at a booth?\"

You are not alone, because the restaurant is filled with people.

Later, you walk back to your car. You are full and happy.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS

The Original Breakfast House is just a little shack at Thunderbird and 32nd Street. There was a cute mural. The parking lot was full.

Upon entering, I immediately noticed the \"CASH ONLY\" \"FREE ATM\" & \"PEOPLE LOVE US ON YELP\" signs.

I was greeted with a smile, which was not surprising since that is the hostess's job.

Despite being busy, she found me a seat.

ABOUT THE SERVICE

Once seated, I was handed over to Mike, who was cheerful. Mike recommended the Blackberry Deep Fried French Toast. DELICIOUS!!

I also ordered a fresh-pressed orange juice and a coffee. It was literally THE BEST ORANGE JUICE I've ever had. Mike told me that the orange juice included a free refill, which I took gratefully! The coffee was good. 

CONCLUSION

I've said it many times before, but I'll say it again:

You can tell the quality of the owner/management by the way the staff behaves and their customer service ethic. The owner, John Stidham, obviously runs a tight ship.

Everything is provided with GENEROSITY! Extra EVERYTHING!

It's a place that was so easy and delicious that I might make a habit of driving the 20 miles to return.

5/5 RECOMMEND

OF NOTE

*There is plenty of parking.

*They only take CASH. 

*Free ATM"}
{"text":"Always enjoy eating here! Good food, good coffee, good service...what more do you need?!! My husband likes their omelettes (always orders something different each time we go)...and says they have the fluffiest pancakes. I like their oatmeal (it's not mushy!) with banana slices, pecans, raisins and almond milk. Lots of restaurants have been on this corner and gone by the wayside. This owner is here to stay!"}
{"text":"My husband is obsessed with breakfast, so it came as no surprise that he told me this morning that he had discovered a new breakfast restaurant that we had to try out. In one word, this place is AMAZING. They use organic products, source locally, and have a very friendly staff. I was also pleasantly surprised to see how reasonable the prices were! So if you are in the mood for a good, wholesome breakfast, this is your scene. If you're wondering why you haven't been here already, it's only been open for six weeks."}
{"text":"I originally heard about this location from a local television \"foodie\" show called \"check please\" The concept of breakfast place from a locally owned business was the main reason of my visit. We all decided to visit for a fathers day brunch. Once you enter the doors you have a west coast beach feel with all the decorative designs of surfboards and VW bus wagons. 
I went ahead and ordered scrambled eggs, three strips of bacon, hash browns and two pancakes. Figured this was an appropriate meal since I LOVE breakfast! Have to say the strips of bacon were thicker than most other breakfast locations, so that was a plus! The hash browns were nice and crispy and the pancakes had a deliciously fluffy  combined with the creamy butter and syrup.
I also tasted some of the french toast with strawberry, and the bread is thicker than most toast, but the liquids it was mixed with kept it nice and moist! Cannot forget about how strong flavored the black coffee complimented the meals! Overall my whole family thoroughly enjoyed there meals and appreciated the service that our server provided for our big party!"}
{"text":"Came here this morning after seeing everyone's reviews and we we're not disappointed! The San Francisco Style French Toast was delicious and the biscuits and gravy should not be passed up. If you eat nothing else, try the cinnamon roll, it was to die for! Our waitress, Seta, was a bonus and she was so nice and helpful with lots of great suggestions. We loved seeing the owner doing everything from rolling silverware, refilling glasses and talking to all the customers who entered. We cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"I have yet to have a bad breakfast here and several have been really great. My favorite is the creamed chip beef which was added to the regular menu this year. The service is always friendly. Most mornings the owner is there. He does need to bring the menu up to date on his website and Facebook. You really need to get there before 7 or plan on waiting, a lot."}
{"text":"I am so turned off by my last experience there.  The food is always very good.  This time when we arrived there was a notice on the door that they only accept cash and have an ATM inside.  We stood in shock for a few minutes and an employee stuck his head out and said there was no charge on their end for the ATM use but probably would be from our financial institution.  We do not generally carry cash and are not going to start now.  Needless to say we did not eat there!  In this day and age when there seems to be a move away from cash to go cash only is ridiculous!  We will not be back!!"}
{"text":"Setta is superb, in fact all the staff that works here are super friendly and attentive to their clients.
As mentioned in many reviews the coffee and fresh squeezed O.J. is to die for.
Pancakes are phenomenal as was the chicken fried steak. Tough place to beat when it comes to finding a fresh home cooked meal."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast!  Believe the very high Yelp score. We had 3 different meals and they were all great. Chicken fried chicken, French toast, big gooey meal = awesome!!"}
{"text":"I have tried the French Toast and omelette so far. The French Toast was great and the omelette was outstanding. But what makes this place stand out is the service which is amazing. They really make you feel as if you are in their home!"}
{"text":"Amazing coffee. You have to try the pancakes...they put lemon zest in them and it's such an amazing taste. Brought back a sinful cinnamon roll for the Mrs.  We will see if it tastes as good as it looks."}
{"text":"In town from Minneapolis. Went here for the first time ever and it was nothing short of amazing! The staff was very nice and friendly and the food came quickly. The strawberry French toast was excellent! And the fresh squeezed orange juice is by far the best I've ever had. I'll definitely be going back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"My husband, my adult son, daughter and myself came in to eat brunch. It was my two grown children's first time and my husband and myself have been here several times over the last couple years.
Everyone ordered breakfast, pancakes and eggs, sausage and bacon. I ordered lunch. I decided on the Monte Cristo sandwich with incredibly delicious melt in my mouth ham and Swiss with a Dijon mix, and fresh fruit with homemade fresh ham for dipping. It was the best Monte Cristo I have ever had!
Our waitress was enthusiastic and helpful. She was attentive and checked back with us frequently. The rest of the employees were also friendly and helpful--clearing away our dishes and inquiring if everything was to our satisfaction.
This restaurant is a gem. We are repeat customers and we will return in the near future."}
{"text":"Delicious and unique. My son had deep fried French toast, which I thought was good. However my omelette was amazing. It was the special called the Tinga Omelette. They have fresh squeezed OJ which was fantastic as well! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great diner style place and smart ownership. Love the locally grown options and attention to detail. French toast  is a must try!"}
{"text":"This is a review long overdue. I've been coming here for almost two years. At first I fell in love with the food (thee BEST pancakes and scrambled eggs). I know, who would think scrambled eggs would be worth mentioning? But they are. After the food, I fell in love with the people who work there. It all starts when you walk in the door and see Teresa, Katie, Sierra and the owner, John. They always have a smile on their face and willing to help. They will even be in the dining room to clear your plate, give you another beverage, etc. Finally, a company who has amazing customer service and not people who sit back and say \"that's not my job\". The owner treats his employees very well and you can tell they all respect him. They are cash only now but do have a FREE ATM. Going cash only allowed the owner to give his employees extra perks that you don't usually see in the service industry. You may find a wait that looks long when you pull up. Don't let that scare you away as they turn the tables fast and the food is incredible. I promise, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great food for a great price! Family owned restaurant with great customer service. I go here almost every weekend. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Very good place. I ordered the special cheesecake pancakes. Would keep this place in mind the next time I come out to az. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Hands down the best orange juice in town! First place I have been to that when it says freshly squeezed OJ they literally mean freshly squeezed. It was such a nice treat. Went here for brunch with my husband and a friend, I ordered the fried chicken and French toast combo it was delicious. French toast was perfect and the gravy on the chicken was just so amazing! I am so glad we found this place. Prices are reasonable the only down part is they only take cash but they do have an ATM with no fees to take money out which makes up for it. Service was very good our server was friendly and attentive. We were very well taken care of during our visit. There was a small wait when we got there and they have free water bottles and a comfortable waiting area. Can't wait to go back! If you are looking for a nice family owned breakfast spot I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The service is STELLAR. You can't help but feel your mood improve after leaving. Waiters are so sweet. The owner is sweet.
Everyone is smiling.

Food is pretty good- I've had some hits/misses. (But the asparagus chicken goat cheese omelet- SO GOOD!!) The portions are huge, the prices are reasonable. The coffee is great. 

I honestly just love coming here and seeing all the different people. Friends meeting up, brunch dates, single diners reading the newspaper. It feels like living in a small town. Not some pretentious hip mimosas-serving spot. Just your friendly diner. 

Seriously- this place will forever be my favorite brunch spot."}
{"text":"Ok I have a tip. The chicken fried chicken is great but giant. Convince the person you are eating with to order it then get the super banana pancakes and split the meal up halfsies. It's perfect! Two chicken breasts. Two pancakes. Obviously get your own bacon."}
{"text":"The French toast was awesome. Get two slices with whatever else you order. Don't be cheap either, spring for the Vermont maple syrup. My steak was cooked perfectly and my eggs weren't greasy. I can't wait to come back with my family."}
{"text":"Not a bad wait and worth the 15 minutes.  I had the chk fried chk and it was great.  I will be back often."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town!!! The chicken fried chicken and French toast combo is one of the best things on the menu. You get one free refill on the fresh squeezed orange juice. The most amazing chipped beef Ive had. Daily fresh-baked cinnamon rolls. Excellent customer service. I just can't get enough of this place"}
{"text":"The Original Breakfast House is an amazing place to eat ! The breakfast is delicious with many selections ! The staff is polite and friendly - I would highly recommend OBH to everyone !"}
{"text":"Holy large portions, Batman!  I got the Big Gooey Scrambled Mess, a mix of eggs and various other breakfast meats/veggies and I was bust-a-gut full after only eating about 1/4th of it.  The preserves they serve with toast had to have been homemade because you can't get anything that good out of a jar.  The pinnacle of the breakfast was by far the fresh squeezed OJ.  I am a self proclaimed OJ snob, and I was about ready to do backflips over the deliciousness of OBH's OJ.  You get a refill with each OJ order, so you don't have to ration it to make it last throughout the meal."}
{"text":"Best comfort breakfast in town. Great service and great food. The chicken fried steak uses real sausage gravy that tastes like they make it right there.  Orange juice is squeezed right in plain view. The people are great as well.  Plan for a wait, there is usually a crowd.  Bring cash, no credit cards accepted."}
{"text":"First time here and food was not disappointing. We will definitely be back, only reason not 5 stars is because our waitress was slow. The owner was there and was very friendly, as was the younger guy related to him. Nice to add another breakfast spot to our list!"}
{"text":"Wow... Hands down the best French Toast I've ever had. I am a huge fan of French Toast and I enjoy trying new versions anytime I see them.  There is absolutely no doubt about it, the wife, kid and I will be going back multiple times. It's a bit of a drive from us, but good food is always worth it. Amazing food and a great value for the money!"}
{"text":"Brought my girlfriend here and we had an amazing breakfast. The pancakes were the best I've had since I was a kid. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone I know."}
{"text":"Great food and staff!  I'm disappointed that they no longer accept credit cards which I consider part of customer service.  :-/"}
{"text":"I would give this 5 stars if they had a french toast for purists.  The deep fried stuff is not good...it's too crunchy and greasy.  I know people rave about it in other reviews...but I can't be the only one to not enjoy the french toast here.  Just make a regular soft, eggy grilled on the flat top in butter french toast, please!"}
{"text":"Went to this location based on the reviews it has and was not disappointed. Keep in mind because of it's popularity that there is a wait time. When I went i just waited approx. 45min. We were walked to out table with a cold water jug waiting for us. Service was excellent and welcoming. I hope that the people who give a low rating to this location get exploring diarrhea. :)

I would recommend this place and happily return."}
{"text":"The only thing I did not like about this restaurant is it is too far away from my house, but maybe that's a good thing my wife and I got to the original breakfast house at 10:45 had maybe a 10 minute wait got seated. We were there for probably 45-50 minutes and the place was packed the entire time and this is during the week. My wife and I split the lemon blueberry pancakes and a special which was a caprese omelette, both were absolutely delicious and the service was absolutely wonderful had a great time will come back I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Omg! This place is amazing. Everything is made fresh and hot and tastes amazing. The staff is so friendly. We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great food. This is now my favorite place for breakfast. The carnitas omelette is so amazing. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My favorite Sunday breakfast joint! But definitely recommend to come early as wait times can be long.  However, they are extremely kind by having cold water bottles out for guests while they wait. Once you get in the service is extremely fast and friendly.  Their brioche French toast is amazing and their orange juice is a must have (for pulp lovers)."}
{"text":"Just moved here from NC and found this place on Yelp and I have to say great food and services."}
{"text":"As a breakfast-lover, this is my favorite spot in Phoenix. I hesitate to write a great review because I'd love this spot to be my secret gem...but I think the word is already out because the queue is long on the weekends. They do everything with care in this place...homemade biscuits, pop tarts and small things like fresh fruit are always fresh and delicious. The waitstaff is so friendly and if you ask about the specials, you can tell, they love the food too!"}
{"text":"It is your typical breakfast place. Ridiculous portions but the food is really great. The waffles were superb and my mom, even enjoyed her omelette. She is quite the snob when it comes to breakfast foods so for her to like the way they cooked it says it is a place worth trying. 

We were almost constantly attended to and the people behind the counter were really friendly and arrive oriented. 

The place is a bit outdated, lacked spark, and when we first sat down there was a long wait for someone to get to us. 

Will I go back? Maybe. It's a better alternative to the lame Denny's or IHOP, that's for sure! Food is good though so if you are looking for a nice, big, typical breakfast I suggest going here."}
{"text":"Pancakes were good. Lamb was just okay. Hubs had the El Paso and he said it was good but soggie because they didn't drain the beans."}
{"text":"Decievingly modern on the inside compared with the older diner outside appearance. 

Had the hot chocolate to start and it was deliciously topped with a light whipped cream and chocolate sauce. 

I had the raspberry and chocolate chip pancakes while he had the corned beef hash special. Not sure if I like the lemon flavor added to the pancakes or not but the pancakes themselves were light and fluffy. The raspberries were really fresh and delicious.

He had the corned beef hash special and that came with two eggs cooked any way - he picked scrambled. Oddly enough the corned beef really tasted like salted ham, which isn't bad but not what we expected. 

Overall: B+
I think we will order other options next go around but it was tasty!"}
{"text":"Breakfast this morning was perfect! We strolled in around 8a expecting a wait, but there was none. We were seated right away and our server was friendly and greeted us with a smile on her face. We decided to share the Banana Pecan French toast, scrambled eggs and bacon. We added a side of hash browns and when the food was delivered to us, the kitchen split the plate for us. 

We chowed down and the French Toast was delicious!! It had the perfect crunch and fluff. Our server dropped our check and the bill was less than $20. We were full and happy!"}
{"text":"Chicken fried chicken and french toast. Do it!

Came here on Veterans Day to eat with my veteran friend. They were giving out free meals to all vets! How awesome is that? The owner is a vet so he gets the sacrifice that military men and women make to serve our country. I would give them 5 stars for that alone, but honestly I am just giving them 5 stars for the chicken fried chicken and French toast. This is fried french toast and chicken with gravy on it so if you're on a diet, it's probably not for you. If you like to indulge every once in a while though, this is the way to do it. Everything was delicious. OJ was legit, fresh squeezed. Service was awesome. I really have nothing bad to say about this place."}
{"text":"Great place! Great service! Great food! I'm hooked and looking forward to going back and trying everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Always like to find a good breakfast spot when I travel and this place did not disappoint. Inside the place is very inviting with a good mix of music (volume level was perfect) and ambiance. I went on a weekday around 0830 so I was immediately seated. I ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs with wheat toast. The cf steak was very good with jus the right amount of breading. The fruit was fresh and the toast was not from a grocery store. 
The thing that really topped it off was the customer service from more than one server and even the owner stopped by to ask how everything was. I will make this a regular stop whenever I am in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Had breakfast at O.B.H on Monday food is so good, great portions,.and price.  I tries the Juans Tacos after another customer had suggested them. Delicious!! Perfect so ice am blend.for.me.  I added the French Toast omg we will be back. D-lish!!."}
{"text":"We like the Original Breakfast House so much we drive from Glendale for their breakfast.  They have a comprehensive breakfast menu and serve breakfast until closing and lunch all day.  It is a popular destination so there could be a wait, but once seated and your order placed, your meal arrives promptly.  Check out their specials on the board behind the counter.

We think you will like this family run establishment. Give it a try. What do you have to lose?  We are sure you will come back time and again like us."}
{"text":"The man and I decided to try a new breakfast joint. Chose this place based on reviews. We have no clue how it has such high reviews. The food was way under seasoned and over cooked. He got the pork chop and eggs special. Pork chops were not seasoned at all and over cooked.  The toast seemed as if it was toasted early and left out sitting, which is understandable during busy times as they get used quickly, but it was slow. I ordered chicken fried chicken. The chicken was forgettable, the gravy was not cooked out so you could taste the starch, french toast tasted like a bland funnel cake. 

Service was awful as well. I asked her for the cinnamon roll to be served while we wait for our meals. She asked if we wanted it heated and we said yes. It NEVER arrived. She realized she forgot a steak knife and I asked for ketchup. She never came back with it until I had to ask for the ketchup to help me finish the meal. She dropped off the check without even asking if we needed anything else.

The only good thing was the coffee. No return business from us."}
{"text":"My husband and I happened to be in Phoenix and looking for Sunday breakfast and found this wonderful place. At 10 am on a Sunday they quoted a 20 minute wait,  and it was just that (that is very resonable). I do love coffee and for $2.50 you get a never ending carafe...no vanilla or hazelnut creamers, just  half and half, but the coffee is worth it. I rarely drink more than 1 cup, but had 3.  Excellent diner drip coffee!    Yes, the OJ is fresh and you get a free refill, but it IS massive orange pulp, my husband spit out 2 seeds.  Still,  the FLAVOR  is wonderful! 

On to the food!   I had the El Paso Omelette,  omitted the chorizo and asked for bacon!  My husband had the San Francisco French toast, triple berry special.   Mine was 3 fluffy eggs in an omelette with God knows how many pieces of crispy, smoky crumbled bacon, that substituted the chorizo... succulent onions,  medium spicy green chiles, tender tomatoes, wonderful savory black beans and melted cheddar cheese! Along  with the home fries that were so savory and flavorful.   They reminded me of what was served from my grandmother's cast iron skillet! Plus instead of toast, got 2 fluffy, light pancakes, scented with lemon zest.  It's a very unassuming flavor, but citrus is designed to clean the palate so you can eat more without feeling so full!   Not a bad thing! 

 My husband's San Francisco French toast,  on sourdough and then deep fried to give that final crunch, was incredible.  And with the 3 berries (strawberry, blueberry,  blackberry) and hot  maple syrup made it a special, but not TOO sweet combo. Plus 2 over medium perfect eggs and 2 slices of exceptional crispy bacon! 

We don't often get to Phoenix, but always have Sunday breakfast.  It was $33.00 plus tip, a little more for breakfast, but for what we got,  it was well worth it!"}
{"text":"We stayed at Westin in Scottsdale and needed a place to eat. Went here because of good yelp reviews.

Life changing breakfast burrito.
Juan's tacos excellent as well.

Completely unpretentious.
Service was very kind.
Spoke with owner who was very nice as well.

Perfect SW breakfast. (And I am a very picky critic)"}
{"text":"Best breakfast food - the food is amazing

bacon is thick and crispy

pancakes are so fantabulous

OMG... I'm hungry thinking about it right now!"}
{"text":"Great food at a reasonable price the waitresses were friendly only thing is cash only."}
{"text":"Great local breakfast place! Food is fantastic; large portions! Asparagus and goat cheese scramble, garden veggie hash, chicken tinga, and French toast were delicious. OJ is a must buy. It's busy, loud, and crowded on weekends but the food and service are worth it. Before you complain about the cash only part, please read the owner's rationale and then decide whether you support it. (It clearly doesn't seem to keep away the crowds.)"}
{"text":"We went to Phoenix Arizona for my husband's nieces wedding. We yelp to find a good breakfast restaurant and we came to this restaurant.   It was 7 of us they told us it would take 45minutes to be seated.  We were okay with that.  Finally it was more than hour and I went in to ask how much longer.  The hostess said they were waiting for the tables to be available so we can all be together.   Looking at one side there was a couple who just got their breakfast the other ta le was waiting to order.  We asked then maybe we should be seperated.  They sat us down at 2 different 2 tables when my husband noticed the other side of the room the table they were waiting the people were getting ready to leave.  We advised the waitress along with the hostess.   When the owner son comes up and tells me he woke up in a bad mood and this was very inconvenience to move us to a different table.  And if he moves us he was going to be even more in a bad mood.  I was so surprised he said that SO UNPROFESSIONAL and So RUDE!  If it wasn't for waiting this long and we were hungry we would of walked out.  But instead I told the hostess and the waitress.  They apologized for his ruthless behavior.  The waitress was Awesome the food was good.  I know the owner knew but not once did he come up and apologize."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow but that was to be expected with not one empty seat in the house and this was on a Tuesday at brunch hour. The servers were all really friendly and the owner came out to personally thank my table for dining. The food was good. It had a good home cooked taste to it not like something from ihop."}
{"text":"One of my fave spots for breakfast! The staff is always incredibly friendly and provides phenomenal service. The atmosphere is laid back and cozy and the food is always delicious. The French toast and rancheros are the best! And the portions are HUGE. You will leave here completely full and satisfied!"}
{"text":"Been here twice. Seated quickly both times and helped very quickly. Seem to have lots of hard working staff to keep things moving. 
Food is decent. Didn't really care for the French toast as it is deep fried and is more like something you'd expect to get at a county fair. Just a little too greasy for me. Otherwise the meal was good both times. 
They're going to no longer accept credit cards based on fees. While I get that, cash only isn't going to work out. They're going to put a ATM in front but that's just more fees for me even if they don't have it charge a fee my bank will. Based on the inconvenience of having to use cash when I should be able to use my phone, and the good but not great food I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"To start:  Great service, especially when you take into effect other restaurants here in AZ.  Food was very good also without busting the bank. Wish the biscuits and gravy were better but the hash browns make up for it!  I'll come back next time we're in AZ."}
{"text":"Always interested in finding new mom-and-pop shops for a good meal, we tried this place yesterday. This is a must go. It is, thankfully, not a chain (local or out of town) and it does not advertise as being the \"next best thing.\"  What it is...is great. A down to  earth  unpretentious place  that  serves great food (El Paso and spinach omelettes were scrumptious, toast was superb (not the typical ok-no-big-deal toast) and jam supplied by a Tucson-based vendor. Come to think of it, the bread may be suuplied by a Tucson vendor as well. Desiree was our server and she was great. No fewer than 3 other staff checked on us to make sure that the coffee (excellent), o.j. (a refill on the house...and it is GOOD o.j.) and everything else was to our liking. The place started to become booked at about 9:30ish as we were on  our way out.   I highly recommend OBH for a solid breakfast, great service, and a good addition to the Breakfast List.  Dr. B."}
{"text":"Leave the diet at home unless you on the see food diet and you want to leave thinking Did I Eat That???? Big Gooey, lemony pancakes, fresh fresh fresh orange juice- sweet as sugar! Don't make sense to be that good!"}
{"text":"Breakfast at this place is straight up amazing. I've taken multiple friends and coworkers, as well as my parents when they visited, and everybody has loved it. My go-to is the five egg whites scramble or the French toast."}
{"text":"Awesome spot! Adorable inside, super friendly staff, and the food!!!! I got biscuits and gravy, steak and eggs, AND the banana pecan French toast..... Just awesome, all of it was! I would eat there again in a second! My boyfriend got the chicken fried steak which was so dang good, and the fresh squeezed orange juice, to die for!!! You MUST go!!!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a good place for breakfast this morning...boy did we pick right!!!!  This place was hopping and the vibe was great. A little north of downtown (11 miles or so) but well worth the trip, plus it's not like there's any traffic to really keep you from not going here. We started with the Brioche Cinnamon Rolls, let me tell you...heaven. We then got the Country Apple Sausage Scramble and the French Toast Combo. The coffee was good and the fresh squeezed orange juice was such a thirst quencher. The food was AMAZING!!!!!  Definitely a must when in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Best pancakes in the valley. I never order pancakes but these are fantastic. Every thing I have had at this restaurant is fabulous. Best staff in the valley, friendly and caring. Doesn't seem to be a pretense either, they all seem to enjoy their jobs. Love the funky tie died shirts also."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I drove far out of my way to come here based on yelp reviews and everyone was right!! 

Original Breakfast House really is a gem that at least for me, was off the beaten path. Exceptionally clean, very friendly staff and their mission statement of only using locally sourced ingredients and cage free eggs made me very happy knowing that I was really supporting my local communities. 

Let's get down to the food, one of us had the special of the day, a spinach and bacon quiche with a side of fresh fruit. The quiche filling was phenomenal, the eggs, bacon, spinach and spices were all blended together deliciously and the side of fruit was actually fresh and cut quite well, none of that old crap you get elsewhere. 

I had the biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs and a side of hash browns. The biscuits were fresh homemade and fluffy, the gravy thick and creamy!

The only cons were the hash browns, too greasy for me to eat and the crust on the quiche was lacking flavor and slightly undercooked. 

This would've been a 4 star review but the exceptionally friendly staff and the fact that it was extremely clean are what pushed this up to 5. Will be coming back to sample other items in the future!"}
{"text":"Best. Place. Ever. I LOVE to eat here all the time. I am becoming a regular because it so delicious and a great place to be with family and friends. I enjoy the chorizo burrito as well as the chilaquiles it's just so amazing to eat such amazing, mouth watering food! I love it! Thank you for an amazing place to go to. It is cash only now but I don't mind especially for the great service and the great amazing food!"}
{"text":"We're always looking for a good breakfast joint to try, so we drove across town to try this place.   It was great!

After a 10 minute wait, we got in.   The service was fast and friendly.  

I was torn between the Huevos Rancheros and the Chicken Fried Chicken.    My wife got the CFC, and I got the Huevos Rancheros so we could share.    Mine was really good, but the Chicken Fried Chicken was killer.   Seasoned perfectly, and the french toast had a ton of flavor with the right amount of cinnamon. 

Even the Orange Juice was fresh squeezed with lots of pulp.    

These guys know what they're doing.    For us it was worth the 45 minute drive.   We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went with my family on a Saturday morning so I expected it to be busy and we really don't mind a  wait if the food is good.  You can definitely tell that they use high-quality ingredients, unfortunately even good ingredients don't taste good when they are cold! Waitress did her best and brought out new plates quickly and sadly they were warm, but not hot! Maybe caught them on a bad day however; most likely won't go back:("}
{"text":"It was good. I can't lie the French toast was yummy for my tummy. It was super busy and super loud."}
{"text":"Great menu. Awesome food. Place was packed and had a wait for good reason! I There is pretty much every thing you can imagine on the breakfast menu and all the dishes that came to our table were great and the portions huge (you could easily split!)."}
{"text":"Reminds me of the Coffee Pot in Sedona with the family feel, generous portions, good food, and friendly service.

I would love to see fresh corned beef added into the mix, but the menu is by no means skimpy.

This is our first time, so can only endorse the custom omlette, banana french toast, cinnamon rolls, and coffee. 

We'll be back again!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service.  Coffee pot on the table, food has great fresh flavor.  I really enjoyed my breakfast here and I'll return.  The waitresses are cute and friendly.   

Next time I am in Phoenix I've bookmarked this place to visit."}
{"text":"Breakfast options galore! Hence the name the Original Breakfast House. Busy schedule n the weekend so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Great place a must. I highly recommend this place , the pancakes are great and the fruit is fresh"}
{"text":"OMG!! I felt at home as soon as I stepped foot in the door. We were greeted by a very nice older gentleman.  He made my day. So sweet and friendly!! Food was GREAT!! Had the waffles with berries. Best I've had! My father had a chicken fajitas omelet.  Yum!! The bottled salsa tasted just like homemade.  I'm from Chicago but if we come back to AZ, we will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I had a ridiculously good biscuits w/sausage gravy. Lots of sausage and perfect amount of black peppery goodness. Fresh OJ was awesome. Good food and really friendly service-worth the short wait."}
{"text":"First Yelp review...  Consider myself a foodie.  Was staying at the Hilton and stopped bye for a good breakfast as I am not a fan of hotel food.  Loved the food!   Chicken fried chicken was amazing.  My 12 year old daughter made me order seconds and my family ate mine.  All kids (4) loved the French toast.  I would highly recommend if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Nice place to go for brunch. You'll probably have to wait for a table if you come after church on a Sunday, but once you get your food you'll understand why everyone comes here. It's a pleasant change from IHOP and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great family owned and operated place to eat good food. Fresh, large portions, and friendly staff make this a place I go on a regular basis."}
{"text":"As always our meal was perfect! I had pancakes and chicken sausage and my hubby had an omelette. I'm now on my couch in a food coma, lol!"}
{"text":"The service was a little slow to start but once we were greeted it moved along fine. This is hands down the best breakfast I've had in Arizona! based off of yelp reviews I've read, I went with the combo of banana pecan French toast with  chicken fried  chicken, sausage gravy and eggs. I was not disappointed! even the fresh squeezed oj was delicious. I don't know how no one's heard of this place. My family and I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Everything from the Cortez coffee to the Chocolate Raspberry Pancakes, everything is outstanding! Hope they keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"My wife had the pecan French toast and I had the raspberry chocolate chip pancakes. Awesome, food and great service. I recommend going on a weekday though. It gets slammed on the weekends."}
{"text":"YUM!!
Everything we had was delicious and it was so reasonably priced.
Fresh squeezed orange juice and free refills? Yes, please!
Kids meals for $2.50!
Everything was so fresh, too!
Our waitress was very friendly.
SUPER cute remodel of the place too, from what it had been before!!
We will be back, this is our new breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"What is the first thing you do when you move to a new neighborhood? You look for local, original, great breakfast joints for those Saturday or Sundays you don't feel like making breakfast at home. Thank goodness there is Yelp and hubby found this place after a little research and we knew we found our place after reading that they use produce from local farms and even some organic ingredients. 

I noticed that only a few places in Phoenix take your name down on a Sunday morning, so we headed over there around 9:30 risking a long wait. Surprisingly, we only had to hang around for fifteen minutes before we got seated. 

The menu wasn't big and they have really good decaf coffee, so we were off to a great start. As for the breakfast itself goes, hubby is ¼ Portuguese, so he had to try the linguica eggs (side of meat biscuit and gravy) and I couldn't take my eyes off of the banana pecan pancakes on the menu. We ended up sharing everything and were super full by the end. The biscuit and gravy tasted super fresh and was probably one of the best I have had. 

By the time we left it was 11 am and there was a long line of people outside, so try to go there early if you want to avoid the crowed."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast place.  They offer some unique, unusual, but delicious breakfast options.  I ordered a cinnamon roll and the raspberry  chocolate pancakes.  Girlfriend ordered the fried French toast and loved it.   Some of the prices, like my warm $4 tiny glass of super pulpy OJ, and there not so clean outdated bathroom is what holds this at only 4 stars!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in the quality of the food here and believe I was misled by other yelp reviews. The staff and service was great. Very friendly and prompt people. However the food just didn't do it for me. I had French toast that, eggs and the lemon scone. The lemon scone tasted like it was not homemade and had little flavor. The French toast was not flavorful and the syrup was cheap and sticky. I will not be returning"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic (pancakes were exceptional)!  We had a good experience with the server and the rest of the staff we encountered.  The food was fresh, pretty fast and appropriately priced for how tasty it was. (I had the 5 whites omelette, very good!).  We will definitely be skipping Dennys and IHOP in the future.  I plan to get there early on the weekends. Its packed and for good reason. A Tuesday morning was a great time to go try it for the first time."}
{"text":"This spot is located across the way from our home, so we decided to try it based on the good reviews. My veggie omelette was so greasy, and there were 5x more veggies than there were eggs. It was not very good. My bf got pancakes and even those weren't very good, and they were dry- it's was a bummer after waiting for over an hour for a seat on Sunday. It's unfortunate that it's so close and wasn't as good as the other reviews we read before going."}
{"text":"I flipping love this place! The chicken fried chicken is outstanding! Also don't leave without having a cinnamon roll!! Best in your life!"}
{"text":"Good quality food. Has become my favorite breakfast spot since moving into the area. Even borrowed some of their ideas to incorporate into recipes at home."}
{"text":"This place is NOT BABY FRIENDLY, they didn't have a kids menu my daughter is 1.5yrs. The food was amazing BUT to get my daughter two scrambled eggs and two pieces of sausage it ended up costing more then my omelet! Then I had to change her diaper, I asked if they had a changing table in their bathroom? They said No. seriously?! So we went out to the car I changed my daughters diaper, then I went inside their restaurant went to the bathroom and left her poopy diaper at the bottom of the trash! So seriously if u want to be a great restaurant be more \"baby\" friendly & install some diaper changing tables, babies gotta use the restroom too :)
I will say again though, the food was DELICIOUS!!"}
{"text":"Not the greatest experience here, just moved into the neighborhood and figured after a long month of unpacking I'd start by trying out local restaurants and came across OBH decided to stop by and give it a shot due to its reviews and let me tell you, I ordered the French toast SF style with eggs and bacon. My girlfriend ordered the same. We were both sick the entire day. Either the bacon was cooked poorly or they were using bad oil on the bacon but something wasn't right."}
{"text":"3 stars remain. After not going back to Original Breakfast House for a few years, we decided to give it another go on a Sunday morning recently. It was packed so there was a wait, but not too long. We were seated and greeted promptly. Overall the service was much better this time.

I ordered scrambled eggs, bacon, fruit and a biscuit. My husband got the big gooey scramble mess (that's actually the name) with pancakes. The food came out really fast.

My breakfast was just okay. The eggs and bacon were fine but the biscuit was kind of plastic tasting. Maybe it was too much bisquick or something. The taste was way off. 

The scramble mess was better. And it was huge. The two of us could have easily split that and still had leftovers. The pancakes were good too. Better than last time. Until I got to the raw part in the middle! I get that they are moving fast in the kitchen, but make sure the food is cooked! Strike two on the pancakes at this place!

Maybe third time is the charm? After two experiences that were mixed I don't know how soon we'll go back. If ever."}
{"text":"First things first,  this is a cash only joint,  but they do have an ATM if you need. 
Original Breakfast House makes me wish I'd never awarded 5 stars to any other establishment before because it is truly a cut above. It's the whole experience from the old school ambience of the space to the kindness of the staff to the omg amazing food. It's a really special place. There's nothing contrived about it. 
How could I have missed it for 20 years?!
Try it.  You won't be disappointed,  and you will likely be back again and again."}
{"text":"This place was great! The food was delicious and the service better than almost anywhere else I've been. The French toast is the way French toast should be done! Amazing! This coming from a guy who doesn't like French toast until after eating theirs! 

Food portions are BIG! They actually make your eggs to order..soft scramble actually showed up to par! A big pet peeve of mine. The chicken fried chicken was very juicy and tender although would have preffered more spice on the breading.

My daughter had the El Paso omelette. Huge, tasty with a bit of zip! I'm ordering it the next time. OJ freshly squeezed and everything is locally sourced and organic. Highly rcommend."}
{"text":"I like be in s Calif. Every time I go to phx this is a must stop !!
The biscuits and gravy is a must !!!"}
{"text":"Family atmosphere. All employees work so well together and provide exceptional service!!!  Pancakes are fantastic!!!!!!  They even OFFERED to-go cups for our coffee. Every meal out should be a experience like this one. Thank you,Nick and crew!  IT'S PANCAKE TIME!!! YEAH!"}
{"text":"Great portions and tasty lunch.  We stopped by after an appointment nearby.  I had an open faced chili cheese burger and my partner had a NM green chile burger. We also split a larger cinnamon roll. We totally enjoyed this neighborhood comfort food place.  Next time we're in the neighborhood we are stopping by again."}
{"text":"I used to come in here when the old restaurant was there. Came in one Sunday morning after church. Do you know how busy this place is? It must be good! 

Put our name on the list. Joked about being every name they called before us. They told us we would have a 20 minute wait. 

Inside was very cozy. Not over stuffed, but full. 

Coffee mug already on the table awaiting that delicious hot black drink I was about to drink. The waitress brought 3 kinds of creamer. Thought that was awesome! 

Look at this menu! So much beautiful breakfast food.  I ordered the big gooy something. I could not remember what I ordered because I was so busy looking at everyone else's plate. Are they super sized? So much food! 

Then- the magical moment- our food arrives at the table! My plate was overflowing with eggs, cheese, mushrooms, onion and potatoes. I did not even get to finish it because there was so much deliciousness! 

Took home leftovers and had it again for dinner. 

By the way, the servers are fabulous! Sammy Jo always has a huge smile!  

THANK YOU ALL!!!!"}
{"text":"They only take cash but have an ATM in the front by the door in case you forget. The service was nice and the food was good."}
{"text":"Friendly staff & delish food. We had chicken fried steak & eggs, the gravy was incredible. Banana & pecan French toast was super yummy. Chilaquiles w/ chorizo was BOMB! The waitress, Kagan was so sweet & since it was our first time she brought us a sample of carnitas too because we were so indecisive! Highly recommend this place! We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I've been wanting a breakfast restaurant like this in our neighborhood for years. The wait was worth it. I had the 5 egg white scramble with fruit instead of potatoes, and whole wheat toast. There was no extra charge for the fruit, it was a good sized bowl with cantalope, honeydew, watermelon, strawberries, bananas and grapes. Everything was fresh, from the veggies in my scramble to all of the fruit.  The food is really good quality, certainly as good as Scramble, Over Easy and Liberty Market. Even the bread used for toast was exceptional. They did a good remodel of the place. When it was Gino's Coast to Coast, it was dark and dingy. They recovered the booths, redid the table tops, brought in new chairs and lighting, and gave the place a coat of light, fresh paint inside and out. At last, we've got a wonderful breakfast place, without driving all over town. We will be regulars."}
{"text":"If you are near this place...
It's a must stop for consistency great food and service. The orange juice is squeezed fresh while you watch! They do every dish better than you can do at home! Family owned and operated. You'll meet the owner and son at nearly every visit. It's a destination breakfast place. Avoid the wait and sit at the counter!"}
{"text":"Hello fellow Yelpers! Tired of going to your chains such as Denny's, IHOP and Waffle House? Then I'd suggest you run your azz over to Original Breakfast. 

NOTE: Be prepared to wait for a table. Yes, they're pretty slammed on the weekends. 

I ordered the Big Gooey Scramble Mess and when I tasted it, thought I was in some divine universe because I heard harps and saw angels circling. True story.

Even their black coffee was great, ppl! And, it was presented in our very own carafe for self-service warmups?! Whaa?? 

Service was so accommodating (by bestie and I prefer to sit in booths on the perimeter, not at table in middle of room), by moving us to a better table. Our server did frequent check-ins and answered our questions without any 'tude. I did tip her very well. 

So, it's settled - I think I'm in lust/love with this restaurant. I'm in deep, folks."}
{"text":"Been here several times now.  The food is fantastic, the staff is friendly and the food is fantastic, oh did I say that twice?  Well it is.  I've tried several different dishes now and never been disappointed.  The French Toast, linguicia scramble, biscuits and gravy, have all been awesome.  My buddy tried the chicken fried steak and eggs and was equally pleased."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor & eat here (but don't forget cash only!). It was our first time here and good lawd the FRENCH TOAST. It took my taste buds straight to a heaven with every bite! I stole bites of my boyfriends the entire meal. 

I chose to go with the breakfast sandwich on sourdough. Ham, egg, cheese, bacon, onions. Delicious and the shining moment was no grease on the plate, my hands, or my napkin! 

Excellent service and cannot wait to be back."}
{"text":"Can you say Yummy?! I've been here quite a bit & have always forgotten to write a review. (\"Not sure why, because this place is awesome!!\") The pancakes are one of my fav's. They're always soft & fluffy with a hint of lemon. Sooo good! Another fav is the Popeye Omelette. 
Pro tip: It gets pretty busy on the weekend, so phone ahead to put your name on the list if can. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Denver omelette with hash browns and bicuits and gravy...big enough for two. Great service and delicious meaty omelettes. 20 minute wait on a Saturday at 10 am, but worth waiting for.  If you are from san diego think \" family house resteraunt\"!  Friendly prompt service, roll back to the 70's!!!  Upgraded atmosphere would make it 5 stars, was loud and \"open\" seating, family style!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and good food! The waitress said she loves her job and that the owner is a wonderful man who treats his employees very well. That's rare and says a lot in my book."}
{"text":"Friendly place with a variety of yummy breakfast items. Check out their fresh baked items. I love their green chile omelette. Be prepared to wait if you go later in the morning, but they put up shade for their outdoor waiting area."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service!!! Best breakfast in town. We got the blackberry French toast and it was crispy on the outside and deep fried in the inside - some of the best fresh toast we've ever had. The blackberries were fresh on top and a delicious treat.

We also got eggs Benedict and omelet - both fantastic!"}
{"text":"My breakfast place when I visit Phoenix! It is always busy and thriving with customers...that alone is a sign of delicious food! I wish they would have zucchini for my omelet though...some day!"}
{"text":"I am from out of town and pick this place based on the reviews.  My wife and I were not disappointed!  I was so excited when I saw that they had Dutch baby pancakes.  I was able to pick the fruit I wanted in mine and it was delicious.  Next time I am in town I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"In 2017 AZCentral released an article of the top 15 breakfast places in the Valley. Of these we enjoyed 13, but this one kills all the competition for me, including Matt's Big Breakfast. Their food is on par with Matt's, but their service and facilities are much nicer. I love their Californian casual surfer ambiance, their very friendly service, and their rotating specials. We get out to this place about once a month now."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time yesterday. I had high expectations from all the good reviews on Yelp, but I was disappointed with my meal. I ordered the French toast special, and wanted to try the strawberry flavor but was told it would be $2 extra. No thanks. So I got the original kind with 2 eggs and substituted hash browns instead of bacon/sausage. The latter two items were all right, nothing to rave about. I thought the French toast would be amazing since they use sourdough bread and add orange zest and vanilla, but it turned out to be too heavy and not very good. 
I'd rather go to Village Inn, they've got a great V.I.B special (choose 4 items for $7)."}
{"text":"Great place with very friendly staff. To start we had a 10 minute wait but they have a wonderful shaded patio area to wait at that made it much nicer than most places. Their French toast is amazing...bread was terrific. Their fresh squeezed OJ is the best I've had in Phoenix. We took home a giant fresh cinnamon roll to go because we had to try it but we're too stuffed to eat it there. They gave us coffee to go and couldn't have been more accommodating. We will definitely be back to this little hidden gem."}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations, which were high to begin with.  Even the side of whole wheat toast was good.  I ordered the carnitas omelet and it was made to perfection.  The pork melted in my mouth. The side of hash browns had a nice crispness to the outside that I love.  My absolute go to breakfast joint when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I was fortunate enough to be stationed in Monterey, CA twice so I was sold by the owner information.  I have been here a few times, and have never been disappointed.  I often dream of the black beans and little fluffy (have to be homemade) tortillas, unfortunately those dreams are usually after 2 pm.  I love a good breakfast/lunch spot, until I want breakfast for dinner.  Oh well.  Just know everything here is quality, it is very apparent they have  a large group of devoted customers, and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"I was going to breakfast with my father and I just wanted chocolate chip pancakes and we go here and I think they probs have good pancakes I mean it's not that hard to make batter and throw chips in there but no. They don't just use chocolate chips, instead of milk in the batter they use lemon like who in the right mind does that. I would like to sit down with the chef and simply ask him the simple question: where did you get the idea oh ya lemon in pancakes will really just make people want my pancakes? Will not be returning"}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant with yummy bakery good to view and smell right when you walk in. Parking is plentiful and the restaurant has fast service. My Dad & I are not Arizona residents so we came here based on the yelp reviews and I have to say I am in agreement with other reviews that this place is a great breakfast establishment. Have confidence in coming here you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"San Francisco style deep fried French Toast, Chicken Fried Chicken, Fresh Squeezed OJ, locally sourced coffee and the service are amazing!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for breakfast since accidently discovering this very popular place a few years ago. The wait isn't bad (even on a Sunday at 9:00am) and always worth it; great food that's well prepared accompanied by exceptional portions (we always have left-overs) and friendly customer service. Have even ventured into enjoying eggs and spam!  Don't miss the French toast - simply the best anywhere."}
{"text":"This place gets SuUUuUUper crowded on the weekends.  There's usually a thirty minute wait.  When we got there this past weekend, the restaurant was nice enough to set out some ice cold bottled water for everyone waiting since it was already hot so early in the morning.

The food here is great.  And the orange juice is extra sweet.  You also get a free refill with your orange juice.  We asked for ours, but it never came. :P

Regardless, I would recommend the Original Pancake House.  Even the banana / walnut pancakes were delicious.

Sausage and eggs were good too.

Plenty of parking.  Just look for The Rock (Church) and it's in the same shopping mall."}
{"text":"GO HERE!!! You can stop trying to decide where to go for breakfast because this is the place! Everything about this place is amazing. The servers are always so friendly and genuinely happy to help you. It has a sort of a retro feel which I think is cool. Every single thing I've ever ordered has been delicious! The two chicken friend chickens, french toast and one egg meal is an exceptionally good choice, especially for your first time. I also like that the owner is there a lot and greats the customers. This is probably the best breakfast in the valley!"}
{"text":"Had one of their specials of the day for breakfast: pulled BBQ pork with eggs and potatoes.  SO good!  Everything we had was great and the service was really friendly."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews I was excited to go here! On my first visit I had the corn beef hash which I found to be disappointing. It was cut up little pieces of corn beef, that was still tough. Corn beef is best served very well cooked and tender and shredded preferably by a blender or food processor. The mixed berry French toast looks very good so I decided to go back a second time to try those. They were very disappointing. They were deep-fried all you could taste was the oil they had been fried in the only plus to them was that the berries were fresh! With all the rave reviews i had expected a much better meal and I gave them two tries, I will not be going back again my money is better spent somewhere else."}
{"text":"Will def be back , great breakfast food .. Unique deep fried French toast . The fresh squeezed Oj is so good , and you get 1 refill with the Oj (most places you don't) . Even the jelly for your toast is homemade . So many good sounding choices on the menu . A must try if your in the area !"}
{"text":"Where do you start . Everything we have tried here has been a hit - be it the omelettes or the pancakes. We have tried the following and loved all of them . 
1. John Wayne Western 
2. Popeye 
3. Farmers Market 
All of them are really good . They dont accept reservations which is the only downside - you need to either time when you go there or be prepared for the wait - but the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Price to the said quality of ingredients was good. My wife and I just left a little under-whelmed.

The food wasn't raw or bad. We just were not as impressed as people have been raving about it. Maybe we went in with higher hopes than we should have. 

The place is nice, clean. Friendly staff. The OJ seemed like it was fresh mixed with something else. Maybe it was just me, (i don't really drink fresh OJ that often to be a connoisseur).

I got the big messy breakfast (or something of that similar name). Tiny slices of sausage in it. Nothing to leave me wanting to order this again. 

I would come back to order something different off the menu. I feel that they have redemptive quality, but for now 3 stars."}
{"text":"Five stars!!! Absolutely delicious! Dezarae checked on us appropriately and the food was to die for. Pretty crowded for 8am Sunday morning but it was expected. Everyone was so friendly and we enjoyed our meal throughly. The wife had banana pancakes with bacon and eggs (pancake special) & I had 2 slices French toast. Omg it was so good! Huge portion sizes so we had to take the rest home."}
{"text":"The best breakfast I've ever had!!! On the outside on the building I could never imagined the food inside would be so good. The first visit I had the banana French toast & bacon. It was absolutely amazing!!! My second visit I got the chicken and French toast. The chicken was moist and seasoned well. The service was great!"}
{"text":"kinda salty on my first visit and second visit the waitress acted like she did not want to be there. so I decided to give another try- I don't know why when the previous visits were total let downs. I called to try to put in for take out and the answering machine( no one picks up the phone there) said they don't do take out. oh well! sorry original breakfast house, your name certainly fits you because your take on treating customers, your gratuitous use of salt and your idea behind take out is just that, original, as in no other establishment turns off customers quite like you do."}
{"text":"If you're looking to open up a successful local restaurant, I suggest coming in here and taking detailed notes. But be sure that, while doing so, you're eating some of their deep fried French toast.

I remember dining at Original Breakfast House with my girlfriend during their earlier days. It was popular then and, over time, has become increasingly more popular to the point where wait times can sometimes be not what you'd expect for a place operating out of this area.

The thing is, the success is very well deserved.

Okay. So I'll openly admit, there are a few better breakfast places in Phoenix if we're going to talk about specific items. But the reason why I think OBH has continued to work so well is that, rather than putting so much emphasis one or two single items to sell the place, they manage to make consistently good food that has never disappointed either myself or my girlfriend. 

Look at the wall photographs or read up on the restaurant's owner. The man has quite a history in the restaurant business and clearly knows exactly what he's doing. Plus, he always seems to be there, which doesn't seem to be the case for most places once they become so successful.

Do I like their adoption of a \"Cash Only\" policy? Honestly, I understand the logic, but still see it as a bit of an inconvenience considering I stopped carrying cash around 14 years ago. Personally, I'd be more content with just paying a \"convenience charge\" on my card, but oh well. If you look at the crowds, I'm pretty sure their loyal customers don't mind, even though I'd admittedly come a bit more often if it didn't require me to detour to my bank's ATM every time.

Note: There are ATM(s) on-site that are free to use - although most likely are not free from your own personal bank fees.

Anyway, I enjoy their little twists on traditional foods. My girlfriend typically orders their banana and pecan pancakes, while I always request a side of their deep fried French toast, regardless of what else I end up getting. 

Servers are always prompt and pleasant. We've never ran into an any real issues. A request for hot coffee after the original pot was barely lukewarm was resolved without any fuss.

It's always nice to see local places like this grow to amass such a huge following. And I also think it serves as a very good example that you don't need a fully stocked bar with trendy mixologists, techno music, and over-the-top menu items in order to be successful.

Just serve good breakfast and do so consistently. I wish more places would mirror this approach.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"First time here environment great. Busy but not that much wait time food smells amazing. Orange juice so fresh and so good. Well will see what the food taste like in a bit. The service seem good. The waitress was very nice. Fast on the orange juice refills."}
{"text":"Best chicken fried steak and gravy ever! Friendly service. The prices are a little high but considering the food quality, totally worth it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were excited to try this new breakfast spot which is close to home and we found a winner!  LOVE the fresh squeezed orange juice with a free refill.  I had one of the specials, a ham, spinach and jack cheese omelet - delish!  My husband tried the pancakes (with Vermont REAL maple syrup) - also fabulous.  Reasonably priced - we will definitely be regulars here!"}
{"text":"Good mix of options and specials. Something for everyone. My El Paso omlete was excellent. Kids enjoyed the Hog Heaven omlete and french toast. SO much food. Super nice staff. Solid breakfast choice."}
{"text":"HOLY HAM STEAK!! This place is a true gem. 1 FREE REFILL on fresh OJ and very good ingredients make for a special dining event. At every breakfast place I ask for potatoes well done & 'almost burnt' and 99 times out of 100 they come to me either the same as they do for everyone or under-cooked!  Not at this place...they know how to fill an order as requested. See picture, look at those grill marks on the ham steak!  Give it a try, worth the wait on the weekends."}
{"text":"Tried to come here a couple weeks ago, saw the reviews, however wait was too long, so decided to give it another shot today.  Went around 12:45 and there was no wait!  So either go really early or later. 

Wanted to try so many things on the menu and couldn't make a decision. The waitress, Kimberly was absolutely so sweet and helpful! She was very patient. 

We had the ribeye steak and scrambled eggs - there's different options for sides, I went with pancakes and crispy hash! Usually I have to ask for the hash browns to be done crispy but this place had it perfect! The pancake has a sweet lemon flavor to it. I couldn't figure it out, but it clearly states that on the menu. 

We also had the French toast special which came with bacon and eggs. The sourdough French toast was also flavored with lemon zest, vanilla, and cinnamon! It was dipped and deep fried. Never had French toast like this before! It was amazing!!!

I didn't have the fresh squeezed orange juice but my company told me it taste so good and never had OJ that good and fresh before!

Now... I wish I could give this place 5 stars, but I was a little disappointed with the restroom. There was one restroom for each sex and it was a little unkept. I understand it may have been the end of the day for them since the place closes at 2pm and probably the brunch rush, however they could at least have more than one stall for a restaurant of that size! 

The decor and furniture are a little dated but at least it wasn't dirty.

We will definitely be returning to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Best place in town and the best chicken fried steak you can ever imagine a lot better than most places in the valley for anything. And I really liked the Decour. We also have the chili Quiles and they were really good. I also really like the freshly squeezed orange juice it's a also really fresh, also had refills.  French toast is moist and crispy not like most places like places where it's like you're eating cardboard. Coffee was also really delicious and fresh. Waiter was also really nice. This is our new breakfast spot. Me and my husband really loved it. We would totes recommend to others."}
{"text":"French toast was delicious but... Deep fried? I didn't expect that.  Coffee was good.  A little pricy for breakfast but overall good experience.  I'd love to go back and try the fresh baked items!"}
{"text":"5 adults and 3 children went here for breakfast... I'm glad we all had a great experience. The staff was very accommodating of our party and the food here was well worth the wait!! If your ever in the Phoenix or Scottsdale area this is a definite place you want to stop and eat.. On our next trip out here we will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"This place is do ply awesome, service is great, food selection great, a very busy place. Price is fair, they have food also for people who dont eat meat very accommodating. I found a new breakfast joint its a lil ways from me but its worth the drive....id definitely come bak. A must try, specially if ur vegan eeater. Five starzzz!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The fruit French toasts are amazing! Great potion sizes. Service is always good. Cash only, but that's not a problem-have a fee free ATM."}
{"text":"The hostess and wait staff were gracious and attentive. I had two eggs and bacon which were cooke perfectly but they were a side to the main attraction. I also had blueberry pancakes with lemon curd. What a great change for mornings flapjacks. The blueberries, lemon curd spread, and maple syrup were brilliant together. This was a great breakfast experience."}
{"text":"Fantastic local breakfast joint. Unpretentious and warm service. The 5 egg white scramble is good, but it is out of this world once you add the chorizos on it. Portions are monstrous so don't over do it. The El Paso omelette is also really good. Both came with sides of pancakes that have an awesome lemon zest taste. Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Great service, affordable pricing, everything is homemade. Try the omelettes and cinnamon roll"}
{"text":"Sadly I stopped eating here a few weeks ago. I really liked this place and the food was almost always good. After coming here several times a month the only complaint I have ever had is the temperature of the food. At times, when I came near closing time, my food came out cold or barely warm. Often the coffee had seen better days and I got a luke warm cup. Strangely it would often just be individual items of the plate of food. For example, just the breakfast meat, sometimes just the pancakes or even cold toast to the point the butter would not melted on the bread but the rest of the meal is hot. I would not complain if this only happened a few times. I do understand that the kitchen needs to start closing up but I feel the quality should be just as good as when they are busy in the mornings. As a customer I am not paying less at the end of the day for my meal so why does the quality suffer? Due to my restrictions on my lunch hour I used to like to come when they were slowing down. I made accommodations to go and get cash because they are a cash only business now and that didn't bother me. My server always fixed the problems by having whatever quickly warmed up (I'm not sure if they have a microwave) but it was definitely not remade so it really didn't taste as good as freshly prepared. The manager (a dark haired lady) was aware of the problems but never apologized or offered any compensation. She really seemed like my issues were an inconvenience for her to address. If she would have acknowledged the problems by speaking to me or offered me any type of compensation I would have felt better about my meals being not hot or even warm at times. I know this place has lots of business and loyal customers so I am sure they have not missed me eating there. It's just a shame because I really enjoyed my meals when they were prepared correctly."}
{"text":"Walked into the place with our 3 kids the second we opened the door they said hello and seated is immediately!! My wife and I both looked at one another and said wow. I would just like to note it's not like this place was empty, in fact it was packed yet when we sat they already had our high chair waiting!! Then we ordered and literally in the time it took them to get our drinks out the food was ready !! This place honestly should stop serving food and train every other Restraunt how to serve people as they have it figured out !! I would give this place 10 stars for cistomer service if I could !!"}
{"text":"We came here expecting the food to be amaaaazing. There was a long line, which was expected on a sunday afternoon. It took about 30 minutes to be seated. 
The service was fast and fair, but the food was mediocre in our opinion. I was not impressed at all. I am a breakfast/brunch lover too, so this was disappointing! Oh well, at least we gave it a try!"}
{"text":"Best place in the valley that I have been for breakfast or lunch. I have lived here for 30 + years. A couple of things to remember. 

1. If you decide to check this place out there will probably be a wait. To me people waiting outside = probably a good place.

2. Bring your appitite as not only are there many choices for breakfast or lunch the portions are ample.

3. Last but not least, Service with a smile.

I have been here 3 times in the last month. No signs of slowing down in the future. Maybe you will see me happily enjoying the que waiting to order the French Toast or Chicken Fried Chicken."}
{"text":"Now I know why this place is always loaded with people. It's amazing!

The banana pecan French toast was soooo good. Love they have Shriner's sausage. That stuff is the best. My friend had the chicken fried chicken and it looked amazing. 

The staff is great, friendly and love the tie dye shirts. The decor is cute. Oh and definitely try the cinnamon rolls."}
{"text":"The place was great! Greeted with 3 smiling faces and 1 already had menus and seated us right away. We went in at about 8/8:30am and they had quite a crowd, but not packed. Our food came out fast, coffee was really good. My boyfriend got the gooye scramble, which was really good. The pancakes have a hint of something In them that makes them different but GOOD, they are nice a fluffy. The toast was a little on the hard side though. Everything else was great, nice atmosphere with lots of natural light. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy. Blueberry lemon curd pancakes.  Yummy yummy yummy.  Nice atmosphere and quick service.  They make great coffee too"}
{"text":"Service is very good, food is consistently good and obviously fresh. They service people were friendly with my young children, which means a lot to me. The prices are very reasonable for the amount of food that you get."}
{"text":"This restaurant started in Michigan and all they serve is breakfast, but that is what you will want.  The fresh squeezed juices are incredible, but I leave that to my guests because I want to save the calories for their green chili eggs benedict.  It is truly one of my favorite dishes I have ever had for breakfast.  I like it so much, I want to spoon up the last of the sauce.  My wife always orders their 5 egg omelette and takes half home for lunch.  Two meals for the price of one.  Get a side a bacon if you consider yours of a a bacon expert.  It is thick and amazing a and you can take it home uncooked by the ten pound box!!"}
{"text":"Big portions and amazing service. The food was wonderful, had the El Paso omelette, it was delicious. You have to try the French toast, HUGE portion...we had the banana pecan and it was phenomenal. If this place was in Austin it would be our Sunday brunch place."}
{"text":"Really wonder place. First time there today with my husband. Our friend found it when she was out here through yelp and said for us to try it. So glad we did the cinnamon roll was to die for. I had the special which was seasonal pumpkin pancakes and my husband had the chicken fried steak. OMG so good. They also make their own strawberry jam! The service was excellent. Highly recommend you go here to have breakfast!"}
{"text":"Is it the food or the service?  Both!  What a combo. Best food around, served with a smile and a sincere wish for a good day for you and yours."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best breakfast places that I've been to. Great environment and they have something for everyone. Make sure you try the blueberry pancakes."}
{"text":"This is definitely on top of my list of favorite restaurants... Food and portions are awesome and the wait staff are very accommodating... Can't forget Theresa, she rocks! Highly recommend this place for sure..."}
{"text":"A group of seven of us went on Sunday morning, at the suggestion of a regular customer in our group.  My first impression was that the place was dingy and old looking - needs a significant  face lift!  Because of that, I expected that instead of spending money on remodeling they would give discounts for the lack of atmosphere - NOT SO!!  We eat out regularly and this place is more expensive than the Scottsdale breakfast places that we eat.  Another minus is one piece of toast with a breakfast.  COME ON!!  The least expensive part of the breakfast and they don't even provide two pieces, a standard???  

Now to the food.............they used cheap packaged ground bacon in the omelette that we ordered - looks and tastes like dog food!  Then we all made the mistake of ordering toast with breakfast and they just could NOT get their act together and get the toast on the table.  We ended up getting our toast to the table after we had finished our breakfast.  If a place that is a breakfast place can't get toast on the table with breakfast, where do you go from there.  Perhaps investment in a commercial toaster would help; the hostess says that they put their toast on the grill(??).  When we had several conversations with the hostess that we were unhappy about not having toast, it didn't seem to make a difference.  We really expected to see the manager/owner come to our table and at least apologize - NOPE!!

Our friend that is a regular was really embarrassed that things went so badly.  NEVER AGAIN!!  As we were leaving, there were several people outside waiting for a table.  I wanted to advise them that there are MUCH better places for breakfast:  the Breakfast Joint, Butters, Perk Eatery, the Breakfast Club; and they are also cheaper with better quality of food."}
{"text":"Been here twice this vacation. We like it a lot. It's great quality and quantity of food. Hubby had the banana crunch oatmeal both times and I had huevos rancheros - so good and today just having boring but yummy poached eggs."}
{"text":"I came here at the recommendation of a friend at work.  I started with a bottled iced coffee they have here called Cortez Coffee Co. Which is a Sumantran coffee. Very rich, dark, and flavorful.  I had the El Paso Omelette. For a choice of bread they offered sourdough, white, wheat, or pancakes......yes two pancakes as your bread choice. I got the sourdough. Because I didn't want to feel like a fatty, although I am one.

The El Paso has a generous amount of of chorizo which I was happy to see because most restaurants can be stingy with it. It also comes with cheddar cheese, black beans, and green chilies.  Surprisingly it's not as spicy as you would expect.  

The service was very friendly. We were greeted within second of walking into the place and were sat quickly.  Keep in mind we came at 9am so the traffic is very low.  Our server was helpful and helped me identify a spice that I loved in the chorizo.

Overall I will be returning to this place for breakfast.  It's a bit of a drive for me, but I like it here."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my favorite breakfast restaurants. Food and service are always on point. I highly recommend the pancakes or pastries!"}
{"text":"Great place !!! Food is great and OJ aid fresh.
Best way to start your day.
Organic and fresh"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in this area for sure. On weekends you will have to wait but trust me when I say that it is worth the wait!  Th nenyuitems are made from locally scourges ingredients. Everything tastes soooooo fresh and ohhhh the flavors! My favorite items are breakfast I love the French toast and I love the chicken fried steak and eggs. Seriously makes me salivate just writing about it now! Do yourself a favor and go and try it out."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!!  GREAT food and everyone is super friendly!!!  We come here at least twice a week!!!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"}
{"text":"While visiting Phoenix we were looking for a breakfast place on our first morning.  Found this place on Yelp and thought we would give it a try due to the good reviews.
They were busy, always a good sign.  We were sat pretty quickly and our server was very friendly.
The food was wonderful!  Their orange juice was fresh squeezed and amazing.  My son and husband had pancakes and they both enjoyed them.  Their sausage was high quality and very good.  I had the fried French Toast and it was delicious!!!
Overall HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast  I had biscuits, eggs, and sausage and my wife had the pancakes- everything was delicious. Made fresh from locally sourced. Service was friendly and quick. We were in Phoenix for the Memorial Day weekend and this was by far our favorite breakfast."}
{"text":"There's typically a 15-20 minute wait when we come in on Sundays, but that's to be expected. Servers are quick and friendly, the pancakes are fluffy and have a hint of lemon zest which is so good! 

My only disappointment is the limited menu. The omelets have kinda weird ingredients and are very, very rich. Before going, I'd definitely give it a once over to make sure it has something you'll like.

You get your bill and pay up at the entrance, so the turnover is pretty quick. Very good and efficient!"}
{"text":"Found this place using the Yelp! App trusting its rating. 

Turns out, Yelpers are right. 

This place was seamless with service. 

Very quick to get seated, very quick to get our drinks, after taking our food order it came very quickly. 

Most importantly, the food was hot, and very good. 

If your on the area and want some good breakfast. Give them a try!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing; I had the Christmas pancakes(spice and apple pancakes topped with bananas, dried cranberries and pecans) and the ham and cheddar omelette. The server was quick and courteous and attentive(Andrea?) and the fresh squeezed OJ was amazing, albeit expensive. I only wish I had room to try the brioche cinnamon rolls."}
{"text":"Went to OBH for our 4th of July breakfast. Had not been for awhile and was in for a great surprise. My friend had the Popeye Omelet and I the Choc Chip and raspberry pancakes. Wow what a meal. The omelet and hash browns were great.
I had to have half of it. Mine was also good but the omelet won the contest. 
Very friendly and speed service. 
Will be back soon. Will be trying the Friday fish fry soon. 
Glad to have this diamond in my backyard."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant is amazing.  Service: beyond great and with a smile the entire time
Food: Delicious and fast
Environment:  clean and inviting"}
{"text":"Delicious home cooked meals that always please. the crab omelet is delectable and the fresh made cornedbeef hash is amazing. .. even the jam for your thick sliced toast is fabulous."}
{"text":"The wait staff is always on top of things and work as a team to make sure everything is taken care of. Blondie and I usually make this our breakfast date place. I wish the bacon, asparagus, and goat cheese scramble was a regular item. However I understand that they only want to use produce that is in season to make sure it's always perfect. Still... it's sooo good! I don't really understand why people are going so crazy about the cash only thing, you just pay with cash instead of a card, no big deal. The only thing that slowly deters us is the wait when the snowbirds come into town. Our gem of a local breakfast joint has been discovered by all."}
{"text":"Don't even know where to begin! The environment is amazing and brings back lots of mementoes of Hawaii and a laid back and festive atmosphere. I ordered the pecan and banana pancakes and the Popeye (an omelette that has mushrooms and spinach) and my wife ordered eggs, home style fries and an amazing piece of French toast that is more cinnamon roll amazingness. The eggs were light and fluffy and not only appeared awesome but had a very light flavor that leaves you wanting more. The pancakes were the same amazing and I am not a pancake person, but to say I love the ones I was served would be an understatement and that was after eating the first round of meal and having no space left! I would give this place 6 stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Great food ! Only down fall is it's constantly packed and have to wait in line forever . Country fried steak and biscuit and gravy were awesome!"}
{"text":"Strawberry French toast with eggs and bacon was so good! I loved their real oj!! Wait sucked and it was hot ! But kinda worth, kinda passed out from the heat lol"}
{"text":"You wouldn't expect a place that looks like this would have the best food. But didn't anyone ever tell you never judge a book by its cover? So many good choices to choose from for a decent price and a good amount of food! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Five stars, every time! My family eats here every weekend. My husband loves the chilaquiles and green chile pork omelette. I love the egg white scramble. My daughter is a bacon aficionado and has given her approval. 

All the staff members are friendly, genuine and attentive. We honestly feel like family when we come in every week. Please keep up the great work and fantastic service!"}
{"text":"My family went to OBH for breakfast two weeks ago.  There was a 15 minute wait but it wasn't so bad.  Our waitress was sweet and great.  The food portions are big!  My husband ordered the chicken fried chicken and loved it.  I ordered the El Paso omelette and it was tasty.  We live in the far west valley and made a special trip to check this place out.  We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast to start my vacation, couldn't be happier about it! Fresh squeezed juice, homemade jam and sourdough bread. Ordered the pork chop breakfast special and everything was cooked perfectly. 
But I am genuinely excited to come back as they have linguisa on the menu- are you kidding me? Until Winco came to town it was hard to find Silvas to remind me of home. Now I can come here and it is an item on the menu-Awesome..
Great spot-must try!"}
{"text":"I have really nothing to say but if you don't eat here, you're missing out. Best breakfast ever. Service is fast and fantastic. Lemon hinted pancakes?! YES PLEASE."}
{"text":"Very very Quiant, as for the food excellent. Looks like we found our weekend brunch spot."}
{"text":"We order a chorizo burrito and French toast. All of  which was very very tasty & a lot spicy( which I was not made aware of, my waitress didn't specify nor is there a sign to tell you, other than the fact that it was chorizo) also sitting in a little puddle of green chile sauce which made my burrito a little soggy. the French toast is delicious and really one of a kind it's crispy like friend ice cream, I would highly recommend to anybody. The staff was friendly and it was an overall good experience. Only downside was that also our table was small and cluttered. We had a pitcher of water, two cups, sugar basket, hot sauce, salt and pepper plus a jar of sugar. 
There has to be a better way to organize that, but that won't stop us from ordering French toast.(:"}
{"text":"Wow! Got off an early flight and came here starved. Waited about 20 minutes and totally worth the wait. Huge portions and very yummy. Fresh squeezed OJ. Super friendly and efficient staff. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Love the food, love the staff, have never had a bad experience. 
We love this place so much, we had them cater breakfast at our evening wedding in November 2013. John and staff went out of their way to make brinner a wonderful part of our nuptials. 
I can't say enough good things about this place."}
{"text":"this is hands down the best French toast I've ever had. the service is amazing - wish I could live to eat here everyday. this place is like a warm blanket on a cold day... love it!"}
{"text":"A great breakfast place very friendly staff and managers. The food is all amazing my only wish was that they had a eggs Benedict. Fresh squeezed oj and not over priced. Small restaurant expect to wait during peak hours."}
{"text":"A lot of high sugar and fried foods on the menu, but a great selection, especially the French toast. Hubs and I have tried this place a couple times but i have to say not found anything that knocked my socks off. Bisquits and gravy was just ok and it's a staple for my judging of a breakfast place. Service was good, but there is almost always a wait on the weekends."}
{"text":"What an amazing breakfast spot! Love the food and service is excellent! On the weekend there is a long wait. The food is unique and yummy! However they do offer classic food too!"}
{"text":"The French toast tastes just like a cross between an elephant ear and fry bread. Delicious.  Share it because it's like dessert.  We had the El Paso omelette with chorizo.  Tasty as well."}
{"text":"This place is always popping!! But don't let the long lines fool you - service is quick and friendly - you'll see the wait dwindle down quickly and next thing you know you're at your table! Fresh ingredients are always used and Orange juice is squeezed fresh daily. I've only tried their breakfast menu and the portions are huge and delicious."}
{"text":"Omg everything here is super delicious!!! Cash only but they have a free ATM. Their French toast is to die for. They are also locally sourced and organic when possible."}
{"text":"This is a really great place to take out-of-town guests. Everything is so delicious, from the omelets to the pancakes to the chorizo burritos. High-quality ingredients (like grass fed and finished Arizona beef) at affordable prices. They serve fresh-squeezed orange juice with a free refill. The cinnamon rolls are to die for. Just make sure to take cash out first as they don't accept credit cards (but they do have a nearby ATM)."}
{"text":"We have eaten here on multiple occasions and have never been disappointed. The quality of food and service are top.  Can't say to pick one particular item over another because everything has been great so far. Hey do have specials each weekend for folks to try or order off the menu.  Either way you can't go wrong.  You will leave happy and full and looking forward to your next trip here."}
{"text":"Every meal here has been enjoyable and fantastic! Always great service,get there early on weekends... The wait is  comfortable and worthwhile. Gluten-free options are amazing (hear the angels sing)! Love the decor... Only drawback is it gets a bit loud as noise carries well."}
{"text":"Very cute, very good service, also the raspberry chocolate chip pancakes and the cinnamon rolls are anazing"}
{"text":"Noms. This place is an adorable local spot. We went for brunch on a Sunday morning. There was a short wait, but we got in pretty fast and service was excellent. I appreciate that they have gluten free banana pecan pancakes - so yummy! We all had something different - pancakes, scrambles, omelettes, french toast, burger - and we all loved our meal. TONS of food, I don't think anyone was able to finish theirs. 

Only complaint would probably be that it's $2.50 for coffee. This isn't Starbucks. But everything else is well priced and delicious!"}
{"text":"The inside isn't much to write home about, but the food and service are Amazing. I order the \"San Francisco style\" French toast, which have a hint of lemon and are flash fried after being cooked the normal way. So they've got a mildly crisp outside and tender on the inside. Incredible. 
The service was wonderful, we were checked up on often and never ran out of coffee. 
Tucked away and almost easy to miss, I have to highly recommend a stop here. The place was busy when we arrived and busy when we left. I can see why."}
{"text":"Delicious homestyle food! \"Just like moms\" is the best way I can describe it. Friendly and relaxed atmosphere worth the drive every time."}
{"text":"Not a bad wait for Sunday brunch. There is an ample and comfortable waiting area outside the restaurant. Our waitress Andrea was genuinely friendly and made us feel at home. Very comfortable atomspere. Our breakfast was delicious! Served hot and in a timely manner. Nice selection of unique dishes. This is the kind of place you go back to time after time!"}
{"text":"Me and my bf tried the same El Paso omelette and we got 2 different things. It was inconsistent on the hash browns. I got like 1/4 of hash brown of what he got and his order was wrong. They left out couple ingredients. The guac was old. The chorizo was good mine was tasty the service was great . I don't let the quality of the food interfere with the service which is why we tipped. Also BIG issue which why we gave 3 stars was because of hygiene.
 They never used gloves. The owner kept walking in the kitchen and helping out with ready to eat food but no gloves ? I mean that's gross. The servers and boh staff needed hair nets and the waitresses had their hair all messy. Also the girls soon fresh orange juice. Same , no gloves , It wasn't nice to look at .. That was the main reason why I gave 3 stars they need to work on their hygiene a lot . Hopefully they change it because it might affect their business regardless of the food is great"}
{"text":"As I eye my empty plate...the ingredients are all fresh and loca. Every dish had the fullest freshest, lightest feel to it. 
Best breakfast I've had anywhere...ever.
( Drop the microphone)"}
{"text":"This place had great service. The server was very professional and did her job well. The food was okay. The reason for three stars is that the bathroom smelled so bad of sewer that my son could not go to the bathroom because we gagged so Much. We finally had to walk next door to the gas station to use their bathroom. Hopefully they can get that figured out."}
{"text":"Never really been in this area of town but yelped to find some breakfast and what a good find! My huevos rancheros were delicious and the green sauce that came on them was very tasty and slightly spicy. I loved it and would definitely order it again. Sorry no pics, it didn't last long on the plate. 
We also had the Cajun andouille scramble that they had for the daily special and my boyfriend absolutely loved it. He's actually Cajun, so I think that gives it some validation that it was legitimate Cajun goodness. 
Never heard of this place before, but close enough to home that we will come again. 

The service was the best I've had in a long time. They had great attention to detail on the orders! Everyone was very helpful and such a positive friendly environment."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot for good fresh food. Staff is friendly and responsive. Only down side is it's a cash only establishment"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, very cozy and retro. 

This is great hidden gem that we were surprised how good the food is."}
{"text":"French toast was pretty bomb! Deep fried tried chorizo burrito a little spicy but good flavor. Overall great service and cute spot"}
{"text":"Ok, second time here, and this place is legit! The orange juice is fresh, they squeezed it ten minutes ago. 
Everything here is natural and delicious. We keep bringing in different people and they all love it!"}
{"text":"Great local food... local ingredients... crowded but you can pass yoo the lines if the counter is open.  Counter is a bit NOISEY but outs a great place to people watch. Had the simple eggs and sausages which were fantastic."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Sunday morning. Place was packed, lots of people waiting but we got in fast! Cinnamon roll was the best I've ever had! Service was excellent. Carafe of coffee and water. Brought my husband iced tea before he was half empty 3x. Ordered chicken fried steak, yum!  The owner was right there in the mix, bussing tables, calling parties. The wait staff looked happy. Decor was cute, collection of metal lunch pales."}
{"text":"On this road trip it was well liked in Yelp. I visited the place and was not disappointed. After a long wait we enjoyed great meals with great service. I understood why people were willing to wait. The optional sides include pancakes!  Large portions too."}
{"text":"Pretty good! :-)
Mom got the Green Chile Omelette & liked it! :-)
I got the blackberry pancakes & they were yummy! :-)
Only thing that bugged me was that the \"pancake special\" was offered to me, which adds 2 bacon/sausage & 2 eggs. I'm allergic to eggs, so I asked if they could drop the eggs & double the bacon. I was told they'd check. Brought pancakes & 3 bacon (not 4). Bill came & pancakes & bacon were charged separately. Not real pleased by that, but otherwise good place!

Nice place & staff! :-)

P.S.,
The bacon was pretty thick & crisp, which is how I like it, so that was really good! Even minus a piece :-P haha"}
{"text":"This place has been in business for 4 years and already has 900 reviews. There is a reason for it. We came on Saturday of Memorial Day weekend with a party of 8. Wait time we were told would be 20-25 minutes. With the huge line of people outside we questioned that. I set the stopwatch. 22 minutes later we were sat! 
Now onto the food. Eight people, eight reviews in one word each. 1: French toast with eggs and bacon- delicious. 2: cinnamon roll pancakes- so-good. 3: blueberry pancakes - fantastic. 4: pancakes and bacon - a little to good. 5: cinnamon roll pancakes with a side of bacon- rich. 6: cheesy eggs - eggcellent. 7: chicken fried chicken with eggs and French toast- underpricedheaven. 8: linguica and cheddar scramble - fantastic. 
Bottom line is John who greeted us at the table has really got something here. I worry that his prices are just too low though. Nice to have met you John and remember always trust a fat guys review! Lol. 
This is my family's new favorite breakfast spot!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I eat breakfast a couple of times and everything was great. We were greeted with smiles and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!!! Food is always great, service is quick and servers are friendly!! Whenever I have people in from out of town I always bring them here and there have been no complaints yet!! There are times when I wish they were open later but why ruin a good thing when it works so well. You have to get there early to avoid the long lines but would still recommend waiting because their food is just that great!!"}
{"text":"Super delicious and a great variety of breakfast and brunchy items.  Only thing that kinda sucks is that it is so good and popular that there is almost always a wait. Not much room inside to wait so hot to wait outside in the summer"}
{"text":"Great food awesome french toast tasty food coffee simply awesome great service and people also will be back!"}
{"text":"The El Paso omelet is Soo good!! Just note that it will still be spicy even if you remove the green chilies! The spiceness is in the chorizo! 

Service is pretty good too! The servers are sweet. 

Thank you for a tasty breakfast"}
{"text":"Came into a packed house during peak business hours and was seated right away. There's a lot of tables and so as a result a little loud, this doesn't bother us as we want good food and noise isn't an issue. Our order was taken straight away as soon as we sat. I looked at my watch just out of curiosity to see how long it would take when this place was clearly packed. 12 minutes later our food was brought out. Both meals were on point and devoured quickly. Just as soon as we were done the check was dropped off. The quickness of this staff was very out of the ordinary and we appreciated it. We will be back no doubt. There's a reason this place is so highly reviewed."}
{"text":"Wow, this place has some unique items that you won't find anywhere else.  I really liked that.  I had the chicken fried steak and deep fried French toast and it was tasty.  I've never had FT deep fried and it was worth it.  My mom had an egg breakfast.  We were pleasantly filled up.  We had a 10 or 15 minute wait on a weekend day.   Love the tie-dye shirts that the employees wear.  The have Triple Berry French Toast which I am dying to try.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The breakfast is definitely yum but, not exceptional. I'm not sure if it was worth the 30+ minutes wait. However, service was really good: fast and pleasant. Our server came to check on us multiple times, she also brought my OJ refill without me asking. 

I got the pancake special which includes 2 pancakes, 2 eggs and a side of bacon or sausage. I got the raspberry chocolate chip pancakes which were good but just a little too sweet for my palate. Next time, I would try their banana and pecan waffle which looks good. 

The freshly squeezed Orange juice which comes with a free refill is totally worth it. It does have some pulp which I don't mind but I'm sure you could ask them to strain it if desired. 

I would definitely return but probably go earlier so I am not waiting for that long. So far there's only one breakfast place in the Phx/Scottsdale area I would wait for up to an hour for breakfast."}
{"text":"Saw the great reviews on Yelp and Foursquare, figured we would check this place out. Ordered the cinnamon roll, strawberry french toast, pancakes, and bacon/eggs. Unfortunately, nothing really stood out as super impressive. Staff was very friendly. Overall good experience, but probably wouldn't be a destination breakfast joint for us."}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday morning. Unfortunately we weren't wowed. We thought we could have done just as well at home or at IHOP. It also was a long wait to get in."}
{"text":"The Best of Everything is here!! Costa Rican coffee, freshly baked piping hot Cinnamon Rolls, Farm Fresh Farmer's Omelette with just-picked Zucchini, warm biscuits, homemade Strawberry jam, too!  

I spied homemade Pop Tarts and Muffins in the Bakery case, too!

This restaurant will surely always satisfy the most ravenous eaters!"}
{"text":"Came to Phoenix for a couple days and I had bookmark this breakfast place. 

This place is really busy. Yet my boyfriend and I 
had a great experience. Our server was amazing. I forgot her name but I know she's German and Filipino, she was very attentive.

I had ordered the chicken fried steak with a gluten free banana muffin and I believe my boyfriend ordered the 5 egg white omelette with a gluten free banana pecan pancake. Everything was really good."}
{"text":"The service was excellent and friendly. The food was plentiful and tasty and the coffee was good. I had the Huevos Rancheros and hubby had the Biscuits and Gravy. We both had only coffee to drink - no juice. My problem is: over $30 for breakfast for two people is unrealistic to me. Nothing bad about the place, just not my style, therefore, the 3 stars."}
{"text":"Seriously my favorite breakfast spot!! The French Toast is the best in town. The portions are huge and they serve Cortez coffee! The staff is so friendly and attentive! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The French toast is amazing. Been here several times and hasn't failed. Great prices- nice staff. Usually a wait on the wknds but moves quickly. Doesn't look like much from the outside but it's relaxed environment. I can see myself be coming back many more times."}
{"text":"Great service once we got to our table.  We waited around 20 minutes to be seated - not bad for Sunday morning.  They have a great variety of good food.  I'll certainly return even though it's a bit of a drive for me."}
{"text":"Don't let  the wait fool you. Very timely and the food was great! I have chicken fried chicken with French toast. It was very delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere! Nice shaded area with free ice cold water while you wait. We were a party of 3 and we're seated less than 10 minutes.  Our service was great, prompt, and full of smiles. Our food was wonderfully presented and tasted soooo good! Huge portions so plan to share or take home tho it's so good you may want to just stuff your bellies. Cash only but no fear they have an ATM that's free that's right no charges. We Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"When there for breakfast on  Sunday the place was packed we had a 45 minute wait but it was well worth it the staff was great service was fast and the food was amazing.
Their signature dish the chicken fried chicken was amazing it came with the French toast which was great the gravy has a very very unique twist on it.
The fresh squeezed oranges is great very refreshing.
Will definitely be back in 100% sure that I will recommend to friends and family"}
{"text":"Fantastic homestyle breakfast. The biscuits and gravy made me see the face of god. I really enjoyed my time here."}
{"text":"It's jolly good! Unpretentious dining place. I want a good and local place for breakfast or brunch - here it is! Tasty menu (pancakes !) and reasonable prices. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Phoenix/Scottsdale 
Fresh squeezed OJ is awesome! The food is always fresh and delicious"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great breakfast here this morning. The service was quick and the food was very tasty. Our server, Brittany, was very attentive and super pleasant. We got seated immediately however, it did get very busy and got very loud but that didn't take anything away from the good food and great service. Thanks Brittany!"}
{"text":"We are coming here from out of town for the first time and the food was very good, especially the chicken fried chicken and the raspberry cream crepes. Everything was fresh and they were good sized portions. Our server was very nice."}
{"text":"What a quirky little place!!

We had breakfast during memorial weekend and were quickly seated.

The interior is nothing fancy-some quirky decorations and simple tables and booths.

Staff was really nice and attentive.

I had the omlette special which was great. Coffee was really good, and I was happy to see they had non dairy ID creamer cups as well as half and half.

The kids menu was fine and food reasonably priced.

Food was a little slow to get to us, but the restaurant was full; we didn't mind the wait.

We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Ok...  Second time visiting this place.  BEST BREAKFAST in the world!!!!  I ordered chicken and French toast but they accidentally brought me just French toast.  When I asked about it she said you're right we brought you the wrong thing.  The owner personally brought me the correct order and left the original order (no I didn't eat it all but I wanted to)...  Super friendly staff and some very delicious selections.  I guess they're know for their French toast and it is amazing - maybe better than Juniors in NYC - certainly just as good!!!  They don't take credit cards but that's no biggie for me.  Older place that seems to have some history...  Anyway, I'd fly here just to come here!!!"}
{"text":"Searched and searched for a good breakfast place in Phoenix, and this kept coming up on top of everyone's list. It did not disappoint!! I had this incredible fried chicken/french toast combo, and it was incredible. Met up with a friend (we were both visiting Phoenix from out of state) and her two kids, and we ALL loved what we had. Tons of choices, FANTASTIC service (very knowledgeable and friendly server!). Will definitely go back when I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Living in the neighborhood for so long I was surprised I had not seen this earlier. Happened to drive by it one day so I looked it up on Yelp to find good reviews.

We decided to stop in and try it and it lived up to the reputation. Food was good. Coffee was good. Staff were friendly. It's a nice place. We shall return."}
{"text":"Food is always fresh, coffee is delish and fresh squeeze juices are among the best around..."}
{"text":"Very best breakfast I've ever had! Portions were so enormous! Everything about my experience was awesome, my husband who is very picky about his food also loved it. Will be going here a lot from now on."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place, it was excellent, place was packed but for good reason, the food was great and service was outstanding. We came from out of town and waitress was very helpful and friendly and offered up some good suggestions. I recommend the chicken fried chicken covered in sausage gravy with the French toast, all natural ingredients."}
{"text":"Great service fantastic food.  They make fresh squeezed orange juice EVERYDAY!  The portions are large and the food is made fresh, nothing comes from frozen.  If you want a real home-cooked breakfast this is the place."}
{"text":"Went out with the family for some breakfast at a place we had never had. A quick search on yelp and we landed at Original Breakfast House.

When we arrived they were also having a car show in the parking lot and parking was very difficult, almost left, but we ended up parking across the street. Place was packed which in my eyes is a good sign, after about a thirty min wait for a party of three we were seated.

My wife and I got menus and our five year old got nothing, I do not believe they have a kids menu. My wife got the El Paso omelette. The serving size is huge and on top of that it comes with hash browns and two pancakes! My daughter got the pancake special and she absolutely loved it. I ended up going with Juan's tacos and I highly recommend it. Price per person was under $10, and portion sizes were awesome. 

Place is relatively small but you have enough room to enjoy your meal and your company, with the lack of size it can be a tad bit noisy but don't let that keep you away. Great experience and great food we will definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"So i decided to come here based off the reviews. Oh my was i surprised i was going to like this place. Menu is pretty simple, but the food on the other hand was far from simple. The food was amazing, i truly enjoyed my meal and im not much of a breakfast person. The food sat good throughout the day with me and i didnt have that yucky breakfast food coma that i mostly get from other places. The food here was so rich and different, i almost crave it again and i just had it a few hours ago. ALSO SIDE NOTE: THEY HAVE GLUTEN FREE PANCAKES. So for you gluten free people, they do cater to you as well! Please give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service.  We had chicken fried steak, fried chicken sandwhich, cheeseburger and vegetable omlette.  All were excellent.  Service was spot on and we met the owner on site.

A must visit if in the area."}
{"text":"Food was cold and when we paid cash we had to go ask for our change back. She said oh ya I forgot!!! Not in a hurry to go back for sure."}
{"text":"Second time around was much better. There was a bit of a wait but that's to be expected on a Sunday morning. 

We were seated and my friend got the chicken fried steak  and eggs and I got the ribeye and steak. It came with toast which we upgraded to French toast and hash browns. We asked for the hash browns to be crispy. 
The food came out and the hash browns were perfectly crispy. My steak was nice and juicy and big. I didn't like my eggs, there's just something about them. but I'm not a big fan of eggs in general. The freakin French toast tho...I don't know what to say. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the French toast. We were def more satisfied this time. 

I used my voucher that John sent. He came over and asked us if it was good. I thought that was very nice and sincere. And the fact that he even sent me a voucher in the first place was very nice. It shows that he truly cares about his place of business. 

I will be back. How can I not? Have you not seen the French toast!!? Yum!"}
{"text":"I would prefer to give it 3.5 stars, but alas that isn't possible, but I don't think it only deserves 3. It's your basic Little breakfast diner that is serving decent diner food. Don't come here for a gourmet breakfast, but it is good. We waited for 40 minutes for a seat, so I assumed the food was going to be amazing. I got the chicken fried steak and it was pretty good, but required hot sauce for some needed flavor. It seemed like it was freshly made not a pre made frozen brick. I think I will try it again and get something new, maybe I'll like it even more."}
{"text":"was here today and let me tell you it was yummy ha the chicken fried steak special with has-browns and it was delish my mom had the popeye omelet and it was to di for cant wait to be back and try more stuff..."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for quite a while. It's a bit of a drive for us, so when husband and I were both in that area of town for different reasons, we decided to meet there for breakfast. He was delayed (like well over an hour and a half) but Teresa took such great care of me I didn't even mind! The manager even came by 'cause she was worried I might have been stood up! Lol! He'd of been in trouble since I know where he lives... Anyway, we really enjoyed everything we tried, and the people there were truly delightful. Thank you guys for taking such good care of me! We'll be back."}
{"text":"Color me impressed. This place was a little hard to find, but after going there I consider it to be our hidden gem. The food was all prepared fresh (even the biscuit and the jam that came with it!). I think it is also worth mentioning that when they say they have fresh-squeezed orange juice they MEAN IT (unlike some other places I've been...).  Not only was the food fresh and delicious, the service was excellent.  Despite the fact we arrived right at peak hours and the place was packed, the service did not suffer.  As if all of that wasn't enough motivation to come back, when I got the bill I was blown away. The prices are VERY reasonable especially for the quality of food you receive. This is our new breakfast spot and I would highly recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times and have been impressed on every occasion.  I can't remember what we've all gotten in the past but everyone in our party raved about how good it was.  We will keep coming back..."}
{"text":"OBH is the nearest legit breakfast/brunch place in the 85050 area code. I always order something different and am never disappointed. I've had their omelettes, French toast, chicken fried chicken, pancakes, and many other dishes. Service is great and homey. The wait is pretty nuts on weekends so prepare for 30 minute wait time, minimum. The price tag is super reasonable with just about everything under $15. Def a must if you're in the area."}
{"text":"The El Paso omelette was so tasty. I ordered it with a scone and took it to go for my next breakfast. Portion sizes are pretty big so many can get two meals out of the one. I tried the sausage gravy. I wasn't sure I like it at the first bite but after the second I was sold.  I had to mention the coffee - was very smooth. 
The wait staff were so friendly. This is a gem in the desert - be sure to stop by if you are looking for a real authentic breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Met my dad and sister there for brunch.  They had highly recommended the resturant.  I am from the south so I judge a good breakfast based on it's biscuits and gavy.  Unfortunately their's did not measure up.  However the serving sizes were impressive.  My sister and dad enjoyed their breakfasts though.  Next time I'm just going to go for the pancakes.  I hear they are awesome."}
{"text":"Loved it here!  The staff was friendly, the food was great, and not enough can be said about that orange juice!

I came in on a Saturday morning at about 9:30 and had no trouble finding two spots at the counter.  The waitress quickly greeted us and by looking on Yelp beforehand I knew I had to try the orange juice.  Sitting at the counter I was able to watch this stuff get fresh squeezed right in front of me before getting poured into my glass!  It's thick and pulpy and has just the right amount of sweetness.  It's on the pricey side but you do get a refill, which came at the perfect time when my meal arrived.

I had the El Paso omelet with chorizo, black beans, sour cream, guacamole, and pico de gallo.  The three egg omelet was stuffed with what I considered to be very good chorizo.  Next time I'll ditch the black beans, but I enjoyed having the guacamole and sour cream to put on top.  I didn't realize I could get both home fries AND pancakes with my omelet.  Needless to say, I had to waddle myself out of the restaurant after scarfing that all down!  Such is life...

From the time I sat down to the time I paid and left totaled about 40 minutes, which is ideal for a Saturday morning breakfast.  The crowd waiting outside at about 10:15 was pretty big, so I'd recommend coming earlier if you can roll out of bed that early."}
{"text":"Great service.. Tried this place when i was in town.. The Oj was amazing (fresh squeezed) and the special that i had was great as well.. Would definately recommend"}
{"text":"$3.50 for fresh squeezed OJ with 1 free refills.

Their french toast is AMAZING...Sour dough bread dipped in egg and deep fried.  The result is a firmer french toast (not as soggy as the traditional style). It's a must order even if you don't care for French toast or sour dough. This place had successfully converted many of my friends, including myself."}
{"text":"It was my first time going here for breakfast and I will be coming back. The service was great and the pricing was also a plus.

I had huevos rancheros but also tried the cinnamon rolls, the homemade orange juice, and the pancakes. All tasted delicious, I cannot wait to try more!"}
{"text":"Great banana nut pancakes!  The people are friendly and the atmosphere cheery.  Great casual setting and good food!"}
{"text":"Got 11 bucks?  Go get yourself an El Paso Omelette from the OBH on 32nd street and Thunderbird.  That dish is THE BEST BREAKFAST FOR $12 in the Paradise Valley, North Phoenix area.

This omelet is filled with chorizo, roasted green chilies, tomato, onion, black beans, and cheddar cheese.  It comes with guacamole, pico de gallo and sour cream on the side + Pancakes + Hashbrowns.  All for $12, WHAAAAT!? 

Seriously best brunch in a 5 mile radius.  Drop whatever you're doing and go get it now."}
{"text":"Could not be happier that we decided to try OBH. Everything was so good, the service, the food, the menu selection all awesome. Had the biscuits and gravy along with the fried chicken and French toast (their signature item) and without a doubt it's the best French toast we've ever had. Everything is made from scratch, they source locally, use organic produce and you can tell at the first bite. This spot is one of the best breakfast spots in the valley no doubt about it."}
{"text":"Food was great and portions were large bus I loved that their food is organic and from local growers. Service was a little slow but that was probably because it was SUPER busy and crowded when we first got there, but it was certainly worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The pictures looked great and given several of the reviews, I was really looking forward to visiting OBH. It was mediocre at best. Hopefully I was just there on a bad day. There were only a few tables with customers at 7 AM  and one waitress. Just nothing special at all. The gravy on the side for $1.50 would have filled a shot glass and not much more.

 The highlight of the meal was the hot sauce sitting on the table. I have used this sauce before (made in Gilroy, CA the garlic capital of the world, but a pepper base) and have not seen it for about 3 or 4 years, it was excellent."}
{"text":"Wow! This is a breakfast restaurant on steroids.   The food is big (portions), the selection is humongous, the calorie count of most dishes is super high, and so is the flavor!

Prices are reasonable, really about Denny's level. Bambi & I ate, & ate & ate for $25.

I don't give out 5 star ratings liberally, this place earned my highest recommendation."}
{"text":"This place is like one of those little diners in the midwest. traditional unhealthy breakfasts made JUST RIGHT. I had the french toast and it was 2 HUGE slices smothered in butter and syrup. It was awesome. 

I want to go back and try the homemade shakes and their lunch menu. 

This place is not a healthfood joint. But if you grew up in the midwest anywhere, you will enjoy a little slice of home with these breakfasts!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting and waiting to try Original Breakfast House for a really long time but never had the time. Lucky me I was able to make it today. I drove right by it even when I knew where it was. The front is facing the parking lot and the side is facing 32nd street. 

Walked in and it seemed very casual. The decor is hard to describe. I would have to say homie. Staff is homie wearing normal clothes and nothing to separate them from customer. Unique. Anyways, we were greeted right away, seated with a smile, and our waitress welcomed us right away. Very nice. 

We started off with their freshly squeezed orange juice. Room temperature with the pulp. Really good. Loved it. You also get one free refill. Make sure you get the refill. 

I realized that all these breakfast joints are all the same but what separates the good one from the great ones is their pancakes and French toast. Couldn't figure out which one to get today so I ordered the pancake special with blueberry pancakes, eggs, and sausage. I got two huge pancakes with blueberries inside and on top with maple syrup. Excellent pancakes. Nice fluffy. Really tasty with fresh blueberry. Couldn't ask for more. The eggs were good and the sausages thick and juicy. Really good breakfast. 

My son had the Hog Heaven omelette. It had sausage, bacon, and ham with cheddar cheese. Very surprised he ordered a omelette but then again it had bacon and he loves bacon. He told me that it was really good. He's a very picky eater so when he says it's good then it must be really good. 

Service was excellent. They already have a small jar of cold water at the table so you don't have to worry about refills. Only have to worry about orange juice refills which is a must. She was always asking us how are food was and kept an eye on us which was really good. 

So overall this was really good. Excellent food, excellent service, and homie atmosphere. What else could you ask for. For sure I'll be back again to try their San Francisco style French Toast. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Wow! Just tried this place for the first time!  We've lived down the street from OBH for 6 years!!!
Breakfast sandwich was AWESOME!  LOADED and delicious. Must go back and try omlettes and scrambles."}
{"text":"Really high quality food and well prepared. Great coffee and pastries. Breakfast is my favorite meal and this place is now my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the wait, first time going and we would definitely go back! The food was delicious, the pancakes were my favorite sooo good! Everything was really good and food came out super quick after we ordered. I wish I would have tried their cinnamon rolls they looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Excellent.  Creative food combinations that you just rarely see at other restaurants. Service is excellent and very friendly. There is an amazing canopied area where you can sit in case you're waiting in line."}
{"text":"This place is my JAM!! Surfer vibe with great eats.  I love their machaca burritos, french toast, pancakes, and fresh squeezed OJ.  Love their California hot sauce and great service!!!  They also make abelskivers for a special which is a nice treat!  Love this place - we are patrons a few times a week."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their food is amazing and the people are really nice! You have to try their homemade jelly, it is to die for! The prices are reasonable and they have a huge selection  for breakfast. I highly recommend the banana pecan French toast."}
{"text":"It was just ok. 

Gluten free pancakes were good but a little sweet. The Popeye omelette was just ok also. 

Cute inside and the service was good."}
{"text":"Breakfast House is one of my favorite breakfast restaurants. The customer service is great always greeted with a smile and a warm welcome hello. There is plenty of room so it doesn't feel so crowded, but keep in mind this place is pretty popular so sometimes there is waiting lines. However I've never waited any longer than 30 minutes. To be honest it's so worth the wait. The food always comes out at the perfect temperature. There is just about a little bit of everything from your typical breakfast plates of eggs, sausage or ham with pancakes on the side to El Paso omelettes  with sour cream and guacamole. Also I'm so happy they finally added new coffee options for all the coffee addicts like myself. There is the cold brew and the frapp coffee. I have to admit I wasn't a fan of the cold brew it tasted a little water down. It was like making coffee and putting ice and then when I added cream and sugar wasn't as strong as I would like my coffee. Also I tried the frapp and I usually like the taste of this one more, but this time I didn't like that the mixed used wasn't blended well. I could feel the grittiness in my mouth. They do need to step it up in regards to there iced coffees, but I can see there heading towards the right direction. (-1 star) Overall I really recommend this place for breakfast or brunch. Also a heads up the restaurant will no longer take credit or debit cards ONLY cash starting September 1st. I know that might be an inconvenience, but the good thing is that there will be an ATM. Don't let that discourage you. Stop by and see what everyone is talking about!"}
{"text":"Fresh squeezed OJ? Water and coffee pitchers and carafes, instead of having to wait for the server? Rare to find a breakfast place like this today. The food is excellent and different enough from the norm to stand out but not be offensive. 

The coffee is brewed in Tempe and the OJ is made on site. I'll definitely be returning soon. 

Service was great too!"}
{"text":"Had brunch today at this place. Let me tell you, it was great! Not one single complain. The food came out fast and service was delightful. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This is a place not to be missed!   Excellent food at reasonable prices.   Everything appears to be homemade (restaurant made!) and quite good.  Servers are all pleasant,  but we really prefer Emily. 

Restrooms are spotless,  which is atypical of many places.

Downside?  Be prepared for a wait on the weekend.   It's really worth it! !!!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a bite to eat for breakfast.  Our server was knowledgeable and friendly.  The fresh squeezed OJ was great and even came with a free refill.  Food came out quickly and it was very good.  A Mom & Pop joint that sure beats Denny's or IHOP."}
{"text":"Super tasty, great selection, kid's meal is a bargain. And the staff are super cool. Not what I expected in middle-of-nowhere phoenix.

Egg dishes rocked, especially the huevos rancheros. Try the tortilla soup also. On the lighter side, the strawberry salad was a winner (the dressing, not so much). As good as I'd expect to find back in CA.

Great roadside joint in a rather odd little neighborhood."}
{"text":"Their breakfast was pretty good and their fresh squeezed orange juice is pretty refreshing :).."}
{"text":"Very good and worth the wait! Been wanting to try this place for quite some time. We went for Sunday brunch.  There was a 35 min wait but it seemed to go quicker than that.  I got the 5 egg white scramble and wasn't disappointed.  The biscuits are fresh, homemade and wonderful.  Looked like they make quite a few different pastries. 
The service was great! Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"I love this place, The food is amazing and the staff is fantastic."}
{"text":"Quite simply the best mom and pops breakfast spot my wife and I have had the pleasure of eating at. We're from Northern California and enjoyed our breakfast and fresh OJ here tremendously. Unfortunately they ran out of the Cinnamon rolls when we came here which was a bummer but speaks to their popularity. Will return when we come to the area. The wait was like 45 minutes when we came here on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Great place where you'll find locals. Worth a drive. Baked goods and pancakes to die for. Portions are huge. Service was fast and super friendly."}
{"text":"I have to say this is hands down one of the best breakfast places I have ever been too. We decided to try it because of the recommendation of one of my neighbors whom works there Seta. We were seated immediately, ordered coffee which again was great I must say and we went and ordered the chicken fried chicken and the pancake meal. both were amazing!! the French toast tastes like a funnel cake and the eggs cooked perfectly! we definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"This place is the greatest!! The French toast are just incredible and staff is always happy and friendly. Great family place on a Sunday morning. 

Beats IHOP or Denny's ANY DAY!"}
{"text":"Went here on Sunday. Kept checking the live google map updates showing there was a long line and finally showed up around 1pm. They said it'd be a 15-20m wait but actually we got in after about 7 minutes!  

We went because I was in the mood for a big ole cinnamon bun and I'd read good reviews about theirs so we ordered that, the breakfast tacos and the biscuits and gravy. 

The waitress was very attentive and efficient. Super friendly without being \"much\". The food was out pretty quickly. Our favorite was the biscuits and sausage gravy. Biscuits were moist and the gravy had a perfect flavor. The breakfast tacos were also pretty good. Super large and filling. Only thing I'd want is a better (thicker) flour tortilla. The most disappointing part of the meal was the cinnamon bun we came for. It was just average and the outer layers were dry. 

Overall a solid place that I'd go back to!"}
{"text":"This place is super affordable, spacious, and has a diner feel to it. It reminded me of the Cinderella movie that Hilary Duff acted in haha. 

I ordered...

GRANOLA W/ GREEK YOGURT & FRUITS: This was around $5 & for the portion size it will fill you up! They aren't skimpy with any of their portion sizes. I was feeling something light but filling & this made the cut! 

OATMEAL: My friend got this cos she was also craving something light & the portion size of the oatmeal was more than enough! It came with a side of almonds, brown sugar, and milk. 

CUSTOMER SERVICE: They were friendly, quick, & accommodating! Even though this wasn't a big deal, my friends were sharing a burger for breakfast and the workers were thoughtful enough to cut the burger in half, split the hash browns, and put their shared breakfast onto two separate plates. Not a huge gesture but really thoughtful, nonetheless. 

P.S: Their OJ comes in a little cup but there's one free refill."}
{"text":"My bf had a place in mind to go for breakfast for Mother's Day but I wanted to spend it w/ his sister and her twin boys so our plans changed. And I'm so happy it did! The place was very busy when we got there. We waited almost 20 minutes and was told that it was a 30 minute wait.  As we waited, we were informed by the other customers that they tend to be busy all the time but we won't be disappointed. And WOW! The wait was worth it. They were right! I love a good breakfast place. I love the customer service - they were fantastic. Very friendly and attentive.  The food was beyond what I expected! I ordered their \"fresh squeezed\" orange juice which was good. I love that you get 1 FREE refill for the Fresh OJ. And it was not to pulpy...just the right amount! My girls ordered chocolate and vanilla milkshake and both shakes were creamy & yummy. My girls definitely enjoyed it. Both of my girls ordered the kids pancake w/ bacon. It came w/ 4 dollar size pancakes and a bacon. My oldest ate 3 of the 4 of the pancakes. She loved that they were fluffy and delicious. My bf ordered their eggs and pancakes w/ home-style fried potatoes - he said it was delicious and ate every thing on the plate! I had a taste of the home-style fried potatoes, it was seasoned well and loved that it was cut smaller. The twins had cinnamon rolls with their large chocolate milk- the cinnamon roll looked gooey and yummy! I shared the famous chicken fried chicken w/ my bf's sister. She warned me that it was big so I prepared myself for it. It was delicious - the chicken was seasoned & cooked right and I love the French toast that came with it! We ordered cinnamon rolls to go because they looked so yummy and I was too stuffed to keep eating. I definitely over indulge myself! I love this place! Chandler/Tempe definitely needs a Breakfast house like this!"}
{"text":"I was super stoked to visit this place. Came in on a Saturday morning. There were people, but no line. We must've came in before the rush. I ordered the huevos rancheros and the SO had scrambledeggs+fruit+biscuit. The huevos were really, really delicious to begin with - the bean/egg combo were ace. The tortilla underneath was a bit too hard and crispy for my liking. As I was eating everything though...i started to feel a bit nauseous. I'm not sure if it was the green chile...my body, or what. I don't usually have a sensitive stomach but it did not sit too well at all. I was nauseous for awhile. 
The SO's plate was basic and ordinary. She said the biscuit was underwhelming for house made.

Not a whole lot of vegetarian options but I read that they're able to make a tofu scramble/veg subs. Very nice to feel accommodated. 

Our server was very friendly and accommodating. The setting was welcoming and homey. Maybe we'll give this place another shot, maybe not. Glad I did finally get to try it. Sad my stomach didn't enjoy what I put in it."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to try this place for awhile, but since there was always a line of people outside whenever we drove by, we kept passing it up. We finally dined there today (Tuesday late morning) and boy, are we glad we did! 

The place was busy, but there were two open tables so we were seated right away. Our server was genuine, friendly, and efficient. We had the fresh squeezed OJ (best I have ever had) and split the brioche cinnamon bun. It was warm, gooey, & sensational...no denying that they make these from scratch every day! We had the chicken fried chicken and WOW! Juicy, tender, flavorful...my husband was in love! Our over easy eggs were cooked perfectly and the crispy hash was awesome. AMAZING food and excellent service. 

The cash only policy didn't bother us. I rather a small business pay their staff well and provide a positive environment than ya guests having the \"convenience\" of paying with a credit card. Plus, there is an ATM inside the entrance. 

No doubt we will be back and next month will be bringing our family from out of town with us!"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place other than TOOOO close To my home on Saturday and Sunday mornings...Enjoy something new every time I go in and it's always hard to resist their house cinnamon rolls and bottomless freshly squeezed Orange juice...
Highly Recommend!!!"}
{"text":"2nd time we found ourselves in the area recently and when the topic of breakfast came up it was a pretty easy decision... Original Breakfast House. The 2 things that stick out for me... the French Toast and the Pancakes. The Pancakes have a lemon zest of some sort added and it's great. It's what separates these pancakes from others. It's not overwhelming, it's subtle so enjoy it. 

Expect a wait during peak morning hours but the complimentary water and outdoor waiting area helps. With the fall approaching, the sun won't be so bad like it is during the summer hours when waiting and if your going solo, head inside and look for an open spot at the bar tables to the right."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp as I arrived mon early morning but didn't make it here til fri.Couldn't go back home (Orange County in California) without trying it!Good decision!!!Raspberries & Chocolate chip pancakes caught my attention,they are very good but loved the 3 leches pancakes too!Great coffee,which is very important to me,but the fresh squeezed OJ is a plus.Love to see the owner involved,makes the difference.Will defenetly be our breakfast place whenever we're in AZ.No name tag but our server gave us great service.My Son loved his chorizo taco & nephew his ham breakfast sandwich

{"text":"We live close so we get to come here often. The food is delicious, the service is great and the music is the best! :)"}
{"text":"Amazingly different breakfast. Great place to pick up your calories or just have a healthy, wholesome breakfast."}
{"text":"Awful & expensive.  Coffee cold, eggs not cooked well. Sausages not cooked all the way.  Plus, they only take cash."}
{"text":"We tried to get in on Sunday morning @ 9am and the wait was too long, so we returned on Tuesday @ 9am and got right in.  Our waiter was awesome and very knowledgeable about the menu and made some great recommendations.  Everything is scratch made and fresh.  There is so much to choose from, it is hard to decide - but you can't go wrong.  They are very flexible with substitutions and add ons - so you can get exactly what you want.  My only complaint was with the biscuits in my biscuits and gravy.  They are dry and crumbly, the gravy was fantastic though, I would order it as a side next time.   All the egg dishes were delicious and the bacon is cooked perfectly and full of smoky flavor.  The hash browns are perfectly browned.  The pancakes have a hint of lemon flavor added to the batter, very light & fluffy.  The big winner was the French Toast !!!!!  BEST WE EVER HAD!!!! It is amazing.  They dip it in the pancake batter and deep fry it, paired with whipped creamy butter and incredible maple syrup- it was one of the best tasting things we had ever had."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened to this place but please go back to how it was. Did obh get new employees because I remember them being a lot nicer. Anyway the food is always good here and I'm always happy to get the fresh squeezed orange juice but the glass for the juice had a chip in it and the water glass on the table had stuff in it. I understand it was a busy day but when the hostess sat me she didn't bring me any water she just ordered the busser to do it. My server was nice but I hardly saw her someone else came to give me my food and then my server came back asked how it was and gave me my check and that was the last time I saw her. I'm just really disappointed about the service here, it's not hard to simply ask someone to do something instead of raising your voice or to be demanding. It's just really unprofessional. These stars are basically for the food definitely not the service"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast spots in phx! Great customer service and delicious food. They are always busy which says a lot. Highly recommend trying their omelettes and pancakes ."}
{"text":"We came on a Monday about 11am. The parking lot was full as was the restaurant. It was pretty noisy inside but we didnt mind.
We were immediately greeted and given a carafe of water. I had the China Mist tea. I ordered sausage and eggs for about $10. The eggs were great, sausage had a piece of fuzz or hair on it , home fries were very flavorful but could have been cooked a bit longer. I ordered sourdough toast and it was AMAZING. It comes with a butter pat, which they left out long enough to allow it to be spreadable. I dislike it when restaurants let their butter sit in the fridge so it chips and doesn't spread. My husband had biscuits and gravy. I always compare gravy to the gravy we make at the restaurant I work at. It was ok. It wasn't as good as Chef Michael's from AJ's Fine Foods in Glendale (best gravy ever!!!). All in all we will return and bring our kids because I think they will enjoy all the sweets they offer. Our serve Seta was an awesome server!!! Very friendly, she deserves five stars!"}
{"text":"This place only takes cash. This place is worth going to. Went with two of my friends for breakfast! You get a lot for your money. I will be coming back again."}
{"text":"You will not be disappointed with your breakfast here.  The Spam and eggs is no joke.  It is REALLY good.  They have jelly they make themselves that is phenomenal.  The gravy on the biscuits and gravy is one of the best I have ever had.  The ham is the most tender and delicious I have ever had.  Like every other good breakfast place in town you will need to wait to get in on the weekends.  But it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"This specific location has been several restaurants in the past few years yet this current  offering is the best!  

OBH is a fantastic breakfast/ lunch place in North Phoenix. They do offer lunch yet I've had their breakfasts only and never disappointed. 

They offer the usual fair such as eggs, oatmeal etc yet then things get nuts such as their Spam dish and the fried chicken dish that is best shared. 

The staff is very friendly and although this place can get crowded, the wait time has never been too long and they do a great job getting people served quickly.

Great place for small or large gatherings although the noise level can rise some.

We really enjoy coming here and hope OBH will be a mainstay for some time!"}
{"text":"We have found our new breakfast place! Love the Costa Rica coffee! Great pancakes and great service. Get the maple syrup. You can watch them squeeze your orange juice for you."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful time, great food, got to see friends there this morning and very decent prices :)"}
{"text":"Wow! Where to start? I have food allergies (legumes- soy, beans, peanuts, etc). This place had no problem at all with this! 

GREAT FOOD! Large servings. FRESH SQUEEZED ORANGE JUICE with a free refill! Large Cinnamon rolls to die for(made from scratch on site from Brioche dough using lots of real fresh butter). Excellent service that is friendly and quick. 

We liked the place so much that we went back 3 times in 4 days! Will got back EVERY TIME we're in Phoenix! My son lives there so we visit frequently."}
{"text":"Ah.Maze.Ing!  The menu is diverse and offers a lot and the portions are more than generous!  Food is local, organic, etc.  Staff is very friendly and accommodating. I ordered the B&G and like to think that I'm a pretty good judge (born/raised in the Midwest with lots of Mom n Pop diners/cafes who know how to prepare solid homecooked meals) and I think OBH hits is dead on with their recipe!  Loaded with sausage, biscuits are solid but not heavy and flavor is devine.  Hubby ordered the seafood omelett that Chef offers 1/month - he was in heaven to say the least and the serving was plentiful to fill him up (he's a big guy!). We had the opportunity to talk with our server as well as the owner, great business.  We will return soon, and often!"}
{"text":"Great service,food and smiling faces.  You won't be disapointed. There are squeezing fresh oranges as I write this."}
{"text":"Great food and very quick service. This was during a packed house on Veterans Day. Will come back."}
{"text":"My husband and I had breakfast here on a Saturday morning. It was predictably busy, but since we were ok with sitting at the counter, we didn't have to wait long at all. A few highlights: 
- the cinnamon roll. warm, gooey, and crazy delicious. helps that I was hungry
- a free refill on the fresh squeezed oj?! yes, please!! I got the refill to go (and pro tip - she gave me a little more to fill the cup all the way)

So the neighborhood perhaps isn't the greatest and the views aren't anything special, but there's plenty of convenient parking and I appreciate being able to get an awesome breakfast without having to drive all the way to Scottsdale. So why only 4 stars? Hubby wasn't wowed. Maybe he didn't love the banana pancakes as much as he should have. I thought my popeye omlet was very tasty! Fast, friendly service and a decent sized menu that has all the things you'd want and more."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE breakfast/brunch spot. The chicken fried chicken is so crisp and delicious. The french toast is the best I've ever had. Service is great too! The wait times can get long (to be expected) so plan on arriving early."}
{"text":"I don't see what the hype is about this place. This is an average breakfast spot with average food. But where is the eggs bene? How can a breakfast place not have it?"}
{"text":"My boyfriend are in town visiting family and we found this place using Yelp. And I'm so glad we did, it was delicious!! I had chicken fried chicken with deep fried French toast and over easy eggs. It was my first time having chicken fried chicken and I was super impressed. The restaurant seemed to move people in and out very quickly which was great because the line looked pretty long at 9am. Wish I could have tried a few more things on the menu."}
{"text":"We discovered this place by accident. The wait was not bad. 15 minutes on a Sunday morning. The waitress was super friendly and the owner checked on everyone on a regular basis which is quite rare in a restaurant. We shared the farmers omelette and the raspberry, chocolate chip pancakes. They were both amazing. The orange juice is freshly squeezed, and you get a free refill. The only reason I am not giving it a 5 stars is because the bus boy station was close by and they were quite noisy slamming plates and silver ware."}
{"text":"Very friendly and clean.  The OJ was really good, fresh.  A little pricey, but food was good."}
{"text":"I was in expectation of good eats. We went here yesterday, had to wait 20 minutes.. Not bad. Our mouths were drooling, the menu sounds yummy. But when we got our food (pancakes with bananas & pecans, pancakes with raspberries & chocolate, French toast, ooey gooey mess, breakfast potatoes, scrambled eggs, sausage, & OJ) it wasn't worth the drool! If you took away the extras that they put in their pancakes, the pancakes are terrible tasting. There was no, or not much flavor to the food. To be completely honest: when you deep fry French toast, you loose the flavor of the French toast. I did like their breakfast potatoes & OJ....that's it! The service was friendly."}
{"text":"Nothing really to write home about (3.5 stars). Service was good (the menu note is true, everyone does smile). The food was just ok. We had coffee, cinnamon roll, biscuits and gravy and the egg/bacon/pancake combo. Cinnamon roll could've used more flavor, I did like that the frosting wasn't overly sweet. The biscuits and gravy no complaints. I ordered the gluten free granola and banana pancakes. I was disappointed when they came out because I thought the granola and banana would be in the batter, instead it was sprinkled on top. 

Also slightly inconvenient that they only accept cash. There are TONS of signs to let you know. They have a sign saying free ATM but that doesn't mean your bank won't charge you for using it. They have a long explanation on their menu saying that they pay over $50k in merchant fees and they would rather pay their employees more (which is thoughtful). However don't most businesses get to write off merchant fees? Or they could just charge customers a fee for using their card or even work it into their food prices. Anyways. If you try out this place, bring cash."}
{"text":"It's Christmas Eve morning and I'm here at my favorite local restaurant treating myself to another great breakfast.  I'm generally an eggs gal but my server, Divina (who is by the way one of the very best at her job) recommended the corn beef hash describing it as the \"best\". Having taken such recomendations in the past with many home runs and a few strikes and knowing that each persons 'best' can vary I decided to go ahead with Divina's suggestion and I'm glad that I did. 
And the best it was... out came a plate piled with potatos, green peppers and of course, the star....Real Corned Beef .. lots. ..sliced into chunks.. and yes.. the best.... yummy!!
Now I'm hooked... but folks be patient and diligent as this is not on there regular menu.. only served as a special because it takes so much time to prepare the best from scratch!!"}
{"text":"Found these guys on Yelp.  Came here for the first time during Spring training 2017.  Now I can't help but visit at least once a month.  I recommend trying the chicken fried chicken and French toast and/or the Chilaquiles.  Get there early as waits can be around 30 minutes (totally worth it) and it is cash only.  

They do have a zero fee ATM  within the restaurant."}
{"text":"ya  this is as good as it gets....... service is unbeatable!!
went this last sunday for the first time,  ok I picked a omelet that I was not very fond of....with out batting a eye lid the whipped me up the John Wayne (denver omelet) and it was as good as denver omelets get...fantastic  hash browns were fantastic  my wife had the french toast  very unique  everything we had was great  but the thing that stood out the most was the service,  we will return again and again  its very difficult to find places these days with service like this,  the way it should be.....  sorry no pics  I was to busy eating!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, great service.   The cinnamon rolls and French toast are a must!"}
{"text":"Im a big breakfast person and this place was ok. But ive definitely had better. Everything is really really greasy. The french toast is good however way to much and they deep fry it. First piece was perfect but second piece had way way to much batter on it. The veggie omlette had hard asparagus in it and the pieces were to big. And the prices are way to much for drinks. 3.75 for a small glass of orange juice. Yes its fresh squeezed but that is way way to much for a small glass.The only reason i gave them 3 stars is because the service was good."}
{"text":"great food and a very welcoming staff. They also had freshly squeezed Orange juice..which was an amazing change. The portions are huge and I absolutely loved the sides."}

Making way to Phoenix for a second consecutive Buckeyes' Fiesta Bowl, this time with two others to share in the fun, Breakfast on Friday was finally enjoyed at Original Breakfast House, the North-Central eatery somehow missed during nearly 18 months of living in the Valley of the Sun.

No doubt growing up a lot in intervening three years, a handful of Artisan Bakeries and Hip Brunch joints cropping up throughout the Metropolitan area, Original Breakfast House is located on N. 32nd Street and, although only born in 2011, the feel is much older - a Californian transplant achieving his goals in ownership by drawing a diverse crowd interested in the restaurant's comfort food classics.

Built on the ideals of good ingredients, smiling service and a 70's roadside décor, it was just past eight in the morning that a party of three was seated at a comfy booth near the entry point, more than half the tables already full with everything from elderly men to school-age children, the Bakery case and a Specials board each within eyeshot and offering no shortage of temptation.

Opting to dine in two-rounds, a total of four baked goods and two plates from the kitchen decided to be more desirable than the rest, items from the counter were presented re-warmed and partially melting, the Brioche Cinnamon Roll not as springy as some and more like Cinnabon while the Morning Glory Muffin was moist, dense and pleasant with a whole lot of Carrots and natural sweetness in the base.

Pleased by the creamy Lemon Scone, though less-so by a Poptart whose shell was unfortunately thicker and even more mealy than the Kellogg original, a stack of Triple Berry Pancakes with $1-supplement Pure Maple Syrup was par for the course with bursting berries both inside and on top of them while the Chicken-fried Chicken with Country Gravy and a slice of fried French Toast was worthy of highlighted-status as the Bird was crisp and juicy while the Bread was golden on the outside with its center Custard-soft."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for bringing family members when they come from out of town. Everyone can get what they love and the prices are unbeatable. Also... The orange juice is to die for!!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while. A friend and I went before 8am on a Saturday so didn't have to wait but we went once before a bit later in the morning and the wait was like an hour long. Go early! Our server was great, wish I could remember her name. They have Gluten Free granola banana pancakes that were fabulous. Their bacon is quite tasty too. The coffee was exceptional. Will def go back."}
{"text":"So good! Friendly staff. Tasty food. Cute diner vibe. Clean. Open and airy. Cinnamon roll is to die for."}
{"text":"Very good food and service. Orange juice fresh squeezed and omelette was unbelievable"}
{"text":"This place is top notch. their specials are always delicious. I usually have the Linguica scramble(spicy Portuguese sausage) with the banana pancake and breakfast potatoes and it's always delicious.  their fresh squeezed OJ is to die for. 
it's always reeeeeeeeally busy on the weekends so be prepared to wait a bit. It's 100% worth it though. They have fresh baked breakfast pastries (scones, muffins, cinnamon rolls, homemade pop tarts ) which i always want to try but am too full!!! they looks scrumptious though! 
this is a place i always take people who visit me from out of town. Great spot!!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal breakfast and awesome customer service ! Server was extremely friendly and even told us a little history about the place ! Will be coming back again"}
{"text":"Just ok. Staff was nice, but food was lackluster. I got the green chile omelette which could have used a little more seasoning. It did have plenty of green chiles though. Also got the French toast which was a little better."}
{"text":"Today was the first time going to OBH, and it definitely won't be my last! The carnitas omelette with the home-fries was amazing, and the fresh fruit bowl actually had good fruit in it(strawberries, blueberries, and bananas). The staff was super friendly and the food came out fast! Such a great place!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I go here almost every weekend and have tried multiple dishes. The omelets are fantastic, the burrito was huge and delicious, French toast was awesome!  Large portions and decently priced! The staff is always friendly and my food is always quick! I will definitely keep coming here! My only small complaint is sometimes when I get my food to go, by the time I get home the to go box is almost breaking because it absorbs the food. There are times it is lined with foil and that seems to really help, but when it's not it seeps through. I don't live to far but I imagine if I did it may possibly break through. Again this is a minimal complaint, the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"This is a 5-star place for my family! We have been here several times and the food and coffee are great. For mother's day we were able to get in within 15 minutes and my mother-in-law and I got the special which was a caprese omelet with fresh heirloom tomatoes and fresh basil. Amazing! We even felt comfortable bringing a toddler and a 1 year old and they blended right on in. So, in all, great food, great ambiance for a young family and great coffee (which is super important to me) and the price is right, about what you expect for breakfast these days."}
{"text":"They say breakfast is the most important meal of the day. What better place to have that meal! I came here in May 2015 for the first time and I really enjoyed it. I read the reviews here on Yelp and I was pleased to see that this place is highly regarded. Great food, service and atmosphere! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I have absolutely no idea why I waited an hour to get a seat. It's nothing crazy. 

I thought because there was a huge line and hundreds of positive reviews that this place is going to be AMAZING, but it was whatever. 

I wouldn't go back tbh, they said the wait is 20-25 mins but it took little over an hour to get seated. 

It's a small place and it's definitely not a place to go if you're in a rush. 
Make sure you have a lot of time and are very patient. 
The breakfast was good, again nothing crazy. 
Definitely get their orange juice! That was very good freshly squeezed orange juice!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! The food is so good it's almost unbelievable! I had the French toast special and I been wanting it everyday since!! Will recommend to everyone and be a regular possibly frequent guest!!"}
{"text":"My bro-in-law took me to this place last weekend for breakfast. Saturday morning around 10ish and it was packed out the door. I think we waited about 30 minutes for our table which wasn't too bad all things considered. Our server was extremely friendly and fast on getting us refills and explaining the menu, specials and answering any questions we had. 

I ordered the chicken fried chicken with eggs and french toast along with a cinnamon roll. The cinnamon roll was outstanding. It's a good size too, not small and not \"Oh shit, I guess I'm passing pieces out to the other tables\" big. The french toast was very dense and tasty. One piece is plenty and stupid me ordered 2, which I couldn't finish. The eggs were also very good (some places DO have bad eggs) as was the chicken and sausage gravy. Everything seemed homemade and I would be very interested in going back to try their lunch items, but they're spot on for breakfast, so go just for that."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times & like the food very much. The staff are very friendly & the management (I think they're the owners) are very attentive to the restaurant.

The only thing missing is a decent place to wait for a table. The waiting area inside seats about 6 people, otherwise you have to wait outside. This is a popular place on the weekends & the wait times can be very long (an hour+) & waiting outside during the summer can be extremely uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I love their french toast!  I wish this place wasnt so far away from me.  They are almost always busy when I go, so be prepared to wait a little. 

Cash Only - ATM inside."}
{"text":"Went to visit some friends in phoenix and found this gem! This place is family owned and serves all organic and cage free eggs as well. I ordered the breakfast sandwich and it did not disappoint! Service was quick and attentive and when we got our food it was heavenly. My friends all said the food they ordered was amazing as well. Great place for a high quality fresh breakfast."}
{"text":"The only thing better than the food was the service. I have been to a lot of breakfast place around the country and I can easily say that this was by far the best experience I have ever had. Orange juice was fresh squeezed and came with one free refill. The coffee was delightful fragrant with just the right amount of kick. The food was what really knocked my socks off, I didn't really know what to expect but the overall quality was amazing. The majority of their ingredient are purchased locally and farm fresh. If you are ever in the phoenix area do yourself a favor and come have the best breakfast around."}
{"text":"Where to start, as a first time customer I went in bright eyes and ready to eat. The place did not disappoint. The food was amazing!!!! We started with freshly squeezed orange juice, they literally were squeezing the juice in front of us. Moving on to the actual meal, well the picture speaks for itself...HUGE portion size and delicious. To top it off they had crazy customer service. The place was packed but you can tell they were well prepared for the crowd. Need to go back and try their cinnamon rolls. 

My tip if you're with a small group keep an eye out for the bar seats. On the weekends the wait may be about 30min."}
{"text":"Landed in Phoenix and yelped best place to eat breakfast and this place pops up. We decided to check it out and it did not disappoint!! Their famous chicken fried chicken was amazing! So was the chiquul... chilequil...um. breakfast nachos! Dont leave without getting the raspberry creme pancakes!!! They've perfected the blend of creamy and tart, not too sweet, 5 star pancakes!! Super friendly folks, a great way to start your morning in Phoenix. Would eat here again!"}
{"text":"Went in for the first time last weekend,and frankly I don't know why we took so long to come here! The service was excellent, the food was delicious and fresh, and on a busy Saturday morning we were seated in less than 15 minutes. Yes, they are cash only, but there is a free atm in the restaurant,so no reason to complain about that! We will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This is our family go to place for awesome food!  We are never disappointed!  7 of us met today and we are thrilled with the service, food and ambiance!  Celebrates the adult grandson's birthday. Enjoyed their anniversary party and brought home commemorative mugs!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"My husband ordered the shrimp and grits and he said it was better than anything Mama made back in the bayou. PS: My husband is from Salt Lake City. I ordered eggs and two kinds of potatoes. It was delicious. This is our new favorite breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Had researched many places to eat for our trip to the Phoenix area and this restaurant kept popping up as a place that was a MUST DO.  So, we headed that way, an hour out of our way and would absolutely do it again if I was in the area again.  The combination or the food and service, made the trip absolutely worth it.  The food is a plenty but it all looked so good, we did not hold back.  We ordered the garden hash which came with organize veggies, the potatoes were fantastic and the other veggies were not overcooked, with this for a $2.00 up charge, I ordered the cinnamon bun, which they put in a to-go box, as I knew I would not have room and they were happy to do that.  We also had the Popeye Omelet that had spinach and cheese a plenty, doing an up charge for the French Toast, which they fry.  If you like funnel cake, which is somewhat how they described it, which was completely accurate, you will love it.  If you like more traditional french toast, this may not be how you like it but it was a neat take on french toast.  I also cannot say enough about the service, it was laid back, friendly but still totally efficient and attentive.  It was great.  Go here, you will not be disappointed.  As others have stated it is CASH ONLY, so go prepared but they do have an ATM to access should you forget."}
{"text":"This is a great local Breakfast place but sat mornings are a wait. Go during the week! Fresh local food - sausages from Schreiners! yum"}
{"text":"I love breakfast, my bf doesn't but we both agree... This is our new breakfast place. Worth the wait! Amazing Popeye omelet....yum!"}
{"text":"My wife and I get breakfast up here on the weekends. Sometimes we have to wait for a table. But if you get there early enough that's  never a problem. The food is great. She normally gets the ham scramble and I love the pancakes."}
{"text":"Everything about this place seemed great. Staff was amazingly friendly and attentive. The meal recommendation was on point. Then the food came and half of it was undercooked. Had I not gotten the GRAVY on the side I would have just dug right in and gotten sick for sure. I'd definitely give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Visiting from LA and came here for breakfast there was a wait, but the line moved quick. The service is great and super friendly and the food is super yummy."}
{"text":"We had the hog heaven omelette, chocolate chip pancakes and biscuits and gravy. We were excited to try everything after reading the reviews on Yelp, but ended up leaving disappointed. Our food arrived cold and burnt. If u like lemon juice in your pancakes :0 this is the place for u! The service was the only bright spot of an otherwise unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"My family absolutely loves this place!!  We are hear a few times a months for breakfast. Their pancakes and french toast are great. They have wonderful daily specials at a great price. Service is fast and friendly. I love the fresh squeezed OJ and you get a free refill!"}
{"text":"Very casual, home feel (as another stated).  The difference between breakfast restaurant's is most evident with the french toast/pancakes/crepes.  OBH has pretty good French toast - and they are big!  Downside is if you want the banana pecan or blackberry versions its a $2 upcharge for very small portion of either item added to the top (its not cooked into or thru) - I'd skip that because the toast is the same otherwise.  I'm a chicken friend chicken and eggs guy so with that menu item titled \"FAMOUS\" I had fair expectations and asked for extra gravy.  Gravy makes or breaks it.  The chicken was cooked perfectly and good portion (2) - they Gravy broke it though - very flavorless and kinda pasty (my opinion).  They charge $1.50 for extra gravy (they forgot it in my case and I caught it on the bill and it was corrected).  Portions are large.  Service was ok.  The owner has a great video on the site.  The French toast was good enough I'll be back for that and to give this place another shot.  The orange juice is talked about a lot (and that you get 1 refill).  I really wish the Gravy was better as I stated the Chicken was cooked perfectly...  I might give it another shot (maybe the gravy was missing something that day - however the front desk guy said its their special version)."}
{"text":"Delicious pancakes and size portions. Cash only though! They have a fee-free ATM in the restaurant though which is super convenient!"}
{"text":"Holy cow this place has turned me into a breakfast/brunch lover! I've never been huge on breakfast/brunch type offerings but there is legitimate magic in their food. 

The menu is huge and it would probably have been taken me a little while to decide on an item if it wasn't for a big white box on the menu with Chicken Fried Chicken in large font; that made my decision easy. The order also comes with a side of french toast. I couldn't resist substituting the regular french toast for their mouthwatering banana pecan french toast. 

Everything was amazing! Service was friendly, chicken had a nice coating, eggs cooked well and an out-of-this-world french toast. This will be my go-to breakfast/brunch spot from now on."}
{"text":"We have driven by this place several times and the line is always out the door. We finally went last weekend and the food was amazing. I can see why the line is always out the door. The wait is worth it. The seating area outside was comfortable, cute and in the shade. The serving team were busy but were on top of checking on tables and keeping us happy. I even noticed the entire team working together to squeeze fresh orange juice. It was refreshing to see such team work. We will for sure be back."}
{"text":"We were told about this place by the bartender at our favorite watering hole and we are happy he shared it with us. Everything we have had is home made and awesome, even the coffee! We go for breakfast every time we have a chance. Great food, chill atmosphere, friendly staff. Gotta try this place."}
{"text":"Best. Breakfast. Ever. Not kidding, and we don't even eat breakfast very often. Lately we've been trying out breakfast restaurants and have not found a winner until now. I ordered the country fried steak, (came with hash browns, eggs, AND pancakes which I subbed.) My over hard eggs were not runny at all, cooked to perfection, and the country fried steak breading wasn't falling off like it always does other places. Tender, delicious, and juicy! The gravy, oh my GOD the gravy. Made from scratch, they mean business. And, dont let me forget the FRESHLY squeezed orange juice, that was literally squeezed right before our eyes behind the counter, freshest orange juice I've ever had. It was amazing. My fiancé ordered the biscuits n gravy, with fried potatos, and a ham steak. The potatos were perfect and not overly seasoned, just how she likes em. The ham steak we shared was bursting with flavor, I can't pin it, but it was mouthwatering... my pancakes were fluffy and light, not heavy at all..and had a delightful little hint of lemon. I've never heard of that in a pancake, but it was the best pancakes I've ever had. Everything was top notch. The only thing was that the sugar container had accidentally been filled with salt, so when we drank our coffee which we had salted up generously, we quickly had bitter, tart faces of disgust and surprise. Ugh. But.. the owner or manager (Not sure who he was) came over immediately and fixed the problem, replaced our coffee, creamer, and sugar, and took our coffee off the bill. Everyone was very friendly and cheery, the place was busy but spacious, and bright, and we absolutely loved our visit this morning."}
{"text":"El paso omelette is the shit. Triple berry french toast,  also amazing. The coffee is great too!"}
{"text":"Ok in all honesty other people's food looked good and so did mine BUT the taste is a whole different story. I left my food there I couldn't even eat it. I don't know what all the fuss is over this place maybe I got the wrong thing. I will say they get 2 stars for their OJ which is fresh and you only get one refill for about $4."}
{"text":"Had a late breakfast there today. Tried the Green Pork Chili Benedict. Flavorful with a hint of heat and a hint of sweet. Great service and a happy attitude by all the staff."}
{"text":"Had the chilaquiles which were phenomenal. Our server was sweet & made a lot of recommendations, everything is purchased from local farmers markets & organic which I love! It's no wonder this place has such great reviews!"}
{"text":"The orange juice was good, the service was friendly.  My husband got the chocolate chip raspberry pancakes, and I got the banana pecan French toast.  They were both ok."}
{"text":"I'll admit to some healthy skepticism whenever I see a restaurant touting cage free eggs and organic milk and local produce and the like.  Not that I don't love all those things. I do. But I fear it might be like the restaurant with horrible food that people keep going to because the great view. Often we are so focused on doing the right thing with our choices that we might accept a little less in the way of flavor to be socially responsible. Fortunately, my skepticism was totally unwarranted in the case of the Original Breakfast House. It's a gem.

Do try the pancakes. The lemon they add to the batter can be sensed immediately at the table. The taste, the odd mix of buttermilk and lemon, is unique and wonderful.  OBH uses Mrs. Butterworth's syrup, a plus, and offers Vermont maple syrup for just a buck more, a nice option.

The French toast is a treat as well. They use thick cut sourdough bread deep fried in a batter containing hints of orange, cinnamon and vanilla. Fresh raspberries were offered as a special on one of our recent visits.

Two dollar and fifty cent kids meals make OBH a very kid friendly destination. Options include French toast, mini pancakes with bacon and a two egg cheese omelet.  The two youngsters that accompanied us on one of our recent visits loved the choices.

One small disappointment. Sometimes the simplest things present the greatest challenges, in this case serving hot and fresh toast. The sourdough toast served to one in our party was cold and dry. Even homemade strawberry preserves were not enough to make it edible. I guess they should have used the bread to make more delicious French toast. Everything else was so wonderful (did I mention the green chili omelet?) that it did not really matter.

The staff is young, energetic and friendly. I'm not quite a true regular at OBH as of yet, but I'm planning on becoming one."}
{"text":"French toast was great as was the orange juice. Eggs and bacon were just okay. Nothing special.  I will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday breakfast and it was fantastic! Everything about this place is so fun! Can't wait to come again. Food was great, service was great!"}
{"text":"Let me first talk about the building, from the street it doesn't look too appealing. After reading the reviews on yelp we still decided to give it a shot. When we pulled into the parking lot and saw the entrance it looked a whole lot better. Walked in and was greeted by a lady with a smile on her face who you could tell was glad to see you!

Ordered the asparagus, bacon and goat cheese scramble. That alone was one of the best things I've ever had in my life! My girlfriend got the French toast (see attached picture), both were appealing on the eyes and even better appealing on our tastebuds! 

I forgot the host name but she was such a sweetheart! Possibly the owner? Got to meet John and you could tell he took extreme pride in his establishment and the food he served! 

Recently moving from California it was so nice to see the surfboards and beach decor! I LOVE the fact that starting September 1st they won't accept credit cards and offer a FREE ATM! As someone who has been around small businesses his whole life I know how much those fees can be. Instead of passing it on to the customer John decided to eat the cost of the ATM fee! 

Cannot wait to come back here! Thank you OBH for an amazing breakfast"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Love the food and service was great. I'm from the south so it felt like I was back home for an hr."}
{"text":"We came here a day early for Mother's Day. It was busy but not overly (was told 25 min wait, ended up being a 15 min wait). The Banana Pecan French toast is THE best I have ever had, hands down. My husband had the Big Gooey Mess. He raved about it."}
{"text":"Chili omelet with hash browns and pancakes! Good flavor, just the right amount and good service. I'll be back, next time lunch!!!"}
{"text":"I was hoping this place would be 5 stars, but I can only give 3. The service was good, although I felt the waitress spoke too quietly and too fast when describing the specials. She also had way too much cleavage showing for a family restaurant. I opted to just get short-stack pancakes and hashbrowns since I wasn't super hungry. I judge pancakes on one simple thing... are they delicious when eaten with just butter? Yes, the certainly are! There is a hint of lemon in these and it's wonderfully unique. I asked for them to be a little overcooked (which they did, yay!) and they were still nice and fluffy. I also like that they use Mrs. Butterworth's syrup. It's my favorite! The hashbrowns on the other hand... unique, but not in a good way. It almost seemed like mashed potatoes were flattened in a pan and fried until brown on top and bottom. They were $3 for a small serving. I hardly ever send food back, but after two bites, I really did not want to pay for them! Cold, odd texture... just not good. My boyfriend ordered the french toast combo plate with scrambled eggs and bacon. The french toast looked amazing, but honestly, kind of reminded me of funnel cake (which I don't care for) because it's deep fried. Prices were reasonable for the most part, but I have a feeling they've gone up since some of the pics were posted on yelp. My pancakes were over $6 for just two (nothing else included). All in all, I will definitely give this place another try, but I'm still searching for breakfast perfection."}
{"text":"Always looking for a great breakfast place and I think we found ours.

The food and service are second to none. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"If you are visiting from out of town...you HAVE to go here! When we pulled up the outside is a bit deceiving...because the food is out of this WORLD. The deep fried French toast has the best crunch with a little bit of a vanilla and cinnamon flavor! You have to get it with the Fried Chicken. We. Are. Dead. The chicken is crispy and moist with the best gravy on top that is for sure made from scratch. Make the drive, try the good things. OH and the orange juice comes with a free re-fill. The end."}
{"text":"Breakfast was really good, ordered the omelet with egg whites, pancakes were delicious and the coffee was on point. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Great breakfast stop!  Portions are huge and everything tastes homemade. The only reason for a 4 star is coffee was bad."}
{"text":"Wow the food was amazing! And the service was kind and swift. Next time I'm trying the pancakes!

Parking: a lot so it's pretty easy. Lot right out front. 

Service: we had a party of 5 and they were swift and attentive. They came by with the waters and coffee. We told them we had some place to be after and they listened and helped us out. The venue is clean and cute. I loved watching the home made orange juice being made. 

Food: I got the eggs bacon hash browns and pancakes. I loved the crispy hash browns and cool that they give you three slices of thick bacon! What I really liked was the pancakes. They were so yummy and sweet. That home made jam was the best. I would ask for it if I went again and put that on the pancakes and toast! My sister got the gooey eggs with potatoes sausage mush egg and it was huge and super yummy. 

Fresh and delish and yummy! I would come back. And I will try some other pancake variety."}
{"text":"My mom and I came here for breakfast on Veterans Day. We had about a 30 minute wait which was to be expected. They have a lot of seating for people who are waiting for a table. 

When we did get our table it was probably one of the worst ones in the restaurant right in the flow of traffic. I asked the waitress if we could please have a booth which they did find us one. That was nice. It was very busy and quite loud in there. I'm not complaining about it I would just be warned if you're someone who prefers a more quiet restaurant. Also it was Veterans Day so it was like I said, really busy.

My mom and I both ordered a cup of coffee. It was pretty good I still prefer Crepe Bar's coffee. My mom also ordered the fresh orange juice. That was excellent!  They even give you a free refill. It is a bit pricey however. 

My mom ordered the French toast with scrambled egg and sausage. She like the French toast, but I didn't care for it.  it was deep-fried I found it to be way too heavy and very greasy just wasn't my style. My mom said the sausage was good I didn't try it.  We both agreed that the scrambled egg was delicious!  I really like how they prepared the egg. I could've gotten some more eggs but I was already getting full. 

I ordered the blueberry pancakes. They were very good.  I do like the little hint of lemon in them. I thought they could've had a little bit more blueberries though. We both payed the extra dollar to have the real maple syrup. 

Overall this is a good breakfast place. It's hard to come here and not over order. I left feeling way too full. I think I am just not a fan of big heavy breakfasts, but I do appreciate this place and their quality. I would go back for the scrambled eggs, and those cinnamon rolls looked really good!"}
{"text":"Oh Heavens! Please skip IHOP & head directly here. The people are charming and friendly, and, even though we had a short wait, the service was fast and the food incredible! Ordered the Blackberry French toast and was pretty sure I was delivered dessert for breakfast. Delicious with either the regular or special syrup, this is a must if you haven't had deep fried french toast in the past - tasted like something out of a State Fair from long ago. Portion was huge and I didn't finish it, nor did I need the side of eggs and bacon I ordered with it. Hot chocolate was a fun, whip creamed treat and the biscuits & gravy earned raved reviews from a very particular eater. Come and support this lovely gem!"}
{"text":"Had the chance to try this place last Saturday and it was a treat.  From the moment you walk in to put your name on the list you are treated to a delicious smell of food. We got to try the El Paso omelette and the triple berry French toast which are delicious. Orange juice is freshly squeezed and their coffee is outstanding.  Customer service was great and even though they are a cash only there is an atm machine at the entrance of the restaurant"}
{"text":"Growing up in the valley i feel like I've been to every popular breakfast joint in town. Somehow i had never even heard of OBH until i saw the amazing reviews on Yelp a couple years ago. I didn't make it until today, but Yelp has done it again. Great menu with several delicious options including fresh squeezed orange juice--everything you want in a breakfast spot. I ordered the chicken fried chicken (crispy and delicious) with their famous French toast. Wow, the French toast was sooo good--sweet, crunchy, and delicious. I like that they paired the French toast with the chicken meal because most restaurants make you order French toast separately. Similarly, my wife ordered a spinach omelette, hash browns, and a pancake. Pancake was an included \"bread\" option with no additional charge. 

Big attention:
READ THIS: bring cash, they are cash only. I was glad we happened to have some on hand because we didn't know this. 

Expect a wait during busy times--holidays and weekend mornings, but there's a comfortable shaded waiting area and it's definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"What a great find!!! Went there for the first time this morning. Great vibe, service and good food! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service!  Relaxed/comfortable atmosphere with very knowledgeable wait staff.  AMAZING chicken fried chicken and fried french toast.  My new go-to breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Seriously this place is as good as it gets. I live close by and stop in frequently. The food always, always, alwaysssss is great, fresh (freshly squeezed OJ) and perfectly made. The staff very nice and welcoming. I feel like family, truly feel that way here; so you will you.  I love the OBH it holds a special place in my heart and stomach! One more thing....in May 2015 I broke my jaw in 3 places, came here after 4 weeks of healing. I Craved it and decided I'll let the food melt in my mouth if I have to....my boyfriend told our waitress as we were trying to order that I had to have their food, but have been on a puree diet for 4 weeks... they blended my food!!!! Who does that, you'd think any place would to accommodate their customers, but again the CS here is hands down and hands up in praise. 

Forever a loyal customer here."}
{"text":"Love everything about this place! Service was fantastic...quality and quantity of food was fantastic...overall great first time experience, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and huge portions!  I had the goey mess (think that is what it was called).  So good and flavorful!  My husband tried the chicken fried steak and loved it!  The person next to me at the other table got the chiqachillies (sp) dish and that look so good also.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"There is only one word to describe the French toast: mutant! So thick & tasty, I may not eat another meal all year long."}
{"text":"I went today for my first time at OBH , Man what have I been missing all these years? selfishly didn't not even want to review this place because of fear it would be hard to get in next time but I can't do that to my fellow yelpers ;) let me start of with the quaint atmosphere here so cute and inviting. I had the big breakfast sandwich which was piled high with delicious ham , cheese, caramelized onion and a scrambled egg on a big tasty bun with a side of fresh fruit .My daughter ordered a lemon scone which was hot and fresh straight from the oven I have never had such a tasty scone in my life. The food was out of this world good I had a taste of my friends pancakes which had a powerful lemon taste to them I'm a big lemon lover so if you aren't the biggest Lemon fan not sure if you would be happy but I sure was. As far as the negatives on why I couldn't give this place a 5 star experience was because they were out of several options & staff was on the slower side and hard to get their attn when in need of things but you can't beat the price and quality of food so I would give it a solid 3.5 stars can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Used Yelp to find this place and it was excellent! Great traditional American breakfast fare, the El Paso omelette was great, my wife had the 5 egg white scramble and raved about it!  The kids menu rocks as well, Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast at this joint is wonderful. They offer a wide variety of delicious food at remarkably affordable price points. Specials abound and they even leave a coffee pot on your table!

Our server, Dezarae, made the experience memorable. When we asked what was delicious she was so cute. Her excitement bubbled over. I took the first suggestion offered and was very, very happy. The Juan Tacos are robust in flavor, needing little to perfect them. I did sprinkle in a bit of the guac and salsa to try. Excellent stuff.

I fork sampled the El Paso (an omelette with chorizo and green chilis) and one of the specials, Triple Berry French toast. I'm happy to report that the chorizo was spicy and not overcooked. The french toast was deep fried. Perhaps a heart attack in the making but I'd definitely try that solo.

Portions here are large. Definitely shareable. But why would you do that? Go family style and try different things!"}
{"text":"Super friendly and make you feel welcome and at home. Big portions, good food, simple"}
{"text":"Delicious place for breakfast. I had the French toast special with sausage and hash browns. The fresh squeezed orange juice is worth the price as well."}
{"text":"Divina is a wonderful waitress/server.  We love it when we get to sit in her section.  All of the staff is great, really - Divina is special."}
{"text":"Always a 5 out of 5. Amazing service, kid friendly, worth the 20-25 minute wait. California vibe- food is hot, Original and I've not once had a negative experience. We usually run into friends from the neighborhood. Great meet up for family easy, Sat./Sun. Breakfast. Have someone save a place in line for they get there before you and bump til they arrive."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday around 12:30 and the wait wasn't very long at all.  Unfortunately,  they were already sold out of the special. Our orders came out very quick which surprised me and the wife.  I ordered the chicken fried chicken which came with 2 eggs and french toast.  The chicken was moist and it tasted great.  The eggs were cooked perfect and the French Toast was the bomb. The place was very loud, but the food was excellent thus the 4 star rating. I would definitely recommend if you aren't trying to have a quiet meal."}
{"text":"Good breakfast - food, selection, quantity, coffee, prices.   Nice friendly staff/atmosphere, great service.   Read rave reviews about cinnamon roll but I liked the morning glory muffin best."}
{"text":"holy crap man, this place is awesome. wish we had more eateries like this in Los Angeles. had the best biscuits and gravy & French toast. Divina was great, the service was quick and food was solid. not very pricey either. four thumbs up."}
{"text":"Overall the food was pretty good. We went during the peak time so our wait was about 30 mins for 2 people. I got their pancake special with sausage and scramble eggs. Instead of the regular pancakes it comes with I added raspberry chocolate chip pancakes for 2$ more. The pancakes were really good! Sausage was delicious as well. They were nice and plump full of flavor. And let's not forget about their orange juice. It was so good. I even watched the lady freshly squeeze it. Service was great as well. Definitely a place I will go again!"}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place by far! If it's a Saturday, Sunday, or Holiday it's best to be there early... it gets packed FAST. Which, is always a good sign. 

Their two most important aspects are GREAT customer service and even better food. 

The manager/owner is always there asking customers how everything is. Employees are always happy. The colors are vibrant and the food is always superb. 

Tip: no cards accepted. BUT, free ATM in restaurant. It's not inconvenient.... it's smart. 

We bring all of our out of town guests here. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Overall this place is a fantastic place for breakfast. the food is delicious, there are lots of different options for those gluten-free, vegan and slim types, the staff is great and the atmosphere takes you out of the desert and throws you to the beach!
The only reason I would take out a star is mostly for the wait. I understand that places get busy no matter what but I'm really surprised that there isn't more space when they know how busy they get. Now they do an absolutely stunning job of utilizing the space and I know what kind of budgeting it takes to add on to a location (they really can't where they are at) so I'm not going to take away any stars. That and I am just a pro at making the wait time seem short (playing games like heads up or just having an actual deep conversation like a normal human being). 
For those of you that don't have a lot of time to sit and eat breakfast, I'd direct you to McDonalds where everybody else with no patience/planning or taste buds go.
***FYI*** THEY ONLY TAKE CASH, they do not accept credit cards because of the fees credit cards charge (don't blame them).
~THEY DO HAVE AN ATM THAT DOES NOT CHARGE FEES~ I have used this before and there truly are no fees. 
Remember kids always tip your waiters/waitresses"}
{"text":"we went their on friday morning around 9am and restaurant was fully packed. server was very nice and friendly. we ordered specials crab omlet and green hash with scrambled eggs. it came with hash browns and toast. for drinks we ordered coffee and organic apple juice. juice was so fresh and good. both omlets were really tasty. portions are huge so make sure u go hungry so u can finish. its a must try. i highly recommend. when we came out almost 20/30  people were waiting outside. it shows how popular these guys are."}
{"text":"If this brunch spot were a lady, She'd have my last name, half my net worth and be pregnant with my children by now. That's how life changing my entire experience here was...

I'd also like the record to reflect that this place is a solid 14 miles from where I live--perhaps the first time I have ever clicked on a yelp add AND had the audacity to actually drive out of my normal Arcadia breakfast comfort zone.  God bless America and I'm sure glad I did !

Like any good brunch spot worth it's weight in sodium, there was a wait but a very pleasant one at that.  They have lawn chairs out front where you can post up and soak up some rays before entering this breakfast wonderland.  

Entering this palace of culinary cunnilingus I immediately felt like royalty as a pleasant servant set a king size jug of coffee in front of me before delivering some fresh squeezed OJ to my lady friend and I.  Great start to an epic feast...

With our servers advice I settled on the French toast special--a regal orgy of flash fried bread, cinnamon, strawberries and fresh whipped cream fit fit for the gods themselves.  Add a couple strips of perfectly fried pig primed bacon and this meal will leave any mortal breathless, blurry of vision and ready for a cigarette.  

As Schwazzenager prophecized at the end of terminator 1, \"I'll be back. \""}
{"text":"I know I know. How could I rate this place 3 stars with all the amazing reviews. 

Service was just fine. Forgot her name but was taken care of just fine. 

I had the chocolate chip pancakes with 2 sides of sour dough toast. The Toast was not good (how can you mess up toast). 

The pancakes at first were dynamite but I realized they had a nasty after taste. Like a starch taste. I wouldn't re-order. 

The OJ was real good - gotta give credit to that. 

Overall, I'm the biggest Matt's big breakfast fan and thought this place could measure up with it. I'll stick to my fav spot"}
{"text":"There was a bit of a wait to get a seat here on a weekend morning.  Decent food though.  The cinnamon roll was soft and gooey and very tasty.  I also got an omelette that was very flavorful as well.  The building is older and won't blow you away but the lines out the door tell you this place knows how to cook good food.  Look for the giant blocks in the lawn to find it."}
{"text":"The husband and I went here last weekend with a couple of friends. There were some highs and lows to the visit. The other couple was there when we arrived and they had ordered a cinnamon bun. That was the high. This cinnamon bun was good... the frosting was a little tart, possibly cream cheese based... it was delicious. After that, things were just ok. Their coffee was fine ,but nothing special. The OJ, like others have said, is fresh squeezed and comes with a refill, which is generous of them. I had the egg sandwich for breakfast and, unfortunately, it just wasn't that great. It had a ton of bacon on it.... way too much, I had to take at least half off. The rest of the sandwich was lacking in flavor. It came with home fries, which were not very crunchy. The husband had blueberry pancakes, which were alright, but again, nothing special. I would come back here if invited, but I don't think I would drive out here again on my own."}
{"text":"I saw all the amazing reviews, and suggested this to my buddy for breakfast. The staff was terrific! Everyone had a smile on their face.

The food was just ok.It was 8AM on a Wednesday morning. I ordered 2 scrambled with crispy hash browns, sausage, and pancakes. The hash browns were square shaped and luke warm. The sausage was a thick link with not too much flavor. The Vermont \"real\" maple syrup was pretty tasty. Same for my buddy's hash browns. But we were in a little bit of a hurry, and only ate some of the hash browns and sausage.

I'll give this place another try. And I'm sure our waitress would have corrected our issue if we gave her the chance. Some people tip less if the food isn't right, but we didn't give her a chance to correct it. We tipped her nicely."}
{"text":"This place is amazing .  The food is wonderful and it comes out super fast even when every table is full.  I had the asparagus bacon goat cheese scramble today and I will definitely have it again soon ."}
{"text":"This is hands down my hubby's favorite spot for breakfast.  He loves their French Toast.  Breakfast is not my favorite meal but this joint takes the (pan)cake.  Lots of choices and a ton of food.  It truly is an indulgent trip as any food I ever order is not low in calories-but worth the splurge.  It gets jam packed."}
{"text":"This place has absolutely AMAZING food and great breakfast specials. My family and I came here on Sunday and they had a crab omelet special, it was so delicious, nice size, and came with (what I chose, fruit and pancakes). Their scones are amazing too! Their food is so great everyone loves coming here, which leads to a wait time, sometimes over 30mins....unless you're an early bird and get there first thing when they open. The food is a bit pricey for breakfast, but it's worth it. Service is great and it seems like no matter how busy they are the cooks are on point because you don't have to wait long for your food!!"}
{"text":"So the lover and I came here for brunch one day. We wanted to try something new. 

It was a Sunday, so it was about a 20 minute wait for a table for us two. There were so many good choices on the menu to choose from! I ordered the banana pecan French toast with a side of eggs. This thing was huge!! And so delicious! My fiancé got the country fried steak which he enjoyed.

The service was good even though they were busy. I would definitely come back to try some other items on their menu. I just wish they weren't so far. =("}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! Quick service, friendly, happy staff. They use all local organic produce and meats. And the food was just amazing!"}
{"text":"I came after reading the reviews and it was pretty good. I got the Chicken Fried Chicken w/ home fries and it came with the French Toast. The chicken could have used some salt in the breading or gravy but the potatoes were seasoned well so I just ate them together. The French toast was my fave! It was buttery and a bit crisp on the outside but soft on the inside. The coffee is also good!

It's super busy so it took a while for my server to come to my table (which is understandable) but she was a gem.

I would come back, maybe not during peak hours but I enjoyed it overall."}
{"text":"French toast - NO BRAINER! It's INSANE. Tip: get one slice for a $1 more when added to an omelette. That's plenty, it's like eating dessert for breakfast, it's so rich. And spend the extra $1 for real maple syrup. 

Five egg white omelette - pleasantly surprised that it was light and fluffy!

Oatmeal with bananas and pecans, with a nice selection of toppings. 

Fresh squeezed OJ - a rarity!

They have full range; a decadently delicious fried french toast, and perfectly made egg white omelette."}
{"text":"Hubs and I stopped in for breakfast after our Doctor's appointment and we weren't disappointed. Owner greeted us at the door, our server, Gina, was a delight, the owner's son checked to see if we were OK, as did the daughter-in-law. Such personal service is rare in this day and age. The food was top notch and the coffee was delicious. We both had a sense of deja vu, as the place takes you back to those good things you remember about home. Clean, bright and warm. Will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem! It's always busy on the weekends so we thought we'd try during the middle of the week, it's a great place they have organic foods and everyone's favorite foods.
I got the Egg scramble with spinach, mushrooms, and onions, avocado slices,picodigallo !! Delicious?"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I frequent this place weekly. Service is always great, food is always fresh, and the fresh baked cinnamon rolls are the absolute best!"}
{"text":"The portions are humongous, flavorful and well presented! The scrambled eggs were fluffy, the bacon was crisp and the French toast was made to perfection. I was a huge fan of the coffee as well."}
{"text":"Such a great spot to grab breakfast or brunch.  My husband can get his biscuits & gravy fix and I can get an awesome chicken salad sandwich with the best ever steak fries! it gets loud and busy, and there's usually a wait, but for good reason. We've tried almost all their omlettes and none of them disappoint. I just cannot find a bad thing to say about this place."}
{"text":"Best French toast I've ever had. It's a cash only business.. but there is an atm. So come prepared for that! Great quick service. And we went on Easter morning and still only had to wait less than 30 minutes!"}
{"text":"What a great, eclectic breakfast place. Friendly staff, unique menu, and fast service!"}
{"text":"This place all of a sudden does not accept cards. Drove a ways to come here.....OBH has lost a long time customer. Really poor business practice. This has nothing to do with not feeling like your food is worth paying cash for. Who doesn't accept cards in 2017? That's ridiculous."}
{"text":"OK, so we stumbled upon this place on a sleepy Sunday morning. I was so happy to see it, we were starving. Note: There are NO breakfast places along Shea Blvd....

I didn't even notice the \"all local organic\" thingy till we got inside. Nice I like that.

I did notice a disgusting sewer smell. No, it was not eggs. Just as I was thinking \"maybe its me\" a toddler voice shouted \"Mommy it stanks in here\" Toddlers don't lie. It did stink.

As I prayed whatever it was that stunk would go away, I pondered the menu. Not extensive but alright: eggs, omelets, french toast, pancakes.

The stink did come and go, thank gawd it wasn't constant, I wouldn't have been able to handle that.

I got the freshly squeezed OJ and it was great. I also ordered the French Toast. It sounded interesting as they use sourdough. Weird, right? It was weird. Not a fan of the sourness going through it. But it was nicely griddled and the syrup and delicious scoop of whipped butter helped. The eggs and bacon( a bit skimpy tho) on the side were very good, as were the hashbrowns I ordered on the side.

Hubs had the Popeye omelet, and my bite was very tasty.

All in all, a good place to go, but they really need to fix that sewer problemo."}
{"text":"This place is great! I ordered the 5 egg white scramble and it was right up my ally! A lot of places try to do a healthier option and the portion size is really small, but not this. My boyfriend ordered the El Paso omelet and didn't really like it, but mine was great! Elen was our waitress and she was wonderful :)"}
{"text":"Friendly service, tasty baked goods, real fresh-squeezed OJ. My go to spot for breakfast."}
{"text":"Very noisy in there.  On a Saturday morning there's a line out the door for at least a 20 minute wait.  The food was pretty good, but not amazing like some I've had (like Hash House in Vegas).  The servers and greeters are the sweetest people on earth!"}
{"text":"While staying at a local resort, we ventured out to find a place for breakfast.   We stumbled upon the Original Breakfast House.  It was bustling for a Thursday morning but we didn't have to wait long to be seated.  The place has hip, retro '70s California kind of vibe with classic breakfast fare. 
My son ordered the chorizo burrito.  It was huge! Stuffed with eggs, chorizo, green chiles and potatoes, then smothered in a green chile sauce and Jack cheese.  His words, \"awesome\"! 
My daughter ordered the Hog Heaven!  An omelet with, you guessed it, ham, bacon, sausage, and cheddar cheese.  Served with hash browns and pancakes.  No complaints on any part of it, the eggs were perfectly fluffy and filled with just enough of everything.  
My chicken fried steak and eggs was delicious!  Breaded and crispy without being tough.  A real stick to your ribs meal!  
Upon walking in we passed the case showing some baked goods so we had to end the meal with a brioche cinnamon roll.  Wow.  It was served warm with not too sweet icing cascading down the sides.  It is as epic as it sounds.  The owner came over and made sure everything was good as we devoured the sweet roll.  Well played. OBH, well played."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and I love the food, but tried to go today and discovered they are now cash only?!?! Who does that these days?!?! The fact that we only had a small amount of cash on us for 3 people required us to make the decision to leave and go somewhere else. Good way to lose business. Kinda bummed"}
{"text":"Let me say that the owners that had it for decades are gone.  The \"new\" owner has had the restaurant about 3 years.
The wait on a Saturday late morning was about 20 minutes for a table for two.  Not too bad.
The noise level in the restaurant itself was ABOMINABLE.  
The wait staff needed more help (as in bussers, drink order takers, etcetera) A LOT more help.  We needed a minute to look at the menu since it was our first visit, and we thought the server was never coming back.  This is not a slam to the server at all, it was just a busy mad house.  It got to the point that I told my companion that it was so loud I was getting a headache and that if she didn't come back in a little bit, I wanted to leave.
SO GLAD WE DIDN'T!
The food.  We both ordered the same thing.  The Farmers Market veggie omelet with the home fries.
Holy crap.
I hope the home fries didn't have MSG in them, but they were so good, it would be a sin that I forgive.
The omelet was probably made with butter-I wouldn't change a THING.

I told my companion that next time we come, we are bringing earplugs and a newspaper.  It's worth it.

On a side note, we ordered a cinnamon bun to split-not worth the calories.

The owner came around and was very pleasant.

All in all, I was super satisfied with the food and the service.

On a side note, they had a hostess that was wearing a very skimpy shirt, and for some reason, it made me very uncomfortable that I could see so much skin when she bent down to fix a table leg..."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Phoenix. Have tried any others but the OBH keeps us coming back. Terrific food and consistently friendly and efficient service. Bravo OBH. This fat man says yes."}
{"text":"We love this place. Today my wife ordered something she really didn't care for and our server, Theresa, insisted on replacing her meal with something else. The willingness to please a customer without being asked is a great example for other businesses. We always have great, friendly service when we come here.  Theresa was wonderful.  Never have a complaint about service at OBJ."}
{"text":"Great service, amazing food, good music! The deep fried French toast is literally to die for! More importantly a clean restaurant! -you can tell they take pride in their restaurant from the light fixtures to the shelves, windows, even a peak in the kitchen! Really clean! The service was amazing I can't say enough about Emily, she kept a smile, was very informative & totally on point with her recommendations! Every restaurant could use an Emily :)"}
{"text":"The El Paso omelette was fantastic. Fluffy eggs Perfect chorizo and veggies. Cinnamon rolls were perfect as were the sticky buns. My wife tried the strawberry cheesecake Pancakes a definite must try. Steer clear of the biscuits and gravy If you are expecting a true southern style sausage gravy. The gravy was almost sweet and had some onion notes. Everything else was spot on. Will definitely be back next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"No Eggs Benedict!? Super disappointing. How are you an original breakfast house and not have one of the best breakfast meals on earth? Don't get me wrong though, everything on the menu is delicious, just not what I want. Looks like they only hire ladies to do the serving, so there are always a bunch of dudes gawking around. This place is always busy to so have patience and don't come here in a hurry."}
{"text":"The breakfast here is delicious! The portions are huge, and I always leave stuffed every time I eat here. The pancakes with lemon and blueberries are my absolute favorite!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast! My husband are from California and always looking for good fresh food. We started off with the cinnamon roll, you must try it. Then he got fried French toast and I got the chorizo tacos! I would eat at this place everyday if I could. Best breakfast I think I have ever had. Don't miss this place! It is cash only, but they have an ATM you can use for free."}
{"text":"wish this place was closer to Anthem.  Always great service and excellent food.  My husband tried the French toast and chicken fried chicken and ate every bite.  I always enjoy the 5 egg white omelet.  Love the whole wheat toast and homemade jam."}
{"text":"I love this place Kelly is a great waitress the menu is full of great choices. I ordered the #1 which I recommend. The French toast was the best I've had here in Phoenix. The bacon was cooked perfectly and the prices are great."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here. The server was great, the food was awesome and the price was resonable."}
{"text":"Great food you will enjoy i did
Nice helpful staff
Clean atmosphere
Great food assortment
I left very satisfied."}
{"text":"Food is AMAZING!! Service was out standing. We came to the area on vacation and after the first meal we are already looking forward to going back!  We ordered a Cinnamon roll, biscuits and gravy, and the raspberry chocolate chip pancakes and everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! Came to visit Arizona for the weekend, and we were looking for a breakfast place on the way to Sedona. So happy we decided to pick obh!! I ordered the chicken sausage with scrambled eggs and side of home fries and toast. It's a little sweet too. My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken with gravy and French toast. Both were so delicious. My mouth is watering again even though I just left the restaurant :') his parents also ordered two delicious plates too! (Look at pictures) The service is amazing too. I don't know if it's just Arizona but everyone I've met so far is so friendly. The hostesses when I first walked in were so welcoming and our waitress was really attentive. We also ordered the fresh squeezed orange juice! One free refill! Must try if you're ever in Phoenix :')"}
{"text":"This place is everything a breakfast joint should be! The staff is very friendly, attentive, and all about customer service.The food is absolutely heavenly! I had the carnitas omelette with biscuits and gravy. I highly recommend this dish the cheese in the omelette contains maximum stretch. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Yes yes yes yes yes!!!! I LOVE this place! Crazy delicious food, amazingly friendly service, and their ingredients are pretty good, (some local, etc.) I wish they were open all day because it can be difficult to get out of bed early enough to come here, but it's totally worth it when I do!"}
{"text":"Used the Yelp app to help us find a good breakfast spot outside of the hotel we stayed in and we were not disappointed. Waited about 20 minutes outside on a Sunday morning, which was not too bad (they provided a shaded seating area and cold water bottles while you wait). I ordered the El Paso Omelette which came with a side of hash browns and pancakes and the cinnamon bun. The portions were generous and the menu had many options to choose from. Also, this is a cash only restaurant."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was incredible! Lemon curd pancakes with blueberries. A summer special that should not be missed! Another summer menu item - napolitos omelette - so good! Caprese omelette also a winner. Great service too!  Don't miss this place but get here early on the weekend so you don't have to wait!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast in Phoenix hands down, bring cash but don't worry they have a zero fee ATM. They make you feel like you are eating at your own home. The staff was so friendly and nice what a great find shear luck but even though it is a 35 mile drive I will be back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot! The only downside is having to pay cash only. Unfortunately, I don't carry cash so I had to ask my friend to borrow cash which was embarrassing. Being my first time, I didn't know! The coffee was delicious, fresh and hot. I ordered the eggs Benedict and I was surprised at how tasty it was. The price was also great for the portion size, as well."}
{"text":"My first trip here and it was outstanding. The cinnamon roll with cream cheese icing was sinfully delicious! Also had the Big Gooey Scramble Mess--it had everything you would want in a scramble and more! And the portion size was huge! Tried my friends Apple sausage and it was a sweet savory mouth watering mixture. Staff was friendly and attentive. Lots of smiles. Will definitely be going back! Excellent!!"}
{"text":"Chorizo burrito was awesome!!!! It was the special and there was no disappointments.  My Co worker got the chocolate chip pancakes and they looked amazing. He was happy with them too. Coffee is a tad weak but I do like strong coffee so who knows. Still good flavor. 2nd time here and we will be back."}
{"text":"From the outside this place looks like a run down diner, but it's not! Inside is decorated super cute and the food is delicious! I played it safe and got an omelet (delicious) but got some of the pancakes and they are amazing! The touch of lemon is amazing! Service was great; our server was super friendly and recommended items on the menu as it was our first time there. This place is seriously so great and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"No surprise the reviews are so high for this place. 

Ordered French toast, it was deep fried and delicious. Eggs, sausage and bacon on the side. The sausage was excellent!

Fresh squeezed orange juice. And the coffee is good too. 

Had some of my guest's hash browns and pancakes. Everything was great including the service. Divina helped us this morning and was an absolute pleasure. 

They had a reindeer sausage special that was tempting. Same with a 3-berry French toast which looked good on the table next to me. 

Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Probably the best breakfast I've had in PHX. The French toast is amazing! I had the ooey goeey egg scramble and it was awesome! My wife had Juan's Tacos which she really liked! We will definitely be coming back! The place was packed when we got here so be prepared for a wait, but they were quick to turn tables"}
{"text":"Yum! Solid breakfast joint in the middle of a random strip mall. It can get kinda crazy here over the weekend, so you might be in for a wait, but I've never had to go longer than 15-20 min. 

The staff is all super friendly. They all seem happy as heck to be working there, serve up dishes with a smile, and are more than willing to offer up suggestions from the menu. I've had the linguica with eggs a few times, yum. Perfect hangover cure. I've also had a few bites of the chicken fried chicken which was divine (give me MORE gravy please!)

Also, huge portions for the prices! Nothing on the menu seems to be overly expensive and I always have leftovers for second brunch later. OBH definitely makes getting out of bed after a late night just a little bit easier. Just remember, there will be children, lots of little children."}
{"text":"Just flew into town and found this gem of a place. The food was excellent and the staff were very friendly, happy and welcoming!  You gotta try this one out!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! The best french toast EVER! I am always happy with the food and the service. Cute style, nice location, great staff... I'll definitely be back.."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a laid back, California vibe with an awesome breakfast menu, this is your place.  It's cash only (they do a no fee ATM if you forget), but don't let that hold you back. We came at a 8:30 on a Friday during Spring Training and had no wait. By 9:30 there was a line. 

Service was perfect! I judge breakfast places on how tasty and fluffy the scrambled eggs are , the crispiness of the bacon ordered \"extra crispy\" , the taste of the coffee- fresh not burnt in any way, and the hashbrowns .  Everything we ordered hit the spot!  The homemade pop tart was fun for my daughter (too sweet for me), but it was the most beautiful pop tart I've seen. The pancakes were superb- the other reviewers did not lie. Oh- and I appreciated the selection of coffee creamers - for St. Patty's weekend to see Irish creamer was pretty cool. Speaking of cool, the creamers come in a bowl so you get a nice variety of chilled creamers.  

We liked the Jimmy Hendrix vibe & layout of the restaurant. Clean bathrooms were a plus. This was a fun place for kids. The kiddos at the table next to us had the most beautiful hot cocoa we've seen! Mounds of whipped cream and chocolate drizzle. Ah and the pecan pancakes did not disappoint. If you're visiting from out of town, definitely hit this up."}

{"text":"I would go as far as to say that not only was this the best breakfast I have ever had, but quite possibly the best meal I have ever had. Ever. Not kidding. 

I had banana pecan French toast, and it absolutely blew my mind. Like...I'm hard just thinking about it. They deep fry thick, fluffy bread tossed with vanilla and orange zest and top it with whipped butter, powdered sugar, banana, pecans and syrup. It's mind blowingly decadent. I was sad when it was over. 

My husband had the Juan's Tacos which are made with chorizo and cheese. Also fantastic. The tortillas were delicious and the home potatoes were flavorful and crispy. We jokes about coming back the very next day for a repeat event. So fuggin' delicious. Great staff and friendly, prompt service as well. Our waitress was a hoot. GO HERE!"}
{"text":"This is me and my girlfriends new favorite breakfast joint. Everyone in there is so nice, the food always taste fresh and homemade, and the orange juice is seriously the best I've ever had. I went in today and was served by Mike, we ended up being a little on the needy side, but we were more than taken care of. Everytime he stopped by he had a big smile and was more than happy to grab whatever we neeeed. This is definitely gonna be a place I regularly visit from now on, and Im gonna ask for Mike every time!"}
{"text":"My Dad took me here for breakfast today and it was amazing! I had the Huevos Rancheros which was delish! Everyone I was with really enjoyed their food...great portion and prices :)"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite breakfast place in all of Arizona.
The staff are fantastic. The service is great. The food is fresh.
They try to get as much produce and product locally as possible.
On veterans day they offered free breakfast to the vets.
Everyday is special and they always have new specialty meats.
Clean and homey like a Bed & Breakfast environment eventhough there a lot of people being served. 
Homemade Cinnamon rolls - amazing - lots of other baked goods too."}
{"text":"This is our favorite brunch spot! We eat here probably once a week. We stumbled on it while looking for a breakfast spot that came with high marks in the Acadia District. We never made it here, and have never seen the need to find it since discovering OBH.

The food is so delicious. It's made with care and the best of the best in terms of ingredients. You can taste the difference! I love breakfast food and whether I am ordering eggs, bacon and toast or going for pancakes, this is simply the best food I've found anywhere. The bread is sliced thick and from a bakery. The jam is like homemade. The bacon is thick cut and peppered. The pancakes are delicately flavored with lemon and ever so light and fluffy. The banana pecan pancakes are just delicious. I like to top my meal off with the fresh brewed iced tea.

It just doesn't get better than this and the prices are reasonable to boot! Once you're done here, you can head down the street to \"A Second Look\" for some fantastic consignment shopping."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy coming here mainly for their pumpkin pancakes and their Popeye omelet.  I don't carry a debit card and rarely carry cash.  Because this restaurant is \"cash only\" I probably won't be back.  I eat out frequently and have been to many different restaurants.  I have NEVER  been to one that accepts \"cash only.\""}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. I came here yesterday morning (6-6-16) after an appointment with my 8 year old. After seeing all of the good reviews, I was excited for a hearty, filling, tasty meal. What I got was a waitress who was more interested in everything BUT us, and a bland meal. We were seated quickly, then proceeded to wait (and wait and wait) as our server chatted with a couple in the booth in front of me. I learned that she has been working there for 2 years, she's from Camas Wa, she recommends the french toast, and a few other things. She was not taking an order, as a matter of fact the couple were slowly trying to inch out of the booth and disengage. Finally she came and asked our drink orders. My son got a root beer and I had a coffee and an orange juice. After about another 6 minutes that came out and was dropped off. 

Again, we waited and waited while watching her engage and chat with other customers. It took about 15 more minutes for her to come back to take our orders. We placed them and again waited. After another 10-15 minutes, another woman came and dropped off our food. Our waitress was at another table- yep, chatting.  I cut into my carnitas omelette with green chilis. First bite- dry. Very very dry. And bland. Even salt and pepper weren't helping. I took 3 bites and gave up. The potatoes were okay. My son was very happy with his pancakes at least. Oh, and the OJ was delish. Fresh squeezed and sweet. 

Anyways, I decided to ask for a box to take the omelette home to my oldest son (AKA the Garbage Disposal). It took another 10 minutes to get that and the check dropped off. By this point I was so done. I took the receipt to the register and got out of there. My oldest son tasted the omelette and tossed it out. He said it was weird tasting and dry- and that boy is not picky, lol. 

A few other issues...There were these itty bitty black bugs crawling in and out of the wood window sill, which was dirty. I smooshed a few with my napkin and showed our waitress. No response. The menu was FILTHY and I had both myself and my son go wash up after reading them. (See pictures) I would not go back, nor recommend, sad to say since it's so close to his Dr office.






Edit:  I had a long drawn out response to the owner, but honestly it's not worth it. The waitress was absent, those were not ants, I know what carnitas is, and that omelette was bad.  Sorry, but it is what it is and this is my review. Maybe instead of trying to negate your lower reviews, you could simply say \"We've reviewed you post and are looking into it\"."}
{"text":"This place is AUH-MAZE-ING!!! My boyfriend and I will occasionally go on motorcycle rides, and we decided to make a stop at the Original Breakfast House this weekend.  We went because of the reviews that we saw on Yelp.  When you go, get there Pancakes... HOLY SMOKES they were the most fluffy, most delicious pancakes I have ever had.  They have a hint of lemon in them, and I am bound and determined to recreate these since we live in Chandler and can't come here EVERY weekend.  I can promise you though that we will be back. 

I also don't remember out servers name, but she was the genuinely nicest person that I have ever dealt with.  My boyfriend and I typically have something to say about our servers that we don't like, but we couldn't find ANYTHING wrong with her, she was so sweet, I wish I knew her name to give her a shout out.  And shout out the the owners for having a super clean restaurant and from what I could see kitchen too!

All in all... make the drive, go eat here, it is awesome, and inexpensive.  Definitely get their pancakes  :)"}
{"text":"Visiting from San Diego and we felt like getting something other than the free hotel boring breakfast! Decided to treat ourselves and yelped best breakfast and after scrolling  and scrolling we came across this gem! So glad we did and didn't keep scrolling because everyone says it's crowded with a wait. We knew we would have to wait and it actually wasn't that bad at all! The 20-25 minutes flew by and we were seated and excited to order! I indulged in the pictured Blackberry French Toast with a side of eggs and bacon and a coffee.....all were simply AMAZING!!!! That French Toast was huge and sooooo so very delicious...of course I couldn't finish it. The coffee was so mellow and great as well...great flavor! My husband ordered the Banana Pecan Pancakes with a side of eggs, sausage and home fries....he was so very impressed! Absolutely delicious! The home fries could have been a little more crispy to his liking but they had great flavor and were still yummy! He had the fresh squeezed OJ and although not a fan of pulp he still loved it over some ice and it was awesome that it comes with one free refill which was perfect. My 4yr old killed her kids pancakes and bacon...I never seen her eat so much for breakfast and washed it down with organic apple juice. I took props for my stellar breakfast find and we will definitely be back our next time in AZ!!! OBH is bomb!!!!! Oh and absolutely excellent and friendly service! Well ran establishment!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service... Sammy jo ( our server) was awesome, super friendly staff.  San Francisco French toast is a treat.  My friends also loved their meals, Jose tacos, and hue is rancheros... Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place and I am so glad I did. There was a 25 minute wait on a Saturday morning but it was worth it. Everyone from the hostess to the waitress to the manager checking in tables were friendly and welcoming. And speaking of welcoming- the cinnamon buns and scones in the front case will grab your attention and give you something to look forward to. They looked delicious! We shared the French toast with berries and the Carnitas omelette. Although we were hungry, we could not quite finish our breakfast. The French toast was delicious with plenty of berries. The omelette was filled with tender meat- not spicy at all, but very flavorful. It came with crispy hash browns and toast that we had to leave because we were so full. They serve coffee in a carafe which is a must at a breakfast joint and unlike other places - the coffee was hot.  It's all you want in a breakfast!"}
{"text":"I love the food here! I have tried all sorts of daily specials and very few have been the times where I didn't enjoy it. it has roots in central Cali coast and the people are awesome. there is always a wait for brunch on Sunday and saturday but its always worth it. the fresh squeezed OJ is a must. good local spot!"}
{"text":"My Wife and I have been to many breakfast restaurants in Phoenix over the years. Original Breakfast House is by the far the best.  Great food & great service!"}
{"text":"Nice family owned breakfast spot.  Good food & good service."}
{"text":"I love the fact  that this is a family-owned restaurant and the food is always fabulous. They come up with some great seasonal items from time to time and they are all delicious. just recently enjoyed their Mexican Eggs Benedict.
Their homemade scones and other pastries are also delightful. Well worth the calories."}
{"text":"Typical breakfast spot. Basic breakfast with some surf-themed touches - hanging surf boards, surf and beach pics, and servers wearing tie dye shirts. 

Service was nice. Coffee was strong. Hubby ordered \"The Big Gooey\" which was a scramble with eggs, sausage, onions, mushrooms, and large chunks of potatoes. Huge portion but flavor was lacking a bit. I ordered the French Toast Combo with two eggs and bacon. French toast was two large, crispy, amazing looking pieces of bread. I was hoping for a little more flavor to it, like a hint of vanilla, cinnamon or just something to \"wow\" me. 


Because of the great reviews, my husband and I drove 20+ minutes to dine here and also waited outside on their comfy covered patio for a table for about 20-minutes. We both agreed it wasn't worth a drive across town but it was certainly a good, basic breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Finally a breakfast joint by our house.  Service here is really good and they are friendly.  You also get 1 free refill on your freshly squeezed orange juice.  How cool is that?  Their omelets are great - and homefries are delish - ask for them to be cooked crunchy/crispy.  Their steak and eggs were not very good - the steak was well done and chewy.  I definitely am a repeat customer."}
{"text":"What a treat this place is! The Chip/Rasberry lemon curd pancake was delish. I am sorry I did not get the waitresses name but she was a joy. She had red hair and a sunshine smile though. She gave outstanding service. She did not kick me out either when I got to the part of my book that I just could not put down. I am sure I overstayed my welcome. First world reader problems. lol. In fact everyone who stopped by my table was delightful.  If I lived nearby I honestly would be here every day. 

I know this is random but it touched a nice memory. I laughed out loud and smiled so big when I saw that they have fried Bologna sandwiches on the menu. What a flash from my past, growing up in NY,  grandpa-litte girl spending time together memory there. Not sure I would order it as an adult nowadays though despite the waitress saying it is great and popular. Maybe one day when I am feeling especially nostalgia i will come by and try one. 

Thanks for a nice meal and great service OBH!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place and now it's go time! We were luckily seated upon our entrance to a booth! Our waitress was very nice and suggested the specials as I skimmed over the menu. I decided on the chicken fried chicken two eggs and French toast slice, coffee and a carafe of cold water.
  It was busy but still a few open tables. Service was fast and the food was delicious. The chicken fried chicken with gravy was so moist and flavorful, two breasts! Are the best! The French toast was was great also! The eggs were eggs scrambled. It was all gooood! Lots of choices on the menu. I'm going back again for sure!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for one meal to hold you over all day, say hello to the Original Breakfast House....! 

I love this place because the pricing is very reasonable...not to mention the portions are are on the larger side. 

I got the Chicken Fried Chicken with two eggs. Except I subbed the eggs with hash browns. The meal also came with a deep fried french toast...yummmmmmmmmmy, The hash browns are just perfect... not too oily and crispy. Looks like that is how they cook it, so if you prefer your hash browns on the mushy side, better let them know before placing your order! The entree came with TWO crispy fried chicken. The chicken is breaded and covered in a thick gravy sauce. I could barely finish the first chicken slab....holy cow. It was perfectly breaded and crispy and moist. The french toast with butter and syrup (came as a side) was also delicious. It was the perfect texture of crispy and soft. 

I definitely recommend the freshly squeezed OJ for $3.75. It also comes with one FREE refill. The OJ is pulpy, sweet and just a perfect balance to that heavy breakfast meal. 

You grab your ticket receipt and pay at the front. 

Service was also great. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Friendly service. Came here around noon on a Tuesday. Food came quick and it was amazing."}
{"text":"Went to the Original Breakfast House on a Saturday Morning and it was packed but had to only wait 10 minutes.

The people were very friendly and helpful on assuring everything was right.

We shared the San Francisco Style French Toast, Banana Pecan Pancakes which we ordered with Eggs and Sausage or Bacon. We also had the Hash Browns.

The French Toast was a San Francisco Sour Dough Bread and prepared very well. It taste better than it looks :)

The Banana Pecan Pancakes are fluffy and soft but very filling. The have a very good taste and a touch of lemon.

The Hash Browns are prepared just right with a outer crisp that I like.

The restaurant it's self is not in a great area and the building is not new skills don't expect like a Scottsdale Style Foo Foo Restaurant because it is not going to be here.

Come for the food, will come back to try other items maybe some of the Mexican Breakfast Dishes"}
{"text":"Food is delish. Worth the wait. I had the cinnamon roll pancakes and the Chicken Tinga omelet. I mean, you just got to go!"}
{"text":"I flew all the way from Okinawa and would do it AGAIN! - Yu S on Yelp. 

Well, I didn't end up here just to go to Original Breakfast House, but I give you permission to quote mine me, John. 

The French Toast is fantastic. It's not just a slice of bread; it's thick and softens when it absorbs moisture, but not too soft. It gives me a new standard to judge French toast on. The chicken fried chicken is also delicious. Crispy on the outside, but tender and hot on the inside. Gravy complemented the meat without being too salty. 

The big gooey scramble someone else ordered felt a tad dry, but otherwise great. Personally, I would prefer a little less potato and a little more pepper with salsa or something."}
{"text":"It's one of my favorite breakfast place in Phoenix food is great. The only thing I hate is their water plastic glasses. I believe they're clean but they look dirty from all the scratches.. I see it always busy so means people keeps coming back to this place or they hear of from others. Service is great too. nice people greet you in and out of the door.. this kinda of successful place should have nice clear glasses.. overall, I'll definitely come back to original breakfast house..."}
{"text":"Very busy, extensive menu. Service is adequate for such a busy and popular place. The only issue was out of 8 people, 7 of the breakfast dishes came out extremely greasy. Severely oily with runoff and not very appetizing. The food tasted ok, just lost in the pools of oil."}
{"text":"Love coming here for their French toast! Super delicious! Fresh squeezed orange juice and they give you one free refill. Portions are very large and the price is super reasonable for the portion and taste and quality of food. Just make sure your French toast is nice and fresh if not it can start to taste a little chewy. If it does ask for a new one."}
{"text":"I was not too impressed with this place, but certain aspects were okay. The wait was long, but I'm only giving stars based on the food. I ordered the chicken fried chicken and my friend had the biscuits and gravy. The gravy had a sweet taste which I didn't particularly enjoy and the biscuits were too hard... Not the soft fluffy homemade biscuits I was hoping for. The chicken fried chicken had potential to be good but I didn't think it was great. The chicken itself was super fried and crispy which was nice but smothered in the gravy which was not good. Also, it was all quite bland, definitely needed salt or hot sauce or something to give it some flavor. It came with some French toast which looked like it was also deep fried, but it was pretty delicious. My friend had ordered a cinnamon roll which was very delicious! Soft, fluffy with plenty of icing. If I were to go here again I'd definitely try something else!"}
