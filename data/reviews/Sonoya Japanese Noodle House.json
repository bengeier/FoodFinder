{"text":"Decent uptown Ramen noodles.  Noodle texture was good and broth was tasty.  Would come back."}
{"text":"Really good food really good service. What else can you ask for? I had the king ramen and split three donkatsu spicy between four people and it was lots of food. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Dishes took forever to arrive and food was too salty and cold!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and noodles are ok. A little too much salt that leaves me thirsty for hours. Side dishes like takoyaki are way over priced. I was the least impressed by the service I got here recently. I went with a few of my friends and decided to order something different. I'm allergic to yellow bell peppers and the image did not show them when I ordered it. When it came I told the waiter I couldn't eat it and if it was ok for them to change my order. Not only did she tell me I had to pay full price for a new one even though I didn't touch this bowl of noodles, she got her other coworker to come over and ganged up on me. This type of intolerance especially in regards to allergy concerns are rare these days. Management needs to better train their staff. I will never recommend a restaurant even if they had amazing food but poor consideration for the customers' well-being!"}
{"text":"Went to this Japanese noodle house for our lunch today.  My friend and I both had ordered one Miso ramen and one Shoyu ramen this time. We actually had been here several times but we'd tried out different kind of ramen every time. So far, I love its King's Ramen and I would recommend it too provided if you can really eat spice. The place is not spacious but it has a very Japanese style decor with a delightful ambiance. When our order served on the table, I just couldn't wait to eat my Miso ramen and I almost sipped up everything, same as my friend.... I love eating Ramen so much."}
{"text":"I'm a huge ramen lover, and I would definitely say that Sonoya is not unique, and furthermore, a place I would recommend others to pass on. The food was unimpressive, and the service even less so. I have been here twice, both times ordering different ramen dishes, and felt that both can be easily rivaled. 

It seems they are inconsistent with their spice levels. I ordered spice level of 1 - the different levels are 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 - and the soup was extremely spicy, and was extremely red (with the original being best described as \"beige\"). The next time I went, I ordered ramen with a spice level of 0.5. The soup was \"beige\" and not spicy at all. I asked my friend to try it as I thought that I could be desensitized somewhat, and he is extremely sensitive to spices, and he didn't feel that it was spicy at all. 

In terms of service, I had the same waitress both times I went and she looked extremely unexcited about her job and offered the bare minimum in regards to service. Furthermore, the second time I was there, my friend and I were not able to hold a conversation for at least 20 minutes because there was constant banging coming from the kitchen that completely drowned out our voices. There was no explanation for the noise, and no apology was extended to us. 

I wanted to like Sonoya since I am a big fan of ramen, but having been here twice, I can definitely say that I was unimpressed, and will not be going back."}
{"text":"If u live uptown n don't wanna drive all the way downtown just for a bowl of ramen,  this is the place for you. The pork chop cutlet is the must try item."}
{"text":"On Father's Day, anyone can imagine what a hardship it is to find a table during lunch anywhere. Despite knowing this, I still managed to go to First Markham Place in hopes to eat a decent meal with my dad. Since there are oh-so-many choices and a lot of waiting being done at most restaurants during lunch hour, I decided to try something new. With some consideration of the \"Grand Opening\" banner outside, we chose this eatery for a Father's Day lunch, what are the odds?

-----Food: Appetizing-----
Noodle Omelette  --  At first, I had really no idea what I was going to get, the only thing idea thing that I could relate to was the Japanese Omurice, that is, replaced with some sort of noodles. And I was correct. When the waitress brought me the dish, all I could say is that the presentation baffled me. It was made exactly as shown on the menu with mayonnaise, ketchup and Tonkatsu sauce artfully drizzled right on top of the omelette. Unlike some restaurants, they actually wrapped the omelette around the contents, in this case, the noodles. Speaking about the noodles, I've got to praise a heck lot about it. They were not all stuck together, not too oily, got the right amount of flavoring, has pieces of grilled pork and was decently stir-fryed! The grilled vegetables and sauces from the top of the omelette complimented the noodles well. The best part is, this is actually served with a salad and miso soup. End point: Highly recommended!

Gyoza  --  In terms of frying, they certainly did a good job on it, the bottom was nice and crispy. The skin was thin and not too thick. However, the filling I found average, and just a heads up, there are also Chinese chives wrapped into the filling.

Okonomiyaki  --  Like the Noodle Omelette, it was served exactly as photographed. Its serving is very generous, however it was way too thick. The top and bottom was made well, crispy and topped with sauce. The middle however tasted a bit funny to me. The mixture had cheese (very filling), lettuce, octopus, shrimp and the pink Japanese side ginger. I have no idea why they decided to include the shrimp and ginger, because it made the pancake taste fishy and strange. Generally speaking, I think I would have been much better if there were more lettuce in between the Okonomiyaki. 

Tonkotsu Ramen  --  Pretty darn good! Nowadays, many restaurants don't bother creating different soup bases for each one of their noodles or ramen, and Sonoya begs to differ. The tonkotsu soup base goes great with their noodles and best of all, it wasn't too salty! The tonkotsu (Japanese style pork) itself, was flavourful and the egg--oh my, it was cooked beautifully! 

Shio Ramen  --  The same can be applied from the Tonkotsu Ramen. In my opinion, I thought that this one was a bit lighter in taste and really well seasoned. As a side note, this is also served in a clear soup base. 

-----Atmosphere: Good-----
Partially because it is a new business, so the place is well lit and very clean. The overall decor was done nicely to reflect a modern Japanese noodle house. The chairs and table were at an appropriate height and despite being wooden, they were quite comfortable. Noise level wasn't too bad. And props to them for having AC! 

-----Service: Good-----
There was only one waitress who had a Korean accent, but I felt that she could still proficiently understand English. But I could tell that she still struggled to serve the entire restaurant as lunch hour progressed. Some tables were still left uncleaned, but at the end of the day, she still held through! For the most part she was really nice, and brought the food out quickly while it was still piping hot. 

*-----Final Thoughts-----*
Very happy with this new find, will definitely come again!

{"text":"Ramen consisted mostly of bean sprouts and cabbage, proportionally, had very little noodles. I do not like bean sprouts and it did not state on the menu that there would be bean sprouts in the Ramen, either way... I am pretty sure Ramen should consist mainly of ramen noodles, not cheap veggies. 

Takoyaki was not cooked properly so it was incredibly runny and disgusting."}
{"text":"So I know I said never again in my last review, but this time that I went it was for someone's birthday so it wasn't my choice.

I ordered the tonkotsu ramen and it was much better than the miso ramen I had the first time. It came out nice and hot and was tasty. Fianc√© had the king ramen level 1 spicy and enjoyed it as well.

We came with a large party of 13 and took up most of the space in this small restaurant. There were two waitresses and the man I recognize from the last time served us too (whereas the previous time he just stood behind the cash).

Based on today's experience, I would come back. Hopefully the next experience is like this one and not the first time."}
{"text":"The tonkotsu ramen was really good. The broth creamy. I really liked the broth, the noodles and pork were cooked well too.  Service was fast and the restaurant was full of people. I"}
{"text":"I ordered the King Ramen noodles, at 11.99 plus tax.

The best part about it was the portion size, everything else was not impressive and a bit of a letdown. 

There were several issues.

The noodles were overdone, it was too soft. The soft boiled egg was closer to hardboiled. The three pieces of roast pork had a dry texture and was uninspiring.

The soup needed to be a little more thick.

Overall, this place needs to step their game up. More al dente noodles, truly soft boiled eggs, more tender pork. Thicker soup.  

 There are plenty of better places for the same or less price. Their only saving grace was their generous portions.

Taste : 6/10
Value: 6/10
Service: 7/10"}
{"text":"We came here at 9:00 p.m. on a Friday and the place was pretty deserted.

We ordered the tonkotsu ramen (11.99) and the dumplings (5.99).  After tax it was $20.23.

We had Japanese ramen maybe two weeks ago at Ajisen. This place has a nicer, newer decor.

The customer service was slightly friendlier. My wife thought Ajisen was slightly better but could not really articulate why. I pretty much thought it was the same B-level quality.

The $5.99 dumplings tasted exactly like the type my mom buys and pan fries which is tasty, but I expect better or different than what I can get pre-packaged. To be fair, it wasn't pre-packaged but it tasted almost exactly the same. Also the dumplings were presented pan side up so they appeared flat and stuck together, not a good aesthetic look.

I think we are both ramened out, but Ajisen, Sonoya and Sansotei are almost indistinguishable.

3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"Tonkotsu Ramen, ramen is good, broth not as salty as Ajisen Ramen and boiled egg is just right. Oyakodon, chicken is tender and there is enough juice at the bottom of bowl to mix with rice. Grilled Takoyaki, crisp on outside and soft inside, sauce is tasty but not sure if it is homemade. Okonomiyaki, pretty filling and has lots of octopus and shrimp. It would be better if there is veggie on top and more sauce.  

We went there around 7pm on Friday, surprisingly not crowed at all. It has a few highchairs for toddlers and it is the first eatery we ever visited in GTA where the seat belt is not broken or missed but functional.

With the low traffic, one server is enough and it doesn't take too long for food serving at the table, as you are not eating at the Hong Kong style fast food restaurant. 

In general, it is a clean and quiet, reasonable price and family friendly eatery. We will return again and would recommend to friends."}
{"text":"My husband and I used to come to this restaurant quite frequently, the ramen was chewy, soup was good and I especially liked their Takoyaki.  However, my latest experience was terrible.  First of all, the tea that I was served had bubbles in them and it smelled of soup.  Next when we tried to place an order the waitress told us they don't have Takoyaki even though it's on the menu (and it was what I originally came for).  Next we saw a cockroach on the wall.  The waitress didn't apologized nor responded immediately.  She continued serving others.  I moved my stuff by myself to another table.  The ramen was still chewy but the soup tasted a bit bland as if more water had been added.  My husband discovered a piece of rice inside his paper napkin which was supposed to be new.  There were other signs of the napkin being previously used once he opened it.  We suspected that they were re-using paper napkins.  Enough said, we will not go back anymore."}
{"text":"This restaurant is really small, as typical a local Korean restaurant served by the owners.  Even the big cold freezer is outside the kitchen. You can see the chef coming out once in a while to get his stuff.

As usual I order the Tonkotsu.  The soup is so concentrated.  The egg to my disappointment is fully boiled and no running yolk.  The noodle texture is good.  But the egg, the soup and the noodle is no comparison to Sansotei in downtown.  The price for both of them is more or less the same with Sansotei a bit cheaper.

The service is slow given that there is only 1 server and the restaurant is full and people lining up at the door."}
{"text":"This place use to be own the fellow people that own Kenzo ramen @ Yonge and Steeles.

First off, service was great. The Korean owner is super nice. 

Second, food was great. I ordered my usual King ramen and my partner ordered the miso ramen. 

Mine just have enough spice and the heat is not overly bearing. Portions are great. 

As side item order the tonkatsu. It's nicely fried not oily.

Also ask for additional pickle veg to cleanse the palate."}
{"text":"Food:  average

Service:  very disappointed

If you do try this place.  WARNING:  check your bill carefully because the owner over charges and said their menu is not updated!!!

My friend order the natsu ramen which cost $8.95 and when we got the bill the owner charge her $9.95.  We show the waitress and the owner that their menu clearly shows that the noodle was $8.95.  The owner admit that it was his mistake for not updating the menu but he would not honor the price on the menu and the waitress told us it is only $1 more.  After arguing for 5 mins to get our point across... the owner honor the price on the menu and he was very rude."}
{"text":"Just dropped by on a whim and did not expect much since the restaurant was empty. Was pleasantly surprised and will come again in the future.

Food:
Ordered the chicken tonkatsu and it was delicious. The chicken was nice and crispy with a mild curry. It came with 2 balls of rice, and coleslaw. Great portion size. The waitress also gave us pickled radish to go with it. 

Service:
A small place with only 2 staff. Even then, service was attentive and they came to refill the green tea often."}
{"text":"I have been to a few Raman places recently but this one was my favourite!

Food was great, service was amazing. The restaurant was very clean and the price was right. 

Can't wait to go again! 

Netsu Raman, spicy and delicious!"}
{"text":"Not being familiar with ramen--but having been sorely disappointed at a ramen shop in NYC, we were very excited to have had a chance to try this place.  
My husband and I ordered 2 different ramen, mine being hot and spicy and were were not disappointed at all.  This place was delicious!  The broth was flavorful, the fatty pork melted in my mouth and the veggies were cooked to perfection (I'm not a fan of soft/soggy veggies).  
We were happy to have also had a great meal for less than $25 for both of us!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've enjoyed both the food and service. This place gives delicious Katsu dishes. There are so many topping options to try. The staff was friendly too. Our server was your Asian mom that did cooked you the best food. Well at least that's what it felt like. 

I'd come back here again :)"}
{"text":"A satisfying choice when most other ramen/japanese spots are closed at 3pm for a late lunch!  We had the tonkatsu and shoyu ramens - and we both liked the tonkatsu more as the broth was more rich.  It did taste quite salty near the end though.  Nothing that memorable otherwise.  I am also not a fan of the tea - it smells kinda weird - and I would have preferred the brown rice green tea instead.  Good sized portions and fast and friendly service.  Small restaurant w average decor.  Would come here again for a quick fix!"}
{"text":"Can really say this place is an authentic tasting ramen place. However, for the price you will get large servings and a pretty good meal considering the location of the restaurant.

During lunch they have the ramen plus tonkatsu combo which is a steal. But then again, you get what you pay for. This is a place for a quick bite, but if you're expecting authentic tasting ramen you'll be better off elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came into the restaurant with a group of friends. We had a group of 10 people. Although the restaurant was not too big, there were a few large tables that could tailor for the needs of a crowd. 

On the menu, other than their infamous ramen, there were also rice and some tapas food. There were a few new items on the day we visited, such as the deep fried cheese sticks and deep fried pork cutlets with rice. They looked pretty good in the pictures. The attractive presentation did not only restrain in the photos but also in the reality. When my friends ordered those items, the food looked exactly the same in the pictures. They are pretty consistent in terms of presentation in the photos as well as in the real food order. I am impressed. 

For me, I ordered a seafood yakisoba. It came on a sizzling hot plate with complimentary pickles and soup. The size of the order is big. The noodle taste chewy with quite a lot of variety of seafood. It was yummy. Other than the food, the service was good as well. Waitresses always attended our needs with smiles and they didn't ask us to leave even though we stayed behind chatting with one another after we had finished our meals. I would recommend this restaurant to my friends."}
{"text":"Reading the other reviews, I see everyone has noticed they are usually short staffed (usually 1 waitress for the whole place).  This isn't a big problem for me, I've come here during the day and their usual daytime traffic doesn't really call for an additional staff.  

I find the food to be decent but definitely nothing amazing for me to recommend to a friend.  Rather, it's kind of the go-to place if the place next door is too busy.  I've tried a few varieties of their ramen and honestly, they are all okay.  I personally like the miso and the cheese ramen.  Meals usually come with a small appetizer (some sort of pickled veggies or most recently we had two small sushi roll) which is always a nice touch.

It's a quiet, nice place to have ramen uptown.  Also, since it's an uptown ramen place, tea is free!"}
{"text":"as it turns out Sonoya is essentially Kenzo ramen so food quality I would say is just the same. I have not been to Kenzo in a while, but to me this was the best ramen in Toronto before all the other ramen shops in downtown started sprouting all over the place.They didn't even have Tonkotsu ramen in the menu at that time. When they finally did, I was less than impressed.

For this trip, I got my go-to Kenzo order which is the Sapporo ramen and to be honest it was great to not order the Hakata tonkotsu style ramen for the first time in years, which is the only thing I order in any ramen place. the Sapporo ramen reminded me why  I loved Kenzo in the first place. Loads of ingredients, and I love the smokey charred flavor they get into the bowl. Good broth, nice bite to the noodles. The bowl was huge. I don't recall it being so huge but I think I was more full here than at an AYCE.

Big bonus is there are a lot of food options around the area and in First Markham place, so getting good seats was not an issue. Downside is this area is such a pain to get parking at."}
{"text":"Not the best Ramen Restaurant in the area, but it is a comfortable place to dine casually. Unlike other Asian restaurants at First Markham Place, it is not overcrowded. The new updated menu has Chicken and Pork Katsu meals as well, but I am disappointed that they no longer have Takoyaki."}
{"text":"To my fellow Yelpers, you guys are really going to have to try this place out if you have not already. If you have in the past, you're definitely going to have to give it another try! I rarely give out 5-star ratings, but when you consider the service, price, and food - Sonoya is one of those places that deserve a 5 star rating. 

Although they have recently removed takoyaki off their menu, there are new additions to the menu that are well worth trying. The donkatsu is offered with a variety of unique sauces other than the original and spicy ones, such as the carbonara katsu, snow cheese katsu, and the Italian pizza katsu. Each dish comes with a side of rice, corn, and a salad and the sizing of the donkatsu itself is huge (BIG PORTIONING IS KEY LOL) 

Meanwhile, the broth for the Ramen continues to be rich in flavour and they never cheap out on the toppings. Being a lover for spiciness, my two favourites Ramen dishes include the King Ramen and Netsu Ramen. I feel that Sonoya is one of those few places that can actually make the food spicy but tasty without just saying it is."}
{"text":"The setting is clean and cozy. The food is creative and tasty. We ordered the King Ramen, cheese stick and noodle omelette.  They are really filled.Just wish the cheese stick could be more juicy and with more meat inside."}
{"text":"They say food pictures are usually not representative  of the actual product. In the case of Sonoya, this is also true, except the real product was twice as big as what it was in the menu! I was pleasantly surprised about this 3 star restaurant and had zero expectations. But to my surprise, the pork loin cutlet or chicken breast wasn't dry. Rather, it was crispy and wow, that size of cutlet was amazing!! This is far from the best cutlet I've had (esp when compared to famous pork cutlets found in japan ) but I can't say no to that great bang for my buck! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My favorite chain of ramen restaurants in the GTA. Not too salty, HUGE portions, lots of meat and veggies in the soup. Price wise, it's comparable to other ramen places."}
{"text":"visited this restaurant for dinner and was exceptionally well. i ordered a donburi which came with miso soup and salad which was very filling and pleasing. food was definitely worth it for the price which was also very affordable. 
the restaurant itself is very small but cozy with amazing service and a good place to grab a filling meal. definitely recommend this place if you're in the first markham place area and looking for a good japanese place to eat at."}
{"text":"This place is decent. Of the four ramen dishes we ordered, the best was the omelette ramen. It could have benefited from a little more sauce, but it was the clear standout. 

The other two \"normal\" ramen - King and the other I forget - were good as well. 

I had the vegetarian ramen and it was decent, but I wasn't convinced it was worth $12, especially because it was the same price or more than others that came with meat. The bean sprouts, cherry tomatoes, eggplant, broccoli, tofu,and vegetable broth just lack the flavour I've come to expect from quality ramen. I wouldn't order it again or recommend it.

While I love spicy, I don't have a great tolerance for it. I'd say the \"0.5 spicy\" is a small step above mild. Maybe more like a moderate. 0.25 would have been perfect. 

The takoyaki was quite yummy, although because I don't have it very often, I don't know what the standard is. There was a tiny single piece of octopus inside and the whole ball was kind of soft because there was virtually nothing in it. 

Service on the Sunday afternoon was kind of slow, whether it was being seated at empty waiting tables, ordering, or getting the bill, but it wasn't at the fault of the server. She was the only wait staff there, serving around 10 tables. 

This place is not bad. Not quite a destination or a first choice, but it isn't  a place to avoid either."}
{"text":"I highly recommend!! Super affordable and filling. I went with 3 other friends and received great service. They were super welcoming and kind. I ordered katsudon and was served with miso soup along with salad. All was super tasty + the tonkatsu was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It costed around 11$ - great price for the amount of food given. Overall, if you are ever around the first markham place area, I would suggest visiting this restaurant."}
{"text":"Once you've had really good ramen you can benchmark other places to it. Didn't think this place was good. Cuts of pork were plain and dry. Didnt seem like noodles were made fresh in-house. I had the gyoza ramen and it came with 3 dumplings that were a bit salty. Soup was flavoured with soya sauce. Shiki Menya in Calgary or Sentosei downtown Toronto are better choices."}
{"text":"My BF ordered the Tonkotsu ramen and it was very good.  The soup was slightly on the salty side.  I had the netsu ramen and the spiciness was perfect.  I like how this place serves the noodles in a bigger bowl.  Although one comment was the pork was a big tough and not tender like other ramen places.

Update:  I went back a second time with my mom and would give this rating a 2 star now because I simply had asked the waitress I want less noodles as I wasn't even hungry but just went here anyway because my mom was eating.  Waitress replies back \"I can't do that\" and I asked her why can't you just take away some of the noodles I just can't eat a lot?  She says \"i just can't do that\".....alright ok so never going back."}
{"text":"The Sonoya this once was isn't the same. Believe me when I say it I'm not being harsh. If you're paying 12-20 dollars for Ramen you'd be mad too if the ramen you got literally looked like and tasted like insta ramen. Overall food experience here was bad. Service was okay. The Sonoya that I was once went too has changed. It's simply not what it use to be. The food, and just what it stood for changed"}
{"text":"My friend and I went there during the week for a late lunch.  We were a bit hesitant to enter since there was no one eating there.  We decided to sit down after viewing their simple menu.  My friend had the Chasu Ramen with Pork Broth and Pork Katsu combo, I had the Chasu Ramen with Spicy Pork Broth and Chasu Don combo, we saw the pizza noodle and decided to try that as well.

I have to say that the broths are very good!  The aroma and Colorado are all up to par, the noodle is excellent!  Not soggy at all, instead, a little on the chewy side.  The deep fried pork chop (Katsu) was crispy, the meat was also tender.  The Chasu in the Chasu rice is very juicy and it just melts in your mouth.  I would not suggest the pizza noodle as cheese and soy sauce stir fried noodle don't mix."}
{"text":"This restaurant was quite small but luckily I went in the afternoon on a weekday so I did not have any problems grabbing a table. 
The staff here were very nice. I believe they are Korean. The menu was okay as they had a little bit of everything you could choose from but just not many variations of the same dish. 
Upon first glance, I noticed the large bowl with tons of noodles and large pieces of meat in my tonkotsu ramen. Already a difference in other places where I get small, thin slices of meat typically. The broth was delicious but I was a little thrown off by the somewhat big strips of white onion and cabbage in my dish. I personally don't ever recall seeing these in my previous ramen dishes from other places so needless to say, I left the restaurant with lots of onion lingering in my mouth. 
I didn't hate this place, but I didn't love it either. It wouldn't be my go-to joint for ramen but if I was craving ramen and didn't want to wait for a table in this area, I wouldn't mind popping in here.
I'd come back and try some of their rice dishes though. They look appealing to the eye."}
{"text":"*3.5 stars to be exact*

My fiance and I wanted to meet up with my cousin (he lives in Toronto) for dinner on our second night in Markham, but the fiance's family also tagged along. There was nine of us and I was worried the restaurant wouldn't have enough room for our big party, but as soon as we walked in and I told them nine people the table in front of us had coincidentally eight seats, so all we had to do was pull in another chair. How great!  

As we sat down and I observed, it definitely didn't feel like a typical ramen restaurant. It wasn't very lively or filled with excitement. The prices of the ramen were about $3-$7 cheaper than what you would find in New York City or New Jersey. Most of us had ramen and we also ordered three appetizers to try.

Pork Gyoza - The gyoza was delightfully pan-fried and stuffed with pork and vegetables. I thought it was on par with what we have here in New York City.

Combo Tonkatsu - I'm not sure why they called this the \"combo Tonkatsu\" when there's no combination of meat or anything of that nature. Any way, the Tonkatsu was beautifully deep-fried in crispy panko crumbs, but even with the sauce the Tonkatsu tasted a little dry. 

Grilled Chashu - We got a plate of this and underneath the grilled chashu was mixture of vegetables - bean sprouts, carrots, and cabbage. I liked the grilled chashu. It was grilled perfectly, tender, moist ,and delicious! 

Tonkotsu Ramen - I got the Tonkotsu Ramen which was only $10.95 (definitely cheaper than NYC). It was accompanied with the usual ramen toppings - corn, half-boiled egg, scallions, grilled Chashu and additions of bean sprouts, carrots, and ginger. The ramen was wavy and cooked just right. The broth definitely had a creaminess to it, not salty at all, but could use more pork flavor. Not the worse ramen I've had, but not on my top favorite either. 

The service here was decent, not as poor as some of the reviews say. Sonoya is definitely a good spot to check out if you're not feeling for Chinese or HK Style food everyday.The restaurant itself is pretty clean and so are the restrooms. If you're not a crazy ramen fan there are other dishes you can order for lunch or dinner. 

Will I come back? (that's a question I always ask myself). I think so if I want Japanese food for dinner while I'm in Markham. I think it's worth giving another shot."}
{"text":"I did not enjoy my experience here. I am actually surprised that it has such a good rating. I ordered a don with breaded pork chop cutlet and shrimp....the batter for the shrimp was not fully cooked, as the batter inside was very soft. The porkchop cutlet was soggy...the rice tasted like it was drenched in teriyaki sauce..at the bottom of the bowl was a puddle of the sauce.. The plates were expensive for the quality of the food. I found a hair in the salad as well. We showed the waitress and they didn't even offer a discount. I will not be recommending this place to anyone. If you guys want to wat good ramen or don please make a trip to Toronto. My favorite place to visit is Isshin ramen (think that's how it's spelled)"}
{"text":"The ramen here is delicious and makes the place well worth the visit. The broth is dynamic and flavourful and the pork is deliciously tender and beautifully flavoured. 

Points lost here are for ambiance, as the restaurant would greatly benefit from some music to add some atmosphere. Further, the service was very minimal and made the restaurant feel more like a fast food joint. 

This is certainly not an experience in dining but is a delicious, fast bowl of satisfying ramen."}
{"text":"My rating is actually about a 3.5 star, I've been to Sonoya several times now. Consistently, I have enjoyed their tonkotsu ramen. It's chock full of sodium, but damn, it's tasty. The chashu are thick, grilled pieces of meat that aren't too dry. There is also a healthy amount of fresh veggies which I always appreciate. The ramen sizes are very adequate. I can never finish my bowl and have to give some away or take some home. My boyfriend always orders the combo with the tonkatsu, or crispy pork cutlet. For an additional $5, it's a decently portioned side dish. 

Now onto why it's not rated higher, the service is quite slow. There's one or two people (usually only one) servicing the entire restaurant.  Though it's not a really big space, this means it takes awhile to get your orders in and a little while longer to get your food. This all adds up in the end. 

Overall, it's a decent place to get ramen. $12 for a tasty, well-portioned bowl with a generous amount of toppings isn't something I can complain about.

{"text":"My friend and I ordered the donburi and it was very dry. There was not enough sauce. We also ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen and it was overly salted.

Also, this place has very bad customer service. It took forever for them to take our order and we were the only customers. While I was telling my friend a story, I was interrupted by the server and told us us not to talk too loudly. There was only 1 other table there besides us at that time."}
{"text":"WHAT HORRIBLE, UNFRIENDLY AND SLOW SERVICE!!!  There are a few ramen places in the Richmond Hill / Markham area and this one is by far the WORST.  One waitress to serve the entire restaurant and it looks like it may be one chef in the back too.  I think they are Koreans, not Japanese.  And they don't bother putting your name down if there is a lineup in this small restaurant so be ready to be aggressive with other patrons to get a table.  

As for the food, $12 for a bowl of vegetarian ramen, what a rip off!  As for the other ramens that we did try, the broth was way too salty and fatty and the meat too fatty.  I ordered mild spicy and my friend very spicy but both our ramen broth came out the same spicyness!  Not attentive at all.   

I would suggest going to J-Town or Jyuban instead for superior, polite service, quality authentic ramen and slightly cheaper prices."}
{"text":"SONOYA is a Japanese Ramen place located in First Markham Place, closer to the Mall Entrance - parking is always rather difficult to get in this plaza, but once you find a spot, you literally get to choose from almost 50 restaurants.

Walking in, we were seated right away and we were offered nice hot tea right away as well. We ordered the Pork Katsu Don and Tonkotsu Ramen, both for around $10-$11 each. The waitress tried to explain to us that our choice of the pork katsu don isn't a good one because they're doing a promotion right now for a few dollars more and it's a dish with more meat, rice and noodles and a dish of dumplings if we decide to take a picture and upload it to instagram or facebook - but neither of us had data, and I really wanted the katsu don anyways.

I really liked the katsu don and the sauce it had - I think the chicken katsu was fried just right, but I didn't think it was exceptionally good. The ramen on the other hand was slightly disappointing - I thought the soup was a little too plain and the noodles weren't chewy enough. 

There are quite a bit of options at this restaurant, I might come back to give other items on the menu a try."}
{"text":"Although the ramen here is not really comparable to other ramen joints like Sansotei or Kinton, their friendly service has made up for it, well partially.  This place is on par with places like Ajisen or Kenzo. 

The most impressive looking dish here is their noodle omelette (see pic).  The portion is huge! Their spicy ramen soup base, such as King Ramen or Karashi Ramen, is really spicy -- for an average person who can take moderate spiciness.  

It was not crowded on a Sunday around 1pm, so our group of 9 adults + 2 kids didn't have to wait for a table. All in all, this Korean-owned ramen joint provided a decent lunch meal.  3.5 stars!"}
{"text":"One of my go to Japanese Ramen places in Markham.  Good service but it sometimes gets backed up when too many people come at the same time.  Food is good.    Prices are decent.

My favourite is the Noodle Ramen but there are many other choices.  

Definitely must try it!"}
{"text":"I've actually been to Sonoya at least a dozen times since it opened. My father in law loves this place as he knows the owner Mike from when he used to frequent Kenzo in North York. The noodles are made fresh and they have that satisfying chewiness that I look for. 

Our go-to ramen selection is usually the Sapporo miso ramen, which comes with roasted vegetables (bok choy, broccoli, corn, bean sprouts) which lends a tasty smokiness to the broth. This time I found the broth a tad salty but I haven't always found this to be so. Also the serving size is pretty generous and if we're not starving, hubby and I can usually share the Sapporo ramen and leave satiated. 

They usually have only 1-2 servers, which sometimes seems too few when they are busy. Prices are quite reasonable ($9-$13) for what you're getting. It for now remains one of the two ramen places I will continue to frequent most in Markham. 3.25 stars.

{"text":"Came here spontaneously after my shift today and was pleasantly surprised.
Who knew you could get good ramen in markham??

Right off the bat, the restaurant was near empty and extremely quiet which made a (sort-of) uncofortable environment for my friends and I, especially when we were talking and laughing. The workers play mainstream white music instead of the typical kpop you hear. However, they play it from a scratchy home speaker instead of a store speaker.. so it doesn't sound that great.

Foodwise, I had the tonkatsu ramen which had a huge portion for $11ish. The broth was rich without making me feel sick to my stomach with huge portions of oil coating my intestines. The pork was tender and delicious, and that's coming from somebody who doesn't enjoy eating pork- that's right, even bacon. 
Their menu was quite large, for a ramen house. They had appetizers like takoyaki and okonomiyaki pancakes, which I MUST try next time I return!

One thing.. you can't use a credit/debit card if you don't spend $15 .. really? At one point, I do understand why but usually the stores that do that are stores that don't earn a lot of $ in the first place, and this place seems to be doing quite well in this location especially."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch for the first time and ordered oyako-don (chicken, egg and rice) as well as Takoyaki. It came with a miso soup and small salad. 

I wasn't too impressed by the soup, it was way oversalted, and this is objectively speaking (not even discussing preference). The salad was drenched in dressing and inedible. However, these were side dishes so I wasn't too concerned with them. 

The Oyako-don was average except the rice was soaked at the bottom, almost like I was eating a viscous porridge. The flavour was okay. 

My mom ordered a miso ramen and she noted the soup base was also way oversalted. Portion for the ramen was fairly large so it will definitely fill you up. Nothing special, probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Finally.. i decent ramen place besides Kenzo and Niwatei in uptown!!  I notice the store owner puts Kenzo as well on the business card.  I assume this maybe a sister restaurant of Kenzo.

Before I get to the food, I want to let you know this store is very small and they only have one waitress and the owner working as servers, so getting seated and food might take longer.  But to be honest, the wait is not as crazy as the ones in downtown.

Here comes the food part, I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen with extra noodle and the Gyoza and the extra noodle portion was just about right for me.  The noodles texture is chewy which is a good thing and the soup is full of flavour.  The only downfall was the pork, which was a bit drier (rougher) than the downtown ramen places and for some reason, the extra ramen I ordered wasn't cooked fully.  The noodle was still tangled up together sitting at the bottom of the bowl and that was a bit disappointing.

Besides that, I would say this is a decent ramen place in Markham with average price and barely any wait time, what more can you ask for?!  If you hate travelling to downtown to have ramen and prefer staying uptown, I would recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"Went yesterday for dinner. Yes there was only one person working but the service was great! Food came out quickly. Ordered the Karashi Ramen. It was average, but the portion size is bigger than other ramen places I've been to, so I would say worth the price."}
{"text":"We walk by this restaurant all the time but never decided to come in. Today because Sansotei was closed we ended up Yelping Sonoya and dropped by. 

We ordered two noodles, a Shio Ramen and a Tonkotsu Shoyu, as well as gyoza, tonkatsu and grilled vegetables. 

The food came quickly and was nice and hot. The grilled vegetables came first and was sizzling on a hot plate. It was lightly seasoned with a ponzu sauce and was mostly bean sprouts. The gyozas were done perfectly with a crispy bottom, a thin soft skin, and well cooked meat. Finally the tonkatsu came with a sweet brown curry like sauce. 

The noodles came afterwards with a healthy portion of noodles. The tonkotsu shoyu had a slight soy sauce flavouring and it was perfect. The shio was lightly flavoured with salt. The noodles were also cooked very well. 

Overall a great meal, and a real surprise."}
{"text":"There's a variety of ramen choice, the king ramen was delicious, shoyu was what you would expect. Their okonomiyaki is expensive but good."}
{"text":"This is not a subsitute for downtown ramen. 

Craving spicy soup that night so I ordered the Karashi Ramen - miso based broth with karashi paste. I prefer this over the Neshi/King which is soy-based.

- Broth: not too spicy, interesting flavor reminds me of kimchi
- Noodles: the yellow type, texture was ok but it was salty - so salty that in every bite it just overpowered the soup and other ingredients. (maybe just personal preference but I don't like this type of noodle)
- Vegetables: A lot of bean sprouts and cabbage - kind of like I was eating chow mein. also wood ear and some kelp. 
- Egg: Yolk was not runny! it is just soft boiled like how I make it myself at home. The egg white part was soft and ok though. 
- Pork was soft but a bit too thick cut. 

BF ordered King Ramen 
- soy based spicy broth
- same toppings but with minced pork as well 
- both are large portions

Gyoza - served cold/room temperature. not good. 

Tonkatsu - deep fried pork was okay.. crispy skin and well cooked but just something off about it (coating a bit too thick?)

Overall... Did not like this ramen."}
{"text":"Pretty good ramen, good portions, great service and soup base. We ordered the 2 most popular ramen recommended by the waitress. The spicy soup was the best and tasty. Noodle was fresh. The ramen tasted like a mix of korean & chinese style together. Would come back again for tasty spicy ramen. You can customize on how spicky you want your ramen soup to be. Costs $11-12/bowl :)"}
{"text":"Sonoya is a surprisingly good place to grab Ramen. Is it worth making an effort to get to...no. But if it's on your way to school, work, or wherever definitely worth a try.

Sonoya can't compete with noodle houses such as kinton or sansotei (dt location). However it is a great choice north of steeles. First of service is slow and the food takes a while to come out...very unusual for a ramen house. The takoyaki took 20 mins so use that as a marker.

The ramen itself is good. The broth has a deep and and rich flavour but can get a bit salty. The noodles however while not soggy lacked a certain chewiness you would come to expect. They are generous with their meat toppings as I got 2 large pieces of chashu. 

The takoyaki is what ruined for me. What would have been 3.5 is now a 3. While it looks good with the bonito flakes it has the texture of saggy balls. No lie I only had one small piece of octopus in that thing. every bite I took was a bite of disappointment

It's not a bad place to grab ramen uptown. Just remember to bring cash as there is a minimum of 15 for the machine"}
{"text":"February 8, 2018 - I really liked this place the food was yummy and we got free side order of miso soups. I will go back soon and try the other dishes. 
I ordered the *Cheese Stick Tonkatsu* and my friend ordered the *Chicken Katsu Fondue* we both liked our dishes"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and tried both the ramen and the tonkatsu. The shop might get a little busier on the weekends, but at those times, it's the parking which is more annoying as the entire area is all restaurants.

This time I had the Curry Tonkatsu. It comes as a large Tonkatsu and small ball of rice covered with Curry sauce, and a side of cabbage salad, corn and another ball of rice. The tonkatsu is crispy and the sauce is alright. I kinda wish they gave something different than that second ball of rice though as a side.

The ramen here is alright too. They have pretty large-portioned lunch menu sets."}
{"text":"My co-workers are ramen addicts.  They recommended this place, and we came for lunch.  The menu contains mostly noodles items, a few rice entrees and a few side dishes, such as dumplings, omelettes, etc..  I ordered a shoyu ramen that has meat, seafood and seaweed in a basic soy sauce broth.  The soup base tasted quite delicious.  There were 3-4 slices of  BBQ pork, and they seemed to be made inhouse.  The seafood was basic Japanese fish balls.  The ramen had a bouncey bite to it.  Everything tasted fresh and were of good quality.  

Service was polite but slow.  It took 25 minutes for the 5 bowls of ramen to arrive at our table.

Though not obvious, all ramen can be made spicy.  You just have to specify it when you order.

Overall, 3.5 star"}
{"text":"We came here in a big group.  We ordered ramen, cheese stick dish, chicken and pork culet.  The food is pretty good and better than we originally expected.  The server was polite and serve us quickly.  I ordered a spicy ramen.  It is very spicy and if you can't take the heat, then don't order this ramen.  The spice is good and it is very tasty.  You will get use to the spice after a few dip.  The chicken and pork culet, cheese stivk my friends ordered are also good.  We would come again in the future."}
{"text":"I think the name of this restaurant \"Sonoya Japanese Noodle House\" is a little misleading. You would think they specialize in ramen since they call themselves noodle house. That can't be further from the truth.

In my opinion their Tonkatsu (a Japanese dish which consists of a breaded, deep-fried pork cutlet) tasted a lot better. The ramen here is ok good, but the tonkatsu is awesome!! They should change the name, maybe to \"Sonoya Tonkatsu House\". They also have other katsu dishes like chicken and fish if pork is not your thing. I had the cheese filled tonkatsu which was a great choice, the meat was juicy, cheese was gooey and breaded crumbs was crispy good!! But the little scoop of rice on the side could be a little bit more generous.

I'll definitely come back here and bring my friends.

{"text":"2.5 Stars
Soup broth was very tasteless compared to Ajisen Ramen. There were very little options as really all the ramen bowls were the same but the soup base. Got the Tonkotsu Ramen.  If you add extra noodles for $2.50 the bowl was super sized and I noticed it came with 2 extra pieces of pork meat. Not sure if the $2.50 includes extra meat all the time or it was the bowl I ordered. Appetizers were also limited and expensive. Overall not impressed with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Second time trying this place out and wow my opinion has taken a 180. 

Truly disappointed in the service and lack of friendliness. The food was also just average and would much rather venture to the numerous other quality ramen places. 

My friend ordered Netsu Ramen and requested no onions/green onions but they didn't fulfill this request. I ordered the Sapporo Miso Ramen requesting the same and mines arrived with tons of onions. Also, the flavor of the broth was very meh and lacked depth; there was nothing special about it. Also, the pork was dry and unappealing to eat. I might as well have gone to Kenzo. My friend had also ordered a bottle of Sapporo and after we ate the server attempted to take away her beer when it was not even finish. She never asked but made the assumption. 

This is just the beginning. 
Afterwards, we left and my stomach started to feel really weird. Ended up that I somehow got food poisoning. It was a very unpleasant experience. Later that night, my friend also experienced an upset stomach and resulted in throwing up.

So would I recommend this place? Heck no. If you want to waste your money and have an upset stomach go right ahead. Never coming back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"For sure cannot compare with Sansotei Ramen.  The pork bone soup not rich and too salty.  Broth is big part of ramen noodles.  BBQ pork with too much fat.  
May come back to try their pork cutlet since posters all around the restaurant!  Should not name noodle house if ramen is not that good!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Noodle Omelette since it seemed like a popular dish at Sonoya. The dish was alright, tasted nothing special. The service here is.... not very good. I asked to refill my tea multiple times but the waitresses kept forgetting.  The only good thing about the restaurant was that you can use debit or credit card to pay for your meal."}
{"text":"I came here on Saturday for lunch and there was only a handful of tables the entire time. The seating is adequate.

I ordered the tonkotsu miso ramen (cream pork bone soup with miso) $11- the ramen came with 3 decent sized pieces of chashu, half a boiled egg, ramen, corn, beansprouts and cabbage. The soup base was a little salty but still decent. I was very satisfied with the portion as I tend to leave most ramen places still hungry... the cabbage and beansprouts did help fill me up.

We also ordered takoyaki ($8) for 6 pieces.. this was delicious but I found it a little bit pricey.

Overall, their ramen is quite pricey for something uptown and mediocre (the ramen ranges $9-$14)."}
{"text":"2 friends and I went there around 8:30. The waitress did not bring water/tea until we asked them for it... I ordered the veggie ramen in miso soup base which had grilled tofu, bean sprouts, cherry tamatoes, eggplant in it. Food came in about 15 minutes. 

First of all, good display of food, big portion for about $11 so I was excited to try the taste. Noodles were good, grilled tofu was amazing, other veggies tasted like how they are suppose to taste in miso... but eggplants! Ugh. I normally like eggplant but theirs was so undercooked and flavourless that I just picked them out. 

Everyone in the restaurant got these fried potato, pea starch nugget sort of thing on the house... Lol it was eh. 

Overall, I give it a 3 out of 5. Would go back but there are other places at fmp that I can eat so sonoya might not be my first pick."}
{"text":"Not the most incredible ramen ive had, but its not bad. Don't set your hopes too high for this place in First Markham Place. 

Their service is kind of slow, as they only have 1 or 2 servers on Friday nights for dinner. They also don't accept cards if below $15. 

Their ramen is tasty, but nothing superb about it. Their miso soup base was okay. They have nice ingredients, but again I did not go \"wow!!\"."}
{"text":"They have recently introduced new katsus to their menu. Crispy, juicy and flavourful, a solid Thumbs Up. We usually order the Tomato ramen and the Tonkotsu King ramen and we always leave happy and satisfied. They get creative w/ their dishes with a bit of mozerrella cheese - soft and stretchy cheese, Mmmm! 
Service is very good: Warm, friendly, quick and attentive. We've been to quite a few ramen/katsu restaurants around the GTA and this ranks pretty up there in our book. Though this restaurant is small and unassuming, located adjacent to a more popular crowded Mabu Generation, these people running it know what they're doing :)"}
{"text":"Don't order their ramen, it's pretty decent but the real sleeper is their Katsu dishes. The pork is tender and crispy and the curry is mellow and homey. Their katsu is quite literally plastered all over their walls. Get their Tonkatsu curry dish."}
{"text":"Sonoya is not the greatest ramen restaurant but also not the worst. Overall it's another choice among all the others at First Markham Place. I've been here a few times and I've stuck with the Tomato Ramen.

The Tomato Ramen is made up of a tomato broth and includes tomatoes, minced beef, cheese and some veggies. The broth is pretty good, it's not overly salty and fairly light. I wouldn't consider the noodles to really be ramen but that's not to say it's bad. 

Also recently tried the Okonomiyaki. While it's nice they serve it as not many restaurants do, it's quite forgettable. Decently sized portion but the texture was pretty mushy. Flavor was OK.

Prices range from $9 to $13 for a bowl of ramen which is pretty standard. Sonoya is worth a try; it just might not be a first choice when you're at First Markham."}
{"text":"The have a promotion now that if you take an instagram of one of their new dishes (I think it's the new pork cutlet with rice dish) you can get a discount. When we were ordering the katsu don, they were telling us about this promotion, but we didn't have data so we couldn't post to instagram. We ordered the pork katsu don and the tonkotsu ramen with pork and a level one spiciness. The ramen was okay, it had some flavouring probably from the msg. The noodles didn't taste the freshest to me, but the pork was cooked well, not too dry and a bit fatty which provides some food flavour. The egg was cooked well, not too overdone.

The katsu don I didn't like too much, it was pretty plain, there wasn't enough sauce to cover the dish. The egg and katsu were both pretty bland, over cooked and dry. It wasn't the best don, there are other dons in the area that are quite good.  The prices were a bit higher than what you paid for.

This Japanese restaurant provides a variety of Japanese dishes, but I wouldn't say that they're particularly good at any of those dishes. If you know what you want to eat, I'd prefer going somewhere else, this restaurant does have good options though."}
{"text":"Outstanding!!  Got a pleasant greeting and smile upon entry and the service attitude was refreshing.  The food was awesome...Hot, Fresh, and delicious.  I loved the attention to detail .  Cleanliness is absolutely top of mind.

We will definitely be back.  I totally recommend you give them a try."}
{"text":"I ordered a tonkotsu ramen and was unfortunately disappointed. There was no creamy element to the broth like tonkotsu normally has. It was more like an intense shio-a relatovely neutral flavour in comparison. 

Only thing keeping me from going lower is that the people are nice. However, food and prices charged for the food is a little bit off."}
{"text":"Came here during dinner hour and the place we were planning to go was packed and we had to wait.
I ordered a king ramen(spicy) and it came up pretty quick. I doesn't look bad and the flavour was not that bad either since I finished it all.
However, I'd say this is maybe a Japanese/Korean mixed style noodle? The toppings in it are very different from what you would expect from a ramen, like carrot and cabbage. My friend who looked at this photo I took thought the pork looked ugly, but it actually tastes pretty good! And the amount of meat in it is very satisfying lol
The soup was a little bit too spicy for me so I didn't finish it.

I'd say if you are just craving for noodles, come here! but if you are looking for traditional Japanese ramen taste,  expect it will be different"}
{"text":"They hand make their dumplings/gyoza every Monday, no frozen stuff. We had various kinds of katsu, the meat are tender and good in portion. Well worth trying!"}
{"text":"Came here on a friends recommendation and while I'm not a huge fan of ramen, this was actually not bad. Ordered the king ramen. The bowl is huge and there's lots of veggies included in the soup which I enjoyed. The chashu was surprisingly very tender and thickly sliced which was a plus. We ordered the combo with 4 extra pieces of chashu so I'm glad the meat was tasty. They lacked the option to add extra toppings to their ramen like other ramen shops however. The broth is slightly spicy, but it was quite salty (one of the reasons I'm not too fond of ramen). The roast vegetables on its own lacked flavour, but you could throw it in the ramen. Takoyaki took a while to come out as it was made fresh. There's only a tiny piece of octopus within. It wasn't anything amazing. There was only one server working but it wasn't very busy either when we were there. They offer ramen without broth as well so there's a variety of choices including donburi. Overall not a bad choice for ramen in Markham."}
{"text":"In France, if you were to try to eat between the hours of 3pm and 7pm, you'll be lucky if you can find a kebab shop that's opened. Who would have thought that on a weekday at 3pm the same thing could happen in Toronto? Well specifically for Ramen up north. For some reason we really wanted to eat Ramen on a bleary weekday afternoon and we couldnt find anything that was opened except for Sonoya. We trekked in the small restaurant in FMP cautiously and was welcomed by the hostess and a group of men sitting next to Korean television and just hanging out and drinking - pretty sure one of them was the owner.

So already, we knew that this place is not a japanese joint, but we all know almost all japanese ramen in toronto are not owned by japanese people - the only difference is they dont try to hide it.

The ramen was decent, the gyozas were not good. There were a lot of items like the small donburi rice that were on the menu but was not served - couldnt tell even after asking if it was because they no longer serve it at all, or it was just bad timing as the hostess/server spoke very little english.

It was okay. I wouldnt come back if i had other choices, but given they were at least open, they're okay."}
{"text":"We had a craving for Ramen but didn't want to make the trek downtown for Kinton so we wanted to find a place somewhere in Markham - I am glad that we found Sonoya on Yelp. 

The restaurant is located in First Markham Place where there is still the large white grand opening sign. Inside, it is a nicely decorated noodle house but small - probably seats around 20-30.

So, my wife and I were quite hungry and ordered the following:

Okonomyaki - when I was in Tokyo, this was one of fav things to get. The size here was big but unfortunately the pancake was a bit soggy. Maybe if we let it cook a bit more, the batter mixture would have formed better so the flavour wasn't quite there.

Sapparo miso ramen - This hit the spot - great bowl of noodles with lots of meat and veggie toppings on it. The slices of roast pork were also huge. The soup flavour was good but not too overpowering or fatty. Highly recommend!

Tonkatsu ramen - My wife ordered this one and we were both surprised to see how much pork they gave her. A richer soup flavour compared to the Sapparo but nonetheless good as well. Highly recommend!

Other than the one appetizer, we found the ramen to be good and will certainly return in the future. I am hoping to also try their gyoza and takoyaki. In my opinion, it is the best place in Markham. When compared to Kinton, Ryu and Kenzo, I think this is behind Kinton but ahead of the rest."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner by myself for a quick dinner. Ordered the katsudon which is a fried pork cutlet on rice. Generally speaking with Japanese don, the don should be gererious saused over the don. Then the flavor will mix into the don. 

In this don however, the pork cutlet was not fried to crunchy, the rice did not get enough spice to make the rice flavorful. 

It was a little bit disappointing."}
{"text":"I went here today with my co-workers for lunch. Arrived at 12pm noon. Sat down, was not serviced tea. We had to ask for the cups of tea. Service was terrible, and slow. The waitress doesn't seem like she knows what she was doing, or she was too overwhelmed. Needless to say, we ordered our meals at 12:05pm. Waited for about 30 extra minutes, our food STILL has NOT arrived. We asked why was the food not ready yet? The waitress pointed out she needed to serve \"that table\" first with the 6 other customers. Reality was, during lunch time there were only 2 tables with people in the entire restaurant. It was myself, and my 2 co-workers, and the 6 other customers. Hmm.... now if you operate a restaurant, and you litteraly have 1 chef, isn't that inefficient? I don't know. My opinion. Anyhow, back to topic.... I looked at the clock as seconds start to slip by quicker. I couldn't take it anymore and I told the manager I am not waiting anymore. If I wait anymore, I would be late for work. I left the place with an empty stomach, with my time wasted. I am never coming here ever again. I won't ever get to taste if the food was good or not, but if the restaurant want to waste people's time, and can't make simple raman with premade soup base, then.... I don't know. Maybe I'm just very cynical."}
{"text":"I'll be quite honest and say that not a huge fan of ramen priced at $12+ for skimpy pieces of meat in salty broth. So I ordered the noodle omelette, and to my surprise I LOVED it!! It comes with a side salad for everyone who needs their fix of greens.  The omelette is drizzled with teriyaki sauce and mayo, and underneath that is their stir fried ramen. It's a good amount of food for what it's priced at. 

What's terrible is the slow service, so be prepared to wait longer than average times for your food. Also you need a minimum of $15 before you can pay with debit - which is a first. I can understand credit but it's extremely inconvenient to not accept debit. If you're coming with friends, make sure one of you guys are carrying cash."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good ramen, but the service is extremely slow.  The waitresses are so slow at taking your order and the food takes quite some time to get to you after that.  The ramen and broth is quite good, but it's fairly expensive for ramen at $15.  The portions are small to moderate."}
{"text":"When I walked inside Sonoya Japanese Noodle House, I found the interior quite inviting and pleasant. With just one waitress working, I was a little awkward standing at the entrance waiting to be seated until she noticed I was here.

Menu items reminded me of Kenzo's and when I went on their website, their url directed me to Kenzo's web page. Apparently this location is the 2nd location related to the one up at Yonge and Steeles.

Netsu Ramen ($8.95) was quite filling. I was happy slurping down my noodle which was cooked with a great bite. 

It is great to have Sonoya/Kenzo opens up in Markham. Now I have another option around my area for my Ramen fix.

Cash only unless you spend $20 or more.

Service a little slow.. they really needs to hire some more help!"}
{"text":"Ordered the king ramen. Honestly - not bad. But NOT ramen. More of a Chinese/Korean stew. No balance - just a ton of ingredients - Chinese noodles - bean sprouts, Ground pork, nice serving of pork tenderloin. Pretty strange to go into a 'Japanese restaurant' and be served this. It's probably my own fault though - first markham is a Chinese (some Korean) mall first and foremost, with Chinese clientele who probably like this kind of stew/soup/notramen. It was tasty - but definitely without balance or authentic Japanese flavour. I don't like to leave 2 star reviews - the food was pretty good - but I felt a bit misled by the Name of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I got the katsudon and it comes with a miso soup and a salad. It was 10.99?¬ø The portion was rather small for the price. I've had better for cheaper. I would not come again but if Aka Teppan is full again this is good enough to suffice. 
The customer service was okay. The food came fast, but we were also the only customers here. 
Overall, the food was so-so, not worth the price but passable."}
{"text":"Decent ramen, pretty similar to all the chain ramen places. The noodle omelette was pretty good, something different. There was only one waiter working so had to wait longer for service but he was really nice."}
{"text":"Warning ! Must check the bill, price not same as the menu. The waitress told us price go up, and she asked me to pay for the bill. I was so angry, why I need to pay whatever she ask me to pay? If next time their price go up to 5 or 10$ more, and their meun didn't change , is that mean..I still have to pay for it? Very tricky restaurant, becareful and the OWNER is so rude...."}
{"text":"Too much salt and servers lack enthusiasm and i even saw them sending people away an hour away from closing. (despite having seats available) Servers avoid eye contact and often dissappear, owner walks around like hes king $hit and ignores customers. Otherwise the food is essentially the same as Kenzo."}
{"text":"A couple years ago, Kenzo Ramen operated in a plaza situated close to Sonoya, which I sadly missed when it closed down. It is fortunate to see that Sonoya, being closely associated with Kenzo, does not disappoint when one wants to satiate their hunger for ramen.

The restaurant is conservatively furnished, with the occasional posters regarding ramen placed on the walls. Although Sonoya does not have much space, it doesn't need to; there are fewer line ups in comparison to shops such as Sansotei and Santouka in Downtown Toronto.

I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen bowl which was $10.95, comparable to Sansotei and Santouka. Overall, it was quite decent - the pork had a good distribution of fat and lean meat, none too fatty or tough. While I would have preferred harder noodles myself like those offered at Santouka, they were still quite springy and firm. From my experience at Sansotei, their noodles are not springy as those as Sonoya and Sanktouka, though this is purely subjective. I found that the egg was slightly overdone - the yolk was not as runny and would separate from the white in clumps. The broth was strong and not too salty, but overall comparable to the ones in Downtown Toronto. I found that the pink ginger strips contrasted too much with the other flavours, but your mileage will vary.

As other ramen shops in Toronto, $10.95 for a bowl of noodles is truly quite expensive, but somewhat reasonable. 

While it is nice to have ramen at Toronto, for many people that live in the sub-urbs, it is not good enough to warrant a drive to downtown. Those that live in the Markham and Richmond Hill area and appreciate a good bowl of ramen closeby have finally been granted their wish."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend's to-go for katsu and tonkotsu ramen. The staff here is always so friendly! We come here so often, two of the ladies recognize us and know what we're going to order (tonkotsu & brown katsu with sauce on the side). We tend to come here for dinner, instead of lunch though.

Portions are definitely filling, and food is always on point. Katsu is crunchy, but not oily, comes with rice, corn and cabbage. Chashu (pork) has just the right amount of charred flavour, and the broth is flavourful without being too salty. The boyfriend always drinks all of the broth. Great tonkotsu for first time ramen eaters (but the sliced ginger might throw a newbie off)."}
{"text":"Customer service 10/10, would really recommend the brown katsu it was really delicious, the outer layer was crispy and flaky and the pork was tender and juicy."}
