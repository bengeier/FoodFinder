{"text":"Babylon Cuisine just opened fairly recently, I just happened to see their sign driving past one day and there is nothing much about them online yet. 

Anyway, we got takeout which was a very painless experience. Parking was easy enough (we parked on Hazelwood between Greenfield Ave and Murray), plus there are always street spots by the Giant Eagle. They have a counter that you order at and it is a casual restaurant so you don't feel like you are intruding on anyone's dining experience by picking up food. A really nice teenage girl took our order and prepared it. 

I believe the food is Iranian. They have things like shawarma, falafel, tabbouleh, bread pockets with fillings, etc. Prices are very inexpensive, probably a few dollars less than what Aladdin's charges. My favorite was the beef shawarma which had tender beer slices (instead of the tougher chunks that I've gotten at other places).  The falafel was so-so and could of used some better toppings (pickle was odd)  but the yogurt sauce that came with one of the sandwiches was excellent and they gave you a big cup of it.  

Their bread was perfect, with middle eastern food the bread needs to be on point or the whole meal just ends up being mediocre.  Their bread is delicious, soft and pillowy but still toothy enough to be used in a sandwich without it falling apart. 

Each of the sandwiches came with some average fries. We also liked the pockets (I can't remember the menu name)...the tabbouleh was incredibly fresh but I felt it needed a bit more of a zip...more citrus or something. 

Overall I the price/quality ratio of the food is excellent and I will definitely be back. It is nice to have a quick dinner option in the area that isn't pizza."}

{"text":"We stopped in for lunch on Father's Day.  This is a pretty unassuming new place on Murray Ave. in Greenfield.   The family that runs the business was very nice, and the food was really good.  We tried a few different menu items, to include Beef Shawarma, Chicken Shawarma, and Falafel sandwiches.  We also asked for a special request Beef Shawarma to be made gluten-free with no bread, and that was no problem, as they just served it on a plate, with all the toppings on the side.  Each of the sandwiches also came with an order of fries.  We also tried some of the Sfeeha (Arabic Pies), and an appetizer of Babaghanouj (Middle Eastern Eggplant Dip, which was kind of different from what I was used to.  I didn't like it as much as some other Babas that I've eaten).  Note: We didn't realize the Babaghanouj doesn't come with any bread to dip into it, so I suppose you are supposed to order that separately (They do offer a variety of breads on the menu (We dipped the fries into it instead)).  We also wanted to try some Ayran, a yogurt drink, but they were unfortunately out of that, so hopefully we can try that next time.  Cheers!"}
