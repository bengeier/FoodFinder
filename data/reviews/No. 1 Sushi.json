{"text":"Good place for the price I went lunch time my fav roll was spicy avocado the rest okay my boyfriend doesn't eat sushi and he was happy with the selection he had that pretty rare for us in a sushi buffet.Just don't expect the appetizer picture to look like it (bacon asparagus,beef enoki) but it still good to eat."}
{"text":"This place deserves very high praise - I have zero complaints. They have an extensive menu and all the food we received was delicious. And, as an added bonus, the presentation was wonderful - very creatively and elegantly prepared. Our waitress was knowledgeable, attentive, and extremely efficient.  All in all, it was a fabulous experience and it was very clear that the owners are passionate about what they do. Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great food,great hosts, 110% excellent service and very good ambiance.  I am definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"How this place is ranked 5 stars is BEYOND me.   Because of the amazing reviews, we popped in here last weekend with some friends expecting to be blown away. Our friends arrived first and so they placed an order (it's an all you can eat) while we looked for parking. Upon our arrival (and before their food arrived), we asked for one of those papers you can fill in to order your sushi - the waiter wasn't happy and told us that we had to place our orders as a table so that was a nice first impression of the place. Nonetheless he made an 'exception' and gave us a sheet. Anyway, we looked at the menu and it was really extensive - we placed orders for rolls, sashimi, and some cooked items and anxiously awaited the great food as per all the positive reviews. It took quite a while for our food to arrive despite the restaurant being more than half empty but once it did we found ourselves really unimpressed.  Only a couple of the rolls were good - the rest were really unpleasant. It wasn't necessarily a matter regarding freshness of the fish, but simply the fact that the combinations in the rolls and the way items were cooked didn't work. Any rolls with mango consisted of a sweet syrupy mango concoction that was drizzled all over the rolls rendering them inedible. Rolls with sweet potato tasted like nothing. The list goes on for any 'interesting' rolls we ordered. The more common and safe rolls were fine (avocado, other 1 ingredient rolls, California etc). We also ordered some sashimi which I wasn't impressed with. Here, the salmon had no taste at all and the slices were cut very thick. The cooked kitchen items were either bland, smothered in thick sauces, or simply unappealing and non-identifiable. Several times during the night we found ourselves asking what on earth certain plates were because you couldn't make out many items. Even the ice cream was terrible and that's the one thing you can usually count on... I could keep going on and on but I think you get the idea. Food was at a 2/5 - easily the worst sushi I've had in Montreal.  But, it doesn't stop there. Couple this with the most unpleasant water I've ever had (so much so that I physically couldn't drink it past the first few sips) - not sure what they added to it but it tasted like detergent - and the fact that one of our servers didn't speak a word of English or French, and you'll see why my review sits at a 1/5.   As someone who loves sushi and has done everything from food court sushi to high end sushi experiences, I can tell you that No. 1 Sushi is really not the place to go to if you're looking for good rolls. Even sushi shops in fast food courts offer better tasting rolls than this place - I will definitely not be returning nor recommending this place."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi doesn't get much better than this. Definitely the best AYCE Sushi in the Plateau. Excellent food, excellent service, and the lunch prices are under 20$. Overall great experience here. 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place opened a couple of months ago and let's hope it doesn't get too crowded anytime soon! ;) nice atmosphere, great service by a super nice guy (6 stars for him!!), a tasty food. All that for 24$ per person on a week evening..."}
{"text":"The most average sushi experience ever. Everything about it is average. The lemon water was a pleasant surprise. The service is pretty good. Would consider 4 points if they can change the fry oil more often."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday dinner time and the restaurant was pretty empty. This a all you can eat restaurant. However, we had a a la cart experience.  Overall it is an average. The soup and salad were the same compared with other places. The fried veggi and shrimp were OK but I really like the broccoli tempura. My husband thought they could do better with fresher frying oil. I was like not a big deal.  We had 4 kinds rolls, with avocado, with salmon, California roll and 'rock and roll'. I don't like the 'rock and roll' with BBQ and spicy sauce on, because they are fried and the salmon was cooked inside a sushi roll, which was new and strange to me.  I do think the quality of food can be easily improved if they had more customers coming, but let's admit it, in this area and in the winter time, this restaurant is clearly struggling."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Come for lunch for all-you-can-eat for 15$. I brought many people here and they all loved it. Fresh, tasty, quick service. Would strongly recommend."}
