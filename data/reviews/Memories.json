{"text":"It was horrible, the soup tasted like it came from a can. You can tell it's frozen food. The prices are good but you get what you pay for. I gave it 2 stars only because the staff was outstanding. Think I'll pass on this place in the future."}
{"text":"We took our three kids after staying the night at Hampton Inn and thought the food was very good for the price. The staff was extremely attentive and we fed a family of 5 for $60. Although it's listed as a bar/restaurant, I found it much better than normal \"bar food\" and the portions were huge.  Definitely worth trying if you are passing through Richfield."}
{"text":"I wish I could post a better review but this neighborhood bar is avg. at best. Service is inconsistent as well as the food . Stay away from the calamari. Beer is ok, I guess."}
{"text":"It was good enough! Waitstaff was super friendly and happy to have us. Meat lovers pizza was credible, BLT club had a half pound bacon and the wings for an appetizer were tasty..."}
{"text":"We came here during our stay in Richfield and we were staying at the hotel next door.   We requested outdoor seating and turned out to be the only ones out there. The servers were very friendly and quick to bring us our drinks and food. We ordered side salads that were generous portions and came with a bit more than just lettuce and tomato. They were very fresh and tasty.   We also ordered a BBQ chicken pizza that was generous portion for 2 and it was very good. We had leftovers the next day that were also very good.   We would eat here again."}
{"text":"Fabulous breakfasts! We eat here outside every Sunday after Church. If Evan is your server, ask him to sing some opera for you:)"}
{"text":"Very enjoyable place with a great atmosphere! Erin the bar tender has a great personality and gives great service! I travel that area about 6 times a year and eat there  every nite I'm in that area"}
{"text":"Was there 9am Sun 3/8/15 it is tues 3/10/15 just starting to feel better had the country fried steak......FOOD POSIONING ...this was realy bad ppl almost went to the ER"}
{"text":"Stayed at nearby hotel, only near place to eat. First bartender/waitress was a witch. Rude, rude, rude. Crappy beer on tap. Order bbq wings which I only ate 3 of. Sauce was totally watery and no flavor. The wings are slimy and hard to hold. The word sucks doesn't do them justice. Had sauerkraut balls too. They were huge and seemed promising. Should have known better, they were lukewarm at best. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Nice atmosphere. Just couldn't understand why my soup came out with my entree considering I had put the order in first."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed it here service was great and great good sat at the bar played music one he touch tunes and enjoyed 2-3-4 drinks! D was our server and she was awesome!"}
{"text":"The pizza was great. Prices are reasonable. This is a Bar with a dining area, so can seem noisy at times ."}
{"text":"More like Burnt Memories   It was okay service but the food was terrible my pizza was burnt and my friend's food was poorly made it had tomato on it when we told them no \"tomato\" but there was tomato and the fries were burned like I've never seen before. My other friend's soup was never gonna come out because the waitress didn't check her order, that she wanted the soup so my friend brings it up so the waitress said in a tone \"I didn't know you wanted soup too.\" I only ate half of the pizza because it was so disgusting. I believe the only okay part is the bar because the waitresses and waiters never left the bar."}
{"text":"Memories is the stereotypical diner scene. But, the food is delicious! I'm always excited when I can find a good sandwich and dinner spot. It's very affordable and very welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice mid-afternoon lunch. The waiter was charming and funny. The classic club sandwich was good but almost too tall to eat. The fries were nice and crispy as were my friend's homemade chips. The menu was extensive and it was hard to choose which classic to try."}
{"text":"Located right down the road from our hotel was this bar which served food ....they do have a dining room as well as outdoor dining in the back.  We walked in to the main bar, peopled with locals .....talking loudly, and chose to sit in the dining area (indoor).  The waitress came right over with our menus.  Very friendly, good waitress, fast.  First we got the all you can eat soup and salad bar....2 kinds of soup (I didn't have any but my companion did) and lots of choices at the salad bar including a very delish macaroni salad flavored with dill.  Dill seems to be a big spice here and I LOVE dill!  Next, after looking at the menu, I decided to go with the fried shrimp and fries on the side.  Lots of fries....but they were sort of burnt.  I thought the shrimp was better and it came with a little plastic cup of dill flavored mayo dip (which was quite good).  I got a water with lemon for my beverage and no dessert.    We did have a 10% coupon from our hotel.  Lots of locals seem to eat here and one came in and asked for \"his\" waitress.  So if the locals like it, it's ok.....I mean, it's not fine dining but basic food....  Seemed more bar than restaurant...  Why is it called Memories?  There are pictures of old movie promotions all over the walls....from 1978 Grease back to the 1930's....Memories of movies."}
{"text":"Staff was great!  Food was excellent. My dinner salad was fresh and huge.  Patty melt was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Loaded fries appetizer was delicious and large.  Potato crusted grouper was spot on ... rice was a bit over cooked and did not have much flavor and veggies were not cooked enough to my taste.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Food was okay but the service and bar area are outstanding.  Great place to just hang out and relax with friends."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times and really enjoy it!  They had a great club sandwich and now I get the black bean burger which is usually really tasty.  I came once on a Saturday and it wasn't quite as good.  They also have an eggplant parm sandwich with my DH enjoyed.     Looking for a great salad bar?  They have it!  This is a fun little place and the service is friendly.  Kind of loud at lunchtime but still not a bad place to go with co-workers."}
{"text":"On a recent visit to Cleveland, went here for breakfast after church with my mother and a few of her friends. Food was excellent and very reasonably priced, but the most striking thing was how friendly and efficient the service was. These are some darn nice people."}
{"text":"Stopped in on our way from Colorado to NY. It was late, we were tired and hungry. Sat at the bar and ordered a few beers. Had wings, French onion soup and a veggie pizza. Really great bar food and prices if that's what your into. I would recommend this place to anyone passing through looking for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"This place was great! Super nice stop just off the Turnpike, pretty decent food, amazing server.  Couldn't have been a better traveling stop."}
{"text":"This a very good restaurant and convenient the service is excellent and food is good the menu is vast smothered chicken is excellent.  The bowls are good also the atmosphere is friendly.  Love this place"}
{"text":"I took my wife here for lunch in mid August.  We arrived around 12:10pm and were promptly seated.  We quickly ordered our drinks along with our lunch.  The drinks arrived about 20 minutes later with our sandwiches arriving  1:10pm.  When the food arrived, we requested that the food be placed in boxes as we were late to return to work.  My wife said her chicken wrap was good and my Classic Club was ok.  The tables had different types of memorabilia embedded in the tables. I saw comic books, comic strips and sports cards.)   I provided 2 stars for the food and the atmosphere but the place seriously needs to improve their organization skills.  I say this because the waitresses were running around in a disorganized manor, they were not watching the tables. (I never got a refill on my soda.)  Food was being delivered late by perhaps the bus boys(?) or cook. (I couldn't tell.) We heard other people complain to the staff so I am sure that they know of the problem.  We don't plan to return any time soon but think the place could turn itself around."}
{"text":"Every time good. No doubt. Had it all. Love the chix wrap."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here this morning for breakfast and we loved  the food and service. The atmosphere was inviting and the servers were as pleasant as can be. We were looking for somewhere to eat in town since it was 3 degrees and the roads weren't that safe. This is a wiinner we found by accident. I only gave it four stars because we normally do everything as a family so when we take our kids next time, we'll update our review accordingly."}
{"text":"They've got someone in back that fixes better-than-decent bar food.  Solid bar tender.  TV  placement is weird for a sports bar. Not every seat at the rail is a good one without looking \"opposite\" to 1/2 the crowd. Good not great.  Verging on great not perfect."}
{"text":"I went to Memories tonight for it was right next to the Hampton Inn where I was staying. When I walked in there was no one present to seat me and no sign stating to seat myself. I stood there for a few minutes then sat down at a table across from the hostess stand. I sat there while I watched several workers walk by and no one said a word to me. After about 15 minutes, I decided to leave."}
{"text":"Wings are disgusting. I ordered the cajun dry rub and they were a orange color and tasted like seasoned salt."}
{"text":"Very clean, GREAT enviornment, really good food and close to work! Horray!!!!! I do believe we will do a happy hour next time and I think this place will be where we head to the most because it's doing everything right! Everyone at the table was well satisfied with their selection and gave thumbs up all around! Well done!!!"}
{"text":"I was shocked at how good my dinner was here! I was staying next door at the Hampton Inn and was very skeptical. I became more skeptical when I walked in and the bar was full. I decided to sit on the patio which was nice on a nice evening. I ordered the special of the day~some baked chicken in large noddles with cheese, spinach, mushrooms and red pepper served in a lasagna dish. It was only $11 and came with a salad. Still not sure what the name of it was but man was it delicious! My wife and I just spent $100 on an Italian dinner a couple of weeks ago and I can honestly say this dish was better. The server was friendly and attentive and the beer prices were reasonable. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was the atmosphere. Not bad but not exceptional. For me the food quality, service, and prices rate way higher than that anyway!"}
{"text":"We ordered the fish and chips.  We ate 3 bites and stopped. The server was brand new. At any consolation the owner covered our check and asked us to give them a second try."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great place for breakfast or to watch a football game look no further. Memories has great breakfast skillets and decently priced beers. If you're a Cleveland sports fan this is definitely a neat place to check out."}
{"text":"Well.. As my wife put it, not the worst food I've ever had but I won't be back.  Nachos were not very good. Think hard nachos with a bowl of chili thrown on top. The sandwiches were both lackluster. The fries were good. Hand cut skin on. Very tasty.  The service by Sarah was very good, even with a large tour bus full of blue hairs. She was busy but very pleasant.  There are better places not far from here. Skip this one."}
{"text":"Had a great take out experience! I was really taken back by the quality of the food here. When I walked in and saw a very casual bar, my expectations for the food were pretty low. I got the hot corned beef sandwich with fries. The meat was extremely tender and flavorful and very generously piled on the sandwich. It did not drip any grease whatsoever, yet it was juicy. It was certainly up there on my list of best corned beef sandwiches. The fries were also very delicious. I think they're hand cut or made in house cause they leave the skins on and they were definitely real potatoes. Crispy, yet thick, and perfectly seasoned.  I would def come again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We came in at lunch time. I had the tuna melt and is was excellent!  The service was great. When you don't have a lot of time for lunch it's nice when the wait staff are considerate of your schedule. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Good solid bar food, good but nothing other the top. Fries fresh cut and fried just right. The Philly cheesesteak was good the beer was cold and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"I always enjoy eating at Memories and especially enjoy clambake season & recommend their bakes!  Very good."}
{"text":"Huge portions and the staff was very attentive. We were quite chilly when we first sat down--the fans were on too high--but they were very amenable when we asked to move tables and turned up the heat for us. We all ordered their Eastern European specials--sampler platters and I had chicken paprikash. My mom was quite taken with the spatzel, which she had been craving. The downside is apparently those specials don't qualify for coupons. The upside is that they were delicious! I don't know if I'd ever order their regular menu items, but I wouldn't mind going back to try the goulash, which was delicious!"}
{"text":"Adequate.  Nicely located near several hotels (I was staying a the Hampton Inn).  Better than average selection of beer.  Large selection of food, but the food I had was not great.  If you are passing through and staying in one of the hotels, you could be much worse."}
{"text":"Easy to miss, great casual dining and very nice wait staff.  We always enjoy coming here for lunch and dinner, the food is fresh and well done.  The breakfasts are very good as well."}
{"text":"The Breakfast Bake/Skillets are tremendous and well priced for how much you get."}
{"text":"It has been recently bought by the people that own Cozumel in Broadview Hts.  So there are some new additions to the menu- Mexican ones.  I got the steak tacos.  The steak was beautifully displayed as the component on top.  Looked amazing and tasted great as well.  I would have given 5 stars if the tvs were on."}
{"text":"This is pub food straight-up, prepared quickly from freezer ingredients.  I got a California Club Salad and I have to say that the portion was more than generous.  The bartend(ress) was very attentive and friendly.  I wasn't ecstatic about the beer selection (could add a couple of ambers or some lager) and I was a little creeped out by listening to some of the locals comparing their stints in the local law enforcement domicile (and laughing about it....(imagine the shark music from Jaws)).  Other than that, I think it might have been just fine in the dining room.  One of the redeeming factors is that it had a number of TV's strategically placed around the bar all offering different sports fare."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this place!  We stayed at hotel next door on recent trip.  In talking with the bartenders, the owners make homemade German food.   We had homemade spetzel and pizza for dinner.   Both were good.   I wished I got homemade German sausage plate with red cabbage - next time!!!   Always like supporting a non chain small business!"}
{"text":"The food was just awful, the vegetables were like those frozen microwave steam packs (no flavor or salt, literally), the rice pilaf was just plain white rice, and why were those coming with a smothered chicken?  The only other option was a baked potato.  Because a saw the same awful sides as the only option on other dishes I know I can assume one star"}
{"text":"I'll get right to the point. You have NEVER, repeat Never, had carrot cake until you had it here! It must have weighed a pound and a half!"}
{"text":"Wow.  The rudest bartender i have ever encountered.  Just WOW."}
