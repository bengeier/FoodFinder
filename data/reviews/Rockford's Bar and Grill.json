{"text":"Decent burger and wing joint. Most of the other menu items look like they'll be coming out of a box versus allowing chefs to use fresh and healthy ingredients. Decor needs a major overhaul."}
{"text":"My husband and I have going to Rockford since we moved to King City in September. Love it the atmosphere is quiet and not too busy. My husband loves their Hamburger platter, I can't enough or their Quinoa and shrimp healthy and delicious. I finally found a place that makes a nice Martini. Believe it or not Living in Ottawa for 4 years I couldn't find a venue that made a Martini if I tried. The waitress are amazing always have smile, always make you feel welcome!"}
{"text":"Really good food including burgers and roast beef sandwhich."}
{"text":"I went with a child and 2 other adults for dinner. The service was fantastic! Our waitress was friendly, efficient and attentive. She knew the food well and was able to answer all our questions. The food was either terrific or terrible. However, the good food more than made up for the bad food. We had to start the fried calamari which were soggy and overcooked but the ali-olio dip was fresh and tasty. The nachos with chilli was the BEST nachos we all ever had in our lifetime- how is it so good? Loaded with all the toppings! The deluxe pizza was disappointing at best - a paper thin crust with skimpy rancid toppings. The chicken wings were made fresh, never from frozen, were very \"meaty\" and cooked to perfection with the prefect amount of sauce. There is a half page of the menu dedicated to all the sauces available. We had honey garlic and The Dragon (honey garlic and teriyaki). My child wanted to create his own combo, which the chef was able to accommodate and the chef made the best cheeseburger ever (fresh housemade burgers), chicken fingers and salad were good. The coffee was brewed fresh and the desserts were amazing. We shared the gluten-free almond torte and chocolate lava  cake (which were excellent), the chocolate  was so rich and moist."}
{"text":"Busy restaurant/bar. Live jazz band. In the restaurant.They were very good but too loud to have a conversation. I prefer jazz as background music. We went for dinner good menu but I was disappointed with the quality. My husband had burger and fries. Fries were mushy did not look fresh. I had the steak salad. Steak was good but salad was very chunky. Staff were nice. Don't think I would go back. Not a fan."}
{"text":"Great sports bar/family restaurant.
I usually get the Penne A La Vodka. The sweet potato fries and deep fried pickles are also good. Actually, everything I've tried here has been good and what you would expect.
The wait staff are generally nice but can be slow when it's busy. You tend to get more service in the bar area than the dining area though."}
