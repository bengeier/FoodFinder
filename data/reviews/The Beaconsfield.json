{"text":"DIdn't even know this place existed until a groupon came along. It was indeed a good purchase! 3-course meal for 2 (2apps, 2 entrees, 2 desserts) for $45 (reg price including tax would have been $97 for what we ordered). The prices were fair and they have daily specials from i think 5-7 for $10 and it includes a meal and a pint or wine i think.   The restaurant was a bar type restaurant. Went on halloween night 7pm and it got packed pretty fast. There were only two servers and they were both very attentive. They took their time to explain the menu and our water was always filled without having to ask. Although the place was eventually packed with people, the two servers always checked up on us to see if we needed anything else. Food portions were really good. We ordered the coconut shrimp which was a spicy, milky coconut shrimp soup with shrimp chips on the side, had calamari with roasted vegi, mains included crispy chicken, and angus steak. The flavors were perfect. The chicken and steak were juicy and cooked to perfection. I hate going to places where the chicken turns out to be dry and shrunken or overcooked steak. Dessert was hazelnut cake and banana bread with chocolate chip/ caramel pudding. I'm not exactly a sweets fan but it wasn't too bad. I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night around 10-ish to have a few bevies before putting on some dancing shoes.  It was great! Here's the low down..  - fantastic patio! FYI it closes at 10:30 as it is in the corner of a residential street  - it is very small so don't bring every single one if your friends. It's part of the charm! There were three of us and that was just right! More and I would've felt like we were taking over the place!  - they pour a lot of pints.. A LOT of pints! But the cosmo's were great and not over priced.  - the time we went was perfect so it wasn't super packed, just full.. So I pay that forward. 10 pm folks.  - the volume on the music  (I think this was said before) was absolutely perfect! Well done Beacs!   -....And the music was great! I don't remember the last time I heard A Tribe Called Quest's Benita Applebaum in a bar!!   - sure there were a few pretentious people there, but I find that hard to avoid in a post 25yr old crowd! It's also hard to find a fun vibe where there aren't swarms of \"barely legals\"!   - you'll have fun with the laid back atmosphere it represents here, just dont expect a vibe that it doesn't have and you'll enjoy!   Have fun, it's a great bar!  -"}
{"text":"I'm downgrading because their reservation rule of parties of 6 or more having to pre-order online from a prix-fixe menu is stupid.  Maybe they are trying to dissuade larger groups because it is a pretty small space, but nevertheless, annoying and inconvenient."}
{"text":"This is the place to go for the perfect, high-class burger. Tender, high-quality thick patty topped with melty onions, oven-roasted tomatoes, and melted aged cheddar. I love how the bun does not overpower the burger, and the fries - served in one of those chinese takeaway containers - are the perfect amount to eat without feeling bloated. Side salad of obligatory \"spring mix\" is what it is: There to negate the guilt of eating a burger and fries. The veggie burger is also pretty deece.  None of their stuff is cheap, btw, but if you are looking for the ideal burger, this is a good start."}
{"text":"Oh Man, The Beaconsfield, where do I start. As with most things, there are two sides to the Beaconsfield, and I appreciate them both. On the one hand, it started as the answer to the Drake once it became far too mainstream and suburban, a place for locals. And to that end, it's great. There's no cover, it's a real upscale pub and restaurant. You can get a decent streak or Mac and Cheese at the Beacs, they also have rotating DJs like Justin Peroff from Broken Social Scene and other locals on decks. The bartenders and waitresses are one of the crowd, so they often hang out at the bar when they're not working. On the other hand it's totally a west-end pretentious art joint where you feel silently judged with every look if you're not part of what's considered the in-crowd there. Best nights to go are during the week when the tourists are low."}
{"text":"This place was PACKED! Only two servers, who were also the bartenders, serviced the patio and the inside. Impressed! The food was good, service was great, drinks were worth every dollar.  They have specials every night, and no complaints. Dragged my co-workers here even though our usual place is on King West, they were definitely happy."}
{"text":"Really, what's not to like? The Beaconsfield offers a up a great gastropub menu, and the portions are huge. Prices are approrpiate, the music and atmosphere comfortable and fun. The service was stellar, and food delicious. I recommend the burger, coconut shrimp, and chocolate banana bread pudding. But don't shy away from Salmon, or the Tiriamisu. Everything was well presented and great beer selection. Tip: make reservations, avoid Fri-Sat. Kitchen opens 5-10. Enjoy."}
{"text":"This place is always busy, no matter when you decide to hit the bar.  Partial credit for the early-evening bustle has to go to their awesome happy-hour menu: a meal and a pint of beer for $9?  YES, PLEASE.  The food is so very good (oh, the mac and cheese!), and it's easy to strike up conversations with strangers at the bar.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times... Mostly for drinks. Dim lighting makes it feel cozy and intimate. So last week I decided to check out their menu. We managed to grab the deal from 5-7pm which is 10$ for their special of the day and a glass of wine or beer. We ordered the \"spicy\" wings. I love spice. But, these were definitely not spicy. Overall just okay. Maybe I have to give it another go...."}
{"text":"Great patio, small bar, hipster atmosphere. Friends and I enjoyed some beer and the steak fries are ammmmazzzing! Only thing is that the patio shuts down at 1030 because of a \"city bylaw\" so we left. This is a great sit down place."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to take a friend from out of town and we ended up at this place on a tuesday and a wednesday night after 11pm.    This place has great ambiance and a laid back crowd. The staff is personable and minus any attitude. The DJ plays a mix of old and new music from the 80s to current top 40s to house.    The place is very low key and the people are very chill and down to earth. Its located across from the Drake but there is way less attitude than people who go to the Drake. Its one of my new favorite hang outs. We ordered scotch and dirty martinis all night long.  My friend forgot his credit card there and the bar staff were friendly when we went to retrieve it the next day.  This is a great hang-out and great date place (if you ever need one). The music does get pretty loud later at night so you probably don't want to take a date there at that time if you are planning to have some conversation."}
{"text":"I popped in for drinks with the wife the other day. The Beaconsfield was always a place I told myself I'd go some time and never actually made it there any particular night.  We got there shortly after open so the place was empty. Its beautiful inside and gets perfect scores for decor.  My whisky sour was made well (no sour mix, fresh lemon) and my wife's latte was excellent. We ordered a slice of tiramisu for the heck of it; it came with a whipped cream pouf and a coffee bean on top. The next day I was at Costco with my wife and she was looking at the cakes and guess what was there? The exact same tiramisu cake with the little puff and coffee bean on top. The cake was something like $12 in costco and we paid I think $8 or $10 for a small slice. Kind of put me off from returning to the Beaconsfield to be honest. I dont expect most places to bake their own cakes but there's something in bad taste to me when a restaurant uses a premade grocery cake.  Not sure if I'll return and if I do, it wont be for food."}
{"text":"Great little bar/resto. Nice and relaxed with good food and a good beer selection. Attentive service and relatively quiet ambiance."}
{"text":"This was a more casual dining experience than what I was expecting.  That being said, I really enjoyed the dining experience here.  I ordered the mint crusted salmon and it was perfectly cooked and seasoned - just the right amount of spice.  Best of all was the service.  Casual and not in your face. My dining partner ordered a beer which they were out of but the replacement draft was on the house. Two beers each and two entrees for 70 bucks was good value for the quality and portion  size."}
{"text":"Great location/patio and cheap shots of Jameson w/ a drink order. You also HAVE to try to Mac+Cheese topped with cornflakes."}
{"text":"Good place to have a drink and a bite to eat. The mac and cheese is filling but spicy. I also had the Caesar salad and spring rolls. The bartenders were really nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I was first here years ago, at the invitation of a co-worker who moonlighted as a DJ.   The place was packed, the music was great. But then I never came back.  Cut to Thursday night. A group of lady friends and I are on a mission this summer: to find venues that are great for meeting people on weeknights (and if you want me to be really specific, dudes).  I read here that Thursdays were one of the best nights, so I thought, why not?  The atmosphere was certainly laid-back, as others have Yelped. And wait staff were attentive and prompt. There just weren't a lot of people. We also went at around 8 p.m., so perhaps that has something to do with it.  Not what we expected, and after one wine (which was good!), we went to our next attempt.   I would definitely return - just probably on a weekend."}
{"text":"Holy hipster batman! I'm not in Kansas anymore.  That really embodies the area where this bar/restaurant resides. And inside is no different. The wait staff looks super trendy and so do the patrons.   My friend and I came on a Sunday evening before our departure from Toronto and we were very pleasantly surprised by the food. We ordered the burger and chicken pot pie and both were made of fresh ingredients. They both had a hint of Indian spice flavor. The chicken pot pie's crust was flakey and there was plenty of chicken and veggies to be satisfied.  The place played jazz music for most of the evening and later, dimmed the lights and played more electronic chill music. The vibe was too cool for school with groups of young people and couples alike. I really enjoyed the atmosphere while sipping my Canadian beer and watching the passers by."}
{"text":"While the atmosphere and show were great the service was highly unprofessional and frankly unacceptable. The place was empty when my friend and I walked-in. We asked to be seated at the only table which didn't have a reservation and were told the only place available was at the bar. We happily sat at the bar, for it wasn't a big deal. That was until the next couple who walked in looking for a table without a reservation were told they could have the exact table we previously requested. We heard and saw this before our eyes in complete shock. I was unimpressed by how they could treat customers that way. They knew what they did and they looked at us after to check our reaction. They knew we knew. I will never walk into that place again which treated my friend and I from Montreal so disrespectfully. Be less stuck-up and rude and first and foremost give good customer service. Unimpressed."}
{"text":"Aimer cette endroit est facile. Ancienne succursale de la banque Molson rénové avec goût. Du bois, des banquets spacieuses et des toilettes en quantités au sous sol. Le service toujours attentionné, les barmans et barmaids compétents; je dois avouer que je n'ai jamais été dessus par cette adresse du \" West Queen West \". La sélection de bière en fut est intéressante. Le menu quoique limité permet d'accommoder presque tous le monde. L'ambiance est de type \"hipster cool\"  Cette endroit fut pour moi au début qu'une option lorsqu'il y avait une queue au Drake. Maintenant c'est un de mes classiques à TO. La seule note négative, la nourriture quoique de qualité est trop chère.   :: ANECDOTE, c'est ici que je fut témoin d'un spectaculaire échange de Bar. Le voici en détail :  Protagonistes / Bob un client assis au bar et Jannette une serveuse du Beaconsfield Dialogue / Bob s'assois au bar et en souriant tend sa main à la serveuse :       - Salut Jannette comment ça va? Jannette regarde Bob un peu surprise tout en ayant l'air de se dire \"mais qui es-tu toi\" Bob toujours souriant:    -Je suis Bob on c'est rencontré la semaine passé au Ossington. Jannette sert la main de Bob en lui disant:   -Désolé, je suis sobre présentement! Qu'est-ce que je peu vous servir?"}
{"text":"Did I honestly think a bar/restaurant would be this bumping on a Monday night?!   No.  Did I think the fruits of our 'adventures' in finding a place to have a drink on Queen West would result in such a gem of a find?  No.   Did The Beaconsfield blow my socks off?   YES!  So the night started off with wanting to have a drink someplace new.  My gf and I didn't want the same ol' same ol' so we went on an 'adventure' looking for a place to go.    We've both been to The Drake next door so that was out of the question, but somehow the little Beaconsfield next door seemed to be glowing on an otherwise gloomy street.  The place was packed! The random smoker outside told us we were like two people looking for where's waldo trying to find the entrance which is actually on Beaconsfield and not Queen.  Once inside we managed to score two bar seats as every other seat was taken or reserved.  We ordered two glasses of Rioja and chatted the night away.  The crowd was mixed (my fav kind of crowd) with people on first dates, groups of friends, random old men alone pounding down their stellas at a table for one.   Oh, and did I mention a live DJ in the corner cranking out beats?  oooh yah..  Though we ate dinner before we arrived (3 cheers for all day dimsum!) I was enticed by the menu and want to return to try out some of the food and more of the drinks!  (**The lack of one star is because I haven't tried the food yet!)"}
{"text":"Have a really big beer here on a cold winter evening or a cold beer after a hot summer day at work. Then, order up a burger (veggie in my case) and split a box of fries with your friend.  This will be the best veggie burger ever. Though, I think it might have more to do with the late night and the beer. The Beaconsfield has become a little too mucky-muck (Bay street folks) and a little less relaxed than a few years ago. Sitting at the bar is a fun experience, as people tend to be pretty friendly. Not too expensive, either."}
{"text":"Bartender THREW MY TIP AT ME cause it wasn't enough. Never will I got back here again. I've never been more offended at a bar before. You need to re-hire your bartenders. One was wearing a gray beanie and the other girl looked like Dave Grohl. --- anyway. Me and my two friends spent 20 minutes afterwards discussing how we might have offended these bartenders in the 20 minutes we were sitting there. Please help. We sat at the bar, ordered three beers from tap. We minded our own business and asked for a check. We tried to use the ATM but it wasn't working so we paid the $24 bill with the only cash we had which was $25. This left a $1 tip. Yes, of course it is low, we felt bad, but that's all the cash we had. We come to this bar all the time and always give a generous tip every time. This time we just didn't have the cash. We get up to leave only to have the bartender throw the check and tip at us. It falls on the floor and we turn around and leave. It's not like the bartender spent copious time making a fancy mixed drink. This was 3 draft beers! I don't tip my Whopper artist at BK when they perform an infinitely more complex task than pouring three draft beers. So.... Chill the F out BEACONSFIELD and hire better Bartenders."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food at the Beaconsfield and I would go again. It's a small venue with some tables in the front and a few in the back. We made reservations but due to some unforeseen circumstances,  we didn't get there until 7:30. We called a few times to update them and the staff was very accommodating.   Unfortunately we got a table in the back which was okay but the pretty decor was in the front with the bar and chandeliers and the huge windows overlooking queen st west. Our waitress seemed very detached from her surroundings, didn't smile and interact with us but I notice she was like that with all the tables she Was working.   Appetizers: I ordered the grilled calamari which was okay, the vegetables that came with t tasted much better. My bf ordered the coconut shrimp made with coconut milk, pineapples and spices. This was delicious. It was sweet with a really good kick. He enjoyed it! (And so did I)   Meals: I got the steak with mashed potatoes. This was good. It had a garlic butter on the top and served with vegetables. I wish I got the fries instead cause it looked so yummy when I saw other peoples plates. Dave got the rack of lamb! O.M.G this was so good!!!! They lit the rosemary on fire to serve, so the presentation was there. So sad I missed the photo op! It came with vegetables and toast potatoes. The lamb was done perfectly and the rosemary didn't overpower it nor did the sauce/gravy that I'm not what it was. My bf and I switched plates cause we liked each other's meals better. So glad! I loved the lamb!   Dessert: Dave got the hazelnut chocolate cake, yummmmmm best combination ever! It was a layer of cake and then mouse and a layer of chocolate. I got the banana break pudding! This was amazing. It wasn't too sweet, it was served with caramel sauce and had chocolate chips in it, but not a lot. It was super good.  My experience at the Beaconsfield was great, I'd go again and sit at the bar. It was nice and low key atmosphere and just perfect for date night.   Only problem was a group of girls was seated next to us half way through our meal and one in particular was obnoxious and loud. She spoke of her period, sexual partners and what they need to do to get her into her pants (gold-digger) and called other girls fat when she's not exactly slim and trim Rhonda. This is no fault of the restaurant, but it did make us uncomfortable for part of our meal and instead of wanting to enjoy a glass of wine or cappuccino after our meal or with dessert, we just wanted to leave."}
{"text":"if you own  a westside loft, this is the place for you but BUT the staff is amazing! they've always treated me with the utmost respect, even if i was dressed in rags. the staff is attentive and very charming! as much as i hate yuppies, i still have a blast here getting drunk and the music is upbeat and saucy."}
{"text":"Bought a groupon for a 3-course meal for 2 and made reservations and everything online prior to making my trip. Of course I got to Toronto late and they were more than willing to adjust my reservations time...i went expecting to go to a \"restaurant restaurant\" place but it's more like a bar-ish..anyways, there was only one server for that sunday night around 8pm and he was very nice!!! even tho there was a lot of people he was very attentive and got our orders in asap. Love this place and would definitely return!   Delicious food btw!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Who ever opened this place is a genius and has really great taste."}
{"text":"We went here before checking out a play across the street.  The immediate area seemed to have either upscale quirky restaurants or diners.  This one seemed to be in the middle.  Overall - I think this place is pretty good.  The food prices are reasonable considering some of its neighbors.  We shared the spring rolls, which came out as two huge rolls cut in half.  We also shared two salads, though both were slightly disappointing.  The caesar was made of romaine hearts, but not chopped up.  The beet salad with goat cheese contained very little actual cheese.  Service was exceptional though - both girls working the bar refilled our water more times than necessary and the wine pour was good and inexpensive at $6.  I'd come back here again before another theatre visit.  There was some other good sounding options on the menu.  I get that the place might be not amazing but in terms of comfort and food and service, I thought it was pretty good."}
{"text":"I have been to The Beaconsfeild twice and twice I have ordered their delicious bowl of Southern Mac'n Cheese ($13). It is comfort food at its best. Topped with crunchy cornflakes, the creamy blend of cheese and macaroni with just a touch spice is both warming and welcoming, especially on a blistery winter night.    I love their neo-vintage style and the unpretentious attitude that fills the space. Great place for a date or gathering with friends for dinner.   They have 2 three course pre-fix menu items. The first one is $30 and the second one is $40. A great way to sample an appetizer, entree, and dessert without breaking the bank.  Otherwise entree's are between $13-24.   Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Call me a yuppie, but I like the Beaconsfield. Located in the old Molson's Bank it has a trendy bar kind of feel to it.  I only went for drinks so I cannot judge the food - but I can say the beverages were great and the service was fantastic. Ordering up Jameson and Coke the prices were cheap (I'm from Vancouver and used to paying more than I need to I think!).  I loved the atmosphere best. Arriving at 10pm for my starter drink of the night, it has a dark and intimate ambiance. My friend and I giggled over it being romatical. They were playing great music load enough to drown out the chatter, but not so loud you cannot carry on a conversation - for once a bar with good balance on the volume!  In sum it's a good place to go with a group of friends or for a date."}
{"text":"I was here the other night.  They have dining specials from 5 to 7pm.  For $10 I got a small plate of wings and a glass of house red wine.  A pretty good deal if you ask me.  I also wish it had been a Wednesday b/c the special was mac and cheese and a glass of wine for $10.  That having been said, their mac and cheese is priced at $13 which is still pretty reasonable value.  I dig the decor too.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner and we had an amazing time.  There was only one server/bartender (I either forget his name or he never actually mentioned it) working this evening, but service was still rather prompt and pleasant. We were never looking around wondering where he was, instead he was quite attentive despite the fact it was rather busy for a Monday night. He thought we had ordered two glasses of wine but we had requested a bottle. This was immediately rectified with unnecessary apologies.   We started with a caesar salad, which came out deconstructed (absolutely my favourite salad presentation). It was delicious and the dressing was super garlicy - a good thing in our books. I continued with the chicken supreme and my boyfriend had the steak. Both meals were cooked perfectly, were so delicious and the portions were so generous neither one of us could finish our meal. I've had a lot of chicken supremes in my time, and this was one of my favourites. When I go back, I'll be tempted to order the same thing.   The atmosphere was laid back but sophisticated and nice. Good music played while a bunch of girls celebrated near us and couples swooned over each other and their meals nearby. It's the perfect place for a date, but I'd also come back with friends and family. I definitely recommend the Beaconsfield."}
{"text":"I've been to the Beaconsfield several times. As pubs go it's alright. There isn't a lot of space to sit, it's a small venue. Because of the position of the bar, there isn't much they can really do about that. The upside is there is a quasi-dance-floor of sorts. Mind you, I've never actually seen anyone dance on it.  They usually play the music a bit too loud, so it's hard to have a conversation while you're there. Again, they seem confused about what they are trying to do with the space. All of that said, what makes the Beaconsfield stand out is its food. In particular, its burger. The place could do nothing but sell that burger, and they'd be A-OK in my books. Truly, it is superlative. I don't think i've been disappointed with any of the food i've had there, it's usually all stand out good."}
{"text":"I like this place. It's pretty much impossible to get in during certain hours and best avoided during the weekends -- now more than ever with Queen West being completely out of control -- but if you can hit this place up during earlier hours or during the weekday you won't be disappointed.  There's not really much of a patio happening here. One of those cobblestone outdoor sections with a fence, but the location is quite nice. The food is always bang on when I eat here: the burger is something else and leaves me feeling full and satisfied, and I'm a pretty big lad. The service is usually pretty good pending on who you get. There have definitely been times where I have gone here at night just for drinks and the waitress takes forever to even notice me.  One story I should share happened a couple of years ago. During a Friday or Saturday party some girl smashed a pint glass into another girl's face. Right in front of me. I don't even see that sort of thing happen at dive bars... It was pretty surreal, security moved in, lights came on and everyone was kicked out. Having said that I can honestly say I have never encountered something like this happening again at Beaconsfield. I just thought this was the best forum to share that tale.  Oh, I have also had a lot of meetings at this place. It's small enough that even when it's busy you can still pretty much carry on an important conversation with clients, etc."}
{"text":"Parkdale never fails to impress.  Its good-gone-bad-gone-kind-of-both-ways-now neighbourhood runs halfway between seedy bordering on felonious and upscale Yuppie haven.  Tucked in at Queen and Beaconsfield, is the aptly named Beaconsfield that tends towards the latter.  My first run into Beaconsfield was on the promise of a calamari special.  Every week night, the Beaconsfield runs a special. $8.00 will get you a pint of 50 and calamari, macaroni and cheese, chilli fries, Asian dumplings, or fish and chips depending upon the night.  We showed up on the wrong night and at the wrong time.  It was in fact chilli fries night and we arrived at 7:45pm, 45 minutes after the drink special ends.  Blast.  Undeterred, we took to the menu and came up with burger the burger and fries combo.  Sounds simple but the burgers are truly excellent made up of some combination of meat that I can't make out, unless there's a specific breed of cow out there known as the 'Succulent Angus'.  The fries are of the real potato kind, shoe-stringed and plated in a little Chinese food take-away box.  Cute.  You can also upgrade your fries to poutine if you like, made the traditional real way with actual curd.  Off the food menu, the drinks are not that expensive considering.  Pints of 50 are $5.00 and you can get a $4.50 pint of local-hero Amsterdam Blonde (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/amsterdam-brewing-company-limited-toronto).  Where their scotch list small-to-medium sized, their array of premium tequilas I've not seen matched outside of Mexican restaurants that typically have a handle on things.  If only I could find a client with a penchant for good food, drink, and an expense account.  Oh, dear."}
{"text":"The gorgeous exterior and refined décor created high expectations, which the overall experience didn't quite live up to.  I was hoping for a quiet-ish drink in this attractive building, but instead had to wait for a spot at the bar, and had trouble carrying on a conversation over the throbbing music.  It was entirely my bad for not anticipating that this place would be so clubby on a Saturday night -- I'm leaving that out of the equation.  The drinks were expensive and weak and the service was slow and not particularly friendly.  It wasn't rammed with people so there was no real excuse.  Not a very good selection of beers on tap."}
{"text":"My review is based solely on the food.  I came here with a friend who said \"everything's good.\" I then proceeded to point to the one thing on the menu he'd never tried - the Double-cut Pork Chop. New to the menu (and not even listed online), I decided on this because it came with an offering of seasonal veggies.   And praise the Food Gods, I made the right choice! With a perfect sear on the outside, cutting this pork was like cutting into a steak. Firm outside, it was unbelievably tender on the inside. A velvety texture and perfect seasoning made this pork sing, but it was the demi-glace that made a perfect marriage with this pork. Savory, delicate and only slightly sweet, it added just the right amount of flavor. The side vegetables were also a fine addition, with tenderly cooked asparagus and carrots. The parsnips were a little undercooked and the green beans a bit over. Still, there were so many vegetables, I couldn't have eaten them all anyway.  I am still having flashes of regret about not finishing my pork chop... But there was just too much food.   The salad with pear and pecans was also a great pairing of sweet and salty, with the acid of the vinegar giving balance to the sweetness of the cooked pears. The dressing was a bit overpowering with vinegar when it was not matched with the pears.   Just to note: The pork was cooked medium-well. If you like well-done pork, I guess you'd have to say that when you order. But I like pork that's a bit pink. Honestly - that's how it should be.  Especially when you're getting a high quality Butcher cut."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner recently and was surprised by how expensive everything on the menu was.  A $17 veggie burger? Come on.  Turns out, the portions are HUGE! Unless you have the world's biggest appetite I would suggest splitting a meal with a friend. Once you divide by two, the prices are actually reasonable, though. The food was fine, but nothing earth-shattering. I'd be more likely to come back here for a drink/night out than for dinner."}
{"text":"Jedesmal, wenn der Kellner mit einer Speise durchs Lokal oder in den Gastgarten geht, geht ein Raunen durch die Gäste, denn die Speisen sind relativ üppig, aber auch überaus schön angerichtet. Abgesehen von der Optik sind die Speisen auch sehr gut zubereitet und schmecken hervorragend. Meine Begleitung meinte, dass er noch nie einen besseren Burger gegessen hat. Mein Ziegenkäse-Rote Rüben-Salat mit Walnüssen war auch nicht von schlechten Eltern. Wir haben auch selbstgemachte Frühlingsrollen probiert, die äußerst schmackhaft gefüllt waren.   Innen ist das Restaurant äußerst chic gestaltet. Der Gastgarten ist eher einfach. Die Lage des Restaurants ist in der Queen Street West, einem wunderschönen, jungen, hippen Viertel mit einer enormen Restaurant- und Shoppingvielfalt."}
{"text":"I really like this bar, the vibe is cool and at times too kool for skool.  They pour good drinks here, strong enough for Toronto, and the glassware elevates it above divedom.  It's got enough glass/chandelier to offset an otherwise dark cave.  Okay the food, the $12 burger was well worth it.  Mac and Cheese was incredible...prolly the 2nd best I've ever tried.  The best being at Tillman's Roadhouse in Dallas. The burger from what I remember was juicy enough without being too soggy.  If you want a burger and wanna spend a little more for quality, this is a good place for it without wiping out your budget.  If the US Dollar was stronger, I would say this was well worth it...but we are getting our as#es handed to us in the currency market."}
{"text":"Ah, the Beacs. A Queen West staple for years now. I have so many fond memories there. While it's mostly a place I've been for beverages, I recently had dinner there so thought I'd post a review for that as well.  A welcoming, dark wood, darkly lit space mostly inhabited by the beautiful bar, the Beaconsfield is a trendy but laid back establishment. Dark leather benches, chairs and lots of standing room accommodates an astonishing number of people on a busy weekend night. In the summer the crowd spills out to the small but quaint patio facing the Drake. An attractive, hip, fun crowd is always present.  I've eaten here a few times - menu is small but adequate. I recently tried their veggie burger which was alright. The fries and salad were very nice. My friend had a salmon dish on sweet potato and greens base that she really enjoyed. The veggie spring rolls we started with were a bit lame but conventional. In previous visits I've had the mac and cheese which I enjoyed. A bit above average pub food is what you can expect here. Wine list is decent, cocktails are always good, a full bar accommodates any thirsty palette.  One of my favourite spots in Toronto, it's nice that they do serve food before the party starts but really, go for the party."}
{"text":"Super duper cool spot for drinks. We were walking by and noticed the beautifully lit up bar, dimmed room, flickering candles and dazzling chandeliers. Peeked inside to discover a crowd of a cool looking, attractive, diverse people throughout. We went inside. The place got progressively busy as the evening passed, but there were still places to sit, as most patrons chose to stand near the bar's high top area.  My only complaint is that you had to order straight from the bartender, a difficult feat as the place got more packed as the evening continued. Great, cool spot for a mid-week cocktail and good conversation. Great, chilled out nightlife experience in  Toronto."}
{"text":"It was good.. it is sliding down hill. The burger that was once juicey and great is now overdone. The service is like waiting in a hot desert for a cold beer. Painful. Come Back Beaconsfield.. you were great once."}
{"text":"This place was amazing when no one knew about it. Now the popularity of the drake has forced it to be something it was once not.  You can tell because other bars further down queen don't get as packed or even have a line up on the weekends.  Music is always good (though i always feel sorry for the DJ's lack of space). Space is nice. The patio is a good size so in the summers, it's nice to just be there and get drinks from inside (the patio is not licensed)."}
{"text":"VIBE  A classic Toronto bar right across the street from The Drake. Where Drake lineup spillover goes on the weekends. The best time to come here is mid-week when the \"cool kids\" hang. The owners also own Churchill so it's the same clientele. Sophisticated young professionals and chefs hang out but it's a relaxed albeit dark atmosphere.   I DRINK If I'm going to a crowded bar I usually stick to my classic gin and tonic. But the bartenders are quick and I'm sure they'll make you anything. I've never eaten here.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  A Beacon in the rough."}
{"text":"Their chilli fries are to die for, the vibe is really laid back and lighting is delightfully dim."}
{"text":"Still the worst place to dine. Worst customer service. Food isn't anything special, and servers are not friendly."}
{"text":"A nice and (surprisingly) clean place! The music was pretty cool and I met some interesting characters. The drinks were meh but what can ya say?"}
{"text":"I was first introduced to The Beaconsfield  by some coworkers who are regulars here and know a bunch of the staff. There were a large group of us on my first venture but I still felt right at home. The drinks were poured constantly and the food arrived promptly.  Since that first experience I've always had a good time here. It's a cozy place where you can find a dark corner if you wish or have a cheery round with a group of friends. The staff are always on their toes and will make sure you have exactly what you need."}
{"text":"I hate lines!!  Walking along Queen West of Ossington, seems like most of the bars/clubs have a line.. and Drake Hotel's line just looked unbearable.  Then we passed by The Beaconsfield with no line and the place seemed to be hopping!  The music here was loud... but just have this calming effect... like a background music.  We even able to get a table right by the bar, great place for people watching.  Usual beer selections, nothing too fancy here. Stella $7.50 tax in for a pint, that's what we settled on.  Crowd here seems to be friendly and a little older...and most people were coming in for a quick drink and then just moved on.  Great stop for our night of bar crawling!"}
{"text":"Not my kinda place. I've never been to the Beaconsfield for food, only for nights out, and every time I just haven't felt right being there. Maybe it's the phrase \"upscale pub\". You know, the oxymoron. Either it's a pub, or it's an upscale bar. You can't have both.  Anyway, the Beaconsfield just doesn't have that welcoming attitude that most establishments have when you're spending money to drink alcohol. It's super tiny, so you can't even get inside half the time, plus it's usually filled with self-proclaimed artsy types who get wasted and compare who has less degrees of separation between them and Broken Social Scene members. Sometimes business types will come here straight from work, which also makes me think that I just don't belong here.  I guess if you're into the term \"upscale pub\", you'll like this place. And if you don't want to go to the Drake and pay $10 to get into a crappy DJ night, this place is a good alternative. But if you're anything like me, make sure you're nice and sloshed so you don't notice all the cool people around you."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for The Beaconsfield through rez.opentable.com and when 2 of our party arrived a half hour early there was no issue. It isn't really easy to see the address at night so FYI the entrance is on the side (off of Beaconsfield Ave) not the front facing Queen St. If you go between 5pm-7pm they have a different $10 special every night, which includes a pint of beer or glass of wine. It's a great deal. The place was pretty dark and the seating is rather tight so try to get the booth at the front by the window, that is where we sat and it was comfortable.  The service was really friendly and prompt so we had no problem with that at all.  The food was pretty good, though nothing to rave about. The mac and cheese was creamy and had some zing, it also comes in a half size so you can have it with something else if you don't want to overdose on pasta. The AAA Angus steaks were flavourful if a little tough. The 'curry beer battered fish and chips\" were cooked just right in my opinion, but the only curry to be found was in the tartar sauce. The lava cake was delicious. The restaurant is pretty pricey ($13 for a full serving of mac & cheese, which tasted just 'ok') so I would recommend taking advantage of the early-bird if you can.  They have a small patio which looks like it would be great in the summertime. They also have that annoying 18% gratuity for tables of 6 or more, so beware."}
{"text":"The people that work at this restaurant are extremely rude!!!Especially the blonde waitress... When I approached her for the poor service she proceeded to engage in an aggressive argument with me. I will never go back again!!! P.s.  the braised beef has no salt whatsoever."}
{"text":"Always a great time. Great food, cocktails, atmosphere and service. I love their burger and I don't think the gin cocktail I asked for was on the menu, but the mixologist has made it for me and I absolutely loved it! Thank you for outstanding service!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a drink at the outdoor area. The staff is pleasant and friendly. The wine pours are super generous. Not a bad place to rest a bit and get a drink."}
{"text":"The Beaconsfield is essentially where you go when the lineup to The Drake is too long and you're fed up of waiting. Or where you go when you get tired of the crowd at The Drake.   Having said that, I don't see what there is to like about this place. It has NONE of my four required criteria for a decent bar: 1. Ample seating (there are a few stools and tables I suppose) 2. Reasonable volume (ie you don't have to SHOUT at the person you're talking to) 3. Decent layout (it's terrible here - you are literally ALWAYS in someone's way and are either being tapped on the shoulder to move or shoved out of the way) 4. Appropriate lighting (it's essentially pitch black inside)."}
{"text":"I've oft enjoyed my time at The Beacs.   Their patio is large and fun on summer nights, it's well located and their drinks are reasonably priced.   I popped in recently on a Tuesday to see they had half priced bottles of prosecco. Not a bad Tuesday evening activity. Alas, my happy hour mate was drinking for two, and getting a bottle to myself seemed a touch sad (to do in public at least), so I went with a gin martini. Clink clink!   They do weekend DJs (yeaaaah Tanya), so beware the weekends are a lot more turnt up than a Tuesday. Two different yet equally enjoyable evenings... Whatever my mood, I usually have a terrific and tipsy time here."}
{"text":"Pretty interesting vibe in here and the bartenders are really chill. What sucks is the music is cranked to the maximum, even when there isn't many people around. Who is listening to this music and why do they like it so loud? This, I'll never know. Also, they don't serve beer by the pitcher. Balls, I tell you."}
