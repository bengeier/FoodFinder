{"text":"Noodles are my favorite type of food, and Akki's Udon are one the best I've had. In fact, I love it so much I am a regular there!

I usually get the Akki Udon which is like $7.95 or Tempura Udon is awesome too.

Their Donkatsu and chicken katsu are also delicious. They are not big and juicy like from Japan but it's still very tasty.

During the afternoon they have a lunch menu that consists of various bento box combos. And the best thing about it is you can add a mini-udon on the side!

There weren't many customers on my first couple visits, but they seem to get some more nowadays. I think not many people know about it. So don't shy away from this restaurant! You're missing out!"}
{"text":"Oh Akki!

I used to come here with my wife nearly weekly when we lived in the area!
Great ambiance, friendly staff.  I'm always shocked that the restraunt is relatively low key and low traffic.  Their food is always consistent and great.

They now have expanded their menu to sushi, which is good.  However, their key seems to be cooked isakaya type dishes.  Their hot food is simply delish.

Their udon is always trust worthy and has wonderful garnishes.  My fave is their tempura udon.  Great apps (tried all of them--cannot fault a single one!).  We went so often that they knew me + my wife's order by heart.  I recommend this spot highly.  Definitely a hidden gem in Vaughan."}
{"text":"Izakaya-type (japanese pub grub) resto.  The fried dishes were authentic and reminded me of my 2 weeks in Japan.  Particularly enjoyed the yakisoba okonomiyaki ($17) generously topped with bonito(?) flakes and the fried oysters ($6).  Sauces were authentic (yay wooster sauce!) and fried was crisp, neither oily nor soggy. Sapporo on tap made it fun.  They do serve a limited set of sushi-type meals, but for me the draw is the pub grub.  I've tried the stuff @ Kenzo Ramen and this was superior.  I've been to Guu and though the atmosphere can't compare, the fried dishes can compete and more convenient for those who live up north.  A small joint, open Mon - Sat, closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"Went here the other night and had some really good japanese food.  It was my first time so I asked what was really great on the menu.  Waitress was nice and suggested the udon.

Ordered kakiage udon (waitress suggestion), wakame udon, and okonomiyaki.  Okonomiyaki was very good.  The best I've had in Toronto is at the Okonomi House on Charles st, near Yonge and Bloor, and I have to say it may have been better.  Not as much choice as the Okonomi House, but very good nonetheless.

Udon was also very good.  Subbed out the udon for some buckwheat soba.  Noodles were cooked perfectly, and broth was clean, but flavourful.  Very soothing bowl of noodle soup.

Great place to come to if you're in the neighbourhood.  I'll be going back.  I'm interested in the rice dishes."}
{"text":"I had orginally posted this under the Akki Sushi( it is the same restaurant duplicate entry)

I love noodles, and it's hard for me to find my favourite flavour of noodle too!

Akki has my beloved Japanese-style Curry soup noodle; which has been hard for me to locate elsewhere in the city.  The BF suggested this place in the off-chance of cheering me up after a hideous work week for the both of us.

Akki wasn't too busy, so I said sure - why not and took a look at the menu, and saw the words curry u-don, which I've been craving for a long time. The BF ordered their Yakiniku u-don and we also split a spicy crab sushi pizza to share.

Their curry udon wasn't as soupy as I would have liked, but it satified my craving for japanese curry udon soup noodles and it was loaded with chicken, and veggies that filled me up just right, without me feeling too full.

The Yakiniku udon looked good and the BF said the flavour was there, but it was a bit pricey for what we were paying, but not outragous.

The Sushi pizza was good, but I would probably give it a pass the next time. it was a bit too messy to eat and enjoy at the same time.

Note: 

minor update - I have been back a few times and I have to say my favourite starter is their okonomiyaki with bacon - also they have dropped the grilled skewers off the menu now.  Their specials are worth checking out since sometimes you can get a soup noodle plus maki roll for an additional $2 or $3 charge. They also do the Guu thing where they serve you frozen fruit with your bill. Service-wise is ok, but they don't really check up on you too often."}
{"text":"Akki Sushi & Bar does sound familiar?

I guess that Izakaya experience was not working? 

Complete change of the lunch menu and even their takeout menu now focus on sushi and sashami and rolls.

Change of name, and Change of decoration... hopefully will bring more of us sushi lovers in.

Lunch Specials serves till 3:00 pm is at a reasonable price of $7.95 - $9.95 and their food is much better than Ginza just south of it.

Sushi & Sashimi Bento Box ($9.95) 
- free app is quite delightful  which is a tofu in light sesame sauce 
- miso soup hot and savoury
- Sashimi is thickly cut with 6 pieces includes 2 hamaichi
- California roll is ok, but without the flying fish roe.. and can be roll up a little better
- side salad has this light ginger and sesame dressing!

Overall A-OK experience. Service is fast, great lunch menu with over 10 bento boxes to choose from includes vegetarian choices! I definitely will be back for lunch!"}
