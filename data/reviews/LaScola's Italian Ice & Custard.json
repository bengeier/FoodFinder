{"text":"Cute little neighborhood ice cream and water ice shop. Maybe I'm spoiled by the likes of Page Dairy Mart & Millie's because I found myself wishing for more variety in flavors, but what they did have was delicious! Prices are very reasonable too and the people working there were friendly. I can see us stopping here often as we like to go for walks around the neighborhood or to the park. Next time I am getting one of those gigantic ice cream sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Was lucky enough to be walking along Bryant Street in Highland Park and saw people coming out of a shop I hadn't noticed before.  It turned out to be the new LaScola's Italian Ice Store.  I have tasted their product several times when they have a stand at Farmers'Markets, Vintage Car Rally, Jazz Nights at the Reservoir and even Bryant Street Fair and Bloomfield Italian days.  They also sell their stuff at local markets.
This was their \"soft\" opening with their official opening happening this Friday the 13th!  So, although things aren't quite perfected yet, I did manage to get a taste of their custard and it was great, better than any ice cream I ever had.  Also, their ices can't be touched by anyone.  The flavors are rich and inventive.  They are also serving \"Coffee\" floats.  The vibe was good and it seemed like everyone was having fun."}
{"text":"Had the peanut butter and jelly custard. Outstanding. The place is extremely clean and every flavor I tasted was great . All the best and will be visiting LaScolas often!"}
{"text":"Cute little shop in the heart of a wonderful neighborhood. The inside is beautiful and the people are friendly. Good variety and good quality!"}
{"text":"To my knowledge, La Scola is the only local water ice producer in PGH.  They do not have their own store, but various stores around town sell their water ice, and their stand can be found at many local events.  I've always bought from them directly through their stand, which I've found at Bryant St. Fest, Downtown PGH Pop Up Market, and Bloomfield Little Italy Days.

At their stand, La Scola typically offers a few different flavors of water ice, as well as frozen lemonades.  Their water ice is the best in PGH, without a doubt.  It has a silky texture, and the flavor is refreshing and delicious--though it's pretty sweet, so be forewarned.  Their frozen basil lemonade was less impressive, unfortunately.  Rather than having a slushy texture throughout like a frozen margarita, it's just basil-infused lemonade with some ice blended in that floats on top, making it awkward to drink.

While La Scola's water ice is the best in PGH, I am held back from awarding a perfect rating for a couple of reasons.  First, I'm from DE, which is in close proximity to Philly, the water ice capitol of the USA, so I have exacting standards.  While La Scola's water ice is definitely a cut above Rita's, it doesn't approximate the quality of family owned stands in Philly such as Pop's.  Second, the prices are on the steep side.  In Philly, a small sized water ice around the same size as La Scola's runs $1.75 at Pop's, and has pieces of lemon in it to boot.  On the other hand, it's less expensive than Rita's--but then again, what water ice isn't?  Third, the \"frozen\" basil lemonade needs work (see above).

Despite these criticisms, La Scola's water ice is definitely worth a try, so I suggest picking some up if you happen to see their wares around town.  I don't remember all of the stores that carry their water ice, but I do remember that Groceria Italiana is one of them.  If you frequent the local festivals like I do, you shouldn't have any trouble locating their stand!"}
{"text":"Much needed addition to Bryant street! They have espresso, Italian ice, and custard. You can go inside or if you (like many others in highland park) have your doggo with  you, you can order at the window! Nice family owned business with quality ingredients."}
