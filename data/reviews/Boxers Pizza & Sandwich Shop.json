{"text":"In from Denver and was shuttled by this hole in the wall several times.  My foodie senses tingled and where spot on again!  The food cost less then the uber ride but was well worth it.  Next time in Vegas it's my first stop!"}
{"text":"Ate here Saturday at about 3:30. Got a Hawaiian pizza, 12 fingers, a salad, and a eggplant & parmesan cheese sandwich.   Both my sister and I loved the food. Everything was fresh, delicious, and reasonably priced. We both agreed it was probably some of the best eats we'd had in a while.   The only ding on an otherwise great place is the drink prices -- $1 for a 12oz can. If you plan on dining in, stop and grab some drinks next door at the 7-11."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 14\" pizza's , 1 with pepperoni and jalapeno the other with sausage and extra cheese. They were under cooked  greasy. Ehhh immediate heart attack . Also ordered 16 hot wings. Both pizza's were the worst pizza i ever had! Microwave pizza's are better. The wings looked small and dried up and cooked in a microwave. For $32.00 I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"The best food in Henderson.(AMAZING PEOPLE) every time they deliver to us the food is fresh and Hot and, the lady is so nice I don't order anywhere else but from them. You'll really enjoy there food if I can give 10 stars I would"}
{"text":"A one word description of this place would be MEDIOCRE!!!  The pizza crust was very good, but I am pretty sure that if I owned a Boxer if he or she would get sick from the massive amount of grease on our Pepperoni pizza.  The wings and fries were nothing special and they did not offer fountain drinks.  That is a let down and definitely does not enhance their review.  Also, this place did not seem very friendly.  Granted, we came in an hour before they closed, and ate inside.  They hardly spoke to us, and did not seem happy that we came in.  That is not a good recipe for repeat business.  One positive is that the prices are very reasonable, but I would recommend trying another option."}
{"text":"Gross! Asked for my money back once I saw the cook not wash their hands after touching money, register and phone!"}
{"text":"Best food I have had in a long time. Every thing is so fresh. Clean inside too. Love the tuna fish"}
{"text":"Staff and service: All I can say is ABSOLUTELY AWESOME! My girlfriend and I just moved from the east coast and have been looking for good pizza. Tonight we walked into boxers on a whim, ordered a pizza, and went to the grocery store while it was being made. Little did we know that they closed a few minutes after we left. Came back 30 minutes later and they were waiting for us to give us our order. Amazing, friendly staff! Thank you so much for not only waiting, but being so nice and forgiving about the mishap!  Now to the food: ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!!! We haven't had pizza this good since we moved to vegas. Got the Turbo stuffed pizza. It was full of toppings and we got LOTS of their thick tomato sauce to compliment it. Awesome staff, awesome food, good prices. We will surely be back!"}
{"text":"Boxers is great! Hubby discovered this place a few years ago and we keep coming back..Great pizza..Owner is very nice and professional"}
{"text":"Just moved here a few months ago, but discovered Boxers shortly after arriving. It's easy to miss, so keep an eye out for it! Parking can be tough, but there's a big lot for the 711 next door (711 is going to hate me for saying that).  I've been addicted to their deep dish pizza since the first visit, but I'm slowly forcing myself to work my way through the rest of their menu. So far, I've tried the spaghetti with meatballs, their regular pizza (the $8.99 carryout special), the \"French Fry Frenzy\" and the HUGE baked fresh cookies. I still have a ways to go! They even have a fan in Riverside, CA - the daughter of a friend got so hooked on their deep dish pizza that she begs me to bring her one every week. I sure wish they were open on Sundays, but I guess they deserve a day off every now and then."}
{"text":"By far the best Philly cheesesteak sandwich.  Worth the wait and will call in my order the next time."}
{"text":"Just ordered from this place for the first time today and this pizza is delicious!! I am a huge pizza snob and a red chili pepper freak but it was so good that i didnt even  remember to put chili flakes until the 3rd slice. Well done guys! I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Ice cream delivery! The greatest thing in the world and its Thrifty Ice Cream!!! It's a little pricey but worth it for delivery. Love supporting local family businesses."}
{"text":"A Nice little Independent place on Boulder Hwy. in Henderson.  I initially stopped by for the excellent & affordable Thrifty Ice Cream.  Later on I tried the food menu and was decent and great quality.  A nice change of pace from the regular fast food options...  And they deliver too !"}
{"text":"Doing my best to catch up with reviews... and since I have been home with the flu- I am getting caught up!  I have had Boxers a few times. Great service every time!  I have tried their stuffed pizza YUM-EEEEE  I also have had their chicken fingers and wings - very good. I ordered medium previously but next time I am in the mood for fingers I will totally order the hot.   Pretty good flavor and they serve with home-made ranch! Will have to remember next time to get a couple extras on the Ranch.  Dine in , Delivery OR Take out ... good stuff."}
{"text":"I stopped by to get a pizza for lunch and the gentleman there was very polite and sweet. The pizza is so different and unique from anything I've ever had before. I'm definitely going to keep coming back!! I give 5 stars for their customer service, their fast service, and great food!!"}
{"text":"Had a delivery order of the lunch special dbl cheeseburger and this tasted like a home made burger you'd get at a backyard BBQ. The fries where thick and fresh. I am definitely eating there again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! The owners always ask how we are when they deliver. We order at least twice a paycheck:)"}
{"text":"Anybody who loves boxers and fast cars is cool by me...and the pizza's not bad either. Gonna have to go back for some Thrifty ice cream as well."}
{"text":"Great pizza and good deals! Definitely recommend trying the cheese bread .. DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"I was at the Toy Store next door and we were getting hungry so this was the closest place. The Pizza i ordered was actually decent and the fries were cooked just right.  The place is small, initimate. 3 tables, that sit about 4 each? A pinball machine. Ice Cream parlor. Nice Staff.   The food we had here was good. we enjoyed it a lot, it's just the food didn't have.... anything spectacular to it.. and that is not necessarily a bad thing, just.. it was plain. Delicious. but plain.  I would give it a 3.5/5 if i could."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place after reading the positive reviews on Yelp. I also own a  5 year old boxer named Arizona, so I felt obligated to at least try this restaurant. Unfortunately, the pictures of the cute dogs did not make up for the mediocre food.  This food is comparable to bowling alley food, or food that you may find at your kids  school cafeteria.   We tried their special 1-topping pizza for $8.99 , and a basket of chicken fingers and  fries. The pepperoni pizza we ordered was swimming in grease, the fries were not seasoned, and the frozen chicken fingers were average at best. No fountain drinks  was also disappointing, as we had to purchase individual cans of soda.  I expected this small family owned restaurant to at least provide good customer service. Instead, the staff barely made eye contact with us as we came in and  almost seemed annoyed that we were actually dining in. No one asked us how we liked the food, or if we needed anything else.   Our total bill came out to $20.33, and we had plenty of leftovers. The prices are good -too bad the food is not."}
{"text":"Wonderful food. My family and I have tried quite a few items from their impressive menu. For being a small, hole in the wall, family owned and operated place, their menu is quite impressive. My wife LOVES the roast beef sandwich, she says its the best she's had in years. I am in love with the Stromboli. The homemade marinara is perfect. The chicken wings and fingers are always a favorite for my kids. The fries are the big, chunky ones, always fried perfectly. The pizzas are wonderful as well. I will update with my opinion of other menu items once I try them.  And I'm speaking only for myself now, and my opinions are not shared by the owners of this establishment(to the best of my knowledge). But if you are going to give a negative review of a place like this because the people you gave money to in exchange for food didn't entertain you while preparing your selections, perhaps you should stick to places that offer a show with dinner. I would also suggest you stick to ramen noodles so you can save your money for psychiatric treatment to get to the bottom of why you need constant approval and positive reinforcement. Don't be a fucking baby, just pay the nice people, get your food, enjoy it and move on with your life.   That all being said, if you want great quality at reasonable prices, checck out Boxer's. If you want to be coddled, go somewhere else. Keep the reviews about the food."}
{"text":"Chicken Fingers are bomb bomb. Pizza is pretty good. Delivery rocks!"}
{"text":"The husband should stay far far away form the customers,.  hes rude and obviously angry.  I wanted to really tell him off but I was afraid he would come to my house considering he has my address. If I was married to him and he treated my customers and my buisness that way I would be divorcing his ass.  You lost a regular customer of at least 6 years, and my family will not order from anymore after I told them.  So thats 3 households who ordered from u often for years that you have lost."}
{"text":"Where else can you get a pizza and a Thrifty Ice cream?  Love the place and the food is excellent too.  Priced well and lots of choices for either your ice cream or your pizza.  Pizza is thin crust and the tomato sauce tastes great!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you something, I am a true New Yorker and I know good pizza when I see it. And Boxers pizza by far is the best damn pizza in this whole city! They need to expand and build more places around town. I've been a loyal customer for over 5 years and I recommend this place to EVERYONE!"}
{"text":"I stopped in initially, as I was waiting for my car at a nearby  shop. I'm so glad I did. I ordered  the lunch special of wings and fries (I asked for cheese fries)which were delicious. The wings were the best I've had since my recent move from the East Coast.  I have been back numerous times and the quality is consistent. My favorite is  the Cheese Steak . The roll is really fresh and does not get  mushy due to  oil. The french fries are thick cut and there are enough for two people to share. I'm partial to the cheese steak and order it frequently .  They also sell Thrifty's ice cream in various flavors. Its addictive. Sometimes I visit just to pick up ice cream (for the kids of course)! They have a card that you can get stamped when you purchase ice cream good towards a free cone. I always forget to bring it though.  The prices are fair the establishment is small but clean and the staff are friendly and accomodating. Try it you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Our first time to try this place. We were surprised how great there pizza is. It was absolutely delicious. We had meat lovers,Hawaiian and boxers special. The boxers special was our favorite, it's a must try."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic customer service and pizza. I would be here for any pizza cracks if I lived in the area. From the east coast and only visiting for work so I'll remember for next time!"}
{"text":"This place is in an unassuming location and if you didn't intend to go there you would probably just pass it by.  We went to eat there Tuesday and it was pretty empty inside.  No frills, no fancy place settings, Styrofoam plates and plastic baskets are the dinnerware of choice.    I had the lunch special 10 inch personal pizza and a drink for $6.99.  The pizza is greasy but I attribute that to the pepperoni and sausage.   The crust is crisp on the bottom and the sauce was tasty.  My only beef is that the drinks are cans or 2 liter bottles.  I don't think they get a lot of dine in business so cans work great for carryout and delivery.   If you drink a lot with your meal like I do, cans at $1 apiece gets a little pricey.     My friend had the chicken fingers lunch special.  6 fingers and a basket of fries for $6.99.  They were standard frozen fingers and french fries.   Nothing to get excited about but they were well prepared and tasted good.    Overall it was a good experience and I would go again.   I like supporting a local family owned business and that's even easier to do with good food."}
{"text":"Great food and lots of it!  Cannoli was the awesome topper after pizza, pasta and salad."}
{"text":"Love the Pizza and wings!! And of course Thrifty Ice Cream enjoy dining in and they have fast delivery time. Food is always hot."}
{"text":"Outstanding. My beautiful wife wanted lasagna, so I searched Google maps. Boxers was the first return. I took the family for dine in, and I was thoroughly pleased. Fast, efficient, fresh, family owned, friendly, and tho we didn't even order lasagna, the chicken parmesan sandwich was what the wife settled on. She was happy. Philly cheese steak for me, chicken fingers for the kiddo. Came out HOT N FRESH. Combos with fries, ranch, and drinks stayed under 30. Fast food this is not. I will definitely return. They also deliver. Also, they serve THRIFTY ICE CREAM. Yum. This is my official RECOMMENDATION! DO IT!"}
{"text":"It's not everyday you go to a small local eatery where service is absolutely fantastic! Very nice owners that give you a very warm welcome feeling as soon as you walk in. And the pizza is impeccable! Very delicious and the crust is perfect! I am most certain to come back on my next trip to Vegas:D"}
{"text":"Ordered a pastrami sandwich thought the price was high until i got my order and realized it came with a basket of fries . It was very good , hit the spot . Would recommend to give it a try."}
{"text":"We stopped here randomly the other day and the food was so good! We just got a pepperoni pizza and some chicken tenders and fries but it was all so delicious! They only have a few tables to sit at but it had such a family friendly atmosphere. They also sell THRIFTY ICE CREAM! Which is some of the best ice cream in my opinion! They also said they do delivery! This place definitely scores in every category, so I'd recommend trying them out!"}
{"text":"I have enjoyed their pizza a few times over the last few months, while not exactly the best, its a great place for a to-go pie in this area of town.   they are a small business and met the owner and family crew working and they seem to have a love for the place they run.   Keep up the good work guys.."}
{"text":"Disappointing. I paid $1 for each topping. Got onion, peppers, mushroom, olives and sausage. That would've been fine but when I opened the box, I was like where are the toppings??!!!! I paid $5 for toppings but barely could see any of it. Then the bread was so soggy, I couldn't even pick up a whole slice. Half the slice just fell off cuz it was so wet. The sauce and cheese was just ok. I honestly got better tasting cheese from Little Caesars. But what really bothered me about this was the complete lack of toppings"}
{"text":"The only reason that I gave this establishment 1 star is because it is the lowest form of disapproval they provide.  Both the husband and the wife are extremely rude and do not know the term \"Customer Service\".    My place of business ordered from here all the time and the last 2 times I ordered my co-workers expressed to me that they were fed up with the extreme rudeness from the owners and would no longer order from here.  I had not had such an experience so I continued to order.  I can tell you, that I am the last person in my business that was ordering and we are all absolutely done with these people now.   I ordered on New Year's Day and paid with my credit card.  When the delivery driver came whom was the wife, she allowed another person other than myself to sign my credit card slip and allowed them to tip her on my dime.  I spoke to my co worker and explained that I did not appreciate that and they were apologetic.  Today when I placed my order, I very KINDLY stated that I would like to be the only person to sign for the slip and the woman stated that she didn't have time to wait around.  I explained to her that it is fraud to have someone other than myself sign my slip and that I can legitimately dispute the charges.  And then she said the funniest thing \"Make sure you show your ID and the actual Credit Card upon delivery\".  Really, because you did not seem to care last time about the CC or an ID.  I explained to her about my previous experience and that I was unhappy with their procedure.  I placed my order at 10:00 am and at 11:45 I called back to check on the status of my order being that it had not been delivered yet.  The husband answered the phone and stated that they had been trying to call my place of business for over 30 minutes and that it was busy to tell me that the credit card number that I provided was wrong.  First off, my place of business has over 5 lines and they are never all busy as the same time.  Second, they could have gotten a copy of my credit card upon delivery.  Then he starts to tell me about the conversation that I had with his wife about my past charge and how I could have disputed it.    I personally believe that they intentionally do not place my order.  All I did was stress that I want to be the only signer on my slip.  The husbands seems to think that it is okay to tell customers his sob story that it is just the 2 of them there as I have read the same thing in other complaints below.    It does not matter if the food is good or bad, customer service is key in a small business and word of mouth is poison to such a small business."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the service and food quality. A variety of sandwiches and hot plates. And of course there's the delicious ice cream.  Order ahead, dine in or take out. You'll come back."}
{"text":"This is a great family owned pizzeria. They have a very good verity of food. I'm from the east coast and I can say is  that there pizza comes really close to what pizza tastes like back home !"}
{"text":"I was visiting Las Vegas, and, as I usually do, I consulted Yelp cuz I was in the mood for pizza! I never would have seen this place on my own. Based on the reviews, I headed here.  The pizza was delicious! I also had a dinner salad, a little over priced for the salad I got, but it was good. The staff/ owner was very nice. He gave me the lunch special even though it was past the time!! I really enjoyed myself, especially since I got to enjoy the end of Karate Kid part 3!!! One can never get enough of the moral lessons learned from these movies.  If I ever find myself in this part of Vegas again, and I probably will, I'll be back for some of Boxers delicious pizza!!!!"}
{"text":"I am a nurse at a nearby place and after my co-worker raved about their Philly Cheese Steak Sub we placed an order for the same and another co-worker ordered Chicken Wings. When the order arrived there was a LOT of pepper on the Cheese Steak, so much you could tell it was way over peppered. I am known for not liking spicy food, but when my co-worker tried it she agreed that it was way to much pepper. I was unable to eat it at all because I knew I would have stomach pain later. I called the restaurant up and told him about how peppery the sandwich was. He was very abrupt and talked back to me very loudly stating that he always made the sandwich that way. I mentioned to him my co-worker orders this sub often but he did not want to hear it, and so I let him talk to my co-worker who mentioned to him that she has ordered this exact sub many of times and it was never so peppery. He was quite rude to her and told her that it was only him and his wife there working and that is how he always made it. He told my co-worker 'What do you want me to do. If I make her another sub then there will be just as much pepper on it.\" He then hung up on my co-worker. I called him back and I told him that he was very rude and since it was only him and his wife's he should be able to control how much pepper he puts on a sandwich and make it to the likening of the customer. He yelled at me and was not very business like. Needless to say I will never go and order from Boxers Pizza again, nor will my co-workers, and he can be sure we will spread the word in our facility of over 250 employees. After the conversation on the telephone the other co-worker who had ordered the chicken wings mentioned that the chicken wings were very small, more the size of pigeon wings, and not chicken wings and the fries were cold and when she called him to complain he was equally rude. So it is very sad, especially because this place is a family business, they should strive to be more professional and customer friendly. It is easier to keep a customer then to acquire a new one. It may be true that his pizza is good, but sadly he has very bad bedside manners and he should be ashamed that he treats his customers in such a way."}
{"text":"Will have to try the food soon, but I am happy to have found a shop that carries all the Thrifty's Ice Cream flavors!"}
{"text":"Found this place while at the 7 eleven next door.  Ordered the large sausage plzza and poppers. Lets start with the crust, one word, \"GREAT\" just the right amount of crispness without being too over cooked.  The sauce had a great taste not too overwhelming.  Cheese and meat were ok but I think I will ask for more next time.  This is a good pie and the price is a winner.  It's well worth the return trip"}
{"text":"GREAT pizza with GREAT crust!  I also ordered a dinner salad, which was cold and crisp.  The homemade ranch is fantastic.  Best of all, the service is extremely friendly.  I love supporting local, family-owned small businesses, and this one really deserves the patronage.  Love it."}
{"text":"Tasty pizza!   The thin crust has a flavorful sauce with just enough cheese.  The crust is actually crusty and not soggy.  Polite and clean...will definitely return when in Nevada!  Oh, and they have ice cream...Thrifty ice cream!  The server put ice cream in my cone, and then the scoop on top.  That's a must for any true ice cream lover!  But just a heads up, this place is not conducive to large parties."}
{"text":"What? Thrifty Ice Cream shop and now they serve pizza? Hell no, that's what our family contemplated until we had to give it a try to taste then out.  We ordered two garlic breads and a deep Chicago pep pizza and wow was it on point. We were driving almost dirty minutes for a Chicago Pep pizza before and were we idiots. This place is the spot, I also ordered a pint of mint and rocky road ice cream; also on point.  Service was great, and the establishment was very clean. Will from now on come and order pizza from here."}
{"text":"The owner Rick is real and honest. You can tell the family-owned business makes pizza from the heart and does not get caught up in the business besides making good NY-style pizza.   My company orders gere iften and my co-workers love it here too. A must try and we plan on coming here from now on."}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time as I am a Thirfty's Ice Cream kid and always drive or walk by this place and since no one in the house wanted to cook the other night figured we would all tried it since after all they do deliver Thrifty's Ice Cream by the pint or quart with their pizza.  I had one of their Stromboli's and WOW it was delicious to say the least, the crust itself was amazing and when I bit into the inside of the Stromboli it was even better!!!! Thumbs up from me all the way!!!!  As for my roommates they each had the stuffed pizza and was equally impressed and found that the pizza was so amazing that we will definitely be ordering from here again according to them!!!  And yes, I will be stopping by for Thrifty's Ice Cream on a regular basis :)"}
{"text":"First of all, the hamburgers are better than the pizzas, the service is crappy, and they only deliver when they are dead. Also, I'm pretty sure, that boxers and most athletes eat this type of food."}
{"text":"Never a bad experience, food is always on point friendly service quick delivery..  now they have the best ice cream"}
{"text":"I love this Cute family owned place. They have everything from pizza, sandwiches and calzones to salads, tacos and fish and chips! And the price is great."}
{"text":"Stopped in here cause it was close to our hotel... ordered a Phillip steak and pastrami, took it to our room to eat and were pleasantly surprised!! It was a very good sandwich, friendly service highly recommend. Only down side is the tv was kinda loud, that's why we got it to go."}
{"text":"Fancy digs it is not but we care about great pizza and that they have. In addition they make killer sandwiches, fantastic wings and yummy desserts.  The price is right but always ask if they have a special running. For a treat order a cookie which they bake to order. Oh heck yeah!"}
