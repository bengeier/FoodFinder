{"text":"40 minutes after I ordered, the delivery guy called to ask me what my address was. Another 20 minutes passed. I called him back to ask when he'd be at my house. He said maybe 15 minutes? He asked when I'd ordered-- I told him an hour ago. He told me the receipt said I'd only ordered 30 mins ago. He also told me he had a lot of other orders to deliver. Okay.  20 more minutes passed. The food arrives, the delivery boy doesn't say a word to me but gives me the box and walks away. I open the box-- the pizza is covered in saran wrap??? Upon closer inspection the mushroom and onion toppings I ordered appear to be completely raw. They just threw 'em on top of the pizza, I guess.   I held out hope that the food would still be good-- but it wasn't. Will never, ever, ever order from here again. Ever."}
{"text":"The worst pizza I have ever had in Pittsburgh. Delivery was on time but I ended up heating up leftovers as it was basically inedible."}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews, but I HAD to for this place. I had no issues with delivery, but I was served wings that looked & tasted as if they had been cooked years ago! The only thing that kept me from giving them 1 star was the fact that the chili that I ordered had a pretty good taste to it, but I had to throw almost all of my 12 wings away.. What a waste!  I'm not necessarily trying to keep people from eating here because I definitely haven't tried everything, but hopefully this can be a heads up for certain items."}
{"text":"Larry & Carol Pizza Just had a rude yelling from your delivery man just now  He was mad because he couldn't find my college campus and took it out on the  customer. I came outside to get a pizza he gave me from his car. Unprofessional!   Please give GPS to your employees and teach them kindness to the customers.    I am a college student at Point Park University from Seattle I put down the address the school gave me    I will never order anything from you again! I warn others not to go through this over some pizza."}
{"text":"I used to look forward to getting wedgies from here.  It used to be on my must get list anytime I was in Pitts.  In any case, we ended up ordering 2 steak wedgies to go over the phone.  We get there and they had made the wrong items and gave us hoagies instead.  Had we not been in a time crunch, it wouldn't have bothered me but really, don't make it seem like it's our fault!  It was good, but not as great as I had once imagined.  Basically a wedgie is similar to a calzone but think of it as a sandwich enclosed in pizza dough and then you eat it with italian dressing.  Pretty much a pick up and go type of joint, no tables inside."}
{"text":"The manager Kevin is always so great!! The hoagies are so yummy! I always get the buffalo chicken with ranch. Their pizza is perfect, you can't go wrong with cheese and mushroom! It's an Oakland favorite. Thank god they have been here my whole college career!"}
{"text":"Usually their pizza is great and delivery is quick.  Unfortunately lately service has declined rapidly. Our last pizza came with most of the cheese and toppings slid off one side into the corner of the box. tonight, it is 8:00 pm, we ordered our pizza at 5:30, and when we called to ask where our pizza was we were told they \"Dont give a damn about our order.\" we are getting a full refund from GrubHub. What a failure, Larry and Carol's; you used to be really good."}
{"text":"Once again the food took way longer than promised and this time it was cold ... only live three minutes away! NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"This was wonderful pizza, definitely some of the best I've had in Pittsburgh. Delivery arrived well before timeframe given."}
{"text":"I had a very poor experience Saturday night. First, the pizza delivered was not what I ordered. Second, the pizza was basically inedible...like mostly dough...disgusting. Also, when ordering from an app I know I tip in advance so there is no incentive for the driver to go above and beyond, but get out of the car at least."}
{"text":"When I was in college at CMU, Larry & Carol's was a main part of my diet. In addition to having 5 phone lines (so you could always get through), they were open till 3am doing brisk delivery business on campus with their delicious toasted sandwiches and pizza.    These days when I'm back in da 'Burgh to visit the parental units, I always stop off at Larry & Carols and pickup a footlong sandwich for old time's sake!"}
{"text":"It had been awhile since I had Larry & Carol's pizza. In fact, the last time I ordered their pizza was when I was an undergrad and we got the King Kong, which was a 36\" pizza at the time. Now, it's apparently bigger. Anyway, I recently ordered a small pizza for delivery and it took about an hour to arrive. Why so long I'm not sure. But the pizza was good and it was a nice change from chain pizza."}
{"text":"This place is a disappointment. It took 2 hours to get my pizza, when they told me 45 minutes to an hour. I was told the first time the driver was leaving in 2 minutes, and I was his only stop. It took another 50 minutes to get to my house. I live about 10 minutes away. When it finally got to my house after three calls and two hours, it was cold. When I put it in the microwave, it wasn't even good warm pizza. The Pizza was okay at best, just not worth a 2 hour wait. I will avoid this place going forward. Pizza Sola is way better!"}
{"text":"When my family comes to visit or when we drive home for a visit we always have Larry & Carol's cheese steak wedgies either waiting for them or at least 6 of them boxed up for the drive.  It's expected and devoured immediately.  We've been doing this for over 20 years and everyone would be sad if we didn't.   Cheese steak wedgies with extra cheese and add banana peppers is the way to go.  Italian dressing comes on the side.  Wedgies are like a pizza that they flipped half over and didn't seal so you can get in there and add the dressing (and anything else you want).  It's delicious and travels really well. :-)  I can't comment on anything else because, honestly, this is the only thing we ever get here."}
{"text":"Wow! I will never order from here again!!! The only reason they got 1 star is because the food is good, but i ordered a hoagie last week it was cold, sauggy, and dry! & i called to let them know and a guy named keith told me that he was sorry for that and to ask for him next time. Well here it is next time and i talked to keith about 4:30pm today and he told me to call about 6:00pm cause they had a King Kong order i said ok i called back at 6:30 and ask for keith and the guy said keith isn't working today call back tomorrow! He blatantly lied and was very rude!! Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"this place is great! they are so nice! good food! great service! even if you are a little drunk everyone is kind if you are kind to them too! awesome!!!!"}
{"text":"Let me add to the horrible reviews this place seems to amass.  Bad customer service, bad menu, and worst of all, bland tasting food.  I have heard many people say to steer clear of this place and I have done so until recently.  My coworkers were ordering food and since I was without I decided to order with them as well.  I mean, what else can you do when you are kind of stuck and hungry.  Once I read over the menu I opted for an item.  I am not a total grammar nazi, but I do get a little irked when a grammatical error messes with the food I order.  The item I ordered off their menu (a menu that they sent to the printer and then handed out to their customers) is listed as follows:  \"Italian, Sausage, Meatball, Roni.\"  Now, if you are like me, seeing the comma, you assume that all that is included in the Calzone.  I thought awesome, basically a meat lovers calzone.  When the order went in I got a meatball calzone.    Upon inquiry of why this was so they told me that it was only one meat in this calzone.  So the question that instantly came to my head is why list them all on one line.  If you have no meat lover style calzone, make sure your menu doesn't make the customer think that.  If you have a Italian, sausage, meatball, and roni calzone separately; list it that way.  Everything else is listed separately on the menu, it obviously isn't that hard to do.  As for the taste of the food, I have definitely had better.  Nothing to write home about there.  In fact the food tasted kind of dry.  Not sure how you can make cheese taste dry, but they were able to do so here."}
{"text":"I've tried the pizza and the calzones. The pizza is weird, and incredibly greasy. The tomato sauce is too sweet. The cheese is seperated from the sauce and greasy.  The calzones are ok, it's mostly the same ingredients, but the dough was a little bit better and the grease didn't seem to explode out of the thing as much."}
{"text":"As a Pitt student this is the best place to get pizza in the entire extended campus of Pitt. Not only is this place efficient and authentic it is desirable by all Pitt students. L&C is desirable by not only underclassmen but upperclassmen as well.   You can get slices as well. 100% best place for pizza in OAKLAND!!"}
{"text":"30 inches. Of pizza. For 30 dollars. YEET. If you like pizza, why would you not give this place your time of day? The quality of the Larry and Carols' pizza would probably hit a 5-6/10 if you ask me. It's a satisfying, yummy pie with good distribution of sauce, cheese and crust. So while the pizza is just average, the fact that the menu offers a \"King Kong\" 30 inch pizza option should be enough to satisfy any pizza lover's passion. The King Kong is a great option for game days, campus events or just some 'ol American gluttony.  I never did the King Kong Pizza Challenge in store, but my buddies and I tried to eat one in a hour by ourselves in an, it didn't go well. I've attached the photos for your sadistic entertainment.  Also, King Kong is a dope movie. 1933 was a weird year and that movie really helped turn things around and establish legitimacy in American sci-fi/disaster movie making, so thanks for doing cinema some justice, Larry and Carols."}
{"text":"originally we came to Oakland late night for mad mex. They had a wait and we were starving. it was close to midnight. we parked by larry and carols and decided to just eat here.   We each ordered a slice of pepperoni. Slice was huge and they were generous with pepperoni. I would say that it was lacking flavor In the sauce. It was pretty basic. But I love NY style pizza and this wasn't bad for a midnight slice.   we also ordered chocolate PB cheesecake. not bad.   probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but it did its job for us Saturday night."}
{"text":"This was good pizza! Thin crust, ingredients were cut in medium size pieces not too big not too little."}
{"text":"I love ordering from here but they almost never arrive on time. I live on campus and I understand it can get confusing but sometimes, they call almost 20 minutes after they should already be here and ask for directions. Great food...taste homemade and authentic. Maybe I'll have to start ordering in store."}
{"text":"Ordered the Mediterranean chicken salad (around $11.50) from Grubhub and was not impressed. The lettuce pieces and cucumber pieces were way too big to fit in your mouth without cutting them. Also, according to the grubhub menu there would be roasted red peppers but instead there were raw green bell peppers. The size was big enough for an entire meal.   I definitely would not come back for another salad, but would be open to trying their pizza!"}
{"text":"Not bad.  It's basic pizza, folks.  Just what I wanted.  Can't do the heavy toppings.  This was perfect. 3 stars for the food.  1 extra star because I got my order in a half an hour and the price with tip was under 20 bucks.  That's a winner in my book.  They have a big menu to choose from, so I will try them again soon."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review so that others might avoid the horror that is Larry & Carol's.  The two virtues of Larry & Carols is that they are open until really late, and the food is fairly cheap. On the other hand, the food is average at best, and downright terrible at worst. Everything is overly greasy, and their pizza and calzones could charitably be called 'unique.' They often leave out items when delivering, and take a pretty long time to do so.  All in all, probably the worst option for late night food. I would highly recommend finding somewhere else. On the other hand, they avoid getting a single star because they are open later than any delivery joint other than Domino's and Vocelli's, and because nothing there has made me physically ill."}
{"text":"When I was in Pittsburgh back in March we ordered the King Kong pizza from here on St Patrick's day to feed like 10 people. This pizza was HUGE! It was so very tasty and not too greasy (which is important to me). If I recall correctly, we just ordered a pepperoni pizza. I'm not a huge pepperoni fan but it was still good. The dough, sauce and cheese were very tasty. It was devoured quickly!"}
{"text":"Two mix ups on my delivered order. After waiting an hour and a half , I was called and told that I would have to wait another hour if i wanted my food. Not much was done to right the wrong. Will never order from them again."}
{"text":"Defiantly one of my favorite pizza places I've tried so far while being in the shadyside area. The crust was cooked to perfection, perfect amount of sauce on the pizza and the cheese was glorious! I loved it!"}
{"text":"Let's start off by saying that this place has horrible service and I was  cursed at twice by the delivery drivers in two separate orders.  So I placed an order with them online for two deluxe calzones and it arrived 45 minutes late. Understandably, the restaurant can be short-staffed on a Sunday night but not only was the delivery late, the delivery man addressed me very rudely and cursed me out. This was inexcusable behavior and bore a bad name for the restaurant. I called the restaurant's night manager who gave me nothing more than a snappy apology.  The calzones themselves were decently sized and filled with good oily ingredients but the crust was too thick for my liking.  I will remember to not tip the driver beforehand next time, IF I will even consider ordering from such an establishment.  *Update* I gave them another try a year later and when I undertipped the driver (~10% on a $7 delivery) he later sent me a very rude text message calling me an \"ignorant a**\" and finished it off with \"don't order food anymore a**hole\"  Ok, I'll take your advice. You just lost my business and everyone in my apartment after I told them this story."}
{"text":"I shared the King Kong pizza with a lot of friends. The quality of the pizza is on par with the other pizza joints south of Forbes in Oakland; however, the allure was clearly ordering a monstrous pizza.  As a note, Larry & Carol's is open late."}
{"text":"In lieu of the recent events that provide a haunting admonition to the fate of Larry and Carol's, I'd like to add my review.  Here's to the late nights on Semple street, having too good of a time to stumble the fifteen feet across the street to our door; here's to the muscle outside Larry and Carol's until 4 AM, the muscle that came back a few hours later, the muscle that kept a pretty dirty watch on the block. Here's to the always-tired staff, the cooks that wouldn't hesitate to ask you what the hell you wanted in their store, the cooks that gave up dough for the locals. Here's to the pizza, that horrible pizza; and here's to the rest of the food that we were too wasted to ever want to try, because it was always about the pizza. Here's to the King Kong, and here's to the parties, and here's to the memories of Larry and Carol's.  They weren't the best place, they weren't the nicest place, but they were quite the place.  L&C, L&C, L&C forever."}
{"text":"A friend of mine wrote a song with the lyrics; \"It may look the same, it may have the same name, but it's not the same place.\"  Such is the case of Larry and Carols since they are now, from what I understand under new ownership.  This review is for the old Larry and Carol's under the previous owners. So the star rating is not to be seen as that accurate.  Back when I lived in Souf oakland this was my favorite pizza place from 1994-1999/2000. They use to have this pizza on the menu called the pizza duo.  It was the most amazing pizza I had ever had.  It was a pizza on top of a pizza.  A co-worker of mine was the cousin of the then manager?  He passed and the duo passed with him.  After his passing the duo was never cooked in the center properly.  I see that it is no longer on the new owners menu. So sad since this was such a great invention. I turned many friends, including culinary students on to L&C. Their duo and specialty pizzas were the best and impressed my chef friends. After 99-2000 and the passing of the cousin we started going to Say Cheese. The question remains since the menu and the hours of operation have changed so much (no longer open till 3-4 A.M.) should they really be allowed to keep this historic name the same? In my opinion no.  This is not the Larry and Carols of yesteryear. Those years you shlepped (and sometimes friends even rollerbladed) through the dark alleyways of souf Oakland in the wee hours of the night to get an amazing creation are long gone. The memory and my copy of the old paper menu will live forever.  As for the new owners I wish them good luck in their business."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!  The service is terrible!  I tried ordering from allmenus.com (which is fantastic).  Before I try a new place, I always look at their info FIRST to make sure I'm in their delivery range and check the delivery cost.  This included ALL of the triangle in their range and said no delivery fee.  I placed an order, with the delivery time in 45-60 minutes.    OVER an hour later, allmenus called to tell me that the restaurant had called them, cancelled my order, and said I was out of their delivery range.  I told the rep that that was not the case on their website, and he said he could only tell me what the restaurant said.  I should have been EATING by now, and now I had absolutely nothing coming.  I called the restaurant and asked for the manager.  I explained what had happened and he said that they won't deliver downtown.  I told him that if that's the case, they need to inform the website of it so that people like me don't get screwed over later.  Instead of asking me to hold on, he just started talking to other people in the restaurant asking if they had called.  Well of course they had - or I wouldn't have called him - I was talking about calling them for something else!  I repeated myself, and then told him that waiting over an HOUR to inform me of the problem was completely unprofessional, and he told me that if I was going to criticize him then he would cancel his account.  HAHAHA what account?  His listing on allmenus? Go ahead, buddy, I don't own that website, you only lost a customer, and any other potential customer who knows me or reads the reviews online about them.   Unbelievable.  PLEASE do not give these people your money - it is better spent elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've recalled my memory of having some good pizza from Larry and Carol's and looked forward for another good one but my expectation has been completely shattered. I thought I've placed order at different restaurant but it sure was Larry and Carol."}
{"text":"Not a whole lot to say since I ordered delivery but the white pizza with black olives was delicious.   Delivery was prompt had to go out to the car the guy didn't get out which was kind of odd and unprofessional but not a big deal.  All in all I wasn't disappointed but it's pizza it's always pretty good"}
{"text":"$1.75 slices all day everyday. Not Antoons or Sorrentos size. Actual slices  The best slice you'll get in Oakland.  Not the best pizza ever, but if you're looking for something other than a $5 pizza after a night of drinking, Larry and Carol's is a great option.  Newly renovated and now there's a lot more space.    Only minuses of L&C are the street isn't the cleanest and can get creepy after dark and the staff can sometimes clutter the place and make patrons feel very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Good food until they are busy, then it becomes very sub par. Thursday, Friday, or Saturday are terrible, I've been waiting over an hour"}
{"text":"I've had this pizza twice delivered and it's fairly basic. I don't think it's that amazing but it gets the job done as basic pizza.   Back when I was a meat eater, I had their chicken & broccoli and that was pretty good. Recently, I had their veggie with cheese and that was tasty too. But there's nothing very special about it. The cheese is very heavy and the crust isn't anything to write home about it.   I'm sure this stuff is amazing as drunk or hangover food but it's not like a culinary masterpiece."}
{"text":"I ordered a cheesesteak sandwich tonight with provolone and onions on it; the sandwich only had chicken, no cheese or onions. The first and last time I will order from here."}
