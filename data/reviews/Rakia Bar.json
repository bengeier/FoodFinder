{"text":"As a former employee of hrvati bar, I'm really glad to see this place improve. Serbian service and chef really make the experience feel like home. I love the mint in the flowers and all the cute little glasses for the rakijas.

My best friend and I ordered everything from the menu and tried every rakija on the list while listening to vaya con Dias. Our server was very informative and treated us to dessert in the end.

Well done DuÂšan"}
{"text":"What a treat on a  Monday night - fabulous food, service, music and rakia!

This was my first time trying Rakia Bar and its famous Serbian drink. So worth the trip!

The food was fantastic; portions and flavour abound - and the service was stellar.

Live jazz was a great touch and half price main menu made for a great evening.

Go check this place out as soon as you can."}
{"text":"Rakia Bar is a pleasant addition to the up and coming nabe.  Dark, sexy ambiance.  I haven't eaten there yet, only went for bevvies after dinner a few times.  The staff know their drinks.  Very welcoming. Check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  Huge portions for very reasonable prices, a varied drink list, and a cozy, intimate atmosphere--perfect for huddling up on a rainy night!  Apparently the food is made at their other location and transported to this one--not sure if that will change as this place gets up and running, but it does mean that they can run out of the more popular menu items.  We had to settle for a small portion of the cevapi since they didn't have enough for a large order (and even though we ordered a ton of food, I would have made room for it--it was absolutely delicious, well seasoned and perfectly juicy.)"}
{"text":"I understand that the restaurant is taking a different direction and representing itself as a contemporary eastern European cuisine serving restaurant, not advertising itself as a \"serbian\" restaurant, however. Traditional Serbian dish names need not be labeled against new contemporary dish experiences made by a non-Serbian chef. It is deceiving to introduce \"chevapi\" as a dish to a Canadian clientele having not tried the real \"Balkan style\" chevaps.

Restaurant with good services, good food, and good atmosphere may qualify for why a customer may choose to give a percentage of their choice to the calculated restaurant bill. Charging 18% gratuity on top of a 3 persons' bill does not represent current restaurant industry practices on gratuity fees.  It is with a customer's consent that any gratuity be paid. In Canada, a customer needs to be warned prior the food being served about the \"mandatory\" gratuity if any as well as prior to paying the bill.  

The restaurant will be remembered by its lounge atmosphere, bland food, and poor customer appreciation. 

I agree with the customer above... Rakia has been diluted from what it is back in Serbia, I guess the whole concept is diluted...trying to adhere to 'contemporary' feel and staying away from its true Balkan roots. I would say wrong call to the entire concept. Someone once said, its called tradition because the practice/food has survived through centuries.

PRO: Servers are warm and welcoming. There is still time to improve the quality of food;)"}
{"text":"If this place is around in a month I'll be surprised.

Went here for breakfast and although it looks nice and the menu seems ok, the service was unbelievably slow and the food was really terrible.

I repeat, do not go here for brunch.  You will be disappointed."}
{"text":"We came out for a friend's birthday on a slow Sunday night-- thanks Hurricane Sandy, you probably kept the crowds away!

I don't usually venture out to the east end, but I'll be bringing a few friends back for food and rakia. Our group had a great time sharing two flights of eight different rakia, split between 5 of us. Splitting a flight with friends gives you the opportunity to try a bunch of different things at your own pace without committing to the alcohol load -- rakia is normally 40-45% ABV so you don't want to be put square on your ass after a couple of shots. I didn't mind the price range; rakia may be ho-hum at home in Serbia and Croatia, but for Canada this is specialty liqueur. We are never going to get European prices on alcohol here and I'm resigned to that. Besides, the flights only set us back about $12 each, for about 1.5oz of alcohol. I've been to places that will charge you an obscene $7 for an ounce of Sauza, for cryin' out loud! Now *that* is a ripoff, even if they throw in the obligatory lemon wedge.

I don't have much experience with fruit-based alcohols-- the closest I've come is having home-made quince and pear kirschwasser from the Alsace province in France. That stuff nearly seared my face off my skull. The rakia at Rakia Bar were much smoother. The plum brandies infused with honey and thyme or honey and mint were particularly delightful. We don't really come across quince here in Canada so it was a cool surprise to find it, since it's a great fruit and makes a particularly fragrant liqueur. Again, I guess I'm repeating myself: try a flight with friends. It really gets you access to a broad palette of flavours. If you fall in love with a particular flavour, you can always set off on your own at that point.

I enjoyed the food; the cabbage roll could have used a bit more spice but it sat on some lovely mashed potatoes and was simmered with side ribs (hello! you guys obviously got my number here). My partner's burger, bun or not, was pretty middling. The charcuterie plate was fun to share. Another friend ordered the hunter's stew because he wanted another appetizer and for $12 we were shocked-- it was definitely meal-sized. Our server, who was also one of the dudes in charge, was flexible about addressing food complexities (gluten-free/vegetarian). And he had a jaunty moustache to boot.

Happy birthday to our friend (and thanks to the next table for chiming in to sing to him)!, and we hope to be back soon."}
{"text":"This a wonderful example of the kind of fusion foods that are flourishing in Toronto. The restaurant features rakia, a Serbian eau de vie or fruit tree liqueur, and the foods that go well with it -- with a bent toward Serbian, but not necessarily. There's Serbian style pork but the hot paprika is missing. This is one of the few places that shows Serbian food is part of a sophisticated cuisine, and helps build the city's rep as a place where the whole world comes to eat -- intercultural, not just multicultural."}
{"text":"TL;DR the entire experience was disappointing. 

We went here a few months ago when the place was still known as Hrvati. It was nothing to write home about then, so I think my decision to go to Rakia last night was more wishful thinking. Maybe it had changed! 

Wrong. 

We had to seat ourselves, the waitress never approached, just kinda stared at us. I informed her one more person would be coming, so three in total. I quickly made a trip to the dingy loo before sitting down on the uncomfortable bench seat. The food and drink menu *look* impressive. I did not want an alcoholic drink, so I asked for an iced tea - which they were out of. We pondered for a while and decided on a burger, the schnitzel and the beef stew. My boyfriend asked for a cocktail from the happy hour menu. They were out of that too. He tried picking a beer, and they were out of that particular beer as well (on a Thursday night!) My sister asked for an entirely plain burger - only meat and lettuce, some condiments on the side. They were out of lettuce. And the server had to make sure they weren't out of mustard as well. 

The food arrived. I can't complain about the tastiness of my schnitzel. It wasn't bad. The burger seemed to be cooked in the \"proper\" Balkan style, too. But the stew was bland and basically non-existent (pretty much a portion for ants.) 

Atmosphere-wise, the place is cozy and personal. The picnic table idea is getting old and some more \"proper\" seating would have been nice. They blasted annoying music the entire time. 

Our bill took a long time to arrive and getting change (so I could leave a proper tip) was like pulling teeth. They were out of change. The server had to dig through her wallet to scrounge up the right amount.  

The Rakia in Leslieville seems nicer overall. 

Save yourself some time and go to a tasty Korean place in the area if you happen to be there. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday celebration after loading up on good pizza spot upstairs. The place was somewhat packed and has a laid back cool vibe. We got lucky as a group of people were leaving and we were able to snag a larger table.
This place's claim to fame is the Rakia (a popular alcoholic beverage in Southeast Europe produced by distillation of fermented fruit according to WiKi) I haven't had this liquor before but have tried similar stuff from Turkey and Lebanon.  It is best enjoyed with some food from what I was told unfortunately we were all so full that couldn't order food and just stuck to drinks. Beer selection is OK and wine list seemed decent. The prices are quite reasonable so one can go overboard. I tried the pear and plum flavored rakia (not my cup of tea) but if you like that sort of alcohol I would say give it a shot (pun intended) 
Then they started playing LIVE traditional style music. Needless to say the party was elevated to a whole another level with the birthday girl sashaying all over, and several of us joining in the action, fun times. The service was good and we did enjoy the cozy vibe this place offers. We ended up closing the bar as this outing lasted till the wee hours of the morning always a good sign. 
A nice place to visit if you are hell bent on painting the town red."}
{"text":"This place is cool. Something a bit unexpected, that you wouldn't expect to find in Korea town.

The place has a unique vibe to it sort of European/rustic feel. The tables had cute vases with fresh flowers in them. The place is small with picnic tables running through the middle, some side tables, and the bar area. 

The bar tender was friendly and willing to go over the different drinks and make suggestions about both the food and drinks. 

We got here around 7pm right before the crowd got there. Which was nice as we managed to grabbed some seats at the picnic table. The bar specializes in rakia -  distilled spirits. The drinks are very strong. More of a sipping drink. The don't have all the varieties listed here, but they have a good selection.

This was my first time trying Rakia and Balkan food. Not sure how close the original Balkan food it is, but I enjoyed it. We got different dishes to share. We ordered the Chevapi platter that comes with beef and pork meat, roaster pepper spread, kaymak (type of cheese) reminded me of a creamier, but lighter cream cheese. It also came with this yummy bread, which reminded me of naan. We also got the Black George Schnitzel, which comes with kaymak, spatzle, and a sausage. I really enjoyed the Leek Potato Croquettes, which were delicious. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Although it had leeks it wasn't an overpowering flavour in the croquette. The Chevapi and the croquette were my favourite dishes of the night.

I liked this bar, it was a cool place to grab a bit to eat and a drink. I'll be back to try some of their other dishes and another type of rakia."}
{"text":"I've been here on two occasions and loved it both times.
My first was when I photographed a wedding that was featured its dinner at Rakia bar. The food and drink were great. The service was impeccable. Everyone had an amazing time.
I was also here on my anniversary date. We had two courses of food and drink. We went on a Sunday night, so the place was very intimate. The service, again, was top not, and our waitress was very knowledgeable. Being a vegetarian, I was pleasantly surprised at their variety and flexibility. 
The rakia was delicious. A reviewer below commented that rakia is traditionally considered a low-end spirit; he likened it to bathtub moonshine which is here served at champagne prices. This is not a fair point, for one always has to consider the scarcity of the product in Canada and our perception of its uniqueness and flavour."}
{"text":"I booked this cozy resto/bar for my birthday and first off, they were great - friendly and accommodating.  I was sent a couple of menus based on my budget that included a suckling pig.  For a large group of 18 they didn't request a credit card deposit, nor did they impose an 18% tip on the bill as some restaurants do.  They let me bring in my own cake, and provided candles when I forgot to bring them.  Service was great, the food came out at reasonable times based on when everyone was settled.  My only minor note was that they ran out of the apps for the prix fix menu when four of my friends arrived - but they were late, my friend's fault - so I had to pay a bit extra to make sure they had appetizers.  Other than that, we had a great time, taking over the large wooden dining table in the middle of the restaurant and had a leisurely 3 hour dinner.
Now on to the food:
Rakia is interesting and definitely an acquired taste. Some of the rakia has nice fruity undertones, some taste more like rubbing alcohol, but an interesting experience nonetheless. The rakia menu is extensive, so it's fun to try with all your friends.
This was our dinner menu, served family style:
APPETIZER
~ Bread Basket -lepinya, cheese rolls and corn bread with three
traditional spreads
~ Mezze - sliced meats ~ aged cheese ~ feta cheese ~ house pickled vegetables ~
~ Truffle polenta parmesan fries
SALADS
~ Traditional Balkan \"Sopska\" Salad
MAIN
Meat Platter with Suckling Pig
Black George snitzel ~ chevapi ~ Viennese schnitzel ~
~ beans ~ slaw ~ bakers potatoes ~
~ Suckling Pig

The polenta parmesan fries are just as delicious as they sound!  All the spreads and pickled items were yummy as well.  The salad wasn't anything too special, a tomato and cucumber salad with cheese - but I guess that's the tradition and well, it was a good tomato and cucumber salad!  The meat plate was satisfying.  The chevapi was really tasty kebab.  The suckling pig wasn't hot when it was served, I'm not sure if it's supposed to be served like that or because it was carved much earlier, but we were surprised by this.  That said, it still tasted amazing, crispy skin and all!

In the end, everyone had a great time, the price was reasonable and everyone was full (there were leftovers)

Thanks to Sabina for taking care of us!"}
{"text":"We went here for a birthday celebration with a big group. Great food and great atmosphere and service! Loved the placed. But we ended up paying twice for drinks and a meal which put a damper near the end of the night. I understand there was a big group but they need a better system for paying and keeping track of the tabs."}
{"text":"Rakia Bar is simply a whole lot of fun! 

I came here for a Birthday celebration on a Saturday night recently. Rakia is a Serbian restaurant that now has 2 Toronto locations (In addition to a couple in Serbia). It is named after a Serbian spirit similar to brandy so it should be no surprise that their drink selection has a good variety of their namesake drink. 

The food at Rakia was quite good which is no surprise as the kitchen seems to be manned by Serbian grandmothers. I had the cabbage rolls served over mash potatoes, a smoked pork rib and house made sauerkraut. Good sour elements on the dish; the smoked pork rib was interesting and almost had a jerky like texture. All in all this was a satisfying dish. I also got to try the stuffed red pepper (stuffed with orzo) and served with a side of potatoes. The orzo was ok if not a bit bland but the potatoes were fried magical pieces of goodness. I also managed to snag a bite of someone's Chevapi (Serbian sausage plate), these little sausages were so delicious, juicy and well spiced. For dessert we shared a Rakia brownie which was very moist and quite decadent. 

The bar itself is awesome, very laid back and intimate atmosphere. On this night there was a live band making its way around the place serenading us with a mix of Serbian and Italian songs. The band and the atmosphere definitely gives this place an old world charm. The service was quite good and the food for our large table came out rather quickly. They have an extensive drink list that includes a nice selection of European beers which ensured I was a happy man! The prices for food and drink are extremely reasonable (all dishes under $20). 

Rakia is a great place to drink for a night if you just was to have a chill, laid back yet extremely fun evening with friends. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Sadly, this is not the awesome you're looking for.

Rakia is the stock \"everyone drinks it\" Serbian booze - fruit brandy, basically - and this place does have several varieties on offer. If you've never had it and it sounds like your bag, pop in and they'll sell you some.

But they'll charge you too much for it. $8-15 a drink for what is culturally, in Serbia, somewhere between bathtub moonshine and table wine. You're outta luck if you want to stray to more familiar ground, too, as their beer selection is anemic - I didn't get a chance to check their wines.

To soak up your booze, they have a menu of plates from the tiny to the big and shareable, and the menu descriptions sound lovely. Table bread with paprika pork drippings instead of butter. A Serbian sausage plate with venison, wild boar, and lamb. And, at market price ($28 in our case), a suckling pig platter. Where the description soar, the delivery is weak. The sausages are difficult to discern from one another, with seasoning drowning out the meats. The suckling pig was really greasy and over-breaded; we didn't finish it, though only partly because of the preparation.

The real reason we ran out of the place was that around 8pm on a Thursday the live music started, amplified through the smallish space, and made conversation impossible. Our server was nice, and nudged the volume down when we asked, but it's clear they were going for a loud and happening feel and it really just missed us completely. We settled up and sprinted down the street to The Comrade for cocktails and kimchi rice.

I like the idea behind a Serbian bar in Leslieville. I want this place to get better, and might give it another shot in a few months once they've settled in. But the food doesn't justify the prices, nor does the cachet of a far-away moonshine culture.

Pro-tip: the servers are quite nice, and happy to make recommendations. If you're gonna go here against my warnings, at least help them help you."}
{"text":"My sister and I celebrated our birthday last Saturday night. I appreciated that they were able to accommodate our group since we were 17 in total. The restaurant was warm and cozy. The servers were very welcoming and helpful with all our questions about the menu and the rakia.

Drinks: Plum rakia (The interpreter)
            Apricot rakia (The king's Toast)
            My sister and I found the rakia very 
            strong. We enjoyed their cocktails       
            More like the Blondinsky made with
            Strawberry grappa, limoncello and 
            Prosecco.

Food: Mezze platter for 2
          Loved the variety.
          Leek potato croquettes
          Not what I expected, it was ok but a 
          Little to greasy.
          Chevapi
          This was my absolute favorite. The 
          Order came with 10 mini ground beef/
          Pork kebobs, buttered bread, diced 
          Onions, red pepper spread and a 
          Cheese like spread.

Pros: great atmosphere with live band
         Friendly and helpful servers, during 
         Service never felt rushed
         Good hearty food and strong booze
         Since we were celebrating 2 birthdays, 
         We were allowed to bring 2 cakes at 
         No additional cost.

Cons: when reconfirming our reservation, 
          We left 2 messages which were not 
          Returned. Our third attempt we were 
          Able to speak to someone directly
          They do not split bills, since we were 
          Such a large group, it was a hassle 
          Trying to figure out what each person 
          Owed

Verdict: I enjoyed my time at Rakia bar and 
             Would not hesitate to recommend 
             It to my friends."}
{"text":"Rakia recently took over this lcoation and it's a good addition. It's small, the music is kind of boring, the seating is brutal (Toronto, please bring this picnic bench thing to a stop) ... but the food and drink are the stars, which is fine by us.  There is a long list of beers and rakia - ask the servers, they are really happy to chat about choices.  And tthe food, YUM. A wee plate of pickles and peppers came out as a treat, nice touch. a generous cheese pie baked in filo was so greasy in all the right ways - it had a great creamy sauce with it. we also liked the crevari (or something, i forget) plate which had a giant supply of sausages, bread, dips, so hearty, it made a great doggy bag/ hangover brekkie the next morning.  Please salt your death stairs."}
{"text":"Came in here after a long walk from my auto repair place because I had a few hours to kill.  After walking past a bunch of really sketchy-looking (and closed) places that seemed like they'd be licensed, and even more places that were not licensed, I stumbled across this gem.
Had a sausage sandwich with onions and asked for it spicy - they did it up successfully. It came with some pickles for sweetness which was nice, but I didn't really care for the white bread toast as it was a little dry.. apparently it's good with an egg on it?"}
{"text":"A pretty cool new find.  Pretty neat brand new venue for Balkan food...it's primarily a Serbian take on things, but other regions are reflected.  

The FOOD: We shared a bunch of stuff among our group of 6.  The Black George Schnitzel was great Serbian comfort food....the Serbians in our group were impressed.  The Chevapi and Cabbage rolls were also solid.  It's generally fairly rustic and hearty, with a slight tendency to resort to frying as a cooking method.  Nonetheless, we generally liked all the flavors.  Prices on some items are a little high, but portion size was pretty good.

The DRINKS:  This bar specializes in Rakia...basically, it's Schnapps on steroids, often known as an Eau du Vie or Grappa.  These are high alcohol, generally fruit based, distillates.  Lots of options all served with cute glassware.  Some are a bit pricey.  They were also out of a lot of what we tried to order.  Beer selection doesn't offer much variety, so hopefully you like lagers or pilsners.

The SERVICE:  We had a friendly young Croatian woman.  She took good care of our group.

The ATMOSPHERE:  Also pretty rustic.  Big long communal table in the middle.  Not a lot of spots.

Definitely an interesting new addition, and a place to which I'll return."}
{"text":"I went with a group of three friends, and that was a mistake from the get-go. The place is TINY. So, if you're planning on going, definitely go with only one other person. We were lucky to be able to get a spot at all.

That being said, Rakia Bar's interior is splendid. Wooden panelling reminiscent of the Balkans with interesting posters on the walls (some look like they're from the 1930s). The space feels quite intimate, due to it's small size, and the tiny two-people nooks that are placed along the wall and at the window. I did not spend much time at the bar, but there is seating there too. Otherwise, there is a long wooden table in the centre of the bar, where you can fit a total of... 12-15 people? When we got there, there were already 10 people there, so it was just luck that helped us get a seat ultimately.

The rakia selection is quite good. Although, they had a whole bunch missing due to some problems with LCBO letting the booze go through the border (LCBO -- get your act together!!). I had an apricot one, and my friends tried a plumb one. They were both delicious. Mind you, they are delicious, but the quantity you get is...well, tiny. It's a shot. And it's $5.5 or more. 

If you want to try it for the novelty factor, or you are from the Balkans so you actually enjoy the drink, that's cool, but as a place you'd wanna go for drinks, not so much. (not sure how much regular drinks are, though). Their cocktails are relatively reasonably priced, but are very small...

I have not tried their food yet, but will most certainly do it the next time I go there!
Overall, a quite nice place, that has a lot of charm, despite it's tiny tiny size.
I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to try one of the strongest alcohols they'll ever try -- and they can even be deliciously flavoured: pear, apricot, peach (and there were others that I cannot recall right now).

Cheers!"}
{"text":"My first time here. It was a Saturday night and we almost didn't get a table as it was busy with what appeared to be Balkan and/or eastern European patrons (a good sign at a Balkan restaurant). The service was friendly and helpful. The rakia was smooth and delicious. The food was delicious and with generous servings. The establishment was clean. And there was live music to boot. I'll definitely return!"}
{"text":"WOO! Best new place I've been to in awhile.

Rakia Bar is in the old Hvarti location (I used to live in the area and no business seems to last more than a year, I remember it being various different Korean restaurants over the years as well). 

We came here on a rainy Wednesday evening. You have to suck it up regarding the seating - because it's not great. There is a giant picnic table style dining table in the center (probably can seat 20 people total, 10 on each side) and then several small high bar stool seating tables around the sides which just seat 2. The place is tiny overall.

Luckily for us, we were the only table of diners minus a few people at the back bar.

Between 3 of us we ordered 4 items - a mezze platter ($16), the gnocchi ($17), the Hungarian duo of schnitzel/sausage ($18) and a small serving oh Chevapi ($8). 

We barely managed to finish everything and our stomachs were slightly bursting. Probably a bit greedy of us.

The gnocchi was just okay (it was swimming in butter) but everything else was absolutely DELICIOUS and very well presented. The mezze plate and the schnitzel are absolutely must-trys.

The food came out quick and the server was lovely.

We did try one shot of rakia. It was quite disgusting to be honest, reminded me of Jack Daniels. Stick to the cocktails as they looked great and were well priced (most only $8)

Total bill was only $77 plus tip between the 3 of us, considering the quantity and quality of the food I thought it was really well priced.

Will go back again, would make a good date spot if you were seated at the high small 2 people tables, ambiance is dark and cozy. Communal table though not so hot if the restaurant is packed, I can see it being annoying, but we were lucky."}
{"text":"great wine, espresso, pizza and really cool view of the trains. i don't know how much longer the streetcar tracks will be there but it was definitely part of the charm in sitting upstairs. Loft- type high ceiling room. Love it.
Pizza is pretty much all you get here though. and don't bring gluten free friends lol no options for them really."}
{"text":"We went there for after dinner drinks & the owner & bar tender was amazing. Provided great service & you can definitely see the passion he has for Raika & his heritage.  Waitress was very pleasant & explained the menu well. Although it was not a hit with us...ambience is great, great service & want to go again to try dinner."}
