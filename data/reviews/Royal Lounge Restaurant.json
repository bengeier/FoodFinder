{"text":"horrible, gross, owners are some of the worst, down right rude people i've ever met, and the way he treats his employees in front of customers is appalling not to mention how he is towards his own customers. take a peek in the kitchen, yuck. i know someone that work\"ed\" there (past tense)  and got yelled at for not \"cutting around\" & serving old, outdated, moldy food. if you take your chances on the food, make sure you have penicillin!!!!!!! good luck.   btw, the 1 star is only to leave this comment."}
{"text":"The bottom line is this place is a dump. It is however a dump that has awesome wings.  If it were not for the wings, a one star rating would be overly generous."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the bad reviews are about, but I had a blast here when I came with some folks I had randomly met in the lobby of my hotel!  Appearance/Atmosphere: It's a dive bar, a real, live... dive bar. So what do you expect from a dive bar? Not much and that's the good part. There's random decorations all over the place, dart boards and even a cigarette machine. Lol. No tellin' where the last time I saw one of those was. There are 2 sides of the restaurant, the bar and the dining area. Obviously when I came there wasn't a soul over on the dining side. The bar is the centerpiece and there are stools that circle the entire thing, bartender right in the middle. There's also that Touch Tones thing where you can connect your phone to it and control the music!  Service: The bartender was our server, I can't remember her name, but apparently she's there ALL THE TIME so, you'll probably see her there when you go. Lol. She was friendly, personable, approachable and took really good care of all of us without missing a beat!  Food: Delicious. I was told to try their wings because they were the best around and they were close to right! I won't say THE best, but their dry rub was spicy, salty and full of flavor. Great wings. No sauce necessary. Funny thing is that there are random signs posted around the bar talking trash, \"If you need 20 choices of sauce, you don't like wings, you like sauce!\" Lol. There's so much truth to that statement.  Value: I can't remember exactly how much the wings were, but they were CHEAP. The WHOLE wing too, not just the drum or flat, you get both, attached. I bought 4 whole wings and was able to leave $6.00 to cover the tip and food. That's how cheap they were. I mean, how can you beat that?!  In conclusion... who needs fancy booths, modern decorations and the newest TVs hanging all over? I sure don't! Good, chill atmosphere with your buddies sipping tall boys and smashing wings. It doesn't get much better than that."}
