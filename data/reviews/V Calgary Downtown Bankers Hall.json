{"text":"I went on a saturday night and had a really good time. atmosphere is relaxed, laid back, inviting. the staff are friendly and quick. i also love the layout as the bar is easy to get to and the dance floor is spacious. Decor is modern and classy. One thing i didn't like is that their drinks are watered down. My friends and i ordered the long island iced tea and it tasted like juice and water (because there were so much ice)."}
{"text":"It's an alright place to go with friends for drinks and some dancing. I went on Saturday night and it was alright. I did not see a dancefloor and the place wasn't packed. Douche-factor is low on Saturday nights, but I did hear some dude puke all over the floor. Thankfully did not have to see the mess because staff took care of it fairly quickly. 

Apparently on Friday nights \"this place is poppin!\" according to my friend.

Drinks are WAY expensive though! Shots for $8? Woah."}
{"text":"This is a great venue if you're into hearing classic banging hip hop joints on the weekend. The lounge isn't too big at all but the perfect size to be hanging out with friends on a weekend, sipping in drinks and enjoying all the good looking people who seem to be working there. It does get very busy so sometimes it's a bit hectic to get drinks but I fi d that happens at any bar/club/lounge. Vbar as I call it is an excellent pre-destination before heading off to somewhere else as well. Again though, the hip hop here is bangin and that's reason enough to go."}
{"text":"We closed down the Starbucks next door in Banker's Hall on a Thursday night and the open door of this hopping lil spot caught our eye on the way out - OK, let's have a drink or 2! No one ever has to twist my arm! I had never even seen this place before.
We went in, there was a fairly large crowd but we got a really nice table for 2 towards the back. Good lighting, the music was decent and not too loud re conversation.
Service was quick and spot on. Friendly, energetic waitress.
Ordered were beers and vodka blueberry and sodas with lemon.
I was told this was a Vodka bar (hence the name V?) and that they have 60 different types at the bar for your selection pleasure!
The place is owned by Earl's but to me it had a less pretentious, more intimate vibe and we had a really good time! I did not see the bill so cannot comment on pricing. I am GUESSING it ain't cheap given location.
Cannot comment on the food either - next time."}
{"text":"I like V lounge, it's a small space that quickly draws in a large crowd throughout the night. Their bar area is convinient to fueling up on and jumping back onto the dance floor. Depending on whose spinning, the crowd can be largely...multicultural, meaning you best believe theres going to be some Filipinos up in this place! Yes, we gyrate our hips and put on our sour crooning faces when you put on some old school R&B.

I laid down my card to start a tab for my friend who came from T.O. and I'll tell you, keep count on those shots of Patron that you give away, you'll rack up your charges in no time. But it's all good, V- lounge is the place to celebrate when you want to reunite with childhood friends :)"}
{"text":"V Lounge is a decent spot on Stephen Ave for lunch or an after-work drink.  Same menu as Earls, but I think they will actually take reservations whereas Earls next door will not.  I've never been in the evening, have only passed by and it sounded like a great time!"}
{"text":"What a great venue!  The last time I was in this lounge, it was called Fuel.

I found myself in the V bar tonight after work for a friend's birthday and it was a fantastic time.

Our waitress was extremely funny and charismatic, and she was a big part of our experience.  She was not only extremely competetent, but friendly and witty.

I am watching my \"intake\", so i simply had a Field Salad, with cajun chicken on it.  The chicken was perfectly cooked and seasoned and the salad was.... good.  Actually it was delcious, but let's just say it was a necessary evil.  I would have much preferred the visually appealing dishes around me of some of my friends.  I watched with envy, my friend Mandy eat a fragrant delcious creamy curry soup.  When I couldn't take it any longer, I saw Kendra enjoying a chili chicken appetizer that also looked delightful.  However, I shouldn't feel too sorry for myself.  My salad was made with mixed greens, and had nuts, dried cranberries and a little bit of feta cheese on it.  If you have to have a healthy salad, this was the way to go.

The ambiance is very laid back and I was happy with the lighting.  The lights were down enough that we could chill out after a hard day of work.  However, it wasn't so dark that we couldn't see what we were eating.  Some lounges take the lights down too much, but not V!  I was still able to check out my food.

All in all, I wouldn't hesitate to arrange for a group to go here again.  This is a fantastic venue."}
{"text":"Our Group started out by stopping at Earl's next store for a weekday Dinner together. Since getting seated was going to be a bit of a wait, the Host suggested going over to \"V\" since it's the same menu, kitchen, and ownership as Earl's. We did so and got a nice big table by the window. That also helped mitigate the occasional \"thumpa thumpa thumpa\" of the background Lounge music. 

Since my last visit to Calgary a few years ago, the Calgary restaurant scene has seemed to take on a more 'fancy shmancy' persona. And on our Team expense account we certainly tried a few on previous nights. I've also been dining at various Earl's throughout Canada for years. What I like most in general is Earl's consistency in terms of quality food, good service, and it's friendly and casual atmosphere. I particularly like their Asian noodle/stir fry dishes and a certain dry BC Gewurztraminer that always seems to be on the menu when I stop by. 

I'm also consistent in that I tend to order the same things when I repeatedly visit a restaurant or cuisine that I like. Just ask Gayle about Chinese restaurants and Kung Pao Chicken. Why not stick with what you enjoy?  That's what I did at Earl's and with a work Team that was having a lot of fun together. So no matter where else I go within the Great White North and regardless of what trendy local chef is making bio-dynamic and sustainable waves, I know that I can always stop by and have a great meal and a good time at my friend Earl's place."}
{"text":"Service is very friendly. I asked for a Bellini and the waitress said they don't make them at V Bar, but that she'd get it at Earl's next door for me. It was awesome. I would definitely come back the next time I'm in Calgary."}
