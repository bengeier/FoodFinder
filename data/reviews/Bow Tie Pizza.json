{"text":"Visited friends in Calgary from Toronto and they recommended Bow Tie Pizza. They did not disappoint delicious Greek pan style pizza, will definitely hit them up again when I am back in the city."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing this pizza place for a few months now
Finally had a chance to pick up a pizza and wings last night
The pizza was amazing!
The toppings was fresh 
We are looking to try another pizza this week"}
{"text":"First off pizza is bangin. Loaded up with tons and tons of fresh ingredients, the dough is crispy of the outside and fluffy but yet doughy in the middle. Flavor is spot on, for the dough, toppings, sauce is amazing too. 8/10 The breadsticks are unreal 10/10.  This no normal breadstick!!! They just added pasta to their menu and the guys are knocking this out of the park as well. That meat sauce is cooked with love. Perfectly cooked noodles, crazy delicious sauce 9/10."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!   We needed a late lunch and found this place.... pizza was made very quickly and wildly exceeded the expectations of my wife, and my kids.  

Ordered a pepperoni for the kids and an all dressed up for the adults.   We ate at a friends place and honestly converted our friends.   

I'm coming back in July and will need to get some quick eats for my customers who are travelling with me.  Definitely calling these guys."}
{"text":"I've tried most of their pizza since they opened and it's by far the best pizza I've ever had in the city. I have to drive from the SW and it's worth the drive. The ingredients are always fresh and I love that they use real meat products and not processed ingredients. The sauce is unique which makes it better than any other pizza place. Customer service is top priority for this company and that makes me want to continue to support them. Great job, great food, great service!!!"}
{"text":"I found myself not getting pizza very often anymore because I was always getting let down. Then I got lucky trying out Bow Tie, it's the only pizza I'll ever order now. Top notch ingredients, crispy crust, delicious sauce and the bottom never gets soggy. I'm always left satisfied after a few slices and never feel backed up like I do after eating the big chain pies."}
{"text":"So we tried Bow-Tie lastnite. Picked-Up a \"Beard of Zeus \" & \"All Dressed Up\" Both were awesome. Flavor town!HAHAHAHA. The price was good. 2Ã—12inch for $36.00. This location has been dreadful in the past and it's nice to see the 2 guy's who are running it now are on point. It's our new go-to."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to bow tie pizza on Friday and it was an awesome place, every thing was clean and modern. We ordered the suit and tie pizza and it was delicious! Everything was made fresh and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The wait was short even though it was a busy Friday night. I would definitely eat here again! It's never a bad idea to support local businesses and I much prefer this pizza to any other chain restaurant. Can't wait to eat here again!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer - I received my food for free, as I was offered to try their product because I have a food blog. But this review is 100% honest. The vegan pizza is killer and I'm not a vegan or even a vegetarian. A fellow food blogger told me the vegan pizza was to die for so I had to try it. 
The pizza isn't a looker as the cheese is dairy-free. But the flavours of everything worked so well. I think its the vegan pesto that puts this pizza over the top. Vegetables are fresh and flavourful. The olives were good too and I usually hate olives in a pizza, but these were the real kalamata olives and not the canned type that some places use. 

A large pizza will feed three adults. I reheated the leftovers in the oven and it was even better than the night before!"}
{"text":"Fiercely feeling the pizza cravings laying on my couch one night, I decided to browse SkipTheDishes in search of a good classic pizza pie. I wasn't looking for thin-crust or Neapolitan style - those are always best eaten right out of that scorching oven they're made in - and I'm not much of a deep dish guy, so I just wanted a few slices of classic 'za while I glare at the tube.

Before I knew it, my driver had arrived and brought with him a gift from Bow Tie - a beautiful and massive 14\" meat pizza, half of which I later freezer bagged for the following week. The Meat Lovers came stacked with pepperoni, salami, ham and bacon, all on a thin layer of tomato sauce, and topped with a generous serving of melted mozzarella. To round out the deli meats, I added a few extra toppings - onions, mushrooms and green peppers; some of my favourites. The meats all tasted fresh as can be and it was evident that the veggies weren't soggy and old, but freshly cut, perhaps only hours before. As someone who doesn't enjoy eating plain crust, I made a mental note that the outsides of this pie were just as tasty as the insides. The crust had a softer crunch, something that only a quality dough will offer. The word \"stacked\" I mentioned earlier was no exaggeration - this pizza was massive and could have been mistaken for a deep dish at first glance. 

If you want real-deal - Seniore's and Vern's are the only joints in town that I believe have this place beat - do yourself a solid and get some delivery from Bow Tie Pizza. Just thinking about biting into one of those flavourful, meaty, warm slices of goodness is making me salivate all over again. It can be next to impossible fighting pizza cravings, amirite?"}
{"text":"Best gluten free pizza in town, by a long shot!!
The crust comes in it's own metal pan so you know that cross contamination is to a minimal and the pizza/crust is to die for!!
The most amazing item they have is the garlic bread which they don't advertise as gluten free (hint hint, wink wink) but is still available is a complete knock out that comes with a delicious marinara on the side.
The selections are different and offer a great alternative to your regular everyday pizza"}
