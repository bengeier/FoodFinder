{"text":"Went here for lunch in Saturday and it was just okay. We wanted to go for breakfast but didn't wake up early enough lol  We are from the north so I'm familiar with the taste, I liked the spices a lot, but definitely a bit heavy for the first meal of the day lol  The tray you get is so cute since there's a little spot for a bun. The place is quite small but enough food variety for me. It's a mixture of hot cooked food, buns, soups, and cold food that you'd find at a Chinese supermarket. I liked the variety!  I would like to come back for breakfast to try but probably wouldn't do dinner. I don't eat that much so buffet isn't that worth it for me."}
{"text":"This buffet is like the culture about\"north side of China\" ,food may have little bit spicy , if you really can not eat spicy food, just leave this restaurant away.  The dumpling may taste 90% same, but if you are the one who really know about dumpling(know how to make it tasty, Know how to cook, etc), you may satisfaction with their dumpling?very traditional taste of \" northern area's culture of Chinese dumpling(?????\", if you are not the Chinese people, the place may not be a good choice for you."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 start I would ! This restaurant is giving us a false advertising, I went there for lunch with a friend and we went in the waitress told us if we wanted to eat dumplings cost $16.99, otherwise for $12.99 all you get is the food they serve in the keep warm area, and was just warn not even hot!"}
{"text":"I work in Long Term Care now and finish my shift at 7 am . They open at 7 am . Neat and tidy lots of parking space.  You won't miss the outside Red poster 7.99 all u can eat .  Perfect for regular breakfast place. Hand made Steam bun with meat and veggie. Soy milk , lots of various egg dishes .  Meet the j culture .  Congee .  Only be aware some food spicy or salty or hot . I recommend you to try at least one to see if the style meet your expectation ."}
{"text":"Just got here and the price chart is interesting at best. There is actually no price for \"all you can eat  dumpling\" breakfast/lunch/dinner. The price you see is restricted to the hot and cold tables (like the hot plates and antipasta salad bars at a buffet). The only way you can get \"all you can eat dumplings\" is to pay the dinner price at $16.99 each regardless of the time.   We tried six different dumplings. But sadly it didn't equal six different or exciting flavours. To be honest, in cooking you can destroy a meal by overusing any spice and/or herb. The first 5 (pork, no beef) practically all tasted the same. The reason was simply overusing Chinese chives. It's like using five cloves of garlic instead of one in any recipe you are making (getting the picture now? :p).   The hot foods section was more of the same sadly. The Chinese buns and the hot dumplings had the same stuff as the \"all you can eat dumplings\". I think a patron was having some sui gow, but it looked like the stuff I was eating. So pretty much everything tasted the same. By the time your done, you'll be turned off of Chinese chives.  Now what can I say about the sixth dumpling... It was suppose to be the shrimp one. 90% Chinese chives and a tiny chunk of shrimp about the size of my pinkie plus something that looked like egg bits. I figured it was probably just the one but noticed all of them were the same. (see pic).   Someone at the restaurant has a serious Chinese chives fetish. Had they not skimped on the other ingredients, it might have tickled me fancy. So if you enjoy Chinese chives (and I mean overload), then this is the place for you :). If not then I advise you avoid unless you like to belch chives for the rest of the night :D.   The congee was very... unique. The preserved duck egg was like mucous which leads me to believe that it was leftovers. Pretty ick unless you like it that way. They at least didn't destroy the bean pastry I had and the hot lemongrass tea I had.   Now is there any salvaging piece to this place? The restaurant itself was nice and clean. Most of the table and seats are still in mint and shiny condition. The washrooms were nice and clean (except they left the mop and bucket in the men's washroom so space was tight.)  The staff were really nice.   As far as assigning stars now. Novelty wise is a 5 stars. The restaurant and staff are 5 stars, but the food sorry to say is a dismal 1 star. :(  This is something I rarely use.   Overall, not worth paying the $16.99 plus they impose a 10% tip on the bill. (note, I usually tip 15% at most places even the bad ones, so your loss).    Note to owners, we are not in a potato famine here where food is scarce. Yes I know raw materials are getting  expensive, but sticking to just one flavour for everything is going to kill your business. Go to some real dumping places and pick up some tips from them please before it's too late. I'll check in again at some other point in time to see if anything has changed for the better.  Cheers!  Edit: after 4 hours and I'm still burping Chinese chives. Going to be a long night :D Also having problems uploading the tiny bit of shrimp in dumpling photo."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today with my family and it was a terrible experience overall.   First of all, the lunch buffet pricing is misleading as $12.99 only includes the hot/cold side dishes, no dumplings! If you want to boil your own dumplings, the price is $16.99, which is the same as it is for dinner. However, when I looked at the paper menu, it clearly states $14.99 for dumplings. They also boast about having 11 types of dumplings - I counted only 8?   Now, for the hot stations: there were a few dishes that always seemed empty, and when asked by my mother if they would be refilled, our server just awkwardly smiled and said they've already made quite a few batches so we're basically out of luck.   Lastly, there's an automatic 10% tip that wasn't communicated to us until our bill came. Pretty smart business strategy by them given that the subpar service and misleading pricing would not have warranted a tip from us whatsoever.   Oh, the dumplings and food were just ok, but definitely did not justify the cost."}
{"text":"Came by for dinner as suggested by a friend. It's where Fantasy Eatery was.   Thought the concept would be cool to try - all you can eat dumplings (+ other dishes)! It was overall good! A good place if you like northern chinese food like dumplings, cold potato salad, cold pork ears and stuff. They also have desserts like red bean pastry and hot foods like fish, tofu and eggplants.  Restaurant atmosphere - Clean, bright, not too loud (yet). Its a really new resturant, their grand opening flowers/decor still fully intact.   Service - friendly, attentive, they mainly speak Mandarin but I think they are okay with English and Cantonese too (not sure since my mandarin speaking friend did most of the talking but i overheard another customer).   Food - its an interesting concept. For dumplings, you go up to freezers and pick from a sort of dumplings that you then cook at your table - like hot pot. There are around 7 to 10 typesof dumplings to choose from. mostly pork based but there are veggie only and shrimp ones too. For the hot/cold dishes, its like other buffet places you go up to 'stalls' of dishes and just fill up the plate! There were easily 20 or so options. They told us they would start serving lamb skewers soon!!  They also have a few types of drinks that are included as unlimited - tonight were honey green tea, mango juice and honeydew juice. If you want coke or iced tea, those are extra.  Overall the food quality was good like any a la carte dumpling place. They kept the serving small on the stalls so you know they try to keep them fresh by refilling.   Price - they have different prices for adult, kids and infants. and different prices for dinner, lunch and breakfast. for dinner adults its 16.99+tax. I think its fairly priced for the quality and variety."}
