{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I love pizza and have tried hundreds if not thousands of different pizza places all over the US and Canada, and this is one of the worst pizza experiences I've ever had. The place is small and not very clean with almost every table being dirty, but that's forgivable. The cashier was not helpful at all, and often had to consult a menu when I asked what anything was. She got our order wrong and brought us the wrong food. The drinks tasted funny, a bit like dirty water, but they were still better than the water! Unfortunately, the pizza is even worse! The cheese was greasy, frozen, and clearly not pizza cheese, the sauce was bitter and had chili flakes in it, and the crust was burnt and tough. We also had a sub which was not good, either. The only good thing about this experience was the fact that it was empty and they have some TV's which you can watch whatever on. Anyway, all in all, avoid Gus's at all costs. There are plenty of other cheaper, cleaner, more delicious pizza places near by (check into TJ's Pizza down the street)."}
{"text":"I have picked up orders twice from this location. Food is great. Customer service really stinks. The hung up on me by accident, no worries. 
No personality no thank you. 
I ordered a calzone it was delish but both times it was served with cold sauce to dip it in. Cold?
I like the food and it is a great location. I hope they take a look at the team there to wake them up."}
{"text":"I am from Chicago, and was very impressed with this NY style pizza. If they cooked it a bit longer and square cut it, I'd feel right at home. 
I kept it simple with a slice of pepperoni and a slice of BBQ chicken. The crust is almost crispy enough to NOT have to fold it in half to eat it. 
They have a nice deal for lunch if you're super hungry. $4.99-All You Can Eat Pizza. The value shines if you go for a 3rd slice. Good luck with that..... 
I'd swing by for a slice one in awhile, but its not exactly my thing..."}
{"text":"Ordered the Calzone, which was amazing and fairly large. I just wish they mentioned on the website that it came with ricotta cheese inside. The delivery was within the time frame they gave me."}
{"text":"The pizza is not so great- barely had cheese or toppings- and takes forever to make. Not worth it."}
{"text":"I came home tonight w coupons on my door.  I said what the hell.  Hot Wings crispy and pepporo pizza for $14.99 amazing. The only reason why not 5 Stars is delivery guy didn't have dried parm cheese. If u live at Pillars Scottsdale a must"}
{"text":"So bad! I would never return here. Kids said the same thing, I eat a LOT of pizza and this was probably one of the worst I have had. The place is small, dingy and not very clean. (Tables not wiped down, etc.) If you want good cheap pizza got to TJ's down the street. Plus the smoke from Arena Sports Bar next door wafted right into the restaurant, so that added to the bad experience."}
{"text":"About 15 years ago I was a student in the UK facing the usual Friday night, post party, dilemma of kebab (Gyro) or pizza. It was a tough decision and one I was not well equipped for at that time of night. That was until I found an establishment that offered the kebab pizza. In a stroke of genius one man had combined the two best post friday night party foods into one. Kebab meat (Gyro) chopped up and cooked into a cheese pizza as if were meatball or pepperoni.

Fast forward a few years later and here I find myself in Phoenix. Desert and burritos surround me and the best I can hope for meatball or Italian sausage and to close my eyes - dreaming of days gone by. That is, until I found Gus's Pizza.

After a bit of persuasion Gus took on the challenge of creating my beloved pizza from years gone by. A creative man from Greece, he insisted on adding his own little flare of sprinkled feta cheese. Strong move Gus, strong move.

Gus didn't let me down, and neither did the pizza. I'll be going back, don't you worry. The man himself was friendly, as was the lovely lady taking my order. I overheard the delivery lady too and she also seemed friendly. The food is simple, well priced and delicious, exactly how good pizza should be."}
{"text":"Five Stars Plus Plus!  

We are both native New Yorkers, and have been on a quest for the last 28 years here in Arizona to find the perfect New York pizza.  We've taste-tested all over town, and we are so lucky to have found Gus's.  His pizza reminds us of home.  The ingredients are perfect - the crust is fantastic.  The restaurant is clean and the service and the staff are friendly and inviting.  We are now loyal weekly patrons, and are so happy to have him in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible! They are under new owners and the pizza is bland and they didn't even get our basic order correct! The new owners are nice and friendly, but the food is FAR from what it used to be"}
{"text":"It would have been 1 star, but the food wasn't the worst. The driver couldn't find my house after 30 minutes of driving around, luckily my food didn't get too stale, but then again they messed up our order. I was shorted a sandwich and the one I did receive wasn't toasted as asked. When the driver went back to retrieve my missing sandwich, it wasn't even close to what I ordered. The first time I ate here was in May and I really enjoyed it, but the second time around was a waste of $32, and a waste of my time."}
{"text":"Needed an easy dinner after a long day of travel. Randomly chose Gus's and that was a total score! Affordable, fast delivery, and delicious! Had the 18\" pizza with meatballs and extra sauce. Will get again next time we pass through!"}
{"text":"I've come here a handful of times, the $5.00 all you can pizza slices for lunch is a deal hard to beat, whatever toppings you want.  The slices are so big however, I've never been able to eat more than two.  There is large array of toppings to choose from, from the standard pepperoni, sausage, peppers, onions, mushrooms, to buffalo chicken & bbq pulled pork. All of which I thought were pretty damn good.  We have even ordered food from here for all whole office a couple times, with no complaints."}
{"text":"Old owners made the best stromboli and calzone I had ever eaten in my life. That's not an exaggeration, I desperately loved their strombolis and calzones, and I will never get to taste anything like them again, because that are not the same with the new ownership. It is a tragedy of my lifetime."}
{"text":"Probably the worst garlic cheesy bread... The girl on the phone recommended it. I literally was disgusted when I saw it and I tried it because I don't judge foods off how they look.. But it was gross. The pizza was so oily the cheesy wouldn't even stay on it. It wasn't like a lot of cheese it was barley anything and it came off every time I grabbed a slice. Paid 25$ for nothing. Probably the worst pizza experience I've ever had. Never ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I ordered through grubhub.  Horrible service.  Took 1.5 hours to get here.  Jalape√±o poppers came with marinara sauce instead of blue cheese.   Burger and fries were cold and soggy!  They must have been hot when the driver left but the steam in the container made it all soggy.  Fettuccine and meatballs (that I paid $3 extra for).  They took 2 meatballs and cut it in half and put on top of fettuccine making you think you got 4 full meatballs.  Then the deserts were completely squashed in the containers.  I don't have one good thing to say about this place. Don't even bother ordering from here."}
{"text":"Oh My gosh, This has to be the worst pizza I have in 20 years. I tried the 4.99 deal to try the slices and I ordered a slice with sausage and one pepperoni, I was told only one topping for lunch special. I bought a drink from fountain, it had no ice and the pop tasted odd!  I decided to glance at the kitchen since no one was in pizza place at 12:30 (lunch ???), and saw the kitchen help put sausage on my pizza slice with no gloves on. Now what was this weird taste of this slice, Oh the dough was frozen and then baked, the sauce from a bag or can at best and the cheese was tasteless. I am not even mentioning the terrible meat. The place also had a weird smell coming through vents??  I hate Pizza Hut with a passion and I wished I had the pizza from Pizza Hut that use to occupy this location if I did it would been 100% better that what I had."}
{"text":"Pizza crust was nice and crispy and mushrooms were perfectly cooked and flavorful. Not a fan of the Italian sub though."}
{"text":"My daughter stopped in and the pizza was really good. They recommended well done and the crust was nice and crisp. We will be back."}
{"text":"Iv been here 3 times this week and I love it more and more each time. The staff is very friendly and very talkative . The food tastes so fresh and even though it takes time to make it it's well worth it.! If your looking for great tasting pizza look no further !"}
{"text":"This place was FANTASTIC! Owner is from New Jersey and knows how to make a pizza! It's a hidden treasure! Must try!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery of their yummy toasted sandwiches.  Delicious sandwiches and fast delivery.  Recommend the chicken parm sandwich"}
{"text":"I live down the street where TJ's is actually allot closer but after trying this place I just can't go anywhere else. The pizza is authentic NY style the sauce is great vand the toppings fresh. The dough is excellent I love having that crisp but not burned crust definitely rates like the east coast. I get takeout at least twice a week from here and the chicken parmigiana sub is definitely a must have, tonight was the first time I tried it and I was extremely pleased with every piece. The bread was excellent toasted not burnt perfect amount of sauce not dripping everywhere and causing the bread to fall apart and the cheese was excellent as well. Thanks for the excellent food guys."}
{"text":"Placed an order, or thought I was placing an order at 9pm through yelp. Went to pick it up at 9:20 and place was locked up like it was never open. Not open to the time stated. Very disappointed and won't try again."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while. I had gotten a menu left on my door. Then when I saw that they are open till 2:00 AM on Fridays & Saturdays, I was so excited to actual have something open past 10:00 PM in this area. This establishment is .06 miles from my condo. I ordered a pizza and salad online, was charged a 'processing fee' of .49 cents, which isn't a big deal but kinda lame in this day and age of 'paying with plastic'. Also there is a $2.50 charge for delivery, which is the norm just about everywhere. It took almost an hour for my food to get here. They must be busy??  Pizza was really good, I will say, hot, cheesy.   Salad was good too. The delivery driver pounded on my door and didn't say 1 word to me, just handed me my food, I said thank you, he turned around and left. Is this the reason why there are no reviews on this place?  Hmmm, I wanted to give this place 5 stars but couldn't.   Food is a 5, customer service a -3, so I gave it a 4. Give this place a try, maybe pick up your pie, I know I will next time."}
