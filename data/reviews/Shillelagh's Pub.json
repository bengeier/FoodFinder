{"text":"Thursday is $9.99 steak sandwich special. Second time my friend and I went. Tender steaks done perfectly. Nice choice of sides. Nice to have good food in the area. Happy hour with food special....great"}
{"text":"I went there for their wings night, the wings were too dry. The service was not that great but I can't blame the waitress the music was too loud to hear anything I said. The chairs and the table were not as clean as I would have liked them to be. We had to wait for our order for  over 20 minutes and it was not that busy. The place smelled like the bottle depot. I heard good things about this place and I was very eager to try it out. Would go there again if I was in the area and nothing else was open..."}
{"text":"Wednesday Wing Night at Shillelagh's Pub was just O.K. The place is packed on Wednesdays especially after 6, I suggest you try to get their earlier if possible as there is little to no parking in the parking lot. The waitresses are really running around on wing night and service takes a bit longer. The specials on this night include Keith's on tap that was about a $1.00 more than most of the places we go. Wings are $0.30 cents and they have a really vast selection of wing flavours including peanut butter and hot parmesan (with real parmesan on the wings, yummy!!!). We ordered 10 wings which were very saucy but quite small. I had the small meat pizza which was a personal size and had a very hefty amount of meat toppings on it. It was good but a bit greasy. My husband had the chicken burger with fries, burger was tasty, again a bit greasy and the fries were the best fries I've had in a long time. It was also Flames game night and two of the four T.V.'s had UFC on them. The waitress said that one of the customers asked to have UFC on when we asked if the T.V. near us could be changed to the Flames game. I think that if a pub promotes they are going to have the game on, every T.V. should have it on. I'd go here again but probably is not going to be my first choice for Flames Games and wings."}
{"text":"Unimpressed with the service. Waitress wouldn't walk to the kitchen to confirm ingredients in a dressing in case of allergy, and told me they can't make me a regular salad, even though they offer it as a side.   We were acknowledged almost right away, but she walked past us four times after bringing our drinks before asking if we were ready to order - we were just about ready to leave without ordering food. We probably should have.   I used to frequent this place when I lived closer, and I missed it. I now know not to make this mistake again."}
{"text":"I use to love that place but recently, they've been trying to charge me full price on specials, and a few times even after arguing with the manger they screwed me I refuse to go back their again  My friend's have been having the same problem  Fuck that place complete trash"}
{"text":"Ordered a Caesar it was awesome, not too spicy and not too small ;) also got the spicy chicken wrap came pretty quick and super fresh and perfectly cooked! I would absolutely recommend trying this gem out! Very attentive friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Comfortable on a Saturday afternoon getting a brew with some fish 'n chips. Very good service, and the food was excellent. Atlantic cod, fresh fries, went down well with the Stella brew. Going back here next time I'm in Calgary."}
{"text":"Great food and attentive service. The pizza is amazing as are the butter chicken yorkies. Good spot for happy hour on the patio"}
{"text":"Food was great, ground bison shepherds pie. Guinness on tap. Service was fast and friendly. I had no issues at all."}
{"text":"Food has gone downhill along with the service. Competition has grown in the area in recent timesaver accounting for this.   Remains a decent place to watch ufc."}
{"text":"Popped in here for lunch after working on bikes for a bit.  Super-friendly service, okay selection of beer on tap.  The downstairs room has some interesting seating arrangements up against the bay window.  The menu is generic pub, with nothing outstanding.  They used to have a 10-cent wing special on the same night as a draft pitcher special, which led to mayhem.  That is gone, but they do have a cheap burger on Monday nights, plus other specials Tues-Thurs.  Pros: awesome service Cons: Bathrooms reeked of bubblegum and urine  Summary: Nothing special, but you could do much worse."}
{"text":"Shill's is very close to where I live so I frequent it quite often. It used to be a great place to go but it has definitely gone down hill over the past year.  To start, in the men's washroom, one of the two sinks hasn't worked for at least 3 months! Also one of the two soap dispensers has not worked for about the same time.   If you decide to sit at one of the big tables, be careful as the edges are full of slivers and you will either be impaled multiple times and/or wreck your clothes. Too bad that management has decided not to take care of the place. I guess they are not concerned with their regulars going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Every time I come to this place I always end up disappointed. This will be the last time. The service is always sub-par and the drinks and food are about the same. .75 for an extra dip on the side is ridiculous. If for some reason I do go again, I'll be sure to empty the entire bottle of ketchup just to make my point."}
{"text":"Even for a pub, this food was crap.  Ordered the Quinoa Salmon salad.  Salmon was dry, overcooked.  Greens had several gross wilted bits.  Grape tomatoes had funny flavor.  Dressing was watery and not flavourful. Cucumber was soggy.  Friend had beef taco salad.  Beef was dry and not flavourful.  Miserly portion of meat.  Wilted greens, too.  Only good thing apparently was her Caesar.  Whoopie.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend went here for dinner the other night and had high expectations due to man friends saying that it was an amazing place unfortunately it wasn't at all.  When we arrived it took way to long for a waitress to come ask us what we wanted to drink and just the same as for when we needed to order are food,  Once we got are food are appys where pretty much the same as oj's up the road & once are mains came her pasta was over cooked somehow.... Amazing that any \"chef\" could over cook pasta and the burger  I ordered was wayyy wayyy over cooked, once we where done the bill was extremely high for the servos we got... Safe to say don't ever go here"}
{"text":"The pizza is great, and the staff were pretty awesome. I have been here a couple times before, and frankly found it pretty average. But having the chance to take a brief evening for dinner to enjoy the patio, have a (pretty fantastic) pizza, and be remarkably impressed by the genuine good naturedness of our server Ali, I think I may have underestimated this place.  Thanks for a great evening!"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Shillelagh's, pretty much every time I'm in Calgary I go. It gets a bad wrap but I've never had terrible service and the food is usually pretty good every time. It's within stumbling distance of my house so that's always a plus.  I particularly like the steak strips, and of course the wings are good! The JD APPLE BBQ is a must for anyone trying flavours.   It can get busy! The upstairs part is the best place to watch the hockey games!"}
{"text":"The only thing worse then the food, was the service! Don't go here!!!  We originally came here because our first choice for a restaurant was a two hour wait just to get in. When we first walked in, I noticed it was a ghost town only a few tables occupied. This should have been our first clue that something was amiss....no people there when other places were packed on a holiday Friday.    We found a table and the waitress came over and took drink orders. She couldn't even remember our orders and didn't write them down. It also took her a long time to finally bring the drinks and take our order, despite there being at least 3 waitresses to wait on maybe 5 tables of people.   Putting in our orders, after what seemed like an eternity of waiting, was also a bit of an ordeal. One of the people I was with is DEATHLY ALLERGIC to seafood, and we ordered the $43 platter (way OVERPRICED for what you get) We asked if the calamari could be put on a separate plate, otherwise he would not be able to eat anything on the platter. We then proceeded to ask if there was anything else on the platter that contained seafood. She said NO, NOTHING. The rest of us put our orders in without incident and she left....for an extremely long time, never came back to check on us once. Our food arrived brought to us by pretty much anyone but our waitress. We all began to eat, I grabbed a spring roll off the platter and bit into it and quickly realized this was a \"SHRIMP\" spring roll. Luckily I was able to warn my friend not to eat it with only seconds to spare! Otherwise our dinner would have ended in a trip to the HOSPITAL! From then on he was not able to eat anything on the highly overpriced platter and was afraid to. We mentioned this to our waitress when she finally came back to see how everything was. All we got was a ditsy, \"oops sorry, I forgot.\" By that time, nearly everyone at the table needed a refill on drinks (30 min wait we counted) and so we all ordered, not knowing if she would ever come back. We asked her if she had all our orders and were told, yep I have it, yep I have it. She actually quickly came back with drinks for three out of five people, but then disappeared never to be seen again. Upon looking around the empty bar, she could be seen at the bar clearly flirting with one of the few other patrons in the place. Finally, irritated we went to the bar ourselves to get a refill. We told the bartender she was completely useless! Luckly....sort of....for us the manager was sitting right beside where we complained. After that he came to our table to see how we were doing, but he was less than helpful. At least our waitress was \"talked to\" and after that we started getting some service but she was very frosty towards us!   The food was all less then good, bordering on gross, and poorly made and the nacho chips were stale. No one out of 9 people was happy with their meal!"}
{"text":"Wings went up in price to 40 cents each, they are small and over cooked! Mild was too hot for us with no flavour!! Server forgot my water and martinis are just okay!! Not my favourite place!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here after taking the CTrain into the city (Calgary) for the day and before heading back to our Motorhome. It is Wing Wednesday. We had the Parmesan Baked wings - they were so far my favorite wings if all time - baked nicely good flavor with an easy kick on the finish (light spice) we then had to order another round and went with the Jack Daniel's BBQ. A bit more  messy...ok a lot more messy, but great balance between sweet & tangy. We sat at the bar. The atmosphere has a neighborhood feel. TVs throughout. The bartender was attentive. This is the kind of place I'd like to have close by us (we are visiting Calgary from So. Calif.) I would give 5 stars, but reserve that level for when we have full meal and table service."}
{"text":"this is formerly jamiesons in 36th street NE right across the superstore gas station. We went in there, and there were FLIES----everywhere. the cutleries were dirty. we have to wait like 10 mins and it wasnt busy at all...i finally got up and left. I was upset coz i was really hungry... anyways, NEW name, POOR service and HYGIENE!"}
