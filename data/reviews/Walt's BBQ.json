{"text":"They now serve cheap and fresh breakfast now, think they open at 7am.   I had the bbq ribs and my wife had the brisket sandwich.   We both LOVED IT.   Also had the peach cobbler and the honny bunnies....OMG!!!  Amazing, absolutely amazing.     I'm going to check out the breakfast, seen the menu which is pretty small but its a great price and I know it will be fresh.   5 stars baby!    Loved it."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good BBQ, this is the place.  But if you're trying to watch your sodium intake, then stay away.  They smoke all of their own meat and bottle their own BBQ sauce.  The food was delicious, service quick and very courteous, and the portions were filling.

The pricing was a bit high, especially if you go for lunch.  Sandwhichs are around $8 (includes 2 sides).  Throw in a drink and you're pushing $10.  A dinner meal is $17-$22 which, for a \"look-up\" is pricey.  All meals come with 2 sides which are decently sized.  

The theme of the restaurant is...interesting.  After reading the website, I learned that it is \"man cave, sport garage\" but I still don't get the connection with BBQ.  No worries though, the food makes it all good."}
{"text":"Walt's is a good choice for real BBQ in the desert. They offer traditional smoked BBQ with a variety of really amazing sauces. Pork, Brisket, Ribs, Chicken, offered up in a variety of ways. The sides are what you'd expect from a BBQ Joint: Cole Slaw, Baked Beans, Tater Salad, Fries, Mac'n'Cheese, and my favorite the smoked rice. The best part is that it's not that pricey, and you get a TON of food. On some nights, I've noticed they had a gentlemen in there providing live music - lots of blues, jazz, and the standard fair. He was actually really good! Give them a shot, it's something different in the West Valley and they make a mean set of ribs."}
{"text":"***CLOSED in July***

I could had swore that I wrote a review about this place when I went in a couple months ago, but I didn't...maybe I forgot or maybe it's because I would had felt bad writing my review, esp when you have a feeling that a place is just shy of closing its doors. Let's just say that I'm not surprised that it closed. :(  

(I would had given them 3-stars, not that it matters much now).

I like to try out indie restaurants...maybe this location is just bad luck...as this is the second restaurant to open and close it's doors within a few years..."}
