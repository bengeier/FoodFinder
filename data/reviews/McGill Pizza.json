{"text":"Our favourite pizza place - still as good as it was twenty years ago.

The perfect place to get your pizza fix, and great for a cheap breakfast too. The best greasy spoon in the McGill ghetto. Don't expect anything fancy, food or decor-wise. The staff are great, some have been there since my university days."}
{"text":"Stayed at McGill for a few days and looked for what the kids are into these days, walked on Milton and saw \"McGill Pizza\" shit said its been there for 50 years so it must have been legit to some extent. I was wrong, worst pizza ive ever had and the dude was straight up hustling us. Had the McGill Special and the Fish and Chips, tasted horrible #iCantEven"}
{"text":"First off, not a fan of their pizza. Also the food there is nothing special. But it's a really nice diner in the McGill ghetto serving all day breakfast for quite a reasonable price. And everyone there is always very nice and friendly, which is the best part part of going there regularly."}
{"text":"The other reviews mirror my thoughts on McGill Pizza.  It's in no way, shape, or form, the pinnacle of fine dining; however, if you're looking for a quick, reasonably priced bite to eat, it certainly fits the bill.  I tend to go for the chicken pita or the veggie pizza.  The pizza is particularly good, with a thin crust and a myriad of toppings.  For a lunch between classes, this is a nice change from the food courts, chain restaurants, and McGill cafeterias."}
{"text":"I like the vibe here but if be lying to say the pizza is great

I got a single slice and it was way over priced  It was very much reheated possibly from yesterday

Still, there is something likeable about this place.  It is a totally unpretentious genuine greasy spoon in an area where that is actually a real novelty.

The staff are really nice

I wil go back but honestly the pizza at the Pizza Pizza outlets on McGill campus is much better."}
{"text":"i've never had a slice of pizza there that i thought was any good, and it's really not that cheap, but it's adequate i guess."}
{"text":"So after a more upscale review of a pizza place, onto McGill pizza!  I wasn't joking when I said I loved pizza!

McGill Pizza is the perfect place to order pizza from when you need pizza for a crowd.  It's reasonably priced, especially when you order multiple pizzas and take advantage of their discounts.  And it's more than a piece of cardboard with a little cheese and sauce, it's a filling pizza that is really quite tasty. They don't cheap out on toppings!  They even allow credit card payments on delivery (provided you tell them when ordering), which is great when you're ordering pizza for a crowd."}
{"text":"Pizza is average and slightly overpriced. However, the place is ideal for brunch (they actually serve it at anytime), and for watching football (or any other sports)."}
{"text":"I really enjoy their subs and the poutine they serve here. The service is also friendly and quick regardless of the time of day or night. But the establishment is a little dirty specially the bathrooms. Atleast tonight... Overall i belive i will return here."}
{"text":"Let's just get this straight out of the way, I'm not the biggest fan of their pizza. Plenty of people seem to love it, they just don't have the selection of fussy vegetarian options that I look for.

That being said, the other menu options, and the quality of the service combine to earn this place the four stars I've given it.

The service is always warm and friendly, and there aren't many places in MTL that do a good all day breakfast (and the ones that do tend to charge way too much). They're also willing to accommodate via substitution, not subtraction.

My only complaint about the eggs and homefries is that it was a touch on the bland side; I worry that they rely too much on the meat part of the dish for salt and seasoning (which for me was replaced with veg* options).

Still one of my fav \"hole in the wall\" locations though."}
{"text":"Great staff. Great breakfast and pizza. Classic McGill spot."}
{"text":"So this is a greasy spoon favoured by many McGill students. They have very cheap breakfast, burger specials, and pizza. Don't expect to eat healthy here, but it's cheap and the staff is very nice."}
{"text":"worst. place. ever. well dont order pizza by the slice and fish n chips were disgusting. couldnt even finish the greasy ass fish. tasted like ass. i do t know what other yelpers been eating with them good reviews but imma keep it real. dont waste ur money here."}
{"text":"This is a review for their breakfast only! (There are reviews on other stuff that aren't so great, but breakfast is great so get that)
Anyways, most reasonably priced brunch place in Montreal , about $7-8 for bacon, sausage, eggs, toast, potatoes, coffee and OJ. 
Two drinks! Included! 
I live right around the block so I really benefit from this deal. And it's delicious too. 
Great place for mcgill students! It's called mcgill pizza but the pizza isn't amazing, so they should change their name to mcgill breakfast."}
{"text":"If your going somewhere like this don't expect super duper supreme delights. This place is simple and down to Earth. The food is great for the price you pay which makes it a super bargain.  Makes for a good place to catchup with friends and get a quick bite to eat. The services is very quick and friendly. Not to mention the coffee is pretty good as well. I feel like this is a notable spot in the ghetto student community."}
{"text":"Not that great of a pizza. I just ordered a medium pepperoni and sausage pizza. The sausage didn't taste like Italian sausage, but instead some sort of summer sausage. That flavor threw the rest of the pizza off. Another big problem with this pizza is that there was hardly any sauce on it. The pepperoni was hardly noticeable for two reasons. First, the sausage overwhelmed the pizza. Second, the pepperoni was sliced really thin. The cheese was thick but nothing special. The crust was alright, and was very similar to Home Run Inn Pizza. Still, the flavor of this pizza just seemed totally off."}
{"text":"I got a pizza and fries, neither of which were anything special. However, I liked that they served me on a real, non-paper plate and had somewhat nicer décor than the average MTL pizza establishment, and the guy at the counter was nice. I'd only go here regularly if I lived in the building above, but I don't regret knowing what it's like."}
{"text":"They serve breakfast all day for about 6 $, you get the eggs, sausage, toast, coffee and juice. A good place for a cheap slice of pizza too. However, I can't say that it's in the top 25% of pizza joints in Montreal. The decor is very plain. But there's a cozy feel to it and I was a regular during my college years. I still try to go once a month or so."}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the the BEST old school pizza and spaghetti restaurants in Montreal. Will make you miss your Nonna!"}
{"text":"Situated right across the Milton Gates of McGill's downtown campus, This place is a lengend among McGill students alike. Fast and inexpensive, this little diner offers an extensive menu to satisfy a wide range of cravings. A unique creation featured on their menu is called the \"Pizzaghetti\", which is a dish consisting of half spaghetti and half a pizza of your choice. This option is perfect for those who have trouble deciding what to eat for lunch and want to have a little twist on the classic pizza meal. Overall, this place is forever a classic lunch joint for all McGill students :)"}
{"text":"I've seen some reviews being pretty harsh with this place, but the food is only mediocre if you compare it with upscale restaurants. For the price, the food is surprisingly decent, and the breakfast specials are great in quality and value. Service is top-notch, and the food comes out quick. If you stick with their standards (breakfast, pizza, etc) you really can't go wrong in terms of value."}
{"text":"Ok, je suis sur du nom, mais je ne suis pas sur de l'adresse, est-ce que je me trompe? C'est la Pizzeria dans l'underground de MTL qui lie Place Ville-Marie au Centre Eaton. Pour les non-initié de Montréal, c'est indescriptible, mais pour les gens qui travaille dans le coin et qui passe par là tous les jours pour leur lunch, c'est pas cher, c'est vraiment un très bon deal et la pizza est honête et la croute est bonne. J'aimerais dire que j'ai un top 5 des meilleurs pizza cheap de Montréal pas parce qu'elles sont meilleures ou quoi que ce soit, Mais trouvé un lunch a moins de 10$ qui n'est pas Mcdo ou Thai Express, c'est dur! Même les pizzeria de centre d'achat coûte cher! J'ai 3 pointes (de jumbo 20pouce) et une boisson gazeuse pour 8-9$! Hell yeah!"}
{"text":"You wouldn't think it, but it's surprisingly decent pizza for a joint below a high rise. The crust is nice and crispy, the cheese is super gooey, and the topping to sauce ratio is spot on. They also have fries and various other greasy spoon fare. 

There's really not much more to say. It's kind of an institution in the ghetto, and it's not going anywhere, so you might as well stop in for a slice."}
{"text":"my friends got pizza and I got their all day breakfast.

The all day breakfast is solid, for ~8$ you can get a decent amount of food (potatoes, 2 eggs, 2 pieces of meat, 2 slices of bread, fruit) which tastes just fine. I'd say for the price, it would get a 7.5/10.

the pizza seemed to be a little expensive for the amount and quality, coming out to ~$23 after tip and tax for a large which feeds 2 hungry people modestly. The location is great for McGill students, and the service was just fine. It's a nice, well decorated little diner.

Atmosphere: 8/10
Food: 6/10
Price (breakfast): 8/10
Service: 8.5/10"}
{"text":"Average food. Somewhat overpriced. 
Location highly convenient. 
Staff is generally friendly and helpful. 

Basically just a regular dinner with generic food."}
{"text":"McGill Pizza is a small, diner-style restaurant located just east of McGill's main campus. There aren't many places to sit, but I know a lot of people get takeout and/ or delivery. The service was good, albeit somewhat slow. Slow service doesn't usually bother me, but the restaurant was empty. The menu has several options, but there's definitely not much for those with any sort of food restrictions. Everything is very cheap, so I understand why so many students frequent this restaurant. 

All in all, this restaurant is nothing special, but definitely a good choice for those on a budget who like diner food."}
{"text":"I usually dont rank fast-food places so high, but if I rank it as a fast-food place it is at least a 4 star place. Sure the Pizza maybe a little too oily but it taste great, the food is inexpensive and the biggest advantage of this place is its atmosphere. If you are a student this is one of those student places you always saw in the movies, if you are not a student anymore and feeling nostalgic walk inside for a trip down memory land. Overall inexpensive food+tasty+great atmosphere = a place I will defiantly visit again."}
{"text":"We ordered two extra large pizzas. Both were fantastic. The crust is very good. I kept finding reasons to keep eating the crusts! Great service.... Of course we were the only ones in the place at the time... Very friendly. Reasonably priced."}
