{"text":"The staff and the food here are amazing. Sasha is the most incredible server and bartender I've ever encountered. She is so engaging and sweet and caring. She never quits being attentive to her guests. It is clear she loves what she does and makes not only me but everyone want to come back. I can't even say enough great things about this location"}
{"text":"The scene is definitely better than the food, but I have to give it 4-stars for the happy hour menu.  In total they have over 20 items to choose from - sushi and appetizers, most under $5.  I believe it runs from 3p-7p.  Good looking wait staff and a nice decor.  

Agreed - walking around Kierland is a nice way to work off lunch, or perhaps across the street to the Westin.

We'll be back for happy hour again!"}
{"text":"The food is simply awesome! Whether it's fresh sashimi or sushi or cooked stuff, you won't be disappointed. The calamari tempura is a must try! I would have given it 5stars except that the servers are not very attentive to those sitting inside."}
{"text":"Everyone must try the Las Vegas Roll! Best thing i've had on the menu!"}
{"text":"I've been quite happy with Ra recently. When they first opened in Phoenix several years ago, the sushi and the service were, in my humble opinion, rather mediocre. Over the years, however, the food has gotten more innovative and become very good. I am a HUGE fan of the Hot Mess (crab sauce baked with jalapenos and sweet eel sauce atop crispy rice patties) and my mom loves their grilled salmon. Their sushi happy hour has quite a bit of variety and the value is pretty good for Scottsdale. Another thing I've noticed at both the Kierland and Old Town locations is that the service is consistently excellent. There was an error in one of our orders recently and our sweet server made it right tout suite! 

Yes, the acoustics....they leave a lot to be desired. I get it: it's a rock 'n' roll sushi bar so loud music is part of the ambience. If you have a hearing loss or if you have difficulty tolerating loud music - be forewarned. I actually prefer to go when it's busier because there are more bodies to absorb the sound of the music. When it's slower, those hard surfaces (tables, glass windows) really make those sound waves bounce. 
Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials!!!! Love the crunchy spicy tuna roll...."}
{"text":"Quite surprisingly (but in a pleasant way), this joint had some pretty darn good sushi.  I mean, really - landlocked?  Desert?  Where water is uber-scarce?  They put on a good happy hour.  We stuffed ourselves with edamame, salmon and tuna nigiri, squid salad, 'RA'ckin shrimp, Vegas roll, rainbow roll, salmon carpaccio, and a couple other yummies.  Their sake sangria was quite tasty.

One thing I could've done without was the music volume - we had to yell to converse, and I felt like I was in a dance club.  Turn it down, yo!"}
{"text":"Have lost count of how many times I've eaten inside and on the patio.  Perfect for chilled healthy food in the AZ summer, especially during Happy Hour when the Sushi & drinks are deeply discounted.  The food & service are consistently fabulous, and the atmosphere fun.  Fun to shop till you drop at the Kierland shops afterward."}
{"text":"Awesome ... One of the Cleanest most executed Bars in the Kierland District.... The Place is Spotless ... Danielle the bartender is like a full time house made ... Great food ... Clean ... Friendly ... Happy Hour ... Thanks ... Was so impressed by the service and Staff ... Literally Danielle the Bartender is like a house cleaner and so friendly... amazing work :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on Friday for Happy Hour. the sushi was just okay but the Happy Hour drink specials were amazing. We did a bunch of saki bombs and the sushi started to taste better ... hahaha.  My favorite shshi place is here in NJ called Sushi Lounge, after eating here, hard to find another match."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places in az. I'm from California so my sushi standards are high and while there is no comparison to Cali sushi, this is a close second. Ive tried about 6 sushi places in az and been dissapointed and felt totally ripped off but ra has some great deals and quality for your money. 

My favorite is the seared tuna with a sweet onion sauce and their salmon roll with asparagus. Everything is fresh and fast. The bartender Eric ALWAYS takes great care of us and always has some entertaining and morally objective stories to keep us entertained. 

They USED to have a great happy hour menu but they changed it and I am not impressed . I haven't been back for hh since the change and I hope they revert to the original hh menu. 

One nice touch is they are good about pouring your beer/saki in a nice cold/hot glass and refilling it as it goes down. Its the little touches that matter!"}
{"text":"The girl at the front desk is so rude at the loment that i payed ibgave her the cash in her hand and when she gave me back my change she just set it in the table instead of handing it to me like i did as well every single timebi said thankyou she replyed back with a mmmhhh that is just plain rude!!!and she didnt even bother to give me a reciept as well i will not be coming back to this location again plus the viva las vegasbroll was not asgood as they used to be a while back....it was just mediocre...."}
{"text":"Eh, this place is not good. The food isn't fresh, and it just plain tastes bad. It is far too pricey for how mediocre it is. The service is also not so good, and the servers can be a bit unfriendly.

The only time I would ever come here is when my friends want to go here (even then, I try to tell them not to go!). The happy hour can be okay, but I would definitely rather go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Not authentic, but tasty in its own way.

I go here for happy hour.
I really like the viva las vegas roll.
The crab cakes are of good value.
Fried calamari is a bit bland but worth the volume (big)

Off the happy hr menu, my fav is the scallop dynamite roll.
either you love it or hate it. It took me a couple tries to appreciate it.


the desert roll (bananas fried and topped with fruits, w/ a hint of white chocolate chip) was surprisingly good.

Walking around the mall after dinner is pretty relaxing.

Do not get the tempura icecream here.
It was nasty."}
{"text":"I work near this Ra location, which is the only reason I end up here when I get a craving for a spicy tuna bowl. 

It's just like all the rest...too loud, random happy hour, obnoxious and rude hostesses, nice bartenders and late hours (which is a bonus since everything else short of the OC closes at 9!!!). BUT, I do enjoy that spicy tuna bowl for lunch!!

Also, they do have a 'Nooner Card' that is stamped for each lunch you have and after I think 8, you get a free one! That free one always seems to taste soo good!!

The rest of the sushi is average and predictable and their iced green tea is good. I honestly recommend just getting it to go and saving yourself the rest of the experience!"}
{"text":"Had a really good Anniversary dinner here. Big menu but the delivered on everything that we tried. 

Looks like they have a pretty solid happy hour too. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is a treat. The service was good, the sushi was on par, and the atmosphere was pleasant. This Ra location could not be in better company (Sapporo's, Cheese Cake Factory, Mastro's Ocean Club, Morton's Steakhouse) all located within walking distance. Our server was very helpful and full of suggestions when we asked for them. It's always an added bonus to have a good looking staff as well. Hannah is by far the best server in the place. She's always quick and very attentive and she has a very pleasant demeanor, and she looks....well, seductive. Unfortunately, as is the case with many chains, the beer line up could use some improvement. How about some Labatte's Blue, Sagres, or Sam Miguel for example? Come to think of it, the wine needs a polish as well. Some Gazela, Lotengo, or Villa Maria would fit in nicely with the current line up. I mean it's not like were trying to dine in North Korean now is it? Overall the food is a solid B. Teriyaki chicken, rolls, tempura, you name it and Ra has it. The rolls are pretty reasonable, especially the regular rolls. As far as proximity goes, Ra is at the top of the heap, considering that Barcelona is just two blocks away."}
{"text":"I work in the area and decided to meet a couple friends for dinner. Wrong decision. The place was busy. But not packed i.e. several open tables that just needed busing. 
The hostesses were unnecessarily rude and threw a lot of sass about how \"it is a Friday night\". Fine. I can take a rude 17 year old. But I don't think it takes 3 hostesses to do the job. How about clearing the empty tables we've been staring at for the past 40 minutes? 

The ladies room was disgusting. The stalls were out of supplies and in need of attention. 

The waitress seemed like she could care less about her job. 

The food was mediocre (it's Ra we're talking about) and an item was ultimately comped due to the ineptitude of multiple servers. 

Needless to say, there are much better choices around the Kierland area with both better food and service. 

I was so over the whole experience. From beginning to end. Not even worth it for Happy Hour. Meh."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and it's never stellar. it's always decent, but nothing memorable. tonight was the worst it has been though. the scallop dynamite was almost inedible it was so gross. the chicken kabob things were kinda dry and the chicken was hard and rubbery. the teriyaki  beef was decent but nothing to write home about. the pineapple shrimp salad was great as always!"}
{"text":"Ra Sushi was my favorite go to patio at Kierland.  Great people watching location and great food.  However, I have to wonder what they were thinking when they chose the new location on Scottsdale road.  Tried it for the first time today and the food is still consistently great, but the new location is horrible!  Sitting on that patio is like lunching on the side of a highway!  Cars and large trucks roaring past  does not make a relaxing patio experience!  They needed to take some of their renovation dollars and build a wall with water feature to block the view of the road and the noise or at least plant some tall bushes. Not sure if the food is worth the awful patio.  So sad!!  Will miss the old relaxing location."}
{"text":"Put a ToGo order in for a later pick-up. They forgot to put it in. Showed up and they apologized and comp'd the order without me having to complain."}
{"text":"Hostesses need training. We were very disappointed with the level of service that one would expect from the Kierland Commons. We do not mind waiting if the demand for tables is high. But it is grossly unfair to allow other customers to cut in line ahead of folks who have been waiting patiently. Fortunately there are many dining choices in the neighborhood and Phoenix as a whole so we ate a great meal somewhere else. We may try you again someday, but I doubt it. Good luck competing with restaurants that value their customers. There still are a few around.....

In response to an email that I sent directly to RA, I received a prompt reply from the GM. I would like to commend him for his attentiveness to my concerns. I understand that situations may happen when customers feel slighted, but when managers step forward to apologize and attempt to right a wrong, customers should grant them the credit that is due. Thank you Mr Stidham for a job well done! I will visit RA the next time I return to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"It was 9:56 pm... The late night cravings were kicking in. First thought, sushi. I went onto Yelp and \"RA\" was one of the few that was open late. I decided to give it a shot. I ordered the shrimp calamari tempura roll, shrimp tempura roll, scallop nigiri, sweet shrimp w/head, and spicy tuna handroll. We have never ordered sushi to go, but we figured it would be good considering it was a 25 minute wait. Peering into the bag we noticed there were several containers. Although one stood out to us. Half were green and half were pink. We didn't think anything of it, just thought it was a different style. Let's just say waaaay too much cream cheese. As we took our first bite, we realized we messed up and went to the wrong place. The food was mediocre at best. Scallop was too chewy. Rice was too sticky. This sushi was definitely made by someone who watched too much anime. The interior of the restaurant looked like the red light district too. It is safe to say that I will not be recommending this restaurant to anyone, not even my worst enemy.

Maybe they'll hire some real chefs one day and make some real sushi. xoxo-gossip girl"}
{"text":"Went to Ra visiting from out of town. While the sushi is great, the hostess forgot our table, the sushi took about 30 minutes to be served, and when I got ID'd (despite being 23!) they wouldn't serve me because I had a vertical license (which doesn't expire for 10 years in Virginia where I'm from). They couldn't loon at my birth date??? Even speaking to be manager he would t give me the time of day."}
{"text":"Prompt service. In and out. Had a nice time here. Not too packed. Great crowd and the server was quite attentive. The drinks are on point and I have no concerns/issues with the meals we ordered. As with most RA locations, ambiance is Good....Food is good....Service is good. It got the job done."}
{"text":"We just got back to NY from a stay in Scottsdale and loved Ra so much we went there twice!  The happy hour deal is ridiculous.  The Ra'kin Shrimp roll was soooo different from anything we've ever had.  Great food, great service, great ambiance.  Def lives up to NY sushi standards."}
{"text":"This is my favorite RA. The best time to go is for the lunch specials or happy hour! Otherwise I feel that it can be a bit pricey! On Tuesdays they have the by one get one lunch special if you are apart of the \"hooked up\" email list. My favorite lunch special is the salmon bento box! Service is usually pretty good! Chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great sushi place!!! The size of the meat on each piece was huge. Service was excellent. Clean and nice atmosphere. The food was so fresh. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Good lunch and happy hour specials. The sashimi lunch special for about $12 officially gets you 12 slices of fish (with shiso leaves! - love those things)....miso soup, and a salad. Ra's rolls are just average for me...so I don't particularly like ordering them. The sashimi is nice and fresh, though. All in all, Ra is a good value and worth a visit for a simple meal (sashimi).

When I have visited, the restaurant is clean, and the service is good."}
{"text":"Great presentation, great service, great tasting food.  Simple and easy, no hassle tasty food.  Just how I like it."}
{"text":"I really like their sushi and salads. Really good. What I don't like is the extreme wait times for our food to come out, the bad service, and it really annoys me to have to ask for silverware each time and 90% of the time, they forget to bring it to me! Love the food, hate everything else about this place. When I have the patience to put up with bad service, I come here."}
{"text":"Ra is always a fun restaurant. Great food and atmosphere. Love the Vegas roll. Great for Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"I have to say its not a Sushi connoisseur's favorite but Its one of our favorite places for happy hour. If you like Hot Saki there only a buck each and It only takes two for me. Meanwhile my wife blows the rest of our budget on apple martinis.  I recomend the Spicy \"Crispy\" Tuna Rolls, even though they make my teeth sting for some weird reason. Half off a bunch of their delicious apps before 7PM.  If your going to each the Sashimi I would just recomend asking the sushi chef's whats fresh that day and stick to it. Very consistent service. I wouldn't bring kids there but I don't have a problem when others bring theirs."}
{"text":"Sushi good - but nothing special or creative. Appetizers and small plates are very good. Happy hour specials bring us in, although they aren't as good as they used to be. Mediocre to poor service. A lot of activity - people watching place."}
{"text":"Fun Americanized sushi bar.  Usually packed with a 30-something crowd at the bar.  Loud music.  Sushi is average, but what you would expect from a place like this.  Service is good.  If you want drinks with some sushi on the side, this is a great place.  If you want authentic, try Hiro Sushi instead."}
{"text":"I go to this location all the time truly because I think they have the best spicy tuna roll in town, they always get my order perfectly how I want it, and their happy hour is amaze. I always sit at the bar and and the service is just...meh. Like I usually feel invisible. But tonight the bartender seriously was so nice and went out of his way to even suggest other items on the menu to me. That's the whole reason I sit at the bar. To get that kind of service and chat with people a bit. I'm social, what can ya do? Kudos to Khalid for seriously just putting me in a good mood and feeding me all the sush."}
{"text":"What a great experience we had on our FIRST time here.  The service and food were outstanding!  Could not be happier.

My husband gets his hair cut next door, at V's, so I met him there for Happy Hour and sat outside.  We were seated immediately.  Our server was very cheery and helpful.  The place is very clean.  Great Atmosphere.  
Now, if only my husband could get his hair cut EVERY WEEK, so that we can stop in at RA, life would be perfect!"}
{"text":"Ordered two of the chicken skewer appetizers.  BOTH came out raw.  The manager never addressed the issue; he never came out to speak to us or apologize.  Instead he simply took them off the bill...after I ate a piece.  RAW CHICKEN is BAD especially when someone eats a piece and was going to serve it to their children.  I addressed the manager with my concern, and he had nothing to say.  We've patronized this business before, but we won't be back...not sane service or same quality."}
{"text":"This sushi bar is wonderful. Marlena was our bartender/waitress and was great. She was so helpful in picking out items that were gluten free and delicious. With allergies its sometimes difficult to tell what's in everything. Both the sushi and drinks were good."}
{"text":"New location is awesome, great indoor outdoor feel. Staff was professional and sushi was really good."}
{"text":"RA sushi has some of the nicest and friendliest staff I've ever experienced. From the hostess' to the waiters everyone's polite and helpful. Plus awesome sushi ontop of that makes it a great place to go."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service and sushi food. I have been to several places but this one takes the cake for being the worst. The waitress disappeared without coming back with the change. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"Decent sushi joint, but the quality of their rolls was not as good as their old town location.  Definitely try the garlic edamame appetizer - it does not disappoint.  For a premium roll, the \"Las Vegas\" is incredible."}
{"text":"Consistently good sushi.  Service is good, not great, but good.  Today I had nigiri sushi.  Mackerel, halibut, yellowtail, and Hawaiian yellowtail.  Each one was very good.  The spicy lobster roll was very spicy today, which was perfect for me, but might be too much for some."}
{"text":"Place was so dead on a Saturday night. I ordered a simple Chinese chicken salad and it did not taste good at all. Sushi wasn't the greatest either. I would definitely not be going back there."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight with 6 in our party.  We ordered shrimp tempura sushi, caterpillar roll, spicy tuna rolls and several appetizers.  Food was delicious and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"From beginning Til end service was horrible. I was better off serving myself rather than my server. She had known my brothers and I were wanting to eat and I went to a table that was already prepped to get my silverware. At first I thought maybe because we came in at 11 and they're about to close in another hour. But it couldn't be that since she was a way better server to two other people who came in later than us. She immediately got them plates and silverware. Once our food came she came midway bringing soy sauce and such. We had only gotten one little bowl to pour it in. We all double dip so I just put my soy sauce on my plate. The food was good, the service not so much. Very tempted to write her name down but I don't know, maybe she was having an off night."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great atmosphere and fast service. If you go I recommend catching the Happy Hour before 7 and order a good spread to share with drinks. Servers are polite and have good recommendations if you are not sure what to order."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for my bday and our anniversary dinner. I just had twins a few months ago so I hadn't had sushi in almost a year! Way too long to wait if you ask me!!! We got a table on the patio and ordered a ton of sushi off the happy hour menu. Service is what you would expect during a busy happy hour, not horrible but not fantastic either. We had to ask for bowls for our soy sauce twice, which sucked waiting to dig in to my sushi after such a long wait! Sushi was decent as were the prices. We'll be back, celebration or not."}
{"text":"The food: absolutely great.  Started off with the pineapple cheese wontons - really, really good, but if you don't eat the coleslaw they're served on, you missed the best part!  Tempura rolls were something special, the others were quite good as well.   Really enjoyed it!

The service: fair.  The ordering with a checklist thing was annoying, and it didn't work well.  We ordered 4 types of rolls, only got 3, had to ask for the fourth one.  Hello?  It was in writing!

The ambience: Ouch.  Maybe it was because it was happy hour, but as we sat there the music got louder and louder.  By the time we left, it was almost to the point of pain.

Recommendation: Do carryout, so you can enjoy the food without audio assault."}
{"text":"Best sushi happy hour I've been too. Gotta get the crispy spicy tuna and the shishito peppers.  Great patio too."}
{"text":"The Ra in Kierland has one of my favorite patios in AZ. Awesome happy hour."}
{"text":"Sitting here right now. It was an interesting experience.  Apparently now they don't serve sushi without wasabi and ginger?   It's a sushi restaurant! You have to ask for it because they want to \"conserve costs\"

I had the teriyaki chicken which was served with rubbery chicken and vegetables that matched the chicken. The service was also VERY slow. The only highlight of this place was that it doesn't smell like the old one did.  I do NOT recommend this place and will not be going"}
{"text":"I love this place! I will never go to another sushi place again. Service is wonderful, drinks are always spot on, and sushi is always amazing. This is also the first sushi place that doesn't make my husbands stomach upset - so not many can compete with that!"}
{"text":"Had the standard rolls - spicy tuna and spicy salmon, plus the mango lobster roll, which was quite a departure from the usual roll flavors. An enjoyable experience during happy hour - prices for rolls are very good."}
{"text":"Delicious food for a great price, short wait times. I recommend the Unagi and Shrimp Tempura rolls and the Pork Gyoza!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was amazing. The sushi was fresh but lacked pizzaz and taste. My order was incorrect and the waitress was busy so i ended up just shutting my mouth. The bathroom was disgusting. The price was decent .. happy hour prices. I wont be back. Major dissapointment."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of RA and this was my first visit to this location. I went with a friend and my daughter during happy hour so I expected it to be busy. When we arrived we gave our name to one hostess and she said they were cleaning a table so we should be seated shortly. About 5 mins later another party of 2 arrived and they gave our table to them so we ended up waiting another 10 mins for a table. We ordered and wanted our appetizer first but they ended up bringing our sushi first and our appetizer last!?? Our waiter was horrible obviously he wasn't hired for being a good waiter. He cared more about flirting with us and other guest. When it was time to pay we split the bill and he never brought back change. I tried getting his attention but he didn't care. I was to fed up to wait for my change. He definitely didn't deserve that $10 tip on a $35 bill. Beside the bad service the sushi was great which is why I give them 2 stars. They need to train the staff with better customer service."}
{"text":"Yum! We love RA and especially their happy hour, we come semi frequently. We got a few rolls and a couple drinks each and the food was great as well as the service. Cole was our server who was training a sweet blonde girl tonight 9/7 who was so pleasant greeting us and also helping Cole. I love going to restaurants that understand service is just as important as the food. We will for sure be back!! Great rolls and great priced drinks for happy hour. Rainbow roll is my FAV!"}
{"text":"So tonight I could not have been any happier with the service and experience. I was worried since they closed at 1am that showing up at 12 would be kind of rude so I called ahead of time and the lady I spoke with assured me that coming in around 12 would be okay. I picked my friend up from work and headed right over there to make sure we got there at least by 12. Staff was super friendly and our server was amazing and made my friend and I feel very comfortable. He was really funny and didn't make our visit awkward at all. (You know when you go out to eat and always get that awkward server) well not ours! I believe his name was \"Ali\". That's the name on my receipt. Such a great server and even though it's a 40 minute drive there, my friend and I both agreed we would be back there soon! Thanks Ali for making us feel welcomed! And thanks Ra for giving us such a delicious dinner."}
{"text":"We came here for the much touted Happy Hour. Pricing was OK. We ordered appetizers, a couple of rolls, and a couple of orders of Sushi.  The service was excellent! Our server was pretty attentive. 

The beef short ribs and shrimp tempura were pretty tasty.  The tempura and calamari rolls were good..............

The nigiri suishi was sliced pretty thinly.  I kind of expected to see a Japanese suishi chef at a Japanese restaurant.........not one in sight.  The chef didn't even know how to hold a suishi knife properly. I was kind of suprised to hear so much spanish spoken behind the suishi bar.  The suishi chef acted irritated whenever we ordered a dish. 

We ended the evening with a tempura cinnamon ice cream concotion. Tasty dish!

Its really loud here.........so if you are looking for a nice quiet evening, this is not he place to come to..............."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. Service was terrible. After getting served our unsweet tea, the waitress disappeared for 10 minutes. No sugar/sweet & low/splenda. Her excuse? We ordered unsweet tea, so she figured we would not want any sweetener. I explained that means I don't want it PRE-sweetened. Took our order, disappeared. Edamame was terrible. Salad & soup mediocre. Sushi sampler was not marked as spicy but somehow had wasabi hidden under each piece of fish. Meat was mediocre. Waitress disappeared again. 

When she came back, she said that her sister had her car with a dead battery and she had to leave, and the manager would take care of us. Nobody ever came by the table.

I wandered the restaurant to find someone to refill my tea. I showed the manager, she walked away. Waiting for the replacement sushi without wasabi took forever. I asked the manager how long does it take to make RAW FISH? No response. No apologies. No discount off the bill. 

When I asked for the bill, the waitress that supposedly had to leave to do something with her sister/car brought us the bill. Odd, thought she had to leave and could not take care of us with the same level of disservice that she had done so far.

Wasted $33 and over an hour and will not return. 

The reason the restaurant is quiet is that we saw very few people actually eating there. That should have been our first sign. Waiting for the waitress to order, we finally got up to leave and she happened to show up as we were heading towards the door. That was our 2nd sign, we should have kept walking. When we finally left after this bad experience, we saw other restaurants nearby that seemed to be full of people eating and enjoying themselves. Pick one of those and save your time and money."}
{"text":"For sushi no where near the ocean, it was pretty darn good. We went during happy hour,  I was very pleased with the variety and 'exclusive to ra' options. The drink menu was great, as well!"}
{"text":"Love the Sushi rolls, Ra Rockin Shrimp, and of course we hit up the reverse happy hour you can't beat the prices after 10pm."}
{"text":"Most recent trip here was disappointing. They did not have enough staff for weekend dinner rush. Half the restaurant was empty yet we had a 30 minute wait for a table. Sushi was average. Drinks and service were slow."}
{"text":"This place sucks ass.  Went there on Sunday night to watch game and eat sushi.  Place wasn't busy yet it took the hostess about 10 mins to acknowledge us.  I said we would like to sit at bar and watch game.  She pointed and said you have to go sit at outside bar.  Wtf?

We walk out, sit down and ignored again by staff.  After waiting for another 10 mins we walked across to pizza place and were actually treated like an appreciated customer.

Lost my business for good."}
{"text":"Whenever my girlfriends and I need to go to HH we always choose Ra. They have a BIG HH menu and it goes until 7 which is the latest Ive found. After dinner there is still time to shop around at the stores. It is a great spot and can get busy but they will take reservations which is a huge plus for organizing a successful Happy Hour. The food is always great and we never have to wait too long for our food."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group of around 20 people. RA sushi was very accommodating in finding us a table to fit everyone. 

We came for happy hour and the prices are pretty reasonable for the quality! Rolls were good and their vegetarian options were good as well. I was a big fan of the garlic edamame and wished I had ordered it for myself. 

The waiters did mix up some orders, but it was fine since they were serving such a large group. They even made sure to make our stuff come on time. Also, they split the check for us in 10 ways, which was really kind of them!"}
{"text":"I was a little worried to come here because of the reviews about the bad service. I sat at the bar by myself, and I have to say my order was taken quick and the food came out really fast. I had the garlic edemame which was really good, and I tried 2 specialty rolls: viva Las Vegas, and the 2 tuna rolls. The rolls were bland, the rice way too over cooked and with very little flavor. I am a sushi lover and tried Yuma 2 days ago here in Scottsdale (I'm on a business trip) and I have to say the food there is way fresher and tastier. 3 stars for this restaurant."}
{"text":"I only give this place a three because I only come here for the viva Las Vegas roll and nothing else. Amazing dish. Everything else on the menu is mediocre. The staff is decent. I've had a few good servers once or twice but a majority of them hate their lives it seems like. Not bad for drinks if you want a good happy hour. It's super dark in there though and the booth on the far back of the restaurant is destroyed and uncomfortable. They should replace that and make it at least acceptable to seat paying customers. The price isn't bad for happy hour. But nothing is really that great worth paying for."}
{"text":"I'm once again super disappointed with RA. I used to order weekly from this restaurant, but stopped because the quality and quantity has gone down hill tremendously. The last time I ordered take out, I called the manager after I opened the bag and looked at the to go boxes. I always get the RA chips and salsa and it is always a nice decent portion. That time it was significantly smaller. Now, I normally wouldn't call and complain, but the serving size I received was ridiculous. He said he would note my call and my complaint in the manager report and have someone contact me via email. That never happened. So, a few weeks have passed and I decided to give them another try tonight. I ordered what I usually do in hopes of the last time being a fluke. It was WORSE than the last time!! Literally 3 tablespoons of the tuna. I won't be going back which is a shame because I was regular. It shows that the management doesn't care."}
{"text":"We went as a group of four from the office. It took 25 minutes to get our soda and iced tea. 45 minutes after we arrived I had to get up and tell the server we only had an hour for lunch so we would need our order to go. He then came to the table and asked if we would like to just cancel the order. We told him we would rather just have it to go since we didn't have time to go anywhere else to get lunch.
The manager then came by and apologized and again asked if we would just like to cancel. Again we said we would just like it to go. I let my team head back to the office and I stayed to wait for the food. An hour and 15 minutes after walking in the manager came to me with our lunch bagged up. He apologized and said it was on the house.
I felt good at this point that at least they were making it OK. Then I got to the office and found that only three of us got our orders and none of the sides were in the bag. Needless to say a very poor experience all the way around."}
{"text":"So disappointed, I will tell you why.

1. Location. Loved Kierland location and now in a strip mall. 
2. Millennial as host   Asked if we could have a booth, was told they had two reserved.  So a family of four put at small table . Over the course of our meal six were still open. And I am so tired of hearing sorry guys. Stop calling me guy.
3. Menu -completely changed, portions are small, not sure why people come here. If you are a sushi foodie this is not your place. It used to be my place years ago but it has changed drastically.
4. Not friendly. They say hi, but don't stop and talk to me, I am human too. Waiter ok but was doing his job.  
5. Wasted space. They have a huge place where the sushi chef makes food, it would be a great space for food bar stools and TVs
6. Sushi grade is poor. My daughter gagged on her sushi roll.  My roll was not fresh. Seaweed is old.  It should melt in your mouth if fresh 

Sorry for the bad review. We moved to Seattle five years ago. We were back to visit family and friends this week. We used to eat there all the time. Such a letdown."}
{"text":"Their Viva Las Vegas Roll is always good, but the service always leaves you with a bittersweet taste. 
We don't plan on going back!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a sushi person but I love RA\"s happy hour. There are non-sushi items that I can order and be satisfied with.

The patio area with the high top tables are my favorite place to sit, especially since it's located in the mall, you can ''people watch'' while you eat!

My friend ordered the Las Vegas roll which was a Yelp favorite. I ordered the California Roll, Edamame & Chicken Kabobs. Their happy menu varies from $2 items to $7 items (still not bad for happy hour!)

The white sake sangria was my cocktail of choice and was SO DELISH. It was fruity, fresh and hit the spot.

Not problems with service.
This RA location is located in the Kierland Commons mall next to jCREW."}
{"text":"Great experience!  All their best dishes can be found on their Happy hour menu and it was very reasonably priced. I would recommend Las Vegas roll (unique tasty roll) and get their edamame with a bowl of their garlic spicy sauce to dip in. I used this sauce to dip other rolls in and asked for the recipe on the way out. Will go again!!!"}
{"text":"After being seated at a dirty table and being handed dirty menus and a grimy soy sauce bottle, I am so over this place with it's tired menu and hit or miss service. Time to find somewhere new."}
{"text":"Went for Saturday happy hour last night and left with a happy tummy! How can you beat sushi happy hour on Saturday until 7!! :)

*****  Large Kirin Light for $5 (always good :)
*****  Salmon Carpaccio (amazing and a great kick of wasabi)
*****  Sushi (all was fantastic...got salmon, tuna, and yellowtail)
*****  Pineapple Cream Cheese Won-Tons (yummy!!)
***     Viva Las Vegas Roll (Unique, but not for my taste)
**       Crispy Spicy Tuna (soo hard to chew! Rice was not crispy, just tough and chewy)"}
{"text":"In the past few months, RA Sushi bar moved from Kierland Commons a little south on Scottsdale BLVD and I was a little bummed.  I actually like the new location though!  Parking is more convenient, plus they are open until midnight which is sort of rare in the early closing city of Scottsdale.

Their staff is VERY professional and friendly.  My waitor had just started working there that week, but I could tell he was very well trained and had previous experience.  We did discover that we were very opposite in terms of political views, however, he was very respectful of my beliefs and I did the same.

They have gluten-free tamari sauce and organic rice as an option.  While this restaurant is typically outside of my uber-healthy restaurant options, the avocado roll and noodle soup works for me.  I sometimes go there to impress special dinner guests or sometimes I go there for my everyday \"work on my laptop\" nights.

If I had one complaint, it would be that the room is sometimes dark but my eyes adjusted after a few minutes and the music can be a bit loud, but often they will turn down the volume if I ask (yes, I'm getting to the age where the music is too loud).

This is definitely an upper-end sushi place and offers the same high quality that you would expect from other RA Sushi locations.  Check the website for Sunday Brunch and Happy Hour specials."}
{"text":"I've found another great sushi restaurant. This wonderful little restaurant offers a nice happy hour selection of some of the top shelf sushi items. Sitting outside on the patio at 7pm in the cool breeze of Scottsdale affords anyone the pleasure of simply relaxing at the end of the day. We ordered several including the Spicy Shrimp roll, Viva Las Vegas, and Zonie Roll. You can't go wrong with this place. Our waiter 'Dan' recommended a couple of drinks Blushing Geisha and the Dragon Bite. Even though this is a chain, the quality of drinks and food make this a unique stop in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Since the move from Kierland the overall quality and experience has completely gone down. I've tried the new location three times now with months between the second and third time. I went during lunch, was not busy, took 40 minutes for a California roll for goodness sakes. Ordered edamame to go and that took 20 minutes. Whatever happened to them during the move, this is a place I will no longer go to. I used to go once a week! They've got to get things figured out here!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, ~good service, cool atmosphere, loud hard surfaces (which seems to the trend) a little pricey.

Yeah, I would go back"}
{"text":"So. freakin. good.  Definitely hit up lunch hour you'll get the most bang for you buck! 
Sushi is fresh and delicious.. Couldn't ask for better!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi in Arizona! Not always the best service, but worth the drive for the food. Good happy hour deals and delicious desserts"}
{"text":"Stopped by today for some Sushi with my heterosexual life partner.

We were seated by the hostess quickly but waited ten or more minutes to be waited on.  The hostess noted we had not been servedand went to find a waiter.  There was a delay even after that point.

This did provide us with plenty of time to get our order of sushi.  When our waiter arrived he tried to leave after taking  the drink order.  I stopped him and had him take our sushi order before he wandered off again.

This level of service is what I would expect in Greece where literally I have had to chase waiters down to get a beer.

The sushi when it arrived was good.  We enjoyed the Las Vegas roll and the Gojira roll (GoJiiiirrrraaa!!!!) the most.

The fried banana desert was splendid.

Overall the quality of the food was shadowed by the at best indifferent service."}
{"text":"I just followed the recommendation from FourSquare which also offer a free Edamame as an appetizer, and I'm glad I did. They open late even weekdays, which is convenient for me who often end up with looking for a place to eat a dinner after 9pm.  A lot of healthy choices with reasonable price and decent volume. I will probably go back there when I go Phoenix again next time. But Sushi Nigiri from a la carte menu are pricy. I did not see any Asian Sushi Chef in the Sushi counter, which is not very common in the area I live (MD, DC, VA), but I suppose that is not unusual in Phoenix. Sushi quality was still pretty good."}
{"text":"I have family in Scottsdale and I think that I've eaten here literally every time I see them.  Last night was no exception, so off to Ra's happy hour we went.  They've recently changed their menu, so the happy hour offerings were different as well.  They have a few more drinks on special, but I went with the white sake sangria which is always a favorite.  Edamame was good per usual.  But, the new offerings are what blew us away.  The shisito peppers were probably my favorite part of the meal.  They were simple, but every bite was spicy and filled with garlic. Also new and garlicy, were the garlic sugar snap peas.  These were cooked well and very good.  The dengaku tofu is an old favorite.  I have to praise Ra for the amount of vegetarian dishes on their happy hour.  There were more options than we ended up ordering and that is extremely rare on most menus.

My only complaint with the new menu was the vegetable roll.  They seemed to have gotten rid of a standard veggie roll with cucumber, carrots, and avocado wrapped with nori.  The new roll is wrapped in rice paper and had artichoke hearts, and iceberg lettuce and a few other things mixed in.  I like that they tried to give it a new spin, but sometimes you really just want the classic."}
{"text":"Leaps and bounds ahead of every other sushi spot in the Phoenix area (especially Sushi 101) as far as taste goes. 

The atmosphere is always great, the service is generally quick, and the food is amazing.

I was a little put off by one of the sushi chefs preparing rolls with a band-aid on his ungloved hand. I realize that they have a license to prepare food without gloves, but having a bandaged hand preparing it was a little unsettling. If my food had been prepared by this sushi chef, I probably would have left 2 stars.

Other than that, the Las Vegas Roll and the Tootsy Maki are both absolutely delicious."}
{"text":"Ra is pretty good. It isn't as good as sushi brokers but it's good. We went at happy hour Saturday and they were out of a couple appetizers already...how is that possibly on a Saturday before dinner? I could understand late at night after a busy night, but 4p on a Saturday? Oh well. 
They also don't have fried rice? What's up with that? They have fried rice spring rolls but won't sell just fr. That's a normal app for an Asian place. It would be nice to see more meat appetizers as my friend I usually go with doesn't like seafood. We like going here because of the drinks and app specials. I like the sushi here, but they should have more variety for people like my friend who don't want to just eat sushi. 
The service was pretty good. It wasn't the best but it wasn't bad. 
Overall, I'll keep coming to Ra when they have happy hour since the normal prices are a bit high."}
{"text":"Dinner tonight.  Food was okay but wasn't anything too special, service wasn't great."}
{"text":"I could care less about being seen in Scottsdale, what my friends look like, and how cool we look when we hang out together. This is why I don't go to this place more than once every two years!!!! That being said, I do like their food. Its pretty good for sushi. But, the music is too loud, its pretentious as all get-out, the staff is too cool for their own good (Hey Bambi... You work in a frickin' restaurant), and its too much of a scene! Can I just have two of the Las Vegas' to go without all the crap?"}
{"text":"This is a cool sushi restaurant that serve good sushi.  I have had much better, but for a fun vibe with outside seating, it's not bad. 

I like the one in Kierland and would recommend checking it out.  It is not my favoriate sushi in AZ, but if I'm in a pinch, it will work.  

What I don't like is that the outside table will fill up for sport games on TV and the people continue to lurk and refuse to give up tables.  Granted, it's a game, but the sushi place is not a sports bar.  They should require the people to order so many drinks or some much food every hour to maintain the table... that's my only rant!

Enjoy."}
{"text":"This was the only real sushi place I tried while in AZ, and I was impressed, considering I believe MI has some tough places to beat! Lots of seating in the dining area, bar, and patio. Pretty lighting with the red sphere lanterns on the patio. Super friendly and welcoming staff and fast service. Loved that their ginger is fresh and not artificially colored pink. Here are items we ordered and loved:

Garlic edamame
Miso soup
Hot mess-appetizer (my fav, must try!!)
RA'ckin roll (bomb)
Crunchy shrimp tempura roll (loved it)
California dream roll (least favorite roll Bc of the fishy tasting snow crab salad mix that comes on top with the wonton chips)."}
{"text":"I headed to Ra for a happy hour with a couple of friends last week.  We sat outside and were quite comfortable, thanks to the well placed heaters.  Our server was nice enough, but not very engaging.  

We really enjoyed the pineapple cream cheese wontons - enough that we ordered a second serving!  The spicy salmon and Tootsy Maki rolls were delicious, but we weren't very impressed with the Vegas roll... it had an overwhelming strong mayo taste.  Otherwise, it would've been a very tasty roll though.

Not a bad happy hour spot, if you are looking for some cheaper sushi, but the drinks are still pretty pricey.   At the very end of our meal, our server brought over two drinks that she said they \"wanted us to try\" - nice, but there were three of us... one of us was supposed to just watch the others drink, I guess?  And unfortunately, the free drink was absolutely unpalatable - some kind of strawberry sake martini? Avoid it if at all possible.  Instead, the Mango Martini and the Shiso Naughty are much better options!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent and the food was even better. Our server Bryce took great care of our complicated order. We will be back"}
{"text":"Hmmm sushi in Scottsdale, Arizona...

The goods - there is usually little wait, the music is good, and the sunday specials rock my sox.  The staff is usually attentive and down to earth, and the food usually comes out pretty quick.  It is hard to find a good mojito in this darn town let alone anywhere, and they make a MEAN mango mojito.  The crazy monkey roll is my absolute favorite with a lot of flavor, but its definitely an acquired taste (if you are a nigiri lover, this is probably not the one for you).  They are open late night too which is great and hard to find in the n snottsdale area.

The bads - they are not always consistent with their fish.  Sometimes its great, other times it absolutely blows --- the nigiri is a toss up.  A seasoned sushi-er knows when something is not right; I put a piece of nigiri in my mouth that tasted way off, and what do you know it came right back up about 10 minutes later. Normally, I would swear to never return to a place that caused unnatural regurgitation, but the manager was quick to rectify the situation, covering our food on our bill and offering us a voucher for a free dinner of whatever we wanted next time we came back in [this however did not go as planned - check out my review on the ra downtown] Another time I found a bone in my salmon nigiri, definitely not ok.  The scene here too is simply obnoxious at certain hours, not as bad at this location though than others.  

Its worth a try, and I do still dine here, but your money is only worth it during the happy hour specials."}
{"text":"I love, love, love their Vegas Rolls. And now they are on happy hour menus!  Whoo hoo!
My girlfriends and I went recently for happy hour and we found a seat outside under the mists.  Food and drinks came out super fast, and service was great.  I love when a great sushi chain doesn't lose their service and quality of food."}
{"text":"I don't know what happened to this spot, atmosphere is still great, but I was there for lunch a few days ago, ordered vegas roll + spicy tuna & they were both terrible..literally my friend and I had maybe 1 or 2 rolls each..bland, no taste & stale..hard to find good sushi in this town these days.."}
{"text":"I went here with no great expectations only because iv'e heard that RA is chain and while being from SoCAl here on vacation, chain is not what I am looking for. The hostess, server (Derek) where amazing! unbelievably helpful from the moment we walked in! The food was great! SO great that we asked to talk to the manager (Nick) he was great also! gave us the 411 on the happening spots in the area.... most talk other places down he is very knowledgeable of the area. I will absolutely return here and highly recommend it! great atmosphere, staff and food, thanks everyone!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town ! Must try the pineapple  wontons as an appetizer and the maki split for desert. The maki split is an imitation of a sushi roll but as a fried banana topped with a kewi, strawberry, whip cream and drizzed with straw berry/chocolate syrup !!!! It's to die for !!!"}
{"text":"I don't know if it's Arizona or RA but the service here was exceptional. I've never seen anything like that - especially in NYC. 

First of all, garlic edamame? Who came up with that? Genius. 

They took a little long to get some sauces out to us so the manager came over, apologized and took some $$ off our bill. It was totally unnecessary but totally appreciated. 

Great food, fun space."}
{"text":"I have eaten hear over the years. Most of the time on Happy hour. The menu for happy hour always changes and seems to be decent. Good flavors, ok size. The reason why it only gets 2 stars in my book. Turn the fucking music down! The tech music they play sucks! It is hard to hold a conversation with that shit turned up to \"11\" If you can handle that then enjoy."}
{"text":"If I was able to give no stars I would I come here constantly with my boyfriend and eat normally 30 minutes to an hr before they close and we were turned away this evening 35 minutes before closing and told they weren't taking any food orders."}
{"text":"RA is always fast and easy and open at odd hours when you're craving sushi so that's always a plus. The outdoor seating in the Tempe RA is nice. The service and the RA on Scottsdale road is so bad that it's funny. You order a drink and it comes out with your last course. It's happened every time I go. The servers are always so sweet but they have no idea how to serve in a decent time frame. The food is always okay."}
{"text":"Slow Service. 

This has been our family's favorite restaurant but over our last three visits we have become so frustrated with the predictably slow service that we won't return.  We wanted to give it one last chance, but last night was our last visit.  

The food was great as always, but the service is so slow you feel as though your business is being taken for granted.   We ordered cocktails first, which took ages to arrive.  Our starter arrived in a reasonable amount of time, but no soy sauce.  The server did not return and to our amazement there was not soy sauce on any of the outdoor tables, so we had to walk into the main restaurant to ask for it.   

Nobody else ordered a second drink or desert as we were now sitting so long we were physically uncomfortable and just wanted to be out of there.  Waiting for the check was another unreasonably long process.  

Unfortunately, poor service has become the standard at this location and with so many other choices in the area we will not return."}
{"text":"We went to the new location and love the bar and better location.  Was seated and no one helped us.  My son asked someone walking by, if they could get our waiter.  He apologized and said it was not his area but would take care of us!  Isidro was fantastic and made sure we were taken care of!!

Food was great!  We will be back.."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience...

Have been to Ra Sushi a number of times over the years and have had an overall positive view of the restaurant as a whole. Although, after my recent visit to this particular Ra Sushi location I am entirely done with them. 

Was in the area and saw the restaurant from the street and decided to drop in. I was by myself so decided to sit at the bar. First, it took a while for me to be greeted... From the get go the bartender (Jennifer) wasn't warm, friendly, nor accommodating. The initial interaction with the bartender would hold true for my entire experience. 

After being greeted I put in my drink order. The drink did not take long and was actually made very well. The issue was the horrendous customer service. I was three sips into my drink and the bartender (JENNIFER) brought me my tab.... Mind you, this was around 8:00 PM on a weekday... no close coming around the corner nor did I indicate I was there for just one quick drink. This coupled with the fact that she had an overall rude attitude towards me was upsetting. No customer ever wants to feel rushed. 

While at the bar I was never checked up on one time. No, \"how's the drink...\" \"Here is your bill. No rush sir.\" \"Would you like anything else?\" \"Thanks for coming in\" ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. I was also never asked if I wanted a menu. I received dirty looks to boot??? 

I typically like to stay on topic and never reference other reviews as a 3rd party... Although, one needs only read through this restaurants review to see they have a major issue with service that they have obviously yet to properly address. 

I will not be spending my hard earner money with this business again. If you value good customer service and professionalism I recommend you stay away from Ra Sushi. 

Disappointed."}
{"text":"I only gave this 3 stars because of the taste of the food.  RA always has a great selection.  This was the first time going to this particular location.  We were very disappointed.  Our waiter took more than 4 minutes to even come to our table and greet us and take our drink orders. Just a little information before I go on....this was at 3pm on a Saturday and they were not busy AT ALL.  He finally gets our drink order (sodas) and it takes him a while to deliver them.  We place our food order, several minutes later we get our food but never received our soups as our appetizer.  That got corrected after bringing it up to our server.  Now all our drinks were empty and needed refilled.  We had to flag him down and ask for refills, he had his hands full so would be \"right back\".  He didn't come back, we had to again track him down to get more soda.  While we were waiting I went to the restroom, it was gross, papertowels overflowing and trash on the floor.  The restaurant itself looked a lot like this also.  There were wrappers and debri all over the dining area.  You would think being in North Scottsdale Keirland things would look nicer.  We will be sticking to the south scottsdale location where we know we get great service and the place is clean!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for Arizona Restaurant Week. 

We've never been to RA Sushi before, so we figured we'd check it out. 

This is at the Kierland Commons location in North Scottsdale. We walked in and I thought it looked really cool inside. I liked the atmosphere and thought the red lights were a good touch.

Our waitress was nice, but really didn't understand the AZ Restaurant Week menu. She gave us conflicting information about it. It had been going on for at least a week but she said we were her first customers to order off that menu. Maybe she should have been trained in it better. Whatever, not a HUGE deal.

We got the pot stickers for the appetizer. It was good. No complaints there. But it reminded me of the pot stickers you sample at Costco. I wonder if they got it from there. 

We ordered the Las Vegas roll and some other sushi assorted platter. The Vegas rolls were way too messy. I didn't know how to eat it with my chop sticks. Kubuki is better. The California rolls were super tiny too. I had no clue what the other thing was. I think it was salmon on top of white rice? Not impressive.

Then came desert. We got the green tea ice cream. I couldn't finish it because it tasted too bitter. My wife informed me that it wasn't bitter, but I thought it was. Maybe my pallete is off? 

Anyway, it was overpriced. Our server was nice, but she didn't really go above and beyond. Would I come back? Probably not."}
{"text":"In regards to Laura w , Danielle is the best bartender at RA. Come Into RA on a weekly basis and make sure Danielle is always working before I go in. She is always extremely attentive, sweet and knowledgable."}
{"text":"Really, Ra? 12??!  That's TWELVE open tables on the patio at 5pm on a Saturday and you can't seat a table for two because they're ALL reserved?!? We would probably only take up a table for 45mins max as we had to get a babysitter to get out for this evening. 

Surprise! Still tables open when we left!"}
{"text":"I like the happy hour menu, location and the service. Jayme was really helpful explaining items and attentive during our meal. The food came out perfect. This is a reliable fun delicious dining experience. I recommend it."}
{"text":"Server was awesome! Food was fast and delish. Beer was cold. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Been eating here since 2004! With sooooo many sushi bars opening on every corner, this RA still holds great quality fish and has an awesome staff! It's my go to happy hour if on sushi mode! Amazing food and drinks and staff!

Ps In oct. Kierland location moves to Scottsdale and thunderbird shopping center location! Can see it from Scottsdale road!"}
{"text":"This place was always great. The atmosphere is energetic and the prices are very reasonable! Sometimes the service lags when they get super busy but the management really makes things right, should there ever be a problem. Sitting at the sushi bar is always a great experience too! Especially if it's a busy night; there's usually a seat opening up there pretty quickly!"}
{"text":"First time dining here. Food was good, service was great. Definitely would come back."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had a reservation and we were seated right away.  Nice atmosphere and the server was friendly and was really familiar with the menu.  Food was very good and drinks were great!   Service- not so great.   Appetizer came out before our drinks then my daughters plate came 10 minutes before mine.  The manager comped my meal.  When paying the tab, server came back to the table without my change!

Needs improvement in service for sure!"}
{"text":"Only complaint is the wait time for a table outside in this beautiful weather. Otherwise this place succeeds everytime!"}
{"text":"Ra has been a longtime favorite of ours. Thursday night was a huge disappointment. The atmosphere is horrible at the kier land location. Music was so loud we had to yell at each other in the booth. We asked the waiter Dustin if it could be turned down a little, he laughed and said the manager will turn it up, and they did! The manager was lance. Also, they changed the happy hour menu which is really surprising since it has been a valley favorite for years. I may not be back."}
{"text":"Not the best sushi in the world but I appreciate the value of their lunch specials as well as the charm, panache and mystique of the bartenders. 

Tip - They also make a fantastic squid salad."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to Ra Sushi for the last year.  We had not been in awhile and decided to take advantage of the happy hour before the big Saturday night rush. 

Although the happy hour menu looks like it has been expanded, the quality of food has clearly diminished.  Our sushi roll (spicy yellowtail) looked like it was rolled by a 3rd grader.  Additionally, it was barely filled with any fish!  I can't believe that a reputable restaurant could serve something that looked so puny.  

We will not be returning in the near future."}
{"text":"By far this is their best location as I have frequented all their establishments. You will never be short of good energy, consistently good food and really good service. Bravo to my server last night for her finesse in managing the patio area with always a sweet smile and thoughtful apologies for being not as attentive as she would like. The back up bussers are always spot on to clear the evidence of my gorging. Thank you for letting me look dainty!

This is my fave HH location. Great people watching. We all know their lunch specials are the bomb, especially the bento boxes. My faves that aren't on HH are the lobster spring rolls and the Gojira roll. Otherwise, stuff yourselves on the Vegas roll, the garlic citrus yellowtail and the rainbow roll. Perfect flavors to compliment the potstickers and your Sapporo beer!"}
{"text":"Love this place! We came here after seeing a late movie and the reverse happy hour is amazing!!! The service was wonderful & food was fresh and amazing even at 10pm!"}
{"text":"RA Sushi is a fun place to go and it has a great Happy Hour!

We came here yesterday on Father's Day for brunch and were seated very quickly. I am not a big fan of the Americanize sushi craze. I was brought up on the old school counter seats and conveyor belt setup, with different colored plates. But, RAs does a nice job and has a well deserved reputation for good sushi and as an after work watering hole.  

We started with Edamame, which was very flavorful.  Our waiter was eager to help, offering to tell us everything he knew about the menu and sushi.  Over the top for sure, but very nice just the same.

The sushi portions are the Americanized thick cut with an exaggerated piece of fish that hangs over the rice on either side. I was less impressed by California Rolls which are made with a crab salad, rather than strips of crab.  It also had a fishy taste. If you are sushi purist, you might not enjoy it. 

We skipped their famous Sake Bombers, since it was before Noon. But we had a very nice Father's Day and enjoyed the atmosphere of RA's.  Our bill came to a reasonable $19.00 per person, including taxes and gratuities. So, Three Stars \"A-OK' in Yelp-ese."}
{"text":"Had lunch with the fam here and we were all super pleased with most everything! We had a seaweed salad, vegas roll(*best!), spicy tuna roll and split two lunch specials. Ma got pork katsu bento box and it finally came out as sis and I were finishing the bowl that I had ordered full of raw fish. We were a bit scared at first, but the shrimp, tuna, yellowtail and salmon were in perfect bite sized pieces over rice and accompanied by tasty vegetables. It was a winner even to sis who claims to hate salmon. The pork was a letdown, but saved by the salad's it was served over and next to. Ixnay the pork and everything was perfecto!"}
{"text":"Slowest service ever. It's a bad sign when the table that was seated after us gets their meal before we even get our drinks. Took 10 minutes before our server came to greet us. She hardly came by and we had to flag her down to put in another order which took 25 minutes for 1 roll of sushi to be delivered. At the same time, we also asked for our bill  because we had already been there for an hour (2 rolls and an entree of noodles) and figured we'd get our bill before we lose her again. It took another 20 minutes between getting the bill and her swiping our card. What was supposed to be a nice evening out turned into an hour and a half of the slowest, most inattentive service I've had in quite some time. We've been here once before and had great service and sushi so it was unfortunate my experience last night was subpar."}
{"text":"I Love RA!!  I usually go there for lunch.  They have a great lunch menu with bento boxes, bowls, and sushi or sashimi combos.  I also LOVE the veggie tempura!  They also have a great happy hour menu and pricing.  I come here as often as I can."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and never considered it an exceptionally amazing but loved the happy hour and their crazy monkey roll. Well I decided to come here just for that last weekend. It was not busy at all which is very strange as it was prime time on a weekend night and we were seated outside. Let me bottom line it: the food has completely gone downhill and the service is TERRIBLE. Our waiter was nice but seemed kind of new because he would rarely come around to check on us... like 20 minute intervals at least. My husband didn't like his iced green tea so he asked he send it back, he forgot my husband's replacement drink order until we asked again for it. He said he \"comped\" us for the iced green tea even though we drank hardly any of it and asked for it to be sent back. He never brought us water, I had to walk inside and ask the bartender for water. He forgot the soy sauce and ramekins for our sushi, so my husband had to walk inside and ask for this as well. We're not particularly picky people but when we get a night out we expect basic service. 

Now on to the food, I used to LOVE the crazy monkey rolls. I mean I craved them so much it's the reason I went there last weekend. To my disappointment, it was sloppily put together and there was more cream cheese in there than anything. It actually did not even taste good.

Long story short, due to the terrible service and decreasing quality of their food we will not be returning unless it only for happy hour drinks or something. There are far better sushi places in the area with comparable prices, Sakana is amazing for example."}
{"text":"To say we were utterly disappointed with our service experience this evening would be an understatement.  Tonight was our 4th dinner this week with Ra supporting Nicky's Week and the work of St. Jude Children's Hospital.

From the moment our server Dan walked up to our table with a black eye, to his rubbing his eyes while he was taking our order began this unfortunate experience with his equally blase attitude.  Dan proceeded through our dinner service to walk to the end of the bar and lift his shirt to show off his stomach, which he was apparently impressed with, to one of his co-workers.

Empty water glasses, empty ice tea and having to flag him down to ask for the check was simply the icing on the cake.  This was all under the less than watchful eye of what we had to assume was a male manager who was equally disheveled in his appearance.  We can only surmise he was a manager based on hearing him apologize to the table behind us for their dissatisfaction.  When we left the restaurant \"the manager\" was comfortably seated at the end of the bar doing absolutely nothing.  

We left a shockingly low tip that hopefully conveyed our displeasure to Dan and left the remainder as an increased donation to the memory of Nicky and the great work of St Jude.  Over the years we have certainly come to expect much more from a service standpoint than your Kierland team offered this evening.  We will not be back to this location in the near future."}
{"text":"Sushi is not that good to be having such terrible service. 

After showing up at the wrong location to just be told \"this happens all the time\" instead of just taking us at that location we were told we HAD to drive 22 minutes to the other location to keep our reservation. You would think since this happened all the time they had some sort of procedure in place but no.  

So after driving to the other location we were seated quickly (I called and told them what happened so they knew we were going to be late) but sat without being greeted or offered water for so long that we might as well have just not been seated yet. 

When we finally were approached by our server (Jayme) she stopped by the table next to us and began a full conversation while placing napkins on our table without saying a word to us but still talking to the table next to us. Not to mention after she finishes her conversation offers no apology or explanation for her terrible greeting. It was downhill from there. After taking another 10 minutes to retrieve a drink menu, we saw her a total of four times with the worst fake happy attitude it actually made us uncomfortable.

At the end of the day there are way better places in Scottsdale to get Sushi with WAY better service, so why go to RA."}
{"text":"Went there at what I thought was late for the area, 10pm, but little did I know the party was just getting started. Sat at the bar. Ordered their late night HH yellowtail nigiri (2 pieces) and seared tuna. Yellowtail was so good I ordered a second round. Danielle the bartender (how could I forget her name with some unexpected drunk guys coming in and shouting her name every couple of minutes) was really welcoming. By the time I left the bar had been half full and a table of 8+ was being served. I'm not staying long in the area but very tempted to come back again!

p.s. They automatically served ginger/wasabi with the meal, so I'm not sure what a previous reviewer was complaining about."}
{"text":"Visit this place almost weekly. Frequently enjoy happy hour with and crispy spicy tuna roll and chili ponzu yellowtail. Always reasonably priced and is good quality sushi. Have bad better have had worse but it's very good for the price."}
{"text":"Love RA.... This RA is small & has a cramped feeling to me compared to Chandler .. Love sake sangria... The sushi .. All good:-)"}
{"text":"Friendly and attentive staff...efficient service, fresh fish, diligent preparation practices, good prices (take some time on the $25 menu or happy hour listing) and convenient location... enjoy!"}
{"text":"Pretty bad experience....I was here with 4 friends and I guess the bartender had an issue with my girlfriend but I have been a bartender for 11 years and no matter what you must leave that at the door and as a fellow worker in the quarter you should want me to give raving reviews. I can't....the man bartending was amazing he made the experience but the girl her name was Danielle she wade a point to speak to the manager who personally came over and had the audacity to ask if my date had been kicked out of r.a. which she had not....and as a professional I find this to just be vile....how dare you ruin our celebration for a personal vendetta and how dare you support it... I have been a longtime guest and I will never patronize this place again...sorry ra....but you deserve and could be better"}
{"text":"Got here about 11 pm , and lucky me it was happy hour  . Music was good , only one bartender at that time and didn't see a server , on other words, it looks like it doesn't get that much business at that time (happy hour for a reason) , bartender was friendly , took care of us , food was delicious .. I recommend the Ra-ckin shrimp .. That was just tasty . I thought I was going to get very small portions because of the happy hour deal , but I was wrong . I did dislike the lighting (just a personal oohing) too dimmed for me . 
Small bar , they do have a nice patio though . I'll have to come back in the day to see how the experience is ."}
{"text":"Ok rolls. Good but not too memorable drinks. Recommend it for the happy hour."}
{"text":"Came in Friday Night and was greeted warmly by like 3 hostesses at the door. Our server was super sweet and attentive... almost too attentive. We ordered the edamame, rainbow roll, tootsy roll and tuna roll. Everything was perfect and tasted fresh!! My sangria was a little bland but overall it was definitely a 5 star experience"}
{"text":"LOVE THE NEW LOCATION AND THE PATIO IS AWESOME! The bar is spectacular!!!! Food seems to taste even better!!!!!! The staff and manager are awesome! Way better atmosphere than Snotty Sapporo!"}
{"text":"Very pleasant experience here!  The food was outstanding, and our waitress was quite attentive and patient when we weren't ready to order...even after 20 minutes.  Great Happy Hour menu as well."}
{"text":"I wish I could give it 3.5 stars. This place has a great atmosphere. Good value (during happy hour especially). The edamame was over cooked tonight but usually is spot on. Wed they have a deal where you choose 4 small plates plus an order of edamame for $30. Also have happy hour menu and drink specials until 7 every night (I think all day Sun as well). The chili ponzu yellowtail is always amazing. Service always good. Solid sushi meal always."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why they change there location but the old one was fine 
This place is empty and not very fun 
The stuff move super slow even if there is no ppl there 
I love the sushi here because it's fresh and taste good
My problem is that I never get what I order 
It's always the second time I ask it 
And they are cheap on there spicy mayo 
If you go there that fine just keep it simple for them ,if not you will get something else"}
{"text":"I went with my girlfriend and I ordered the spicy mitso soup and she ordered the potsticker soup, and we shared some endamame.  Both soups were big portions and absolutely fantastic.  Was told by the GF that the spciy mitso was similar to something she had in Japan.  

The other great thing was their happy hours:  10 to midnight.  So while surrounding restaurants are cleaning their kitchens to close for the night, this place is just getting started.

Now for the bad:  we never got around to ordering a main, because of the ghetto Muzak that was being piped onto the outdoor patio area, inside, even in the bathrooms you could not get away.  Are these people serious?  Nothing like hearing the lyrics \"you gotta lick it, before you stick it, you gotta get it soft and wet so we can kick it\" (yes, that song from a previous decade is now in a cheesy extended club mix version playing exclusively at Sushi RA)....how nice it is to hear such words as you contemplate which raw fish to order.  I don't think so.  I looked around but did not see a dance floor...although I did notice a couple behind us with 2 young girls which made the whole scene seem entirely inappropriate.  I thought for certain they must be offended, but realized much later, during a short break in the music, that they were speaking French and seemed entirely oblivious to the lyrics being pounded out.

The management of this place need to mature a little bit.  I have been to places like this in Manhattan, where they think they can survive on great food and reputation forever, and that people will tolerate any attitude and disrespect for the sake of it.  

The bottom line: this establishment serves 5 star food while pandering to 1 star clientele.  I was surprised to hear they have been around for 8 years....."}
{"text":"So over rated. 
I'm from San Francisco- I have high standards for my sushi. 
I especially dislike sub-par fish in a place that tries to look/act swanky. 
This reminds me of a sleazy date spot- oh wait it is!

I prefer my secret spot in Avondale for better prices, fresher fish, and more attentive staff."}
{"text":"Okay so before everyone gets all JUDGEY about the impossibly high rating I gave a sushi restaurant in Arizona that's part of a chain owned by Benihana (THE HORROR!), hear me out.  My office is located in the Kierland Commons. This can be nice when I want to blow half my paycheck at H&M during my lunch break, but it's not so nice when I NEED to blow half my paycheck if I want to be able to go somewhere walking distance from my office for lunch. Originally, I thought my most reasonable options were a $7 Asian Chicken Salad at Chloe's Corner or crossing Scottsdale Rd to get to Chipotle. That is, until I ventured over to RA today and saw what I had been missing.

For starters, they have some amazing lunch specials.  Yes, they are pricier than Chipotle but in the grand scheme of sushi, they're pretty damn good. They have a Sashimi Lunch combo that is four pieces of salmon, tuna, and yellowtail with a miso soup and a salad for like $12.  Their Bento lunches come with so many things I can't even remember them all and cost like $9.  For the area (this mall in particular), these lunch prices are incredibly reasonable.

What I got today, the Tuna Squared Salad, isn't even on the lunch menu and it totally blew my mind that for a couple bucks more than the tuna-mayo salad over greens I get at Chloe's (which is delicious BTW but that's not the point), I could be getting a huge portion of greens topped with about 5-6 pieces of seared ahi, about 5-6 slices seared sushi-grade albacore, avocado, and cashews.  These are all very expensive things!  This should be a very expensive salad! But it's $10 and it's glorious.

Oh one more thing that I probably won't be getting while we're in the triple digits but I have had before and it's delightful: Miso Hot Soup.  Picture a huge miso soup full of shrimp and tofu and mushrooms with with a kick strong enough to clear your sinuses.  Plus it comes with these fried rice balls (I usually get it to go and they come on the side) that are surprisingly delicious. I always think I can save some calories and not eat them, but it never happens. Those suckers are in the soup by the second spoonful and gone before I'm half done, they're just that good.

All in all, no, I don't go to RA for mind-blowingly fresh, melt-in-your-mouth sushi. But I do go for decent lunch options at prices that allow me to blow money during my lunch break the way God intended: Shopping."}
{"text":"I'm really impressed with this place.  I think some people may give it bad marks because it's sums up everything beautiful and wrong with Scottsdale in one meal.  The location in Keirland, lends RA to be a haven for the Scottsdale douche elite to hang out at the chain sushi restaurant with mexican chefs, order a dynamite roll and reminisce about the time they ate the freshest yellow fin at the Grand Wailea resort on Maui.    And I got to say, I saw a couple of them there.  But sushi is a funny thing.  You can't fake freshness no matter how hard you try, and the fish here tastes like it was flown in from Japan, Alaska, or Hawaii this morning.  Blows places like Yume out of the water.  My wife and I wondered in on a Saturday afternoon and to our delight happy hour was in effect.  Long story short, we ordered a lot of nigiri, ponzu marinated sashimi, a couple of hand rolls, gyoza, and 4 beers for a total of $64 including tip.  I'd definitely come here during non happy hour, but I have to say, this is going to be my new place for Saturday afternoon indulgences.  You see, like the mexican sushi chefs that work here, Scottsdale is a bit of an anomaly.  There's no real culture here other than the one that's been put up by developers.  All the authentic real grit that resides in the Downtown Phoenix, has been washed away, polished up, and desert that used to be considered no mans land nothing is now the height of luxury in the Valley and its only getting better with time.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that beyond the Pottery Barns and the overpriced Hemingway Cigar Shop bullshit, there are local businesses that have adapted and learned like the chefs at RA and they are turning out spectacular food and doing it really well.  Don't let any other reviews change your mind.  Come down to Kierland on a hot day, sit at the RA Sushi Bar, order a cold beer, a couple pieces of maguro, and suck up all the Scottsdale ambiance you can muster.  Douche bags included."}
{"text":"This is my go to sushi place for my husband and I. The sushi is great and the servers are always wonderful! They always make sure we are happy and our water glasses are full! Great service and food!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in town. I usually don't like that fishy stuff but hell.... I'll take it! Plus there drinks are always mixed on the heavy side."}
{"text":"The good:

Happy Hour! Great quiet location(not directly next to a busy street), beautiful woman left and right, great club like atmosphere. If you want to have a night out at a \"cool\" place with friends Ra is it.

The bad:

For the money not the best sushi. But for happy hour you can't beat the deal and this becomes a great value. You will get a great experience. Also it can be packed over the weekend so get there by 5 P.M to catch the happy hour."}
{"text":"They changed there happy hour menu and took a lot off of it. I ordered the tootsie rolls and they were not made the way they used to be. I'm disappointed :("}
{"text":"The service was SOOO bad here. I don't think I've ever given a restaurant two stars but I mean, come on. We made a reservation for Saturday night and our waiter literally forgot about us after we finished eating and tried to flag him down so many times and he kept ignoring us so we finally had to ask the hostess to get us our check, which she did do and he never came back to check on us. We had all of our dishes and plates just left on the table for whole time so we were staring at them and finally had to stack them at home. Maybe he was the only one working in our area that night? Who knows but you'd think they would staff correctly on a Saturday night or at least have him apologize at the end of the meal but he wasn't even around to do so.

It's super upsetting because it's not like this place is cheap. I don't foresee myself coming back here in the future because the hospitality was just plain bad."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant, loved everything- the vibe , the music, the atmosphere, and, of course, food !! Ordered chirashi bowl and gyoza, very fresh and delicious. Unfortunately don't live in the area , otherwise would've definitely become a regular with such an extensive menu and great service ."}
{"text":"PATHETIC!!!
Went to this so called \"sushi\" place and we sat at the bar for 15 minutes before taking a drink order. Took another 10 to get it. Mind you, this place was not busy.
Ordered a calamari roll and spicy salmon roll which again took 20 minutes to receive without any ginger or wasabi.
The calamari was fair at best but the salmon was \"off\" and I mean it was very warm which is the last thing you want in raw fish. 
The bartender asked \"how was it?\" which I informed him the salmon wasn't right and he replied \"would you like something else?\" And at his point I said \" no thank you, just the check\". It didn't make sense to wait Another 20 min for sushi that's is mediocre at its best.
Bill arrives....still charged me for the salmon roll.
So I paid it, and went up to the manager and told him the situation, who must be 25 years old max, and he replied \"Oh\".  Huh??? That's your response, that's your customer satisfaction?? Wow!
I'm not surprised, this place is run by children throughout the entire restaurant.
Weak!!"}
{"text":"Lots of awesome roll options for me and husband enjoyed his sushi. Bento box is a great option to try couple different dishes. Awesome patio to sit outside and enjoy food and beautiful weather."}
{"text":"We love this place for date night.  They have plenty of Vegan options such as cucumber roll, avocado roll, veggie tempura roll and the garlic edamame.

The staff is so fun and friendly!  Ask for Nate, he's entertaining and attentive! We always leave full and happy!"}
{"text":"Poor service - Dirty tables and they waited until after my order was in for 20 minutes to tell me they didn't have the item I ordered. I have to request a menu to order something else and then they told me there would be a wait because their kitchen was backed up. The food I did order was not very good, very inconsistent."}
{"text":"I had been a regular here and placed fairly decent sized take out orders weekly. The food is always good although they don't always get substitutions right. Since substitutions are sometimes about allergies that isn't super. 
Anyway, I had not been here in a few months because I got really tired of how terrible the young girls taking the orders over the phones were. I decided I would give it another chance and called tonight around 4:30 to place a take out order. I gave Whitney my name and was about to place my order when I was asked if I could hold. 5 minutes later I was still holding and I hung up. 
Management, train your employees on customer service. I doubt I am the only business you are losing!  
It's really sad too when you love a restaurants sushi but the employees can't take a take out order and treat customers properly at off hours. 
Guess next time I'm craving RA I will be driving to old town. Hopefully they are managed better and value their customers their. 
Bye bye Kierland. Too many fails for the least acceptable reason."}
{"text":"I have to say I was a bit nervous going to RA...I hadn't been in quite some time and was afraid it had declined like Stingray (which was a favorite years ago). 
Happy News!! RA is Amazing as I recalled from past years visiting the Old Town Scottsdale location!!! The atmosphere is consistent to the chain...with illuminated red balls bouncing around the ceiling! The service was spot on...welcoming immediately upon arrival, helpful with menu suggestions and able to handle a large group in a great way!! Brice and Kali were Fantastic!! Keeping glasses full and plates of goodies coming!! The presentation of the goodies was spot on and Beautifully crafted! Fresh and delicious....the photos will have you coming in! The service will encourage you to return!! Thanks RA!!"}
{"text":"Not my fav place prob like #7 on my list however a great lunch spot late in the afternoon its usaully empty. I like there lettuce wrap thing o and they have alcohol there too after being in Barnes & Noble for hours I get hungry and thirsty what can I say!?!? The one in awhatukee bluuuu 100x worse food wise but thats another review =)"}
{"text":"Kowasaki made amazing sushi for us at the sushi bar, and our server, Adriana, was really attentive and so genuinely friendly! 

The sake salmon sashimi is sublime and the ra'llipop roll is one if my favorite types if rolls: no rice and tons of delicious fish!

Overall, a terrific experience, plus excellent happy hour. This place just made it into our regular rotation!"}
{"text":"I have been to RA a couple of times at different locations. My main thought is that it is WAAAAAAAY overpriced. $10 for a well martini? REALLY?? One trip, I got 2 drinks, peppers, and one or two sushi rolls (which are relatively small), and I paid $60!! Yes...60 bucks for ONE person to not even get full! I then heard from a friend that happy hour is the best time to go...prices on happy hour items are a bit more reasonable. So...I went to the late night (10-close) happy hour last weekend.

We walked up and saw a few tables of people outside, and inside there were no more than a handful more...good, not too busy. There was one other woman waiting at the host stand so we stood behind her. We stood there...and stood there...and stood there. 

Several times employees walked by; one even gave a polite little head nod which verified that none of us were invisible. However, even after several times of poking our heads around the dining area and toward the bar tender, no host ever came. We even walked around the fish tank at the entrance thinking maybe someone would come over out of concern that we were essentially BEHIND the host table. Nope! 

After at least 10 minutes of being completely ignored we finally gave up and left. That other woman stayed. That was about a week ago. She very well may still be waiting there. We went to a different restaurant where we paid much less than we would have at RA (even at happy hour prices) and where we were served very quickly.

I have had it with RA. Food is expensive and the taste/quality is mediocre...more presentation than substance. They use tricks to make the food appear larger than it is...spreading out the pieces of sushi roll, garnishing with sauces and some items to make the dish appear taller. It looks nice of course, but when you're hungry, the aesthetics don't fill you up! Happy hour was my last attempt at allowing them to win me as a customer...and I never made it past the entrance."}
{"text":"Tuna tataki it's where it's at. 

Ra does a good job with it's Sashimi dishes, but comes up short with it's rolls. The six that my group ordered all derived from Califormia rolls which are safe and boring. 

I ordered:

Tropical Roll with, \" Cucumber, mango & avocado rolled & topped with spinach tempura bits, spicy shrimp mixed with masago & mango salsa,\" Unfortunately the mix was so cold that it was flavorless. I tried to let it sit until last, and ate my other food, but it wasn't good. I ended up leaving it on the table. 

The Ultimate Shrimp Tempura: with, \" Spicy kani kama crab mix, cucumber & shrimp tempura rolled & topped with seared tuna & avocado.\" It tasted like a california with avocado and resembled a rainbow roll. There was little flavor from the shrimp tempura,as the boring crab mix took up most of the roll

Tuna Tataki: \"Thinly sliced, seared ahi tuna; served with an onion soy vinaigrette\" This happens to be my favorite item on the menu, and is the reason I keep coming back to Ra. The sauce is perfect with the tuna, and it's sliced perfectly. Everything about this dish is perfection.

Overall, RA is a nice place to sit back and relax, but the menu is boring except for a few items. At the table there were 7 items overall, but only one warranted a second bite."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend Shannon I hadn't seen in forever, we grabbed lunch on a beautiful cool sunny day.  Which meant the entire restaurant was sitting outside so we opted to be 1 of 3 groups that sat inside and had the place to ourselves pretty much.

The waitress was pretty nice and pretty patient with us because we spent so much time chit chatting and catching up that she had to return at least 5 times before we were actually ready to order.  My friend picked the place and I decided to give it a try cause I figured a different location might be better but the food was still just okay and the apple martinis were still very very strong.  So strong that she and I had to do some more window shopping for another hour to make sure I was good enough to drive after just one drink which is insane.

The place was very clean, I give them credit for that, but I personally feel for how bland the food was it's too overpriced.  But I'm guessing it's just me because I have many friends that can't stay away from here and love going back for more and more and more."}
{"text":"Very popular sushi bar in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale. Good sushi for Arizona. I had to send a happy hour alcoholic beverage back to the bar for some fixing. Weekend evenings are very busy, can be loud inside and nearby parking space is usually difficult to find, so if possible, car pool."}
{"text":"This place is great! Awesome sushi to choose from and amazing service!! I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We moved into the area from South Scottsdale in the past 3 months and noticed the new location for this RA. I decided to stop in on a Friday afternoon for a late lunch and to check it out. I sat up at the bar and since I went later than the normal lunch time (2pm) it was pretty quite. I ordered a bottle of saki  and the assorted sashimi lunch special and a spicy tuna handroll. The bartender was very personable and service was great. My girlfriend decided to come meet me last minute so I placed her a lunch order before they stopped serving lunch at 3pm and we sat and had a few more drinks. It was nice to see the place fill up by the time we left at 5:30. Everyone was great  and so was the service. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this RA. Great sushi and love the happy our saki bombs and sushi.
Saki bombs always start off the night right."}
{"text":"I like this place... the simple fact they restaurant is open until midnight but the bar is open until 1am on a weekdays, I'm up for another round of sushi at 11 PM."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of the Ra Sushi happy hour for some time, and this branch is similar to the ones that I usually go to in Southern California.  The sushi is very reasonable and tasty, and the drinks are cheap.  My favorite happy items include the Calamari Tempura and the Las Vegas Roll."}
{"text":"Place is avg.  Sushi was good but the red sangria saki was bad. Service was sporadic and we had a one plate that they forgot to put the sauce on, and another couple plates they tried to give us which we did not order.   I would try to find another place."}
{"text":"Very good sushi.  As does it's companion in Old Town.  Set in Kierland, very nice atmosphere.  Very predictable menu, no suprises.  Good quality, slightly overpriced, but a great place for a date."}
{"text":"So as Sushi Bars go they will always be 3 stars for me because I don't actually go for the Sushi. My wife had a discount coupon for us to eat at this establishment and since we were in the neighborhood we decided to stop in. The place is very nice and happy hour was in full effect when arrived so that was a good thing. We had the Vegetable Tempura and Miso Soup.....both were very good. The service was decent even though they seated us near the kitchen entrance. I don't know if I need to go back but it wasn't a terrible experience at all so I would recommend it to Sushi Lovers. Eat, Drink, and be Merry, my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"Bad experience on reservation. Called before we left the house and reserved seats for 15 people, they did not notify us that there's no seat available. We drove 2 hours to try their food and hoping to get  seated on time.  instead, we have to wait 2 hours. We ended up going to the other new ra sushi  at north Scottsdale since there was no wait and food were served less than the time waiting on this branch"}
{"text":"Every time I visit this restaurant the service is very slow. We ordered edamames as appetizers and they were served along with the main entree. We ordered drinks as soon as we arrived and the drinks were served half way through the main course. The disappointing part was that the restaurant was not crowded and the server was not even apologetic. The food was good."}
{"text":"Came in for happy hour to meet with some friends.  The specials are mediocre at best.  I enjoyed my simple Jim Beam on the rocks with a spicy shrimp roll.  The roll itself looked like it might of been a training exercise or its just how they prepare happy hour food items (fast and not pretty at all.)  
We enjoyed the patio that had misters and is nicely positioned in the shade after 3p.m."}
{"text":"Best place for sushi. We had Bruce a new server that just started there. He was amazing and the food was excellent! I will be going back really soon! Great service and great environment!"}
{"text":"Went there this evening for \"happy hour from 3:00 till closing.\"  We had the yellowtail nigiri, salmon nigiri, spicy salmon roll, spicy yellowtail roll, seaweed salad, tuna nigiri, edamame, and hot sake.

I ate the edamame, seaweed salad, salmon nigiri, spicy salmon roll, tuna nigiri.   The rice was soft but not mushy.   And it wasn't hard, which is from not enough water added when it cooks.   UGHHH!   The salmon nigiri and the tuna nigiri were oh, so fresh.   The spicy salmon roll was quite tasty.    The edamame was, well, edamame.   The seaweed salad was similar to that premade in the grocery stores, but this version was a little tastier.   I didn't sample the rest of the items ordered, but I'm told they were delish.

I'm sorry I didn't take a photo of all of the food, but what is presented is a representative example.

I would go back.   I thought I had been to a Ra Sushi prior, and didn't like it, but with or without being the first time or second, I liked it."}
{"text":"The food was great but our waiter and the ambiance was horrible... Our waiter forgot half our drinks, after we asked twice. We we finally got our drinks they tasted horrible. He then disappeared for 18 minutes - we timed it as a joke but then we were actually getting pissed. Finally, there were only five tables in the inside and they sat us all right next to each other crammed it. Dumb. Go 15 minutes north to Nori Sushi in north scottsdale, much better!"}
{"text":"Solid place for happy hour.  The california and tooty maki rolls were good.  Salmon and yellowtail sashimi were solid.  Nice prices until 7PM. Good music."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place at happy hour as they have some really go prices. All of their appetizers are half off as well as a few of their drinks. I do wish they had more rolls on the happy hour menu but hey you take what you can get. You can eat pretty good for less than $10 during happy hour and that includes a beer. Not too shabby if you are on a budget like me! :)"}
{"text":"Cool vibe but sushi quality is consistently poor. Great patio so if you want a drink and not sushi this could be your spot."}
{"text":"This server never stopped smiling. Sake goes very well with yellowtail sashimi and spicy yellowtail rolls."}
{"text":"Ordered roasted shishito peppers, short ribs, and a chirashi bowl for lunch.  The chirashi bowl came with miso soup.   The soup was very light  and delicious. Love the shishito peppers.  It brought back my childhood memories.  I've eaten at many Japanese restaurants in the past but this was the first time i have seen it on the menu.   The  chirashi bowl had a few kinds of fish chunks with some vegetables and it was good.  However, the short ribs were dry and had no taste.  It was also cold.  If you have a short lunch time you should not go there."}
{"text":"Okay, okay... I know this is like my 4th update, but things have really changed! RA has really stepped it up with its management and quality of food. I still LOVE their happy hour, and I am here at least once a week with friends. If there is ever a problem- and there rarely is anymore- the management fixes it at once. I still love the garlic citrus yellowtail, and have added new favorites to my list as well, including the crunchy calamari rill, zonie roll, rainbow roll, etc. 
Although I still think most of their rolls are small (the zonie roll, and others), their happy hour prices make them affordable. I wouldn't go here during a regular, non-happy hour time, unless it was for a lunch special. In addition, their drinks are delicious. I like the dragon bite and the blushing geisha. I really recommend going in for their happy hour deals! 
One pointer - I do not recommend sitting in the bar area. The service in that area has not improved, and you can get the same happy hour prices in the dining room area with far better service. The only downfall to the whole indoor area of the restaurant is that it is very, very loud. Also- they could improve their hostesses a little- I don't know if it is a lack of training or what, but they always seem clueless, cold and brash."}
{"text":"You could read the long version or the TL; DR version.  Here's that version, Meh
So we came here looking to celebrate.  Honestly I thought this was another much fancier place, but it was close and the food wasn't bad the last time we came.  We were seated immediately and had reservations that definitely were not necessary for a Tuesday afternoon.  We didn't get a better table because of the reservations and it looks like we missed the happy hour specials.  We ended up getting an appetizer, the Zonie Roll, the spicy yellow tail roll, and the Pacific roll.  The rolls themselves were creative and OK.  The fish wasn't super fresh but the rolls had good flavor to them.  Definitely not a place I'd go to WOW someone, more like somewhere we'd go if we were lazy.  The Happy Hour specials looked cool, and they do a reverse happy hour which is also fun.  Our rolls took FOREVER to come out though, to the point that the birthday party to the right of us with about 15 people got their food first even though we were seated first.  They apologized twice and took a roll off the bill, but still it didn't leave a great taste in our mouths.  The sushi didn't either.  So Meh, we thought it was alright.  Unlikely to be back.  Sushi you remain an elusive mistress in Phoenix."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi restaurant by far.

Happy hour is from 4-7 and amazing. They also have a reverse happy hour late night.

I've had really good service at the Kierland location... 

So pretty at night! Great atmosphere to go out and have some drinks and HEALTHY food with friends."}
{"text":"Thank you Hannah for setting up my wedding party reservation!  Hannah was sweet and helpful! Great staff at this location!"}
{"text":"Shopping at Kierland over the holiday weekend & got hungry, so we decided to try RA. I originally saw RA in Old Town, but opted to dine elsewhere. Methinks it was divine intervention that led us here the next day.
 
Their HH goes from 3-7p, Mon-Sat. Now that's a good HH! We ordered a shrimp tempura roll, spicy tuna & rainbow roll. Like previously mentioned on here, I was amazed that they had a rainbow roll on their HH menu. 
 
Our sushi & service was great, AND it was a cheap dinner! We will definitely come back when in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a sushi happy hour in North Scottsdale as Brigham Young would say: \"This is the place\".  Although, I don't think he would have a half price cocktail like me :).  Ra has a nice large patio to relax and nosh on some rolls.  If rolls aren't your thang then I would recc the pineapple cheese wonton's and seaweed salad.  I also like their tootie, veggie and dragon rolls.  Wide selection of items on happy hour, great service..winner, winner sushi dinner!"}
{"text":"Gotta love it their food! We moved from Texas. This restaurant is there.. I am glad a piece of Texas in here in Scottsdale! I work close by to this restaurant, today we ordered their bento box and poke bowl. Y'all are missing out if you haven't been there! The lady that took our carry out order was pleasant and accommodating. Didn't have any issues when I came to pick up our lunch. Thank you for being awesome!"}
{"text":"I usually don't go to RA since the only one that I thought was close to my house was the one in Old Town Scottsdale and the place was not to my liking.  
Recently, I discover their Kierland Commons location which has a great outdoor seating area and it's spacious with their signature red decor.  The other thing I discovered was their Happy Hour menu, which I must say, is probably one of the best in town in terms of prices and offerings.
$1 sake, sushi like salmon and yellowtail for $2.50, generous servings for friend calamari for less then $4, shrimp cerviche for less than $5.  This is my new fav place for happy hour- I can hang out here, eat my full, drink all the sake I want without breaking the bank!"}
{"text":"Everything was so good, sushi was amazing, and gyoza was to die for. Amazing service, every one was so nice and attentive. This was our first date as newly weds, and they really pulled out all the stops."}
{"text":"This Ra location has been a staple at Kierland for what feels like ages now... But as of late, service has been extra top notch. I always sit at the bar, and am yet to be dissatisfied. 
Just a few shout outs to some of the excellent bartenders who not only make wonderful drinks, but who make mine and my friends' experiences always memorable:
Ali, Khalid, Danielle, Taylor, or Katie.
A special thanks to Ali. Better than your favorite bartender, and better than your favorite bartender's favorite bartender.

You have a great team, excellent sashimi, and if you're lucky enough to see Sasha (the blonde) running around, then your meal will already be unrivaled."}
{"text":"The sushi was marginal... the service was maybe less.. there was a bird flying around I  the restaurant, and it made me lose my appetite"}
{"text":"I could cook a meal faster than they could acknowledge and seat me. So I went to Safeway and cooked, and RA gets a one star review."}
{"text":"My family of 5 visited RA Sushi around 7pm on a Sunday. We didn't have reservations and the restaurant was exceptionally busy so that is where we ran into a lot of snags, or so the server said. We waited for 30 minutes for a table, which was fine because we hadn't seen each other in so long. We were seated and waited another 30 minutes for edamame and miso soup. Our server brought out our rolls in varying order, not timing the dishes at all. The Vegas roll was mediocre at best, overwhelmed by cheap flavors and additives like cream cheese. I got the spicy yellowtail roll which should've been divine, but tasted like tuna salad from Subway. We had to ask the server for wasabi and ginger, sushi house stables everywhere else. The server also forgot one of our rolls and after telling us she forgot it, brought a completely different roll 40 MINUTES LATER. She didn't apologize but instead gave us a voucher for a free app or sushi roll but told my sister \"they may not take it because it says it's expired.\" I just don't get it. For $100 worth of sushi, totally not worth it. Bad service, bad rolls, no hospitality...the polar opposite of my experience with RA Sushi in Chicago."}
{"text":"We ended up going here cause we were in the area and craving sushi. I wish we would have drove a little further cause this place has gone down hill. I used to go here a few years ago and i use to like it. I guess there are so many sushi places now and they are just better than Ra. We got two sushi rolls and i laught when the waitress brought them to the table. These were the smallest rolls I had ever seen and it was not a half portion cause of happy hour or anything. They were as big around as a quarter. No Kidding! I was really wanting to pig out on some sushi rolls but after seeing those we just ordered teriyaki chicken which I have to say was good. Teriyaki is not my favorite but this was alright. I most likely will not be back but if I find myself there I will get a dinner entree and not the sushi. Drinks were stiff and delicous and waitress was good and friendly. Nothing good  to say for the sushi and thats sad when the word sushi is in the name of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Much better...new manager I think?  I've been coming here forever and was about to give up...I am glad I didn't.  Lunch has been great lately, they give you a 10$ coupon every time for the next lunch. Just log in take a survey get a number.....so generous. Huge servings. Hot hot soup, excellent salad. Great sashimi....give them another try. One word to corporate, please remodel the disgusting women's  bathroom...it is dark.  Freezing, music is blaring. The stalls doors are broken, the hot water spigot is broken......I cannot stand this bathroom. It is raunchy.  The walls are a deep disgusting red with shitty shitty art decoupaged to the walls.  This bathroom is nasty....I think you could find the capital to do a redo....I bitch about it enough and will post photos next time I visit. Please inspect your properties."}
{"text":"I'm a tourist in this area but was meeting up with 2 old friends.  Long ago we had all visited Japan together and we were interested in sushi close to where we were.  We did not expect Japan-style sushi in Arizona.  We did not make a reservation.  

We were seated promptly, and had drinks quickly.  It took a bit to place our order but I was with old friends and didn't mind the conversation.  When sushi started arriving and drinks started coming out, the service was efficient and courteous and right on.

This Kierland Commons atmosphere could exist anywhere.  I felt like I could have been in California or Texas or Washington DC.

Freshness is a key ingredient with sushi, and everything on our table seemed to have a hint of freshness.  I'm not rushing back but I also don't live in Arizona."}
{"text":"Jennifer our pirate bartender was more concerned with keeping her dress clean then shaking my martini. 

She realized after she poured whiskey into a glass that the bar doesn't carry ginger and proceeded to ask if she created a concoction of sodas in a glass if it would be acceptable to be compared to ginger ale. 

She had no personality and to make it worse her manager was sitting at the end of the  bar and flirting with college boys with her and ignoring the entire bar. The poor guy near us hadn't even been greeted for almost 15 min!!

The food is good but don't come to this location and expect any ounce of service!"}
{"text":"I'm normally not one to rush to a Ra restaurant because I've had better sushi somewhere else but my last visit here was good. Service can definitely improve though because our waiter took forever to acknowledge and attend to us, but the sushi we ordered was delicious. We also enjoyed sitting out on the patio. I would definitely go for happy hour with friends and/or coworkers especially since they have specials!"}
{"text":"I was actually with Ashley b from the below review and can verify what she says really disappointing. We thought we would try again last night and all I can say was what a waste of money. 

To start we sat down and the music was blaring like a night club. We asked the server if we could move or it could be turned down just a little. She said \" I don't have the authority to adjust music\". Also all of the tables outside where covered in old plates and napkins. Probably 5 dirty tables where near us and where not cleaned during our stay as their was only one server for the lounge and patio. Pretty hard to dye your job when you are so short staffed. We finally were moved outside and then had to wait 15 minutes to have a heater turned on. No offense but it's Scottsdale in the winter. Every restaurant in Scottsdale has these on and working in the winter. 

The food didn't make anything better. I had the Vegas roll which took about 30 minutes and my girlfriend had the spicy salmon roll. Which came out once I was done eating about 45 minutes after ordering. Once her food came out she knew it wasn't what she normally has here and walked it back to the server. She received quite a bit of attitude and eventually decided she just wanted to leave and not have another roll.

The manager came out a little while later(he had to finish his sake he was drinking at the bar). He kept asking if we were happy and full and we said yes so we could get out of this poor experience. What I should have said was how can she be full when she walked food back to you as she didn't like it and how can we be happy when we are sitting around 3 dirty tables and waited almost an hour for sushi. 

We use to come here a good amount but our last two experiences where so poor I think we will find somewhere else to go for late night dining. Really a shame as we both work late hours and use to enjoy late night happy hour. I think we would try it again if the management team actually cared and tried to improve the service or maybe schedule enough staff not to burn out the server they have and given decent service."}
{"text":"It was hard to enjoy anything with the music so loud. We ordered a few happy hour items, and the quality has been going down and the loudness has increased. We are done with this place."}
{"text":"Not much is open in Scottsdale at 10pm on a Sunday night.  Did a little Yelp searching and found a few places with late night happy hours... Yard House, Elephant Bar, and RA.  Since RA's happy hour was only on Sunday nights, figured I'd give it a try.  The place was going on, but we were served pretty promptly.  All RA's seem the same to me... the fish is average, the ambiance is good, and if you go for happy hour, it's a steal.  We had two rolls, some nigiri, and edamame and our bill was $19.

Basically, the place is a 3* joint to me.  But they get an extra star for their Red Cross promotion.  With your bill, you can leave a donation on your card, and RA will match it 100%.  And this wasn't a one-day promo, it goes til mid-May!  Not sure if it's nationwide, but definitely come support RA as this is pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Say at the bar for lunch. Taylor serving the bar was very welcoming and made great recommendations!

I had the crazy monkey roll and was impressed that I could dip it in the mango sauce and avoid soy sauce. 

Also, the indoor/outdoor seating arrangement creates a positive ambiance."}
{"text":"Awesome experience from Sasha the food and atmosphere were great only bad thing was the lady next to me at the bar complaining about everything! Don't know what the big deal was but we got here at the same time and I loved everything!"}
{"text":"Great trendy Sushi in Old Scottsdale. The yellowtail and chili sashimi is excellent as are the spring rolls with a sweet (almost peanuty) mustard sauce). I also had a roll with crab, cream cheese and shrimp tempura on top - very rich and hard to eat in one piece but delicious. This is my third time here - never been disappointed.

Service is friendly and competent."}
{"text":"I Love this Place !!! one of my FAVS for Sushi !  they have great Bento Boxes for lunch that are resonable priced, my Favorite is the Shrimp Tempura ! Good prices on Cocktails, and Japanese Beer !  if you get on their e-mail list, they will send you coupons, that are $10.00, and $20.00 off, and great to Celebrate birthday's !  Good Service, also !"}
{"text":"RA Sushi is a must try when you're in the Scottsdale area!  A beautiful interior with red accents, dark wood grains, and a beautiful bar area make it a comfortable experience.
The Las Vegas Roll was out of this world, as well as a great effort is made on the more traditional California and Rainbow Rolls!
There's a happy hour everyday that includes drinks and sushi rolls.  The Sunday happy hour goes from 3pm-close, which gives you plenty of time for sakes and sushi!"}
{"text":"Don't like the new location. Service was slow and speciality rolls were too rich and greasy. Bad choice moving out of Kierland. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Tops the sushi places in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Their yellowtail sashimi had BLOOD on it. The chef said that \"it is ok and not a big issue\". Who will eat the raw fish with blood on it???? They did not apologize at all and simply gave me an extra piece. The salmon sashimi tasted bad and I could not finish them.

I am a sashimi lover, but this was the worst experience for me. They didn't even clean the fish before serving!! I felt so nauseous that I did not have any raw fish for a while. Also their response really let me down."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for my birthday. Seeing as I had a choice of anyplace I wanted to eat and I chose to have sushi. Mine you, this is my 3rd time trying sushi, EVER! So he decided to bring me to RA. As an appetizer we ordered the steamed edamame as well as the Pineapple Cheese Wontons. The edamame and the wontons were very good, the pineapple sauce for dipping was bomb. I highly recommend those. For lunch I ended up having the RAcking Roll and the California Roll. I loved the RAcking Roll, very delicious and the shrimp on top of the roll was amazing. I absolutely, loved it. The California Roll just seemed so basic to me, don't get me wrong - it was good. But after consuming the RAcking Roll, I wanted more flavor and taste. All and all, our experience was very good. The waitress was nice and we had great service. I would definetly return again!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed RA when it was in the Kieran's. This is my first time to the new location. The customer service was very poor starting with the hostess. The food quality also has gone way downhill. I have no plans to return to what used to be a great restaurant."}
{"text":"The slowest service EVER ! Don't get me wrong, they have good sushi but their service is extremely slow. I feel bad for the waitress, she was very  stressed out and apologetic.. they are always understaffed."}
{"text":"We've been going to Ra since my daughter was 6 years old - a family tradition. The best quality here in AZ was at the Kierland location, but they closed that down so we started driving to the one in north Scottsdale that became its replacement. Might be a management thing, but the quality's gone down since that closure. Or maybe that was the time of the corporate buyout. At any rate, we have stopped going as often. Overall the restaurant just went downhill. Family favorites like the tunacado have really suffered - the tuna used to be SO fresh and of such high quality - truly memorable. Now it's the same tuna you can find at any corner sushi bar.  

But the clincher is this .... my daughter's home from college and we went to Ra for old time's sake last weekend. I ordered what has always been the star of the menu, the Hamachi Kama (I know, it's not sushi, but it was AMAZING), only to be told it's been taken off the menu.  

Big misstep for Ra... just one of many but this last one was sort of the nail in the coffin. At this point there is no reason to go to Ra anymore. Hamachi Kama was the last thing they did truly well - the item that set them apart from the other 50+ sushi joints in this big city. Sure, others have it, but no one does it quite like Ra did - sizable, fresh, broiled to a beautiful crisp without overcooking the center, and the sauce they served it up with was unique and stellar. Good enough to cause cravings... why would they eliminate the last great thing on the menu?

Disappointing to see this trajectory, but it looks like it's goodbye to Ra after all these years."}
{"text":"Positive: 
Still great food and great service. Beautiful decor and the bathroom is way much nicer than in the old location in Kierland. My fave one is Barachirashi used to be \"lunch sashimi assortment\" still the same delicious flavor is just different name.

Negative:
The new location in NORTH SCOTTSDALE
Is not as intimate as in the old location. If you sit at the patio during the lunch time forget it, it's very noisy from the traffic on the road and the air traffic from nearby airport.

If you wanted to have intimate/quieter lunch /dinner, sit inside and enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"love this place. We were a group of 4 and tried four different kinds of sushi rolls and all were amazing :) would definitely recommend this place for anyone wanting sushi."}
{"text":"We love coming here for happy hour. The service staff is very attentive the sushi is great and the \"rock n roll\" music on the patio is fun. We always have a good time at the location in Kieland. Try the shishisto peppers. Excellent!"}
{"text":"Pros: trendy scene, good music, nice atmosphere, and one of the greatest happy hours in the valley
Cons: very mediocre sushi, not very authentic, trendy scene (if hip young Scottsdale 20-somethings don't do it for you)

You make the call."}
{"text":"I like this location a lot better than their old Kierland Commons one which has since closed. Pro tip: sign up for their email club and you'll receive a free bento for your half-birthday. We always order their bentos for lunch because they are a pretty good deal. I've tried their unagi (fresh water eel) once but the price was too steep for 2 pieces. Their tempura is phenomenal- the best I've tried in AZ. Great portions too!"}
{"text":"It's good and staff was nice and attentive. Nice bar area. Patio is large, good place for large groups. Although right next to the road so it can loud."}
{"text":"Great place for on-point Japanese fare! They offer universally known sashimi, rolls, hand rolls, etc as well as their house specialties.

But on a personal note, this venue is a jinx for me in the dating world. Every single, bloody date I have here ends up a shit show! I always figure it's a safe, non-threatening place for sushi in exotic decor.

But with all of the bad dates, I haven't had a bad sushi roll here. Do they salt their Edamame too much? Yeah. Are their prices a tad on steep side? Sure. But, I still dig 'em.

I will eat here again, but only in the presence of well-known fam and friends."}
{"text":"When it comes to sushi my eyes are ALWAYS bigger than my stomach and I just can't seem to avoid spending a tiny fortune, drats!

I hadn't been to Ra in a severely long time and was pleasantly surprised and wonderfully satisfied upon this recent re-visit!

Items we ordered that I care enough to remember and am salivating at the memory are: 
Beef Tataki Roll - artichoke, asparagus, roasted red pepper & avocado rolled & topped with seared beef, served with creamy wasabi & drizzled with black pepper soy
OMG!
Mango Lobster Roll - lobster mix, avocado & cucumber rolled & topped with thinly sliced mango, served with mango-tobiko & kiwi-wasabi sauces
So Yum!!!"}
{"text":"It was OK, but I remember it being much better. Met a friend there for dinner and should have chosen a different place just for the noise level. The place is loud, so I'm officially old. The bar is right in the front and was packed at 7 on a Saturday, but they sat us right away at the sushi bar. The service was quick and the sushi chef was helpful, though it was hard to hear him (again, old). 

My wife and I had the 'RA'llipop, RAckin Roll, Chili Ponzu Yellowtail, toro nigiri, salmon nigiri, king crab nigiri. My buddy ordered a watermelon and kiwi salad with shrimp and sushi that I lost track of. When we asked the sushi chef about salmon skin he told us it was 'kind of like bacon' and made some for us to try (no, not like bacon...).

The RAllipops and the Chili Ponzu were the standouts of the evening and the toro nigiri and king crab nigiri were a bit of a disappointment. The toro was a little fattier than I like (I know, some folks like that), and the king crab had a lot less flavor than I'd remembered it having and tasted a little like refrigerator. 

I would have given four stars (the service was five) but for the value. I really expected knock out sushi. It was 'good sushi', at a 'great sushi' price point. (And too loud for this old man)."}
{"text":"I adore RA!  They have a great selection of sushi.  Go for Happy Hour.  Its only a couple of hours, but you really get some great items for pretty cheap.  You can even get a large Asahi for about $5!"}
{"text":"We won't be back. This was by far the worst service we have received in a long time. We went for a late lunch, arriving at 1:50, nobody even brought water to the table until 2:05, and we had to ask for it. The server that took our drink order initially refused to do it because \"it wasn't his table.\" Well, he took our drink order, someone else took our food order, a third person brought our food, had to flag down the hostess for a water refill, and then they \"had to get our softshell crab roll on the fly\" because \"the kitchen messed up.\"

Um no. The waiter(s) messed up. Don't blame the chef for not putting the order in. Honestly, we have given Ra a few chances over the years to redeem themselves, but when two people spend $60 for lunch we expect much better service. 

The food was fine. Ra, for just \"fine\" food, this really isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Ra is a sushi classic in AZ. I love everything here except the calamari, the thick pieces just aren't my thing.

The service is decent and the menu is simple, great happy hour!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place 2 stars because the food was just ok.  The service was some of the worst I've ever experienced. It was early around 5:00pm and the hostess wouldn't give us (wife and 3 yr old) a booth because they were saving it for a party of 5 or more, but the interesting thing is that they seated a party of three after us and the other booths were empty up until the time we left.  

Our waitress really could care less if we enjoyed our food or if we wanted more.  My wife had god knows what in the bottom of her water cup and nicely asked her for another water, no sorry or here's your water she just put it down on the table and walked away.  We ate and she didn't check to see how our food was and if we needed anything.  About 30 mins later she said to us you're done right, can I bring your check...I'm thinking to myself no desert or do we want anything else???  

Now the food, they had plenty of sushi chefs and our crunch rolls tasted like they had been made and put in the walk-in for an hour.  The fish was cold, but the quality tasted stale. I have been to RA in California countless times and the experience was completely the opposite and went there all the time.

Not going back here and if you go buyer beware."}
{"text":"We have tried to go to this location twice now. This time we made a reservation online, after which they called us and said \"sorry we can't take your reservation.\" We will not be going back to this location, and likely not back to another Ra again."}
{"text":"Always a good experience here. We only seem to come when we have $20 half birthday certificates and our waiter is usually the same guy (hi Jimmy), but no complaints. I love coming during happy hour and getting more bang for my buck. We love their \"RA\"ckin' shrimp appetizer, the sauce is so good. Sushi is always reliable. Out of the desserts I've tried, I love the banana split maki. The mochi is okay and the fried gelato wasn't as good as I anticipated."}
{"text":"Good selections.  Food good.  Happy hour specials.   Indoor and outdoor seating.  Open late."}
{"text":"I don't know what has happened to my beloved Ra Sushi Bar... I have been coming to RA for as long as I can remember, but over the last couple of years things have really gone down hill for them. But when they recently relocated from Kierland Commons to down the street a bit, I thought why not give this place another shot.
Service was spotty, food was average at best when I actually got it ( waited over 20 minutes for an order of edamame). I was so hoping that things would have improved but if anything they have gotten worse. 
It's a solid spot for HH, outside of that I would skip it!"}
{"text":"While I don't consider myself a sushi connoisseur, I do know good service. I'm always willing to give you the benefit of the doubt and cut you some slack, but when there are only 4 tables and the place is empty, cmon. It seemed there were more workers than customers and it literally took 1.5 hours for dinner. Wtf. 

10 minutes just to get waited on. Another 15 for him to come back to take our order. All pepsi products, no dr pepper or pibb (ugh!). Even the sushi on the happy hour seemed outrageous. 

With so many sushi places, no real reason to come back here. Too expensive, too poor of service, good food I guess, but most sushi tastes the same to me."}
{"text":"I love the food here!  The sushi is always so fresh and delicious, and everything has such great flavor. The staff is always friendly, although possibly not trained the best on the official terms of ingredients in their dishes.  You can always find a table with a minimum wait. Their happy hour is fantastic. I love it!  This is a staple in our rotation of restaurants."}
{"text":"Ordered Mai Tai, a drink I typically only get at APAC-Themed restaurants. Bar messaged through waiter, \"No Go.\" Really? Sensing that we'd better stick to simpler drinks, ordered a vodka Martini, dry, olives on side. It arrived warm! Third try, I hunted down our waiter, and ordered Sake and finally discovered the bartender's strength.

We had a group of about 15. Too large for one waiter, but management must have been inspired by bartender's limited imagination. Despite the slow service, we were resigned to our one server.

Leaving, I asked the hostess to please call a cab for the remaining half dozen guests in our party wishing to leave. \"Cab?\" She asked, cocking her head like an inquisitive Spaniel. \"Yes, a Taxi,\" I replied hoping to select a term in her vocabulary. She stared, blue eyes in the headlights of antiquated language: I may as well be asking for a \"Carriage.\"

We left using Uber."}
{"text":"Decent, the happy hour is good.  The patio is nice and food is generally good!"}
{"text":"Visiting Scottsdale and was craving sushi!  This was definitely an excellent choice.  If you are looking for a quiet sushi spot, this is not it, great music, atmosphere, and folks having a good time!  We live in Viva Las Vegas so of course we had to try the Vegas Roll and the Yellowtail Roll was absolutely delicious! My absolute favorite was the Sashimi Salad made with Tuna, yellowtail, salmon and shrimp tossed with mixed green seaweed, cucumber, and avocado!  What's not to love?"}
{"text":"The most recent time I went to RA, the hostess was MIA so I walked past the entrance and stood awkwardly at the bar for a few minutes. A girl whom I assumed to be the hostess walked by me and I smiled dumbly, hoping she would assume I needed help... but she smiled and kept walking. So I walked back to the hostess counter and stood there waiting for her to acknowledge me. Basically every time I go it's a version of this story.

The sushi is cheaper than Stingray and better than Sapporo, but I almost need to prepare myself for battle to just get a meal there."}
{"text":"Ra has a hip fun setting and they are open late which is a real plus for this night owl. On the other hand it can get a little pricey and it's not the best sushi I have had. I would recommend coming in during happy hour or getting there lunch card and coming in for lunch. They offer a lot of fun and creative rolls which you won't find anywhere else such as the Arizona roll or my friends favorite the Crazy Monkey Roll. Overall if you want a young atmosphere with some good sushi RA is your place."}
{"text":"Was going to Ra when they only had one store in Scottsdale.  They still have a great ambiance and the food is consistent.  Not my favorite sushi but as a place to go for happy hour and to hang with friends, I recommend it highly.  Patio is great and Kara is one of the best and nicest bartenders you will ever meet."}
{"text":"Really like RA for what it is. I know it's not so \"authentic\" to the sushi purists, but the presentation of the dishes is pretty and the seasonings are terrific and everything tastes great.

Dustin has been my server a couple times and he does a fabulous job. Plus he has great skin! In fact, being lovely seems to be a server requirement here, because they all are.

The drink and food menus are very creative and extensive,  so plan to spend some time perusing. 
If you are a hot, spicy pepper freak,  be SURE to order the shishito peppers!  They are a meal in themselves. 

My only complaint with this place is that sometimes (well, frequently) you have to wait awhile for someone to show up at the hostess desk to seat you. This is also true for the downtown Scottsdale location. ...and they have lovely servers, too. I'm sensing a corporate theme here."}
{"text":"BEST sushi and one of the best happy hours in the Phoenix area! Definitely come for happy hour as the deals cannot be beat.  My favorites are the RAckin' Shrimp and the Las Vegas roll. Both are unbelievably delicious.

My mouth is watering just thinking about it...."}
{"text":"Its everywhere so its hard to say all you can write is about certain locations, right?

Well I go to the one in Old Town scottsdale a bit but mainly in Kierland so thats what this is about.

smile hour- is great , they offer super deals on drinks and food during the happy hours so you cant beat it.

Service and smiles- I highly recommend sitting at or in the bar for the best service. The ladies seem to have worked there for a long time and rock out the drinks and conversation.

Aroma- although most sushi places have a smell to them the down side of sitting at the bar is you get the normal smells plus thestale beer of the bar, but I think its such a great place , you get over it real quick. PLus you can always sit on the patio and people watch , which is the BEST!

Nom Noms- Miso soup, Las Vegas Roll( not my fav but every person I know lves it) , caterpillar rool and any sashimi, will always be fast and fresh. Never a complaint there.

Break it down Jess- Its corprate so they cant really screw up but of all the RA's I have been to cleanliness, service, staff and vibe, this is by far the best . Hopefully I will see you there."}
{"text":"Had lunch here the other day....the food was good. My husband had the New Zealand roll and I had the Salmon Teriyaki so I could try a benton box which I had never had before.....it was nice but next time I think I will order a roll as I sampled some of the New Zealand roll and it was delicious. The music was fun but just a little too loud....it was killing my appetite and making me want to go dancing instead! lol There were a few nice wines to choose from on the menu and our waitress was very good!....will return again."}
{"text":"I think it's very hard to find good sushi in this area but it was a good, dependable place to get your sushi fix. My friend got a lobster soup that was kind of sour and too hot for her. I'm surprise they didn't have vinegar or coconut milk to make it less spicy. I ordered a roll which had spicy tuna and cream cheese and it was yummy. My boyfriend ordered a sashimi salad which was very tasty. The service was very good."}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here for the happy hour/reverse happy hour. The staff is hit or miss, if you a have a good one then you will be well taken care of unfortunately if you have a bad one prepare to wait forever to even order. 
I'd love a few more vegetarian options on there but I definitely make do with what they've got. Drinks are usually good but sometimes a little strong for me, but I'm a wuss so people who like to taste the alcohol will like them a lot. :) 
They aren't really prepared for younger kids to come in so keep that in mind if you are bringing family. Oh. and its ALWAYS really loud with the music."}
{"text":"I came here on a Sunday afternoon, around 2pm. Bartender was very nice. But, that's about all I can say that's positive. I hear that they have a good happy hour menu, but unfortunately I wasn't there during their designated times. As a result, I paid a huge premium for very average at best Sushi. My nigiri salmon was so fishy that I wondered if I should be eating it raw. The rolls were assembled poorly with sloppy rice bits everywhere. The overall experience was disappointing, to say the least. I realize you are going to pay a premium at Scottsdale Quarters because the restaurant's overhead must be out of control. But at least put a good product on the table."}
{"text":"We came here this past Sunday for lunch.  The place was well lit and open for 11:30 AM.  Service was great and we were seated quick.  I was craving sushi, so half of our party decided on about six rolls. Yes...six!  

In waiting for our rolls we ordered some garlic edamame. Holy cow was that good!  I was glad to see they served Pepsi since nearly all places serve Coke; though I did get some iced team. Good stuff!

I ordered some of the best rolls I have ever had.  It was just delicious!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"We went there on 4/16 for a date night and had never been to a RA Sushi restaurant before. We made a reservation because we didn't know what to expect, since it was also on the other side of town from us. Turns out, we didn't need the reservation, they started getting busy around 7pm and we had gotten there a little earlier to take advantage of happy hour specials. We started out with some spring rolls - not much flavor and they reminded my husband of frozen spring rolls from a grocery store. Then we had the chicken katsu, viva las vegas roll, and the king crab roll. Other than the spring rolls, our food was great!! Our server was awesome and very personable too. Will definitely go back and hopefully snag a patio table!"}
{"text":"The wife and I are hanging out at Kierland doing the window shopping thing and it's time to eat.  Sushi sounds good!  Oh' look it's RA Sushi!  (Ok so we rarely have a plan...)  Just so happens it's happy hour and there is some live event being video taped for channel 3 TV.  Place is packed with silk and the men who love them....to our amazement we were seated right away albeit next to the kitchen but oh well...

RA is a place for redefined sushi, tetaki, sashimi and assorted japanese style choices...we tried most of their specialty plates from the happy hour menu and a couple of signature rolls from the menu.  I tried to dislike the food, but, it's good!  And you cannot beat the prices for happy hour!  

Turns out the taping was a charity event for a young man battling cancer, proceeds from a special menu were being donated by RA.  Kudos for that!

RA isn't my kinda thing but I would go back for happy hour or late night...the scene is a little too moda LA for me."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with my best friends. Great food and drinks. Wade, the gm took care of us after a mix up with the wait staff. We come here often and will be back for the way he handled the situation. Thanks Wade."}
{"text":"A local favorite sushi place of mine. As are all their locations. Nothing can beat their happy hour and the red lights hanging from the ceiling give it a dark cozy atmosphere. I would recommend the Mango Margarita off the happy hour menu as a good choice. Great date place."}
{"text":"We hit this Ra at least once a week. Happy Hour has the best prices and offerings. Our favorites here are the Seared Ahi, Rackin Shrimp and all the Poke offerings. You can't go wrong with Ra, it's a tried and true favorite. The best bang for your buck is definitely daily happy hour 3-7 pm."}
{"text":"I love RA's happy hour! And their patio is great for a gathering!! I definitely recommend getting an array of rolls and other appetizers."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service by Danielle.  We sat there for 10 min. She gave us menus. 
She Never said anything to let us know she would return. 
When she did return we order waters and Asked if we could order our food. 
We had a small window and already waited 10 min. 
She threw her ice scoop and said \"we all have small windows\". We got up and left. 
The people around us couldn't believe it. 
I'm a bartender. I know what it's like when you are busy. Vocalize to YOUR CUSTOMERS!! It's not that hard!!! She is a rude person with a horrible attitude. We will not return in your establishment. 
There is ZERO reason to be treated that way! 
Danielle You work for tips! 
Maybe YOU need a BIG window in customer service."}
{"text":"First off - sushi in Phoenix?1? At least, that was what I was thinking when I walked by this place, which looks like a decent place to stop in, but I will admit, I hesitated a bit. After glancing at the menu and seeing the sushi that was on peoples' plates, though, I was convinced it was worth a try.

If you're staying at the nearby Westin Kierland Resort, this is totally worth it - prices are good, beer is cold, and they have a huge menu, full of options for everyone, even the non-sushi eaters in your party. (I was visiting with a total vegetarian friend, and he said his meal was great...)

I started off with the garlic edamame. I know, you are asking yourself, \"What the hell is GARLIC edamame?\" It's awesome stuff, is what that is. You need it. Get it. It has a bit of a bite to it, but it's hardly prohibitively spicy. It's loaded with garlicky spicy goodness. Great choice.

Then, I proceeded to order about 1/3 of what I usually get, in order to get a feel for their quality. I ordered 2 pieces each of salmon roe (ikura), fluke (hirame), yellowtail (hamachi), and salmon (sake) nigiri, expecting middle of the road quality fish that was at best OK. Surprise! It was awesome! The quality of the fish I had cannot be overstated. Each piece of sushi was served at the correct temperature and was a smooth mouthful of deliciousness - this is no fast food or supermarket sushi joint. I just had to go back and get more hirame and hamachi; they were that good. I also indulged in their crunchy calamari roll, which I must say is a bit gimmicky, but also totally delicious - go for it.

We finished with their version of a creme brûlée, and it was tasty. Overall, a super unexpected find. I had to force myself to try a different restaurant the following day for lunch, because I could totally see myself coming here for ALL of the meals during the conference. I am happy to say - YES, sushi in Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Here for lunch, as always service is excellent, food is consistent (keep in mind we've only ever ordered sushi).

This time around we notice that they got rid of the Sushi sheet and pencil where you can mark your order and just give to the server. I would think it's quit a bit harder on the server, especially if your party is ordering a lot. I also took note that the menus were redone to incorporate the calories to all the items (which I loved). We ordered Green Tea and a Kirin. For Sushi, we ordered Sea Urchin, Salmon, Smelt Eggs with Quail Eggs and a Yellow Tail Sashimi. All the fish was fresh and tasted good.

Always good to have a spot to stop by for a quick bite to eat for lunch."}
{"text":"New HH menu on 12/21/11. Pacific roll for $6 is a steal & very good. 

The very few TVs they have are actually monitors, not HD TVs, and have no sound/closed captioning. Really sad.

Place needs some maintenance (ie soffit above bar is literally held together by duct tape).

Service @ the bar is OK but not great."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I keep going back to this location. The food is good, but it's not so great when it takes 45 minutes to get on a Tuesday night when my server only has 2 other tables. Then when we asked for the check it took another 20 minutes for that! Every single time I come here the service is either slow, or the servers are extremely passive and rude. I likely won't be coming back. The staff is lucky I am a server as well and believe in karma or else I would have left close to nothing for a tip."}
{"text":"I love, love, love their garlic edamame! I have had them at other sushi restaurants but nothing can compare! I wish they bottled their sauce!! Go during happy hour!!"}
{"text":"we went to eat here while visiting my hubby's brother. place looked great. you could say it's more of the 'hip' scene. the music playing through the speakers made us all want to go out and do karaoke [seriously, we went all over town trying to find a magic mic haha]. anyway, the food was good, not the best though, but their Las Vegas roll was absolutely delicious. oh and we all felt a bit under dressed, everyone there was dressed like they were at a club. 4 stars only because it took forever for them to bring our order out and there were barely customers there. our waiter was some guy, didn't get his name, but he was like so mellow. He barely came to check on us. i'm pretty sure they were waiting for us to get out because my daughter and niece pretty much were running around like the place was a playground :p 

-california rolls - ok
- rainbow roll - ok
- shrimp tempura roll - good
- las vegas roll - GREAT!
- mango lobster roll [?] not sure what it's called but i loved it and my husband, who's never had sushi before loved it too and even asked for another order of it :)
- green tea ice cream - yummy. no one can go wrong with that!

we pretty much spent over $100 bucks [during freakin happy hour, wtf]."}
{"text":"I had made an order through postmates and wasn't sure what to expect ordering sushi Togo . RA made sure it was perfect ! They made everything in their own little containers so nothing would get soggy , labeled everything so I would know what to put on top of what . Seriously the best to go sushi I have had ! Great job !"}
{"text":"Met friends here last night for restaurant week. The food was fantastic and the variety offered was a great value. They even included wine or sake. The lobster rolls were very good.
The only negative I found was the waiter had no idea what was on the restaurant week menu or how the whole deal worked. Once he figured it out, he did a nice job.
Amazing amount of food and drink for $30."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Kyle our server was super friendly. We were impressed that the manager came around and offered us desert on the house."}
{"text":"We returned by the request of Wade the General Manager.  He made sure everything was more than perfect.  We want to thank him for his professionalism and attention to detail.
We will return with our large group soon."}
{"text":"25 minutes no drink they brought the drink  I haved
 a spicy Margarita terrible send it back another half an hour for food stay away from this place go to sapporo's terrible what more can I say. Screwed the food order up to they sent salmon instead of tuna oh yeah I ordered ice cream another 20 minutes"}
{"text":"The Las Vegas is a mouth full you may not want to try to eat this if your on a first date.The service isn't great but, it's worth a try if your in the mood for sushi"}
{"text":"Nope. Sushi wasn't that great, service was meh, hostesses were meh, and patio seating...should be fully covered. Not much else to say other than, meh. Drive down the road and get better sushi with better service at a much better price. Nothing was bad, but if you're going to pay this much, you have better choices."}
{"text":"I love the RA chain, but this RA always has TERRIBLE SERVICE. I can't tell you how often my friends and I come here and are always trying to flag down our waitress despite the empty restaurant.

I love the food (decent sushi, good for groups, girlfriend dates), and happy hour is great! Also, their half birthday deal is amazing, but I come here instead of the better old town location because it's closer to my house.

Other than the service, the sushi chefs are nice and it's very clean. Oh, but I will note that a lot of the time when I walk in and stand in front of the hostess table, the hostess will be missing and I'll have to wait a long time before someone realizes I'm there... 

Cheap sushi, decent quality, bad service, but willing to come back b/c of convenience."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Service was pretty good. Host was at best average. It was odd that the items I ordered all came out first so my friend had to eat my food while waiting for her food. Then the one item she ordered came way later when she reminded the server. Green tea was odd tasting, like seaweed. Overall the experience was very average nothing memorable or worth mentioning."}
{"text":"Set inside kierland, the ambiance is good but it feels like your typical chain - good, but not special. There is a nice big patio which is great when there is nice weather and good for people watching!! The staff is always nice, no complaints.

RA has a great happy hour and reverse happy hour, one of the best around! The \"ra\"ckin shrimp is pretty tasty and very crunchy. I also like the chili ponzu yellowtail, although you can probably find better cuts elsewhere. The sushi never wows me, but it's good, I've never sent anything back, and I always leave full.

Overall, I don't come here for the best sushi in Phoenix, but I keep going back for the happy hour -it's totally worth it!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of chain restaurants but this place was pretty good. The lobster spring rolls were really good! We ordered 2 orders of it. I also wasn't a fan of my drink I ordered but I still drank it. My waiter took it off my bill which I wasn't expecting him to do- but that was pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Delicious lunch today!!! Spicy salmon bowl, chicken teriyaki bento box, zoni roll!!! Yummy"}
{"text":"The sushi at RA is beyond amazing!  I eat sushi about 3 times a week and if I could eat at RA evertime, I WOULD!  Happy Hour rocks and there's some really awesome stuff on the HH menu!  Absolutely love it!"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance of this place! They have comfortable seating, awesome decor, and nice lighting (not the kind for taking pics, but good for a chill night out).  It is great for date night or a girls night out. The service was great--our waitress was the sweetest!  As for the food, I ordered a specialty roll, the crazy monkey roll. Tbh, the sushi was pretty meh. Nothing really special about it but it was still aight. I'd be willing to come back and try another sushi roll or dish because I really liked the vibe of this place."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this restaurant after years of frequenting in the old location. We came here to celebrate a special occasion and sat on the patio. Our waiter was non-existent. We had to go up to the bar to get our own place settings. When we asked a manager about where our waiter went, he said he was being slammed in the inside. So, I guess we were not as important as the 'inside' customers....
The sushi was marginal. maguro on the sashimi plate tasted as though it was freezer burnt, and didn't taste right at all. Miso lacked any flavor at all. We finished our drinks before the main course came out and were never asked if we wanted more beer or sake. What waiter walks away from another bar charge?? 
Won't be coming back.... ever. If I could give this ZERO stars I would. Can I get back the last hour of my life?"}
{"text":"Great food great service. Happy hour and martini Monday's are a great deal. Sara was a very friendly server."}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend at like 10 pm for sushi which is awesome in the first place since so many places are closed by this time. This is open till 12 and the servers treat you just as well as if you came in at 8! Love when there's no hate for coming at a later time. So when I arrived we were able to choose to sit at a booth  and wre treated very kindly by the darker haired host. I tried the cucumber roll, nothing crazy. I just do vegetarian sushi and a side of white rice. Servers checked up frequently and I only paid like 8$ for this simple little late night snack. The ambiance was very busy and pretty loud for a Sunday night, however I loved it! I didn't get to try an happy hour options but looking at their HH menu I will have to come back asap! Thanks Ra"}
{"text":"Was on vacation nearby and just walked in with friends. The food was a real surprise.  We ordered some house rolls that were good, but the yellowtail sushi was the best. Worth a shot if your in the area."}
{"text":"Good but not great sushi,  happy hour make up for that, though.   A newer offering is the 4 dishes for $25.  For 2 people or a small group that's a pretty good deal.  Combine it with the happy hour sake and it's certainly worth the trip"}
{"text":"I'm fairly new to the sushi world..so I have had a lot of catching up to do over the last few years. I have tried SO many places and by far RA has been my favorite. Amazing food, affordable prices...especially the happy hour menu and the staff is so friendly and attentive. The manager Kearstin was so nice. She made us feel welcome and made sure everything was ok throughout our lunch. RA is my go to place for amazing sushi and service!"}
{"text":"Very good design and set up. Food is okay and the happy hour is pretty good. Service is solid as well."}
{"text":"Ive always enjoyed Ra, and I love the new location and environment since they left Kierland.

However, I feel like their quality has gone wayyy downhill.
I went there the other night and ordered a few specialty rolls. The rice was \"mucky\" and \"mushy\".
The scallop dynamite roll had more chunks of onions ontop than actual scallops. It was awful!
This is the 3rd time going there after the relocation that I have had less than stellar sushi. I probably wont be going back.

The other thing I would like to say and this goes out to the management..... I like to go and sit at the bar. Many people (usually women) want to place their purse, jacket, etc on an empty
bar stool to either \"save it\" or so someone wont sit next to them. This has happened several times when I have gone to RA. If people dont want people sitting next to them, Get a table! Management should take note that these folks that do this are taking up a PAYING CUSTOMERS spot! ANd puh-lease!! SItting at the bar is a fun way to make new friends!!"}
{"text":"I never was a fan of RA sushi, I guess I just wasn't ordering the right thing! 

But since they loved to their new location, we've been there many many times and I've enjoyed it every single time! 

Rolls are yummy, their appetizers are creative and delish. 

Great lunch specials and especially HAPPY HOUR! Definitely have been to several!!"}
{"text":"So disappointed, seriously some of the worst service I have had in a long time.  Food was good, as RA always is.  I frequently visit RA at other locations, first time I went to this one.  The service we received was the absolutely the worst tonight, it's Monday night at 7pm and hardly anyone there.  Waitress never stopped by to check on us after the food came out, which came out super quick but nothing past that.  Had the Hot Mess, would have been nice to get a refill on water too.  Had to flag her down to pay, so disappointed.  Tarnished my fondness of RA."}
{"text":"Asdfghjjkshsjxbsn ... woo saaaa ... I honestly don't know why I even bothered!! I thought new location so maybe new management/chefs? I guess not. 

I ordered a chicken teriyaki bowl. I can't eat rice so I asked for extra veggies and even gave the waiter suggestions. Basically just fill up my bowl with vegetables since I can't eat rice. Is that too much to ask for?? When my meal came oh I received extra veggies alright, which you ask? Carrots!! The bowl was full of carrots!!! What a friggin joke. The chicken might as well have just been a slab of meat as well - super awkward to eat.

I told the waiter I wasn't pleased when he asked how my meal was, and that it was just filled with all carrots... he said sorry and then asked me if he could bring me a side of broccoli or peppers.... uhhhh no.... but why couldn't you have just added that to my bowl??!!! Ughhh the logic is beyond me.

He offered me a coupon for a free roll or app for the next time I come in... thanks, but no thanks!"}
{"text":"I should put this out there: I go to RA a decent amount.  Their Ikura with quail egg and hot sake hits the spot, along with some other great menu options.  Furthermore, the service I've had has always been above par. 

However, my only problem with RA is the loud music.  I love club music and even going to clubs on occasion, but it would be nice if there was at least an area outdoors where the soundtrack didn't feel invasive---especially since I usually go there after work to kick-back.  Friends of mine have mentioned it to me, and we still go to RA for their awesome menu, but the experience would be 5 stars with some more mellow, toned-down tunes."}
{"text":"Loved the fresh sashimi here. Ordered the hamachi sashimi, lollipop roll, and lucky heart roll and all delish. Also had the Japanese mule which was really surprisingly good. My fiancé ordered two different kinds of wings and loved them.
We had great service and the place wasn't even that crowded on a Friday night around 8. We were seated as soon as we walked in. Will be back!"}
{"text":"I must admit that I am picky about sushi and I do not love chain restaurants. Living in Colorado, I had no idea RA was a chain...thank goodness. It was so yummy! Our server was amazing and we were her last table of the night."}
{"text":"If you like waiting for the bartender to chat with her friends while waiting to order after sitting for 8 minutes to be acknowledged you may enjoy this location. Especially if you like your food to be delivered to her other friend sitting next you on the other side while he eats it."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. Karen got fish tacos and I got the sushi & nigari entree. Absolutely delicious.  This is our first visit to the new totally hip location. Big improvement over the old place.
Spencer, our server, very friendly, fast and attentive. Ask for him when you come here. Because it was our first visit he comped an order of edanami."}
{"text":"This will be short and sweet.  Went on Friday night and waited to sit outside.  Was worth waiting for because of the weather.  Service was LAME.  The waiter was so incredibly slow/miserable/uninterested/checked out that it was painful to experience.  His first statement to us was that he couldn't bring us water or plates because he was waiting for them to be cleaned, but eventually we would get them.  But the food was great so I wasn't sure how to rate the place. (hence the 3 stars) Got several rolls, the potsticker soup, and some drinks.  All the food was good and the atmospere was cool as well.  I would go again because I hate to let yummy food go because of a coma induced waiter."}
{"text":"I feel like Ra is too focused on social and not sushi. Good for groups, and decent happy hour prices. Lots of cute waitresses too."}
{"text":"I rarely order a sushi roll that I don't like, but the Rainbow Roll left a little something to be desired. In the description it says it lays down avocado, shrimp, salmon and another fish to make it look like the colors of the rainbow. I thought this meant that every individual roll was going to have all this fish but it was just spread across the 8 rolls. The color of the fish was very bland and there wasn't even avocado slices on each roll. It in no way resembled a rainbow and even tasted more bland then it looked. I really enjoyed the nigiri though and our server was nice just not very attentive. It was pretty slow when we were there and I saw him just standing around talking to other employees. Which is fine cause I'm a server too but when your table needs something and you see your server just shooting the breeze instead of doing their job it's a little annoying. All in all it was an average experience, might come again and try their happy hour and some other rolls besides the rainbow one!"}
{"text":"Went in recently to see if service would be any better. It wasnt. We were there for an hour and a half and our server Katie checked up on us only twice, in the beginning and in the end. My friend wanted to return her food because it wasnt what she had gotten but by the time the server came back she had ate it all bcuz she was hungry.. 0_o Happy hour sucks, they took off the onion albacore tuna (my fav) and the veggie tempura. the two things i had came for in the first place! not only that but i feel like they raised the prices to make up for the happy hour prices. ull see all these weird prices like 480 or 710 scatted across the menu. ill go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We've been to Ra on N. Scottsdale several times over the last couple of months. While the food is always good, I have noticed a distinct problem with their customer service. We were at our table for about 15 minutes before our simple glass of wine arrived.  I watched the 2 male bartenders talking non-stop with each other (particularly the husky, shorter, bald guy) while my poor server kept checking back to the bar for our drinks. These 2 guys should have been immediately on all orders, but instead seemed to be having a deep discussion.
We like the happy hour too, but we probably won't go back again because of the extremely poor customer service."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly. Sushi was good. Nothing special about this place. I had the miso soup, edamame, and the GOJIRA ROLL: Shrimp tempura, crab mix, cream cheese and cucumber rolled and topped with spicy tuna and green tempura bits; served with Sriracha and spicy mayo. 
They didn't have a lot of specialty roll options, but overall everything was good. I would go again, but it wouldn't be my first choice. 5 starts for the food and staff."}
{"text":"Located in Kierland Commons, RA is in a great location to dine outside, with a view of the sky high, beautifully lit palm trees and the surrounding action of shoppers and foodies.  On the off chance that the weather isn't Scottsdale-Spectacular, or you love the indoor experience, the ambiance inside is wonderful and alive, as well.  The edamame is a must to enjoy while you're waiting for your sushi.  I always order the King Crab Rolls, since I love the avocado inside, with the cucumber and crab. As with any restaurant in Kierland Commons, parking close can be a challenge, however there is a large parking lot a block to the south, and a large lot and parking garage a few blocks to the north...and after all, walking within this quaint area is part of the experience."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been to new location. Terrible & slow service every time. Took almost 45 minutes to get a bento box?!? The excuse was they have only 2 cooks hire more people!!!!"}
{"text":"Sushi is good. We enjoyed the happy hour specials.

The new location is better than the previous on at Kierland Commons.

The service was solid."}
{"text":"I was with a mixed group of sushi lovers and sushi newbies.  Ra was a great choice to cater to all.  

Atmosphere was loud and lively.  The restaurant was very dark - could barely make out the menus.  Lots of outside seating as well.  The place was PACKED but luckily we managed to snag a table.  

We ordered family style, including spicy tuna rolls, seaweed salad, the Viva Las Vegas, soft-shell crab rolls, tempura, chicken teriyaki, and a few other things that I can't remember.  Even the sushi newbies loved all the sushi items!  They were also turned on to Asahi.  

Our waitress graciously split the bill evenly 7 ways with 7 credit cards and no attitude.  Total came to about $27 each, which was a very reasonable price.    

Would come back next time I'm in town....."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised, as this is our first time here. All the staff are friendly and the service is excellent! The food was so fresh and delicious! We were very happy to be eating such fresh fare! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Got together here with some friends for my birthday a while back.  They were easy to set a reservation with completely online.  Some of the group showed up late and there was a pushy group waiting for a table behind us but they made sure we still got our place in line.  The food was great and came out quick and the server had no problem splitting the tab several ways.  Definitely will continue to come back"}
{"text":"We did not like this place at all.
I don't understand why it was so busy.

The sushi is mediocre and bland.
The cucumber sunomono salad was bizarrely sweet and lemony.
The only dish I actually enjoyed was the kimchi dressed salad.

The service was okay and the establishment was clean.
I would never eat here again."}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been here quite a bit and every time is amazing! Went here for lunch at around 1 in the afternoon and had amazing service! Wasn't too busy and our food came out super quick! I'm talking less than 5 minutes after we ordered it! The spicy tuna roll is a classic must have and the viva Las Vegas roll is something everyone should try! I wanted to try something different so I got the Zonie Roll and it was amazing! Wasn't as spicy as it sounds which makes it ten times better! Definitely cannot wait to go back here to try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and it's still one of our go to sushi spots. The food is always very consistent and delicious. They have great happy hour and very reasonable prices. The new location has a great out door patio with large garage doors that open up to the inside. Perfect place to grab some sushi!"}
{"text":"Came here this weekend for a Sushi and Sake 101 class. It was really fun! Learned how to make California rolls and nigiri and sampled some sake. I have never tried their menu items but enjoyed eating the sushi they taught me how to make! I'll be back for happy hour."}
{"text":"Ra. Is Blah
And the peeps. Give me the creeps.
 Service? Makes me nervous. 
The vibe. Just don't jibe.
 Just not my scene. I'm a picky queen. 
Don't like the snotties. Acting all haughty.
Sake bombers cheap and good. Only reason I would.
Go to Ra.
Blah Blah Blah."}
{"text":"PROMOTE YOUR OWN BENEFIT !!

You are doing a wonderful thing for the Yarnell firefighters and 100 Club of Arizona.  I stopped in July 12th and there was no sign in the restaurant that told customers about this benefit.  The bartenders, waiters and servers said NOTHING about it.  So, for those of you reading this on Saturday, July 13th please stop in.  RA Sushi will donate 100 percent of the profits from all menu items sold to the 100 Club of Arizona for its Survivors Fund in memory of the Granite Mountain Hotshots.. Profits from all of RA Sushi's dine-in food items, beverages and alcohol will be included in the fundraiser, in addition to all take-out orders."}
{"text":"Similar experience at pretty much every Ra location. The sushi is excellently prepared, excellently plated, generously portioned and, for the most part, fair value for the money.

Like every Ra location, the service is spotty, hit and miss.

Best value: the sashimi entree. You don't get to pick the selection, but compared to individually priced nigiri, the value is there. It comes with one cup of miso soup which is meh.

Skip the beef short rib bowl. $15 is over priced. And, it's beef, not pork. And, it's very fatty and tough as nails. Biggest mistake next to the Ra chips 'n salsa mash up.

Still going to be a regular. They have the best sushi in town. Just have to know what to order - and what to skip - and put up with servers who don't always care about anything."}
{"text":"Just OK. Not anywhere that I would say I'd crave going to. The server we had was nice and quick with refills, but the overall food would only be worth it for Happy Hour."}
{"text":"Walked over here from the Kierland Westin Resort.

There was no wait when we arrived and they hostess was very friendly. 

The decor was nice and fit the place pretty well. They had a DJ playing music until closing. The music was a good touch!

We came here on a Sunday night around 8:30 so we were able to catch their happy hour menu. Which had a lot of appetizers and rolls for almost 40% original price. 

The chicken yakitori was delicious! The chicken was so moist and tender. The rainbow, spicy salmon and California roll were good too. The spicy salmon definitely had a spicy kick to it. We also go the sweet potatoes and asparagus tempura, the sweet potatoe was really yam. The slices of \"sweet potatoe\" were so thick it wasn't great. The asparagus was good on the other hand. The pork gyoza was yummy too! I'm getting hungry just thinking about the gyoza. 

Don't get the grilled short ribs whatever you do, they were burnt and fatty. I took a bite and spit it back on my plate because it was chewable. 

But pretty good sushi."}
{"text":"I've been craving sushi way too often lately. This place, conveniently located next to the Westin, was a pleasant surprise when it popped up on our Yelp map while we were roaming for sushi.

The ambiance will leave an impression on you. The room is lit by a pleasant glow of red light and we instantly felt welcomed and excited to start our meal.

Garlic Edamame, Edamame dip, and Pepper Shishito are a must. 

We mostly ordered nigiri, and were satisfied with everything they put down on the table. Highlights include eel, salmon, octopus, and sweet egg. All worth a try if you have the appetite.

Distinguishing factor: Chic decor, accentuated by the glowing red globes on the ceiling."}
{"text":"So I feel like I might be a little harsh....but I came from San Diego and have had high quality fish and better service at a lot more places. Let me get started. 
When we showed up for reverse happy hour on a weeknight I had a reservation which I showed up ready to announce to the host. We stood there for 4 minutes before the bartender actually asked if we planned on sitting, I said yes so he said he would go find someone to help us. After getting our hostess, I informed her of our dinner reservation and that we were there for happy hour. She then sat us without a happy hour menu and gave us an ordering sheet to fill out....without a pen or pencil.
Not off to a good start RA. Might I add I've always been a little against commercial sushi restaurants, and so far...this was reinforcing the reasons why.
BUT the server we then had was amazing! Very sweet and attentive, always asking if we needed anything else and if we had any questions. 
....The food was okay. 
I had ordered a yellowtail roll and spicy salmon roll, both were fishy tasting. More than any other place in Scottsdale that I've tried. 
My boyfriend I really enjoyed the Zonie roll, which was my favorite and the Las Vegas roll which was my boyfriends and I must say, has a great presentation.
If you plan on coming here, sign up for their \"hooked up\" email list and get new menu updates as well as free gift cards. 
I won't be returning, try the sushi at stingray across the street at Scottsdale Quarter."}
{"text":"Happy Hour 4pm-7pm is the PERFECT time to dine at RA for sushi. Should you decide to dine at RA.

3 gals with an alcoholic bev and enough rolls to roll us home and the total bill was $41 and change.  This was a nice bargain.

BUT.... the 2 stars state it perfectly \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"  That pretty much says it all.  The sushi was okay.  Nothing special that makes me want to go back, so I probably won't unless I am shopping in Kierland and must eat a sushi roll but that probably won't happen. 

Service was good.  It was that blah sushi. 2 stars.  With plenty of good sushi in town, they gotta step it up.  Do you think they do better sushi before or after happy hour like are they thinking \"ha, it's happy hour and that cheap-skate wants good sushi?!  ha ha ha\"-- I don't know.  But I'm sticking to my other sushi hot spots."}
{"text":"Saw Alice Cooper here at lunch a couple weeks ago.

Food was good, too.  :)  But 5-stars for having one of the coolest customers ever!"}
{"text":"There happy hour is pretty decent- half off a number of items.  Very crowded when I came- Friday at about 6.  They said 20 minute wait, but it was much less than that.  We were able to get seated on the patio which is where I wanted to be anyways.  Food was great- tasty, fresh, good sauces, etc.  Service was very fast and efficient.   Don't really have any complaints, except maybe build a bigger patio here."}
{"text":"My hubby and I had a delightful lunch today !  For Mothers Day all day was Happy Hour!  No better gift!  We shared the Tuna Tataki, the Garlic Ponzu Yellowtail and two rolls!  The sauces on the Tuna and Yellowtail were out of this world. Plus the price was right at HH. We also shared a Salmon Bento. It was generous and tasty!  I just wish the HH drink specials were the same. No great deals on Wines by the glass. Boohoo!"}
{"text":"Very good sushi,the atmosphere is dark,which makes for a fun experience,you don't feel like you are at just any other restaurant. Good service & drinks."}
{"text":"Hello Yelp'ers,

Came here today while I was at a conference and had some drinks with my team. 

They had a GREAT happy hour and good drinks.  

however, my big complaint was the mens restroom.  While some good decorations, it stunk to high hell.  Really killed my happy hour mood due to the stench. 

Went back to the hotel to commence drinks. 

Happy yelping,"}
{"text":"**This food is for takeout/delivery only**

I've ordered takeout/delivery a number of times from RA and never really been impressed. The sushi won't make you sick but it's not the best quality fish and often doesn't taste that great. That doesn't stop me from ordering it every once in a while when everywhere else is closed on a Sunday night (they are usually open until 12am). 

The sushi rice is a bit sweet but it at least is properly seasoned with vinegar. I've had some okay sushi as well as complete misses from here - for example, my most recent poke bowl was filled with sloppily sliced cuts of tuna and salmon, with the skin still showing and sections of stringy connective tissue, rendering the fish tasted inedible. I would stick to cooked foods overall at RA rather than mediocre sashimi. I don't think it's worth trying unless you're really craving sushi and everywhere else is closed.!"}
{"text":"Ra boasts a fine happy hour.  The seaweed salad is fabulous and the rolls are sufficient.  Like the rest of the area, the scene at this location is full of cougars and trouts.  The patio area is nice and offers a view of Kierland's shopping area.    Stingray at Scottsdale Quarter is also open and Sapporo is nearby as well....."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars!
Great place for a first time date or a night out with friends!
Happy hour menu is amazing, food is always good, staff mostly friendly but give them a passing B ;)
Best part is RA's location, great for a walk after wards if you're on your first date."}
{"text":"So, after the assplosion, I think I'd better write my review!
Sucked as soon as we walked in.  Party of 5.  Approximately 1pm.  Not busy.  2 four-top and one 2-top tables empty, plus the sushi bar.  They said it would be a 20-minute wait for us to get a bigger table.  We suggested just taking a 4-top.  Ended up that the co-owner of my company pushed two tables together and Voila!  We were seated.  
Drink order got taken quickly.  Our waitress, Sarah, hated us from moment one.  Got our drinks, placed our orders.  I've never waited so long for sushi!
I had the tempura box lunch special, and everyone got a bunch of sushi dishes to taste.  One girl is allergic to gluten, so ordered hers wrapped in soy paper.  It came wrapped in rice.  The waitress also claimed that they don't wrap their sushi in cucumber.  Huh?  I've never been anywhere that DOESN'T wrap in cucumber instead of rice.  Luckily, we took the plate to the sushi chef and he re-did it with the soy paper.  It was a WAY smaller serving than the original.
She was great about refilling our drinks, but just wasn't as friendly (meaning not at ALL) as any other server I've ever had.
This place sucks ball and I won't be back.
Now, Back to the assplosion..."}
{"text":"I had the rainbow roll, yellowtail and stripped bass.  All of it was awesome!
Very fresh and the service was great. I'm visiting but I would come back here."}
{"text":"Its a good place to go for happy hour. Good drink specials as well as inexpensive appetizers.  If you are in the North Scottsdale area I would suggest going and sitting on the patio and doing a little people watching and enjoying some sushi and drinks."}
{"text":"Why, why, why?  Oh right, because it was my niece's 16th birthday and this is where she wanted to go.  The rolls were sloppy, the fish could have been fresher and the service was a little slow and inattentive.   The fish isn't cheap and there's not even a whole lot of character.  Thank god I'm not 16."}
{"text":"Stopped in with the hubby for happy hour- Goes from 3-7 I believe. They had a pretty good selection. We ordered a bunch of different rolls and appetizers, but what stood out to me was the Vegas Roll and calamari roll. Both delicious you won't be disappointed. Vegas roll was very generous in size, and the calamari roll had an amazing eel sauce.  
Staff was very friendly and polite, the only thing that threw us off was our appetizers came after our rolls? Then and the last roll came well after we were ready for a check. 
No big deal since it was happy hour but if It happened while I was out for dinner, I'd be annoyed."}
{"text":"This was our second time here, but we mainly returned because I had a coupon.  Even with the coupon however, it was too pricey for what we got.  The server was fine- not too friendly, but did his job.  We started with pineapple cheese wontons which ended up being the highlight of the whole meal.  Next we had the tunacado, the scallop dynamite roll and the chili ponzu yellowtail.  They were all just average- which is really what I feel about this whole restaurant- its just average.  To top it off the restaurant was freezing!  I know its hot outside, but everyone in the place was cold and they did not bother turning the air down as we requested.  There are better places -even in Arizona-for the same price or even less."}
{"text":"Food was great! Service was the worst I've experienced in a long time. So disappointed. 

I went here with my friends last night for HH. I've been to RA before but tonight I had my $20 gift certificate for my half bday. I love this! I used this last year and couldn't wait to do it again. The Vegas roll is amazing! Now to the service. I initally sat inside but when my friends arrived we went out to the patio. The male server who brought me my drink inside was great! When we went outside and had a new server everything went down hill. First the server only brought us 1 menu for a table of 3 people. We had to ask for the HH menu and she dropped it down and walked away. When we ordered I asked if she could leave the HH menu there in case we wanted to order more drinks and she got an attitude with me (wasn't the first time) and told me she needed to make room on the table so she took it from me. I've noticed that the last couple of times I go to RA they leave the wasbi off of the sushi plates and I have to request for it when i receive my rolls. I had to do this last night and she again responded with an attitude and walked away. She never asked if we wanted refills. She was upset when I was trying to explain who was going to pay what with our cards. She came back with our cards she handed my check to me and mispronounced my name purposely (it's Jaime) so...  gave her my gift certificate and it seemed like the total owed was off she ignored us when we tried to call her over. She looked straight at us and kept walking. I just paid and left. I have no clue why she was in such a bad attitude but it's ashamed because I love the food and she made our experience horrible. Never going back there again and I'm going to vocalize our experience to my friends (at least not at that location)."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this RA on a very regular basis and absolutely loved it. Always received great service and was seated in a timely manner (even during rush time) 
I just went here with a girlfriend a couple of Fridays ago and it was awful. I would give it one star except I'm hoping this might be a one time thing however many signs indicated it is not. 
The wait was AT LEAST 30 minutes long, thinking it was worth it we waited, saw some friends and they got sat at a table large enough for us all to sit together so we only waited about 20. We were sat outside after being told there were misters to keep us cool. the misters were about 9 ft high and pointing in the wrong direction so we all sat there in an uncomfortable humid state of sweat. 
We asked multiple times for extra menus and place settings and did not get them until AFTER our food was served. No soy sauce on the table had to wait for that too. My friend and I ordered sake bombers and they gave us water glasses instead of bomber glasses...they said they kept breaking so they don't provide them anymore. What kind of sushi restaurant does not have the appropriate glasses for bombers? They must be really struggling financially. 
Our server was dull and unenthusiastic, no desire to please. Asked for more water and got it about 15 minutes later. If I wasn't enjoying the company so much I probably would have lost it and asked to speak to a manager. Server also didn't get my friends order right and so they didn't get one of the rolls they ordered until we were almost finished eating. Also they took away the mushrooms in the veggie tempura one of my fav items, big bummer for me. 
We didn't dare order desert even though we wanted it. All of us are very good tippers and we couldn't even decide if this server deserved a tip. We ended up leaving 15% instead of 20-25%. I considered that very generous. 
There are way too many new sushi restaurants that contend with RA or are better for me to have any desire to go back again. I wouldn't be surprised if this location shut down if they keep up that quality of service."}
{"text":"Went here for reverse happy hour with some friends.  Never been a huge fan of Ra considering I feel there are other better sushi restaurants around, but the majority wanted to go here so I went.  Definitely good happy hour prices but still not all that great.  I ordered for the hubby and I:  the chicken wings, tootsie maki roll, Ra-ukin Shrimp and korean bbq short ribs.  

I honestly don't have a lot to say about this place because there is nothing sticking out of my mind.  For all of that, my bill came to $33 including an 18% gratuity."}
{"text":"I love ra and have been here many times and many locations. This ra has the worst service of all! We had to ask for our server multiple times and usually do at this location. This was a Friday night and there were tons of open tables. The worst part is that they were out of fried ice cream.. The whole reason we went to Ra instead of a different sushi place. The server did nothing. I am sorry but you shouldn't be out of your desserts on a Friday night and there's clearly something wrong with this location since it was empty on a Friday night and every other ra you go to is packed beyond belief. We will be going to the other locations from now on."}
{"text":"Ra is a restaurant that I go to often but never Yelp about for some reason. That will change today! My favorite things on the menu are the garlic edamame and kind crab roll. I order this every time I go there. The service is consistently good, food comes out quick and it's prepared well, the wait staff is professional and attentive. This is one of my favorite sushi restaurants to go to. It is also a fun place to get drinks at before you go out. Great vibe!"}
{"text":"First time since they moved out of Kierland. Sat at the bar and the service was great. Service gets 5 stars.  Was good sushi. Not the best I've ever had- only reason I'm giving it 4 stars. I'd recommend but I think Kona Grill has an edge over RA."}
{"text":"I took off two stars because of cleanliness. We arrived and sat outside, the chairs had bird poop on them. The dishes all had stains on them. I expected a lot more from RA. The only reason it has 3 stars is the service, everyone was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"The menu changes every now and then.  Sometimes it's awesome and sometimes the rolls really blow.  The staff is half snobby, half cool.  I always avoid the hostess station as much as possible.  Bartenders are generally nice.  Decor is great and sitting outside is fun.  It's pricey and you're paying to be there just as much as you are paying for the rolls.  I wouldn't go there more than a few times a year."}
