{"text":"The food here is amazing, which is why it gets 4 stars. It is by far the best sushi i've had. The problem is the service, staff is friendly but they always, without fail make mistakes with our orders. I was once served sushi with meat in it (i'm vegetarian). We always get at least one of our dishes wrong, which is frustrating."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant Vietnamien, un service courtois et chaleureux! Les rouleaux printaniers sont succulents! En fait, tout ce que nous avons dégusté fut excellent! On y retourne? C'est certain!"}
{"text":"I rate this restaurant 4.5 on 5. The ambiance is great for a dinner date or just a night out with friends. It's really clean, and the staff is kind & thoughtful. The food tasted amazing and pretty healthy ,I had 2 sushi rolls & 2 salads, a dessert and tea for 27$. It's also bring your own wine!! We all love those :) I went on a Friday night so it took me about 10 mins to find parking, so factor that in when you're on your way there."}
{"text":"Fine contemporary Vietnamese cuisine in this upscale neighborhood restaurant. Specializes in Spring Rolls and has a separate specialized menu for it. I recommend their table d'hote menu and selecting the spring roll combo plate if available, on first visit. The table d'hote comes with a soup, an appetizer, the main entree, and a small dessert (about $23). All professionally and artistically presented and prepared. Lovely Asian flavorings. My Wonton soup was amazing with its ginger broth!"}
