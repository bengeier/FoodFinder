{"text":"I come here for lunch quite often and love the food.  I often get the befana meal which is two pieces of  beef, fries and salad at a great price, also the fish fillets are delicious.  I have also catered there Portuguese chicken, rice and little potatoes which are delicious and also well priced.   They just switched to new ownership, I hope the quality and pricing stay the same."}
{"text":"The first time I popped in here was after a meal down the street.  We were just looking to satisfy our sweet tooths.  Ola Bakery has lots of little snack-sized cakes to choose from and, of course, Portuguese tarts!  While there, we realized they also serve lunch.

Today we came to see what their lunch was all about.  Ola appears to be a popular lunch spot.  The restaurant area was about three quarters full the whole time we were there.  Plus there were several take-out customers coming in and out.

Their menu is fairly simple.  You can choose a half-chicken or quarter chicken with your choice of two sides (rice, potatoes, fries or salad).  You can also order a whole chicken to go for $9.99.  For sandwiches you can build your own by choosing your bread and meats, or if decision-making isn't your forte then they also offer a veal sandwich.  The sandwiches don't come with sides and are priced around $6 each.  The quarter chicken was also priced at $6 and comes with the two sides.  

I went for the veal sandwich because I was very excited to try their bread.  Their bread seems to be one of their best-selling products (just based on the customers I saw coming in and out and what they feature on their website).  The bun for the sandwich was gigantic, but the meat was rather thin.  The tomato-based sauce was good, but I wish there was more of it.  With so much bread, it was rather dry.  The sandwich also comes with cheese.  Some bites of the veal were actually tough.  I also ordered a small side of fries.  They weren't too greasy and perfectly crispy.  I would have liked to try their potatoes, but they didn't have any today.  I only managed to finish half of the sandwich and all my fries.  The portion was gigantic!

They have a whole chalkboard of espresso beverages to choose from and an interesting variety of fruit juices and nectars.  If I had any room left, I would have gone home with a Portuguese tart.  They looked very flaky.

Ola is a family-run business.  There appeared to be lots of regulars who knew the family very well, obviously long-time customers.  My only complaint is that the service was a little slow, so it's more of a sit-and-chat-and-stay place than an eat-and-run place.  

Great value.  Very friendly atmosphere.  I will return to try some of their take-out items like their chicken and potatoes, freshly baked breads and pastries or their grocery items such as coffee or piri piri sauce."}
{"text":"First time I took my BF there he loved there beef and bread and Portuguese bread and can't for get the beer and we are for sure going back we all loved it good food and friendly staff"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for pasteis de nata, was put onto this gem by our Portuguese friends. So delicious!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Sunday morning breakfast and fresh coffee hangout in Oakville. It has authentic European atmosphere and their cakes are as sweet as the lovely young couple that own it."}
{"text":"A great place for some good Portuguese comfort food. Very simple place, with excellent quality food."}
{"text":"We had a very bad experience with the food. We find a bug in the salad but the worse part was that staff were super rude expecting us to pay for the food that we sent back because it had bug in it. The fiah fillet was  also not fresh. It seemed that it was cooked in the morning and it qas just microwaved before it was served. The pastry is not bad but i would not go there for the food."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch once, and it was so awkward that there were limited options comparing to what we saw on the menu online. If Ola had a social media or website posting today's special, it would be more convenient. 
So my boyfriend had BBQ chicken with salad and fries for sides and I had the pork chops with salad and fries. The food itself was not bad for my boyfriend but I didn't fall in love with the pork chops at all because I felt like the meat was too well done and a bit cold. 

The desserts on the other hand is a different story. The lady offered us freshly baked sweet buns (literally out of the oven) and it was really delicious! I loved the crispiness on the outside and smooth and soft on the inside and the cinnamon was a good touch. 
The egg custard tart was the best!!! My boyfriend and I took 12 of them home!

The price was extremely good so I cannot really complain about this place. 
I saw a lot of people going in and out buying breads and pastries, so I know for a fact this place puts more effort in their pastries. The owner of this place was very nice so the customer service was satisfactory. 

Overall, Ola is the best option as a cafe having desserts and coffee/tea but I wouldn't recommend here for lunch; I will try the sandwiches next time though. 

For one visit for lunch, I'd give 3.5 out of 5 stars but the desserts are definitely 5 out of 5 stars."}
