{"text":"I give a 2 because the portion sizes are microscopic. I mean lean cuisine worthy. The food itself was good. I got the pad woonsen lunch special and was expecting more than just a big scoopful of food. The egg rolls weren't that good. My noodles were all sogged together in a brick and I had to tear them apart to eat them but they were still good. Overall, I'm not impressed with this place. Maybe if we got more for our money it'd be worth it. But we will be going back to Golden Flower on Russell because their lunch specials are great and their food is amazing."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, which was right on schedule. I couldn't even finish the food though. Maybe at the restaurant it would be good but by the time it got to us the pad Thai was all stuck together, had no flavor and the meat was squishy. The battered shrimp/veggies were way more batter than meat/veggie. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Super fast delivery!! Food was pretty good too. The online ordering made things easy. Picking the level of spice for orange chicken was new to me but it was very good. There was a $2.00 delivery charge.
I will be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Really good food, relatively inexpensive.  All of the thai/chinese options you would expect."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, my experience at Bangkok 9 was mediocre at best. I had the Pad Thai and Kra Pow Chicken. The pad thai was a bright orange, as if it was drowned in food coloring, with little flavor and rubbery chicken. It also came with only 2 shrimp which was a major disappointment. I ended up adding my own sauces and seasonings before finally eating it. As for the Kra Pow chicken, the chicken looked stale, however, it did not taste as bad as it looked.
this was not my first time at Bangkok 9, and had pleasant experiences in the past. However, with this latest experience, i do not think I will be back there ever again."}
{"text":"The service, was attentive, I'll give them that, but do I really need my water re-filled after every drink??  

Moving on to the food, The Pad Thai was just not good, barely any veggies, no taste, good portion, but NO thanks.  I forgot what my friend ordered, but he wasnt pleased either and both of us will not be going back."}
{"text":"Wonderful Thai food! Service is exceptional and food comes out hot and quick. They box your food up for you when finished and my water glass was never more than half empty! I had the hot #1 dish and have also had the Bangkok 9 deep fried chicken with garlic sauce. Chicken was moist and the dishes were full of flavor. Fried chicken was lightly battered and the sauce was thin and light. The hot#1 chicken curry dish was spicy and robust. Definitely my favorite Thai food for a fantastically low price!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for several years, always delicious and friendly. The long time waitress always remembers what we order. Curries are amazing; the pad thai changed alittle when somebody new started working in the kitchen but its still good. One of the best places for thai around Vegas."}
{"text":"There are not enough great things to say about this place....it is awesome! The owner Michael is super friendly and always out and about in the restaurant chatting with guests...it gives you that warn kind of homey kind of feeling....the food is always phenomenal and the service by Rachel and the other servers is always top notch...your water glass will never even come close to being empty (my ultimate pet peeve)...and they remember the little things about your order the next time you come in to dine...no lemon in my water...extra spicy noodles...or the fact that I like TWO fortune cookies when I leave...they always remember...and I love that!! The combo of great food AND great service is hard to come by...so kudos to Bangkok 9....I heart you!"}
{"text":"Great food. Yellow chicken curry was great!  Beef salad has a nice flavor.  Fresh food and taste great."}
{"text":"Ok... So here I go... Pretty good overall!  Pad Thai usually is safe but last night was a little on the bland side.  I ordered ahead and asked her to make me something with string beans and beef, the result is what you see in the pic!  It was DELICIOSO!!!!! Omg my mouth watered with every bite and the spices set the back of head on F I R E!!!! ( THIS GIRL IS ON FIReeeerrrrr lol ). Back to the pad Thai chicken... so far the best in this part of Hendo I've tasted.  Speedy.  Polite!!! And clean! ORDER UP!"}
{"text":"Yellow curry is my favorite and I always get a Thai iced tea to wash it down.  Delivery speed is average, 45-60 minutes."}
{"text":"This is the closest place to us and we'd rather drive for Thai...if they tells you a little. We eat here in a crunch, but the shrimp tastes like it's been frozen and over cooked and the menu is large and confusing...there are better places! But you won't get sick and the food isn't awful- as long as you don't get seafood!"}
{"text":"Food was meh, service wasn't bad they were fast and checked up often beside that it was nothing special. Ordered the pad see ew and green curry and both were subpar at best. Also got the crab fried rice which was good and they used real crab meat and not imitation."}
{"text":"Our regular Thai place was closed. Not my favorite.  Nice people but food a bit blah"}
{"text":"I ordered curry and crab rice. Curry is really good. If you like spice, it's a good choice. The crab rice us not as good. I felt the crab is not the fresh. But it's not bad either. What I really don't like is that the place is not that clean and confortable... I probably would not come again."}
{"text":"I love this place. The best time to go is during lunch for the special. What I love about this place is its character. The food is good but not great. However that is not why I like the place. It just has a special feel about it that makes it authentic while not having everything dressed up in Thai attire. You wont regret your decision to eat here!"}
{"text":"I always order for delivery. LOVE THEIR FOOD!! Tom yum soup is delicious!! :))) they always say that the ETA is an hour or 40 mins but they arrive within 15-25 minutes !"}
{"text":"Love the Wor Wonton hot pot soup with everything including the kitchen sink.  Excellent pot-stickers.   Service is always good, I like the family run atmosphere.

We always seem to just have the soup, it's good every time.  The other dishes look and smell good, next time we have try something different."}
{"text":"Had their fried rice and my boyfriend let me try his pad thai. It was amazingly flavorful, they know how to use there spices. This place is legit."}
{"text":"Food arrived in 45 min which was expected. Nothing arrived hot except the soup was \"warm\". Sweet and sour chicken was maybe 8 pieces of chicken with a bunch of peppers, swimming in sauce. Will not order again"}
{"text":"I will not return. Went off reviews, gave it a shot. The food came out so quick, tasteless, noodles were rubber. It was so bad we didn't even eat it. They asked how it was, we told them but they didn't really seem to care we were not satisfied.  The beer was good! Had the Pad Thai and Curry fried rice."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited 3 times.  The first time was good--hot, spicy and well-priced. The second time was not as good.  Last week we decided to give it another try and we will not be back.  My main complaint is that the soup is goopy.  They put way too much corn starch in the broth.  The cashew chicken, which I ordered, was listed as slightly spicy.  Really?  It was very bland and lukewarm.  Though the meal was inexpensive (lunch for 2 people with tip, $20),--three strikes, you're out."}
{"text":"Very nice greeter and waitress. The food was pretty good. I wish the red curry had a little more shrimp and less bamboo and carrots."}
{"text":"Disappointed. The noodles in the chow mein were no more than plain spaghetti noodles.  Nothing had that great of quality. The cashew chicken was alright but I've had much better.. Everything was just ok, don't think we'll be trying again"}
{"text":"When Opening the Door it had that grimy look with wall-paper peeling off the walls and the Health Inspection rating Hiding somewhere. I ordered the Pineapple Fried Rice with Shrimp, Cashews and Chicken.
A rather Bland dish with a couple of Overcooked Shrimp and did I mention Tasteless. The Egg-Drop soup was possibly some of the thickest I've ever had. I understand that at one time this was an excellent place to eat, however since both locations have been re-inspected from their 'C\" Health inspections I think the owners have lost heart and no longer care about the survival of these places."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting.  Ive been here before and it was good. I just tried it again and got pad thai. The chicken was old and smelled and the shrimp was overcooked and not cleaned. I will never return and wouldn't recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times and it has changed hands but is always great-- service and food are as good as any Thai I've ever had. All the curries are good, the larb, spicy mint dishes, and my new fav is eggplant delight --all good choices.The sauces are broth like, not thick and gravy like. I can't comment on their Chinese food--I always order Thai."}
{"text":"I ordered Thai food to be delivered to my home yesterday.  I have to say delivery was quick but I was disappointed they did not read my notes to make my soup spicy.  It does change the whole taste of the Coconut soup if spice is not added. Chili pepper sauce was put in my delivery but not the powder pepper spice which was needed to add to my dishes since they did not add my spice. I will still order again for delivery because food is good, but will try to make it a point to spice up my food please.  I like it spicy hot.  I had the Green Curry also which was excellent just not spicy enough. The mango sticky rice should never be ordered for home delivery it was terrible waste of $4."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I have been hunting for a good thai restaurant, and i finally found it like half a mile from my work. First off ... the food is awesome, highly recommend! Second .. the service. Girl who took my order over the phone was great, explained the dishes to me making sure i got what i wanted. When i arrived, she told me my order was almost ready and offered me a water (hot las vegas afternoon). I declined, but then she offered me a sweet iced tea with cream, i could not decline, and it was delicious. Will order that next time for sure. Third ... as i had ordered a takeout, was surprised how busy it was inside at 4 in the afternoon, but i guess that is representative of the food. Will be going back here often."}
{"text":"I've been going to this location for a few years and I've been served consistent dishes and I'm always pleased with the service. Even if you want to sit for an hour just drinking tea and talking after a meal they don't seem to rush you out.

The Pad See Ew and Pad Thai are my go to dishes, and they always taste great. Just add a little chili sauce (conveniently placed right on the table for you) if you want more heat."}
{"text":"So this was the place for to go! I used to work at family christian store right next to it. They memorized my name and order!! This is that place where you get your fortune cookie and it always came true. Well at least for my family it has. Their pad thai! And pineapple fried rice and walnut shrimp!! Oh man watch out."}
{"text":"Great food, great friendly staff and good prices.  I go here about once a week and have never had a bad meal.  There hot n sour soup is the best."}
{"text":"Best food ever & service is amazing :) if in the area this is a must go !! Chicken won ton salad wraps yummy beyond words  !! Love this place !!"}
{"text":"Been going here for over 12 years.  Been getting hit and miss food for the last few years.  Tonight though was the worst.  Ordered Tom Ka Gai, Pad Thai, Panang Curry, and a tall beer to share with my son.  We both love Thai food and were hungry.  When the waitress brought the Tom Ka Gai, I noticed it only had coconut base, chicken, and mushrooms.  We we tasted it, it was awful, seriously awful flavorless swill.  I asked the waitress where the golanga root, chilies, etc where and she replied that this is how they always do it.  Um, sorry but after eating here, I know that it is most certainly NOT how they do it, or at least USED to do it.  She took it back to the kitchen and returned with a portion of equally awful soup less the two bowls we had dumped out from the first round,  Seriously?  I told her it was still bad and to cancel the other food that we would pay for the beer.  The chef was yelling in the kitchen about our cancellation, but I will not pay for inedible food and the was really bad.  So, tonight was the last straw.  I will not be back.  I am sad since it used to be pretty darn good."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat. Food was excellent.  Not unless we were hungry. Definitely will come back here when we are in the area."}
{"text":"I love the Tom Yum soup here. Just wish they would add more seafood in there. Its not enough for me. Just about 9 pieces of shrimp. But the service is a awesome. The owner and the employees are so nice. Its close to home and we frequently go. Love it."}
{"text":"I have eaten here for lunch and for dinner and have even called in orders and taken there food home. I enjoy it every time the food is always good. Prices are great and you never go away hungry. The people are always friendly and thankful. Will be back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing.  we come here almost once a week.  the servers and everyone are always so friendly.  the pad Thai and Walnut shrimp are always so good.  we absolutely love coming here!"}
{"text":"Whenever I get back into town from traveling, the first place we go is Bangkok 9 or we order delivery. It's delicious and just feels like home. We have been going to this restaurant for over 8 years and bringing friends and family to try all the curry and other dishes. No one is ever disappointed. It's always friends, comfortable, and just like we remembered it."}
{"text":"I come here so often, I probably pay their electric bill. Lol Always an awesome meal with great service. Lots of food for low prices. No complaints here & the Pad Thai & Wonton Soup are always my go to choices :) Definitely recommend to anyone who wants to find a new \"Hole-in-the-Wall\" kind of places!"}
{"text":"WOW!!
Went to dinner and a friend picked this place. I have never eaten here and was secretly excited so I could YELP it.
I do not have much experience with Thai food, but am willing to try anything at least once.

We ordered an appetizer of cream cheese rangoon then Yum Yai Salad and  i had Shrimp Pineapple Curry , He had a chicken curry.  Two Totally different curry dishes but both were spectacular. 

The food was delicious, the facility was clean and service? well that was awesome, My glass was always full, they brought a clean plate after our appetizer and salad. But the best thing? Great food at an unbelievably good price.  

Truly good food.  This is definitely going to become one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"Meh. 
Great service, blah food, but it was cheap. That's the only thing this place has going for it. The bathroom was clean, so there's that."}
{"text":"The food was rather awful.  Ordered sweet and sour chicken that was supposed to be fried.  I guess it was,  but it was mixed in with a very minimal amount of sweet and sour sauce and the veggies.  No sweet and sour on the side.  Whole thing was soggy and the chicken was just a mushy mess.  It was actually pretty gross!  Also ordered the mongolian beef which was pretty good!  The the crispy duck had a weird flavor and the veggies with it were awful.  I don't know why.  Just a strange flavor to them.  The fried rice had a weird sweetness.  Fried rice should never taste like CAKE!  So I ordered 30 dollars worth of food and about 8 dollars worth of it was ok.  I won't order from them again.  I'm usually pretty lenient with chinese food as every place is different, but I just can't recommend this place!  I kept seeing comments about the service, but it was just same old service to me.  Nothing special.  When I called about the sweet and sour sauce missing from the sweet and sour chicken.... was told I had to ask for that extra....."}
{"text":"I have no idea what the food was like here, we were waiting for our food & a roach crawled out from behind the condiments on our table! when we brought it to the servers attention & let her know that we were no longer interested in eating there she didn't even apologize & asked us to post for our drinks...blew my mind! never again!"}
{"text":"The food is really good! And the price better the personal very friendly...best thai restaurant"}
{"text":"Lunch specials & staff have always been consistently good, but we ordered dinner for pick-up and it was awful, just AWFUL.  Two noodle dishes were overcooked to a stuck together glob. Just over-spiced with hot sauce and had almost NO veg mixed in.  Spring roll was tasteless & poorly assembled too.  It was so bad we have decided to even stop going at lunch as we will not support a restaurant that would put out as sub par as we they gave us tonight."}
{"text":"I travel to Vegas eight times a year 
this is the first time I have ever eaten at the same restaurants consecutively 
the food is phenomenal and the prices are great always busy and tasty had Tom Yum soup  shrimp pad thai , massaman 
 all great you must go"}
{"text":"The food is always delicious, and the service is always amazing, everyone is always so nice and greeting! This is my favorite thai food place, too bad it's so far from home! 
Some of my favorite things are the salt and pepper squid, the cream cheese rangoons and the panang curry."}
{"text":"It's not like Thai at all, it was our big wrong pick, the dishes look like they are Thai for eyes but taste is nowhere close to other Thai places in town like Archi/PingPong/PinKaow, it was bland no where close to other regular Thai places...service was good, service could get 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great food at affordable prices. And they have Boba!
Delivery is fast and easy and friendly. The yellow curry and Thai wraps are my favorite (so far)."}
{"text":"I love the Pad Thai Noodles with Chicken and Shrimp!  

I like to drop by Bangkok 9 every time I'm in town (sometimes two or three times per visit!)  I always phone in my Pad Thai order so it is ready when I arrive.  I've never been disappointed.  The noodles and onions are full of flavor and the meat is always fresh.  

I'll always be a return customer!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today, wow great, for $5.95 you get an unbelievable meal. I had chicken/shrimp Pad Thai, comes with soup or salad. The moisture content of the Pad Thai was just right, not too dry or wet. Extremely fast and friendly service. The quality is great, the favor good and the size just right for lunch. The prices are extremely reasonable as well for other dishes. I think I found my go to Thai restaurant. Incredible to go or delivery menu as well."}
{"text":"The staff are so friendly and sweet. For a quick Thai food experience and a very inexpensive restaurant, this is the place. I ordered pad thai and shrimp with walnuts. Both were okay in flavor. But the shrimp had too much batter. Nevertheless, we had a wonderful meal."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery from here because of the good reviews. It wasn't gross, but it wasn't good either. I don't understand how all the flavor can be sucked out of thai food. I have definitely had better."}
{"text":"I've been here several times as I live nearby. And every time it has been awful. The service is fine but the food is just bland and terrible. The pad thai is fake, using noodles that no self respecting Thai would use. The curry tastes like it's from a ready-made packet. The panang curry was disappointing, chewy and just tastes old. I don't expect a lot from joints like this, but this place should be embarrassed to serve Asian food."}
{"text":"Looking online for Thai food delivery we stumbled across Bangkok 9 because they had mango sticky rice as an option.
The food arrived very quickly & we were delighted by how delicious everything was!
We got Tom Kah soup which had great flavor & was super packed with mushrooms!
The pad Thai was nothing special, but the shrimp and white meat chicken were all perfectly cooked. We also ordered a chicken masaman curry that was very tasty, I personally like a slightly thicker curry but it was still good.
The mango sticky rice is a great deal at the $3-4 & was extremely satisfying!
We will definitely be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"We haven't been here for many months. The minute we walked in the waitress brought us our drinks. Remembered our exact order even what appetizer we ordered. Kudos for gem rest food and great service. Never once did we have an empty glass."}
{"text":"I have been going here for 11 years. The server always remembers what my whole family orders. I've never had a bad meal here. The restaurant is always clean, food & service are excellent."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Could be way better but they don't seem to care about quality food or making sure they have the customer's order correct before they send it in to the kitchen."}
{"text":"Among my favorite places to eat. Fair price, great food, outstanding service, \"hot\" means hot. The staff is always friendly, my glass NEVER hits half empty and I drink ALOT of water. They also almost always give my kids free desert. They are awesome."}
{"text":"Had a great experience - just what one expects at a small Thai restaurant - food was great, service was fast, and price was afordable"}
{"text":"So love the curry and tom yum soup here! Always get fast great service and friendly  smiles! Thanks"}
{"text":"Its been awhile waitress still remembers what i always want.
Pad thai n chicken satay..thai tea..."}
{"text":"So we were in the shopping center and he decided that since I like Thai food, we would go here. I was hoping they had improved since my last visit. Service was good, food is not with returning for. The pad Thai was so sticky clumps of it dangled from the fork for over a minute- kind of like that dried out spaghetti on a buffet, looked like & even tasted like rubber bands. Maybe 5 pieces of green onion in the whole dish (less than a full green onion) which made it extremely bland. 
Even the wide rice noodles in the spicy Thai noodle were rubbery. I know it is not just me when he says \"the food is s**t here\". I do believe this is the worst Thai restaurant we've ever been to. Maybe since the employees are Chinese. Guaranteed not to give them another try for 3 strikes."}
{"text":"Four stars is for the food and the 5th star is for the service. We no longer live in that area so we do not go their as often, but 8 months can pass and the owner remembers what we like to order. She remembers the specific way my wife likes her rice and if we go by ourselves she always asks about our son. Try emptying your beverage before she can refill it. It rarely happens."}
{"text":"I ended up at Bangkok 9 after the wait was too long at another place nearby. I can honestly thank that other place for having too long of a wait because Bangkok 9 is top notch. We got the crispy duck, orange chicken, walnut shrimp and crabmeat fried rice. For dessert, the sticky rice with coconut ice cream. I ended up leaving with leftovers which is unheard of for me(embarrassing, I know) but the portion sizes are amazing."}
{"text":"So gross! They don't even deserve a single star. Order $40 worth of food and the sea food chomein made me sick to my stomach. Waste of money!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! It's our go-to for Thai (even though there are other Thai places closer to us). The people that work there are awesome and we just love the food. Pad Thai, pad see ew, pad kra prow, the curries are all delicious and they have the best egg rolls we've ever had :)"}
{"text":"Chicken (and shrimp, apparently) Pad Thai was very bland and dry. Service was fast. Got the order to-go."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been going here for years! Delivery and in restaurant services are great! Must go if you're around Sunset - Stephanie area!"}
{"text":"My Brothers favorite place and it delivered. In town with the family and I will be back!"}
{"text":"we all know that people leave reviews only when their happy and it's like squeezing water from a rock trying to get happy satisfied customers to leave a good review. 
The food here is amazing! it has always been on point I am officially addicted to this place.
First time, I went for eat-in, the service is impeccable! Also, the establishment is exceptionally clean. If i could give more stars I would. Love Love Love (:"}
{"text":"Food is delicious! I think I ordered the Popeye.. Vegetables topped with Peanut sauce, Tofu plus chicken.. It was mouth watering."}
{"text":"This is the best Asian place to go to for amazing service. We never had to ask for refills on our drinks as they were on point. The quality of the food was awesome. You also have the choice of Thai or Chinese, Fusion. I highly recommend this place for great food and service!"}
{"text":"what can I say? after sex tourism this is the worse thing to come from Thailand."}
{"text":"This review was for our food pick-up this week. 3 stars because they gave good service. The food - not good.

We ordered the beef w/ mixed vegetables, the shrimp won ton soup, and panang curry. The lady who took my phone order was very nice and helpful, assisted me in deciding which curry to get, even offered to put in potatoes in the panang when I was on the fence of ordering my usual yellow curry. 

My order was ready when I got there in 10 minutes. Everyone was friendly and thanked me when I left.

So the food... the shrimp won ton soup was for my boyfriend. Good thing I ordered a small because he barely ate it. The mixed vegetables looked dark, not crisp, and just not fresh at all, drowned in a sauce that smelled funny. The panang curry was decent, but not the level 6 spicy I requested.

They seem to have good prices, definitely would've liked taking advantage of their lunch specials, but I'm not sure I can give the food another chance. The good service saved this from being 2 or 1 star review."}
{"text":"Yellow Curry at its finest.. Paired with White Rice, Spring Rolls, and Green Tea Ice Cream. Was a perfect meal for two or three, and all delicious at a perfect price, under $25 with a good tip.

Would recommend absolutely, and I will be ordering from here again!"}
{"text":"Alright, this place is horrid. I went a couple of times already. The first time, i thought the food was decent. Then it went down hill from there. My wife and her friend went there to catch up on stuff and i had them order me a Pad Thai. There was egg shells in the meal.....Not a good thing. Then today, i ordered 2 Pad Thais to go. Sure the portions were big but they cooked under 5 minutes. That also is not a good sign. I took a bite and there was not a hint of flavor. It was like i was eating spaghetti noodles without sauce. VERY DISAPPOINTED!"}
{"text":"First off, I came here specifically because of the pictures provided by Trina T. of the Bangkok 9 stripped crispy chicken.  It looked positively delicious.  I fantasized about it for several days afterwards in order to build up the appropriate appetite for it.  When I arrived at the restaurant and glanced at the menu, it was nowhere to be found.  I was terror-stricken.  I asked them if it was still available and they assured me, yes, they now changed the name of it to orange chicken.  I thought to myself: oh great, not another orange chicken.  I didn't see anything else I thought I'd like on the menu, so I decided to order it anyway (orange chicken is the white man's safe choice, after all)...and I'm so glad I did.  Wow, I was not expecting that.  The chicken was perfect -- crispy and crunchy on the outside, soft and tender on the inside (I could cut it with a fork).  The sauce was delicious; not too overpowering, not too syrupy or sticky and with a decidedly unique flavoring.  The portions were huge (I have dinner packed for tonight) and the price was just right for the level and quality of food being served.  Holy crap, I can't recommend it any better than that.  Hands down the best \"orange\" chicken I've had since moving to Henderson.  In addition, the waitresses were friendly (and cute) and constantly checking up on me, refilling my drink and not making me feel bad about dining alone like a pathetic loser.  An easy 5 stars from me, and I'm pretty stingy with my stars."}
{"text":"For a quick Thai fix this is a good place to go. The pad Thai is actually pretty good, and I love the golden baskets for an appetizer!!! We have been here a few times  for lunch during out break, and it's always easy to get in and out! The entire staff is very friendly and everything we have tried has been pretty good, can't wait to try more of the menu.
The place does look a little run down and dirty, and that's why I had to lower the score to only 3 stars!"}
{"text":"Every time I eat here, my dish is better than the last. Thai tea and Panang Duck is all I need in my life."}
{"text":"I love curry, so every Thai place I go to that is what I get.  I got the green curry with chicken this time, it was okay.  The depth of flavors was not there, everything seemed a little bland, there was some heat, I requested a 4 out of 10, but that was the only real taste I could experience. The rice had some brown spots that I could only assume was burnt spots. 

The service was very fast and the people were very nice. I'll go back but I think I'll have to try something else."}
{"text":"The service was fast, the food was moderately priced and the flavors were good. There was nothing spectacular about it but nothing bad either. They do have a lot of choices to choose from so I'll have to go back and try more dishes."}
{"text":"Happened to stop by here today and I can't give a good review based on food. I ordered the Panang chicken curry, spicy fried rice, and ka prow chicken also some potstickers and golden bags for appetizers. Nothing was delicious and worthy of seconds bites. The curry was plain coconut milk, and the ka prow tasted very fishy and no sign of basil or any ingredients listed in the menu. Anyhow, I will give two stars for good customer service and offering us a chance to choose something else. However the food is not worth it :/"}
{"text":"The pad thai noodle taste good but it needs more sauce it was a little bit dry. I expected it to be tasty."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  

I always order delivery, which comes much quicker than the estimated times, and the delivery man is always so sweet. 

This place has Boba tea which I was super excited to see on the menu. They also have the coconut sticky rice with mango for dessert which is one of my favorites. For delivery they put their coconut sauce on the side though, maybe to not make the rice mushy before you get it, but it's still delicious. 

Their chicken potstickers are DELICIOUS. I really love that they use chicken and not pork because they're significantly less greasy and not so heavy, but the flavor is still amazing. 
Eggrolls are crisp and flavorful as well (I'm a sucker for a good eggroll) and thankfully they provide you with real sweet and sour sauce for dipping as opposed to variations that taste more like duck sauce. 

Now my girlfriend is a picky eater, not someone to try something new, but I talked her into trying a variation of one of her favorite foods: fried rice. She ordered the curried fried rice. Taste wise, she thought it was okay (it was new so an \"okay\" was quite the response) but it was difficult to eat. She ordered it as medium on the spice level and it was very spicy. And I mean, we put hot sauce and spices on everything so we were both surprised to have something so spicy we could only eat small amounts at a time.

On that note, I decided to try something I'd never tried and ordered the red curry. I, too, ordered my spice level at a medium and had a hard time eating too much at a time. But the flavor was great. After that I ordered it mild and it was still spicy, and still delicious. If you eat it over rice, it is a little thin. At first I thought it was more of a soup. If you eat it more as a soup it's amazing. 

I love this place and will continue to order in the future."}
{"text":"I wanted Chinese and the girlfriend wanted Thai, so this place was a match made in heaven. I had the orange chicken and it was delicious, huge portion as well. My girlfriend had the TomYum soup and it was great as well. The restaurant was very clean and the service was fantastic, never had an empty glass of water the entire meal. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Boy how things have changed.  The staff and menu are the same, but the way the food is prepared is completely different (not in a good way) and the service has become very slow.

I'm not sure what happened, by I hope they get their act together."}
{"text":"This place has really good vegan Thai food, I highly recommend #42 Garlic eggplant!
Nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Had the best dinner here last night. I can't believe there are bad reviews on this place. Service was wonderful prices were great and food was excellent. We had salt and pepper squid for an appetizer and their spicy noodle and Pagang curry duck. The food was spicy and flavorful. The iced tea was delicious and all that came to $33. I want to drive out of my way to eat at this place more often."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today. The service was great but I was totally disappointed by the food. From the egg rolls and curry to the fortune cookie nothing taste right to me. I ended up throwing most of the food away because I couldn't deal with the flavor, it was nothing like the Thai food I have eaten before. I didn't see the food advertised as \"fusion\" so I expected the Thai curry at least to taste similar to other Thai curries I've had before. I don't see myself ordering from here again unfortunately."}
{"text":"Great curry, beef salad and noodle dishes.  Not as spicy as first time I came here but they have ground flakes on the table along with soy and fish sauce.  Always enjoy eating here when I'm on this end of town."}
{"text":"Nice place! We have been here for the weekday lunch special and for lunch on the weekend and both times the food was terrific. Husband had Spicy Chicken Wings and said they are better than any wings he's had anywhere. He loves super hot wings and these were great! Pad Thai and other noodle dishes I've had are wonderful. This restaurant is clean, The people are friendly and professional."}
{"text":"This little gem is consistently great! The service is phenominal. The curry dishes (all of them) are exemplary. It reminds me of the best little restaurant in Chang Mai."}
{"text":"This is only a review for the Thai dishes, which were all mediocre at best. Pad See Ew had very little flavor, same with the Tom Kha Kai soup. Red curry was watery and flavorless. But at least the service was friendly."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we live right down the street. 

Its a small venue but they were able to seat us quickly. We went around dinner and there wasn't too many people in there. 

we ordered the won ton soup hot pot. Which was really delicious, vegetables were fresh but the won tons were kind of small. But the vegetables made up for it. We also ordered the honey walnut shrimp, pineapple fried rice, and the eggplant delight. All of which were all good!! The pineapple fried rice is like a regular friend rice except they added pineapples which is the only thing different. The honey walnut shrimp had a really good tempura batter on the shrimp and it was crunchy as well. Yuuum! the eggplant delight was eggplant with chicken and shrimp and that was really good as well if your a eggplant lover. Which me and babe are!!

Before we headed home we made sure to get a thai tea with boba to go. It wasn't all that. LOL the tea wasn't sweet and it was warm, even though my ice was already melted. But everything else was good."}
{"text":"Delivery was quick. My yellow curry was OKAY, this curry wasn't spicy at all, I usually like mine medium spice level. The pot stickers were delicious and the gold bags appetizer were decent. don't know if I'll be coming back"}
{"text":"This is good for fast, mild flavored Thai food. Like if your food companion is a food sissy then take them here. Nothing is too spicy or strong tasting. The staff has always been so good to me. I feel in debt to them and keep returning for all the kindness they have given me. The parking has non-parallel rows and cars come from all directions so be safe."}
{"text":"So we're not talking about fine dining here, we are speaking of your traditional Thai/Chinese food establishment complete with Buddha statue and Asian fans mounted to the walls. 

Service was timely and professional, food was not scary at all and in fact very tasty. Egg rolls were pretty good if you forgo the fact all of the filling falls out on the first bite. The soup was spicy and fantastic and definitely hit the spot. Fried rice was pretty traditional and what you'd expect from an establishment such as this. And the Pad Thai was flavorful yet interesting.. My only disappointment was the fact that the Pad Thai noodles looked more like spaghetti than your traditional \"fettuccine\" shaped noodle. 

Delicious on day one but the left overs pretty much summed up why I don't usually care for left overs. The tastiness disappeared once the food was refrigerated and reheated.. Oh well! 

Just go to Bangkok 9 eat, drink, and be merry and forget the wasting a tree (to-go box) to bring your leftovers in. Only good the first time around. 

Would I follow up Bangkok 9 with a repeat visit, absolutely! Traditional, and tasty, those are my words to sum up this experience."}
{"text":"Super great service.  The online order was easy and fast. The food was ready  for pick up on time and service  is friendly"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place when I'm craving Thai food. They give you really generous portions for the reasonable prices, especially with the pad thai. The pad Thai usually lasts me 2 days, and for only under $8! Every time I've ordered from them, they've been fast, efficient, and very friendly. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"First off, we LOVE a good curry, and Bangkok 9 delivers!  You can get a great lunch special that comes with a salad with peanut dressing or a salad.

First off, peanut salad dressing......this dressing would make George Washington Carver cry with sweet tears of joy.  I didn't think something that was akin to peanut butter mixed with some spices and what I was guessing was some vinaigrette would be so delicious on a salad.  Well punch me in the gut and tell me I was wrong....cause I'm wrong.

Second, the owners and operators are super friendly.  While we were eating we could hear them talking to customers, who were were assuming are regulars, as the owner/operators were asking where they were yesterday.

Lastly, the coconut ice cream does NOT disappoint.  I whole heartily believe that if mana where to fall from heave in the form of coconut ice cream this would be it.  It was creamy, cool, and oh so coco nutty..........sorry I blacked out remembering this delicious cool treat.  

I've been multiple times and it never  disappoints."}
{"text":"When my gf lets me I frequent this place as often as possible. The people are so friendly and I would consider myself as a frequent customer to this establishment. Try the pad thai with chilli sauce and a bo bo drink. YUM"}
{"text":"I have been going here since 2001 and they have never let down. It's always good food and good service. Don't let the small dining area fool you because they get a lot  of to go orders."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed! Ordered the yellow curry and Thai BBQ chicken. Curry was like soup with no flavor and 95% onions. The BBQ chicken was so dried out from being deep fried it was crispy but not in a good way."}
{"text":"My fav Thai.  Period.  

The soup is my favorite part of the meal:
Tom Yum Shrimp - Hot Pot @ $8.95 (serves 2 or more).  They have a smaller version for $4.95.  
Comes in a great pot that stays warm by the lighted flame.  They also ask you your preferred spicy level from 1-10.  We like 8 or 9 and cannot get enough of this soup!

Have tried several other dishes including the Spicy Rice, Crab Rangoon, etc. and love them all.

The service is absolutely perfect!  Your water glass or any beverage for that matter is always kept full.  The entire staff always has a smile on their faces.  It seems that they are happy you are there ... and trust me, I am happy to be there - enjoying their wonderful food and great service.  

Do yourself a favor and visit this local business.  (and yes, they serve alcohol too if and when so inclined)"}
{"text":"The service here is incredible as are the prices! My dish was prepared incorrectly and the server noticed before I did. The dish was swept away and a new one prepared. 

The salad wraps were succulent and yummy. 

The Salt and Pepper shrimp were fantastic. Neither spice was over powering. The salad with it was cool and crisp. The star were the shrimp. The batter is there for the first couple of chews then is slowly melts away in a savory trail of flavor. 

Give this place a try it is heaven."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident after a visit to the Galleria mall. 
   Started with Tom yum soup which was very good. We then ordered 2 dishes.
Mixed veggies with squid and sautéed tofu
and veggies with garlic sauce. Both dishes
were delicious. The service was also very good.
   Babcock 9 is a great find and we will definitely be returning for another great meal."}
{"text":"My whole family has raved about this place for years and I finally had a chance to try it out on our last visit! The service is phenomenal, everyone was so friendly and helpful. We had the beef pad see ew & the chicken pad see ew. I favored the chicken over the beef but they were both fantastic. The prices are ridiculously affordable and they have a great lunch special. We even snuck in for a quick bite before we left town for a second visit because it was so good. We will definitely be back. Random plus, they have delicious tasting water!"}
{"text":"Lunch with my mom
Not Thai spicy
OK

So, last Saturday, I had lunch with my mom at Bangkok 9 while waiting for the dealer to finish up repairs on her car. We were actually heading to L&L but when I saw Thai, she didn't argue with me when I suggested it. 

Nice, clean place. Open dining room - friendly staff. It wasn't very busy but it was a little on the warm side and if I lived in the Las Vegas Valley, I'd be out on the lake cooling off.

Anyway, I opted for the Pad See Oew and I asked for Thai spicy. She didn't understand my request and asked me for a spice level from 1-10. I told her a 9 or 10. When my dish arrived, I was excited because it was steaming hot and it looked to be spicy as I could see the pepper flakes on the noodles and even on the vegetables. 

But it wasn't. That was a big disappointment for me because I wanted and I asked for really hot. Either they didn't feel like I could handle it or they just don't make it Thai spicy. Otherwise, the food as far as taste goes - was ok. It wasn't bad and I actually finished off the entire dish. But it wasn't so good that I'll make a trip out to Henderson to order that same dish again. 

Decent prices overall. Decent service as well. My mom really appreciated how they packaged up her to go container with the left over Mongolian Beef and white rice she didn't finish. They actually separated the two selections using foil in the same container. Attention to details like that got them the third star for me."}
{"text":"Best thai food I've had so far in Las Vegas. Very nice little spot,  clean. Food comes quickly,  very generous serving and always tastes delicious!  I'm currently trying my way through their curry menu - yumm!!!!"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend from work and his family.  He's got three kids, and I was pretty amazed that he got them to eat Thai!  Well, the food here is modeled after Thai, but its not as authentic as Thai Grill and Thai Style Noodle House (among others).  However, to be fair, Bangkok 9 advertises itself as a Thai-Chinese fusion restaurant, so I will be judging it based on that advertisement.  

I tasted the Tom Kha Kai, fried rice with shrimp, the Pad Thai, and the Pad See Eew.  I'd have to say that although it isn't the most authentic Thai food, it was made with fresh ingredients.  The Tom Kha Kai was very sweet, and not spicy at all, which I think was done on purpose for the kids.  The Pad Thai had a bit of red food coloring in the noodles, and I wasn't too into the taste of that dish.  The Pad See Eew with pork was my favorite dish.  It was served with American broccoli, but the taste of the sauce had a light sweetness, and with some added Thai peppers it was pretty good.  

The service was absolutely superb.  They poured our Tom Kha Kai for us, and offered to bag our left overs for us.  They were very tentative, always keeping our drinks nice and full.  We even got two complimentary servings of fried banana and ice cream on the house!

This is a good place for folks who want something different, but aren't exactly Thai food snobs.  Its also really good for kids.  I was impressed with how they handled our large party."}
{"text":"The curry could have used a bit more flavor it was really thick more than my liking ...or was also 40 minutes before closing but the guy behind the counter said no seating only to go :/"}
{"text":"Really nice staff, the service was great. But I don't know why this place gets such good review for the food. I wanted to like it, but it feel short. Everything I ordered ( 3 dishes ) had no real good flavor. Kinda a let down on this place. I probably won't be back. But I do want to note again, that the staff were awesome."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. But the stand out dish were the vegetable egg rolls. Some of the best over ever had."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food, huge portions at an incredible price. Will definitely remember this spot next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Love this place for their authenticity and family-like service. Have been there 3 times and never disappointed. Seems like a lot of \"take out\" customers so there is usually quick seating. The staff is attentive but not pushy. Have enjoyed the fried tofu, the eggplant delight, and the crispy chicken with mango. Did not enjoy the crispy duck not the salt & pepper pork chop, but will definitely keep trying new items."}
{"text":"I'm giving them a three star only because the  food is pretty good and the customer service is great.  However, I will not be returning ever again to eat here after visiting the bathroom and getting a glance of the area behind the front counter and kitchen.  I was horrified at how dirty and disgusting the walls, floors, light switches and sinks were.  Honestly, there is no way this place has ever had a health inspection- or would pass one.  It just makes me wonder about the food prep area....bleh."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the service. Very friendly and the food was delicious. Pad Thai was yummy, but must try the salt pepper wings they were the best thing."}
{"text":"Had I been yelping a few years ago I would've been a duchess of this place.. but seriously, I've never had such amazing Thai food till I came across this restaurant. I usually always get the same thing. Honey walnut shrimp and Pad thai with chicken and shrimp. For those of you who are unfamiliar with pad thai its definitely a staple of Thai restaurants which offers a thrilling mix of stir-fried noodles, peanuts (optional), egg, tamarind sauce and your choice of meat. The honey walnut shrimp is made to perfection (you can really taste the authenticity of the dish). Service is absolutely wonderful. Since I go there often, they already know exactly what I come for. I definitely recommend this to everybody and anybody, you'll all be in for a delicious treat!"}
{"text":"Amazing service, huge portions, great prices!! Best Thai tea so far!  We got the Coconut Shrimp soup, Shrimp Pineapple Curry & Chicken and Shrimp Pad Tai.    Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"Good thai tea!

Horrible food. Pad thai look like it was food colored and the noodle stick together. Salted fried chicken was too dry. 

Would not recommend."}
{"text":"If you enjoy Thai food like myself then this a must in Henderson area.."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a while since I love Thai food and always go to the nail salon next door. I finally had a chance to go during my lunch hour. There was only one waiter and a manager at the cash register. Already, I thought how are they going to manage during the lunch rush. The waiter got our drinks and gave us menus and then it was the manager who took our order. I was really excited to try the food especially at their good price. 40 minutes later everyone else had been served, but our food still had not arrived. I saw him look over at me from over the counter and notice that we were not served yet so he called out to the cook. The cook never got our order!! The manager played it off thinking I didn't know what was going on and asked if we wanted soup. I immediately got up, grabbed my bag, and told my husband to leave. The manager, with a big smile on his face called out \"BYE!\". He thought it was funny. I was fuming. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL. BAD SERVICE."}
{"text":"Wait staff very attentive. Friend and I decided to share lunch and chose appetizers from the menu. The dumplings and the spring rolls were tasty and the sauce that came with it was outstanding! Prices are reasonable and the location convenient for us, since we just finished our Ross shopping and was on our way to Costco for more shopping."}
{"text":"I just ordered the lettuce wraps, chicken satay and pad thai for delivery.  The pad thai was ok to good.  The chicken satay was dry and non-flavorable.  The lettuce wraps -well, a bit shocking and disappointing.  I opened the container of the wraps.  One small container had chopped onions, peanuts and something else.  The other had dry stuff, guessing coconut, nuts and other dry stuff.  I couldn't tell.  The other space had 6 leaves of romaine lettuce.  I was expecting 6 wraps, not flat leaves of lettuce and stuff.  The peanut sauce was very good.  This restaurant gets 3 stars because they were very expeditious in their delivery, despite ordering online through Yelp."}
{"text":"I love this resturant!! Family owned \"I believe\" Same people, with freindly smiles and a warm welcome. Your order is always hot and fresh. Portions are great! Lunch is a great deal but dinner? Of course more food \"I'm a leftover person\". It is very clean and quaint. You never wonder \"Where is my server\" but not on top of you. I've been coming here for many, many years and many more to come! Thank you guy's for the AMAZING food and service!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area from California and was in search of a place to fulfill my Thai food craving. I decided to try out Bangkok 9 since it was pretty nearby. I ordered Pad Thai, Pad See Ew and the shrimp spring rolls. All of which are pretty standard dishes to try I thought. The shrimp spring rolls were alright so I enjoyed those (reason why I'm giving two stars). However, I was disappointed in the noodle dishes. Both were edible but it was mediocre enough that I probably won't be ordering from here again. Neither dish tasted as they should and I've had many from great Thai places in the Bay. Overall, I'd pass on this place :/"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of those strip mall hole-in-the-wall types.  It's tucked away, unseeming, and with little character on the outside.   Frank chose this place on yelp and, to my dismay, we sat in the car justifying our choice for eating here.

We hesitated a bit while walking toward the door, unsure of what lay ahead, but we sucked it up and entered the front door holding our breath and expected the worst (dirty floors, bad service, poor food).  Thankfully, we were wrong.  This cute restaurant has the old school bamboo chairs and tables with menus ready to go.  There are a few servers ready to take your order and watching each table for refills or other needs.  We were seated promptly, received our drink order within a minute and took a good look at the menu.

Their lunch menu is simple--choose a meat, choose a sauce and it's 5.95. We wanted the regular menu, though, so we glanced at it and discovered some interesting dishes we never heard of; two, in fact: Bangkok 9 stripped crispy chicken and the beef.  They both had the same finish--a sweet chili sauce with garlic.  I decided to jump in and try something that sounded different to me, and we ordered off the regular menu at 8 dollars a pop.

The food didn't take long at all, and we were occupied with their lovely steamed (by request) vegetable dumplings that had the thai flavors mixed in.  The sweet soy dip was great, too, and judging by the appetizer we assumed that the lunch itself would be great.  We were right.  First off, the food was beautiful.  The chicken dish was shiny and glazed over with this transluscent, orange chili sauce.  It smelled fantastic.  Although flour coated fried stripped beef doesn't look as appealing, it didn't taste anything like the visual expectation of it.

Their sauce on these dishes are great; sweet, slightly spicy (you can order no heat) and had a garlic (subtle) finish.  The chicken and beef remain nice and crispy despite the sauce, which is something I always look for in fried dishes like that.  It was like eating crispy light pieces of chicken heaven drenched in sweet love.  The plates were piled high, too, so sure enough we had leftovers for lunch the next day.

They provide a bowl of rice enough for 3 - 4 helpings between 2 people, and because the sauce is slightly tangy and sweet (it's really like a thai version of a sweet & sour, but better) the rice is nice to cut that while eating.  By the time we finished the rice bowl was cleaned out and the leftovers neatly packed with more rice (they did it on their own, which was nice).  We patted our tummies and paid a 20 dollar bill (not including tip) that includes 2 dishes, an appetizer and drinks!  Their lunch menu, although cheaper, was good, but I'm so glad we tried their Bangkok 9 dishes instead.

If you're looking for cheap eats in a place where two worlds collide on a plate, try this hidden restaurant in Henderson near Hobby Lobby.  It's good, it's filling, and it doesn't put a hole in your wallet.  You know how I know it was good?  I dreamt about it and craved it the next day.  As a matter of fact I'm going to end this now so I can drive down there for dinner.  Ciao!

PS: If any Guam people read this review, remember House of Chin Fee?  The chicken dish I refer to tastes like their sweet & sour chicken.  I grew up on it, so I'm a fan :)"}
{"text":"I always come here for lunch breaks from school during the weekdays or on weekends with my boyfriend. This place has really great food and amazing customer service. They are extremely friendly and they check back with you in a timely fashion and make sure that you are okay on food and drinks while you dine there.

I always get the pad see ew versus the pad Thai. But their pad Thai I have had as well. I just prefer pad see ew because of the flat noodles. They're orange chicken is like none other of this world! They're orange chicken is on a whole-nother level. It's super crispy. Fresh. And the sauce they use is amazing!

Other options I would recommend is the hot #1 and hot #2 if you love spicy food like me :)"}
{"text":"Chicken Fried rice was good. Atmosphere mew. The beef flat rice with gravy had no flavor."}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of different pad thai places and this one was not bad. The atmosphere of the restaurant was very cozy and casual, I loved the decor and the people working there made sure my cup of green tea was always full. The customer service was great I would stop by again if I was in the area and needed a pad thai fix."}
{"text":"Best in Vegas hands down!! The service here is impeccable. Visit this location once a week."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. They gave me fried bread covered in orange sauce and called it \"Orange Chicken\". What little chicken there was was like dried out jerky. I kid you not. Worst experience ever. Buyer beware."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like the food here because the service is great.  The staff members were very friendly and my order was finished quickly.  The service was so good that I can't in good conscience  give them a one star review.  5 stars for service, 1 star for the food... \"Meh.  I've experienced better.\" is the best way to describe my opinion about the restaurant overall.

I ordered a curry dish.  The rice and veggies were cooked well, but it was hard to enjoy it because the curry was sooooooo greasy.  You could actually see the separation in the container, but mixing it didn't help the overpowering greasiness.  I've never experienced anything like it.  I honestly don't understand the positive remarks about the food.  Perhaps I will try again, but I'm not in a hurry to do so anytime soon."}
{"text":"This is our go to place, for good Thai food. It's never disappointing us. The people who work here, are so nice to us, and they talk to us like we are their family. The food is super good. It's quick to order. We wont go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Excellent Food and Service, pricing is reasonable.  Unlike other oriental restaurants each dish had a different and distinctive flavor,  The Teriyaki sauces is light and Favorable, Salt/Pepper squid is excellent!
The service is superb!  Adequate attention without interference and there when you need them!"}
{"text":"This place is decent. Friendly service. Food came out really fast. I'd ordered Pad See Oew. It has a Chinese-style taste. Fried bananas are good. Good lunch deal. I also came here for dinner. Their beef curry was pretty good, and they gave us desert soup (bean and tapioca) that you would get at a hk restaurant. This place reminds me of my mom's cooking."}
{"text":"I love this place! nice family owned, hole in a wall restaurant. I been eating here since 2005. My favorites are pineapple shrimp curry, fried pork chop, pad Thai, Thai tea and Thai coffee. My go to when I'm feeling lazy because they deliver too."}
{"text":"Very friendly and welcoming staff, along with delicious and flavorful Thai food. I visit at least once a week with my friends and highly recommend the green curry and shrimp pad thai."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for the seafood tom yum soup for 9 years! The food is delicious but the service is the best. The staff is so welcoming and attentive.  We have tried to find a similar place closer to home since this place is about a 20 minute drive from our house but so far nothing has come close to it. We love it here."}
{"text":"I love this thai place! They have great service, super fast delivery, and great prices. Favorite things to order are the pineapple fried rice and walnut shrimp. If you live in the area, they do a great job with home delivery. I ordered and had the food at my house in 15 mintues!"}
{"text":"Really love this place for Thai food! Excellent and friendly customer service and delicious dishes. I highly recommend sitting in and getting the big pot of Tom Yum. I also really enjoyed the Pad Woonsen and their crab rangoons. They also have really good house sweet and sour sauce"}
{"text":"I got the pad thai which I assume can never be messed up at a Thai place but I was wrong. The chicken tasted old and the noodles were stuck together in one big lump. The shrimp was okay I guess but the meal as a whole was not impressive. Sadly after I ate it I read some reviews and there was similar experiences. Bummed cause I live close by and was hoping for a good Thai place but I won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"We order out from here a couple times a month. Everything is amazing. I am a huge fan of their glass noodle salad. And the yellow curry is fab. If you order online make sure you note what level of spiciness you want. The curry is great at about a 6 or 7. They are so quick but it's always fresh."}
{"text":"Here is a updated review since we seem to come here a little more often....

Always really great service from the wait staff and although a small place there is always people dining there. The prices are very reasonable and the food is fresh and tasty. I wouldn't say it was high end gourmet dining, but we never had a bad  experience here. Consistent service, consistent food quality. We both like it and dine here at least once a month for good Thai/Chinese food.
Appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 Thai teas = $30 for dinner AND we always have leftovers to take home for later."}
{"text":"I ordered eggplant with beef and it tasted awful. Husband ordered red curry and it just tasted really bland. Service was horrible, no customer service. Will not come back."}
{"text":"I've been here several times for the their lunch specials because it is close to our school, and it's pretty reasonably priced. For around 6 bucks, you get a good amount of food for a lunch, and a decent amount of variety. It looks like any small thai restaurant does inside-- bamboo and statues help create a pleasant vibe.

I've had the green, red, and panang curries, and I've also tried their glass noodles. It's a great little spot for a casual lunch hour. Much better than the Pad Thai restaurant located near the Valley Hospital Medical Center. The service is decent, and I was satisfied with the seasoning of the food every time I ate here. The portions are just right if you are in need of lunch sized servings. Don't get me wrong-- it doesn't blow you away but it certainly brings you back. I wouldn't waste my time for dinner here because there are better, higher quality establishments out there for such an occasion but if you want to save money, who am I to judge? It sure beats the hell out of crappy fast food Chinese. You'll get in, get your food quickly, scarf it down, and be happy you came here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We have been coming here for about 5 years and the customer service is great and the food is even better. This is our go to Thai food! Love their Penang curry, Honey Walnut Shrimp and a lot more. If your looking for a great Thai Resto, this is it."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Have eaten there several times over the years. This time I ordered takeout. Went great. Very friendly staff. Order ready when scheduled. 

The Red Curry is the best, five stars. I could each it every day. Crab Rangoons are great. Mongolian Beef is very good. Spicy Fried Rice is okay, a little plain and dry. 

The serving size are huge. Each dish can easily serve two. I actually get four meals out of each."}
{"text":"Last night I was craving some Thai food, but since it was almost 9 pm many of the restaurants near me were about to close.

I decided to give this place a shot and I'm so happy I did because it definitely satisfied my craving, not to mention everything was reasonably priced. The average plate was about $8, which totally works for my budget.

Thai tea: absolutely delicious and authentic. At most other places I've been to, the Thai tea is either too sweet or tastes like it's just some powdered stuff. The tea here didn't taste like that at all. 

#32: I forget the kind of curry I ordered, but it started with an M and I ordered it with beef. It had kind of a subtle sweetness to it, which combined with the savoriness of potatoes and onions was a dynamite combination.

Chow mein: this is probably the healthiest chow mein I've ever had, it didn't seem to be cooked with much oil and there were a lot of vegetables. 

The service was incredibly quick and the staff was super attentive. They came by and cleared the dirty dishes right away, and checked in to see if I needed anything. 

I will definitely be coming back in the future!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to eat Thai.  The staff is great and the food is pretty good.  I love their sticky rice.  Be careful the cook makes everything pretty hot, even if you ask them to make it mild (that why only 4 stars) other wise everything we have tried is great."}
{"text":"BEST mixed vegetables and shrimp I've ever had.  Vegetable soup with shrimp is also delicious. The steamed trout was too fishy tasting for what I'm used to. Very customer friendly place. Our favorite for Thai food."}
{"text":"I live on this stuff, Bangkok 9 is tasty, Great food, Nice sized portions, Good prices.

Try it..."}
{"text":"The gentleman running this place was incredibly kind and helpful to a noob like myself. He answered a ton of questions and was always willing to make suggestions. The food was right on point, leaving me sweating from the extra Thai chilli's that I had requested. I would definitely recommend giving this place a try. I am no Thai expert but their curry was delicious and I can't wait to go back.20 bucks for two people btw and that works for my wallet any day."}
{"text":"Probably some of the most uninspired and on original Thai food I have ever had.   The Satay was deep fried.  The Thai barbecue chicken, it is not barbecued. It is cut up into small pieces and deep fried. Exact same taste it has the satay but with no peanut sauce.  Mee Krob Was essentially noodles with sweet-and-sour sauce on it.
Some of the vegetables that we had, they were wilted and notably old.  There are better options out there, I would not waste your time here.    I will upload a photo of the barbecue chicken"}
{"text":"Every single time I've eaten here, their food quality and presentation has been top-notch. Their service is friendly and prompt; their welcoming smile on our frequent visits is an open invitation to come back. If you're looking for a new Thai restaurant that's off the beaten path, this one is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great food,    reasonable prices,    decent portions, attentive service.    I will be going back."}
{"text":"Been here once before and the food continued to satiate my ever hungry palate.  The first time around I went with the pineapple fried rice, usually a safe bet at any Thai joint.  The fried rice was delicious on that go so I made it a point to be a little more adventurous and try something else on the menu and step out of my shell a little bit.  I went for the Rad Na and it was definitely just as, if not more, delicious than the fried rice.  Yeah, I know it's apples and oranges here, but I'm definitely glad I stepped out of my box and tried something I usually wouldn't go for.  The sauce was light, delectable, and good all the way to the end.  The only downside here at the \"9\" is that I didn't see a lunch special menu.. but the tasty grubs made up for it and made me forget about the regular price on my dish.

Good grubs, will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This our go to quick weeknight Thai take out. Nice portions and easy on the family wallet. Great service and the food taste good to."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick dinner before going to see the Christmas lights at Ethel M's. Dinner was fast, hot, and hearty. Fresh ingedients, nicely seasoned, served by a friendly and efficient staff. Large portions and reasonably priced. Win, win, win!"}
{"text":"Walked into an upscale and cozy hole in the wall, with all the cliché trappings of a \"hey look Americans this is where you get Asian food\" restaurant; w/ and odd coupling of credence clear water playing in the background. I enjoyed the ambience and irony.

 Golden purse wanton was a good start. I couldn't tell if they were fresh or from frozen but if you use clean oil at the right temp...I really don't care. The wanton soup seemed fresh. I liked it. The shrimp mango salsa crispy chicken was ok. My over-all meal was AVG or a pinch above not great but not bad. 

The best problem I had was my favorite problem to have. They had really good customer service; almost to the point of harassment. Certain parts of Henderson have slim pickings cuisine wise. This place is fine in a pinch. I wouldn't make a special trip to eat here. I wouldn't avoid it either."}
{"text":"Nice little Mom & Pop place.  Food was good quality.  Prices were reasonable.  Service was good.  I'd recommend this place for lunch.  The food was surprisedly good.  I really can't wait to go back and try another dish.  Deserts were good and they had lunch specials if you don't want to order from menu. I'd definately recommend this place for lunch"}
{"text":"Amazing! Really good food, large portions, great prices.. I love Thai food, and this is the best in Vegas I have tried so far. Must go here.."}
{"text":"The food wasn't very memorable. My mom's peanut chicken and tofu wasn't super temperature hot, and my curry wasn't very spice hot, but both had good enough flavor. I was trying to find some new Thai in the area since I feel Penn's has gone downhill in quality and uphill in price. This place didnt seal the deal for me. 

Lunch specials were decently priced, and service was alright. Probably wouldn't go back on my Thai food quest."}
{"text":"This place has to be one of the most STINGIEST places I've been too by far I ordered a lunch special of CHICKEN chow mein and I only saw one small piece of chicken, when I asked for an extra thing of hot sauce the cashier gave me the dirtiest look not wanting to give it to me .... It upsets me that they have a restaurant full of people dinning in yet they cannot give more as if they're not making money will not return to this disgusting place again"}
{"text":"This is a gem I found during Christmas shopping and I've been loven it ever since! There are two places in town that I know of that have one of my favorite mouth watering meals.....crispy duck curry, it's the big O of food;)! If you've never had it before I highly recommend you try, your mouth only lives once and your taste buds and tummy will thank you. The prices are fair, servings are large and friendly fast service:)"}
{"text":"Love this place!

Delicious:
The Tom Kha soup
Eggplant delight
Pad Thai
Green Curry
Panang Curry
Marman Curry 
Chicken Satay...

Really friendly staff, reasonable prices, and they deliver. They quickly became one of my go-to places when I moved to Henderson :)"}
{"text":"Holy cow there Thai Tea is amazing and the curry is so spicy and awesome."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Thai spot when shopping at Galleria mall.  Server knows our order and is always happy to see us and makes us feel welcome."}
{"text":"I finally felt well enough to crawl out of bed after fighting a nasty cold for days.  I headed over here for the red chicken curry (#8 on the spicy chart) lunch special & some soup.  Friendly price, delicious AND broke up what was left of the congestion!  I'm a new woman!  Thank you Bangkok9!

Almost forget to add - to update someone else's bad review they no longer have booth seating..."}
{"text":"MUST TRY !!! 
This place is a hidden treasure. There food is consistently fresh and portions are perfect.
They are true to the beautiful heritage of Thiland. The spices they use are authentic and delicious.  They deliver quickly and if you prefer to dine in they make you feel right at home. 100% guarantee you will love this spot !"}
{"text":"My wife and I with a couple of friends went to dinner here the other day and found that the food was very good and in large portions!, the price is very reasonable and the service very responsive.  (I am going to go and buy a thesaurus  now after reading how often I used the word very) If you like Thai food go and try this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting a friend at their work when they asked us if we wanted to get in on the Chinese food they were about to have delivered. I said sure (husband wasn't hungry),  and she pulled out the menu for Bangkok 9 for me to look over. 

I decided on the pineapple friend rice which had chicken, shrimp, pineapple, egg and tomato. We also got an order of spring rolls and crab rangoons. I don't recall the actual prices of anything but everything was reasonable. 

Our food arrived fairly quickly. I had a ton of pineapple in my rice. Would have liked a little more shrimp and the tomato was kind of odd but otherwise it was tasty. Even with my husband having a little there was lots left over, huge portions. I liked the rangoons a lot, they had a generous amount of crab and cream cheese stuffing. Spring rolls were fine, not sure I'd order them again though. 

Overall not a bad dinner experience. I wouldn't mind trying other menu items in the future."}
{"text":"Egg rolls were over cooked and hard. My dish was hot when I finally got it. My kids (love Thai food) ate less than 1/4th of their food and said they could not eat it. :("}
{"text":"In a town full of Thai restaurants, I've avoided this place for years due to the relatively lackluster average Yelp rating. I finally gave them a shot after reading good things about it from friends and seeing how cheap their lunch specials are ($5.95) in their insert in the weekly postal ads.

I went for the pad see oew (with beef), which I feel is generally is a safe choice. My choice of egg drop soup (instead of salad with peanut sauce) arrived quickly. It was in the lower range of hot, not scalding. Worse yet, it was bland. There is nothing memorable about it but the lack of flavor.

I still hadn't finished the foreboding soup entirely by the time my entree arrived. It concerned me that it came out so quickly, and I could tell from the first bite that there just wasn't a lot of sauce. Sure, the noodles were hot and not undercooked, and the veggies were decent, but you need to have that sweet and savory flavor to make the pad see oew what it is. The meat was okay but didn't really have any bite to it. It basically felt like a half-hearted attempt from a Chinese cook to do a Thai dish. Why Chinese? Because I recognized the language spoken by the employees and because no self-respecting Thai restaurant ever serves fortune cookies.

I also sampled some of my friend's pad thai. Similar sauce issues, similar passable level of cooking. My egg roll, which I finally tried later on in the meal, was almost a typical uninspired vegetarian egg roll except for how mushy the filling was.

In spite of how cheap the meal was, it was some of the worst Thai food that I've had. I was thinking about coming back to try a curry, but I don't have much faith that they'll execute it properly since they can't pull off the classic noodle dishes. Also, I would rather avoid the egg roll. I will stick to Thai Food To Go for awesome lunch specials or perhaps Penn's Thai House or Thai Chili for a short drive."}
{"text":"I used to live by a different Bangkok 9 in the NW part of the valley that I liked very much for a while before it closed. I was hoping this one would be as good. It doesn't quite live up to my expectations but there are a lot of positives.

This Bangkok 9 is a small restaurant and nice looking onside. It is a relaxing atmosphere. I could smell fresh basil as soon as I walked it. That was pleasent. It is fairly clean though the sign board on my table could have used a wipe down. Service was friendly and my food came out fast. So far so could.

I ordered my old stand by of red curry chicken. For the price, I got a lot of curry. I was actually surprised at how much. It was loaded with chicken, carrots, bamboo and basil. It looked good and smelled better but there was something lacking. It seemed watered down. The sauce was very thin. I couldn't really taste the curry. Some coconut and spice was about it. It was so thin I had a hard time spooning it over my rice. Which, by the way, I felt tricked into paying $1 for. I ordered my curry and was asked if I wanted white rice. I said \"yes\" thinking it was a choice of white or fried rice like so many other restaurants. Besides, I've never had curry that didn't come with rice. I was rather surprised when I got the bill and saw the charge.

I'm kind of disappointed with this Bangkok 9. I was happy to see they still have chicken lettuce wraps on their menu. A dish that the one in the NW removed before they closed. I may go back at least once to try their lettuce wraps but I think there are other options in the area."}
{"text":"Cheaper isn't always better.. I love papaya salad like no other and I was quite disappointed with what I got.. Half box full of iceberg lettuce that did not look fresh.. (Supposed to be a cabbage wedge) Papaya salad was just horrible.. Either they forgot to squeeze some lime into it or they just make it their way but I had to squeeze my own just so it would taste a little bit better and taste like the Thai papaya salads I'm used to eating. The krapow.. I don't even know what to say about that. The only thing out of the three things I had ordered that was at least okay was the tom yum shrimp.. Definitely will not be coming back for \"Thai\" food."}
{"text":"Awesome food! 
However... During my stay with the manager was walking up and down the hallway yelling at someone on the phone back and forth very loud and it was very disruptive while I was enjoying my meal. Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Great food and prices. Quick friendly service. I had red curry and my wife had teriyaki chicken. We loved them."}
{"text":"Pretty average and the prices fit the dishes. If you're wondering the mangoes are ripe and the sticky rice is delicious. No sesame seeds so that was a disappointment. They forgot my Thai coffee and free egg rolls. I called the lady and I got both delivered 15 minutes later. Big enough portions for two days!"}
{"text":"Lunch special VERY good. 5.95 for chicken curry, rice egg roll and soup or salad! Even have a full portion to go left over. Also go hot Jasmine, only 1.50 for the whole pot # good times!:)ps they take credit card (not debit)"}
{"text":"Have eaten here a few times.  I give it a two star because the food isnt consistent. You either get lots of vegis or lots of protein but they'd always short you  on the carbohydrates. The service is good up until they put the check on the table. I sat there hadn't paid and asked for a refill on my water and never received it. I ended up paying and leaving. I was with a party of four other people and the space isn't really big enough to accommodate more than 4 people at each table so my brother in law was the odd man out. He sat with out space at our table for about twenty minutes until someone asked if we needed to add a table for him. They dont speak much English so when you order you have to use  the meal number not just say the name. All in all it was a mediocre dining experience."}
{"text":"Great Small mom & pop Thai place that has been here for years and they always have friendly and helpful staff.
They have a Mon-Fri lunch special, that is worth a try for $5.95.
They have some liquor and they do Bobas.
And if course teas."}
{"text":"First time here and it was great! 
I have tried better before but the food is still really good considering their awesome price. 
Portions are a plus also! The staff is so friendly 

We live nearby so we will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"As far as casual Thai restaurants go this is one of my favorites. I've been here many times and the food is consistently delicious. The service has always been top notch as well.

The service is very attentive. On our most recent visit we were greeted right away and offered several seating options. Drinks arrived very soon after being seated and they were ready to take our orders, but not in a rushing manner. The food came out quickly and our glasses never went empty. At the end of the meal they offered to go boxes and had leftovers boxed up in no time. 

I usually order the Pad Thai. It's usually a boring option, but I really enjoy their Pad Thai. I liked that it has chicken and shrimp as the protein. Recently I ventured out and tried the Yellow Curry and Hot Chili dish. Both were excellent. The curry came with large pieces of potato in the dish as well. The hot chili dish was loaded with vegetables. All of the dishes are large portions. Their heat scale is 1 to 10. We opted for 7 on everything and the only dish that was really hot was the Hot Chili. I'd probably max the scale next visit. I think the pricing is right for the quality and the portions."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and have sampled a few dishes. They definitely give you a good deal for what you pay, and the service has always been friendly. I personally like the orange chicken, duck, and fried pork chops. 

Their lunch deals are pretty sweet too, most dishes are 5.99.

I would pass on the boba."}
{"text":"The people here were very nice, but the food was just not very good. We eat a lot of Thai. I ordered yellow curry and it was watery and did not taste like any thai curry I've ever had. The Pad Thai my wife ordered was also a little off. Maybe their chinese food is better? I might go back and try the Orange chicken, but wouldn't risk the thai food here."}
{"text":"Terrible food appalling customer service order delivery if you want to be harassed by the delivery driver just ridiculous"}
{"text":"I spoke to a young lady over the phone and ordered chicken pad thai and spring rolls for dinner.  The young lady didn't know what spring roll was which was completely awkward.  I explained to her what spring roll is.  After that she told me it will take 10 minutes.  Asked her if she needs my name over the phone, she said no I have your number, which was awkward to say the least.  I arrived there to pick up my order, order was right, orders are delicious.  Managers need to train there employees there much better for service and how to take orders better over the phone.  That is why this place got a 4 out 5 stars"}
{"text":"Tom yum soup, pad see yew, and curry. I always order these plates when I come here and it's so good. The waiters are nice and its really really clean."}
{"text":"I came in here with some coworkers for lunch. The lunch special price is pretty good, but too good to be true (at least quality-wise). The price is cheap because you get what you pay for. I got pad Thai to play it safe, and it was mediocre at best. I ate half and took the rest home because the portions are actually pretty big. But it's something you may not want to eat again later. The bottom of my plate had a pool of oil. A few of my coworkers got the curry, which the waiter told me was very popular and seemed to be trying to steer me into getting that. But when I saw their plates it had oil pools on top of the curry. Pretty gross. 

The decor and ambiance are not any better. The whole place looks like it just needs to be scrubbed down. Everything just looks dingy and oily. Even the menus where disgusting and dirty looking. If you give me a dirty menu, which is one of the main things I'm looking it when ordering, then I question the cleanliness of the kitchen, which I can't see. 

I was forced to come here by a coworker, and I'd been putting it off for a while because I'd heard how gross it was. But this coworker was insistent that I would like the price and the food. But alas, he was very wrong and everyone else was very right. I would not touch this place if I was starving and there was nothing else to eat. First it needs to be cleaned, maybe even gutted then cleaned, and the food doesn't need to be covered in oil, then maybe I'd consider going back. They are there to provide bad quality food that tastes mediocre at cheap prices. If that's what you're looking for then this is your place. But it's definitely not for me."}
{"text":"This place is ok...I was with a friend and we were out shopping and got hungry so we stopped in here.  The service was really good, they seated us quickly, came to take our drink orders and then came back to take the food order.

The food was not bad, everything was prepared the way we desired and staff was very friendly and helpful.

We had 3 different dishes and based on those 3 I would venture to say just about anything you get here will be pretty decent.  I would definitely go back to this place again when in the area as I love Chinese, Thai Food and just cannot seem to get enough of it but all places are not the same.

This place is one of the better one's at least based on this experience, we will see next time, I hope they continue to please."}
{"text":"The service is outstanding! never had a bad
Meal & my favorite is the tempura & the TomYum
Soup!! I have been visiting this restaurant for
Years!!"}
{"text":"This is my personal favorite Thai spot. It may not look pretty, but don't judge a book by its cover. They do some amazing work back in the kitchen. Food is flavorful and perfected each and every time. I am never disappointed. It's inexpensive and there is so much food. Try out the lettuce and chicken wraps. They are delicious!"}
{"text":"First time eating here, my boyfriend and I absolutely loved it! We had the Lunch Special (from Mon- Fri 11am-3pm) and everything was delicious for a very good price. Also the service was very friendly. I had the shrimp with the number 40 (rice noodles with soy souce and veggies) and it comes with a small soup or salad and an egg roll. We will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"I recently had a very disappointing meal delivered from here--1 star since delivery was fast. I ordered egg rolls which were good (additional star), but my pad thai was not even close to tasting even semi-authentic--it was red colored (never seen such red colored pad thai before) and consisted of very dry stuck together noodles with absolutely no flavor. The wonton soup I ordered did have a ton of chicken in it, but the wontons were so soggy they pretty much fell apart the second my spoon touched them and the soup was soooooo bland."}
{"text":"I have to be honest ... I use to really love this place but last couple of times I went ... the chicken tasted recooked and not at all fresh... eh kinda saddens me ... case they have the best dam curry ive ever tried !!!they need to up there grade in beef and chicken ... I use to come here alot ... but ever since then I stoped case no one wants to eat left over recooked tough chicken ... :,( I hope they can learn off this ... before then I gave it a perfect 5 .... only reason im ratein it lower is in hopes they never compromise again ..."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. We came here after reading comments on Yelp and so glad we did. The Tom Yum Soup was really great!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy eating here because their service is always good. They always ask how you are doing and if everything is good with the food. Their food comes out pretty quick and I usually order panang chicken. I also recommend eating their honey walnut shrimp and pad Thai, it's so delicious."}
{"text":"Yellow Curry is good. It doesn't always taste the same but most of the time it's decent.
It's not one of the best Thai places I've been to but I don't think Thai is their specialty.

I just like yellow curry mostly. I ordered a soup, I think a seafood soup here. It was not something I would ever order again but someone else might like it. 

The food isn't bad it just isn't really special. I would call it mediocre or average for Chinese and Thai. That's why Im giving 3 stars. 

One thing I will say is the portion is quite large. I don't think I've ever finished the curry in one sitting but at the price you pay for how average it tastes you should atleast get a large portion. 

The staff are nice. Anytime I've ever interacted with them they've been kind and always offer me a water when I'm waiting to pick up. 

If you just wanna grab something to eat real quick it's not a bad place. Just don't expect it to blow your mind if you are looking to try something new. I just like curry and it's down the street. When I don't feel like driving far for the good Thai places I'll just grab a curry here real quick."}
{"text":"Much better than I expected.  The service when we visited was very attentive.  I wasn't feeling the lunch menu much but they let me order from the dinner menu.  

We had steamed veggie dumplings, deep fried strip beef and deep fried strip chicken.  I loved those dumplings and the sauces on the entrees were excellent.

Good food, good prices and good service.  I definitely have to come back here and check out some of the other selections."}
{"text":"Love this little place! The food is consistently good and the service is always very attentive and friendly.  We've never had a bad experience.  They have a comfortable atmosphere, reasonable prices... all the things we hope for in our quick lunch-stop restaurants.  

We usually order the Crab Rangoons to start, which are very good in comparison with a lot of other places.  I get the Chicken Krung Prow often and enjoy the spicy kick it has, while my husband explores the menu ordering something different every time, and seems to never have anything negative to say about any of his dishes.  Rice is, of course, included, and our drinks have not ever run out before someone is swooping in with a refill.

Honestly, the food could be half as good and we'd still make regular stops based on the service alone.  You are really taken care of here!"}
{"text":"I found a cooked up roach in my food! GROSSE!

too bad cause the ambient is good.. but I go out to eat mainly for the food."}
{"text":"02/15/11 DINNER. ONLY DID DELIVERY, SO SERVICE NOT REVIEWED. 

Hot & sour soup quite good, filled with lots of stuff. Crabmeat fried rice good, not great. Panang duck was good, spicy, but not much flavor in duck. (Guess can't complain for the price, under $10.) Spicy noodle, with chicken, shrimp AND squid, was outstanding. In every dish we asked for spicy, VERY spicy, where appropriate, and we got spicy. Final price tag was HIGHER than advertised on website, even factoring in tax, so either they've raised prices OR they are indeed charging for delivery (even tho website says free with $15 purchase). Overall, some really good thai food, but nothing to go out of the way for."}
{"text":"I decided to stop here because it was sort of close by and I have passed it a million times. 

Im glad I stopped by. 

Again I know Im in the right place with Im surrounded by Asian patrons. I had the lunch special which was 5.99. 

The soup was rich and flavorful for chicken soup. 

I had the cashew nut delight with squid and it was really delicious. 

The thai iced  tea was great. I have never had it before and was pleasantly surprised.

I will be back"}
{"text":"Finally after 6 months of searching (with no luck) for an honest Chinese place that we can frequent, we have  found this place. Its a small, very clean, with amazing service and staff. The food is reallllly good and generous portions at a more than reasonable price. We were starting to think it was too much to ask for a neighborhood Chinese restaurant that we can frequent once a week or so. thrilled to have found Bangkok 9!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The food is always so delicious and comes out quick! Our waitress always remembers our order and is very friendly :) I highly suggest checking this place out if you like Thai food, the menu has so much to pick from! (I suggest the chicken pad see oew mmm)"}
{"text":"Terrific little strip-mall restaurant, run by friendly people, and most importantly -- everyone loved their dinners!  We go with friends on Friday nights, and a few people order the eggplant (which normally I hate, but this one's pretty good.)  For me, the Mango Chicken has a wonderful sweet taste and the chicken stays crispy.  Same for the Orange Beef  -- crunchy till the end (previously called the Bangkok 9 Beef, or the Strip Beef.)  I do not like the Pad Thai, too fishy.  But my friend loved the fish filet, and used rice to soak up all the tasty juices off the plate.  The lettuce wraps were ok ... but nothing better than I make at home, def not better than PF Changs, my go-to for lettuce cups."}
{"text":"I love this place. I have been coming a long time and it has always been great. My husband likes spicy, so he goes for those kind of dishes. I like not spicy, so I go for the assorted vegetable with chicken. Great sauce, great prices."}
{"text":"We ordered to go, and the food was not great. We will not eat here again.
 We ordered the red curry chicken. It was watered down like soup, and other than the hot chile, there wasn't much flavor in it.  We ordered the chicken satay. My 6 year old said,\" How am I supposed to eat this, it is so hard?\" It was so hard and dry she couldn't even bite into it. We ordered the ginger chicken- again watery broth and you couldn't even taste the ginger."}
{"text":"I've never had bad food from here. It's always amazing and their service is great! They've even fixed in order that I messed up with no fuss at all!"}
{"text":"This has been my go to Thai Resturant for years. Although I have never came to Yelp this place because it was my secret hidden gem for Pad Thai and their Thai Tea. This is a go to Thai Resturant if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Great prices and excellent customer service, but flavors just weren't there for me. Enjoyed the fried rice but was disappointed in their curry and papaya salad :-(."}
{"text":"Second time around. Tum Yum soup is the best here. And best Thai iced tea. Service is good. Always get seated right away."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices!! My favorite is the green curry."}
{"text":"Went here for Christmas Eve and the people are very nice and polite. I ordered a lot of food to-go and the food was really good. My favorite was the salt and pepper pork chop, and the egg rolls. One of the workers (maybe he was the owner) asked me how many people are going to be eating and I told him about 10, and he ended up giving me 10 free egg rolls. He also helped us get the food in my car. I don't usually get a lot of customer service from asian restaurants, so I was surprised with this restaurant. I'm definitely going to be coming back."}
{"text":"I was hoping to find another good Thai place. Nope, not this place. I did love that we could order completely online and pick it up, but my love stops there.

I ordered the Spicy Noodle that came with chicken, shrimp and squid. The squid was more like a squid version of a chicken nugget! The chicken was sooo dry and it had like 2 shrimp. The flavor was spicy, but not a flavorful spicy. I will say that the noodles were nice and done. It also had no sauce at all. 

My Mom ordered the Mongolian Chicken. In ordering online I put in the notes that her's was not be very spicy. Wow, her's was spicier then mine and the chicken was soooo dry! 

My husband got the Pad See Oiw with pork. His lacked flavor as well and had very dry pork. If his had the sauce it was supposed to have it at least would have been bearable.

Overall, I will say the portion size was nice, but it wasn't tasty so that really didn't matter. 

I'll stick with other places that I know are good. Meh explains it ALL!"}
{"text":"Always delicious. Always prompt. Can't go wrong with this place. The pad see ew and the fried rice is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Not only is the food delicious, the staff are so nice and welcoming. I enjoying dining in or ordering to go from an establishment that has amazing customer service."}

{"text":"Awwwwwkay! Where do I start ? Mm oh yeah after we ordered we got this mee Krob that I thought was just for us to chow down but to find out it actually serves double purpose first you play a game and it's like playing where's Waldo. Now, the tofu on this mee Krob will play Waldo ... Keep digging, keep stirring in this mountain of fried colored red fried noodle and you might get a price if you find the tofu. Dang Bro! Talking about needle on a haystack. Well I gave up. I just went for it and i still didn't get justice in my noodles...it tasted like a fried noodle with sweet chili sauce. I say hey \" should have ordered lumpia with this\". Tea ? Mmmm it's like \"give this people tea from the bag we used earlier it will still work \". Sigh ! Can't taste nothing . It's cool tho' I put some generic Splenda on that tea and \" Boy Behold\" it tasted better. Panang Curry ? It's like coconut chicken only but since it's Thai restaurant it can be Panang. Hey it works ! Be happy, find out on your own. It could just me :) it could be good on your taste bud. !"}
{"text":"Despite the low-star rating, this may be a place you want to try.  Chinese can be a real preference driven food, and there are other people here who really enjoyed Bangkok 9, and the place it run by extremely friendly people.  Also note, I had the Chinese, not the Thai food, so you may experience something different.

Our order contained a couple Sweet & Sour dishes, and they did not come breaded.  Also, their egg rolls are more like spring rolls."}
{"text":"Food is good for the price. Had the Crab Meat Fried Rice and Pad Thai. Pad Thai is bright pink and pretty tasteful. First time I've seen crab meat fried rice, pretty decent. Probably will return since it's close to my job."}
{"text":"Oh Bangkok 9.
I miss living around the corner  from you.

Every time I've ordered or dined in here, I've had great service, and great food.

The Golden Bags are a revelation.
I love curry...my favorites are the yellow, the panang, and the masaman.  

I'm going to have to go back soon, I'm craving good curry!"}
{"text":"Awesome food! One of our favorite spots :-). The Chef's fried rice and bbq chicken is phenomenal."}

{"text":"I usually come here during my lunch break. 11-3pm. It starts at 5.95. More for shrimp. 
1. Red curry chicken
2. Green curry chicken 
3. Panang curry beef 
4. Eggplant tofu 
5. Pad see ew 
Lunches come with egg drop soup, white rice, and fried egg roll

- Fast service. Food ready within 5-10min. It's not too hectic where it will take longer than an hour to eat. I'm usually in and out in 30 minutes. 
- Curry is pretty good, but thin. needs more spice. 
- Eggplant tofu, not enough eggplant. 
- Chinese broccoli not in Pad see ew. Regular broccoli.
- Beef and chicken are tender. 
- Left over spice rack.
- I feel that food is already made, just microwaved? Not too fresh?
- Quality is not the best, but for lunch, I rank this place great! Satifying for what it's worth."}
{"text":"Great Thai Food!!! Awesome service and prices are great! One of the best places for Thai I've been to hands down. Pad Thai is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years. Lemme keep it simple, simply the best Thai ever. We always try other places and keep coming back here.

Plus the prices and service are amazing!!"}
{"text":"This is our usual spot for Thai food. The staff is friendly and they're really good at remembering their customers. I've seen them start putting in an order as soon as a regular comes in. Customer service is never an issue here. 

The food is always pretty satisfying here. There have been some items I've ordered that were just ok. But, the usual items I order are always delicious and flavorful. The 3 items we order just about every time we're here are the shrimp fried rice, pad Thai, and the Cashew Nut Delight with chicken. The shrimp fried rice has tons of large shrimp and they give you the option to add the tomatoes and onions. The Pad Thai is a good one, though they use a thinner noodle instead of the thicker, wider noodles that are typical of other Pad Thai's. Theirs comes with both chicken and shrimp in a standard order so no need to pay extra for shrimp. The Cashew Nut Delight has a nice balance of flavors and you can adjust the spiciness to your liking. Comes with lots of veggies and, of course, cashews. 

I love the smaller, intimate setting of the restaurant. The service is fast and the staff is attentive. They also have decent lunch specials. I'll keep coming back to get my Thai fix."}
{"text":"Decent Thai and Chinese food. Prices are pretty much on par with similar restaurants. Portions are big enough to be shared with a friend, or save some for later or just pig out now!
Our group of 7 came in for lunch. We were well taken care of, the staff was very nice and accommodating. Some of the dishes we got were Mongolian Beef, Pad Thai, Spicy Noodle, Curry Panang, and Fried Rice. I think the chicken was a bit dry. Shrimp and beef were very good. All the vegetables were fresh and crisp. All the meals had good flavor but minimal spice or heat. You can ask them to kick up the heat or add your own if you like it hot.
I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Recently got delivery for the first time from Bangkok 9. While in person I usually find that their food is just OK, it did not translate well to delivery. The food arrived just bland and underseasoned. Not enjoyable. Have to say the people on the phone and the delivery guy were still super nice though!"}
{"text":"Service is always on point and the staff is always humble and welcoming! Love this place!! Feels like family! And the food is always how we ask for!"}
{"text":"Amazing place for lunch or dinner. The staff is incredible and the food is even better. One of my many favorites is the thai wraps. I recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"My family went here for my birthday yesterday, and we all ordered a variety of dishes - orange chicken, pad thai, \"yum tofu\" and a side of cream cheese wontons. We were all very impressed by the food, and even had enough to take as leftovers today! The wait staff was great, and was quick to refill our drinks or get us anything we needed. I look forward to returning here, and trying out a new dish."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for Pad Thai. I usually call in ahead of time for a to go order and I'm always greeted with a friendly person. The to-go serving size is generous to say the least. You can choose a slickness level and they give you and extra portion of hot oil to mix in if you want more spice. The best part about their Pad Thai is that it comes with chicken and shrimp automatically for only $8.95! Flavor, spice, and overall quality of this dish is fantastic for such a low price."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for 10 years. We love this place itd our go to place. Food is great and the price is even better!"}
{"text":"I am such a fan of this place. First off, we came in here once, for like 10 minutes. Ordered the Pad Thai, Original style cooked in sweet and sour sauce. 

Every time we walk in the door, the waitress knows what we want, and how we order it. Now I added Chicken Satay to my order. Sometimes the Pad Thai is clumped together, but nothing a little sriracha cant fix.

Spicy level is from 0-10!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service!  Everything is fresh and tasty.  I love the pork in garlic sauce.  All the appetizers are delightful, but my favorite is the lettuce wrap.  Service is superb.  Once you visit a couple of times, they remember you and even your favorite dish.  Place is beautiful and very clean.  Best Thai in town!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to get a cheap lunch that is very filling and quite satisfying for the taste buds! Lunch specials are $5.95, and it comes with soup or salad and an egg roll with your main entree. You can get many entrees like Pad Thai, Yellow Curry, Mongolian Beef, etc. with your lunch special. Not too bad for a local Thai place...

The lunch special is only available Monday-Friday. The restaurant is open 7 days a week. Lunch is 11am-3pm, and Dinner is 3pm-10pm."}
{"text":"Literally the worst pad thai ever. Something must've gone wrong because my pad thai doesn't even look like the pictures posted on here. Mine is bland and tastes like they mixed some sweet and sour sauce in just to get a reddish color."}
{"text":"Please do not go here! I went here today to just try it out and I'm sorry I did... This place needs a health inspector asap! A roach crawled out from behind our booth we were sitting at.....when I look behind the booth, all I see is rotting food and trash. I think I saw mice poop too:O"}
{"text":"Love the panang curry chicken! The kra prow is really good too. Went today for some quick takeout and the service is friendly and fast. I was even asked if I wanted water while I waited.

Prices are reasonable and the portions are pretty large by today's standards. Most dishes come with rice and you choose the level of spice you want. Beware the hot stuff! Even the mild spicy has a kick to it, but the spicy stuff will knock your socks off! 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Disgusting! Undercooked , dirty , unseasoned food. How this place has any good review is mindblowing. They seem to only care about how fast the food can come out and not the QUALITY of the food. Undercooked wonton's in the soup, dirty mussels in the seafood entree (you can see the dirt hanging off the shell!), zero flavoring in any of the dishes and sour tasting cheese puff (as if it had gone bad). We will NEVER eat there again and certainly will NOT recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Hard to find a good Chinese/Thai place to eat and this place is pretty good! Not the best i have ever had but i definitely was not disappointed. :)"}
{"text":"All I can say is, crap... total crap... You folks that gave this \"thai\" food place 5 stars needs to taste some REAL Thai food.  We ordered papaya salad and it was so sweet, never had that before.  The beef larb was just plain beef w s few pieces of lettuce and some lime juice.  The BBQ chicken was frickin' FRIED, wtf?!?!?!?!   Can't even make Thai tea right either   The glass of water was scrumptious though"}
{"text":"I have come here maybe three times randomly over the past 6 years. They haven't changed much, which is good. I remember it being more fancy when I was younger.
It still is a cute restaurant. The service is by far fantastic. The ladies that serve are very nice and probably the best thing about this place. 

The food is ok. I'm less of a meat eater so I don't prefer much of the menu, but they do have really nice shrimp dishes, and I really like the soup! I got the Tom Yum. Sour and spicy, I really enjoyed it. A few too many mushrooms, but it was great. The summer roll was really great and fresh! It had shrimp and cucumber. However the dark sauce they give you for dipping is hideous. Sorry to say its looks like chocolate sauce with nuts on it, and kind of tastes just as sweet. Seemed straight out of a bottle. I used soy sauce instead and it was fine. 

My mom got the eggplant delight with shrimp and tofu. Very good. She  enjoyed it. we also got the veggie rice. Very good as well. 
They introduced me to Tsingtao beer and I'm all about it. Nice and light.


Next time I would like to try pineapple rice. That and the honey walnut shrimp looks amazing."}
{"text":"Everything I order from here tastes fresh and delicious. I usually try the curries and boba, with some kind of soup. I order something new every time, and I am always happy."}
{"text":"Both our dishes were delicious!! Even the $1 size of rice was great haha. The tofu was cooked perfectly and all the sauces used were layered with so many flavors. Great prices too. What really impressed us was the service. Fast, attentive and so polite. You can tell they're customer service focused. Great food delivered fast with a smile!! I also loved that they had salt scrub for your hands to sample in the bathroom.  :)"}
{"text":"I love this place for quick and tasty delivery. Their yellow curry and chicken pad Thai are great, as are their crab Rangoon appetizers. I've been ordering delivery from here for years and they're as friendly as they come."}
{"text":"Love the restaurant, the food, and especially the staff. It's to the point where they already know my takeout phone number and what I love ordering. My absolute favorite restaurant."}
