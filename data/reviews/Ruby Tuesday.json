{"text":"I've been to this restaurant 2 times. The food was good but they're salad bar needs attention.  The have good items in the salad bar but it's never stocked.  I want there for lunch yesterday and the salad bar was missing many items and it didn't get restocked the entire time I was there."}
{"text":"My first time ever at a Ruby Tuesdays. They had a great burger deal going on that I found on Yelp so we opted to go there. It was $6.95 for a few variety of specialty burgers. We were seated right away and I showed the waiter the deal right away and he said yes it was a special they had. The waiter was talkative and related to us with talking about several things. We got our food quickly. The burgers were just ok, nothing extra special or flavorful. Since it was Tuesday the sign outside said kids eat free, so we were even more stoked to try it out. One of my kids ordered the sliders and the other chicken strips. We heard the table next to us who also had two kids comment to the waiter that they were charged for the kids meals. When we got our bill, same thing had to bring it up to the waiter that we thought kids eat free. He aplogized and said he forgot it was Tuesday. I'm sure it's just their standard practice to charge unless the customer complains or notices it. So beware if it's a Tuesday to tell your waiter  and make sure you look at your bill. Not to impressed with the food for the price. Reminded me of a  Friday's or Chili's."}
{"text":"First bad impression when you walk in and the Host is on his cell phone and takes about a minute to just point you to the \"second booth to the right\".  Kind of don't like to see the \"neck tat's\" either.  Food was just average for an $80 dinner for two with only a beer and glass of wine.  Wifey did say that the BB Ribs were excellent.  Grilled Zucchini was bland and fries are fries.  Had the Appetizer with Chicken Strips (VG), Cheese Sticks (Avg), Southwest Egg Rolls (Pretty Good), Some Kind of Smothered Fries (pretty good too).  I had the Shrimp Trio - Fried were big and good, Scampi (or at least an attempt at) lacked any flavor at all, and the some kind of Oriental Shrimp were cold and tasteless.  Only came because Culver's was out of Walleye - Should have headed down the road."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch with some business associates.  It didn't take me long to remember why I stay away from these crappy chains.  Food was okay at best, service was slow, it was loud and uncomfortable, and the prices say that I paid for the \"experience\".  Meh.... never again."}
{"text":"I come to this Ruby Tuesday usually once or twice a month and they always have great service! The servers are all super friendly and helpful. And the waitress that has the area that I usually sit in recognizes me and can normally remember my order. Great food and environment"}
{"text":"The service is good, the food was properly prepared,the place is clean, the menu just doesn't do it for me. I just can't find anything I love it's ok just my personal taste runs a bit different than the typical chain restaurants...if you are ok with chain restaurants this one is top notch."}
{"text":"My wife and I had gone to Ruby Tuesday's tonight and we thought that the service and food was going to be really good like all the other times we ate at a Ruby Tuesday in the Phoenix area. Well tonight we were WRONG. The waiter who was probably in his late teens or early 20's had came and took our drink order and came back about 5  minutes later with our drinks  and took our food order. One of the times the waiter passed our table, my wife had asked for some sugar for her ice tea, the waiter in turn said that it was there on the table and when my wife showed him that there was none he insinuated that she had placed the sugar packets with the holder as well as the salt and pepper grinders in her purse.  2 tables came in and were seated right near us and their orders for drinks and food was taken after ours. The waiter kept telling us that our food was coming and after the both tables around us were served their food, I had asked him if it was going to be much longer. The waiter looked at my wife and said \"He didn't know, he didn't cook the food, he just served it\" all in a rude tone and manner. We had asked to speak with the manager and instead of him going and telling the manager that we wanted to speak with him/or her, he went to the hostess stand and came up to our table and said that the one table was there for 47 minutes and we were there only 20. If I would of realized at that time what the exact time it was that he said that, I would of corrected him on the spot since we had reservations for 7:00 pm and arrived at the restaurant at 6:57pm.and it was approximately 7:45 .After the waiter had \"informed\" us on how long we were waiting, he then went and got the manager. We informed the manager on what had transpired and told her to cancel our food order and to tell me what we did owe for the soft drinks and salad but she said not to worry about it and to call the general manager in the morning about this situation. She then went and got his business card for me to call him, which I plan on doing first thing in the morning."}
{"text":"On our girls recommendation I ordered the crab. Not great....but polite and the rest of the meal was good.  I would go back. It had a pleasant atmosphere"}
{"text":"My husband and I usually love this location. We always sit at the bar and usually come mid week. Not sure if the staff is different on weekends, but this experience was not like our usual (we came on a saturday). The bartender was nice but you can tell it was only because  it's his job. He kept very minimal conversation and was rarely even behind the bar. My drink was empty for about 10 minutes. Normally my husband would have a few beers, however, this time he only had one because we felt rushed. We weren't even halfway finished with our food when the bartender asked if we wanted dessert..when we said no he immediately brought the check. From the time he brought the check until we left he wasn't behind the bar at all. Not even a goodbye when he saw us get up from the bar to leave. Like I said, when we usually come during the week, whoever the bartender is, is wonderful.   The whole atmosphere felt completely different. All the staff was congregated near the kitchen/bar area..we could hear their conversations and see them on their phones. The hostess was rarely even at the hostess stand. We watched more than 3 groups walk out with no one saying goodbye. Everyone that walked in the door stood there for a little bit until she saw them and walked over. At one point three employees were sitting in the dining area. It just felt very unprofessional and almost high-school ish. We've never had this experience at this location before and are wondering if maybe there's new management or something? If I was the manager I would be embarrassed (and hope the owner would appreciate a review like this letting them know what goes on behind the scenes).   The food was great..no complaints there. The only thing that seemed a little different was the salad bar (the broccoli salad and pasta salad were super dry). We did, however, see two different employees walk behind the food prep line while we were sitting at the bar (which we've also never seen before.)   Like I said, normally we have a positive experience here, so we will come back again mid-week and see if we just caught them on an off day. Either way, whether it's a weekday or weekend, the experience should be the same."}
{"text":"I will never dine in here again. I thought the lettuce in the salad bar would be fresh, but it was very dry. I also ordered a baked potato and it was also very old and dry. I told the waiter I did not like anything I ate and he just said,\" I'll take it off your bill\". He didn't even offer or suggested anything else on the menu. He obviously didn't care. My appetite got spoiled. My daughter ate the small cheese pizza and even though it was hot and fresh, it tasted like a can of tomato sauce was poured on top.  Not even a manager went over to see what was exactly wrong with the food. The waiter seemed lazy and forgetful. This was my first and last time here. The salads taste better at the steakhouses I go to."}
{"text":"We've been dining at Ruby Tuesday for about 6 or 7 years now (ever since it opened in Avondale).  There have been some real misses in years' passed, but every visit in 2012 has been enjoyable.  Tonight's dinner was simply perfect.  I had a steak with potato and the wife had the grilled chicken breast (she had them leave the bbq sauce in the kitchen) with a side of grilled zucchini.  We both opted for the salad bar. Every bite was delicious and cooked perfectly.  Even the silly little cheesy \"biscuits\" were good tonight (those can be hit or miss, but tonight they were definitely good).  The service has been excellent this year, too, and we're noticing that the staff isn't changing as quickly as it did for a while.  Must be a new manager or something.  Whatever it is, the prices are good, the menu is simple but has good choices and the classic RT salad bar is never a disappointment.  The interior decor is very comfortable.  We both like that they keep the lights a little low, makes for a nicer meal."}
{"text":"I generally don't love chain restaurants, nor do I feel the need to review them because of their general mediocrity, but being from the SF bay, Ruby Tuesday was new to me and I always like to give new-to-me restaurants a shot.  Their website makes everything look so delicious.  That was my first mistake though, right?  Never believe the pictures.  Having gone at an off-peak hour (about 8:30 p.m.) in an off-peak season (summer, so I heard the waitress tell another table) I would've expected prompt service and fresh food.  However, this was not so.  Our waitress had a total of 2 tables and she had gotten so caught up in chatting with the other table that our food sat under heat lamps for who knows how long.  (You can always tell when that happens by how hot your plate is when they serve it to you.)  Our burgers were over-cooked, almost to the point of being rubbery, and the fries were luke-warm.  Ate enough to get full and threw the rest away.  Oh well, now I know."}
{"text":"Terrible Food! Service was a joke! Paid $14 for a piece of chicken you would buy from Sam's club bulk frozen section. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME! This place will be out of business guaranteed!!!"}
{"text":"Ruby Tuesday makes a Triple Prime hamburger that us to die for - with the added bonus of an option for gluten-free buns. It's been difficult to find a place that has a great hamburger AND a gluten-free free option, so this was a wonderful find. While the rest of the food us good, too, I have to admit I only cone for the hamburger. If you're ordering, make sure you pay the extra for the Triple Prime - it is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience we've ever had at a restaurant. There were 3 servers working plus a trainee we were one of 5 tables in the restaurant. It took almost 15 minutes for us to order. The food was just above room temperature. I paid in cash and waited 10 minutes for change. With the exception of the hostess, the entire staff was back in the kitchen. Bad food and bad service. Gas is cheap, drive an extra 10 minutes and go to a different location. I would give it a 0 if I could"}
{"text":"For the kids its great especially since they have one free kids meal on tuesdays. But the chef was not able to get my order right. I asked for a well done steak and he sent it out medium rare.  Sent it back to cook some more and it was still pink and the outside was charred. No bueno."}
{"text":"Great food! Just tried the new zucchini mini cakes. Yum! All their food here is so flavorful and the salad bar is always a favorite. Always leave this place satisfied!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorites as a family-friendly place to eat with our toddler.  This location has a very fresh, clean, and well-stocked garden bar - which my son loves to sample!  I typically get the turkey minis with fries (always fresh tasting and crispy), and of course the salad bar.  My husband has gotten steak, mashed potatoes, and green beans - all of which were very good.  I especially vouch for the green beans, they have a very nice seasoning and are quite crisp.  I would advise against their pasta dishes, they tend to taste rather salty and \"casseroley\" if you know what I mean.  Great service here, too!"}
{"text":"I've only been to Ruby Tuesday twice...the first time a few years ago and the second time a few months ago while in AZ visiting family.    The last time I visited, I ordered the jumbo crabcake sandwich ($11.99).  I loved it, surprisingly.  The burger was packed with alot of crab and was seasoned and cooked properly.    The others ordered: - Shrimp scampi & steak ($16.99) - good  - Classic cheeseburger ($6.99) - good  I tried a glass of their red sangria ($4) and was pleasantly surprised by how good it was.    I went in not expecting much from Ruby Tuesday, but left quiet satisfied with our experience."}
{"text":"Everyone doesn't look happy and has attitudes , but my server was by far the happiest person working she always kept a smile on her face (: and the Shrimp Fondue was amazing"}
{"text":"Words cannot express how much I enjoyed dining at this taste bud-enthusiastic establishment. Not only is this place at a central location of the seven hills area, but the employees here have shown their upmost affection through a delicious meal, mind-relaxing atmosphere, and clean laboratory. My recommendation, if you're going here for your first time, take a good look at the menu, because by time your appetizer arrives you'll have spent but a mere few dollars on the very food that we cannot get enough of! The manager comes around and asks us if we're enjoying our meal, the staff is extremely prompt and takes our orders right away, and the food is cooked according to your preference upon order. I sense not only an enthusiastic consumer who will make another 50 trips here year-round, or a customer who is not easily impressed, but a place that I will be sure to leave a thousand more reviews for. Please, take some time to come here and enjoy the great food and vibe-welcome atmosphere. 6/5 stars!"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant with a friendly, excellently attentive staff! The All-You-Can Eat Salad Bar is simply amazing! It contains a nice selection of fresh vegetables,fresh pasta,and potato salad.   I loved the real bacon piece, the raw sliced zucchini, and the homemade pumpernickel croutons.   Also, there are several entree selections on the menu, to choose from: steak, seafood,gourmet hamburgers, gourmet turkey burgers, pasta, chicken dishes, and sides.   I was pleasantly surprised when I was told by my Server, that I could create my own \"Specialty\" Pasta dish.   I choose the sauce that I wanted (roasted red pepper marinara), the meats andouille sausage and ground beef, sauteed onions, sauteed mushrooms,and linguini noodles-- topped with freshly grated Parmesan cheese! It was delicious!  The appetizers are scrumptious, also! Especially the Shrimp Fondue with homemade Chips!  Additionally, Ruby Tuesday offers a \"Lunch Special.\" You can receive $2 off of your Lunch, if you eat at the Bar. Be sure to ask the Bartender for a Discount Card."}
{"text":"Very good value. Had a hard time finding it (two other locations listed on their web site and in the GPS were closed). Service and good were both good. Family of five ate for $80 plus tip. Two kids ate of kids' menu and adults had crab cakes, seafood trio and chicken linguine. Then we shared the cheesecake, which was awesome!!"}
{"text":"The \"new\" pulled pork sandwich I had today at lunch was AWFUL!  The overall size was small with little meat.  It had hunks of dry pork, not tender pulled pork.  There was very little BBQ sauce.  The bun was very low end and dry.  Only two pickle chips.  The only good thing was the sweet potato fries, but I had to pay extra for them.  Bottom line, DON'T get the pulled pork sandwich."}
{"text":"Aretha Franklin was right:  Chains are for fools.   Ruby Tuesday's has always sort've blown me away when it comes to how hard they try to not be a TGI Fridays clone but yet still fail miserably.   The food at Ruby Tuesday's is predictably average with service that varies from piss-poor to pretty darned good.  Most recently I enjoyed the Ruby's Minis (sliders) at the bar and the wife enjoyed a broccoli and cheese soup and the salad bar.   The soup was salty and not great but the salad bar and sliders were  yummy.   Plus, they have dos XX lager (not amber) on tap which is a rare and tasty find!  Hooray for Tuesdays on a Monday..errr..or something."}
{"text":"Rename it ruby seven days cuz I'll cone here any day of the week. Nom nom nom"}
{"text":"I come here every thursday with 2 friends. For over 2 years now. I love the food here,however at times it can be on the salt side. But my burgers and steaks always come to the table at the right temp. I have never had to send back. And I am very pickie on how my meats are cooked. The servers r awesome... U go Eddy.   The mix drinks and apps r great too."}
{"text":"Staff doesn't know what medium well means. Burgers were raw inside and manager claims medium well means some pink. Anyone working in a restaurant knows this isn't true. Manager then asked us if we wanted our burgers back on the grill or if we wanted fresh ones. Really? Yeah, scrape the cheese, bacon, and BBQ sauce off and put my already cut Burger back on the grill.. New burgers we're fine, but we weren't comped for the inconvenience."}
{"text":"Omg!  Our dinner was awesome!.  We both had the Hickory Bourbon Salmon and it was superb! We even had a trip to the salad bar.  The baked potato and fresh steamed broccoli was so yummy too!  Too bad we had no room for dessert!  Love Ruby Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at Ruby's medina for dinner, had a half rack of baby back ribs Texas dusted. The seasoning was great however in my book half a rack is not 4 bones. Disappointed to say the least. Left hungry, Won't be returning. Texas Roadhouse definitely takes better care of you for the money."}
{"text":"Went to this Tempe Market Place Ruby Tuesday today for the first time and the service and food was absolutely wonderful. Our server Logan was absolutely phenomenal! When he says \" it's been my pleasure to serve you\" he means just that, as he displays it in his attitude and overall service. The food was cooked to perfection and I mean deeeeeeelicious!!! Based on my experience today, I can say that I highly recommend this location! Ask for Logan!!"}
{"text":"Ruby tuesday is the shit. Great food.  Great servers:) pretzel burgers are to die for!"}
{"text":"I usually go to this chain because the food is consistently good and service is usually professional. I was disappointed when I found out the local one is so bad. I tried it twice and had really bad service. Both times they were barely half occupied and we still ended up at tables that were clearly not cleaned or even wiped down. When my wife asked for clean silverware since her fork was dirty the waitress wiped it with a napkin and handed it back. After insisting on a clean set, she just swapped hers with a set from an empty table. Both times we waited 20 minutes for someone to take our orders and another 45 minutes for the drinks and food. I can kinda understand an hour for food, but for a Diet Coke? Really?   I'd give it one star except for the fact that the cook did a pretty good job on the food and it tasted good both time we went. I won't be returning and I now second guess going to other locations with this chain."}
{"text":"While John's (our server) performance was impeccable, I doubt we'll be returning any time soon. My crab cake was VERY fishy tasting and Tuesday's only offered a very blah cocktail sauce - no teriyaki, soy or other flavor masker. My bride's chicken fresco was noticeably dry and her favorite vegetable, steamed broccoli, was not warm enough to melt the \"butter\" that John served after being asked for it. Her mashed cauliflower (which she couldn't bring herself to insist I try) was \"not quite what I remember\".  We didn't partake of the salad bar ... it was nicely presented but compared to Dessey's or a Sizzler it was seriously lacking.  Bottom line, if we get another ($10 max) 2 for 1 coupon we might return for a (see previous ratings) highly rated turkey burger. On the other hand, In-N-Out  is hard to resist when it come to burgers.  BTW, I'm glad we didn't take the (5 & 13) kids with us. There was nothing that would have appealed to them on the menu and we'd have had to stop at McDonald's to feed them later."}
{"text":"The food is overpriced compared to its its taste.. Pops are not fizzy.. Theres this weird smell in the restaurant.  Got 2 broken peices of onion rings with my fries..wonder if it was on the house or they charged me  for that also..  All in all very average experience..  Would i come back??   No!"}
{"text":"The décor was upbeat and the lighting was perfect. The salad bar you pass up front tasted as delicious as it looked. Vegetables fresh and crisp. I want to give a shout out to our server Riley for excellent service. My husband ordered the Jalapeno burger and loved it. I ordered the chicken bella with baked spaghetti squash and was blown away. We had a great time. Restaurant was upscale without being fussy."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I've been to this Ruby Tuesdays about 4 times before and all those times have been a positive experience. On this visit it was New Years day and we arrived around 3 PM for a late lunch. It took a few minutes for the waiter to get our drink order but other than that the service was just fine, he kept us stocked in bread while we waited on our food and continued to check on us frequently. Both of us ordered the Chicken Tenders when they arrived it looked as if the batter on the tenders was cooked in month old grease it was black looking instead of golden but not burnt the tenders were saturated in grease. The picture on the menu looked great but the product was far from the picture. This is something the cook should have never sent out, much less the waiter serving it. So if you go here stay away from the chicken tenders. Since this is a 1 in 5 bad experience at this Ruby's I'll give them another chance but it will be awhile."}
{"text":"It's was okay. Nothing too special if you're looking for a place to just grab something to eat."}
{"text":"I hate chains, but I love this place!  The best thing is the service.  You can tell the staff is very well trained.  (12 yrs in the business, I should know).  The food is also very good, and hot.  The ribs are great.  The lemonade is very good, lots of flavors, and free refills!  I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best. The bartender looked amish, and our drinks tasted like we were in the middle of prohibition.  It was only 830pm on a sat, and they were cleaning up around us like they couldn't wait to get out of there.  Would have had better luck at McDonald's."}
{"text":"Went here because everything else was packed and we were in the area. RT had no wait and it was already passed out youngest's bedtime. Basically there is absolutely no reason to go here. The food is \"blah\" and the prices aren't cheaper than other comparable spots. Can't see how this place will stay in business much longer. It's was a total choke to go here."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!! The salad bar was wiped out and not restocked. It was 4:30 on a Friday. They were out of croutons, ranch dressing, green peas, ham and everything else was low or disgusting. They also took cottage cheese off the salad bar a few years ago. Bad decision. Awful experience. They lost my business for good!!"}
{"text":"Just went for the salad bar.  As always everything looked fresh and great. I had the salad with a soup of the day (broccoli and cheese). Waitress was a younger lady with blondish brown hair, she was all smiles and for the most part prompt.  We had to find her for the bill. Strawberry lemonade is out of this world, they put it in a fancy tall glass and accent it with a leaf of mint. I would go back even before mothers day."}
{"text":"After a very unhappy visit on 12/4/15, not only did the Ruby Tuesday district office team contact us, but so did the local General Manager.  I was asked to submit a detailed letter of our experience and then my husband was on the phone with the GM, Darius, for maybe an hour.  Our concerns were validated and we received many apologies.  Darius invited all of us to come back and give them a chance to prove themselves. We went on Monday night and it was a FANTASTIC dining experience.  Every food item was cooked perfectly.  The Caramel Apple Martini is phenomenal and the caramel apple flat bread dessert was to die for.  The BBQ ribs were fall off the bone tender and seasoned perfectly.  Hubby had steak and lobster and both were just right.  There were four in our party and we do not have one negative thing to say. Our service was excellent from the hostess, to server, to bartender, cook, and GM Darius.  It was an amazing meal and we WILL be back - don't ever take the Caramel Apple Martini off of the menu.  It is killer with the caramel swirled all around in the glass and fresh apple slices bobbing on top of my drink.  It is delicious and EVERYONE needs to go order one.  I promise, you won't regret it!  Thank you, Ruby Tuesdays, for giving excellent customer service and caring enough to contact us to make things right.  We loved our meal and our dining experience. Sheri K."}
{"text":"My food actually wasn't bad but it did get cold fast because it was so cold in the restaurant. I think they need to make it a little more comfortable. My boyfriend's fries came out cold but they did make them again and the manager made sure we were ok. The server was on top of things with refills, napkins, and she was friendly."}
{"text":"All I can say is, wow...Ruby Tuesday has really reinvented itself since I last went to one a year or so ago.  Their menu has completely changed from all burgers, steaks, and deep fried appetizers to something a little lighter, a litter fresher, and a little more up my ally.    Now, I'm not one for franchised family restaurants where screaming children and horribad decor can be found around any corner, but the guy wanted to show me his new office in Summerlin, it was late, and it was open.  I sat down very discouraged...what would I eat?  And then I spotted their Fresh Combinations section.  Quiche?  Mozzarella and tomato salad?  What?  I ended up getting the mini turkey burgers, subbing the fries for the mozzerella and tomato salad I spotted with the quiche, and the garden bar instead of the caesar salad.    Even their salad bar seems to have really improved.  Edamame and a myriad of other whole beans, many fresh lettuces, many neat salads (the green bean and red pepper salad, very refreshing!)  Of course all the standard salad bar fare is there too...don't worry!  And they had avocado ranch...it was green and lumpy and I could TASTE the avocado in it.  We also ordered the spinach artichoke dip as an appetizer, subbing celery sticks in for tortilla chips.  It was totally delicious and a great compliment with the fresh, crisp, baby celery hearts they gave us.  I was shocked, pleased, and very satisfied by the time we left.  Hopefully we'll stop by again for lunch if I'm ever in Summerlin to see guy during work."}
{"text":"This place is gross as fuck I've came here one other time and had the same experience this will be the last time I come to this place it's a shame because I used to love eating here the salad bar was my favorite part but now it looks like the food has been left out All day and never check for the lettuce wilting, my wife ordered a 6 oz steak and 3 oz of it was uneatable gristle the other 3 oz were not even cooked the right way and I won't even get started on my steak. None the less I will never come again"}
{"text":"THis restaurant is terrible my family and I were seated after waiting 15 min and was never waited on. We sat at our table for over 30 minutes and no one came to take our drink order much less food. IT was like we were not even there. This place has terrible service. Stay away"}
{"text":"Normally when we come here it is dead and now I know why.  First time I've seen a crowd here and they obviously don't know how to handle it. It took 25min to get our food at which point we just asked for it to go since we had plans.  After which it took another 20min to get my check and that was only after walking up to a manager.  Than another 10 for them to come get the check from the table and bring back my card.  They did give us a discount for the terrible service.  But that's not enough to bring us back."}
{"text":"I came to Ruby Tuesdays for lunch today.  Been out running errands,  not lookin my best and the hostess seated me in the far back corner away from other guests.   That's fine.. I don't really mind being hidden away like a dirty little secret. . Atleast it was quite.   My server was polite,  she took my drink order then brought me some biscuits with my Coke.  When she returned I ordered the Asiago peppercorn steak with grilled zucchini and mashed potatoes.  $14.99  Now just let me say I LUV A GOOD STEAK!  My steak was a perfectly prepared medium. Properly seasoned and delicious. My only complaint would be it wasn't large enough. . I could easily have devoured 18oz's of this steak.   The grilled zucchini was perfectly seasoned if a little undercooked.  The mashed potatoes however were rather unpalatable. I truly expected real potatoes not instant. If i'd known I would have ordered the baked potato. It's much harder to fake..  The server came and checked on me once but never offered to refill my coke.  When I was finished,  I headed for the hostess station to pay since the server hadn't brought me my check.  So.. order the steak,  only the steak, and nothing but the steak. ."}
{"text":"Quick choice without checking Yelp. We think of Ruby Tuesday as a safe bet for reasonably good food and good service. We assumed we could count on any Ruby Tuesday for this. Our assumption was incorrect.   No one else waiting and plenty of open seating, but it took an inordinate amount for us to be greeted and seated.   No utensils on the table. We got all the way through ordering and visiting the salad bar before we asked. Obviously we should not have had to do that.   Daughter ordered chocolate milk. Kudos  to the server for asking for a backup choice, but the reasoning was surprising: \"I'm not sure if we have any. I know we were out yesterday and the day before.\"  Turns out they did have it, but did management really let them go an entire weekend without it? If they didn't let that happen, then they have a problem with their wait staff telling customers things like that.   Wife's burger was not as ordered - had stuff specifically excluded during ordering (mayo, lettuce, tomato) but not stuff specifically ordered (pickles, onions). Got the attention of the first employee who came by (not our server), received cursory apology and promise to inform our server. Several minutes later, having not seen our server, I got up to ask the hostess if she could send the manager over.   When I got back to our table, I met the bartender, who was delivering a small plate with pickles and chopped onions. I thanked her, but told her that didn't solve the problem.  Manager arrived shortly thereafter and seemed to have a hard time understanding what \"no mayo\" means. He asked my wife what she wanted at least twice. I told him that she wanted what she ordered.   After the manager left, our sever finally came over. Server apologized and must have realized that the unwanted burger was still on our table. Server offered to take it away and we accepted. It was at this point that our long-empty salad plates were also taken away.   The food we eventually got, including the replacement burger, was fine.   Another lowlight of our time there was listening to the manager try to solve a switched check problem. I think one party was overcharged by a few dollars.  Manager seemed unable to clearly explain the resolution to the customer. I know check mix-ups happen, but I've never seen it happen in a restaurant with only five tables occupied."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant even though it's a chain.  I particularly like their Petite Lunches for the price and portion size.  Love the Chicken Fresco off the Petite Lunch menu.  The staff is pleasant and cheerful.  Atmosphere is nice, and the layout of the diningroom keeps the noise down to a minimum.  Salad bar is good, and the restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the chocolate cake was huge and ice cream I like how its tucked in corner haha only a person w real hunger and like ruby Tuesday will find like myself .. The waitress wasn't so friendly idk if it was out of fear of my scarf r she wanted to sit down but the server Tanya t. that did my order was good to me kudos\"for professionalism I went Aug 10,17 late afternoon.."}
{"text":"Seeing all the negative reviews almost made us not want to give this location a shot, but so glad we gave it a go. The hostess and waitress were super friendly and the waitress kept our drinks filled. The salad bar was well stocked and fresh. Our food was delicious and we will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Tonight I went to ruby Tuesday with my family. I got chicken tenders and they were delicious but I ordered some fries with it and they were a bit over seasoned. The waitress was very nice to us but it took a while to get our check. My dad got a chocolate cake and it was delightful. I had a good experience at ruby Tuesday."}
{"text":"Let's start with the salad bar which is well stocked, with a nice selection of mixed fields greens, spinach and your typical iceberg lettuce for the less adventurous. Moving to the middle of the salad bar we find sliced mushroom, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers, peas and other assorted veggies. They also have a broccoli salad which has shredded cheddar, bacon and a light dressing. Two things should be noted: One is that the bar has real bacon pieces and the other is their croutons. They are very dark, and look like pumpernickel but don't taste like it. What sets them apart from any other crouton I have ever had is that they are slightly crisp on the outside and soft and chewy in the middle. I can't get enough of them on my plate. They are delicious and fun to eat. There is also a nice selection of dressings as well. They also offer unsalted sunflower seeds to top off your salad. A nice touch. Another very classy touch is that the salad plates sit on an icy cold chilling plate so you always get a cold salad plate.  We had the shrimp fondue. Thick and cheesy with lots of baby shrimp. It was served with crisp, paper thin multicolored chips. An excellent appetizer.  Entrees: Parmesan Shrimp pasta - yum. Chicago baby back ribs (full rack of course), very tender meat which literally fell off the bone - yum. Dockside Grill Trio - tilapia was way too chewy, should be slightly firm and flaky. But our server took care of that right away. New Orleans Seafood - yum. Grilled Salmon - yum. Rib eye - first one - yum, second time way too fatty. But again our server took care of that right away. It should be noted that the rib eye portion is huge, practically filling the whole plate. Chef's Cut Sirloin - yum. The cooks know how to cook meat at the temp you order.   Now for the sides: Homemade cheese biscuits - yum. Roasted spaghetti squash - yum. Onion rings with chilli dipping sauce - yum.  Baked potato - hard to mess one of these up unless it's been in the oven for a few days.   Deserts: So far we have only tried one. The red velvet cupcakes. These come right out of the fridge. The texture is just right and the icing is thick, tasty and not cloying. A very tasty cupcake.  The service: Very attentive. We never have to ask for drink refills. Servers strike the right balance of friendliness and respecting our privacy.   Bottom line: Ruby Tuesday has become our favorite restaurant. The food is excellent with any missteps promptly remedied. The service is very good. The servers know how to do their job and the management we have met is very attentive as well. Expect to spend around $35 - $40 for two."}
{"text":"Despite the negative reviews, my experience was fantastic! We had a great server, and our food was delicious! Hopefully my next visit is just as good!"}
{"text":"Well we went to try it again and the 10 Employees that passed us never said a word. I had to ask if we were ever going to be seated and was told the hostess would be there shortly, we waited another 5 min and then just left for Olive Garden. So long suckers! No wonder your reviews are so low"}
{"text":"We were in this afternoon and we were both impressed!  It was our day off :) so we sat at the bar.  Our bartender, Victoria, was very knowledgeable and patient as we are not regulars so it took us a bit of time to decide and read through the extensive menu.  She even gave us suggestions even though she was so busy!  The salad bar was a great addition to our meal.  The food was good, the tv's were great, and the food arrived in an appropriate amount of time...Overall, we are so glad we stopped in and gave this local place a chance!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Awful service.  Wrong orders to our table.  First round of lemonade was delicious, second was awful.  We let them know and they brought us new ones that were equally awful (wouldn't you at least taste it if you had three customers with three different kinds say there was something very wrong?!). Most puzzling was that it took 10 minutes to bring our drinks each time, asked for a side of mayo-didn't come out with my order and I sat for 10 minutes waiting for it to come.  There were at least six servers that we saw and only ONE other table besides us!!  My burger was not only NOT what I ordered but it was cold and my daughter's bun was soggy.  Totally disappointing.  Not only will I never come to this Ruby Tuesdays again but I have no desire to try any others either.  The one bright spot was the hostess.  I wish I would have gotten her name, she was so helpful and was sure the manager would adjust the bill for the slooooow service and wrong orders-nope!  But she did take the lemonades off the check. I guess that's better than nothing."}
{"text":"Got take away from the restaurant and enjoyed it. They told me over the phone that it would be 15 minutes. When I arrived 15 minutes later my food was hot and waiting for me. The bartender even gave me a lemonade on the house! The food portions were great and the service was quick."}
{"text":"We came in for a free birthday meal and the service was spectacular.  The hostess put the game on for us and the manager visited our table.  Johnathan was our server and he was awesome.  We've never been in before so he recommended some items, which turned out great.  Johnathan had great customer service and the whole staff, even the cooks, went above and beyond. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Went here with my softball team that is traveling 21 people. They did a good job seating us right away and the service was good. Appreciated them getting the food out right away and keeping the water flowing! The only thing that wasn't good here was the salad bar had bologne instead of ham. I have been to many Ruby Tuesdays and never had that happen. I always look forward to the ham!"}
{"text":"I normally love Ruby Tuesday, but not the Gastonia location.  It's too small and the tables are cramped in.  If you have to wait for a table, you'll stand at the door where diners are only inches away.  Very awkward for all."}
{"text":"Food was good. . Great selection but just a little pricey. . Management very interested in customer service. . Need to go back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"This was our first time in this location (we usually go to Great Northern) and it will also be our last. The restaurant was not clean at all. I hate when they bus a table and don't wipe the seat. Floor needed vacuumed badly, blinds were dusty and don't get me started on the restrooms - yuck. None of the staff seemed to notice or maybe they didn't care?"}
{"text":"Seriously a surprisingly good salad bar! Ordered a fairly standard grilled chicken sandwich, and substituted the fries with the salad bar. The salad bar addition made the sandwich more than worth it. Very fresh spring mix, baby spinach, and variety of toppings including edamame. The pasta salads were pretty good. Their \"famous\" croutons were buttery, crunchy on the outside, nice chew on the interior. Definitely get a few of these."}
{"text":"As some of the reviews below have noted, this Ruby Tuesdays location's service sometimes isn't the best.   I've always been pleased with the food, especially the salad bar. With a trip to the salad bar,  their portion size makes it to where I can usually take the entree and enjoy it at a separate meal.  I've certainly never experienced anything at this location to warrant any of the negative and nasty reviews some have posted below."}
{"text":"I ate here cause it was New Years eve and I needed a place to eat quick to energize myself before a night of heavy partying. They had some $1 beer specials and the mini burgers and fries were not too bad . This place is just too dark and dingy though. I would give it  2 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"So I only gave them the one star for the salad bar. It was clean and the veggies/toppings were fresh and crisp. The food we ordered though was pretty terrible. Kids got popcorn shrimp with no complaints and hubby got a burger that was ok. MIL got a steak that was not cooked the way she asked and very tough. I got the chicken Bella which made me really sick and just did not taste right...definitely over seasoned. I only had a few bites. The broccoli that came with was really salted and disgusting. The server was ok but could have cleared the table a little better; leaving glasses and plates in the way. Also, they put the extremely hot plate of food in front of my 1.5 year old without even a warning. First time eating here and we definitely won't be coming back :/"}
{"text":"Have seen many commercials for this place and was looking forward to trying it. Absolute disappointment! The waitress was unorganized and unaware of our complete dissatisfaction. Portion size was small for the price. I ordered the grilled salmon ceasar salad. The salmon was bland and the lettuce was wilted. I should have complained but the manager was to busy with other upset customers. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a Ruby Tuesdays before, but sadly this location did not meet my expectations. The restaurant as a whole was quite empty. The salad bar felt somewhat limited compared to other Ruby Tuesday locations I've dined at. The turkey avocado burger was overcooked, whilst the bun was stale, not toasted and cold. Oh dear. For the prices charged I had higher expectations arriving and left disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been there twice in the last three months. Food & service has always been very good. The salad bar is very good, as well as, the salmon I usually get."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Everything is always amazing the chicken is my favorite always juicy and amazing!"}
{"text":"It'd been years since I'd been to a Ruby Tuesday's before last month. And since then I've been three or four times. Is it that good? No, not really. I mean, it's not bad, not as bad you probably think it is, anyway. But it ain't great. So why do I keep going back? That's a good question. Because it's not cheap, either. Probably because it's close to work.  I've been making my way through their seafood options lately. The jumbo lump crab burger - it's crab cakes on a bun. That's probably some kind of no-no on somebody's lo-carb diet. Fried shrimp, grilled creole shrimp, shrimp scampi... tried 'em all, and they're all the same - not that good, but not bad. An incredibly solid three stars.  Oh, and they've got a veggie burger, which technically pushes them up to 3.5 stars, but I'm not in the rounding up kind of mood today."}
{"text":"Ruby Tuesday is one of those places that looks promising from the outside, but never manages to live up to expectations.  Let's split this review in half-  THE FOOD:  Had the triple prime burger with cheddar, and a side of fries. I've had a few burgers from Ruby Tuesday over the years, and they've been good; I'd say I've had more success with their burgers than any other entrees that I've tried. This burger was more of the same, pretty good. The bun is good quality, dense enough to hold up to the toppings, but not dense in the sense that it's hard or anything. The patty is well seasoned, and cooked to order. I got mine done medium, and it came out perfect for me, super juicy. I couldn't really tell much of a difference between this and their regular patties after all the toppings though, so if you're looking to shave a dollar or two off your tab you probably wouldn't miss it. All Ruby's burgers are served with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and Ruby's mayo. The pickles were awesome, crinkle cut dill chips, no complaints there. The lettuce and tomato were pretty sad on this particular burger, like they put the good stuff out on the salad bar and I got stuck with the scraps. I've had good produce on Ruby's burgers in the past though, so I'm willing to chalk it up as a one-off. The cheddar was good quality when I sampled a small piece of it on it's own, but it totally gets drowned out by the star of the show, which is the mayo. And when I say drowned, I mean literally, because they really slather it on there. It has a heavy dose of garlic, which I love, so no complaints there, but there was so much of it, the burger was slipping and sliding around in my hands like it was on ice. It tastes great, but you may want to ask for it on the side so you can control the distribution better. The fries were fine, nothing special but not bad, either.  THE SERVICE:  Let me start off by saying our waitress wasn't bad. I didn't catch her name, but she was attentive, made sure our drinks never got too low, and generally took care of us. That being said, there was a guy sitting in a booth caddy-corner to us, and practically every moment she wasn't attending to us, she was sitting in the booth with him just having a conversation. I'm not sure if it was her boyfriend, or just a regular or what. He must frequent the place, because a few of the other servers spoke to him in passing as well. And the restaurant wasn't jammed either, so she didn't have a ton of tables. Still, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a little off-putting. And the guy behind the bar was serving himself with something that looked like a mudslide. I'm thinking he might have actually been the GM, because he was going up to every table shortly after they were seated making sure than everything was good, and that seems to be a regular practice with the GM's at Ruby Tuesday. He wasn't drunk or anything; it could've been chocolate milk for all I know. Again though, it's just not a good look.  All in all, it seemed like everybody working there was content on doing the bare minimum just to get by. But if that's what I wanted, I could've just gone to Wendy's, y'know?"}
{"text":"My husband, son and I went for lunch yesterday.  The service was excellent! Very attentive, timely and helpful. The salad bar was great but the first plates we picked up were dirty.  I just put them aside and found a clean one.  Great selection on the salad bar.  The buffalo chicken sandwich and the mini turkey sliders we got were not so great.  You could eat them but prefer Red Robins.  Son got the petite sirloin and lobster tail and it was definitely petite!  Cooked to perfection! The lobster tail was excellent.  Mashed potatoes were very good.  The peach tea and the strawberry fizz drinks were excellent! And the refills kept coming.  Think if we go again it will be for dinner.  Tab was $68 for the three of us for lunch."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I saw the amazing $12.99 deal online and thought we would stop by and try it as I have never been to Ruby Tuesday before. As soon as we walked up to the door, we saw they had happy hour until 7PM so we decided to sit at the bar and enjoy a drink or two as well. The host was so welcoming when we came in and kept a smile on his face. The bartender was very nice as well and helped us almost right away. I decided to order the $12.99 deal with half a rack of ribs and my boyfriend ordered a burger. Food came out within 10-12 minutes, in the meanwhile I enjoyed a $3 margarita and he enjoyed a $2 beer. While sitting at the bar, you can see the kitchen. I noticed that the cook had a good 12 inch braid with no hairnet on which made me feel quite grossed out at all of the possibilities. Additionally, we were charged for full price beers even though we arrived and ordered around 6:18 per the receipt.   Food was good but it I ever come again it will be based solely on the fact that customer service was good and it is a better alternative to Applebee's."}
{"text":"So this is a chain, is a chain, is a chain. They delivered last week while I was on vacation. We went with my spouses parents, so 4 at the table. Ordered salads, while the 'rents ordered an appetizer, which was fried something like taquitos. The appetizer was deep fried to oblivion, while  the dipping sauce did nothing to rescue the little buggers.   Salad bar, which is kick-ass, gives this place 2 stars all by itself. Plenty fresh, plenty of choice. My usual is to pile the salad so high that by the time I am half way down the line, it's a circus act to keep everything loaded on already on the plate, and add more to the mound without having the whole mess tumble off the edges. This time I behaved, and made it back to the table with no spillage.   Main meal was a rib-eye steak. I must have rib-eye confused with filet mignon, because my steak was thin. And not very tasty. Baked potato and broccoli rounded out my meal. Both done OK.   Other meals gotten were satisfactory, as was the service. We got talked into a chocolate cheesecake dessert. One order with 4 forks. It was still too big. Ate too much.   So for now, this reviewer says skip the fried appetizers and the rib-eye. Two and two-thirds stars, rounded up to  three. Let me know how the rest of the menu parses out."}
{"text":"This Ruby Tuesday Was Really Gross The Bathrooms  Were nasty Smelled Like crap. I lost my appetite and ended up leaving with a turned my stomach. The staff was horrible we asked for a manager and they didn't even come to our table and see what went wrong.  Me and my husband didn't even want the salad bar it was so gross. We left right as the food came out and even that was cold. All across the bored I would never go back to that location again."}
{"text":"I'm having to downgrade Ruby Tuesday to 3 stars because of an experience I had there today.  I went in there for a mid-afternoon bite to eat.  The service was fast and friendly as always. The food was pretty good.  So what was the problem?  Well, my main complaint is that they stuck me in the middle of a very dirty part of the restaurant, with crumbs all over the floor and dishes piled everywhere.  One of the employees was cleaning, and cleaning...and cleaning. Spraying and vacuuming and stacking dishes.  It was very distracting and unappetizing.   I don't understand why they put me there when everyone else was seated in a cleaner area with open booths available.  Secondly, the prices have gone up.  I wanted to get salmon and the salad bar and it would have come to over twenty dollars with a drink.  (They are charging $3.49 extra for the salad bar rather than having it included in the entree.)  I think that's too much money for lunch at a chain restaurant.  My third complaint was that the music was way too loud.  I don't need to hear Billy Joel and the Byrds at top volume while I'm eating.  Actually, I wish businesses in general would stop tormenting us with \"classic rock.\"  I don't think I'll be back to Ruby Tuesday for quite awhile, if ever."}
{"text":"I used to love there salad bar.  It is awful now. Ordered salmon and asparagus the asparagus was mishandled and horrible.  Went a few months back.  We were seated.  The restaurant was pretty much empty when a waitress never came we asked if someone was coming they said they were busy and someone would be with us shortly.  We left."}
{"text":"This place definitely gave me the worst dining experience of my life. I am very surprised to see any good reviews for this place.   First I just want to say, this place has the worst atmosphere, it looks like a dark Ikea store. But I would not give a bad rating to a restaurant just for atmosphere.   The bad rating comes from an evening that started with a horrible waitress, I think her name was Shelly. From the moment we sat down she acted like we were a bother to her, and seeing as the restaurant was devoid of customers, you would think she would be friendly to her only source of tips.   Instead of asking what we wanted to order, she just stared at us until we spoke. I ordered the salad bar with my food, and when I walked over to it I wish I hadn't. Everything on it looked disgusting and wilted. My husband ordered the Triple Prime Cheddar Burger, which sounded great. And the first few bites indeed were pretty tasty, until he flipped the burger over and noticed MOLD on the bottom bun. We brought it to the attention of our waitress who simply said \"Eww\" and grabbed the plate and walked away. The manager then came over and offered another burger, but after that, we didn't want anything from the kitchen.   When the bill came, the manager took the burger off, but still charged him for his soda and a salad bar he never ate. I just feel like if you serve someone moldy food, you might just comp their drink as well.   We will never return to this terrible place, and most likely never to another Ruby Tuesday's either."}
{"text":"My husband was looking for beef. Since there were no other restaurants in the area, we figured we couldn't go too wrong with a chain. Not so. His ribeye had been marinated to complete chewiness.   My salad bar was delicious but my soup was inedible. Big hunks of uncooked broccoli in a cheese sauce that was far too salty to eat.   Service was pretty good but there were hardly any customers. I might try lunch there but not dinner"}
{"text":"Crab cakes were extremely bland and you only get two of them.  biscuits were late and mis formed salad bar is only reason to go here anymore where are the vegetarian options beyond the salad bar?"}
{"text":"Ruby Tuesday kicked it up a notch:) I was pleasantly surprised with my meal. I had the new Orleans style talapia with a Parmesan cream sauce with sauteed shrimp on top, and choice of two sides I chose cauliflower mash and grilled zucchini  . Great  meal for lo carb diet. The fish was broiled to perfection and the sauce made it better they even broiled the lemon a nice touch. Throw in unlimited salad bar for a few more bucks and I was stuffed and happy as I can be on a diet.:("}
{"text":"Prices have gone up with the menu changes. Portions vary each time. Honey mustard has changed for the worse. Tastes like vinegar. Dressings are like water, so your salad sits in it instead of it clinging to your fixings. Wait staff was nice enough."}
{"text":"I saw their commercial and looked at the menu online.  It looked decent enough.  Total meal was $50.00 for three people and the food was AWFUL. My daughter's burger was dry, my steak was oily and greasy and my wife's spaghetti squash had a nasty sauce.  My wife also had the salad bar and she said that was bad too.  The little muffins they serve you were the best part of the meal.  I eat out quite a bit and love places like Chipotle, Salt Cellar, Vincitorios, Flemmings and many others but this place is terrible.  I'm just hoping I don't get sick this evening.  You've been warned."}
{"text":"First time in a long time, and it'll be even longer before we go back. It took forever for our order to be taken, and then twice as long for the food. I kiddingly said to my husband that they had to go to WalMart Grocery (in the same parking lot) to get his Tilapia. When our food was finally brought to us, my husband's meal was hot. I ordered one of the appetizers for my meal - it was not even warm, and looked like it had been sitting since before they went to WalMart for the Tilapia. The restaurant looked like it needed a good cleaning and new management. Our server was okay, made no excuses for the delay in food being served. We waited over 45 minutes for our food to be delivered. I wish there was a positive I could post, but cannot think of one thing that made the visit enjoyable."}
{"text":"First off my waitress was from like mars or some wierd part of the world just beyond out of her element .. Paid 110 and I've never regretted spending money on dinner as much as I regretted this night.. I ordered a ribeye rare and what I got was a chunk of rogers ass from American dad!! Grey cold and super fatty so much in fact it felt Like it was pre chewed before they brought it out..next I'm not allowed the a1 bottle apparently and was limited to a 3 oz portion ramamquin..never going to waste money like that again!!"}
{"text":"Food was good . Service was excellent. Too pricey for what you get. The menu was nothing special. Not certain I will be back ."}
{"text":"Staff Was friendly but restaurant was very very cold.   No idea why they keep the temp at 65 F, I had to ask them to turn up the temp."}
{"text":"Talk about a bad smell as you walk in!  Gross!  It would be wise to add carpet powder or install air freshners if you arent going to change to carpet anytime soon.  Great food! But smell makes you gag.  Moved to the bar area."}
{"text":"With so many places to eat at Tempe Market Place, why would anyone choose Ruby Tuesdays? My visit was for a birthday get-together, definitely not my choice.   The run down:  The drink- Mojito, sugar water and mint. Thumbs down  The salad bar- constantly being replenished but nothing to set it apart from a garden salad. All of the toppings were what one would expect...except some pink meat, not sure if it was ham or cut up hotdogs (I didn't taste them).  The steak- petite sirloin, surprisingly seasoned well and cook medium as requested.  The mac and cheese side- had Parmesan cheese for sure. You could tell because, well, the smell of Parmesan ... Stinky feet smell. Despite the Cheesy overload, the sauce was gummy,gooey, gluey. Not sure how to describe it . Thumbs down on the mac and cheese.  Presentation- if you eat with your eyes, Ruby Tuesday has me on a diet. Zero plate appeal.  Service- prompt and polite.   Food was edible, but in no way memorable or worth going back to try again."}
{"text":"The customer service was really great!! The homemade hummus and roasted broccoli at the salad bar were to die for :))"}
{"text":"I had a Hickory Bourbon glazed pork chop. It was delicious!!!    The service was fantastic as well. Only thing - pork choices far fewer than chicken or steak. But other than that, no complaints"}
{"text":"Dishes were served quickly and presentation was excellent. I had the pasta which was Ok, but I like their ribs better. And of course the little biscuits are great, just need more of them."}
{"text":"I really don't like to be negative but this is the absolute worse Ruby Tuesdays that I've been too. It's not the servers fault, it's poor management of the restaurant as well as the kitchen. Granted we had a large party but when we arrived we were the only patrons and were for 15 minutes. It took 30 minutes just to get us drinks. It shouldn't take 1 hour and 45 minutes to get your food. We didn't even get all of our food orders out before we had to leave. Pathetic. The manager didn't even come out to explain the delays like any good manager would. When our party requested the manager he/she never came out. Again pathetic. If I could give less than 1 star I would."}
{"text":"Always dependable.  Ate crabs, artichoke dip, veggie mini zucchini cakes with unlimited salad bar. They have brown bread crumbs, which is rare and lovely."}
{"text":"Met a friend there for a drink but had the salad bar as well. Pretty fresh and tasted great.  There menu is pretty eclectic for a chain restaurant as well from salmon to steak.  Bathroom was clean which is a must to keep those regulars coming back. I'm definitely a fan."}
{"text":"Full disclosure:  I didn't have the salad bar. First mistake.  I ordered a m-r top sirloin, a plain baked potato and the seasonal asparagus. All three items were less than than mediocre. Steak was chewy and hard to cut. Might have been the knife, but it didn't look like a good cut and it wasn't. They did cook temperature, though. The potato looked old and brown, not mention small. Clearly they don't expect people to order plain. The asparagus was very thin. Cooked okay I guess, but not satisfying.  My server was very attentive.   Next time I'll either have the salad bar (hopefully, that is better) or just go to Outback."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant this particular establishment had super quick and friendly service. The restaurant was clean as were the restrooms. I had the turkey avocado burger with fries and a diet Coke. My boyfriend had a BLT and a Sam Adams Summer Ale. The waitress knew what beers were available when he asked what types of Sam Adams they had. Food was good for a quick dinner- clocking in at about 30 dollars. Their menu also offers lighter lower calorie fare and of course the well kept salad bar. No complaints- expectations were met!"}
{"text":"The salad bar was good, lots of variety. Pasta salads were yummy. The appetizer, 5 philly potstickers, was cold, then they reheated it in the microwave. Just bring me three fresh ones instead of nuked rubber wontons. This was the saddest part of the meal. The burger was requested MW, it was close to hockey puck status. At least the dog gets a treat tonight. The double stack chicken was okay, didn't resemble the menu picture but what item ever does? It was probably GMO. Then we got the check and the servers scrunchy clogged with hair; it fell unnoticed on to our table. I should've taken a picture it was the funniest part of the meal. Bottom line, If you go, get the salad bar because nothing out there was cooked in the kitchen."}
{"text":"I went with my son and girlfriend.  Evening service during the week.  Very friendly servers.  They seated us promptly and with casual conversation.  The shrimp fondue looked so good we ordered it.  Enjoyed the fondue, slightly runny but it was great on the chips and bread. As I ate a chip something hard was amongst the bite.  I pulled out a 3 inch long white piece of plastic that had melted on the chip.  They served rolls,  The rolls were amazing except there was only 3, on the plate and they were golf-ball size. We constantly had to ask for more.  It was as though they were small pieces of gold nuggets that they didn't want to share but were forced to.  Granted the waitress (sorry, did not hear her name) did it happily.   My son ordered the 12 ounce steak, which they ran out of and were willing to give him a free dessert if he ordered the 14 ounce steak.  I asked if he could have the 14 ounce for the price of the 12 ounce, but they couldn't do that.  I ordered the rib-eye.   They brought out our food in a timely fashion.  As I cut into my steak, the waitress came back to see how everything was.  As she stood there talking to us I saw a hair in my food.  She removed my plate to fix a new one.  The manager quickly came to our table and informed us that she would not charge us for the meal.  This is when I showed her the plastic that I had pulled from eating the chip.   My 2 guests finished their meals when I received mine.  I ate a little of it and it tasted wonderful.  We ended up having something unexpected come up and had to leave.  I placed my order for my daughter at home and my son placed his dessert order, to go.     I was surprised to see she only took my steak off the bill.  I was surprised due to the fact throughout the entire meal there were issues.  Not having what they should or letting us know they were out, plastic and hair in our food.  I understand you cant stop everything, and sometimes these sorts of things happen, but all at one time...embarrassing. I did give the restaurant 2 stars because beside the unwelcomed extras to our food, it actually had a very good flavor.  I truly enjoyed the food and the friendliness of the servers."}
{"text":"Gotta love coming here. (Since I was a kid) The service was excellent, Our Waitress, Debbie, was moving very quickly as it was busy inside but that never stopped her customer service as it was flawless. My girlfriend and I both went there for pasta, (Crispy chicken Mac and cheese, chicken and broccoli) Also tried the trio sampler (onion rings, crispy chicken bites, Italian five cheese skillet). Would definitely order it again, but less butter drowned in it. :)"}
{"text":"awful!!!! poor service, no excuse the place was almost empty..... i would suggest to close the doors on this place. took forever to get the food. money was wasted."}
{"text":"How does a restaurant that is featuring Asparagus on their menu at 6:00 pm on a Sunday not have any?  Oh and out of baked potatoes too, server was proud to tell us that they didn't microwave their food, how about putting them in the oven in time for dinner service. Was looking at the salad bar but for $9.00 extra, the items don't even come close to justifying that price. Would have paid more for better choices   Ordered the crab cakes/ Chicken entree with cheese grits.  Crab was passable, chicken was fatty and not trimmed prior to cooking and grits were so cold the cheese didn't even melt.   Ughh"}
{"text":"This is the second place I'd put on my list if I were making a veggie burger list a la Mark  D.  It's not the best veggie burger ever, but how fantastic is it that Ruby Tuesday has a decent veggie burger on their menu?  The one on the menu comes with garlic mayo and Swiss cheese, but that's all wrong.  I got it with barbecue sauce and American cheese (because that's WAY more Ruby Tuesday), and they were completely fine with the substitutions.  It was a decent burger.  It was gigantic."}
{"text":"Horrible over salted food. Broccoli-cheddar terrrible as well as kids mac and cheese. I am still thinking about it in my head and feeling nauseous"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Nice changes have been made to the brand since the last time I had been here.  More of a contemporary feel, and the menu items have changed (for the better) as well.  Relatively quiet place for a chain restaurant.  Try the mango ice tea, very good, with chunks of mango in it.  Great place for the family."}
{"text":"Ruby Tuesday's sent me an email telling me if I place an order online between 3 & 6 today that they will give me a free dessert. It states that just provide the one time code when I get to the restaurant to pick up my order. So I jump through their time, hoops. When I arrive to pick up the order they would not give me the dessert even after I showed them the code from my phone. So I wasted my time placing the order online & driving to pick it up. I left with nothing & will never step into another Ruby Tuesday as long as I live!  What happened to customer service?"}
{"text":"I love the salad bar and the variety of ice tea! I had pomengranate ice tea and my friend had mango ice tea.  This is a great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why so many people had bad reviews, but I was very happy with our visit. Of course the gimmick of RT is to have the salad bar, which I did get with my lunch. The salad bar was very fresh and the food was was cold. The restaurant and the restrooms were clean. Both of us had some special requests with our entrees which were accommodated by the kitchen. My sandwich and fries were warm and cooked well. Our server was friendly and attentive. I really have no complaints about the visit. It seems to be the same as most Ruby Tuesday's I've been to."}
{"text":"Do you want to be dehydrated because you didn't get waters? Do you want to eat cafeteria food where a side of processed grapes is $2.99 during happy hour which I like to call sad hour. Come to Ruby Tuesday, shouldn't even be considered a Ruby"}
{"text":"In gastonia you are either broke , retired, or right out the methadone clinic . I see why it's rated one of the 50 worse places to live in America . If you are not handing out free meals like the soup kitchen people are not happy . The ruby tuesday I must say is excellent . Nice attentive staff. Good energy . Hot food cooked correctly unfortunately most of the people that live in gastonia are inbreed. Just a bunch of old farts that bitch and moan about nothing . It's a shithole of a town I admit but I eat there 3 or 4 times a week and it's always top notch . Good quality food and great service . It's just a shithole town with a bunch of half ass people that chain smoke and everyone's broke as hell."}
{"text":"If I could give RT a zero I would.  Service was slow (waited over 15 minutes to place an order), the order took a long time to get there (we watched a party of 8+ people have their meals delivered and cleaned up by the time we got our food, so at least 30 minutes), the order was wrong (messed up the spices on my dish) and the food unappetizing (the squash side on my wife's dish was the best part of her's).  After the check was delivered and I had to sign the slip, the waiter was pretty much right on top of us the whole time.  I am not going to be pressured into giving a good tip when the service and food was horrible.  Not going back."}
{"text":"I went here with my mom yesterday for lunch. we haven't been here for a while because the service was so bad. thinking it might have gotten better we went in and were very disappointed. the atmosphere is clean and family friendly however our waiter forgot our drinks several times and was late with everything he did. he clearly didn't know what he was doing. my mom got a salad which had lettuce in it that was brown and not up to standards and I got a cup of Mac and cheese, literally... a cup. disappointed with our meals my mom complained and had her salad taken off the check. This place is not run right at all. Very unprofessional and service is poor. Come here if you like nasty food or restaurants running out of food in the middle of the day."}
{"text":"Last time I came here the service wasn't good at all but this time, Tina made it great! So friendly and personable! The food was great last time and this time it was just as good! We will definetly be back!"}
{"text":"The service and food is good and the prices aren't bad, sometimes I've spent more in the mall's food court. I really like the steak, they use a seasoning that is yummy. Great place to take the kids, they have some nice booths in the back if you have more than a couple little ones.  The mall has a nice carousal and typically if the kids are good we let them ride after dinner."}
{"text":"Steak & coconut shrimp were good. Ribs were to dry & green beans barely blanched. Beware the floor around salad bar & into restrooms is slippery. Service was good. Not very busy for a Sunday after church."}
{"text":"Customer service is lacking....food is getting subpar, music is to loud and when you use the restrooms the smell will make you puke"}
{"text":"aweful! i just left about an hour ago, and had to post this asap! The appetizer we ordered never arrived to the table! after about 45 minutes we asked the server and he said he didn't know why it hadnt been brought to the table, at which time we cancelled it and asked for the check for our drinks and salad bar. it took the server over 10 minutes to come back with the check; i stood up a couple of times and looked around and he was no where to be seen, not at the server station or bar. The dining room was not crowded at all, i'd say no more than 6 tables all together with no one in the bar area. On our way out, the manager asked if all was ok, I informed him of our service, at which point he preceeded to apologige and say that their system was down and he only had 2 servers on the floor and they had quite an influx of customers that came in. Once again , I looked around .....not very busy! I expressed to him how i also work in the service industry and how that was not busy and that in in fact their system was down our server should've said something rather then just have left us waiting. Much to be said for table maintenance as well. The manager asked us to please come back and give them another chance. As a manager, if the place is running short on staff and system is down, it's his job along with the servers to check on customers and make sure all transitions are smooth, not to mention to esure quality and guest satisfaction. This shoul've been rectified rather then a simple apology! I work vey hard to spend money on places that don't earn it, and i don't have that much free time to go out and have bad experiences! I would also think that this place, belonging to a corporation would be more aware of guidelines, and mystery shoppers hired or subcontracted by their corporation.  This is why bussinesses fail and people ask; why?  If you have no personnel that can do the job in all it's entireity, then hire a new crew and train them properly, including managers."}
{"text":"We ordered a full rack of ribs, zucchini, and Mac n cheese. Definitely not worth $25. The ribs were nasty. They give you 5 circles of zucchini, and the Mac n cheese has cheese that isn't melted and doesn't have much flavor. If you choose Mac n cheese as one of your sides, there is an extra cost.  These are the only items I've tasted from this place, so, I can't review any other menu items."}
{"text":"This place is great! The staff is wonderful and the food is great!! If you want a pleasant dining experience please go to ruby tuesday!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here so many times in the past 7 (almost 8) years and the food today just wasn't as good as usual. The service was a little better than usual though. Everyone at our table ordered a meal with chicken in it and it was all overcooked and just didn't taste right. The Chicken Parmesan Pasta was too cheesy (it has never been THAT cheesy) and didn't have enough pasta sauce. The chicken on the pasta was very hard and dry on the outside. Chicken tenders were also difficult for the kids to eat. I love this restaurant but I know I won't be going back for awhile."}
{"text":"Great salad bar and selection. To-die-for Garlic-cheese biscuits! Great baked potatoes and mixed vegetable platter. Grilled salmon was a little over-cooked but was graciously taken back and replaced and the second try was very good although only a 7 for flavor on a scale of 1-10. Our waitress, Tae, was a delight, an excellent server and very conscientious. This was an excellent meal and we'd recommend coming here. Nice atmosphere! It's right across the street from the Hampton Inn where we stayed."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Ruby Tuesday's in years, but my dad was raving about the soup and salad bar, so my husband and I made it a point to come have just that.  It is a pretty nice salad bar and it is only $1 more for a bowl of soup. Our total before tip was $24.82 for 2 soup and salad bars and 2 ice teas.  We will definitely be back. It was pretty good and a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and everything was perfect. Kyra was our waitress and she was amazing. Very sweet, friendly, knowledgeable. The service was very fast. We were in and out within an hour. The food tastes great. They made our first time here great. We will be back"}
{"text":"The worst experience I ever had in Ruby Tuesday's. DON'T EAT THERE! We came as a party of four and were seated by a friendly waiter. We placed our main entry orders and onion rings appetizer. When the appetizer came, we never got silverware or napkins. Our initial waters were never refilled again throughout the whole meal. My mom had to get up and ask the manager to bring us napkins, which he did, along with a sorry....The three meals came still with no silverware and no sides. We had to get up again and ask the manager for the silverware, which he brought along with a sorry AGAIN. It took the fourth person additional 10 MINUTES to get their meal. At that point, still no side items were brought for other 2 people. They finally got their salad and broccoli when they were almost finished with their food. The waiter could care less and so did the manager. The leadership comes from the top, and if the manager never came to check on us again and see if we needed anything after screwing up twice, what could we expect from the waiter. I will say that the quality of food was good. The employees of Ruby Tuesday's don't care about their customers, we are just a number there!!!!"}
{"text":"Love going and having Courtney wait on me and she always remembers you and what your drink is. She is always happy to see you, and the other waitress will gladly help her when she is busy with other tables. She will always help you find something on the menu if you cant decide."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible. My husband and I went for lunch on a Sunday. It was lunch time so we expected to wait. We were seated right away. It took the waitress 5 minutes to greet us and take our order. Then another 10 to get our drinks. She said she was going to bring us bread. We sat and waited. After 3 or 4 trips to the table where she was letting us know our food and refills would be out shortly we just sat and waited. I was getting a little annoyed when finally after sitting for 50 minutes without a drink, bread or our food we finally asked for the manager. She never came either. Once the hour mark hit we got up and asked the hostess to checkout for the drinks we had originally received. Will NOT go back or recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I received one of their coupon deals via mail. It was for 25% or 50% off the entire meal. I can't remember which. Anyhow, you get into the restaurant and find out that the deal is not for the whole menu, but rather certain sections of the menu. Of course they tell you this after you sit down and are ready to order the most delicious looking meal on the menu, only to find out you can't get a ridiculous discount on it. Should've read the fine print I suppose.   The service was ok at first. You never really know until after you've sat down at a restaurant such as this whether you have a competent waiter or not. It turned out our waitress was not a great one. We ordered our food, and it took quite a while for them to cook it. We got in there right about noon on Sunday, right ahead of the Church crowd. Yet it took them about 30 minutes to get the food out to us.  The food was very salty, and the waitress neglected to refill our water.  My family just didn't enjoy the experience. It's funny because I told my brother I was going to take my  parents out to eat at Ruby Tuesdays and he warned me against it saying the food's not that good. But I told him that the deal was good so might as well. If the food was bad and the waitress was good, I could consider going back and chancing it again. But since neither  was good, there's really no point in me going back there again. I would advise against this particular restaurant."}
{"text":"We went to the Ruby Tuesday in Gilbert on Market Street last night, and could not have been less impressed. And note, grading scale is against comperable chain establishments. Upon entering, we noted the general open atmosphere, like Denny's or Village Inn. I wasn't really hungry, so I just ordered a chicken quesadilla. It comes out and there is about a tablespoon of sour cream and some awful pico ish substance. It came in a basket with no plate, so i asked for a plate and some additional sour cream. A bit later a runner brought the sour cream in the smallest container i have ever seen. I am not sure it even held another tablespoon of sour cream, but whatever. The real issue was the taste of the quesadilla. I don't know if it was the chicken, the cheese or both, but it was awful. I am not that picky (we were eating at RT), but this was abysmal. I tried to cover the bad taste with the sour cream and pico, but that only seemed to make it worse. My wife did like her chicken and broccoli, but agreed that the new layout was very off-putting. Do yourself a favor, go anywhere but here..."}
{"text":"Absolutely Disgusting! Arrived at 12:30 pm for lunch today. Apparently the salad bar had been left uncovered since dinner last night. Lettuce was wilted and getting slimy. Tomatoes and cucumbers were frozen solid. Hummus and potato salad were covered with dry brown crusts. Half the other ingredients were almost used up. Staff made no effort to restock or clean up the salad bar.  With so many Ruby Tuesday's closing the staff must want to join the unemployed."}
{"text":"Shout out to Ruby Tuesday's for a very tasty burger and free wifi!  (I didn't know they had free wifi, did you?)  And, since I was there during the lull between lunch and dinner, they didn't bother me while I hung out and read my email for an hour after I finished eating."}
{"text":"The service was slow and food was not good,there was hair in the mustard...gag.although it was not crowded in here. The manager Evelyn will only apologize. Oh,did you know the wings come precooked year somehow made it to a table mate undercooked.The burgers were not done to our request and liking, they were dry. On top of that on our way out the door right now the greeter was facebooking,that's great,what's their phone policy for employees."}
{"text":"Service & food absolutely horrible. We waited over an hour for our food, they weren't busy at all. My daughter's spaghetti was cold, waiter offered to 'heat it up'. My lobster tails were raw, still slimey! Managers solution was that he would personally cook me some more. He did nothing to make the horrible service & food better. My steak was dry, broccoli was cold. Never in life will we go again. When leaving we asked for the corporates office number & of course none of the staff knew it, how ironic lol"}
{"text":"I had dinner at Ruby Tuesdays two days ago I ordered the petite sirloin with butterfly shrimp the steak was chewey like bubble gum I couldn't swallow it and the shrimp was fried too hard.The potato salad and the pasta salad was bland no flavor no seasoning just tasted like straight mayonnaise and the ham was soft and squishy didn't taste like quality ham more like turkey ham and no croutons.The manager was walking around and asked was everything okay and I didn't want to send my food back because I've heard awful stories about what they do to your food when you send it back.This is my third time visiting this Ruby Tuesdays and the other two times I was disappointed and thought maybe it just was an off day but I just think the food just isn't good anymore I don't eat out often and I think this will probably be the last time I choose to eat at Ruby Tuesdays.I use to eat there years ago and the food as well as the salad bar was excellent but not anymore. No stars !!!!!"}
{"text":"Last time I went it was bad customer service haven't returned"}
{"text":"Service was absolute 5 stars and the meal was absollutely wonderful.  I am so happy to have discovered Ruby Tuesday.  Oh btw the prices are excellent as well.  Just $9.99 for an entree.  plus salad bar comes free right now with their special.  cannot beat that."}
{"text":"Salad bar is out of this world!!!! Yummy drinks to choose from and decent choices for sides - love this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's where I always stop prior to going to the airport. Food is consistently great, service amazing, and the music they play is great! The salad bar is always fresh!"}
{"text":"The food isn't that good. I got a Caesar salad and it was mostly cheese with some lettuce. The hickory bourbon chicken was ok, but their menu is lacking. Their service is poor. I hardly saw our waitress on top of that and no one came by to check on us to see if our food was ok."}
{"text":"Just left the place very disappointed.  First off: the host seated us a table where other guests were already at We moved to another table and it took a long time for anyone to address us let alone get us a drink. We finally had a waitress (Morgan) come over  and help us. She was the only bright spot in an otherwise disapponting experience.  The salas was good as always but the rest of our meal was not good. We  probably will not be going back"}
{"text":"Food was very good, service was really good. Didn't catch our waiters name but he did a great job. Towards the end of our meal my husband ordered one more drink, the waiter order his drink then had an issue with another table he needed to handle. After a few mins he made it back to us to deliver our check, I noticed he charged us for the drink but didn't bring it, I let him know and just asked if he could grab the drink, not only did he get the forgotten drink he brought a second one on the house. I was also trying to get a coupon online while at the restaurant, was having problems getting into it and he helped right away. The only thing I can complain about is my kids like juice over soda but the juice is served in a very small glass and they do not have free refills, the waiter did let us know up front they weren't free. The juice was so small they finished it before our meal arrived."}
{"text":"My family and i decided to dine there yesterday after watching a movie and to celebrate my birthday. Our impression over all (and take note, all 4 of us) was not a good one. The food is salty but could be pass aside. Our waitress in a blue top makes the overall impression...she gave us the feelings that she could not wait to get rid of us...i ask what's their sides since i did not bring my eyeglasses, and she just said, it's in there and pointed to the menu. My husband tried to look for it while she kept on saying \"right there, right there\". I was annoyed already but still kept my cool, and said \"can you just tell me what is your sides? I didn't have my glasses.. and she told me in a tone that no one would want to hear. She then left our table, while i said \"what a nice customer service! She wants a nice tip, she need to give us a nice service! in a voice loud enough for her to hear. All of us was talking about her attitude. When a few customers arrived to the other tables, we were watching her, then \"Lo and Behold\"!, she was smiling at them, introduced herself, saying here name is \"Taylor\" and was very pleasant! what's worst is when she was gathering our plates, instead of asking us if we do want something else, like drinks or just make an up sale, because i was thinking of getting some drink, she didn't. Instead, she ask right away \"do you want the bill now?\". So my husband just said yes, then told me, don't let her ruin your birthday, maybe she's having a bad day, which i replied, but that does not justify her action...My husband still gave her $15 tip."}
{"text":"Had the worst experience in terms of service that we have ever had at a restaurant tonight. When we got there we first stood there for a little bit waiting on someone to even seat us. Then after we were seated it took at least 15 minutes before our waitress decided to stroll over and take our drink order. We had already looked at the menu so that sped things up. Now there was some people there but it wasn't overly crowded, we could have been sat immediately if someone was at the hostess stand. So our food comes and then our waitress disappeared. After a couple attempts to flag her down to no avail, I finally went up to the hostess stand and stood there for  minute or two (with other customers waiting to be seated) but no one ever showed up so I went and asked another waitress to please go get the manager for us. The manager finally came over and asked what the problem was and we told her about the lack of service and all we want is our drinks filled. Well she took our drinks and we didnt see her again for about 5 more minutes. Finally our waitress comes around the corner and I get her attention and ask her for more drinks. She then starts trying to explain the lack of service instead of just going to get our drinks. Finally both her and the manager show with drinks at about the same time. At this point we have had it and ask for the bill. She brings it over and we sit and wait. Finally we stand up and walk over the bar and flag the bartender down because she never bothered to come back to pick up our check  yet. They can't check us out and have to go hunt the waitress down and she was no where to be found again and they had to go get the manager to ring us out. We asked for the corporate number and the manager says it will be a minute and disappears into the back to not be seen again. I ask another employee and they say they think it is on the front of the building. Never once was anything done to try to remedy beyond just a \"sorry\". That store needs a crash course in good hospitality."}
{"text":"The food and salad bar are really good. The bar area is a good spot for a drink before or after a movie or to watch a football game."}
{"text":"Great biscuits and food! Just fantastic food! The service is good."}
{"text":"One of the worst meals I've had in a really long time. My wife and I had decided to try Ruby Tuesday's since we were looking for something different rather than the typical fast food restaurants there are around here. When we arrived the hostess sat us right behind the booth that the waiters use to ring up their orders, when there were plenty of other booths to choose from. We had to ask waitress if it was OK to move, which she obligingly moved us to another booth.   We then ordered our some strawberry lemonade's and they were absolutely disgusting. They tasted like pure concentrated crystal light with liquid sugar added in. We sent them back and got the wild berry iced tea, and they weren't any better but we didn't want to send them back again.   Our appetizers came in about 20 minutes later and they looked like they had been sitting under a hot lamp the entire time. I would understand if the restaurant was slammed with customers but there were only about 5 tables seated at the time. Our entrees followed about another 20 minutes later and the food looked disgusting. The ribs we ordered looked like they had been boiled and then just dabbed some BBQ sauce on top. The only thing that tasted good were the fries. The spaghetti squash tasted like old hash browns and I couldn't take it anymore.  We decided to order dessert to take the taste out of our mouths, so we decided to order the chocolate cake and tiramisu. You could tell they had just taken the cake out of the fridge, drizzled some chocolate sauce and powdered sugar on top and called it good. The tiramisu was even worse and tasted old.   All in all, we got stomach cramps from the food and wasted $58 dollars on a meal that should have been served with pepto bismol and a disclaimer.   Don't waste your time at this place."}
{"text":"Need more of these in the valley upgrade from chili's. I like their menu food is good. Great happy hour. Didn't care to much for crab cakes"}
{"text":"The food was awesome, the service great the dinning area was nice and neat, the only downfall was the restrooms they look like a 2 stars place, new fixtures are needed a total remodel and put more attention to detail. This will be a 5 stars review if weren't for the bathroom amenities."}
{"text":"I love the salad bar exceptionally good. Different from different restaurants I've been too."}
{"text":"I don't know what the fuss is all about. The burgers are not that good. The service was above average but the menu does not do it for me. I have no desire to come back. In and out burgers is just up the street. On a bad note: the men's restroom was so stinky, sewer problems I think. It ruined my appetite. Sorry Ms. Tuesday, any day of the week is not going to cut it for me. I am completely disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a wonderful meal at Ruby Tuesday's this evening. I had the bourbon salmon and my husband had the sirloin steak . Both excellent choices. We also enjoyed the plentiful salad bar . Our waitress Robin was extremely efficient and so very pleasant . I would recommend this restaurant anytime ."}
{"text":"It all started at seating. Why would you put 2 men that are over 6 feet tall at a tiny two person booth? The place was empty. We got up and moved to another table. Our server came out and immediately went through the beer selections I had to stop her midway to let her know water with lemon would be fine. She looked pissed, then asked if I wanted any appetizers or just wanted to get to the point. Really? That's how you treat your customer? I told her we just got seated less that 3 min. ago and needed to look at the menu. She walked away and we just said forget this place and walked out. Can I leave a zero star review ?"}
{"text":"We came here to have dinner the server it was slower than crap it took forever to get our drinks when I told him that we wanted to order when he came to get our drink order because it took him so long to get up to our table he just looked at me like I was stupid then I had an emergency to leave that I had to go take care of so I left it at the restaurant took care of what I need to take care of the manager who was absolutely awesome told the kitchen to hold my food for 10 minutes so that when I got back my food was hot when I got back my food was absolutely piping-hot the most awesome it could have been tasted great no complaints about my food service was the worst we will not be coming back to this store"}
{"text":"We were told the booths were all taken when clearly two were open but a waitress was sitting there on her knees, so had to ask specifically for it. Then, nobody waited on us and luckily Jessica L stopped by to save the day. They didn't have any ice to make our drinks so we had to wait for that... I loved my grilled chicken but they forgot the avocado that's supposed to be on it, my boyfriends onion rings weren't cooked all the way, my ruby relaxer had barely any alcohol in it, and we literally saw a waitress put a lemon in a drink with her hand after scratching her weave! Wow. Will never be back. If it wasn't for Jessica, I would've left."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and our last. The waitress was slow and forgetful. My husband said his food was tolerable but would have been better if we went to fast food. The salad bar was great and tasty. However, the broccoli cheese soup was disgusting.  It tasted like nacho cheese from 7-11 with broccoli florets dropped in."}
{"text":"Staff is always nice, food is really good and prices are fair. Their steaks are always perfectly cooked. And the appetizers they bring before the meal are really tasty.  If you wanna have a relaxing dinner id suggest you to stop here."}
{"text":"I don't know why I suggested Ruby Tuesday to my boyfriend. We we re in the area and wanted a quick bite. We were at this very restaurant about two years ago on N ew Years Eve and swore we would never go back. My thought was that our bad experience 2 years ago was because we were there on a holiday.  We were seated right away. The host was nice. It took a few minutes for the waitress to get to our table because she waited on someone else that was seated after us. They got their drinks and order placed before she came to our table  We got a couple sodas and appetizers. The server brougt over biscuits with the drinks. Wow, thet are tiny. The taste l8ke the cheddar bay biscuits from red l9bsrer, but slightly sweeter. The quesadilla and Thai spring rolls. The quesadilla was pretty good, it came with Pico de Gallo and sour cream. Not the best I've ever had, but not the worst. The spring rolls were just some take out of the freezer and dunk in hot oil type food. They came with a spicy dipping sauce which was a good thing since there is no way they stand on there own in the flavor or texture department.  The insides had the consistency of ground up rubber cement according to my boyfriend. Our bill, including the tip was $27.  We won't be back here. I promised my boyfriend he would never here the words Ruby Tuesday from my mouth again.  Oh, and we walked by the salad bar as we left and it was an absolute mess. I don't know how or why since the restaurant wasn't even a third full.  It seems like they just don't care."}
{"text":"We had dinner there about 3 PM. The service was pretty good.my wife had Bourbon Street chicken with the salad bar and broccoli. Which was very good. I Had Bourbon St., Porkchop with the big potato and greens. We also had complementary biscuits they were also very good so we asked for more and they brought those free also. All in all an enjoyable eating experience."}
{"text":"Manager wiped down table with extremely wet rag.  Waitress watched while we unfolded the napkin from the silverware and dried off the table.  She did bring us extra napkins to replace those we used to dry the table.  We did complain, and saw her tell the manager, but manager never apologized.  Food was mediocre.  Manager studiously avoided eye contact as we left.  Please note we were pleasant to the waitress and left a lower than average tip, and will not be returning."}
{"text":"First time here with my family, and everything was absolutely amazing. The food was so delicious. No waiting, and nice employees."}
{"text":"Quite the awful experience here! Went to lunch with some friends and our kids, we got sat right away but waited quite sometime to be greeted by our server finally about twenty minutes later we got our drinks! Food was okay definitely nothing to write home about. But because of the service I am definitely turned off from going to any ruby Tuesday again!!!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I've been to a Ruby Tuesday, so I was a little excited to try it out.  The host was nice and sat me and my husband quickly in a booth. It took what felt like forever for our waitress to wait on us. She finally came and took our drink order and appetizer order.. it took forever for her to bring our drinks and take our food order. When we got our appetizer it was pretty good we got the spinach artichoke dip and chips, problem is we ended up drinking all our drinks and it took her 15 minutes to refill our drinks. My husband had Sprite, it tasted awful!!! She kept bringing him more Sprites that taste gross... he then opted for water, the waitress did take off the Sprite off our order, so that was nice. The food was good, but the restaurant was FREEZING!!!!!!! I was not happy at all about feeling like I was sitting in an igloo. Our waitress kinda seemed like she wasn't on top of things, I could hear her go from each of her tables and apologize about something she did wrong. I guess everyone has off days.... I don't think I'll go back to that location again though.. there are much better restaurants to choose from."}
{"text":"I have been going to Ruby Tuesday's for years. My favorite thing was the salad bar. I just spent $9 for a container that is half the size as usual. Time to change restaurants"}
{"text":"Go anywhere else. Dirty. Seats are worn. Booth we sat in is sticky. Seat in the corner booth was ripped. Very worn down. Our waiter was good. That was the highlight."}
{"text":"My wife and I and family on both sides have been dining at RT for many years and it at one time it was in the top 4 or 5 spots to go to because of food quality, choices, salad bar and price. Since my wife and I eat out a lot we dined at RT often over the years and over the many years we have noticed a slow and steady decline in the overall quality of the RT experience. It always puzzles me when items that are popular are taken off the menu with out any corresponding alternative so when my wife looked for her favorite item and found it was no longer available it confirmed our suspicions. We immediately noticed that the latest advertising of a \"new salad bar\" was only a ploy. There were no remarkable new items on the bar and to our disappointment some simple item had been eliminated. We both ordered burgers and again suspicions further confirmed, they were they size of happy meal burgers. Although the patty was only slightly thicker then McDs, they were dry and relatively tasteless. So our suspicion is that RT is going the way of Dennys (anyone remember when Dennys had bars). Will we ever return to RT? Well maybe if our senior aged parents insist and buy, maybe we will go back. On our own, probably not. Its really to bad because we really did enjoy RT at one time, a long time ago."}
{"text":"Thank you!  We had dinner tonight with my aunt (94) and mother (89).  From the entrance, everyone was accommodating and friendly.  Great service and support to make it a pleasant and enjoyable evening.  Good meals only surpassed by the service."}
{"text":"This Ruby Tuesday's is actually closed permanently. I don't know when it closed but it is now closed."}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly,  and didn't complain about having to separate all of our checks.   They were flexible with  switching out items on the sampler plate.   My steak was cooked as I asked,  and was fairly good for this type of restaurant.   The green beans were nice and crisp and surprising seasoned very nicely.   The mashed potatoes however were like paste."}
{"text":"This place isn't a that great.  Sure, they have a beer special after 9 p.m. but no one goes here for drinks.  They're burgers are terrible.  The drinks are okay, but considering the price, they aren't that good.  I hear the salads are good since I never tried them myself.  The service is mediocre and the restaurant is just average.  I would advice just going to Chili's across the street."}
{"text":"We were there, apparently, at the exact time as Nicole W, last night, but had a different experience.  We, too ordered the mini's, fries and endless salad special for $9.99.  Great deal!  We found the salad bar to be full of fresh selections and delicious dressings.  I found my salad creation to be perfect, and said so at the time.  It was absolutely delicious.  And then, the mini's and fries came out hot and almost too fast!  They were good, as well.  The waitress was attentive, friendly and I saw the manager speaking with a patron about choices of how his steak would be cooked to be sure he understood how he wanted it.  After it came, I saw the waitress asking him if it was cooked to the correct degree for him. It was.  The atmosphere was relaxing, salad was delicious, but I'll agree with one thing, Nicole.  We weren't verbally offered dessert, but there was a rather large dessert menu placed, standing up, conspicuously, on the open end of our table.  Might, also have been due to the fact that we were pleasantly stuffed after the meal and had said so on more than one of the last few times the waitress checked on us to see if we needed anything.  We enjoyed the whole experience and WILL be driving out of our way to visit this location again. :-) Latoya was our waitress."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night (a Wednesday) with a friend, my first time. Firstly, the service was excellent. I arrived 20 minutes before my friend so killed time at the bar, where the staff was incredibly friendly. The bartender offered me complimentary bread as I waited - even though I was only sipping a water until my friend arrived.  Those little breads are amazingly delicious, incredibly flavorful, flaky and moist - they almost stole the show from my dinner.  The interior is very nice. We ended up sitting in a generously-sized but very nice booth. (I'm a big girl so worry about sitting in booths that may be too small to accomodate me, but no problems here). The table and combination booth/chair seating looked great and very comfortable.   My dinner was very, very good. The salmon was crispy and very well seasoned on the outside, and flaky/juicy on the inside. I really would go so far as to say that it was the best-tasting restaurant salmon I've had. The shrimp skewer had a very smoky flavor, just divine. My side was the tomatos covered in balsamic dressing, which tasted as expected, nothing great but not bad at all.  The broccoli/cheese soup had one minor flaw, it was a little too salty for my taste. However, when I bit into the large, obviously fresh and still crunchy pieces of broccoli, that more than made up for the saltiness.  Unfortunately, we lingered a little too long so did not have time for dessert.  I am most definitely going to go back with family members to introduce them to this restaurant. I understand from other comments that this is a chain, but honestly, it was a great experience so that did not matter at all."}
{"text":"So I was in Phoenix for my brother's wedding. Stopped by this place for late night food and drinks because it was close to the hotel. The server was very friendly. And stopped by just enough times to see how we were doing. Drinks were pretty good pours. Course I ordered a long Island so it's pretty much all alcohol anyway. The chicken sandwich was great as well.   The Ruby Tuesday in Sacramento where I live closed a couple years ago, which is lame. I've always thought this place is like a better version of Applebees. I'm never in Phoenix so I'll probably never come here again, but figured they deserved a shout out."}
{"text":"I went to Ruby Tuesday for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  THe food was very good.  THey have great burgers there.  However, I witnessed a server using the restroom (#2), and he got up and left without washing his hands.  THat was it.  I just paid and left.  I don't know if this is common practice at this restaurant, but it does bring up big concerns regarding cleanliness."}
{"text":"Came in with my family for a nice afternoon lunch a few weeks ago and we were appalled to see a woman with her small terrier dog at the salad bar! I understand people have assisted/service animal needs however this animal is to remain at the guest seat, under the table not right up on the salad bar where other guest eat from! We spoke to the manager about this and she just made excuses about how she was unaware and she would have to check the handbook about service animal rules! At that point we were just disgusted and left! I'd rather not eat at a restaurant where the management has no idea of the rules and regulations of public safety and quality assurance! Never going back!"}
{"text":"The best crab cakes I ever had.   Great service.  I have been here many times.   Also super prices."}
{"text":"Always Love Ruby Tuesdays but this location was the worst experience in my life. To start with the cups the water was served in were filthy when asked for new cups those cups were filthy, also the manager informed us the filter was dirty the water was coming from. The salad bar was filthy with eggs and  cheese   inside of the salad dressings they were substituting bologna for the ham. And then it got worse the meal came 45 minutes later with completely raw bacon served on top of the chicken sandwich. It was obviously a filthy badly managed establishment. Our waitress however was a sweetheart."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very clean. We were seated at a booth in a nice place but the food was not what I had expected the shrimp cheese fondue was good but kind of thick for fondue. Our waitress was very nice and kept our water filled.  We each got the salad bar and it was very fresh and had a good assortment.  More of a diner atmosphere than a special night out."}
{"text":"Visited on Friday 6.1.18 and it was our first time at this location. They have a good menu selection and the atmosphere is nice.   Food: *3 stars* Ordered the hickory bourbon chicken with asparagus and macaroni. The cheese in the macaroni was not melted. It is considered a premium side and costs extra and it was nasty. The chicken is a very small piece, though, it was good. The asparagus was cooked well. My date ordered the shrimp pasta and was disappointed that it came with few shrimp. We bother ordered drinks. The spiked strawberry lemonade was great and was only five bucks. The top shelf margarita was good as well.   The waitress was very nice and offered to switch my macaroni out when she noticed I hadn't eaten it but I was okay with leaving it, just won't order it again. I'll be back to give the place another try."}
{"text":"Normally good food and service, however how don't you know what freshly cooked fries are. They gave me and my wife old fries. The fries were lukewarm and stale. When we sent them back the brought back the same fries and said they just came out. I never had dry warm fries out the grease. Then the rookie waitress apologized and said \" I'm sorry you didn't like the fries\" like my taste buds were wrong for wanting hot fries. If I'm waiting 20 minutes for a burger and fries I expect them to be fresh. The salad bar was on point, I saw the attendant refill and keep it up consistently. Yet the lack of common sense from waitress was astounding. I hate wasting my money on lack luster service and food.  Extremely inconsistent!!!I will never go to this Location again. I will try Another location.   Ps not independence location, they served me water with soap and a piece of a sports sponge in my glass"}
{"text":"44th Anniversary at the Gilbert RT was a disaster! One and a half hour wait to get a table so we sat at the bar. Obviously understaffed, people were being told to wait and hour plus when we saw 5-7 empty tables the entire 2 hours we were there.  The food was pretty good when it finally showed up 65 minutes after ordering.  The bright spot of the evening were the Rock Star performances by Patrick and Stephanie behind the bar! Without their hustling efforts and positive attitudes this Ruby Tuesday might just as well close its doors."}
{"text":"Courteous staff and clean restaurant. We were seated at a center round table and frankly the plastic table cloths are a huge turn off.  The menu had a great selection of your typical American Fare restaurant. Sliders, burgers, ribs, and steaks. Prices are reasonable, average about $10 -$15 per person.    For appetizer we shared fried green beans that came in a light crispy batter. Sadly the green beans were really soggy, and that was a turn off. For lunch I ordered the chicken tacos with the tortilla soup. I have to say if I could do this over again, I'd order a bowl of that soup! So hard to describe - just a bowl of flavor, so Very tasty!! The tacos were also a melody of flavors and textures. Peppered chicken, grilled peppers, mushrooms, crispy lettuce pico de gallo and a light drizzle of crumbled feta cheese in a soft flour tortilla. I would have rather have paired Cotija cheese with this but the feta was close enough. The sweetness of the peppers and the salty cheese was an excellent idea! Loved them."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant I was impressed today. First, we were greeted immediately as we entered the door and two waiters held the door open for us. Second the waiters were so helpful accommodating our party of 12.  We ordered appetizers and the arrived fast. They took our orders and all 12 orders came out at the same time and everything was nice and hot.  I had the salad bar with  the veggie trio and it was excellent.. The others in my party were very happy with their selections and the friendly and attentive staff. The only negative thing I have to say is that some of the  tables and chairs are out dated. Four of our chairs were wabbly and we had to ask for waiter to change them since we were afraid they would break."}
{"text":"My Vegan options on spot! Spaghetti squash, grilled asparagus, baked potato and brown rice. Also a fresh mixed greens salad with fresh carrots, broccoli and onions and peppers.  Another vegan option when going out with the family. Our server, Andrew was great. Very attentive and nice."}
{"text":"Horrible! Crab cakes were the size of silver dollar pancakes and not cooked through, a barely tepid bowl of soup and a shrimp/pasta dish that was inedible. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars if for the outstanding young lady that waited on our table. Lexie was wonderful! Sadly, even her great service and sparkling personality aren't enough to ever bring us back here."}
{"text":"Very disappointed,  no biscuits,  dirty salad bar, no fruit on salad bar, margaritas in a regular 8 oz glass,  SUCKS"}
{"text":"No Pepper jack cheese but the food and services was great. Server was very attentive. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"holy yuck.  this place used to be passable, but it's not anymore.  i decided to venture there with a meat eating friend today for an early dinner.  i usually concede to eating here when i have mixed company (i mean, vegetarian and not) - because there is a salad bar and i can usually throw together something eatable.  tonight.... not the case.  the server was super nice.  she was prompt and friendly and i never had  to wait to get beverages refilled..... which was great because the sodium content of our food had to be through the roof.  i probably drank 4 glasses while i was there.  crazy.  the \"salad\" bar?  grossness.  i took some spinach.... and really.... that was about it.  why?  the server who was replenishing the salad bar was not taking the old food off the bar before putting the new stuff in.  i watched as he added food to the top of every plate on the salad bar.  it wouldn't be a big deal if i hadn't already seen what he was throwing perfectly fresh food ON TOP OF.  the cucumber bowl was full of frozen, slimy cucumbers.  the mushrooms on the bottom of the bowl were the same way.  he comes the fresh food.... right on top.  blech.     i also noticed that there were not many vegetables on the salad bar either.  mostly meat, prepared salads, some tomato, and a couple other vegetables.  when i returned to my table, i asked the server if she could maybe bring some cucumbers or carrots or something -- because their salad bar was conspicuously absent of....vegetables.  she said she thought there were those things on the salad bar.  i explained the cucumber thing, and said there were no carrots.  she said she would go and find out.  she returned a few moments later and explained that their \"manufacturer\" had not sent carrots because of the \"drought\".  seriously?  anyway.  it was a disappointing trip.  i was offered a baked potato for the hassle, but it wasn't what i wanted.  i had wanted a big salad.  you know.... like a regular salad... only bigger.... with lots of stuff in it.  ***************  edited 12 hours later to say:  i spent the night throwing up after this visit.  not shocking really."}
{"text":"Came in today for a burger.  Chose the smokehouse burger. It was very good, hot and juicy with plenty of sauce. Washed it down with a few beers at the bar. Also had the salad bar...definitely get the salad bar. It was only $3 more and it is all you can eat too.."}
{"text":"Zero management, salad bar was mediocre, served drinks in dirty glasses. Heard fowl language from the runner of the salad bar."}
{"text":"It was my first time ever in a Ruby's, and unless someone twists my arm to get me back, it'll probably be my last.  Nothing was terrible, but was very pedestrian, and I was underwhelmed by the menu and the service.  Told the server it was my first time, and asked what's good, but she wasn't very helpful, giving no suggestions, and responding when I asked if the burgers are good saying you get bored of the same stuff if you work somewhere.  Thanks   The salad bar was the lone standout that made it worthwhile, while the prime burger didn't deliver on it's promise of being the best ever, not by a long shot.  Was out with my parents who got the lobster tail and steak combo.  They said it tasted alright, but the temps on both steaks were way off.  My medium burger was way more red than the rare filet, and the med rare had no pink yet alone red, but at least it was a good enough deal with the tail, even though it was small.  The onion rings are actually straws, which I normally loves, but they were extremely greasy, and either burnt or the fryer oil hasn't been cleaned since they opened."}
{"text":"I like Ruby Tuesdays for one specific reason - the salad bar. It's not huge, it's not fancy, it's not even the best one I've ever been to, but it's consistent and it's fresh.   So when we moved to Streetsboro, we needed somewhere to go our first night here. We decided to treat the sister that helped us move in and braved the sub-zero temps. Maybe it's because I had been on the road from Florida for two days eating cracker barrel, subway and truck stop food, but the meal was delicious. The salad bar even more so.  We went back a few weeks later and again, the salad bar - good. Consistent. Fresh.  The only complaint I had the second time was that when my steak came out, it was gray and lifeless. It tasted fine, but alone on the plate with no garnish or trimmings, it looked dead and despondent. Not really appetizing, but still good to eat once I doctored it up with some color and plopped the baked potato on the plate with it.   Overall, it's a chain. You know what you're getting and you get it. Since there's no Chili's around here, we'll use it as our, \"Where do you want to go? I can't decide. Ok, let's do Ruby Tuesdays again.\" restaurant."}
{"text":"My parents ate here today and we're very disappointed. First off my mom ordered a coke and was brought a non carbonated coke water. They flagged down the waiter and told him it was flat. He then told them that the carbonation machine was not working properly. Why would they not say that before serving it?? The manager then came over and repeated the same info. My dad asked why they would even be serving it and charging people 2.50$ for a flat gross soda. The manager just walked off. Plates were also dirty on the salad bar. As they left they asked the host for the managers first and last name.. They replied that they didn't know the last name as they glanced near the front door where the general managers name was printed. My dad saw it and was like oh you don't know their name but it's right in front of you. How rude. Won't be going back here. \" good bye ruby Tuesday\" -The Beatles"}
{"text":"I had not been to a Ruby Tuesday's in quite a few years. They keep putting out coupons so finally we went.                                                           We went to the one in Tempe Market place, which is very nice.                  They decorated very high end i must say. The menu was impressive! I got Salmon and my date got Broccoli and chicken pasta. Both Items were great!   Everything was very fresh.                                                             I was drinking green tea and she refilled it for me several times.                 We can never seem to leave a restaurant even after we are through eating. So they were very good about that and we really enjoyed the meal and the ambiance of the place.  The location is great. Lots of parking and you can walk around in the marketplace with lots to look at afterward."}
{"text":"Great salad bar, free garlic cheese biscuits and fantastic, pleasant service!  The Cajun ribeye is out of sight!!  I will definitely be back.  I love the pictures hanging around on the walls as well."}
{"text":"I came to Ruby's , never been to one. I decided to take my wife for her B-day. We went for the main thing ...Steak ... ok back in track, very nice , clean, atmosphere very quite and nice waiters and attentive. Love the service. So back to the dish , the Stake wa superb I don't know who was that cook that day but it was so tender melted in my mouth.. the vegetables hit the spot , not too soggy nor raw just perfect...oh and the Nash Taters love it as well.  I recomend it , I enjoyed it..."}
{"text":"The cost is a little high but you can google for coupons and get half off second meal. It was tasty and good. We enjoyed our meals."}
{"text":"Awesome experience here! This is the first time we've been to this particular Ruby Tuesday and it was fantastic! The greeter at the door was so friendly and he was very funny as well! The service was quick and fast, and the manager, Kevin (I believe it was, he said he was new) came up to our table to make sure we were doing well. Overall, a great experience. Don't skip out on dessert, either! It was fantastic!"}
{"text":"We visited Ruby Tuesday on Friday November 27 with my fiancé and his family that was visiting from out of town. We got there about 10Pm, the restaurant was absolutely dead.  We all ordered our dinners, and it took quite a while for the food to come out, even considering we were the only table in the whole restaurant.  My fiancé's mother ordered the full rack of baby back ribs that the waitress highly recommended and said they were the best ribs.  They came out with hardly any meat on them and they did not look like baby back. My fiancé ordered the Asiago steak with shrimp, and requested the steak be cooked medium well to well. When his steak came out it was Medium Rare!  The waitress did back him up and say that it did not have the right cook on it, my fiancé did request to her if it could come back out without the asiago sauce on it, as it was slathered in it. We heard her tell the kitchen that it was not cooked correctly when she took it back.  About 10-15 minutes later the manager came back with a steak, we assumed it was a fresh steak, and  said \"I had the steak brought  up to proper temperature\" We did question if it was a new steak and he seemed shocked when we asked that and said \"No\".  My fiancé cut into the steak, which already had several cuts in from when it came out the first time, it was WAY over cooked and tough, and it looked like the sauce was rinsed off the steak, because there was no sign of the cheese sauce at all. The manager came back over, and came across very annoyed and patronizing to us. My fiancé decided to just get a burger, which did come out much better.  They were also running a promotion that if you purchased a $50.00 gift card you would receive a $15.00 bonus card to be used in January. We took advantage of that while we were waiting for the meals to come out.  At the end of the dinner, we wanted to use the $50.00 gift card that we just purchased to pay for our meal, then manager then came back over and said that \"we were not allowed to do that, because the card was not activated and if everyone came in to do that Ruby Tuesday's would just be giving away $15.00 coupons, and the gift card had to be used on another day.\" Any other restaurant that offers bonus cards with a gift card purchase, allows the customer to use the actual gift card on the same day it was purchased, since the bonus card is to get you back into the restaurant on another visit.  We told him that the money that we had to originally pay for the bill, we used to purchase the gift card,  then again in a very patronizing tone said that he would pay for the bill out of his own pocket and cash out the gift card the next day.  Nowhere on any of the promotion advertising, does it state that the gift card cannot be used on the same day of purchase."}
{"text":"What happened to Ruby Tuesday at Great Northern Mall Ohio? We have gone there several times before and had great food.  We went for dinner Sat. June 30, 2018 and had a terrible dinner. First of all the waitress, maybe new, didn't know the oz. sizes of the draft beer.  We ordered our meals: 1-6 oz. top sirloin and 1-salmon dinner. They did not have any rolls or bread at all.  OK, I asked for baked sweet potato, not on the menu, they did not have any. I asked for mashed potatoes and gravy, no gravy.  No side order of cooked mushrooms. We did each, take the garden bar as a side. It was like 6:30PM and they were not re-stocking the salad bar.  I ordered the top sirloin as medium, I got it well done.  So, my dinner plate had a scoop of mashed potatoes and a 6oz. top sirloin.  And the other dinner had a scoop of mashed potatoes and the baked salmon. Very naked looking plates and not appetizing looking. I should have taken a picture of it.  The baked salmon had no tartar sauce or anything on it.  No taste to the sirloin.  The place had a nice amount of people.  We never experienced this before at this Ruby Tuesday."}
{"text":"The ice water was pretty cold. So was the steak. Ruby Tuesdays is a Christmas classic. I'm taking some baked ravioli to go. I'll let you know how they were :)"}
{"text":"Just disgusting. Will not tolerate this Anti-American business any longer.  Veterans eat too!"}
{"text":"I have not been into big chain restaurants since the nineties when they made their appearance and took over the minds of Americans as the places to eat. I am very picky on chains and Ruby Tuesday's is not a chain I would pick.  Then why come to the only remaining Ruby Tuesday's in Las Vegas? It was purely to spend time with a friend who likes chains and I will not hold that against her. My friend remembered when we arrived my avoidance of big chains and said \"I forgot. You are not into big chain restaurants.\" Great, thanks friend! It was ok, I was there for the company.  I ordered the Coastal Mojito for my starting cocktail. I think the word cocktail is stretching it a bit as well as the word, mojito. For a time, the mojito was my go to drink. Ruby Tuesday's version of a mojito was more of a \"Get Out\" than a \"Go To\". It was very sweet and did not have the same qualities as your normal mojito. NEXT!  My friend and I decided on the salad bar, that seemed safe enough. The salad bar was mediocre at best. It was just your average run of the mill, low cost produce setup in a bar. I just chose what seemed appetizing and threw on dressing. I did take it up a notch and pay extra for the add-ons of the salmon and chicken. It costs more but it did add a bit of normalcy to my lunch. Both the salmon and chicken were ok, it tasted like salmon and chicken. No real bragging rights. NEXT!  I still kept trying and ordered the Cheese and Broccoli soup. NEXT!  That is all I can say about the last remaining Ruby Tuesday's in Las Vegas. It just confirms why I am not into many big chain restaurants that focusses on the price rather than the quality. There is a market for these big chains though. To each their own."}
{"text":"After diving, a group of about 10 of us stopped here for lunch.  I had the buffalo chicken snackers/sliders, which came with the salad bar, which was fresh and had some variety; however, not worth $9 on it's own. Someone had a bowl of soup, which consisted of about 4 spoonfuls, fries were cold, and portions were random (size wise), depending on what you ordered.  Waiter was nice, but never really checked back in, once we had our food.  Likely won't be going back. \"Meh\" just about covers it."}
{"text":"I wish I had gone with my original feeling and hit Native. This restaurant had SLOW service, the food was sub par, and for what I paid, a rip off. Skip this place. BAD experience!!!!!"}
{"text":"So I stopped in today with my mom for a late lunch after shopping all day. First off we stood in the lobby for about 5 min with not one person around. A women came in the door behind us and said let me get the hosts for you. She came right back and said \"well I guess we don't have a hostess right now. I think she actually got fired\". Ummmm good to know! Next we were seated and as we walked by the salad bar we could tell it hadn't been cleaned up or refreshed from the lunch rush and it was 3pm already. It was very messy and dirty looking. We looked around more as we sat and my mom- being a clean freak- looked up at the divider wall we were sitting next to and was grossed out by the amount of dust on it. While I agreed it needed to be cleaned as well, it didn't both me as much. We order drinks and my mom just could not get over how dirty the restaurant was. Then the drinks came...oh lord this sealed the deal. The glasses were FILTHY! They seriously looked like a 2 year old had just ate a meal using this glass and then it was immediately served to us. Gross! We yelled across the room to the waitress that was standing there talking to other employees that we changed our mind and we got up and left. We don't live in the area so there's no need for us to return, but if you want other customers to dine with you, you better starting cleaning!"}
{"text":"We wanted a couple of good burgers. Ruby's always sending email offers. OK I'll try it. Well here we go, Looked at the menu on line picked 2- Triple Prime bacon cheddar, burgers comes with lettuce, tomato, pickles and ruby's mayo. $ 11.99 each . Oh yeah comes with onion rings or fries. So I called the  ordered in  waitress was pleasant. Picked up order paid $ 24.00 + tax and tip. Got home WOW was I surprised the meat was dry I'm talking drrry, probably precooked no mayo and four onion rings .And let me add the time from ordering to pick up and back home less than 15 minutes. I might expect this from some other fast food but here absolutely not. After talking to other friends at work about this . Surprisingly this is the norm for this Ruby Tuesday.They suggested to try a different location. I think I will just stick to Varsity BBQ  in Kannapolis, 1/2 lb Burger with Swiss & Cheddar, Lettuce, Tomato, Grilled onions, Pickles, Mayo & mustard on 5\" bun with fries for $ 6.75 or Christos in Concord They have great Burgers also just can't remember the price. Sorry Ruby's was really anticipating a delicious Burger. THE FOOD DUDE"}
{"text":"From a 7/30/14 stop on the book tour - Really surprisingly good salad bar. We were very happy to find a solid salad bar in a Ruby Tuesdays. It really was above and beyond what we expected. Great staff there too, but all the veggies were fresh and the options were great."}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I are leaving today to go visit family, so we've been steadily working our way through all of the edible perishables in our house. Last night, tired of eating things like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and slightly-slimy salads, but out of viable leftovers, we debate about dinner. A sudden inspiration: Hey! We have a Ruby Tuesday 2-for-$20 coupon! Genius! I would never pay full-price for the entrees we got at Ruby Tuesday. (Lobster carbonara (orig $16.99) and chicken & broccoli pasta (orig. $14.99?), for the record.) The food is good, but with prices on entrees that rival some of the more high-scale dining in the area, it's overpriced. Charging 2.40 each for soft drinks is also a little on the pricey side.. come on, it's iced tea. But with the coupon, the check was just under $27, which is not bad at all for dinner for two. Plus, I really dig the cheesy cheddar biscuits they serve when you sit down, even though it's a blatant Red Lobster ripoff. (Who cares, still delicious.)  Our service was pretty fantastic. We were seated right away despite the full parking lot, and helped out within a couple minutes of sitting down. Just enough time to make a decision! Also, our $2.40 soft drinks were refilled promptly and without asking. I love that. All in all, I'm happy with the Ruby Tuesday here in town, and for a chain restaurant, I think it makes for a nice dinner. But my recommendation is certainly to watch your mailbox for the coupons they send every month - it can save you a lot from your bill (but feel free to tip your awesome waiters on the base price, because they deserve it!)"}
{"text":"The salad bar with homemade ranch dressing was excellent! I also loved the chicken that I had for dinner. The waiter was so sweet and wonderful! I loved visiting this restaurant."}
{"text":"I Generally would not give five stars to a place that failed in service and food. I had to get up after sitting for 10 or so mins to ask the hostess if I could go ahead and start at the salad bar. I saw the sever he seemed disinterested in his job. To be honest I thought he was the busser at first.. we got our salads and the hostess was quick to get him over to our table. Maybe he was having a bad night we all do so I let it go. The sever who was in the station next to us was all over it her tables that sat after us had their orders placed and drinks quickly. When I go back I will look to see if she is there cause she hustled.. When our entrees came my GF chicken was not cooked all the way through. So at the end my server went to get the manager to look at it and talk to us about it. I wasn't going to complain about the service BUT while she was there I did only to let her know what was going on. She took the check and refused to let us pay for anything. Which was not my intention! The best part was she didn't give me a million excuses as she stated she could. No she took ownership of her restaurant and server. Because of her I will be back and I felt her, the hostess and the sever next to ours deserved the five stars...."}
{"text":"I take my elderly parents here every time they're in town from Chicago. They are snowbirds. They really enjoy the food here and most of the wait staff are friendly. The bartenders are friendly. There are a couple of men that work there that seem a bit unkept. I was there one night with a friend at bar and there was a younger looking white gentleman making the schedule for the staff with a very wrinkled shirt. I did enjoy the drinks & conversation with bartender. The coupons are great & keep us coming back. I enjoy the salad bar. The restaurant does need a bit of updating, like ripped tablecloths and older carpeting. As long as the food keeps its quality we will keep returning."}
{"text":"Ruby Tuesdays always appeals to me, because of its salad bar. There is no where else that has one like it. I usually do not come here, though. They are way over priced. . .especially for the amount of food you receive.  I came here the other day for dinner and was less than impressed. I came due to the fact that I had a coupon. We were seated right away and had a very friendly waitress. She was very diligent when it came to popping over for drink refills.   I had the salad bar and made it a combo with the three sides. The salad bar at this location has improved greatly. It was very clean and always stocked up with the toppings. It all tasted fresh and delicious. The food came out in a timely manner. The sides I got were all vegetables and swimming in butter. My boyfriend got a seafood dish that cost about $15. The plate looked like it was an appetizer and not a meal.   Overall, wouldn't come back unless there was a very good coupon. I'd rather spend my money somewhere else where I can get a good portion size for a better price."}
{"text":"This place use to be really good. My mother, sisters and I started eating here in 2007, it was our go to place. It began going down hill from there. It's unfortunate because I cannot complain about the other Ruby Tuesday chains we've visited. But this one is close and convenient. Our last visit was 2 weeks ago and we noticed how unclean the booths were, not the tables but the walls surrounding the booths. Not a pleasant visit since we were very much aware that cleanliness is not their top priority. I've noticed a change in management some months back as well. He seems to be more lenient and not really focused on service. It's not just the greeting we expect, but the overall experience has decreased.  I hope things change but until then we've decided to eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Always a great spot. We have had Christ B as out server multiple times and he is great. Food is delicious and the manager is nice as well!"}
{"text":"Hm...usually predictable and good but not tonight. The place was 80% empty yet it took 15 minutes to get our beverage order...just in time since my wife and I were discussing where else to go. On the positive side the salad bar was fresh and well stocked. We had to wait 45 minutes for our meal even though the place was mostly empty. During the wait we were entertained by a screaming match between staff. My meal was only ok . Finally, they screwed up the take-out part of our meal. We Won't be back soon."}
{"text":"Went with a friend.  We had the appetizer sampler.  Yummy.  It gave us a chance to try different flavors.  I am not a big spring roll fan, yet those were my favorites.  My friend had a burger and was very pleased.  I had the asiago peppercorn steak.  The sauce was excellent.  I think I could eat that on anything.  overall excellent meal."}
{"text":"Giefriend and I were in the mood for a salad and healthy eats , we picked the right place ! she had the new marinara pasta ! it was very delicious ! I had the salmon and it was pan fried to perfection very juicy , NOT greasy. The portion sizes were fairly small as indicated on the menu with FT being fit choices. The serves we're courteous and polite , ambiance was very nice and the restaurant was well kept. cons : maybe a bit more choices on the salad side , the aroma close to the bar was a bit strange. other then those two I'm giving it a 5 star rating because it deserves more credit."}
{"text":"My grandpa doesn't get out much and after he had the Crab Cake Dinner here last week...he has been thinking about it ever since. I think it's because he got to eat some of my aunt's Lobster Carbonara, my mom's Lobster Mac & Cheese, and some Tiramisu.   I went on their website and joined the email club. They emailed me a 2 for 1 coupon(up to $10) right away.  This time I ordered the The Ultimate Chicken Sandwich which has chicken breast topped with Havarti cheese, applewood smoked bacon, sliced avocado, and all the trimmings. With honey mustard dressing. Oh yeah, the ENDLESS FRIES! I only got one refill this time.   When the bill came, it had a card to join the email club and it said you can get a free entree. I'm not sure if that means another 2 for 1 coupon or a coupon for a free entree.  http://pages.rubytuesdayrestaurants.com/page.aspx?QS=773ed3059447707deabda7bb9014e2bc76683fcf2ec10edcbf62b7dc638cf860"}
{"text":"Food was great and the staff was very friendly. I'd eat here again if I were in the area. By the way...the desserts are awesome!"}
{"text":"Very good steak!  I guess I should try something different sometime. Very friendly and helpful waitress, and fast service.  Maybe I'll find a good Mexican food place up here."}
{"text":"Poor service -- had to wait and wait for water. Finally got up and found a manager we asked for water. When a steak ordered \"medium well\" arrived, it was rare. Gross. The waiter didn't ask about how it was until he brought our check."}
{"text":"My first problem with Ruby Tuesday is that it's a Ruby Tuesday. What good can come of eating there? I have a long and sad history of hating the RT. Here's the back story:  Back in 1997 when I was young innocent and car-less (that's CAR-less not CARE-less) and an ASU Freshman I was forced to eat at Ruby Tuesday's. My lack of transportation limited my choices to places that were close to campus and I was to snotty to take a bus. So I ate at the RT on Mill/University a lot and hated every bite I took there. The food was inedible, the service was terrible and the clientele was pretty much all broke ass ASU kiddies like me, or fat women in muumuu's who lived it up for happy hour after a hard day's work at Chase Bank on Mill. Actually, I think my ex-boyfriend cheated on me with one of those gross Chase Bank/Ruby Tuesday ladies. Ew. Shudder. I think I am actually traumatized by the thought of Ruby Tuesday's. And Mill Ave. And 1997. It was so awful in many ways. In fact, I'd like to posthumously award the old Ruby Tuesday on Mill Ave, and maybe my whole ASU experience during the 90s with ZERO STARS.  Okay, okay... back to my review of the new RT in Tempe Market Place. I'll get therapy for my entire ASU experience later because right now I have a review to write.  So fast forward to 2009. (WTF? It's 2009?) Ruby Tuesday really has stepped it up. They still are ghetto, but at least the are trying to be ghetto fabulous. I rolled up for the salad bar and some soup. Aside from the waitress bringing me a regular Coke rather than a Diet Coke, things were okay. Not spectacular. The soup sucked. But the salad bar was pretty good. I didn't even get the tummy ache (read: explosive diarrhea) that chemically treated salad bars (ie Souper Salad) usually brings. The salad bar was clean, fresh and well stocked. The waitress was a little spacey, but otherwise attentive.   Oh - one majorly annoying thing are the \"specials.\" They have all these weird-ass nonsensical promotions that are impossible to understand. Like buy 2 drinks get special prices on food, but only during certain hours and only if you are sitting in certain seats. And certain other drinks are specially priced if it's a different time - or perhaps if you are wearing blue gloves and consuming your drinks out of a pink tea cup on the moon. But only in the bar section of the moon. So confusing.  Uggg... my head hurts. Memories of 1997 are starting to come back. I better go now."}
{"text":"Fuck yeah my favorite American restaurant!! They just updated their menu and they are all amazing! Drinks are crazy good too"}
{"text":"Ruby Tuesday's is like many other restaurants. The salad bar was nice. I think they should add radishes to  the selection. Their cheddar biscuits are wonderful. The best part was the service. Maria was an excellent waitress. She was so friendly and had a smile the whole time. Thanks for the great service Maria."}
{"text":"The burger I received was EXCELLENT, I can't deny that. However.....this relatively new restaurant is desperate for a cleaning."}
{"text":"We had a great experience.  The waiter was in training and forgot to bring a couple things but overall the food tasted really good, and the manager who was training the server was on his toes, on top of everything, we had a great time. Anything extra we asked for, they brought it to us.  I would definitely go again.  The only thing I would advise the supervisor to do different, is to actually introduce himself when the server does.  Other than that everything was great."}
{"text":"While I've grown up alot since I worked at Ruby Tuesdays back in college, so had the establishment. No more is the place decked out in local and pop culture memorabilia and Tiffany lamps, it's a little more chic than it used to be....for a chain restaurant at least.   It's been a long while since I've been to Ruby Tuesday but I recently signed up for their email list which opens the doors to many perks such as BOGO coupons emailed to you, special offers and a birthday meal. I like birthdays. I like meals. When I saw I had a coupon for a free handcrafted burger soon to expire, I know where I was going for dinner!   The place is a little obscure in location-right in the middle of a business park off Arrowood and 77. You can see it easily from 77 but when I exited on Arrowood, a bit confused where to turn so I follow the red. I turned into Oak Hill Business Park then made an immediate right and there I was. It was a little slow for a Thursday night but what can you expect on a chilly night. I was dining solo so opted for the bar where I could watch hockey or hoops on one of their many tv's and was soon greeted by the bartender. She told me the selection of draft beers they have on hand (about six to seven with two types of Sam Adams, wooooo!) and was quick with a pour. I was the only chick in the bar and felt like the only one not there on business since there are three or four hotels within a 1/2 mile radius.   Even though I was getting a burger of sorts, I still scoured the menu and saw they have Sunday brunch served until 3PM, news to me, will have to check out! I got some complimentary biscuits while waiting for my food--think smaller, less cheesy knock off of Red Lobster's cheesy biscuits. Tasty and just enough to hold me over until my meal.I got the Alpine Swiss Burger which came out in no time along with their endless fries. The fries were crispy, fried, salty goodness. My only complaint is now they they are a tad more chic, the ketchup is served in ramekins and not a bottle in sight. I put ketchup on everything so I like to have a bottle within reaching distance but they were happy to offer me more when they saw I was running low. And the burger? Succulent with just enough toppings to make it fun yet not fall apart. I think the menu said it was 8 oz and it was a lot better than I expected.   I had a pleasant experience and look forward to going more now that I'm getting coupons on the regular. I'm not really big into chain restaurants but if you can offer me values for giving you business, I will be loyal. I've got my eye on the salad bar with the sneeze guard for my next visit!"}
{"text":"Food is ok..Tables are made for little people...not average sized people...Service is just OK!"}
{"text":"Why isn't there an option for NO stars?? I have never walked into a restaurant where the hostess doesn't even greet or acknowledge that you're  standing there. For an entire minute she stood there flipping menus then walked away and came back and finally seated us without even telling us to follow her. No one came to our table until 7 minutes later. The bartender walked over and asked what we want to drink, even though there were 4-5 waiters around. She returned 5 minutes later with our waters and forgot the lemons. Our appetizer didn't come for another 15 minutes. When they arrived they were stale. I waited for the bartender to come back so I could tell her but she was busy making drinks needless to say my husband and I walked out. I will never return to that ruby Tuesdays again. The sad part is that there isn't another location nearby. Very disappointed in the horrible customer service and the quality of appetizers."}
{"text":"My family and I came here for quick lunch before heading to the airport. I had the salmon with zucchini and rice pilaf. The food was good. Our waiter Jacob did a good job on checking if we need anything else and is very friendly. We will go here again when we come back here in Arizona:)"}
{"text":"Our server was so nice, that I'm pushing it up from 3 to 4 stars. She really made it seem that she cared that we had a good experience. The food was good, but not great. The small salad bar was very well taken care of and the veggies looked super fresh. I would have liked a little more variety, though. The burger was good, but very salty, and I normally add salt to everything, so I can imagine many people wouldn't be able to eat it. The biscuits were also very salty, so excessively salty food is the main reason I would only give 3 stars."}
{"text":"Always enjoy eating here. Salad bar is always stocked. Atmosphere is generally quiet."}
{"text":"This Ruby Tuesday has a fantastic manager. He always does everything he can to make your meal enjoyable. I had the shrimp & grits and it was super yummy. Hubby had the chicken blt and he saw it was very tasty. Very satisfied with our experience."}
{"text":"I stopped by last night to get a salad. Everyone knows Ruby Tuesdays has a salad bar. I partook. As far as salad bars go, it isn't scary and kept really cold and clean.   They serve Mr.Pibb."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in the smell of old flooring and musty furniture hits you hard.  I was very close to walking out but my husband wanted to stay.  The waitress was snotty at first, coming by every 2 min to see if we were ready to order.   Buffalo chicken bites- they were plain and had a little taste of freezer burn.  Spinach artichoke dip- has a taste of being processes and not fresh.  Cobb salad with chicken- this was actually good.  The chicken had flavor and was tender.  Burger- the first one had a hair in it that was discovered half way thru the burger.   We told the waitress and she was very sincere.   The manager delivered a new fresh burger with no issues.  The burger tasted great."}
{"text":"Usually, when my husband and I travel, we try not to eat at the chain restaurants, but after wandering around in unfamiliar territory in the hot sun, we recognized this restaurant.  All we wanted were drinks and appetizer to hold us over.  This fit the bill.  We sat at the bar and got a sampler appetizer.  The spring rolls and mozzarella sticks were my favorites.  The mixed drink I ordered was good, but not special.   The bartender was attentive and friendly, even though she was responsible for a few booths, too.  I would stop here again, if visiting the area."}
{"text":"Ruby Tuesdays has great food. There's amazing pasta and spectacular burgers. Their service is great and you get warm welcomings and exits. Even though their prices are a little high, I still think they deserve five stars."}
{"text":"This place is always one that is not a first choice, but it is decent enough that we keep coming back. I always do the salad bar and an appetizer, and that is usually more than enough food. Can keep loading up the plate with salads and cold pastas. They always bring out some small complimentary circular bread type thing, and my wife and I never know what it is. I give them credit for trying. There is rarely anybody in here so each time we come I am kind of surprised they are still around. Hopefully they continue to be. Would recommend for a cheaper alternative to some other places in the area."}
{"text":"Something has changed at Ruby Tuesday.  Ordinarily I don't re-review a restaurant,  especially a chain outlet where I try to maintain average expectations,  but this visit felt different and not in a good way.  I felt like some cost cutting must be in play;  several things struck me funny. Monday night would be slow I imagine,  even a \"holiday\" Monday (MLK day) and there were few parties dining,  yet the food was slow and the service was not as good as usual. And didn't we used to get cheese biscuits? The foods was good as always but the whole experience seemed....diminished. I hope it's not permanent."}
{"text":"First time I've been to this ruby Tuesday and it was great. Hostess was pleasant and greeted us with a big smile. Sat at a booth in the bar area and service was awesome. I like that they have healthy options. I had the 3 veggies and unlimited salad bar for $9.99. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"I have been to a few of these and always loved them. They usually have a great salad bar. Well this one let me down a bit. The lettuce up there was all browning and some of the veggies were on their last leg as well. It was more like a left over bar. We ordered the Broccoli Parmesan Pasta, broccoli cheese soup, the Bella Chicken and two salad bars. The pasta was OK but very dry. The Bella Chicken was terrible. I cant put my finger on why but I think the mushrooms were bad. We didn't finish it...only one bite actually. The soup was very good. I am giving it 3 stars because the server was amazing. Please get it together :)"}
{"text":"Great Staff!   Ordered for pick up. Was assisted right away and had no issues with transaction.  Asked if I needed anything else twice. Condiments and napkins in bag which is good I didn't have to ask.   I ordered Salmon with mashed potatoes and grilled zucchini. Wasn't the best SAlmon, had a little of a chalky taste. Mashed potatoes was on point and zucchini was ehh.   Another order was a bacon burger and fries. Burger was cooked well done as requested and fries were ok.   May return for something new. Diverse staff which is awesome and parking is available."}
{"text":"My husband and I have stopped at this location on a yearly basis while driving from New York to Chicago. The first time we came was due to the fact we could walk from our hotel we stayed in, cross the parking lot without moving our car - it was very convenient and we were tired. The staff has always been friendly, attentive and the food has always been very good.  They also graciously accept Ruby Tuesday's national coupons as well as email coupons from their corporate website. It can save you more than a few dollars which is very helpful. I don't quite understand some of the caustic feedback. This is a typical Ruby Tuesday - the standard salad bar you will find anywhere as well as the regular menu of burgers, steaks..... We found this Ruby Tuesday's to be clean and well stocked - even when we arrive just before 9 PM. We have stopped at this location now for five years running and have yet to have a problem. Actually we have always impressed by the good service we received and would recommend this location to anyone without hesitation. We will probably stop at this location again on our next annual trip - we feel fortunate to find this place when there isn't much to choose from. We gave a rating of four stars - we rate in comparison to what is available in the area. We honestly feel this is one of the best choices in the Streetsboro area thus the better than average star rating."}
{"text":"Oh my God. Whoever the people are that are giving this place good reviews must be used to eating poop covered dog food. Worst tacos I've ever had, salad bar seemed like it was set out sometime in the 1970's, pretty sure the mashed potatoes were soaked in urine instead of butter and the marinara sauce was cooked in a boot instead of a pot. Couldn't wait to get out of there and go brush my teeth. GOOD BYE, RUBY TUESDAY!"}
{"text":"Another visit and more issues. I don't know that this place will be on our approved list of dinner stops anymore. Typically they've been out of anything we try to order then get the order wrong when we do get something.   Tonight is no different however they had everything we asked for they just don't know how to cook medium on a steak. It was more than well done.   After alerting the server she took it back and it took longer to get even though it was to cook less. It came back to be medium rare instead of medium and my veggies were very hot but raw. Talented cook to make that happen lol  The manager did make it right by removing it. So service ok, good zero especially for the price."}
{"text":"Absolutely  awful from the rude hostess at front door to the lack of service  at the table. Once seated we  waited for 10-15 minutes to be greeted. Offered cheddar biscuits but didn't receive for 1/2 hr while we were still waiting for our entrees.  Biscuits came out burnt and dry w quick brush of butter on top to try and revive them. Manager had his hands full dealing with upset guests waiting endlessly for their food. We waited over an hour only to be served Luke warm ribs . Cold Mac and cheese and chicken. Fresco with core ends of tomato and no lemon sauce with quick brush of balsamic on it.absolutley awful dinner after waiting so long. Witnessed both our server and the rude hostess use foul language 3 feet from our table. Manager stopped by and acted like he wanted to hear but he was much if the problem as he appeared clueless and had no people skills. Upon leaving a server who was still on sitting outside on his cell phone . Really topped off a disastrous time"}
{"text":"First time at a Ruby Tuesday for me. Stopped in around 2pm for lunch. We were seated right away. Our server came over promptly and greeted us.   We ordered a Smokehouse Burger and the Shrimp Scampi. Skipped the fries and mashed potatoes and she asked if we would like to substitute something else. Decided on extra veggies. They have a nice looking salad bar too. Will have to try that another time.  Our food came out quickly. Everything was hot. I was impressed with the flavors. The shrimp tasted fresh and was not bland or overcooked. The side of broccoli and zucchini was seasoned just right and tender crisp. The hamburger was supposed to be cooked medium and it was! Wow, it was a nice size. Juicy and flavorful! It was nice to go somewhere that could cook a burger!  Our server was very pleasant and checked on us several times.  Great place! Delicious food!"}
{"text":"Ruby Tuesday used to have this fabulous menu; with the best boneless chicken wings and hot sauce, the best white chicken chili, the best everything!  This used to be my favorite place to come.  Then... they changed the decor, changed the menu, and ruined it.   The night we went to this particular location, our waitress was either extremely overwhelmed or extremely horrible.  I ordered a sangria that I didn't get until the END of the meal.    Our food was so mediocre that it left me wishing I'd just cooked.  The only tasty thing was our little shrimp dip appetizer, and that's just a ripoff of Red Lobster's lobster version.  Our bill was huge, the service was awful, and the food was worse.   The only good thing I have to say is that I do like the decor.  Very sad."}
{"text":"Not much for chain restaurants, but this place delivered a quality burger.  I had the triple prime cheeseburger that was cooked exact to my order, service was attentive and prices are decent."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre and over priced. I can really only compare it to Applebee's and chili's which are both better than this. The restaurant was slow and our server was terrible. He only stopped by our to take our order and bring us the food and the check. He was not friendly at all. Our food came out almost cold. I don't like to complain at restaurants so I just sucked it up. When I actually got to tasting the food it just wasn't good and definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"Great meal and the portions are perfect. And priced right too. Service is only mediocre though; wait staff not very attentive. But the thing that is the most aggravating is it is too darn dark! Get some better lighting so I can see what I'm eating!"}
{"text":"so i had the chicken bella. I had the white cheddar mash. And spaghetti squash marinara.  Mash was great, right hint of seasonings, the spaghetti squash marinara, was bland. had no flavor.  Chicken was good had a parmesan cream sauce, a little hint of spice but i enjoyed it. great addition was the portabella mushrooms. my friend had the seafood festival mix. It all looked good, but didn't taste since it was all crab and lobster, and I am allergic. She liked it. we had the appetizer of Asian Dumplings, suprisingly good. I believe it had water chestnuts, and they were sliced big, so it kind of gotten in the way of the chicken goodness of the dumpling, but that's just me. This place is a little more upscale than chili's and applebee's. the food was great and so was the service. Couldn't complain or expect nothing more, than what it is, a chain that served American Fare. It is the only one left in Vegas. Because the one in Summerlin closed."}
{"text":"Well, where to start? Let's see we sat down and got our drinks ( good thing they were all waters ) Our waiter then took our orders, so far so good. Well that is where it ended. My mother and I got each other's orders, I got the turkey burger and she got a well done hamburger. Well, she got my turkey burger and I got her well done burger. The waiter says that he messed the order up but it was the kitchen that messed it up. So the waiter did the right thing and made the order right. The manager came over and apologized and said our food would be right out. That took close to 30 min. My wife and kids already had eaten and our food arrived, finally. The meal for me was good and my mom enjoyed hers the kids liked theirs, my wife later told me that her burger was well done and she asked for a med. this was not a big deal because she was hungry. When the check came my wife said that they should have taken one or two burgers off the bill because of the screw up....... Nothing was taken off. We will not be back to this restaurant , and would not recommend this  restaurant  to anyone. Oooooooooh by the way they had no more then 15 people in the restaurant and had 6-8 waiters...... Sad we use to like this place"}
{"text":"My visit here was average. The food was moderate and the staff was nice. The best part of my lunch was the all you can eat salad bar. Nothing special about this place just another average Ruby tuesdays."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by the mediocre and terrible reviews from other people.  I was there on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and thought it was great.  Fried mozzarella sticks were good, the biscuits our waiter brought us were good, and my hickory bourbon glazed pork chop and baked potato were wonderful!  I think our waiter was new because he seemed a bit hesitant but he was very friendly and knowledgeable.  I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Blah...  We just wanted  the salad bar, but it turned out to be quite mediocre with not as many items as I would have expected for over $10. Our server was kind, but lots of time went between our beverage fill ups. Not a bad visit, but there are better salad bars around at better prices."}
{"text":"it's your typical, TGIF, Chili's...etc kinda eatery ... but if you've seen their commercials you'll know why we were determined to find one when we were in Vegas... (the closest one to LA is like in Fresno).    we went for lunch and my bf ordered the Triple Prime Burger 100% USDA Prime beef with prime tenderloin, prime rib eye and prime sirloin fresh ground, blended and grilled while I ordered the Bella Turkey Burger with Swiss and Baby Portabella Mushroom.  His burger was really good.... but my turkey burger was out of this world...  my mouth salivates as i'm thinking about it.    price-wise it was the standard tgif, chili price, portions are fairly large.  service was good and the restaurant was clean...  next time we're in Vegas we're definitely stopping by again.  i'm only giving it 1 star less because there isn't one near me!!  =("}
{"text":"Paid $4 for each of these 2 soups.  Ordered to go.  Containers were half full! Between both soups I had paid $8 total with enough soup to fill a single bowl.  There is better value elsewhere. Small portions here!"}
{"text":"Ruby Tuesday for lunch, wanted a salad. Salad bar was fresh except for blue cheese dressing, looked kinda funky, I didn't take a chance. Had a chicken sandwich, good, service was excellent."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE! The hostess acted like he was shocked customers walked in the door. Once seated our waitress seemed lost. She had no clue what drinks they had, my daughter asked for a fruit punch after seeing it in the menu. The waitress said they didn't have it, showed it was on the menu and she later brought out a juice box. It took forever to get drinks. The salad bar was almost empty. When my dinner came the rice pilaf was completely inedible. It was cold, under cooked and totally dry. The white cheddar brussle sprouts were disgusting, under cooked, covered in WAY to much cheese and loads to grease. I will NEVER come back. The food was awful. The service was awful. This place sucks!"}
{"text":"Even though we had a party of more than 25 the waitress was on point. She was so attentive that I gave her 10% more than was included...so she got roughly 28% from me.   The food was actually really good. I had the ribeye steak and loaded baked potato with steamed broccoli. I couldn't get any alcohol because there was a minster there but I had a good time anyway. The atmosphere was great. We closed the place down."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this Ruby Tuesdays a 3 instead of a 2 is the friendly staff. Long over due a remodel and industrial cleaning, this location has gone down hill with the franchise. Under stocked salad bar was not fresh and depleted by 700PM. The burger was fair. Seems like the staff lacks resources to help this struggling location. I would probably go somewhere else if I had to choose again."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Went early so it wasn't busy and had the salad bar and ribs. I was very impressed with the salad bar as everything was fresh, stocked and it was clean.  The ribs were tasty and the service was very good. I can't believe we have not went here before. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place should close their last one here!  I'm sure it would not be missed!  I ordered salad bc I thought they were known for their fresh salad bar which looked unappetizing as we walked in the door.  The salad i ordered was not fresh and tasted awful!  My husband got some pork chop which looked appetizing on the menu but when it came looked like a microwave porkchop with bottled dressing poured over it and could literally cut it with a fork.  Nassssty!  Waitress never asked how everything was bc she knew it was gross too.  I'd have been embarrassed serving such slop and unfresh salad.  The entrees were not cheap either.  The bill for 3 was about $60.  I will NEVER set foot in that place again!   Wasted money, wasted food!"}
{"text":"Ordered the grilled salmon. it was swimming in a pool of oil...obviously from frozen as the center was still raw. Was offered cheesecake for desert from the manager... it was frozen."}
{"text":"Fresh new restaurant. Great service. Lots of wine choices. We will be back wish wish there was none in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"the good - pork chop and mashed potatoes (sample size) were very good and thick and tasty.  the bad - expensive for a pork chop the bad - golf ball size serving of mashed potatoes.  management fyi - there is no food item that costs less than a frikin potato! they are a penny per ounce. give a double portion of what you are currently giving, it will cost you less than a dime and the plate will be more impressive looking.  would only go back if had buy 1 get 1 free, not 50% off."}
{"text":"The last two visits to this Ruby Tuesdays have succeeded in ending my business with same. Service was not bad, but the food quality was below poor."}
{"text":"We decided to come here because it was next to the American Sports Center and we had a couple of hours to kill til our next game. Food was okay, not great. A little on the pricey side for the quality of food. We didn't get the salad bar, but it did look clean and nice."}
{"text":"The service friendly, but is very slow. The food was very below average. The apple fizz drink was good. I had the turkey a avocado burger with fries and could not eat it. Not only was it luke-warm-cold , it just was not edible.  I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ruby Tuesdays is always an evolving change.   The salad bar which was one of their biggest attractions has cut back on the number of items available.   At the same time the side items on the menu have increased in depth and taste.     The food was okay ... not the best and not the worst ... just average.   RT seems to want to become an above average place but they are missing it on the details.    Wait staff was okay they did come around a number of times.  For as slow as it was, i would have expected more attentive staff.  Additionally, the staff could have been cleaning the place more as it was slow."}
{"text":"I usually love to go here a few times a month but after bragging and then taking my friend I'm not so sure I will go back..the food was less than par..cold to be exact not just one item my spring rolls and my cheese fries .Great service but I need good food."}
{"text":"Unlike our previous experiences, our Saturday night visit was disappointing. The food was ho-hum and portions much smaller. They also eliminated the cheese rolls. One entree came out 2 minutes after the side salad appeared.  The server did ask if everything was ok but left before we could even respond. No drink refills were provided. So disappointing as Ruby Tuesday was a favorite!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is so dirty, I can't even believe it. The women's restroom is beyond disgusting. It makes me concerned with what the kitchen looks like. The plastic cups they serve water in have a brown tint to them that I couldn't drink a thing. So gross."}
{"text":"So I was craving for a really good salad a couple of days ago and of course a nice salad bar at Ruby Tuesday came into mind especially after hearing about their new 55 ingredient salad bar. So my husband and I came, got seated, and I searched for my usual  quesadilla and salad bar combo.  After searching and not finding,  I asked the waitress about it. She informed me that they now have a NEW menu and the quesadillas are NO LONGER on the menu. So of course I was shocked and had a hard time knowing what else to get with my salad bar entrée.  So I ended up just eating salad.  Don't get me wrong, the salad bar was GREAT! They had every ingredient I would want on my salad EXCEPT diced turkey. They have diced ham, but that's not my preference. Other than that, it was delicious. I even went back up for a second plate.  So the salad bar was worth it in the long run. But towards the end of dinner I did request that the  quesadilla entrée be returned and that an addition of diced turkey be added to the salad bar. I really hope my requests are heard and acknowledged."}
{"text":"The food here was great, the service good, and parking was good.  The only things I might have a problem with is, The prices are a little on the higher side as You get a burger and it costs about $12, and you only get to choose 1 side, so when you get your plate it looks kind of bare.  And I like Salads so I picked the \"Salad bar\"  On the commercials it looks like its 15 feet long with everything.  But in fact it has less then the bare minimum for a Salad bar.  Just lettuce, about 6 toppings and 5 dressings.  I mean when I want a salad, I want enough choices that I could make a cobb salad of sort, not just lettuce and dressing.  Other then those 2 things, it was a pretty nice place."}
{"text":"Came around 3:00 and the doors were locked, saw 6 or 7 employees sitting and chatting at a booth once one came and let us in. Salad bar was great but after we watched a kid stick her fingers in the dressing we couldn't go back. Ruby Tuesday always has great food but the service here stinks. Bathroom was disgusting, water glasses dirty, seems like the owner of manager must not be in often and the employees are running it to the ground. We'll be going to the Tempe location from now on."}
{"text":"We are huge fans of the pretzel burger - delicious!! Be sure to sign up for their e-club or grab a coupon from the paper. They almost always have a BOGO offer or $10off/$30+ deal going. Their apps are a little spendy. Mozzarella sticks are ok. Didn't care for the chips and cheese - dip tasted like bean dip and was heavily seasoned.  I love their biscuits - yummy! Salad bar I think is overpriced at $8.99.   Loss of a star because service is a toss up - sometimes it's good, sometimes not so good. Never excellent. We usually go before 5pm, so maybe they don't have their all stars on staff at that time, I don't know. Overall good and will keep going back."}
{"text":"I grade on what a place advertises itself to be.  This Ruby's is exactly what you want it to be, and exactly what you'd expect.  The staff was most friendly, and the food was most fresh for my lunch between Mid-Michigan and Washington DC."}
{"text":"After raving about my last visit to Ruby's I was overly excited when my girlfriends said they wanted to have dinner here. However, this visit just did not wow me.  We arrived a little after 6:30 the hostess was able to get us to a booth quickly. However, we waited....and waited until our waitress finally came over and the first thing she says to us is \"looks like you're stuck with me tonight\" Now, I don't know much about being a waitress (ok..ok I don't know anything about it) but I'm sure there's a better intro for your customers...or maybe that's just the new \"thing\" and I'm just not hip to it.  Anywhoo on to my meal:  Pomegranate Lemonade- I was a bit turned off by the price ($3.49) a glass BUT they do offer refills and each one is freshly made. This drink is freaking delicious. Worth every penny, not too sweet or sour, just the right amount of pomegranate juice....Soooooo good! Get it! Get it! Get it!   Salad Bar- Meh. It needed to be replenished and there were toppings dropped all around the containers, some of the lettuce had browned and the worse part was that my favorite croutons were stale. Hopefully, this was just a \"wrong time...wrong day\" experience.   Spicy Fish Tacos- Welp..the presentation was lacking. But the tacos tasted great. The fish was very well seasoned, with lettuce and cheese with a delicious spicy ranch sauce.   Overall, this visit was just okay. Didn't knock my socks off but I really enjoyed my lemonade and the food was good.  So I'll make sure to give them another shot."}
{"text":"They have outstanding burgers - juicy and full of flavor. I tried the pretzel burger the other night and it was so delicious!  They often have pretty good coupons in the mail too, so keep your eye out (buy one get one half off makes date night under $20)! We got the chips and quest appetizer last time, loved the chips not so much the queso.  It loses its star due to the salad bar. I feel like they make such a huge deal about it when really it doesn't offer much. I'd like to see them add more fruit and maybe some cottage cheese. Service has always been great, however the hostess could have worn a longer skirt (we saw way too much every time she walked by)"}
{"text":"Standard Ruby Tuesday location. Same salad bar options. Same decor. This location lacks speedy customer service, however. I ordered a lemonade and it took forever to get a refill. I understand it is made in the bar, but some foresight would ensure that your customer isn't waiting extended periods of time before getting a refill. The one in Tempe Marketplace has MUCH better customer service! The food was good, and will keep us coming back. Free biscuits are heavenly! Would highly recommend the pretzel burger."}
{"text":"Living in Southern California, sometimes and somehow and for whatever reason I see television ads for Ruby Tuesday.  The commercials make it look like a high end burger joint and make the food look mmmmmm so good.  But the thing is.....I don't know of a Ruby Tuesday in Southern California!!!!!  arghhhhhh  So when I ended up in Arizona for my Ironman, we of course walked up and down the strip (Mills Rd) where all the college kids hang out.  We were there for a few days and so we wanted to check some places out...and lo and behold we see a Ruby Tuesday!  Because of the Ironman event the whole town was packed with tourists, families and athletes.  Ruby was not to be outdone and it too was packed.      Once inside I realized it's more along the lines of a Chili's, TGIF type of place....ummm yeah....but since it was our first time it was cool.  Ordered a pasta dish which was good...I mean we scarfed our food down.  The strawberry lemonade was good here too.    I did come here a 2nd time before we left, so I could try their steak.  Ummm yeah it's not a great steak joint haha...I mean its edible and I did eat all of my steak...but its not some fancy place they make it out to be on TV.  :P  Service was average....If I was in town...i'd perhaps come in one more time just because we don't have it in California"}
{"text":"Ordered carry-out:  Wife had Chicken Fresca and I ordered the Triple-Prime Bacon Cheddar Burger (Mid-Rare) w/ lettuce, tomato, extra pickle and Mustard & Mayo.  When I arrived inside, nobody was there up front. One employee walked passed me and didn't acknowledge me. I walked to the area where pickups are (corner of the bar). 4 employees were huddled at a table, two on their phones and laughing and joking. I waited at the bar and three of them looked up at me and went back to their laughing and joking, then one looked up again. Finally one of them turned around and came to ask what I needed which is when I expressed I was their to pick up a carry-out. She went to get it; the manager walked by the others huddled and seemed not to mind the behavior nor did he acknowledge me standing their. After a minute or two she emerged with the order and here's where I failed (I left before checking it). When I got home, my Triple Prime Cheddar Bacon Burger, cooked mid-rare, was a small burnt patty with a single slice of American cheese (Nobody can convince me this was RT's Triple Prime) I have had the burger before and it's big and juicy. I was immediately upset. I called and asked for carry-out. The employee who serviced my order seemed to think she already knew why I was called, because before I could really explain, she said \"yeah we didn't hear you say bacon\" then said \"hold on\" and put me on the phone with someone else. I would give this place one star, however, my wife's chicken wasn't horrible, so they get an extra for that alone (I'm upset but I'm still fair). Won't be back to this RT though."}
{"text":"Ok, I can't say enough good things about Ruby Tuesday. They have totally revamped their menu and salad bar, and I'm in LOVE! SO many new and delicious looking menu items it will be my new lunch with friends go to! And the new salad bar line up is a total winner! Way to go to stay fresh and competitive!"}
{"text":"Always a disappointment! We hardly come to this location but every time we do, the service is horrible! The group I go with had to ask the hostess to get us drinks and find us a waiter! The food took an extremely long time and the restaurant wasn't even busy. The waiter never re filled our glasses and we only saw him once. Need major help!"}
{"text":"Food was good until I found some glass (that was apparently in my zucchini) in my mouth. Bit down on my dinner only to have a chomp of glass breaking in my mouth. Manager was very understanding and offered free dinner. To bad I lost my appetite. Hopefully I don't wake up with a tooth ache tomorrow."}
{"text":"As far as chain places go, Ruby Tuesday is definitely a favorite, and this location did not disappoint!! Their salad bar is always top notch- they continuously work at keeping everything loaded up, and there is 4 kinds of lettuce to choose from here! I was so happy not to have to be stuck with icky iceberg!  Service was great- present, but not overbearing.   I ordered a turkey avocado burger with fries. Fries were hot, crispy, but a little flat on flavor. The burger was juicy and delicious. I love their cocktails, but we stuck with waters here. The price is right too- most burgers are 9.99 (and so so good!!) and then you can tack on the salad bar for 1.99 more!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Salad bar was messy and needed refilling. Food was okay. Nothing special. Service was good."}
{"text":"Ick. Bathrooms very nasty. Server was rude. Food only so so. Would go elsewhere for the money."}
{"text":"So let me preface my review by giving you a little backstory. I have been coming to the Ruby Tuesdays once a year for the last 5 years. There is an annual golf tournament that my dad, his friends and I attend and we stay at a nearby hotel. We have a routine where after we check in we b-line it to this location and have dinner and Long Island ice teas (this year we had 5 each) the service is some of the best service I have ever had at a restaurant and I doubt if I could get this kind of service anywhere else. By now we have become familiar faces and they roll out the carpet for us. The crazy part is that they have retained their staff over the years which is unheard of in the food industry.  I start with the salad bar which is amazing., and I ordered a burger this time. The burger was cooked perfect and tasted absolutely incredible. The main reason we cone is for the drinks. The long islands are one of a kind and we have even tried to mimic them at home to no avail. The server that helps us is the coolest and even showed my friend how he makes the drinks so unique. He sits and laughs with us and to top things off he made us a special drink on our last round which was oversized! This place is unlike any other that I have been to and since it is a chain that speaks volumes. I'll see you next year! Can't wait!"}
{"text":"It has been many years since my husband and I had Ruby Tuesdays simply because there isn't a location close to us anymore. We hoped that the food was still as good as it use to be and sadly it was not.  The salad bar was mediocre the ranch was like water and completely flavorless.  My husband had the asiago strip steak and spit out a fourth of it because it was fatty, the mashed potatoes weren't great either.  I had the appetizer buffalo chicken strips they were surprisingly moist but nothing to write home about.  The cost of four pretty small strips was 7.99 that's 2.00/ea definitely not worth it, the only reason I am giving three stars is because everyone was very nice and the restaurant looked nice and was very clean."}
{"text":"Ruby Tuesday's Customer Service contacted me below wanting me to \"tell them more\" on their website.    What else do I need to tell them more about?     10.  X = Ruby Tuesday's Odor 20.  Y = Sewer 30.  Z = Pleasant 40.  IF X = Y THEN PRINT \"EW\" 50.  IF X = Z THEN PRINT \"YAY\" 60.  RUN  70.  OUTPUT X = Y  80.  EW 90.  IF \"EW\" is not understood, GOTO 10"}
{"text":"These guys have decent food and a decent atmosphere. I thought it was a bit overpriced for the companies it competes with. Other than that, this place has a nice salad bar, cordial staff and short wait times. They are worth trying, especially if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Place is a nightmare to find, especially at night.   The area is so congested.   I called the restaurant and their directions were useless.  By the time I finally found the place my takeout was cold.   There was NO parking the the restaurant lot so I had to find a place in a nearby business.  The steak was ok, but the baked potato was way overcooked and mushy."}
{"text":"Very cold inside, we had to ask for the AC to be turned off. There weren't many patrons. Food took a long time, and my order was incorrect. Waitress was friendly."}
{"text":"Awful, awful food! Will never go again! My friend ordered a burger medium and it was well-done. She did not order the mushroom burger but got them anyway. She also ordered grilled onions instead of raw onions and got both. I ordered a burger well-done and it was almost burnt! I ordered mashed potatoes instead of fries and they were totally cold. Could have sent everything back, I guess, but we didn't."}
{"text":"Meh. The chicken strips were more like shriveled chicken nuggets. We ate here as a last resort. Should have just made fish sticks."}
{"text":"the whole reason im not giving this place a 1-2 star is because our waiter was such a nice guy and so helpful. the prices are on the very high side which i was really shocked at. two of my kids got chocolate milk, which they don't tell you that refills are not free! so they got a 2nd refill on them and i pretty much paid 10 dollars on the bill on chocolate milk alone! the food was OK nothing to woohoo about. over all our waiter was really good with the kids he got stuff we needed, he did forget about water for one of the kids after his 2nd glass of chocolate milk. it wasn't too busy. seemed a lot of the workers were behind the bar just chatting away and not doing anything. im also glad that our waiter didn't freak out when our 5 year old threw up her broccoli i felt so bad for him but he said no problem. more then likely might not go back."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time. Salad bar not replenished. Food not warm or as pictured. Server had a bad attitude. French fries came out cold. Ask for new ones came back hot but with so much salt on them they were not edible. Manager no help beware"}
{"text":"I forget about Ruby Tuesday's a lot. I'm not really sure why, I  enjoy the food and service and I LOVE the salad bar but it just never comes to mind when looking for something to eat out.  However, after my last visit that will definitely change!  My friends and I met for dinner and the place was not that busy. We were promptly seated and our waitress was Lindsey....she was phenomenal! Seriously, adorable, prompt and just seemed to really enjoy her job. I really hope she never loses her charm! She's definitely a big win for the restaurant.   We started with drinks....$5 cocktails ALL day...well I don't mind if I do! I ordered a red sangria. It was yummy. It definitely had a good about of alcohol in it and real chucks of apples and berries so that was a nice touch.   For my meal, I went with the New Orleans Seafood which is tilapia topped with grilled shrimp in a parmesan cream. For my sides, I chose the salad bar and a baked potato.   Okay, little known gem that our adorable waitress offered up....everything on the salad bar is prepared fresh in the kitchen, that means they cut up fresh onions, cucumbers, tomatoes, REAL bacon, eggs, ham...even the potato and pasta salads are prepared fresh in the kitchen. Huge win.   Well of course the salad bar was awesome! Two helpful hints: 1. They use REAL bacon. 'Nuff said. 2. Whatever you do....GET the croutons. Seriously, I could eat a plate of them! You'll thank me later.   The tilapia and shrimp were winners as well. Excellent size portions, the seasoning was spot on and both paired perfectly with the parmsean sauce. Yum!   We left happy, full and with leftovers. And in my book that's good stuff!"}
{"text":"I don't see why this place even got 3.9 stars. Me and my boyfriend are very easy to please. We don't order a lot, we always get something simple to make, and all we ask is a bit of friendliness and maybe a smile or two. Whenever I am here, I do not get that. The very first time I came here, the service was nice(Mind you, this was almost two years ago). I went back again, only to have my burger completely messed up. I decided to give them another chance, however then, they completely ignored us for a half hour. By this, I mean we were there for a half hour(No exaggeration, it was pathetic) before we were even asked if we wanted drinks or anything. I don't complain, but I made to sure write them a note on their receipt that it was horrible service and that we weren't planning on coming back again. I felt bad though, because the waiter who ended up helping us was really nice, so he still got a 20 percent tip. I never wanted to return again. Well recently, my boyfriend was craving one of their entrees so we decided to go back in. Horrible service. This bartender, Kelsey, was our server and this was during a time with barely any people in the restaurant- only a handful of people. She barely glanced at us, didn't greet us, and then when she finally came over, all she managed was a \" What do you want to drink?\", before running off. Rude. But again, I am easy going. (Mind you, this is all after standing at the front for 5 minutes without a hostess even there to help us) But throughout the whole process, she forgot my boyfriend's silverware and my burger was messed up AGAIN. Mind you, this is not Kelsey's fault. It's the kitchen. I ordered a plain burger, how hard is that really? No, the only thing that Kelsey's fault is the fact that her service is horrible. As soon as her friends walked in and were sat in her section though, she paid only attention to them, and it took her a good 10 minutes after we were done eating to even give us the bill. Don't go here. It's not even worth it and that is coming from someone who is easy-going.  If it's TLDR; Basically, the service sucks and you're likely to get your food messed up."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience! The place was filthy and had ants crawling everywhere, the waitress was rude and the food was terrible! Their idea of a burger is a piece of meat on a wheat bun, and they burned the pasta. The fact that this place can be considered a good restaurant just blows my mind!   Apparently if you put terrible food on a fancy plate it makes it more valuable........."}
{"text":"Worst RT I have ever been in. I'm a business traveler and appreciate good service and in this place I guess any kind of service would have been nice. From no hostess and finding my way into the bar, bartender seeing me and no reaction to the typical question \"What are you having tonight\", this place misses the service mark. A server (maybe the Mgr as he had on a different colored shirt) did come see me after I got up and headed to the bar to get order and retrieve my own beer. After the food was delivered that was it for any interaction with staff. I did get up and ordered and received beer 2. I had the Triple Play, greasy shrimp and chicken strips with chewy ribs. The high point was the cold Coors Light, the bar server after no contact through the complete meal, picked up my empty plate and asked if I wanted desert, I smiled and said no thanks. I will not be back, it's a shame as it is close to hotels and would be a business travelers stop for dinner. Many other choices, my recommendation would be to choose another. Why is good service and good food sometimes so hard to come by? Other RT's are great so it's not the brand, it's this location."}
{"text":"This place is no longer there as of 03/01/2009. There's a new one on 44th street by the airport."}
{"text":"Ya' know, I liked visiting this place for the salad bar. But it seems to have lost some of its appeal for me. It was pretty mediocre last visit. I mean, it was simply, nothing special. Other than that, everything else was adequate. This location is close to the airport, so its a convenient pre-flight stop before traveling. Better to tank up here than play the \"airport food game.\" No thanks."}
{"text":"I've tried other locations, and liked this chain a lot. However, Had lunch here, just the salad bar and an iced tea, and wasn't impressed at all. Very ordinary, nothing different, unusual, or even that good. Yeah, sure... It was clean, well stocked, yada-yadda... But I just wanted a quick bite and it set me back 14 bucks (w/  tip). Not worth it! Service was really good though."}
{"text":"I write this with some sadness since we've gone many times over the last 7-10 years but as time went on some cheapskate accountant someplace obviously put profit over diners. Over the years the menu whittled down, the salad bar chopped and quality given second place.   This store in particular by the San Tan mall has been in a decline. Not long ago--they brought in cheap shrimp hiding under the breading. When I checked--it was not deveined (in other words the pooper was still there and full). That's well, nasty. Cooked poop is not much better a concept.   My last trip, literally last to there, was a few days ago. We were escorted to a table that had piles of food stuff on the floor. The area was NOT cleaned and they were trying to sit us there. They moved us to a different table and we ordered some ham chunks and cheese from the kitchen because my kid has a food allergy and the salad bar has massive cross-contamination problems. They brought it to my kid and I was asked \"what's this?\" The cheese was moldy. We were shocked said don't eat that and told he waitress. Who told a manager and proceeded to leave it in front of my kid for 20 minutes, never clearing it away until I asked. Now a manager comes and while very nice, tells me he threw away the cheese from the salad bar since well it came from the same source. My spouse, who had only ordered a salad promptly stops eating. As did my other kid, mid salad.  The manager did nothing about the bill. I got a $60 bill for a meal one kid could not eat, the other stopped eating and my spouse that ate nothing at all. The lack of AT LEAST comp'ing the bill was the last straw on a terrible evening that capped a multi-year decline in service and offerings.  One can do much better elsewhere for similar money. And don't get me wrong, the people there are nice and when I called later to say what they hell was that. He was very apologetic and said next time, next time tell someone about it and they'd make it right next time. Except there will never be a next time. You need to get it right the first time. Because next time they might say who? Never heard of that manager. And with lousy food options even under good circumstances it's not worth it any more.  FYI this is my first reivvew of this kind. It was so bad I HAD to say something."}
{"text":"First of all, just letting you know I have no affiliation with the restaurant but let me just say....  The Ruby Tuesday at Craig/Revere is delicious...  It is hard to find a great restaurant experience anymore especially one with a very adequate wonderful salad bar...  Everytime we go we are very pleased(went Friday night Feb 9)....  With 2 of us our bill was $48 and change total...  It would have been lower but I got their biggest domestic draft beer and the girlfriend got their biggest Chardonnay....  I had the chicken fresco with bake potato and substituted the salad bar for $1.99 extra instead of 2 sides..  Girlfriend had the petite sirloin with mashed potato and added the salad bar also.....  I walked out feeling the most satisfied from a restaurant experience in a long time...  There was another gentleman complimenting the experience he had with the hostess also when we left....  Not here to knock Applebee's but their food is always over salted & we have just never enjoyed it enough to want to keep going back but Ruby Tuesday we will be back..."}
{"text":"super bad service on multiple occasions!  6.99 burgers are so good, real shame!  Ended up talking to manager and they comped bill.  When seated we waited 10 minutes for server to come and take order; placed order then took another 15 minutes just to get the drinks.  Ordered sauces with the order, when food came w/o we asked again and then 15 minutes later they came, food was then cold from waiting.  From arrival to departure 75 minutes for ordering 2 burgers to getting bill.  Asked for water refill, took 20 minutes - came as waitress delivered OTHER tables drinks.  Manger was awesome though, however don't think we'll be back :(."}
{"text":"Went back after about a year to give them another chance. Mistake! Service was slow to begin with. Tea was good and salad bar was good but out of crackers. I ordered chicken strips and fries. Chicken strips were small in size and portion was small with 4 strips each about 3\" in length. They were not crisp and quite soggy. Fries were alright. Nothing special. This meal was in a basket! They actually brought a bottle of catsup.  Before you used to get tiny cup of catsup. Overall my wife and I did not enjoy our meals at all. See her review for details. We got all this for only $37....."}
{"text":"Very disappointing last night although it's been OK in the past.  Lettuce and mushrooms on salad bar were brown.  Steak was so overcooked and dried out I had to send it back.  Then they brought me another very overcooked and dried out steak (no pink at all when I ordered medium).  Waiter agreed it was way overcooked and offered to take it back but I didn't want to wait for a 3rd."}
{"text":"i don't know  what's  up with this place, oh wait yes i do poor management!  manager jj or bj is a real racist asshole who seems to be over compensating  for something  hmmmm..... waitress was very unattentive and seemed  to be playing  musical waiters as so many different  employees  came to my table to refill and drop off food. with this many employees  in a half dead restaurant  why was my waitress m. i. a. ?  even with all the extra help refills took forever. staff is too busy socializing to do thier job. plus roaches and flys in the salad bar and even mice cutting you off at the ankles. never again!!!  i'm pretty critcal of most places but i'd sooner get a hot dog from the circle k in front before i ever eat here. don't waste your money or your time!"}
{"text":"There waiters are inexperienced,  food okay, if you just cant find food any where else. Wait  to long to be poor service, be slow in store, waitress had tables including us They dont prebus or refill drinks"}
{"text":"This place is what restaurants should strive to be. I've gone there every night this week (staying on the hotel next door for work) and I've yet to see one employee with a poor attitude. The entire staff is completely courteous and always getting involved with their customers. I ate every night by myself and the bartender always stopped by to ask how I was and if I needed anything or just to chat a sec. The manager was always helping out and going around and talking to all the guests.  The food was cooked very well and consistent. My favorite was the chicken fresco with grilled zucchini and rice. Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Cajun Seafood (not really Cajun, but still good), garden salad bar and white sangria. A bit pricey, but yummy."}
{"text":"Love RT. The salad bar is small but always stocked with fresh, high-quality items. I love their zuchini miniburgers. The staff is always friendly. And, I get coupons in the mail or newspaper for great savings. Doesn't get any better."}
{"text":"Yes, I am reviewing a Ruby Tuesday, but I have a valid reason for doing so, so just deal with it.  The boyfriend and I went for a late lunch/early dinner, and I opted to add the salad bar to my meal.  As I was loading up my plate with lots of veggies, I noticed that at least half of the grape tomatoes were moldy/rotten.  No big deal, veggies spoil easily and maybe no one noticed.  here's the problem.  I grab one of the staff members (not sure if he was a waiter or host) and say, \"Just so you know, there are a lot of moldy tomatoes on the salad bar.  You might want to swap them out.\"  What does he do?  He just looks at me.  So I then say, \"it's not a huge deal or anything, I just thought you should know.\"  And he says, \"Uhm, ok\" and goes on his merry way.  When we left the restaurant, I checked out the salad bar and the rotten tomatoes were still there.  Look, I know things happen in restaurants, I'm not naive.  But if a customer points out visibly rotting food on your salad bar, you should damn well do something about it.  Perhaps this should have been a warning sign to me, but it wasn't.  After spotting the roteen maters, I returned to my table, ate my salad, and ate my lunch giving the place the benefit of the doubt.  No exaggeration, within a mere 10 minutes of leaving the restaurant, both the boyfriend and me had horribly upset tummies.  We hardly made in home in time.  I think perhaps this particular Ruby Tuesday should be avoided."}
{"text":"I normally never complain about anything, it is just not in my nature, but I had a weird experience today and I just thought you should have a heads up. Last time I went to Ruby Tuesday my family and I had a great experience, so this time we decided to come and enjoy ourselves again.   This time, was not as great. My waitress was nice, gave us refills, and was nice to my kids got everyone's order right but mine. I ordered the chicken strips meal (the small portion, which comes with four pieces of chicken and a side of fries.) I added a salad bar, which was yummy, but then when my food came I was missing my side of fries. She said that she substituted out my side of the fries for the salad bar, which is something I never agreed to. She said she could bring me an order of fries for an additional cost! What? lol. I said I was fine, at this point I just wanted to eat my tiny four pieces of chicken that I paid ten dollars for, so whatever.  But, when I got my check I was surprised to see that she had not substituted out but instead charged me 1.99 for the salad bar. Now look, I know at some places the salad bar is extra, but you cannot tell me that you switched out my side of fries for a salad bar and then charge me for it. That is not a sub, that is an add on.   So in total for my four tiny pieces of chicken I paid 9.99 and then an additional 1.99. and that is not including my 3 dollars for my drink as well. I basically paid roughly 15 dollars and was missing the fries that it automatically is supposed to come with. And she would have charged me for the fries that I was supposed to get. To put this into perspective my husband got a full steak meal with two sides and only paid a couple of bucks more then me.   I already sent my email info to corporate, I actually really liked my server, but I feel she needs to listen better and then don't assume that someone wants something a certain way when you didn't even ask them.   My whole check for a family of five was 67 dollars, not including the 7 dollar tip I left (I usually leave at least 10-15, but not this time)  The value was definitely not worth it. I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The salad bar is one of the best aspects of this restaurant chain. The menu update and interior update has made Ruby Tuesday's a much more enjoyable experience in a nice environment."}
{"text":"Had a very disappointing experience in your restaurant today. We were the only table our waitress had when we got there. We ordered an appetizer, which she forgot to ring in and then tried to have it made for us to have after our meal. She pretty much threw down our checks on the table mid meal. Horrible personality and needs training. Cormeia (?) I believe was her name. One of the worst waitresses I've had in awhile."}
{"text":"This was the dirtiest restaurant I have been in a long time. We had to ask that the booth be wiped down before we could sit in it. While we were eating our mediocre food we noticed that the wall in the booth and the table itself were filthy! They need to shut down for a day and clean their restaurant. The only good thing about our experience was dessert. We had the peanut butter thingy. It was not bad."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at this location.  Great food and the general manager was at the facility and treated us great.   My daughter loved the strawberry lemonade.  Recommend coming by."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our evening at Ruby Tuesday's. Unfortunately, my husband's order was made wrong 4 separate times as a side dish instead of the entree. And took more than 45 minutes to get after receiving our food. Our waiter Logan H. was very exuberant and had done an amazing job trying to accommodate us. He offered the entree to us for free as well as dessert and salad bar. He also honored our coupon. We weren't looking for free food but he did his absolute best to not keep my hubby waiting. Regardless of how many times the food was made wrong, I will definitely be back because of the staffs great attitudes."}
{"text":"Either computer system, staff or both are incompetent. I put in a to go order online for the second and last time I will be ordering. Last time they didn't even start the order until I arrived at my pickup time. This time after placing my order  I called to be sure it was received first they couldn't find it, then asked if i was sure I placed it to their store (I got the number from the bottom of the order) and I finally asked for a manager who also couldn't find it, then went to the kitchen and saw they had it. Picked it up, they had made one of the burgers wrong, all of the appetizers were overcooked and burgers and fries were soggy. This will be the last visit there, they are awful. No wonder this place is always almost empty."}
{"text":"Looks better in the commercials. We don't have one of these in San Diego, but see the commercials all the time, so i was excited to try it since it was next to our hotel!   Generic food, but fun service! ...their salad bar does not look good either."}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars. We will never be going to this place again or recommending it. My husband and I went with our 2 kids. I did not receive my soup until after our main dish came. The soup was luke warm and not hot. Our kids meal came ONE HOUR before ours. They are toddlers and couldn't take the wait anymore so we had to get our food to go. We should have just left. The place was dusty. They had tons of open tables but a 15 minute wait time. The waitress barely checked on us. I gave this place another shot...and they failed to impress."}
{"text":"I go there about once or twice a year. It is down the road from me. They have a pretty good salad bar, which is what I usually get with a bowel of their broccoli cheddar soup.  Service is decent."}
{"text":"This place does not appear on most GPS systems, so beware of that fact. Things were pretty quiet on a Saturday night when my party of six entered., Most people opted for the salad bar which looked fresh. Others got chicken penne parmesan (not good) and also mini-sliders that were mostly left uneaten. Turns out that my order of 1/2 rack of baby back ribs - memphis dry rub style - were the best of the bunch. The rack could have used more rub, but the meat slid off the bones and the ribs were actually quite tasty. A side of BBQ sauce helped the cause. White cheddar mashed potatoes and a solid order of string beans made for a fancy looking kind of dish at this chain. The one thing that was an issue is that in the new commercials they claim that the salad bar comes with all entrees. Well, it costs an extra $2.99 for the salad bar with the ribs or you can get those two sides included. Kind of a bait and switch in my opinion, but luckily the ribs on this night worked out for me."}
{"text":"I DO NOT RECOMMEND EATING HERE!!!!  The empty parking lot at 6pm on a weekday should have been a sign. We drove up and there were all but 5 cars parked there, we even wondered if it was open.  We (me and the family) was seated. We ordered the entrees that came with the salad bar. Every single salad item tasted old. Our entrees finally came, and we were all very disappointed, the burgers my daughters ordered were mushy, the bun covered in grease, the burger no flavor. My wife ordered fish tacos, it was mediocre. I ordered the crab cake entree, it was literally two very small cakes of what appeared to be food. It had mushy wet mixture of stuffing and mayonnaise, it was extremely undercooked. I had to separate the mush from the actual pieces of crab, or what was supposed to be crab, then left the wet mush left. The server asked if everything was ok, I told her the crab cakes were not done, she said well you seemed to eat most of it, I said \" Yes, the fish that I picked out, however I left the undercooked wet mush\" The manager came shortly after and asked if everything was okay, and before I could open my mouth she grabbed the plate of wet mush and walked away...  So...If you like gross food, and paying high a price for it, go here.... We should have gone to Culvers across the street, It would have been light years better than here...  Giving 1 Star is generous...  Never Again!...."}
{"text":"Okay let's start with the complimentary biscuits they give after taking your order. They were dry, over baked, but a pretty good flavor. I have fried shrimp dinner with crab cake and a lobster tail! HORRIBLE! The lobster was cooked too long, shrimp had an after taste like they were fried in oil that need to be changed out. The crab cake had TOO Much breading and not very flavorful. I will Not eat at this restaurant again.  Oh and the lemonade is so tart that we had to mix with water just to drink it....SOOOO from the drinks, dinner and biscuits, dinner was horrible! Only decent thing there was the salad....I could've gone to Wendy's for a Great salad and spent way less than $50!"}
{"text":"I never rate a restaurant this low unless there is something seriously wrong with it, and that usually means something unsanitary about it, which is the case with this restaurant.  After having ordered the shrimp pasta it came served to our table in a  huge all white plate with (3) not one or two but (3) finger prints INSIDE the plate area, the area where my food was. I obviously told them I was not eating the food, that it was unsanitary and that they should take it back. Then when the general manager came over to our table, he told me that this was not their standard, but however that type of thing does happen occasionally while the chefs are handling the food. REALLY? Their chefs HANDLE the food!!! I would like to know why a chef has to stick his hands into a pasta plate once let alone three times. Can someone please explain that to me. So according to their manager, his own words, their standard for sanitation must not be too high, since again, his own words, these types of things happen. I don't get it, I understand people make mistakes, but this seemed perfectly fine with this manager, that a plate would be served with (3) finger prints inside the dish. Terrible, Terribe, Terribe, is all I can say. Oh ya, then to top it all off, I got to sit and watch my elderly uncle eat his food, my fault I guess because I had no confidence in their kitchen staff at that point and therefore turned down the managers offer of remaking my food; and then to top the whole experience off, the manager charged me for my ice tea. Did you hear that? After making my experience at their restaurant a complete and unacceptable experience (maybe they don't train their managers that they are selling not only food, but atmosphere and an experience) he charges me for my ice tea.  Like I said, a bad experience is one thing but when it comes to a restaurant being unsanitary, I think people need to be made aware of it."}
{"text":"Where to start! We were looking for a place to celebrate my mom's birthday and we found this place on yelp. We came in and Manny took care of us. His customer service and serving skills were exceptional! The food was fresh and perfect! Thank you Manny for making my mother's birthday amazing and memorable!"}
{"text":"Well when you 1st walked in it smelled like rotten eggs or an overflowing toilet. We braved it and still preceeded to sit down. After being sat in the back it took 10 min for our drink order to appear  (it's not busy) and after that when the food came it was either not cooked properly or a small amount. The one at Tempe Market Place is AWESOME, now we know to just make the 15 min drive and get great service and food."}
{"text":"Service was friendly but I am giving this only 2 stars because the food is way over priced for the quality of food you get. They need a price make over. I ordered chicken tenders and fries for $10. I got three tiny little strips hardly enough for a child and about 10 fries. This meal was only worthy for $5 at the most. My mom ordered a $17 chicken meal that was dried out and miniature also. We basically wasted our money and won't be back."}
{"text":"it's a chain restaurant with a salad bar.  the salad bar happens to be my favorite thing about this place and in my mind, it's only redeeming quality.    their burgers and fries/entree items are just ok.  i'm still upset that they no longer have the crab cake \"burger\", THAT i really liked.  service is usually good, sometimes creepy."}
{"text":"This place is a hot mess now. I used to come here about 5 years ago but it seems the service and food is continually getting worse. The waiter was extremely slow and inattentive. We ordered the rib & chicken tenders special and the chicken was not done and had to be sent back. They don't automatically give you extra BBQ sauce either for the ribs that had no sauce on them...not coming here again..."}
{"text":"We have been coming for years. We know the staff and love that they know us. Never had an issue asking for a table in 'our spot'.   Food is always the same. Maybe because it's pre made. It's along the lines of Applebee's food. Nothing is made in house im sure.   The reason we keep coming back is the salad bar. It is always super fresh, and always super clean. I love a good salad bar."}
{"text":"Spaghetti squash marinara 260 cals and doesn't taste like it!  Completely love this place!  Husband and I have been avoiding this place for years because it was always unhealthy with mostly fried choices.  We decided to be a little bit bad one day and went in to share something.  What a pleasant surprise to find they had some really great healthy choices and the calories listed right there on the menu so you dont have to guess or feel annoying by having to ask.  My husband got the spaghetti squash which I never had before and would never in a million years choose myself in fact the 260 calories listed made me turn my nose up thinking yuck that will be tasteless.  I got some whiskey or something flavored chicken cant remember with garlic mashed cauliflower which was a little over 300 calories.  Mine was amazing, tasty, and healthy and the whole time I was eating it I wished I had ordered that spaghetti squash cuz it was even better than mine!  Love it and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious. This location is near my work, so it ends up being our default sometimes, this is not a bad thing. We took a coworker here for her birthday, when we mentioned to the waitress we had a birthday she told us they don't sing-that was a bummer. One of the negatives is the food always takes so long to get to our table. We waited a good 30 minutes (or more) before anyone saw any food. Normally this wouldn't be an issue, but we were on our lunch break."}
{"text":"This was good the first two times I went but now it's just okay. Even when I asked for no seasoning on the steak there was still a peppery taste to it. My friend ordered the tricoastal which was tilapia, shrimp, and lobster tail. She got a good portion of tilapia but the lobster tail was small and there was only three shrimp."}
{"text":"this another place that i would give no stars to if possible.  it's been on the corner of mill and university for as long as i can remember, which is impressive since nothing older than ten years has been able to withstand the rent increases, and even more impressive because i don't know a single person who goes there.  i went in there one time, for drinks and walked past one of the foulest salad bars I've ever seen. for some reason, it's right by the door. instead of walking in to see a hostess stand you walk right into this brown mess of vegetables.  after seeing that first off, i wouldn't dream of ordering food here. the place is also dark and dirty and there's never anyone inside of it.  seriously, I'm really curious how this place survives. awesome little neighborhood wing and live music joints like long Wong's get torn down for high rise condos, yet gross, ghost town ruby Tuesdays hangs on the corner of main and main of Tempe. what is wrong with the world?"}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in a while and after tonight's mess of a meal I know why. First of all my lobster was old looking but the taste was horrible.  It not only looked like rubber it tasted like rubber.  My food was cold , crab cake small burnt and awful. What a waste of our money.  I have no ideal what happened to the establishment but they need to get it together,  I pray that I am not ill in the am. Just disgusting.  Shame on you Ruby Tuesday for selling mockery of food. It was so bad there is no star to give"}
{"text":"This was not as good as should have been.  Service was o.k. but not great.  It took too long for the server to come to the table. The server left empty dishes on the table when we were done.  The steaks we had we not great.  Both were fatty.  20.39 for a 12 oz Ribeye, really?  Way overpriced.  They did not even have a lunch menu.  The server did not tell us of any specials"}
{"text":"We crashed Ruby's w/ a Huge bday party, tons of kids... 20 ppl. Server was of top of it tho!! Buffet was good as usual but chicken sandwich was very average.  $10 for a small side and average sandwich is a bit much but the $4 add on for salad makes up for it."}
{"text":"5/22/18. Came back for b-day burger and salad bar. Tribe was on. All food was good. The server was excellent (Haylie). Background music was even cool!"}
{"text":"Placed an online order for takeout and was given the time of 9:11pm for pickup. Showed up at the Ruby Tuesday and it was confusing as to who to talk to about the online order, where to pick it up, etc.  Once we figured that out, we had to wait...and wait...and wait for our takeout food (2 salads and 1 baked potato). Why tell us that it would be ready at 9:11 when it wasn't until closer to 9:40? It absolutely seemed like they waited until we arrived and paid to start assembling the food -- which, even doing so, shouldn't have taken so long to make.   They gave us the food and, when I checked the bag, there were no plastic utensils. When I asked for them, they said they had none -- except for spoons. What?! We were staying at a hotel after a long day of driving and just wanted to take the food back to the room, eat/relax, and head to bed. The server's answer was for us to ask the hotel for the utensils. (Yes, of course the hotel had them, but how could the whole restaurant be out of plastic utensils and not even mention this, etc.?)  Food was fine/middling (I mean, it's a Ruby Tuesday) but avoid this particular restaurant, what with its atrocious service."}
{"text":"Salad bar was surprisingly good as a side item. I also got the baked mac and cheese and wished I had more when it was gone. Nice staff, clean restaurant and good food. Price isn't terrible for what you get."}
{"text":"I came here with my family and was very disappointed. There's a reason why there's never a wait time at this restaurant. We were seated really quickly which we thought was a good sign. It seems that the staff has no sort of uniform, the hostess that seated us was dressed terrible. The appetizers took forever to come. The food followed soon after but the food was subpar at best. The fried zucchini that I was excited about was burnt. I got the Bella Chicken and the mushrooms were completely burnt almost worst than the zucchini. The shrimp on the appetizer menu was terrible we had to send it back. And the waitress even left it on the bill when we didn't even eat ONE shrimp.   There's a reason that there's no lines here ever. Even the worst home cook could make food better than this. I won't be back."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came to this location several times when I first moved to Charlotte last year. We haven't come as much recently due to our schedules, but we were definitely loyal customers. I came here for lunch last Wednesday with a coworker, which was my last time. I ordered chicken tenders and substituted the side for the salad bar. After a couple of bites into my salad, I bit into something sharp. I informed the waitress about the object, and she said she would get the manager. The same waitress came back and said the meal would be comped. I was happy about the comped meal; however, the manager never even made an effort to come out and speak to us. Finding something sharp in a meal is something very serious. Because the manager never even came out to apologize, it made me feel like I was being blown off, and the manager didn't want to deal with the situation. Due to the lackluster apology and the manager never even coming out to handle the situation, I will not return to this Ruby Tuesday."}
{"text":"We went by there tonight, and it was CLOSED!, so sad after 10 years in Summerlin, they are gone."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious but the service is terrible. The manager was nice but our servers are always bad, bringing the wrong food, messing up orders, taking forever to bring simple things like water or some extra condiment, disappearing and not returning...she didn't even bring our check to the table even after we told her we were running late. The coffee was always old or cold. We ordered coffee and it was first very old so we asked for fresh HOT coffee and said no problem but we waited and waited then finally when she brought the coffee it was cold. Yes it was fresh but how why was it cold? The manager didn't charge us for it and he was very apologetic but I don't think I'll be eating at this location for a while."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience ever!!!! The management (Stephanie) at this location was probably the worst that I ever seen. The way that she treated me and my family was a disgrace to the Ruby Tuesday corporation. We arrived at the restaurant at 10:45 and we were a party of 10. She made it perfectly clear with her looks, body language and words that she was not happy that we came in at 10:45pm. The restaurant does not close until 11pm; which means that the kitchen was still open. The manager (Stephanie) told us that we had five minutes to order because the kitchen was closing. And to add insult to injury she said it with a nasty attitude and then walked away. Thank goodness for the waitress (Josie) because she was kind and very accommodating. She was a rock star! The manager never helped her or came over to our table one time to check on us, BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Drury next door and thought it would be convenient to go here and eat. BIG BIG MISTAKE!! When we walked in we noticed that most of the employees were sitting at the end of the bar. After a few minutes the hostess came over and seated us. She asked if we wanted to sit in the bar area? I said no. They want you to sit there so they don't have to go far to wait on you. And so they can sit down on the job. The salad bar looked like it hadn't been clean or straighten up in a long time. No one there wants to work nor cares about making money. We waited over 10 minutes and no one came to take our drink order or food order. There was this one girl who had tons of ear rings walk buy a few times but she never spoke to us. I assume she was a waitress. Hard to tell though because they don't wear name tags or uniforms. We ended up leaving and going to O'charley's. It was there we were greeted with friendly service and a smile. We had a good server and good time. So if you want good food and good service, go to O'charley's!!!trust me you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"I don't expect high standards at a Ruby Tuesday but the experience was horrible. Our waitress took away our appetizer without asking and before we could stop her and we weren't done, still had 3 shrimp left from the overly priced $10 appetizer that had maybe 10 shrimp to begin with and didn't even get to eat them all. We were out of water after that and she asked if we wanted refills but never returned with them. Eventually another waiter asked if we needed refills, to which we replied yes. Didn't see him for a few minutes when a third waiter approached and asked if we needed refills, all the while we had no idea where our waitress went. The second waiter finally brought waters. Our waitress brought our food out a good half hour after we ordered and it was by no means busy. My boyfriend's chicken was luke warm.   To be perfectly honest, if I were the type to \"dine and dash\" I would've done so here. I obviously didn't, but my tip reflected the very poor service and sub par food. I don't think I'll ever end up at a Ruby Tuesday again, this one or any other."}
{"text":"I have gone to this place many times for I am pretty local.  I never had a bad experience here.  Yes, it is a chain but that is just irrelevant in writing a review. Our last visit was on Sept. 15 2012.  We were greeted and seated with a happy manager and staff.  Having a pleasant staff is half the battle when it comes to restaurants.  The atmosphere was comfortable and the place was clean. We order drinks and a shrimp fondue appetizer, which came prompt and tasted good.  We had an encounter with the manager whose name was Doug, I believe.   Great guy and was not afraid to get involved with helping his staff.  A lot of these places you can't really tell who the management is but it was apparent he was in charge and ready to help where needed.  The salad bar now is offered as a side with entree and was fresh and stocked.  I usually don't do salad bars but it was a special treat.  My wife ordered steak and lobster which she enjoyed.  Every time I go to Ruby's I get pretty much the same thing, Asian Glazed Salmon.  This has to be the best dish on their menu in my opinion.  The dish is consistently great and I highly recommend trying this dish.  After entrees I wrapped the evening up with a Blonde brownie with ice cream, which was awesome.  I will definitely go back and I can safely say I will  always get the same treatment that I have spoke of in this review.  Remember I do realize it is a chain, but all chains do not have the same people.  It takes managers and staff who care about their job and want to make the experience great for you.  The food will then follow."}
{"text":"The food blend and the service was trouble."}
{"text":"First of all, I had the salad bar and it was good but I was not offered biscuits. I seen some food come out of the kitchen and it looked good, BUT! I was there for early lunch at 11:00 when they open. I sat at the bar and noticed the cooks in the kitchen eating, while doing prep work. The waiters and waitresses were standing in front of the cooks station, where they keep the plates and get handed food through the cooks window. They were still getting ready for their shift, this involved the flipping of hair and brushing of hair to make their ponytails, putting on lipstick all done in front of the cooking area. Plus the finger eating of the staff and NOT washing their hands before they start serving food. Even noticed one waitress finger eating out of the garnish tray that is for bar drinks. She kept putting her fingers in the garnish tray and sticking this into her mouth and reaching for more, now she is going to serve your food!? DISGUSTING! She seen me looking at her but it did not seem to phase her. I have never seen such a laid back environment in the food service industry in my life. Lots and lots of standing around talking and eating with fingers. Now I understand it is the beginning of the day shift but there is ALWAYS things to be done in a restaurant, ALWAYS! And this much standing around joking and eating and getting ready for work is unacceptable if I were running this establishment. These people need to get ready for work at HOME! So when they walk through the door all they need to do is put on an apron and WASH their hands and go to work. These people are in the FOOD SERVICE INDUSTRY, they need to be trained as such! I will not be back."}
{"text":"I've had numerous wonderful meals at this Ruby Tuesday.  Great food and there are usually coupons to be found."}
{"text":"First time here and really wasn't sure what to expect. However, walking in and past the garden bar perked me up! I ordered a 6oz steak and garden bar, while my family ordered a \"grown up\" burger, chicken sandwich, and half baby back ribs. Every. Plate. Eaten clean!"}
{"text":"Small And outdated TVs place seems to have gone down hill as place seems to be not as clean as it used to be.  Service ok."}
{"text":"The customer service here is horrible. I've been to this location quite a few times and this time in particular was not good. It took almost 30 mins to get fries and mini burgers? Luckily they have the salad bar because we were starving. The salad bar was alright but a lot of the food was not fresh. Probably won't be back to this location. We weren't offered dessert or anything which we would have purchased. The manager walked around and didn't speak to anyone. We walked in and he had his back to the door and didn't turn around to greet us or anything. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I had the grilled chicken and crab cake combination with a side of baked brussel sprouts with asiago cheese and the salad bar. The salad bar was, um, ok. When the waiter set my plate in front of me, it was gross to look at. I tried to eat it but couldn't. I couldn't find any crab in the crab cakes and they tasted like corn meal with nothing holding them together. Chicken was overcooked and the brussel sprouts were nasty. We noticed the manager was bringing food orders out to all the Afro-American customers and making sure they were taken care of and never offered to speak to any customers of other ethnic groups. He was of course Afro-American. As a whole customer service and food sucked. Wasted time and money there. We won't go back."}
{"text":"I was blown away by the new decor. The restaurant looks amazing! The food is always great. Our waiter, Kassid was very attentive and quite pleasant.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Ruby Tuesday in years. They may need to rebrand themselves.The service was wonderful. I had a quesadilla and it was fabulous. My daughter had a sloppy burger that she said was delicious.  The drink menu had a wide variety of drinks that sparked my interest.  I can't wait to go back and try some drinks and dessert."}
{"text":"We usually have a great meal, this time the waiter was rude dint even listen to the order.  I actually had the burger with endless fries and was never even asked if I wanted a refill of fries.  Looks as if this will be our last time to be waited on by Dave.    Robert"}
{"text":"I always have a great time here.  The food is good, and the service fast.  They have a great salad buffet that includes meat."}
{"text":"Food was nothing to write home about. Had a rude waitress... One with some-kind of tat behind her ear. I clearly said \"No bacon\", and she brings the meal with BACON on it. I told her I asked for no bacon, and she mumbled something about not hearing me. She tells me the cook is going to make another plate. Well, the plate comes back quickly, and of course all they did was removed it, because the chicken tasted like bacon. Gross. I was so enraged, I did not tip. Don't waste your time or money there."}
{"text":"Lunch today. Had the triple play- shrimp, chicken and ribs. Was very good. Was served promptly. No problems."}
{"text":"Food is always good here.  They have a small salad bar that always cures the need for a decent fresh salad.  We can never finish our meal so we get 2 for 1 if you make a decent salad.  Friendly and quick service."}
{"text":"I'm actually kind of torn between a two star and three star review for this place. The food wasn't great, and even with a free bday burger coupon, and free app coupon (which they graciously allowed us to stack), the total still was about $15 pre tip, although the service was really good.  This place is just like Red Robin. I wasn't really impressed with RR's burgers either, and RT's was on the same level. I just expect more for $10+ burgers. The bday coupon is for \"any burger up to $9\" though no burger is $9. They are $9.50 to $12. Thankfully you can just pay the difference. I got the bacon cheeseburger. Kind of dry, not very flavorful. We also got a chicken sandwich, and while I usually don't care for chicken, it was actually very tender and I liked it better than the burger. For our app we got the shrimp fondue, which was sooooo fattening, but it was good, though a bit on the salty side. They also offer small cheese biscuits on the house. I was hoping for Red Lobster cheddar bay biscuits, but these were much more dry and kind of sour for some reason.  Bf said the men's room was filthy, but the ladies room was fine. Our server was very friendly and quick, even though it was a little busy with the lunch rush on a Sunday, and she had a large bday party in her section as well. Ah hell with it. I'll knock it up to 3 star for our server."}
{"text":"We have been here a couple of times now and each time has been a good experience.  My husband has tried a few burgers and liked them ...Myself I can't get enough of their salad bar, it is nice to have such a great selection, even if just small amounts.  BUT those Croutons OH my they are Amazing, now every time I drive by I crave them!! Once we try more things on the menu I will more and likely bump it up to 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"My girl said lets go to Ruby Tuesdays and I was like huh? I mean who wants or craves Ruby Tuesday? Well we go and it was nothing to tell your friends about and it reminded me why I forgot all about the place. Food was so-so. Prices were average. Decor was okay and service was good. Lots of better choices so if Ruby Tuesday went out of biz or didn't exist I wouldn't care one bit. Ruby Tuesday=Meh..."}
{"text":"Food here was ok  Salad bar has good variety.  Service here sucks.  Salad bar was missing several items.  Several people complained and amongst the 3+ servers, they couldn't fill the missing items on a weekend at 7PM."}
{"text":"I've given this location multiple tries to get it right, but they fail each time. The moment you walk in you're instantly cold with how low they keep the AC, service is okay but each server we've had is very quiet & awkward. No joke, food has been cold literally every single visit I've been there. Manager didn't seem to care when we brought it to his attention. Their customer service sent me a certificate to give them another chance, but the code provided was apparently \"already used\" (per the staff). 2 stars because the salad bar isn't bad, but won't be returning."}
{"text":"Dining area is warm with rich wood throughout the restaurant. They have a nice large wooden bar, large dining area for larger groups.  They have ample dining areas with both booths and tables with comfy chairs. There is evens small patio for outside dining.   Service was great, prompt, courteous and personable.  She brought is a couple warm cheese biscuits, need I say more.  Right after we placed our order she surprised us with a few more. The asiago sirloin was wonderfully prepared accompanied with a baked potato and a well stocked salad bar.  Loved it.  Friend enjoyed the coconut shrimp and sirloin. They have a nice bar menu.   The deserts looked heavenly. Crowd was a combination of travelers(near airport), business and locals.  I will be back."}
{"text":"It was our first time at a Ruby Tuesday's and it won't be our last. The service was great. We really enjoyed our bbq chicken flatbread and the burgers were great. I had a margarita that tasted wonderful. The atmosphere was delightful."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst restaurant I have eaten at. It took at least 50 minutes to get my food. I was supposed to get complimentary biscuits...the waitress brought 3 tea biscuits. I ordered the \"great salad bar...there was little to nothing there edible.\" The food, when it finally came, tasted dry and seasonless. To top it off, I was charged twice on my credit card. Oh, I forget to mention the spider web hanging from the table by where I was sitting. Worst EVER!!!!!"}
{"text":"A bit disappointed with this location of Ruby Tuesdays. We had a group of 12 people and even called ahead for a reservation. When we arrived at the restaurant, we come to find that they couldn't accommodate our large group. We were seated at three separate tables to our surprise. The service was okay... Our server was a little overwhelming at first, but when we actually needed him, he pulled a disappearing act and was nowhere to be found. I waited at least 15-20 minutes just to close out my tab.  I can't speak for the food as I only ordered drinks, but a few coworkers who did order food didn't have any complaints. And from the looks of it, the food looked great.  I probably won't be coming back here for awhile as I'm a sucker for great service and attentiveness."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and ordered a burger with the salad bar. Burger was cooked perfectly to order and salad was good. Nothing fancy about the salad bar but it hit the spot (reason for four stars). My husband ordered a pasta dish and mother ordered the tilapia. Everything was tasty:) Service was good and manager even made his rounds to make sure everyone was happy."}
{"text":"I discovered the salad bar here a couple years ago and have visited with my family every time we have come to town. The service has always been good and the food reasonable, especially at lunch. This time for dinner, it was ten minutes to get a drink order in and ten more minutes to order. Our poor waitress was trying but had zero multitasking skills. The salad bar was fine but when the food arrived, my fries were cold and the burger was not much warmer.  Our drinks never got refilled either and the place was not slammed.    No real food complaints but the service was just awful."}
{"text":"This is our go-to place for the greatest salad bar ever! We've been to several other locations and this one is the best. friendly staff, the mini's are great, the drinks are perfect!  They come & throw out things at the salad bar that don't ever look and hour old. always the coldest, freshest here. We can't say enough about this great place."}
{"text":"Sorry, not good the table was dirty, even after requesting it to be cleaned.Alot of grease build up.  The drinking glasses were filty, food particles on the outside!  The server was excellent,!  sent back the pasta chicken so dry couldn't swallow.  The worst part was the filth. Will not be returning"}
{"text":"We came here for the very first time tonight. We have been to other Ruby Tuesday ,but first time here.  Nice Hostess,opened the door for us and then sat us in a booth.  Just one thing wrong we noticed after going to wash our hands, the place was freezing! It was only in the 50's outside and the air was on.  We had a sweet server ,Robyn. She said we can only change it 4 degreees either way. She also offered that we could move to another booth. We declinded, she turned it up and it was slightly more comfortable! Anyway, the food was good , I got the Ribs and they were fantastic! Along with baked potato and sugar snap peas, was really good.  My girlfriend got steak, shrimp and zucchini with baked potato. Steak was a little tough,but they cooked it perfect. We like Ruby Tuesday and they have kick ass coupons at times as well. So always a good place, we just do not need the air on in Dec. Ciao!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Ruby Tuesdays in a long time since I always felt the food was mediocre and never really knocked me off my feet. They are freshly renovated with a new menu and I must say the dish I had was very good. It was Crispy Chicken Mac n' Cheese and it was yummy! Cheesy and crispy, just how I like it! Their salad bar is in my opinion the best they have to offer. Will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"I will say I was disappointed with my meal. The salad was withered up, and not enough sauce. The food portion was small, I was hungry about an hour later. I was expecting much better."}
{"text":"Giving this place 5 stars because frankly, they earned it.   I'm new to the area and although Vegas is known for being a service town, it doesn't always happen once you get off the strip. I've experienced it far too often in the few months since we moved here. In both high end places and middle of the road places like this.   That is why when I come across amazing service, I like to acknowledge it.   I ordered food 20 minutes before they closed. I had to call since if you try to order online at that time, you can't. I arrived about 7 minutes before close and instead of being nasty, they were welcoming. They instructed me to go to the bar to pay and pick up my food. When I arrived there, the bartender Ashley took care of me. To say she was sweet is an understatement. She was the perfect hostess. When I informed her that it was my birthday and my son's birthday this week, she offered me a sundae!   I have been to many bars and many places like Ruby Tuesday, but rarely have I come across someone like Ashley. She says she's there all the time, so please go in and say hi!"}
{"text":"Came in after a hard day. Jessica the bartender awesome she was a great ear and bartender. Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I was a little nervous about stopping because of the previous reviews but was craving the salad bar so we gave it a shot. We had salad and the jalapeño burger was messy but very flavorful. Bathrooms were clean and service was good."}
{"text":"I live near here, I usually get it to go. They have a really great apple skillet desert. The steak is meh,  UT you get what you pay for! Everyone's really nice and it's a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love this place. I was so glad to find one in West Covina not exactly close, but a lot closer then VEgas. The burgers are always fresh, hot, and juicy. They have the best turkey burger i've ever had. Turkey can get so dry. The hot wings are better then good. The salad bar is fresh with a wide selection of salad selections. Its very reasonably priced. JOe always gets the steak which is actually pretty good. But remember its a hamburger restaurant"}
{"text":"We have come here a few times now and every time it has been really a good experience.    The food has always been excellent and the service very good as well.  Our waiter brought us lots of lemons and many refill on drinks. There is lots of very convenient parking just right outside.   Bathrooms are always nice and clean. THis is the first time we had burgers here. Turkey and beef, both were winners."}
{"text":"It's great to pick your dinner with a salad bar as a side-item. Also, their menus have a lot of options if you don't want a big meal. Overall I have been here a few times and never disappoint."}
{"text":"My family especially my youngest daughter loves Ruby Tuesday. The restaurant is clean, the employees are friendly and the food is always yummy no matter what you order!! I recommend the burgers, sandwiches and ribs!!  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Came in around 5:45 PM.  Wife had the Triple Play Meal and I had the Mix and Match Ribs.  Just had water to drink.  Forgot my camera for pictures.  Everything was excellent.  Our waitress's name was Brynn G and she did a great job.  Even had the manager come over and ask if there were any problems and if we were happy."}
{"text":"It's been years since I've had Ruby Tuesday's and when I realized there was one in the valley, I was excited to try this particular one. We arrived late on a weekday night, so there weren't many people there. We sat at the empty bar to watch TV and keep the bartender from falling asleep. The thing I remembered most about Ruby Tuesday's was their salad bar that  you could add as a side to any entree and when I walked in I was glad to see that was still the case.  I've always liked their burgers and decided to try the turkey burger this time with the salad bar option for an additional $2.99. The salad bar was clean and everything looked and tasted fresh. Since there were only a handful of tables being occupied, our food came pretty quickly. I was barely half way through with my salad when the entrees arrived. My turkey burger was extremely juicy and perfectly cooked. The only challenge was eating it along with my salad and fries.  The bartender was friendly and conversed with us the entire time (probably because he was bored). We asked if happy hour started at 9 PM and since it was 8:45 PM when we asked, he said we didn't have to wait and could order drinks if we wanted to. That was nice of him but happy hour prices are a measly $1 cheaper than the menu price! What a joke, no wonder nobody cares!  Overall the food and service was good and just what I remembered from frequenting the locations back in Illinois during my college days. I will definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"Love this place. Staff is awesome and wine is great with supreme crab cakes and dessert"}
{"text":"Excellent service, great food - we would highly recommend it will be Tuesday to others."}
{"text":"I've only been to a Ruby Tuesday once in my life and that was in Upstate New York. Yesterday I needed to eat somewhere close to my work and this was the closest option.  To start, when I walked in the door the first thing the host said was, \"Who are you?\" I have been hosting and working in a restaurant since I was 16 and I've never ever said that to someone. It was really rude.  My buddy was sitting at the bar so I went to sit with him (insert evil glare from the hostess here). They had the Red Sox game on so I couldn't really complain. The server was good, but I noticed she was doing her homework behind the bar. I needed water a couple of times and didn't get it because she was distracted. I know how these businesses run and I would never allow my employee to do their homework where someone could see, or at all for that matter.  Food was good. I had the chicken fresco with mac and cheese and a salad. The salad was disgusting and wilted but the rest of the food was pretty tasty.  A couple other things I disliked about my experience here: they were cleaning the restaurant in front of the customers. I don't mean just cleaning the dirty tables, but getting on their hands and knees and scrubbing parts of the restaurant. I nearly knocked a guy over walking out of the restroom. I realize they were slow but it turned me off a bit. Also, the other employees were talking about tables right in front of me. They could have refrained from that and filled my water that was empty right in front of me. They were also eating right in front of me which I find unsanitary and unprofessional.  In a nutshell, the food was this place's only saving grace, but I am not going to go running back anytime soon. They are a little better than Applebee's but not much."}
{"text":"I ordered the lunch salad bar/slider special. The sliders were very salty and the meat, though requested med-rare, was cooked well done. I also did not notice while reading the menu that the burgers were topped with bell pepper (which I learned too late--I am highly sensitive to bell pepper and my stomach 'rejected' them later)."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and had Valentine Day Special. It actually was pretty good, bourbon chicken, baked potato, salad bar, and dessert. I guess the only thing really to complain about was salad bar. We moved here from Aurora, Colorado, and the salad bar at Ruby Tuesday was the very best, always kept clean and refilled with everything you would ever want. The one at this restaurant has very little, no one came by to check it or replace anything. I would think quite a few people eat there for the salad bar as there are not many places to choose from that have one. Many of the choices for salad toppings were already gone and we ate there early. Many came through after us and sitting nearby did not see anyone clean or replenish anything. We don't come to this one often because of that. It's never very busy for lunch, I hope it does much better for dinner. We had a great server today, she was helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Chain me up!  Having recently been forced to go gluten-free, I've had to revisit the whole concept of eating at chain restaurants.  In turn, I've visited this Ruby Tuesday on a number of occasions.    THE UP-SIDE:  Super-friendly service, enough room to spread out, and lighting that is easy on the noggin.  With an excellent salad bar that stretches a good 15 feet, there is always a quality fallback plan for those eating healthy and/or having to go gluten/free.  For those not worried about gluten, the food is pretty damn good for a chain.  THE DOWN-SIDE:  This place goes out of its way to note that they have a gluten-free menu - they don't.  What they have is a long, xeroxed list of things to avoid on their regular menu.  While this is definitely helpful, it would be far more helpful if they just had straight-out gluten-free offerings.  Trying to hold up their regular menu and go between it and the xeroxed list is annoying and far too much trouble.  THE SUM-IT-UP:  While I do wish this place would offer true and distinct gluten-free offerings, the salad bar does help fill that void.  People not worried about going gluten-free will enjoy this location no problem."}
{"text":"Relaxing! Great service, personable manager! Food was perfect! Comfortable experience for an out of town single female! Will be back."}
{"text":"Very bad. The salad bar used to be one of their strengths. They've cut back on the number of items offered. I tried one of the few items on the menu that listed calories (BBQ chicken with one side). Sauce was cloyingly sweet. The side I chose was creamy mashed cauliflower. It was little better than baby food. The plating was absurd as well: these two items alone on a plate - little islands of yuck on a sea of porcelain. Will not return to this or any other Ruby Tuesday."}
{"text":"I like Ruby Tuesday.  It's a chain yes, but I love their salad bar!  Usually when I go, I am by myself and the staff usually lets me keep to myself.  They don't bother me to the point of annoyance but they always check up on me.  All of the people are very friendly and as long as they keep the salad bar up and the staff happy, then I don't really see any problems.  (Except they've taken the crab cake burger and veggie burger off the the menu!  Those were my faves!)"}
{"text":"I'm sorry Souplantation, but I have a new favorite salad bar. Small portions of everything from burgers to sandwiches that can be accompanied by an endless salad bar for only $2 more? You can't go wrong! Everything was fresh, delicious and totally the right price. Can one please open by my house?"}
{"text":"The biscuits, the biscuits, the biscuits!! I came here to redeem my free burger with the purchase of 2 drinks coupon and to my surprise the turkey burger with swiss and mushrooms was splendid with sweet potato fries and mac n cheese......yum! I usually come here once or twice a year for the salad bar or one of their many low calorie meals, but the wonderful bartender, Joseph, introduced me to those crack biscuits........let's just say I'll probably be a regular from this day forward.........."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for lunch. First thing is the bar area seems really cramped. I didn't want to move my chair for fear of bumping into the people behind me. Service was ok. The bartender wasnt the friendliest. I dont think she said more than 2 words to me. Someone else took my order and she was nice but was just helping the bartender. The food was ok. The few things I found odd was the place smelled funky. Like dirty water or something. The staff really didnt seem to interact with the guests. Not sure if I'll return just seemed weird.... 2.5"}
{"text":"I wanted to update that the restaurant management has been concerned and hopefully they will be proactive with future service and food quality. I appreciate them reaching out."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! Filthy! All the tables were dirty, the carpet put off a smell, and the bathroom floor hasn't been properly mopped in weeks. So disappointed in how awful become."}
{"text":"Today a friend and I ate at the Ruby Tuesday's on Independence in Charlotte for lunch. Our waiter was attentive, the house wine (malbec) was good, and the food was very good.  We started with the spring rolls which were fantastic! I had the steak filet (medium as most restaurants equate medium rare with raw) and lobster tail with grilled zucchini and spaghetti squash (these were optional sides). My friend had grilled salmon with broccoli and spaghetti squash.  My steak and lobster tail were cooked perfectly and seasoned in a way that I didn't need steak sauce or butter. My friend's salmon was also cooked perfectly. So many restaurants undercook steak and overcook salmon; so I was impressed. We finished with coffee and cheesecake which were both very good. All of this came to less than $30 for each of us. This same fare would have cost twice as much elsewhere and might not have been as good. This particular Ruby Tuesday needs to give their chef a raise. The only negative is that I originally ordered the Tiramisu. After about 5 minutes the kitchen manager came out to tell me that they were out.  He also said they had 3 on Wednesday that they anticipated would last till Tuesday as they don't sell very many. After hearing that,  I was glad they were out. Tiramisu shouldn't be almost a week old before serving.  Yikes! So stay away from the Tiramisu."}
{"text":"This place is worn with no attempts at maintenance.  Wood blinds have chunks missing, privacy panels gouged. Service is slow & inattentive. Food is suspect. After looking at my plate, decided I wasn't hungry.  These folks just don't care."}
{"text":"What can I say?  This place has all the other neighborhood bar/grill chains beaten.  Their food quality is much higher and their service more professional.  If you are nearby, it's the right choice."}
{"text":"My experience at this Ruby Tuesday was good.   I was on a little lunch date and we decided to meet up at Tempe Marketplace for a bite to eat. We were looking at the list of places to eat at and decided on Ruby Tuesday. I'm glad we did. It turned out to be excellent food and service, and the prices weren't bad either.   My friend opted for a bacon cheeseburger and I went for the grilled chicken and potatoes. Washed that down with an iced tea and I was ever-so-happy with that lunch. It was really good. Our server was a nice guy as well. He kept the iced teas flowing and was a funny guy.   The atmosphere of this place is nice, albeit a bit average. I liked the new way they did the seating. It is more open and spacious now. Their dessert menu is also excellent as well. I would very much like to come back for something off the desert menu.   Al-in-all, this is a nice Ruby Tuesday location with good service with a comfortable vibe."}
{"text":"My wife an I have been here a couple of times.  The place is clean, and the food has always been good.  We always seem to have a waitress named Tasha and she is awesome.  However, there was no Tasha today.  We were greeted immediately as we came through the door.  There was no life, no enthusiasm, and no eye contact from the hostess.   She basically just grabbed menus and walked away.  Like cattle we followed.  She then pointed to a table, put menus on it, and said \"your sever will be with you\" and walked away.  Again still never once making eye contact.  Our server was not unpleasant, but really was uncharismatic and other than taking an order, bringing food, and bringing a check she was non-existent.  Every table around us was offered and brought biscuits but not us.  The best service we had was from a waitress in a different section the refilled my ice tea and my wife's soda twice.  Where was our waitress?  Not sure.  It almost seemed like she did not like us because she was on top of the couple of other tables with more guests and probably a bigger, potential tip.  The food was very good.  Overall we would eat here again, but the service today was awful.  I even had to write that on the bill.  My 3 star rating is based on the food we have eaten in the past, and if you get Tasha as a server she is awesome."}
{"text":"Adore this location. Clean, friendly and quick service. I love the salad bar, the croutons are the best. The menu is vast.   Only missing more vegan choices."}
{"text":"This restaurant has CLOSED, along with all of the other ten restaurants in Illinois.  There are now as of 7/29/2016 NO Ruby Tuesday restaurants in the state of Illinois."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Ruby Tuesday in years. I was surprised to see that they still had one out here since I heard they all closed down. I really wanted to have a salad bar with my dinner since I'm trying to eat clean now so I thought we could come for dinner one night since my boyfriend has never been here. They sat us in the bar section, in one of the booths and I can't say the service was great, but it wasn't that bad. They did come around to check on us, but I wish it would've been a little more often. The food on the other hand, was great. We had no complaints about any of the food and the salad bar had a lot of good options to make a nice filling salad. After ordering and eating from there, I realized that I would've been perfectly happy just ordering the salad bar for dinner."}
{"text":"It is what it is. I had a larger party and they provided good solid service. The food was also good and solid. No complaints but no wows either. Again, it is what it is."}
{"text":"For the service alone 5 stars. Food was great too. We weren't sure what to expect being from California we see commercials for Ruby Tuesdays and always wanted to try it, luckily there was one less than 1/2 mile from our hotel. We were seated right away, servers came to get our drink order right away too. They were training so we got extra good service from two fantastic ladies. We got there when they opened, so the truck delivering supplies was still being unloaded-we one this because one of our items from our sampler platter was out but the waitress came right over to ask if it was ok to bring the tenders a few minutes after the other items on the sampler. Sure! No problem, I appreciated the fast response in telling us. And it was worth the wait. Tenders were delicious. They give you a great meal for a decent price. I had steak and shrimp, husband had shrimp and our son had the ribs all were served warm and tasted great. We don't live anywhere near a Ruby Tuesday's but, in our next trip out we will definitely return."}
{"text":"Came here to eat during lunch hour....won't do that again....maybe. Don't get me wrong. Great place and great food. After being seated immediately however... we waited...and waited...and waited. Finally got some service. Still took close to half hour before I got my meal. Lunch time was over by then and I had to get my guest back to her job. Manager compensated by paying for entire meal...to go. Not sure if they do reservations. If they do, I recommend you do that."}
{"text":"Ruby and I have had an on again off again relationship for about 12 years now. It's been close to 3 or 5 years since our last scandalous meeting.  I like that Ruby has attempted to change her look with choices such as mashed cauliflower, and spaghetti squash. I even liked that she shows a bit extra with the calorie count on 'some' of her options. Makes choosing that much easier, although she does hide the calories on most of her selections. My thought on that one is that she likely doesn't want to scare you away by showing too much on items like her bacon, cheese, avocado, Angus burger. I can only imagine the distressed thoughts I would have had if I had seen the truth before ordering the meatloaf. Thanks Ruby for making it easy to splurge this time. ;-)  Apparently, about a 1/3 of Ruby's gastronomic repertoire now comes with her salad bar at no added cost, and my choice of meatloaf just happened to be one of those as well as the wife's grilled chicken. It turned out to be one of those surreal moments for me. I was excited to get a seemingly free bonus, but at the same time would THIS be the day I break the no buffet style dining promise I made to myself and the wife on that fateful day back in aught nine?  Unluckily for me, Ruby had left a little something extra mixed in with her 'mixed greens' that day. Who knows, maybe it was Ruby, maybe it was one of her ladies in waiting, or maybe it was just a random customer with a 10 inch locks. Either way, I was fully unappetized after serving myself some salad with a side of dark brown hair.   Maybe I should have jumped ship at this point, but how was I to know it wasn't going to get much better? The food was average at best, and the wait staff didn't seem overly apologetic about the added locks of love incident. In fact, the first waitress I showed this to didn't even take the plate from me, I had to hand it to the bartender behind the bar myself before I could get rid of it.  The meat loaf was 'mehh, whatever' and the grilled BBQ chicken wasn't any better. The only saving grace here was the cauliflower and spaghetti squash; but truly, those are dishes that can be made easily with a few minutes of prep work at home. Needless to say, I didn't walk away from this meal with a happy ending.   Sorry Ruby, but our on and off again relationship is officially off, but never again. Your services will no longer be traded for my hard earned cash."}
{"text":"I had the double chicken. Absolutely fantastic. Cook well and a great taste. I was disappointed that there was no gravy for the mashed potatoes until I tasted them. They didn't need anything added. We tried the deviled eggs with bacon, they were pretty bland and not much to them but the rest of the meal was fantastic. The service was great as well."}
{"text":"Ruby Tuesdays has fallen on hard times a least this location. The wait staff  will argue with you if you don't like some thing yelling at you it must be your fault. The too hot for me chicken tortilla soup was mild at best and really bad.  Do not recommend this location to anyone I will eat at ruby Tuesdays again but never ever here"}
{"text":"The service was very slow. My youngest daughters shrimp and grapes came out 8 to 10 minutes after we ordered but my food wasn't there 25 minutes later so when the waiter decided to come over and tell us that the food should be out shortly I asked that they just box it up because at that point my daughter had finished her food and there was no need to sit there any longer. When the food came out the waiter brought  it out with no bag and advised that he would go get one but never came back so I left."}
{"text":"The food is always good but usually have some issue with the order. Prices are good as well. They need to bring the ORIGINAL cheese fries back onto the appetizer menu."}
{"text":"OK so it's been a while since I've been to Ruby Tuesday's went In after a movie and we ordered drinks and I saw the pork chop that they had it was a chewy gritty tasteless mess. We asked waitress for more drinks 15 minutes later we end up getting up and going to the bar and getting our own drinks the place was not busy it was a ghost town. I quickly saw why the delay on service was happening she was too busy flirting with the other waiter in the blue shirt so based upon the food in the service Ruby Tuesday's got there last chance"}
{"text":"I come here when I wanna chilled out environment.  Did the wonderful salad bar, and the spicy shrimp appetizer.  Live the clientele here..  but the Desert, Yassss!"}
{"text":"We had Hickory mountain chicken and the  big dipper sampler to share.  The entrees were average and the portion size was good.  We were there at the busy lunch hour and couldn't have asked for better service.  The real test of a restaurant's service is what happens when a mistake is made.  We had a minor mistake on our order and the staff corrected it immediately.  I had heard from a friend they had a spectacular salad bar.  The salad bar food was all fresh, but I can't say that it was anything special.  I felt it was a little pricy for a business luncheon.  I don't mean to sound negative, but it was a typical chain restaurant."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants, but the last two times have really disappointed us. The salad bar is still pretty good, however, the slider burgers came on a very stale bun, couldn't eat it and it wasn't taken off the bill. The second time, the burger was charcoal and not able to eat. I don't think you should have to pay for inedible food. Even if they still wanted to charge for the salad, I think adjustment to the bill was in order. It is now off our list of restaurants that we go to."}
{"text":"service was the worst, the food was under cooked and waited 45 min just for a burger. Do your self a favor stay away. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"First time to a Ruby Tuesday and more than likely I won't be be back. We were not allowed to have a booth since we're using a high chair. The booth next to us was by a wall, nobody would need to walk through. The whole atmosphere was unappealing, like factory work, doing the same thing day in day out. The customers next to us were extremely rude, making comments about the couple at the table next to us. I know the customers are not the restaurants fault, but if that is what the dark restaurant attracts I'd rather just go to Culver's. My food was only half hot, was probably sitting under a heat lamp for awhile, the chicken strips were over the top salty. I didn't want to say anything to the waiter since he was already getting hassled by another customer that thought they were getting more for their money. I used the bathroom, the floor was completely sticky. The baby changing station should be in a separate room or in a stall, it's too close to the door. I didn't use the stalls, but they were filthy."}
{"text":"I go to Ruby Tuesday's a lot.  It is a good and nice place for a convenient lunch -- either with business associates or with friends.  Yesterday, I had lunch with a friend here again and we both had the mini-turkey sliders and the salad bar.  The sliders were good and tasty.  The salad bar is pretty much the same, but there are some changes that are bad IMO.  They used to have chopped ham on the salad bar as a condiment, but now they replaced it with chopped bologna -- WTH?  Pretty gross, if you ask me.  The dressings are runny and watery now - not rich and thick as I like them.  And they took the tuna salad off the bar too!  So all-in-all, this place is still OK for the price, but the salad bar is going downhill."}
{"text":"This is pur first time ever at Ruby Tuesday and me and my boyfriend both got the triple prime bacon cheddar burger and this meat is sooooo fresh! My daughter got the grilled chicken from the kids menu and it is so tender and juicy I almost ate it all lol. I also got the Ruby Relaxer cocktail and it was delicious and just the right amount of alcohol. We highly recommend this place and will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Came here today for a work lunch.  It was pretty busy and they seemed to be handling it rather well.  I ordered the new Spicy Fish Tacos and the build your own salad.  The tacos where't anywhere near spicy but they really weren't that bad.  I was more than a little disappointed with the salad bar.    The stand out item from my visit today was the Pom Tea, maybe because I'm sucker for all things pomegranate and tea but I was very happy with my beverage."}
{"text":"First of all I have to say this service is a little slow but it could be due to the chef. Well worth the wait. The salad bar is amazing. They have a cilantro lime dressing that is excellent. And if you're purchasing a meal you can add on the salad bar as one of your sides for $1.99. I had what was called double Dekker chickening was  really good. So far as I have seen in the evening they only have one server working the whole room ,so if you can go earlier in the day. The restaurant, parking lot ,And restrooms were all clean. Our server was with very nice and courteous. They do have some amazing summer specials going on. This is a restaurant I would recommend but I would also recommend. Don't forget to text the number and Join get connected so you get free stuff on your birthday"}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday around 12:30PM.  Place was fairly empty, but maybe that's not so unusual mid-week.  My daughter chose to get a salad.  She said the food on the salad bar did not seem fresh.  She also got mashed potatoes, which tasted like they came from a box.  I ordered one of their \"suped up\" cheeseburgers.  What I got was a plain hamburger, not even a slice of cheese.  The server adjusted our bill to reflect what I received and she comped my beverage for the error with my order.  Service was okay.  Food was below average.  My daughter and I both believe we've made our last trip to RT."}
{"text":"Our server Abdoola was great! I don't usually complain but there seems to be a history of this same thing in the Yelp reviews. I wish I saw the reviews first. The food came out overcooked, the veggies were slimey and the when it was brought to the attention of the manager on duty, she had more of an issue that the server didn't charge for the veggies (which were a replacement for fries) than the issue that the food was overcooked, the avocado was really hard and the asparagus was cooked incorrectly. We are staying at the Hampton Inn and Suites here. The manager offered $3 off the meal but didn't offer to bring out fresh food. We gave that $3 to the waiter. He did a good job. I would not recommend this location to anyone. That is sad because we have had good food at other Ruby Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"Good was very gross. It took about 30 minutes for us to get our food and then it comes out and my children's corn dogs were greasy and not cooked. I ordered a $20 dollar steak that looked dead and the mushrooms on top were burnt. My wife's pasta sat in the window so long it was dry and gross. My bill was 52 dollars and we barely ate anything because food was so bad."}
{"text":"Food here is pretty good, but the service is excellent!! Each time I come to this location every single person who works there that I come in contact with is exceedingly friendly and helpful. I've never had to wait long for service, even on my last visit when they were offering 45% off the cost of your entire meal and it was VERY crowded. I still had servers who were attentive and friendly. As for the food, it is very good. I usually get their chicken and broccoli pasta. There is plenty of sauce, and the chicken is seasoned to perfection. On my last visit I got a regular burger with fries and an appetizer of tempura green beans. The beans were excellent! The burger was not too great. I asked for medium rare and got a burger that was rare. The only condiment offered was the ketchup that was on the table...none on the burger, so I had to ask for mayo. But, again, I got it quickly and with a smile. Their fries are boring and scanty. If I were super hungry or were a guy that had a hearty appetite I would've had to eat again once I got home (even the burger itself was small). I won't get the burger again. I got their chocolate cake to-go to enjoy later. Yummy!! I have yet to try their new salad bar but it looks delicious and will probably try that next. Oh, P.S. Their free cheddar garlic biscuits are TO DIE FOR!!!!!!!!! So good that I would list them as the one food I would want if I were stuck on a deserted island...seriously! Only wish I could purchase these by the dozen to take home."}
{"text":"The food and service here isn't the quality it used to be. We were a party of four and for the price of the entrees,  you'd expect better. I ordered the hickory chicken breast which was was a smaller than a portion you'd get at Wendy's.  Our chicken pasta came out cold which the waitress took back to the kitchen. Again, for the price you'd expect properly cooked pasta. Another order was messed up, they served a half portion of salmon and we had to wait for the rest to come out later. It was supposed to have mac and cheese with it but the waitress put in for mashed potatoes. At that point, the only saving grace was the salad bar. I won't be coming back though. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Unfortunately a real disappointment. Sat at the bar to have dinner. Service was fine, food was not. Salad bar was a plus. Food was fresh and plentiful. The house made dressings  were great. We  had the italian and French. Main course was a big letdown.veggies were cold and hard. Baked potato was old. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I liked the salad bar and the service but the other menu items just aren't our style."}
{"text":"I am severely disappointed in the treatment we received by the manager on duty, Ryan. We took my grandparents out for dinner for my grandma's birthday and we asked another patron to close the blinds at the booth they were sitting at because the light was shining in our eyes. He rudely refused and we asked the bartender to please assist us. When he did so, the other patron became belligerent and complained to Ryan. While it is unfortunate that the other patron was so upset over a simple request, we felt that as patrons ourselves, we deserve some level of respect from the manager for the situation. While the other patron was reseated, we watched as Ryan visited their table multiple times but never once approached us to address the situation. He even helped serve food to our table and did not take the initiative to be a professional manager and apologize for the situation taking place. He had multiple other opportunities to do so and did not. We also overheard him verbally reprimanding our waitress for \"handling the situation poorly\" when in fact she and the bartender did the appropriate thing by reseating the other party and apologizing to us.   After we paid our bill, I personally went to the manager to thank him for the excellent service we received from our waitress (Morgan) and the bartender and to give him one final opportunity to address the situation. When he still didn't say anything about it, I reached out to shake his hand and he refused to shake my hand. I am honestly so offended and disappointed by the treatment we received from the manager - the only thing that made our experience even the slightest bit better was the extraordinary service from our waitress and the bartender. As the only Ruby Tuesday's in Las Vegas, I hope Ryan reflects on his role as a manager and understands that he is responsible for EVERYONE'S experience, not just the individuals that complain.   Needless to say, we will NOT be visiting this establishment again and will not recommend it to our friends and family.   If you do decide to visit this establishment, ask for Morgan as a waitress or go sit at the bar- they're the BEST!"}
{"text":"My dinner date and I just had burgers and fries with the salsd bar. The burgers were juicy, no complaints on the flavor however my date ordered grilled onions which came diced on the single bun and predictably wanted to fall off. It was rather odd, which I mentioned to presumably the manager when he came around(as he didn't identify himself) and he just kind of shrugged and went on his way, unhappy I didn't say everything was wonderful.  The service wss passable. Overall, the experience was unremarkable."}
{"text":"I came here a while back for my birthday freebie and was not disappointed. I got here almost at closing but the staff didn't seem to mind and instead treated me very welcoming. I ordered the return burger with cheese and bacon along with the fries. They honored the coupon (I just had to pay the difference).not only did they honor the coupon but they also gave me a complimentary cupcake!!  The staff was super nice , specially the bar tender. She recommended a drink and j enjoyed it a lot. I will definitely be back because I felt super great with the staff and the food was very good."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this location in a few years, but I was happy with this experience.  The ambiance is nice, the staff was very attentive and the menu was good.  I do miss the Peppercorn Chicken Caesar salad they used to have, though."}
{"text":"I went on a dinner date a couple nights ago. Ribs were fork tender, and fall-off-the-bone, fried shrimp was average. But I was actually impressed with the quality of the dinner food. For lunch, the selections are so-so, and everything appealing on the menu is unhealthy. The restaurant is also dated inside, and the tables were sticky. However, besides the surprisingly good quality of the food that night, there was one other redeeming factor: our server. Im not sure what his name was (young, eager white guy), but he was honestly one of the best Ive ever had, and he made the experience 10x better. He made a couple minor mistakes, but people like him just dont exist in the real world. He was so incredibly eager and willing to go out of his way to provide excellent service. What made the difference is you could tell he was actually a genuinely nice, not just putting on an act to get a good tip. The 25% tip he earned was well deserved, and I hope management knows who Im talking about, and keeps him around for a while."}
{"text":"We actually had Ruby To-Go tonight. The order was fresh and ready when they said it would be. I used my free birthday burger coupon and had the Triple Prime Burger which was really good. The fries could've been a little fresher but I'll give the benefit of the doubt since they had to take the ride home first. Husband had the new Double Decker Chicken and fell in love. It's two grilled chicken breasts layered with grilled baby Bella mushrooms, bacon, Parmesan cream sauce and topped with shaved Asiago cheese. He's probably found his \"usual\".  Thank you for a nice dinner at home!"}
{"text":"So this place is my favorite place for salad bar take-out. Honestly, I have not sat down at this restaurant for years, but when I want a giant salad (with those to die for pumpernickel croutons), this is where I head. You do have to pay for the while entree so it's about 10 bux but that means you can load up on as much as you can fit in the box! Fresh veggies, pasta salad, potato salad and usually fruit salad. I do recall that the last time I went there NOT for a salad, I got fish and the cauliflower mash and that was delish."}
{"text":"Waitress was nice , I ordered Mac n cheese and they didn't have it so I ordered the Bourbon chicken . My mash potatoes were cold and defiantly. From a box, the desert we got was freezer. Burnt"}
{"text":"Everything from the perfect service to the wonderful steaks we had warranted 5 stars.  Great onion rings and crisp-tender green beans accompanied.  We ate outside and the evening breeze was very comfortable."}
{"text":"Came here to use a gift card from Christmas!  I was glad to try this place!  I ordered the Double Decker Chicken.   The chicken was seasoned and grilled to perfection then topped with bacon, Swiss cheese and mushrooms.  I decided on the broccoli and salad for my sides (trying to transition to a healthy start to the new year).  . The boys (hubby and kiddo) opted for the Ruby's Classic Burger.  This was a healthy size burger  sided with a large order of fries.  While food was excellent, service on the other hand could a little work.  Trying to grab our waitress's attention just to get a glass of water was like pulling teeth not to mention there were absolutely no eye contact or acknowledgement as we left the restaurant when we were done.  Other than that everything else was good.  I would have given a five star if it wasn't for the lack of customer service."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Wednesday around 13:00. Our booth was dirty. There was food on the seats, table edges and wall.   Service was adequate, only had to ask twice for tea and water refills.   I ordered the shrimp and grits. The description was shrimp, sausage and peppers in a cream sauce over creamy grits. Well...what was not mentioned was the overwhelming amount of raw onions added to the sauce. The grits were dry and caked to the bowl. Shrimp was overcooked and only sausage I found were two small slivers about the diameter of a nickel.   The salad bar was not well stocked with duplicate items to make the choices appear plentiful...  We are both from Knoxville, Tennessee and attended UT...so we are used to the high standards that Ruby Tuesday usually demands and we've experienced all over the country.   This location is the exception.   NOT RECOMMENDED"}
{"text":"First of all the address on here is all jacked up and the map thing puts the location somewhere in Chandler.  This made it difficult to check in which pissed me off.  Anyway, I made the correction on the edit business page so lets see if Yelp makes the update.  Anyway, I don't really like places like this so I wasn't excited to eat here.  I'm just not a fan of the whole cookie cutter chain thing where everything comes from a frozen package and warmed up in the microwave.  However, to my surprise, this place is pretty solid even if everything comes frozen.  I sat at the bar with a few friends to have lunch.  I ordered the sliders and they were surprisingly very good.  At like 10 bucks for 2 sliders they are a rip off but not too shabby.  I had the buffalo ones and I also tried the zucchini ones which were excellent.  The salad bar was also very good and at $1 more it was a bargain.  Everything on the bar was fresh and clean.  Oh and the 50 cent wine tasting was great.  We had to do it if only for the novelty.  The wine is only ok but who can argue at 50 cents?  Our bartender / waitress was excellent and friendly.  Am I going to rush back?  No.  But if I am in the area and am craving a salad and a burger, yes, I would be back."}
{"text":"Pretzel burger with portobello mushrooms and onion straws! I ordered broccoli as my side. It was prepared perfectly! Our server was attentive and very friendly. I mentioned it was my birthday and she brought me a cute and yummy cupcake!"}
{"text":"If you want to experience a rude environment and customer service, than this is the place to go. We had the worst server names Kassidy who was very disrespectful and degrading to myself and my Friends.  We had to wait 30 minutes for our drinks and then our orders were messed up. I had ordered a loaded back potato instead of fries but got French fries. When I asked for my potatoes it was as if I was asking for a whole new meal. My friend asked for some ranch for her fries.  Kassidy delivered my potato with just butter and sour cream and forgot my friends ranch. I asked if the loaded potato came with bacon and cheese to which she explained she didn't realize I had ordered it that way.   I was then asked if I really wanted the fixings for the potato and my friend if she wanted her ranch. She never brought out my baked potato additions but I was still charged for the food. When I mentioned it she said well you didn't want it.  She then threw away my friends food he had asked for a box for a few minutes earlier. We had asked for a manager 2 times and waited about 30 minutes.   When the manager failed to arrive we mentioned her behavior about our experience and she replied that she wasn't rude the whole time. She also stated that it would be a while before her manager could come.  Luckily the manager, Evelyn was very considerate and was able to make our experience a little better but we will never go back especially if Kassidy is working."}
{"text":"I might have enjoyed my meal with my family but two annoying flies kept buzzing around our food and our head. If I  had been outdoors l could have walked away but to be indoors is unacceptable.  I complained to the manager and he apologized but really get to the root of the problem because it was not  a nice experience. I will not go back."}
{"text":"My server Steven was so cute and funny I could hardly finish my meaL. He was good. Got the ribs and they was good. Will come back again soon."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of chain restaurants, but my daughter and I were in the area, it was late and didn't feel like driving around.  We stopped  here on a Saturday night at around 8:00.  The restaurant was busy, but we were seated right away.  The hostess was not particularly friendly, but oh well.   Our server warmly greeted us, right away and took our drink orders.  We ordered white and red sangrias (both were priced at $5 each....what a deal!!). We also placed our dinner orders.  Skewered Grilled shrimp which included the salad bar and a side dish.   I was dreading the salad bar, thinking that it was late and the bar would be messy and options would be few.  To my surprise, it was exactly the opposite.  There were FOUR lettuce options and each subsequent option was fresh and filled to overflowing.  Great choices such as edamame, fruit, chopped eggs etc.  Our food arrived shortly after we finished our salads.  Once again, pleasantly surprised...all was fresh and delicious.  I did have to request bread.  I would not have known that bread was available except for on a previous visit at a different location, I was served the most heavenly drop biscuits.  No sooner than I requested bread, the hostess returned with 4 of these mini delights, so not sure if she forgot or if they are only available on request.  I also ordered a slice of pumpkin spice cheesecake to-go.   I ate it later that night and it was AWESOME especially for $3.99.  I've had desserts that cost twice as much and didn't taste half as good. All in all this was a pretty decent meal.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Every once in a while I crave Ruby Tuesday's salad bar - not sure why as I am not a fan of anything that requires a sneeze-guard, so I get there early before grubby paws line up.  Conveniently located just off of 77 on Arrowood, you can quickly get in and out of the place if needed.    I arrived right at 11:30 to a basically empty restaurant.  The friendly hostess asked if I wanted to sit at the bar, I said that was fine as long as it wasn't bar stool seating. I was seated in a booth at the back of the bar that was right next to the effin' server/take out door.  I was professionally dressed and took a shower, so I don't know why I was relegated to seating hell.  There's a glass door, so I was blinded by the light (wrapped up like a deuce...), the young lady that was waiting on me attempted to pull the rickety shade down to block the sunlight, but then the manager took care of it.  Which solved the light problem, but every time the door was opened (8 times while I was sitting there), I got a shot of the sun and a gust of wind that blew everything not weighted down on my table around.  The seating... sucked.  But the booth was comfy.    The salad bar today was meh.  The greens (they have spinach, an iceberg mix, a springier greens mix and then a mix of everything) were looking a little ragged.  There was a lot of the tough white part of the iceberg lettuce in the mix.  Peas and ham were sitting on a liquid of some sort that wasn't terribly appetizing.  But, there is a huge selection of items on the bar, and typically they replenish it pretty frequently.  Lettuces, cucumbers, green peppers, zucchini, tomatoes, carrots, edamame, peas, broccoli, some mayo based salads, many different kinds of dressings, bacon, croutons, diced egg, etc.  I piled up my plate and it was good - although drenching things in blue cheese dressing always makes them a little better.  Service was fine and friendly.  She brought me a couple of their garlic cheese biscuits, which are small but quite tasty.  I didn't require much attention today, but she did a good job.  $7.99 for the salad bar is a good price.  I made two trips and feel I got my money's worth."}
{"text":"I went in with really low expectations as this is a chain restaurant and left very happy.  The ambiance is higher scale then I expected and the service was very good.  They offer both low cost and higher end priced meals on the menu.  I went with the vegetarian plate including salad bar.  The salad bar was my favorite part.  I didn't care much for the cauliflower or mashed potato sides that I tried."}
{"text":"Currently sitting in ruby tuesdays.. Service started off well, until my salmon Cesar salad came out and my salmon was raw! The annoying thing was, the server actually BROUGHT it out raw.. I saw the pink meat before she even set it down.. When I asked to have it cooked through, it was brought back broken into bits and my lettuce was wilted and gross.. (Obviously it was tossed back on the flat top, which I wouldn't have minded had it not come back looking like cat food) the manager came over and was immediately apologetic, removed the plate and advised he would not be charging me for me. Our waitress came over and offered different options and apologized! Every once in awhile the back of house messes up, but the way they handled it was professional and quick! S/o to Desiree our waitress and Jesse the manager! Way to handle it."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times an I haven't been disappointed yet! The service is always outstanding and the food is always HOT and delicious! The drinks are yummy too! I have always been a fan of Ruby Tuesday since my first visit back in 2001 in Tacoma, WA! If you're looking for great food on a budget then this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Slowest, most brain dead bartender on the planet. Took him almost 15 min to get a vodka and soda. I ordered a tall, was told they only come in one size. Really?!?! When all over the menu it said 'make a large for $1'..........Btw, it wasn't busy. Didn't even give us napkins or small plates for our app. We fully intended to order entrees but didn't want to camp all night. NOT a good RT, and I go to a few."}
{"text":"DO NOT bother with this place unless you have A LOT of patience and aren't very hungry. Our \"waitress\" Bernie forgot to put in our order and after 50 minutes of her assuring us it was in it's way,  we spoke to the \"manager\" Francis. She told us our order had just been submitted 11 minutes before and that she would settle things after she got us fed. An hour and  10 minutes later  we finally got our order.  Food was descent but one of our orders was wrong (of course).  And the manager's idea of settling up was offering one free slice of cheese cake for the four of us.  Bad form \"manager\", bad form. Never again!"}
{"text":"Terrible. I ordered this to go. It was all wrong. I asked for a well done burger, first it was bright pink. I asked for no salsa on the one burger, tons of salsa. Asked for a side of ranch for the fries..NO SIDE of ranch. Eveyrthing was wrong with the order. When I called, they said, sorry and we will give you a credit and send you a gift card to use, but hung up on me before they could take my name and address. I did not call back. ??"}
{"text":"Had a great appetizers called thr big dipper it was so filling that when dinner of steak loaded bake potato fresh grilled zucchini came i couldn't even eat it..left overs are always great to have. Hubby had parmesan chicken pasta which he also really enjoyed"}
{"text":"I come here once a year to pick up my free birthday burger to go and it's good every time. I've never really eaten in the restaurant cause I always forget it's there and it's not the first place I think about. But every year I show up for my burger.  One of these days I'll have to dine in."}
{"text":"Ruby Tuesday is always good.  Probably one of the best melt-in-your-mouth rib eye steaks I've ever had was at this Ruby Tuesdays.  That was on a day when I didn't have much extra time to dwell there. Ruby Tuesday was hittin' on all cylinders that day.  Always a good visit.  Always good food. The servers are friendly and some will even play (verbally) with you.    My standard meal is the Rib Eye steak with baked potato and butter, with green beans and/or tomatos.  I think only once have I had the super salad bar.  Which it is.. super.  Always greeted in a friendly manner at the door and I think only once have I had to wait a few moments to be seated.  So good job.  Overall, this Ruby Tuesday is great.  I'd say that I ear here the most when I have a coupon arrive in email to get some sort of discount.  A meal here for two people might run anywhere between $30-45.  With a coupon, depending on which one you use/get, it might cut the meal for two down to $25-37 or so.  I will come here when I don't have a coupon/special .. just not so often as when I do.  Good place.  Recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Enjoy coming here during the week.  It's not to busy and the service is always good. I really like the salad buffet. Always fresh and so good!  We also mainly love going here for the iced tea!  Always have about four to five glasses. I would recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"2nd time visiting in the 3 years I've lived in NC.  Unfortunately the first visit was not so pleasant....so I was cautious as to return.  Today I was pleased to see new renovations in the works and a clean well attended salad bar.  The service was superb and it was very apparent the new manager was very hands on!  This the good experience.  I had the avocado Turkey burger and my husband the salad bar.  Pleased with the food as well!"}
{"text":"First visit at this location.  Restaurant nearly empty, maybe 7-8 tables occupied.  No host up front, two waiters past saying someone would be up. The people passing by seemed to be doing nothing, just passing by. As I watched one just went to co-worker and they stood in place and talked, laughed a little..  Finally someone came up and said \"Table\". Not hello, welcome.. just \"Table\".  I ordered a steak for lunch.l I ordered Medium rare (wanting medium but we know that never goes well). So even compensating for what was assumed on my part going to be a little over-cooked I STILL got well done, dried out steak. I consumed half of it; could not stomach any more, way to dry.  It took so long to get seated, and almost as long for anyone to come over and take order I could not send it back, my lunch hour was over. AND THEY ARE LOCATED 3 MINUTES FROM MY OFFICE!   The good: The salad bar was good. Lettuce fresh and large chunks. Veg. selection was good and fresh and crisp. Refreshing!  The salad bar is what earned this visit two stars and I believe that I am being generous."}
{"text":"Slow service and old bathrooms downgraded this restaurant to 1 star.   Chains start at 3 stars for me--the food and service should be good because a huge chain has spelled out every last operating detail for the establishment. In this case, the food was fine, but our waiter was quite slow, and didn't seem to understand that we were in a hurry. He brought out the wrong drink to one of us, and it took forever to get our check.   The bathrooms looked a little crummy (I've seen plenty of gas stations with nicer restrooms).   2 strikes means 2 stars down from 3, leaves this at a 1 star experience."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our dining experience at RT.   Salad bar was the best and our burgers were good too.   I cannot say enough good things about the staff. The hostess kept us up to  date on an available table, our waitress was the best, and  the manager came around to make sure we were taken care of.   After our dinner, we walked out of the restaurant and observed several employees minding a baby robin on the sidewalk (and attending to their duties).  We were very touched by this.  We told one of the employees that we would take the robin to a vet.   We went ahead and took the robin home, made a call to an emergency vet hospital in Akron and took him there for care.   A happy ending!   To summarize, we had a great experience and we will be back.  Lauren and Jim Oliver"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised family has never eaten there.  Went Tuesday when kids eat free with a adult entree.  So that was a first plus!!! When we walked in the young man was very nice and was so happy to seat us.  Our drink order was taken fast I was brought a sweeten ice tea which I didn't specify.  The waitress apologized and brought me a unsweetened I told her I didn't say anything so technically my fault.  We all ordered I got the salad bar which was really good! Kids all loved their meals,  the manager brought us the meal and my husband asked for mustard he didn't get it  and the manager came by to ask how everything was he then realized he forgot the mustard he was so sorry he comped all the kids meals not just two (we have 4 kids).  We all went in their hungry and in a bad mood and left all full and happy made our first experience great!  Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"So we went here while vacationing again because we had such a great experience last time!  Shouldn't have.  The young man who seats people was so rude argued with me regarding putting us in a booth, I have young kids and need to keep them near and not at a table so they can get up.  Service is absolutely terrible, the other young man who was our waiter was very nice but forgot my sons dinner and we had to ask someone else to get it for us. Best salad bar we've ever had for sure!  Kids meals are cheap and you get what you pay for which is fine for kids.  The food was good, but because of the lack of service it just couldn't make up for higher stars!"}
{"text":"Food is always yummy here, but the service here is a bit.. Meh. I don't really know why I was given a kids cup as I was holding an adult menu and I don't think I look 8.  Service was totally absent and didn't do anything for us"}
{"text":"I ate hear about a year ago and never haven ate here b4 , but the buisness luncheon was better than expected along with my Tilapia fish entre ' including the salad bar. 5 star lunch and service then !! I decided I should return with my wife and treat her 2 a meal and not remembering the name , but the location , I did so and had the Costal Trio , while she had the Tilapia dish I had b4 , all went well , price and service was spot on and meal(s) were 5 star again at a affordable price. Keep up the consistancy , and keep the seafood in the menu. The baby breads were EXCELENT and everything else. I will return !"}
{"text":"Ruby Tuesday is a reliable restaurant  chain with, shall we say, an uninspired menu. Nothing new here to excite the restaurant goer.  Food, just OK. Ambiance, like a Denny's but maybe a little better. Prices, not cheap nor expensive. Waitstaff, good but a little robo like.   With a little effort RT could be a 4 star if they really tried, but a few missteps and bad meals it could drop to 2 stars.   I will probably return to RT but if there are better choices I would do that too."}
{"text":"Service was poor and lunch took over an hour for two people."}
{"text":"It's basically TGIF, but whatever.  The food was great, and the bartenders were awesome.  Nice big flat screens to watch Monday Night Football was a huge plus.  The flat scrizzies alone added an extra star."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of corporate chain-food BUT.....I make an exception for This Ruby Tuesday location.  Several experiences - both Lunch and Dinner.  With a group and just with the Spousal Unit.  Always Always Good.  Clean, Fresh faced, Friendly staff with good manners.  Where do they find so many healthy, happy young people to work for them?  GOOD MENU - clam chowder YES. crab cakes OH YES. Grilled zuchini YES. Baked Tilapia RIGHT ON. Salad Bar has edamame among other things so YES. Solid burger offerings - both beef & turikey TASTY.  Nice plate presentation, interesting food combinations without being pretentious.    So we pretent we don't know its a chain and its owned by some good old gal named RUBY and we keep going back!"}
{"text":"Salad bar looked like it has been sitting there for hours especially the potato salad. Food let's just say... Not coming back to this one."}
{"text":"Four for dinner and we had coupons! Good place to use them.  Wife and I were astonished at how different, upscale and better this chain is compared to a few years ago when we were customers.  I had a very nice restaurant feel, rather than being in a sports bar or a fast food joint posing as a restaurant.  Service very good, great menu, a wine list with decent wines and the food was very good.  Caribbean chicken, petite sirloin and two blackened shrimp/steak combos. All got raves.  A comfortable place for a family or date dinner or lunch.  Fine job, Ruby Tuesday."}
{"text":"we had dinner on Saturday , a party of four, we had two coupons buy one get the other for 50%  our bill was $80,00  when the applied the coupon    the final bill was $75.00  why use a coupon I feel I was ripped off ."}
{"text":"very disappointed dinner, good table service at first said all the right things and asked all the right cooking methods on are meals. Then the meals came, wow was this someone else's is food? meats were well done when spoke about warm pink centers, baked potatoes was far from loaded, but maybe cook was , good side manager comped one uneatable entree."}
{"text":"first I hate chain restaurants when I'm out of my own neighborhood.  why would anyone go to one when on vacation??? I'm stuck in Phoenix and this was the only thing in walking distance. Steak was cooked to perfection, service to perfection,  mashed potatoes and mac and cheese was up there as well.  great job."}
{"text":"You got to try the chicken villa at Ruby Tuesday's it is absolutely delicious and the sauce that they put on it is unbelievable don't misses this is a real treat"}
{"text":"Jessica is the BEST!!! Called in to get an order to go after having surgery. She asked if I wasn't feeling well and after I told her I just had surgery, she hooked me up with crackers and Sprite! Then when we picked it up she had thrown in a dessert. Then she left a little note saying to get better soon!! GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!! Thank you for EVERYTHING!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for the first time on Easter Sunday. The salad bar was fresh and well stocked. We both had the Bourbon hickory chicken; he had the baked potato (I had onion rings) serving was pretty small and the chicken was just Ok. The key lime cake for dessert was good tho and the fruit flavored teas are delicious. Our server was Ashley and she was on point! Very helpful and nice  We would go back, but order something other than that chicken"}
{"text":"I ordered the coastal trio, a 20 dollar dish. My lobster was the size of a medium shrimp and over cooked to the point of mush. My \"grilled\" zucchini was mush and drenched in butter. My tilapia was also mush and drenched in butter. Thank goodness I got the salad bar or I would be starving. The only reason this location is getting 2 starts is because the waitress was a sweetheart and the manager tried to rectify the problem and too the entire meal off my bill."}
{"text":"Too little portion for too expensive food. The portion size and the price just ridiculous.  The service was okay, slowwwww. Will not come to this particular place anymore. Maybe other Ruby Tuesday are better than this one???!!!"}
{"text":"Dinner here was very good.  Service was excellent and the salad bar was well stocked."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks while on travel.  Great happy hour drrrrranks and walking distance to my hotel!  The relaxer was the drink of choice and yup, I went large for a dollar more. Can't beat rhat.  And does the munchies,  try the tempura beans and the artichoke dip. Soooooo good. Usually you run out of dip before the chips. With this, it was the opposite and the MOD will make sure you are well taken care off."}
{"text":"We haven't ben there for a long time.  I am pretty sure we won't be back.  We went because a friend had coupons and we were on our way to a show.  When my husband and I arrived, we were brought to a booth.  I told the hostess that we wanted a table, not a booth.  So, where did she bring us?  to another booth   I told her no booth, table.  She finally brought us to a table.  Mind you, the restaurant was not even a 1/4 full. I really hate when a server says, \"what would WE like to have?\"  Are you joining us?  no   You don't need  to include yourself into our group. Food was just ok. The ladies' room was dirty, very dirty.  To top it off, the soap dispensers were bone dry as in empty for days.  A server used the restroom and walked out without washing her hands.  How could she?  There was no soap! nah   Never ever going back again Our visit was Saturday, February 11 at 4:30 PM."}
{"text":"As long as you charge for kid drink refills you will get a bad review & little or no tip. Your waiter did a great job, Dan - still only Left 5 on a 62 bill. Salad bar amazing - Food from the kitchen - fantastic. Set by the bathrooms horrible and had to listen to your rude waitresses (not males) cussing and talking crap about customers with my kids around. Thanks"}
{"text":"If you haven't been to one in a while the menu is new and much better.  Of course the salad bar is great."}
{"text":"Ruby Tuesday used to be in our rotation but since we're never WOW'd it has been at least 6 months since we've been in for dinner.   We had a coupon for $15 off our meal, no restrictions so we happily came in for dinner. They recently (sometime in the past 6 months) got a new menu that was loaded with new options. I was sad to see my zucchini sliders disappear but half the time we were told they were out anyway. I kept things simple and just ordered the Veggie Trio which comes with three sides and the salad bar.   I don't remember what my bf ordered, he wasn't overly impressed, it was just OK.   We didn't leave hungry or unsatisfied. But, what really got us was the service. He was fantastic, I kept telling my bf that he could easily work in a fine dining restaurant, that's the type of service we received.   Service was a 5  Food was a 3.5"}
{"text":"Truly one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. Arrived at 6:30 on a Saturday and had a few minutes wait so went to the bar to order a drink. Only one bartender working and it takes over 10 minutes to place an order. By that time our table was ready. Placed our food order and it took an hour to get our food. Bad part was people who came in after us got their food and finished their meal before we got ours. I had ordered steak with double order of onion rings. Half the rings are cooked right, the other half burnt to a crisp. Asked for replacement onion rings which were brought out. Perfectly cooked, including the hair attached to one. Lost my appetite at that point. Figured that I would get something on my bill comped or something but nothing.  Really was a miserable experience."}
{"text":"Ruby Tuesday's has always been one of my favorite restaurants. The salad bar is amazing and this particular restaurant has one of that best salad bars I've seen. It was very clean and very well refrigerated. I also had the chicken fresco and it was very good. Healthy, hot, and tasted delicious. I highly recommend this location to others."}
{"text":"Had the appetizer typhoon shrimp for 10.00 for popcorn shrimp 10 pieces and teaspoon of buffalo sauce covering the shrimp certainly not worth the amount. Steak was chewy and of poor quality. Better off going to Outback for same price but better quality. RUBY YOU BROKE MY HEART"}
{"text":"First time here, my food was great. I love shrimp anyway. I ordered the Thai Phoon Shrimp.it was delicious. I took off a star because the table were kind of close together and they kept sitting other guest to close instead of spreading them out throughout the place. Everybody seems to be bunched up together on one side while the other side was empty. I took off another star because the salad bar did not have a wide enough selection."}
{"text":"Very good food. No wait.  Very good service.  The ribs fell off the bone!!!!   Keila k was a fabulous waitress.  Everyone was eat here and ask for her she is A sweetheart!!!!!"}
{"text":"Once a 5 star now 2  Service was just fine all around.  Todays visit was an eye opener. The new menu is very expensive. Prices are way up.  The restaurant was very warm apron arrival but corrected by someone.  I use to love this restaurant but now I am just luke warm, and so was my soup. It jiggled (like Jello) when I moved it. it was always so good, not today.   It's still run well and better then Applebees but that's not saying much.   Menu prices soared from $2 to $5  since my last visit, and it seems the quality and care has diminished.  2 servers and a host were the only visible staff so It's not a busy unit."}
{"text":"I always liked Ruby Tuesday, in Gilbert, AZ because you can always get in , when every other restaurant around them is busy.  I like the salad bar.  But RT is not good at a signature  dish or meal and seem to change their menu, waaay too much!  RT needs to decide what their food identity is and make that food extra good and reasonable.  FILTH ALERT!!!!  The other night we were seated by the wood blinds that surround the outer tables by the windows, they were covered with DIRT as far as the eye could see!!!  I used my napkin to wipe the dirt and show tbe manager....HE SAID, \"THEY HAVE NO ONE TO CLEAN THE RESTAURANT, EXCEPT THE EMPLOYEES AND THEY  WON'T CLEAN THE BLINDS .\"   Are you kidding me????   No janitor, no cleaning crew, no budget to clean, only employees????  Well, \"ha ha\" Mr. Manager, (who was laughing at me , while he shares, \" it won't be happening\")...DIRT AND GRIME ARE not funny and that is nauseating, DISGUSTING and disturbing!!!! ( especially, your nonchalant attitude!!!!)  A chain restaurant that does not have a cleaning crew in place, could put the public health at risk!  Are the employees cleaning the toilet and then serving the customers????  I  don't eat with dirty ANYTHING in my own house, let alone PAY BIG BUCKS to SIT IN YOUR FILTHY RESTAURANT, surrounded by grime!!!!  Appalling!!!  CLOSE THE DAMN RESTAURANT AND CLEAN THE RUGS, BLINDS, KITCHEN AND BATHROOMS FROM TOP TO BOTTOM...budget the cleaning and make your menu smaller...  Otherwise in the words of Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones:   \"GOODBYE, RUBY TUESDAY, WHO COULD HANG A NAME ON YOU?  WHEN YOU CHANGE WITH EVERY NEW DAY, STILL I'M GONNA MISS YOU!\"  Let me know when that dump is cleaned!!! Otherwise, goodbye!"}
{"text":"Fiance & I drove down to this location to use our 2for1 coupon and a gift card burning a hole in our pocket.  We were seated right away and the lay out of the place is much more inviting than the location that closed in Summerlin.  Tom was our server and he was nice but busy taking care of all the tables in our area alone.  We each had the salad bar, ice tea and the ribs.  A nice assortment on the bar, but no potato salad which I thought was a standard on every salad bar.  We also enjoyed the new offering of cupcakes (Red Velvet or Carrot) and they were very moist with butter frosting.  Overall a very nice lunch."}
{"text":"So I have been coming here more because my kids like eating here. Tonight it was just me and my son. The place was pretty packed but we got seated almost immediately. Since it was just the two of us they sat us by the bar area. Our server was the bartender. She didn't seem to have a lot of personality. We ordered our drinks at the same as the food. It literally took about 15-20 minutes to get 2 glasses of water. We also had to ask someone else for the biscuits. I believe she was a manager but not very friendly. We ordered the same thing, top sirloin steak; I ordered mine medium well and my son ordered his well done. Mine was leaning more towards well done and was tough and chewy. My son's, even though he ordered it well done, was not tough. I told the bartender the one time she came to check on us. I was in a hurry to eat and go so I told her I would eat it. She said okay and walked away. No mgr was called to the table and although I wasn't expecting a free meal I would have appreciated some money of my dinner. These are 14.00 dollar steaks after all! I've actually had better steaks at Bob Evans in the past. The bartender did say sorry about your food when she was handing me the credit card slip to sign. Too little too late If you ask me!"}
{"text":"In on a wed night. Sat at the bar.  Terrible service. Wasn't given a happy hr menu Wasn't asked how the food was. Bartender didn't want to accommodate a request I made that the manager made for someone with the same request 10 minutes after me.  Food was good tho. He must be lazy since he can't be an energetic bartender towards the end of the shift."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this short and sweet.  The location could use some love and updating inside. The place smells funny and the booths and decor are dirty ex. dirty drips remain on the walls in the booth and could use a good wipe down.   However, our server was attentive, and accommodating. The salad bar was stocked well and looked very fresh. Our burgers were cooked to order, juicy and tasty and it came out fast! Prices appear to be fair for the items and the menu is vast."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service. It always takes 5-10 minutes to get a drink order in. Doesn't matter busy or nobody here. Food isn't bad but service is horrible."}
{"text":"Whoa! Ruby Tuesdays! This place does not exist in my area. I've only seen commercials of this place. It was a myth to me until now. It's a regular type restaurant similar to Marie Calenders and those type of places. Very friendly service.. very typical menu. Nothing out of the ordinary here.  I had the steak with veggies. I also ordered a side of pot stickers. The steak was cooked medium.. I asked for medium rare. The pot stickers were decent. The peanut sauce with it wasnt too good. My buddy ordered the spinach artichoke dip. That was a very heavy and filling dish. We also had the sampler platter and the item that stood out were the chicken strips.. Very moist inside.. surprisingly.  Glad to finally give this place a try."}
{"text":"Go elsewhere. Anywhere else. It appears as though there is zero management, customer service comes and goes, and the staff's urgency to serve guests is optional.  Aside from that, our mashed potatoes were great and the brownie sundae was phenomenal. Would have liked to enjoy the whole experience though."}
{"text":"To date this restaurant still holds the title for the worst dining experience ive ever had.  Very slow and disrespectful waitresses who like to argue with you when you have to send back your \"medium well\" burger because it's still red and bleeding.   It took us over an hour to get our food on a slow night ... turns out its because our first waitress left for the day and didnt hand off her ticket to someone else.  I urge you to reconsider before spending your money in this place."}
{"text":"Honestly after reading the bad reviews... You can tell its coming from people who have never worked a service job. I come here for exactly what I know I'm gonna get-cheap drinks. If you want exceptional service  go to Mastros city hall and pay $15 for the same cocktail. It all goes back to people working by what their paid. Duh."}
{"text":"I think that everyone really needs to know the ugly truth behind #Ruby Tuesday. They do NOT want children that are special needs in there restaurants we were treated so poorly. I contacted them and we never heard back from anyone. I can show anyone the message that were sent and opened by them without any response back. Please take a stand for our kids that are special and reconsider before eating here."}
{"text":"Great ribs but lousy coupon usage.  They offer free appetizer but you can't use coupon with it.   They tell you to sign up for it knowing you have a coupon. Which I think is BS. The service was good but not getting past the scam here.   The salad bar is good but was much better a couple years ago.   The mix salads, like broccoli salad, seems prepared not made in restaurant.  They are good but not rich with flavor. Zucchini was better cut as sticks not as thick slices.   The chicken and crab cakes was really good.   Crab cakes were small but tasted good.  Chicken was chicken. The Texas dusted ribs were ready good.   The six bones were long with decent amount of meat.for half rack. The garlic mashed taters were good but who is out of baked potatoes at 615pm?  Just enough to say is was OK.   But I don't like places that play with rewards and coupons.  The corporation pays huge money to formulate ad plans and you can't use this because a server tells you how great that is and you can't use coupon if you listen to the employee.  It'll be awhile before I step foot in there!"}
{"text":"I traveled hundreds of miles for the new burgers they were promoting and unfortunately they weren't up to par. I went to Wendy's and had a very similar experience.   I only give it three stars because I had prime beef instead of regular beef and I did taste the difference.   Fries were meh! And service was below par.   Disappointed."}
{"text":"I have to say, for a chain, they do go out of their way to make sure you pleased with your meal.  I'm not complaining by any means.  But the only time I see a manager (typically in other establishments, it's simply because the customer requested to see one). And no it's not me, I usually don't call them out on service or food like that.  Although, I've witnessed it numerous times and it's usually over petty reasons.  But carrying on, we had a party of four tonight and my little one.  The wait staff is friendly, helpful and quick to turn out food orders.  Our server was Kacie and she is simply a delight.  My brother-in-law had ordered a steak rare.  He was not happy with it and they were quick to oblige him with a new order.  It was then brought out and he was extremely happy.  He said it was spot on rare.  Kacie and the manager had come by numerous times just to check in on us as we reveled in our meal.  It's a shame that we're out of towners, because the food and service were both great here and if it wasn't for distance, we'd definitely frequent this location."}
{"text":"My family eats here often. Always good food and good service. Tried the $13.99 three course meal deal. Okay for the price but not the tastiest of meals I've eaten here. Had the ribs, not impressed but the chocolate cake for dessert was delicious. My husband had the same deal but the sirloin and key lime cake which he said was pretty good. Great variety of kids meals but drinks aren't included. We'll continue going back. LOVE the salad bar. Alanna was our server and service was fast, attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"I had some family from out of town who wanted a good salad bar, so we choose Ruby Tuesday's near 77 and 485. The restaurant was slow and our service was a struggle at best. Our server seemed confused about his job, and there was very little teamwork. The manager, or who looked to be in charge must've been stuck in the kitchen. The food tasted good, but the overall service needs improvement.  Training, training, training!"}
{"text":"I was glad to see that they have a wide selection of healthy options. I ordered grilled salmon, green beans and spaghetti squash. Everything was good. My friend got something similar with rice - he enjoyed his too. This is a chain and I had to go, so it was normal for a chain - you get the typical service and food."}
{"text":"2 stars only because our server was very nice and attentive.    Food was not good at all.  We both chose chicken entrees.  The chicken was undercooked, the sauces had no flavor. One was a hickory bbq, the other a cream sauce with mushrooms.  The mashed potatoes tasted like instant.  Ruby Tuesday used to be known for their wonderful salad bar.  It was very limited and out of a few things as well.   Unfortunately we will not be back."}
{"text":"Just an update on my complaint with Ruby Tuesday. The following day (Apr 4th) I received an email from Guest Services telling me that \"we are forwarding your concerns to our senior management, for follow up with the restaurant team. We anticipate a response directly to you within 48 business hours.\" On Apr 10th after hearing nothing from anybody I emailed Guest Services back: I just want to make sure that I understand correctly. Is this the follow up for the senior management team? The first email states that they will respond directly with me in 48 business hours. 48 hours from Tuesday April the 4th is Thursday April the 6th. Have not heard from anybody, just this email.  In response to this email I then received from Guest Services a coupon for $30.00 off and the Gastonia manager called on Monday in the 5:00pm hour but I missed his call. I returned his call the following day at about the same time he had called me but he was not there. I was told that he would return my call. Today a week later, I am yet to hear from him.   As stated in my original email since moving to Gastonia NC, the local Ruby Tuesday has been very poor with no improvement. I tried the restaurant repeatedly before give up on the Gastonia location but I would go to Ruby Tuesday when I traveled. I never want a coupon for a \"free meal\", just to have my local Ruby Tuesday improve so that I could return to being a frequent and loyal customer again. I have to say though that since corporate seems to think that throwing \"free meals\" at customers to make them return instead of improving the restaurant is not a place I want to be at. You Ruby Tuesday, have lost a customer permanently."}
{"text":"I too had not been to a Ruby Tuesday in forever. I corralled it in with TGI Fridays et al., and always mentally mix it up with the frat boy sleazefest that is Fat Tuesday on University and Mill. Unfair, I know. Sorry, RT!  We ended up here at the Tempe Marketplace, and decided to give the place a shot. It was way swankier than I thought, but in a very \"minimal identity\" sort of way. For $8.99 you can obtain access to the aforementioned salad bar and your choice of a small meal. (Soups, sliders, small sandwiches, etc.) I got the quiche (which was huge?!) and came with some cherry tomatoes and mozzarella in a light, pleasant dressing. The salad bar wasn't anything out of this world, but everything tasted great, seemed fresh, clean, and for 8.99 I was impressed. Next time you're buying socks at Ross, this would be a great stop off for lunch."}
{"text":"This is usually a good spot for good food and reliable service. Tonight everything was dirty..Napkins, silverware, plates and glasses..Hopefully they will correct this."}
{"text":"Always amazing! I'm vegan and there are a ton of options! The salad bar is a must. Then you can add 3 hot sides to the salad making it a amazing value!"}
{"text":"I only came here to have the salad bar, and this go round it was just okay. I do love that they have ham on there and the croutons are so good and soft.    The Chicken BLT I ordered didn't have the bacon on it, and by the time I took a few bites and waited for our server, I didn't care about the bacon any longer, I just wanted them to take the $1 off or however much would've been. And the Manager came by and took my salad bar off so that was nice of him.  We ordered the Mottz sticks and the were ok, I like Applebee's ones better."}
{"text":"Cheap prices. Great food! Never had a bad meal here, and the salad bar is amazing. The staff is always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch by myself. The bar staff was very friendly and attentive and I didn't have any issues. If you're here try the salad bar it's amazing."}
{"text":"I had a birthday coupon for a free burger. We had been going to Ruby Tuesday's pretty regularly over the past year to use emailed special coupons that generally gave us $10 off a meal. As we ate there we came to the conclusion that Ruby Tuesday's food is average at best. So we stopped going.  When I received the burger coupon I thought well its free... So my wife and I went to the Ruby Tuesday at Torringdon Place and I had my free burger. I have to say that it really wasn't anything special & I think that's a shame. The closest burger joint is Red Robin over in Torringdon Market and just having the burger wrapped so it doesn't fall apart is such a step upwards that it makes them unique & special. I guess the next time I find myself at Ruby Tuesday's will be for my birthday next year."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience coming here the other day. It was my first time to a ruby Tuesdays and I'll never be back. I ordered a very simple meal.. bacon cheeseburger with just meat and cheese. They had to bring me my order four different times, and it still wasn't right. First, my friend said that he didn't think the server was listening very well when I told him my order. My friend got up to find our server, and make sure that he knew I only wanted meat and cheese. When the food came out, the burger had everything on it. I told my server that it was supposed to be meat and cheese only. He took it back to the kitchen, and brought it back out with no cheese but everything else still on it. I told him it still wasn't right, so he took it back again. When he brought it back out, it had only the patty. Not even cheese. I told him it still wasn't right, and his way to fix it was bringing me out a single slice of unmelted cheese to slap on my burger. There wasn't even bacon on it, even though I ordered the bacon burger. The manager came by to see what was going on, and didn't do a thing. She said it was only miscommunication. Sorry, but no one should mess up an order four times when it was just a simple burger. Then for the first time about 5 minutes before we were about to leave, the server finally stopped by to ask if we wanted refills. My friend asked for a quick one, but the server brought back the completely wrong drink. Our entire order was messed up. Do not go to this ruby tuesdays, you will have a terrible experience. The manager had to talk to the tables around us as well and apologize for the service they had recieced too. Don't waste your money here!!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend should have walked out right after we walked in. We came in on a Friday afternoon to grab lunch before I went to work. Right when we walked in there was a smell. I want to say it was like a wet mop or something. I'm really not sure. But we should have know then. We sat down and ordered some drinks, apps, and the meals. My boyfriend ordered one of their specialty drinks but it tasted like just juice, not good! They brought out a sample of their bread or something. It was a little dry. We ordered a sampler to start which wasn't bad but how do you mess up chicken fingers and onion rings. The food just didn't seem fresh. I was cold. Luckily I went for the salad bar which was actually the best part to me. I got to make it the way I like and add whatever I wanted and go back if needed. They had cucumbers and cheese and crutons and all kinda of dressing. We got our meals soon after and I ordered a burger that just didn't taste right. I couldn't finish it. My boyfriend ordered the salmon and it was awful. He asked me to try it and I literally spit it out. I had a side of fries that were soggy and gross. It was just overall a really bad experience. The waitress was really nice and keep our drinks full but it's just not a place we would return to."}
{"text":"Ruby Tuesdays is stuck in a tragic location in my opinion. It's right next to Red Robin which is my all time favorite American chain. So naturally I never go there since I'd much rather have Red Robin. I'm glad my parents convinced me to come with them though.  Everybody was satisfied with their meal and their salad bar looked very fresh. My grandfather took part in it and each time he came back I was surprised at the abundance of things he managed to find there.   My meal was smoked salmon with broccoli and there weren't any complains there. The server was polite and attentive. Honestly I don't have any complaints. The prices were a little higher than I'd expected but well worth it. The atmosphere was nice and quiet and relaxed. I can always appreciate that.   Great place for a classy simple American meal."}
{"text":"I am not really a Ruby Tuesday kind of guy, and we had stopped here prior to making a trip to Sam's Club. The first thing you see when you walk in is the big salad bar. Now salad bars, as a rule, scare the hell out of me. Primarily because they're normally full of germs. However this one actually looks really really good! We were sat immediately and despite our server having a couple rather large parties, he was prompt efficient and in a great mood. I wasn't super hungry however I did want some of that salad bar so we elected to get an appetizer of the tempura fried green beans. The green beans came out looking like a Pinterest fails. What they look like in the menu look no where near what the experiment we were served looks like. However tasty. I ended up getting a strict order for about ten bucks of two very small turkey and cheese sandwiches with a very small order of fries and the salad bar. Turns out it was just the perfect portion and satisfied me just fine. My only gripes are the following: I was constantly being buzzed by fruit flies and not just one fruit fly with an army of fruit flies that I was not the only table experiencing this problem. And the other issue is at the automatic door closer deal on the entrance door was broken and exceptionally heavy door I was doing a great job of biting you in your ankles and slammed into your back as you enter the restaurant. However it probably will not stop me from going to the restaurant again for a quick and decently priced meal."}
{"text":"I do love the tilapia and some dishes over here. I never had a problem with the service. My biggest complaint was that the whole interior seemed to be coated in a thin film of cooking grease. You can smell it as you walk in. If I was the owner, I'd close the whole house place down for a weekend and give all surfaces a good scrub, the carpet especially. That's it. That's all that needs to be done."}
{"text":"Horrible!!! Terrible service, took over an hour while other 3 other tables that came 10minutes got their food before us. My table alone would of been over $100.00 and they brought two adult plates while kids and salad bar just sat for an additional minutes watching the waitress take care of the Neighboring tables condiments while we all sat asking for the rest of our food.  We asked for a manager and the waitress brought mayonnaise saying she thought we asked for mayo. Kitchen manager finally comes politely stated she isn't the floor manager.   She doesn't have an excuse but she will take care of our food if we wanted. So we took the opportunity to leave since we said we were just about to leave anyway.   She offered to at least pack the kids food. I declined after she stated my kids could of just went to the salad bar because the the plates are readily available which no one communicated.   It wasn't busy and there is no excuse. The appropriate manager should of responded to the table in the first place. The surrounding tables had the same menu items we had ordered x2 so it is just unacceptable to not have been serviced."}
{"text":"The staff of this particular location make you feel sorry for going there. The inhospitable attitude states with the hostess (one of the rudest I've experienced) to wait staff who don't care of your patronage to the manager who evidently turns a blind eye to the clear problems of service. The worst insult comes in way of food that look like it was prepared in the microwave and thrown together - crab cakes are not supposed to look like lumps or broken pieces, the steamed broccoli is not supposed to smell of steamed carrots. There are so many problems at so many levels at this location. I wonder if anyone from Ruby Tuesday Corporate even checks up on this location. Maybe this one is the black sheep of the Ruby Tuesday family."}
{"text":"We haven't been here in years, but so glad we stopped by! The Salad Bar is a rare find now that other chains have removed them or closed their doors. This has to be one of the greats, nice variety, everything was well stocked and fresh... after ordering my meal and visiting the salad bar, I kinda wish I stuck with just the salad- it was that good. Next time for sure, I could make my visit just for that! The Hubby and I got the Bourbon Chicken which was tasty but the sauce is really sweet. The kids Cheese Pizza was surprisingly very good- for a kids meal, which our daughter enjoyed. Service was nice and quick, we'll definitely try again soon. Hoping to see a remodel or style update in the future for this famous chain."}
{"text":"Salad bar is the tits. Eddie was our server, he was so sweet and attentive. Our appetizer was taking longer than it should have and the manager gave it to us for free. Overall a good experience !"}
{"text":"Discusting!!!   Ewwww.  Sooo Grosss!!! Right when you walk in the door you get to see the salad bar with the mirror trick so you think it is large and the finger and nose prints all over the glass. The air temperature of the restaurant was just a tad more humid then New York City in August . Our sneakers stuck quite firmly to the floor and made awesome suction cup sounds on the way past six empty table kitted with dirty bits of food where we where placed at a table in between two uncleared tables.  We looked at each other and simply got up and walked out . The host asked why but we were already on the run.  Do not eat here."}
{"text":"Sunday lunch last week not too busy, but kitchen and waiters disorganized.  Waited 40 minutes for our food in which we only got our child's meal. Our burgers were still not out.  Waiter gave no reason or even filled our drinks! He was gathered in prep area with other waiters trying to figure out the mess they were in.  Luckily, we filled up on their salad bar.  Went to kitchen to ask for check and they said they were just waiting on our fries..I said not to worry about any of it since it was now about an hour.  All he said was we are behind in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Years ago this Ruby Tuesday was great. We went about 3 or 4 times a month. It has slowly eroded and our group quit going completely.  Then they came out with their NEW salad bar so we gave it one last try hoping maybe that along with the new salad bar they had stepped up their game a little. We were very disappointed. Service was good as usual but they have increased their prices and lowered the quality of the food. Your money is better spent somewhere else."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of chain restaurants.  I am a firm believer in supporting local business.  But I make an exception for Ruby Tuesday.   My most favorite thing on their menu is the mini-combo.  You can get 2 sliders with fries plus the endless salad bar for as low as $8.99.  You can get cheeseburger sliders, turkey, buffalo chicken, crabcake and salmon patty.  I've tried them all.   I am most in love with their salad bar.  It is well stocked and always fresh.  If you are looking for something quick, affordable and healthy (you don't have to eat the fries), then Ruby Tuesday is a great option."}
{"text":"Hubby and I came here for a lunch date.   Our server was Jeff. He was amazing!!! Attentive, quick with refills, engaged in conversation   I had. Texas dusted ribs, mashed potatoes, and broccoli. My usual and always comes out perfect!!!  Hubby had the ravioli and salad bar He loved it and even brought some home.  It is amazing here"}
{"text":"I tried my first Ruby Tuesday in Alabama last year. Wife has always wondered what was Ruby Tuesday all about. We always got them mixed up with the Tuesday Morning store? Anyway, we were in Avondale for Foster Care training and thought it would be nice to have lunch with our daughter and her boyfriend who lives nearby. Told them to meet us at Ruby Tuesday. This was their first time also. I already knew how this restaurant is about, and after telling everyone about it they all agreed. I shared a pasta dish with my wife, it had black bean, chicken, pasta. Very good. I also had a appetizer  of wings. Wife added a salad bar. Daughter had a soup and salad. She enjoyed the chicken tortilla soup. Jim had the Buffalo Wing sandwich. I didn't hear any complaints about the food. Service was good, place was clean. I decided not to have the salad bar since I looked at the bar and wasn't to impress with the choices.  This location has easy access off the 10 FWY. I can see this place being very busy during NASCAR and Spring Training games. There was nothing really special about this chain, But the menu shows some very interesting things. Since I am trying to watch my physic! I can't try them?? Good place, good food, good service,"}
{"text":"They messed-up an order of mine, but the Manager caught it and as soon as I called back in she was already aware and waiting on me.  Ha!  They even threw in some shrimp as an extra make-up for me.  How thoughtful!  The ribs are great and the service is solid.  I'd recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We haven't been to a Ruby Tuesday in a long time;  it will be an even longer time before we would ever consider returning.  Frankly, there are just too many really good restaurants in the area to waste our time and money there. The salad bar is mediocre at best, they were out of baked potatoes at 6:30 in the evening, and my husband's steak was so tough he finally gave up about half way through. I ordered a petite portion, he ordered a regular portion and they were the very same size! We were just going to finish and leave without commenting on anything, but our waitress asked how everything was, so my husband mentioned the toughness of the steak.  Her reply was, \"Sorry 'bout that,\" with a tone that this was a common occurrence. Goodbye Ruby Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Love Ruby Tuesday's. Endless salad bar, FTW!"}
{"text":"Dinner was great.  We went back with my parents for lunch and the service was poor.  Other than that, I did like dinner service and may go back again in the evenings.  As for the salad bar, it's good.  Nice touch to add it as a side with a meal."}
{"text":"Love,  love , love , love Ruby Tuesday...I've taken family and friends from out of town and each time the service was good but the food was Better"}
{"text":"Been living near the place 2 years, Went to get to go food and walked into place and was ignored for 15 min, asked waitress for help and was told manager would help me 5 min later no one came by and waitress stoped even looking at me, walked out!  Would have loved get some to go food well I guess I will go a few more years to try again"}
{"text":"It took forever to get our food and when it did finally arrive three of our orders were completely wrong. My soup was gross and cold and my friend's alfredo pasta barely had any sauce on it. The manager was rude to his staff especially to our waitress who was the only nice thing about the restaurant. I will never go again."}
{"text":"MUST READ!!! PUBLIC SAFETY!!! So the family and I decided to hit Ruby Tuesday's for lunch. I've tried the restaurant in the past and didn't like it but I thought it's been a few years so we should try it again. Well I regret now! First our waiter was very absent minded. She had stains all over her shirt. It wasn't very busy but she seemed overwhelmed. She had a hard time remembering what was on the menu as I had to explain to her what was on the menu when we ordered. She got our drink order incorrect. Getting drinks took 20 minutes. Food took another 20 -30 minutes on top of that. I noticed around the dinning room multiple tables that were cleared with newly wrapped cutlery but food still on the table. I felt our table was a bit wobbly. I looked under what I can only describe as a fo leather table cloth covering our table which was  to my surprise made of ply wood and some of the ends had be cracked off. Not a big deal really but kinda wrong they hide it like that.    Next the mugs they used for our drinks were plastic not glass. They were a bit cloudy looking but AZ has hard water so most AZ residents understand that is a thing so I didn't really mind. However I requested a refill and the cup I received was clearly dirty!!! (I attached a picture) taking a look at the other cups I could easily scrape off what I can describe only as a layer of film inside the cup. I felt ill afterwards at just the thought. This is clearly unacceptable!  We ordered an appetizer, the Italian Five-Cheese Skillet, which reads on the menu: \"If you love cheese sticks, try this blend of melted cheeses baked in a skillet with tomato basil sauce topped with Parmesan crumbs. Served with our garlic Parmesan flatbread.\" But instead we got some sampler thing which contained what what I think was list plus onion rings and chicken poppers. The flat bread was stale and the onion rings cold and the cheese skillet was tasteless. The kids got Mac n cheese which was $3.99 for about what looked like a cup of Mac. Side of fries (not included in meal had to pay $2.49) and a drink (not included $1.79) The kids said the Mac and cheese tasted fine. The wife ordered the Double Decker Chicken which she said tasted fine. I ordered the Southern Style Chicken Tender Dinner which also tasted fine.   The problem here was not the food taste but clearly the service, the long wait and most importantly, the cleanliness! I am concerned about the standards this place offers and highly advise against eating here!!!"}
{"text":"First impression...leave a door open or something to air out the place. It smells so bad. I can't even describe it... but maybe like musty carpets/old furniture that need to be cleaned? It's disgusting. You walk in and it just takes over everything. Forget about dinner.   Food was fine, nothing special. Service was fine. Didn't check on us but glad we didn't need anything. Probably won't be back unless it's the only option. Sorry."}
{"text":"The service was good for a busy Sun. PM. Salad bar I rate it a 8 out of 10. More pasta and potatoes salad needed. Food was very good. I'll go again for dinner."}
{"text":"Horrible food. $11 salad bar half of the things missing and zero selection. Had a vodka martini. Zero buzz totally watered down. Going back NEVER!"}
{"text":"I got the hickory bourbon pork chop with onion rings and grilled zuchinni. It was sooo good! The pork chop was very tender and the sauce on it was plentiful and rather sweet. The zucchini was perfect and the Panko onion rings were on point. Our server was a very friendly Hispanic lady who checked on us regularly and refilled our Cokes often. We never went dry ! It was a Monday night so it wasn't busy at all in there which is probably why the service was so fast ! I'm a huge fan of ruby tuesdays wings and they didn't disappoint! I got them mild! Lots of meat on them and they were hot and juicy! Ooooh yes! What a good meal!"}
{"text":"I went for my lunch hour and was extremely impressed with the speed of service for my meal.  The table service was not so great, but the food delivery was very timely and allowed me to get back to work on time.  The server only came around one time after I placed my order, and I was forced to go to the bar to get refills for drinks.  There were just a few other tables in her section, so I did not understand why she was not more attentive.  I will be returning to give them another chance."}
{"text":"Hickory bourbon salmon, lobster tail and sirloin. Staffs were welcoming and food was great!"}
{"text":"Have to tip my hat to the staff at Ruby Tuesday. We made a reservation at 6:30 for approximately 25 people and ended up showing up at 5 with approximately 30 people. In spite of that, they got us seated promptly, and took great care of us! Food was delicious and we had a great time!"}
{"text":"Service was polite and prompt, dining area and restroom were clean. The door to the ladies room does need cleaned, however. Greasy or sticky looking stuff all over the glass.  The food. I was there a few weeks ago, not super hungry, but meeting with a friend. Ordered the green bean tempura which was disappointing. Previously slightly overcooked green beans were dipped in tempura batter and deep fried, creating a dark, wet, limp bean in under seasoned crisp. Meh.  Went back last evening with a friend because the new garden bar (as opposed to salad bar) had arrived. Very disappointed. Additions seemed mostly dressing choices, some mixed seeds and a few other things that were not at all creative. Not bad, just undeserving of the promotional fanfare.  The \"back by popular demand\" biscuits, per the server, were laughable and in fact, that is exactly what I did. They were the size of a golf ball, cut in half. Dry, tasteless and exactly 1 per person, almost as if they knew they wouldn't be eaten. They were right!"}
{"text":"Waited at the bar on a Tuesday night for over 45 minutes for a to-go order. Didn't seem like there was any sense of urgency."}
{"text":"This is Ruby Tuesday is located in North Las Vegas on Craig Rd. I visited this location January 2016 for dinner time with a party of three.  Atmosphere: Nice and quiet Upon entering the establishment, the lighting compliments the red-color surroundings. The restaurant is clean and easy to maneuver.   Service: Pretty good! My party of three was seated right away and were asked for our beverages right away. The waitress was nice and polite to us. We were served our food in a reasonably quick fashion.   Food: Good moments, bad moments The food served to us was both the best and worst part of my dining experience here. We enjoyed the Appetizer Sampler, which was pretty good.  The fries and mozzarella sticks were my personal favorites.  I had the chicken with crab cakes, onion rings, and zucchini. The chicken was ok, but it was too buttery. The crab cakes had a strong crab taste to them. Yes, they're called \"crab\" cakes, but I didn't taste much of the \"cake\" part. I also ordered a side of zucchini, but the zucchini I was served was thinly sliced, oily pieces of zucchini. That didn't look to appetizing, actually.  For dessert, I shared the cheesecake sundae with my friends. I was not as great as it looked. I thought that since it was a \"sundae\", it would all be cold. It was an unpleasant surprise to know that the cheesecake part was warm. This made the consumption process a little difficult since the sundae kept melting on me. Still tasted like strawberry, cheesecake, and ice cream, but with varying temperatures and textures (Weird, huh?).  Overall: Would visit once in a blue moon I really like this place the first time I went here about 2-3 years ago, but I guess the quality of the food had waned since then. I won't stop anyone from visiting this place. It's by no means a horrible place, but definitely weigh out your options. There are great moments, but there are unpleasant experiences to come, as well."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic, the food was awful.  I ordered the Baja chicken tacos. Both tacos were frozen at the bottom, that is meat and veggies included. I also ordered the spinach artichoke dip. The dip was bland and definitely didn't taste fresh. The price of these items definitely dies bot match the quality. I was really disappointed and won't be back again in the futures"}
{"text":"Dinner for 8 on a Friday night. The new and improved menu is sub par. I thought I'd play it safe and ordered the dry rubbed ribs ...... and yes they were dry. Not one was too thrilled with their food but since it was a special occasion we let it slide.  EDIT : as to the gal who doesn't know what Black and blue is : seared outside, still rare on the inside. Not on the menu LOL."}
{"text":"We walked in expecting everything to be new and fresh...like the commercials say??? Well ehhh wrong, there was new menus however. My friend said \"Maybe they come and switch out the lamps after you sit down just like on the commercial?\" We had fun with this so he asked the waiter. The waiter informed us that they are one of the few that will be staying with the original theme Tiffany lamps and all. After he left I thought to myself....  What if they didnt change any of them?!? What if they give you that BS story at every RT you go to?!? What if they get away with it??? Somone should confirm this for me!!  Fresh Avocado Quesadilla Perfectly ripe avocados, grated Swiss cheese, and freshly made pico de gallo in a grilled flour tortilla. Very good for a veg-o-saurus like me mmmm I will go back. The new menu was the only reason I tried RT food again I usually just drink there for HR."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat a nice relaxing dinner. My favorite thing about this place is their garden bar! If you like a good mixed drink order their Ruby relaxer, it's the perfect ratio for safe fun. I always order their chicken and mushroom alfredo. It has a hint of spice and the noodles aren't soggy or drowned in sauce. My plate has always been served hot and the waiters and waitresses are very attentive and quick. It's great for a quiet evening out if you aren't in the mood to cook."}
{"text":"My number one pet peeve about this place is the lack of waiting space. The only seating area holds about six people and everyone ends up standing around the salad bar and door, making it very difficult to navigate. On my last visit, we arrived and we're told there would be a ten minute wait...half of the tables were empty. With the lack of wait space, even if they were understaffed, the priority needed to be seating the guests - the hostess seemed to be in her own world.  The food here is always good, nothing special,  and the waitress was nice. All in all, I'd recommend calling ahead to make a reservation if you have any interest in eating here."}
{"text":"A small group of us (three co-workers and me) descended on RT for lunch.  I was in the mood for salad, and they have an expansive salad bar that is either included in multiple combos on the menu (salad + soup, salad + sliders, salad + quesadilla, etc) or can be added to any menu item.  We all went salad + and were raring to get up there!  Oh no... rusty lettuce.  In three of the four bins!! (baby spinach appeared unscathed)  We reported it to a passing staff person, but they didn't refill while we were up there.  The rest of the bar was stellar, but to have browning lettuce be your first look at the bar is just not good!  My White Chicken Chili was tasty - spicy, creamy, white meat.  Our waitress did a very nice job, with the highlight being that she brought out a cup of Thousand Island dressing (not on the bar) before one of my co-workers, who only uses TI on his salad, had a complete meltdown."}
{"text":"My husband already left a detailed review of our recent dining experience, but I wanted to write a review from my own perspective.   We went to this Ruby Tuesday today and I have to say, it was one of the worst dining experiences we've had. We have only been to this location once back in 2008, I believe... we didn't care for it much, but we decided to give it another try since we were looking to go somewhere new.   Horrible, horrible, horrible. I hate to leave reviews like this, but man, this place was just terrible.  First, the service. Our waitress was very ditsy. I am sorry to say this and I am not trying to be mean, but she really was. She kept forgetting things and making mistakes, over and over. She was also very slow at everything. It took forever for our order to be taken, forever to get our drinks... my salad came out like 15-20 minutes before our appetizer. And in the end, it took forever for us to get out of there.  We ordered the Italian Five Cheese Skillet appetizer. First of all, the description of the appetizer is not exactly the same as the appetizer itself. It came with onion rings and chicken poppers, which was not mentioned anywhere on the menu. We felt the description was misleading compared to what we received. The flatbread was incredibly stale and our onion rings were COLD. It was very unappetizing. At the end our waitress asked how everything was and I told her my thoughts on the appetizer. We honestly barely touched it. Rather than have a manager come over, apologize and offer to comp it like most places would, the waitress returned to our table with the menu and basically read us the description of the appetizer -- which we had already read. Again, it said NOTHING about including onion rings or chicken poppers. And the appetizer was not cooked well at all, as I mentioned. I felt like this was poor service. After I clarified that we just weren't satisfied with it regardless, she said she would speak to her manager about comping the appetizer. The manager NEVER came to our table at all, and it took FOREVER for her to actually comp it.   Another issue I had was the portion size of the kids' Mac and cheese. It was the smallest portion size ever. Maybe a cup worth? And it came in a super tiny bowl, like the size of a ramekin. We paid $3.99 for it and that didn't even include drinks or sides -- those were EXTRA.   Toward the end of the meal, my husband noticed that the refill cups we received (which were a cheap plastic) were DIRTY! They literally had this brown filmy stuff on the inside that you could kind of scrape off with your finger. It was disgusting!! I am REALLY hoping we don't get sick from eating there now.  And, get this you guys, my husband noticed that the table we sat at was LITERALLY just plywood with a table cloth over it! How bizarre is that?  The flavor of our meals themselves were fine. No issues there. It was all just the things I described above that made our dining experience a very poor one. We were there for nearly TWO HOURS due to the slow service and they weren't even that busy.  I do not recommend going here. Sorry, Ruby Tuesday."}
{"text":"I've only been to one other Ruby Tuesday and that was in the East Coast. We came here to have dinner with family friends since it was close to their house. Service was pretty ok, I did wish they paid more attention to us, though. Food was pretty good. Their garden fresh salad bar had tons of great choices, but I wish the salad dressings were labeled (some were, but those were the REALLY obvious ones). Try their lobster macaroni. PRETTY GOOD and great deal on weekends. The complimentary scones or w/e was also a surprise... I can't quite figure out what makes it taste SO GOOD."}
{"text":"Excellent meal after a long travel day! Nikki met us at the door and she was as nice as she could be. She sat us immediately and Martin was out server. He guided us through the menu and got out meal and drinks out quickly. Abby the manager also stopped by to make sure we were happy and comfortable. Food was good and delivered as promised. Highly recommend this restaurant for a nice quiet meal."}
{"text":"Yes, this is a chain.  They're a Chili's clone (or a TGIF clone, etc).  Restaurants like this are a dime a dozen.  But we had a coupon...  So we show up for lunch.  Staff is friendly.  Service is adequately attentive.  I had a turkey burger which was pretty good.  My wife had a bleu cheese burger with the salad bar add-on, and she liked it.  It wasn't particularly special or unique, but it was good.  You definitely could do worse.  If you have a coupon it's fine for a quick bite.  Join their email club and you get a birthday coupon (free burger)."}
{"text":"All ways order the salad bar as a side- very fresh and well worth it. Their Rib Eye is to die for."}
{"text":"Went as a group with coworkers. Our reserved table was ready and clean when we got there. Virtually no waiting. Server was attentive, friendly and fast. Food ordered came at the same time. The food was decent and decently priced. Nothing to rave about. Will not be loosing any sleep over the flavors. Might be back if invited but will definitely NOT go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"I really go to Ruby Tuesdays for the drinks not the food, so this is where I go after dinner or for a mid day drink. Not implying that there food isn't good I just haven't tried it. The Ruby relax is definitely one of my go to drinks every time I go there. I am not a fan of coconut so I have them add more peach snhapps and substitution of the coconut. My Dessert drink there is the Georgia peach cobbler with whip cream, OMG it's taste like peach ice cream. Danielle my favorite bartender is a sweetheart and definitely knows what she's doing"}
{"text":"This place is in serious need of new Management.  The staff is always super nice and try to be accommodating. I always feel bad for them.   The problem is they have been out of products both times we have ate here. The firsts time they were out of Ribeye's and biscuits of all things. It also took an hour and a half for service. They said due to two people walking out that night.  The second time we ate here they where out of biscuits again. Also cheese, and croutons on the salad bar.   Aside from that the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Very clean! The shrimp fondue was way to salty so our waitress took it off our bill. Unfortunately it the AC was cranked up and the music was kind of loud. Overall the salad bar and the staff are amazing and we are most likely to come back!"}
{"text":"Im 34 years old with an out of state id and they would not serve me, saying the id was 'faded' though new york state ids are never shiny per se. Oh and the foods shit as well."}
{"text":"Soooo...were were suckered in by the multiple TV commercials for their new 55 item salad bar. Upon arrival we noticed that 95% of the salad bar was the same, yes they added hummus and some broccoli and cut up apples and grapes BUT they now also charge you 1.49 if you substitute it for a side when in the last it was free or if you wanted to add it it's now 3.99...multiple people in the location caught on...very misleading! And will not be back"}
{"text":"I had never been to a Ruby Tuesday's outside of Flagstaff Mall and was never impressed with that one.  We ended up here because it appears to be the only actual restaurant inside PV Mall, and it was too hot to walk across the street.  Now, I don't know if the menus vary by restaurants, but this one had a completely different menu than the restaurant in Flag.  Much smaller and much better.  I had an avocado quesadilla.  Now you may think it would be hard to screw that up, but I was prepared for some green crap mildly resembling avocado, but it was actually the real thing.  My husband had the chicken pot pie.  That looked yummy-it was in a bowl of puffed pastry.  He was pleased.  Great salad bar, too.  What stood out was the service.  Excellent.  Would definitely come here again, but probably would still shy away from the chain otherwise."}
{"text":"Pretty good. Nice salad bar. No bread? For the price of everything else there should be bread or some kind of bread to buy. Thought about gluing croutons together but that was too much work."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Ordered a desert and it sat on the end of the bar for over 15 minutes (did I mention it had ice cream)! Comment was \"well no body touched it!\" So low. Last night I was pleased had good service. Guess it depends on who is behind the bar. Tonight not so happy."}
{"text":"Ever seen one of those commercials TV of a restaurant that exists nowhere near where you live? Enter Ruby Tuesday. As a Bay Area resident, I have seen repeats of their commercials on many occasions, especially the one about revamping their image (something about a lamp?). At least I think thats what was one of the commercials.   Anyway, I went to Vegas this past weekend and crashed at a friend's house in the area. Granted the house was half an hour away from the Strip, there was one night where we didn't want to drive all the way there, and so when we discovered this place, it was a no-brainer to try it.   This particular location was rather empty on a Sunday night, but then again its not a heavily populated area. There's a salad bar right when you walk in, and silly me I thought it was free. As a carnivore I tend to ignore salad bars, but if that's your thing, add that onto your tab.   I ordered the Brewmaster burger. Remember, if you order any burger, it comes with unlimited fries. It's like T.G.I. Friday's and Red Robin had a child and bore Ruby Tuesday! They even have some decent strawberry lemonade, with real strawberries. The burger itself, was pretty delicious, and the wheat bun is also a plus. It wasn't drenched in BBQ sauce, and you could taste the hint of beer in the meat.   Another reason why I like this place is.... Leinenkugel's Sunset Wheat on tap! You know I had to get it. Suddenly, Yard House isn't the only franchised place to find this. By the way, if anyone knows where else they carry it in the Bay, please shed some light.   Our waitress was awesome and very attentive, but then again there weren't too many people eating there. What's even more awesome, the bill was split per person and how much food they ordered. Basically, the overall receipt showed how much each person needed to pay. No need for separated checks or the need to write down how much to charge to each card!   I bet you if this franchise was more common in the Bay, I'd give a lower score. Then again its not. Eating a pretty good burger with unlimited fries, enjoying a brewski, and watching the NBA playoffs with some good friends is a wonderful experience.   I still hate this place for showing commercials when they don't have any locations nearby."}
{"text":"I only gave this one star because it wouldn't let me write a review without it:/ it might be a good place but I had a terrible night here. Everything we ordered was cold. And then we ordered dessert and there was A HAIR in it. I'm disgusted but still this is just one persons opinion but like I said . I had. A . TERRIBLE experience.!"}
{"text":"Service was TERRIBLE. Two ladies that helped us looked like they were having the worst day ever. But the food is good. We had my six year old niece with us and she asked for crayons and they were so rude to her! Not going back."}
{"text":"This is probably the worse restaurant experienced I ever had. I walk into this place. I see they have a salad bar which the server who greeted me at the door was very help full answering questions about the menu and very friendly. I decided to seat at the bar. I mean i saw an empty bar. So thought to myself I will get full attention by the blond chick, bartender wearing a jersey. Well not even 30 seconds in that im sitting down about to open a menu. She questioned me. saying are u ready? I said no not yet I just sat down and will go over menu. Her response instantly was - You don't know what you want ?!  Almost screaming with a nasty disgusting attitude.... Well guess what ? With that attitude I lost my appetite. I got up and walked out. On my way out I mentioned to the guy at the main entrance what had happened. He apologized. Looked at the girl. She also noticed that I got up and walked away. She shook her head like she didn't care. Well let me just tell you guys that people go out to restaurants to have an experience. Even if the food was not okay but service was awesome I would come back. In this case i will never come here again and definitely will never recommend to any one. Well maybe yeah to one of my food criticism friends. What a shame ruby. Friday Feb. 17. 1:00pm."}
{"text":"First time here, came for the ribs and salad bar, was seated right away and friendly server Monique took our drink order while we looked over the menu.  Saw they had 3 course deal for $13.99, which included the ribs!  I had the chicken with tomato, lemon butter and balsamic with grilled zucchini, delicious.  Ribs fell of the bone and tasted delicious with crispy fries. Salad bar had lots of selections as well, loved their cilantro lime vinegarette. I had the key lime cheesecake cake with fresh blueberries and cream, very rich, perfect size.  Johan had chocolate cake, ice cream and cream with caramel sauce and Oreo crumbles. Why not 5 stars?  Salad bar was not replenished during our visit, still open a few more hours."}
{"text":"Where to start?  Usually one starts with the appetizer, however that arrived after the entrees did.  Drinks--Ordered drinks and waited and waited. Rolls--had to ask twice for rolls. They had not even put any in the oven yet. Salad Bar--No tomatoes and no cucumber.  They had only been open for 30 minutes when we got there!  Broccoli Cheddar soup--If you want the recipe, I think it is Cheez Whiz and chunks of broccoli. Grease--Both the app and the rolls were drenched in grease.  The strawberry lemonade is worth the trip.  But I would seriously eat somewhere else and grab one to go on the the way home. If you decide to throw caution to the wind, consider yourself warned. And stop reading reviews because you don't want the advice."}
{"text":"A co-worker and I went here yesterday for lunch on a business trip to Charlotte. Our server Kelly was stingy with the tiny biscuits they serve and only brought us 2 biscuits to share for 2 people.  The biscuits are good but are literally the size of one bite. Other servers were serving 2 biscuits per person to their tables. I had the petite shrimp plate with asparagus and mashed potatoes. The food was good but I felt a little ripped off about being charged extra for asparagus since the plate does come with 2 sides. There were maybe 5 small spears of asparagus on my plate. Our drinks were refilled promptly and that was good. Oh, I also think that $3.50 is too much to pay for a raspberry lemonade."}
{"text":"I had dinner with my parents here and loved the food. The small biscuits to start us off were really tasty. My dad had the bourbon salmon, my mom had the coastal trio, and I had the baked ravioli. I tried a bit of everyone's dishes and thought the bourbon salmon was spot on. The bourbon sauce was sweet and slightly spicy, and the salmon itself was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The coastal trio came with tilapia and lobster, which were both tender. I wasn't a fan of the ravioli, as there was an overwhelming amount of cheese. I quickly filled up on the cheese and marinara sauce without really enjoying the ravioli itself. Wish I had gotten the bourbon salmon for myself!  Just a few months ago at Ruby Tuesday you could go to the unlimited salad bar as one of your sides. Unfortunately, now the salad bar is not offered as a side; you have to pay $3.99 separately, which was a bit annoying. The salad bar itself is very fresh though.  I was also dismayed that some of the wood panels on the walls of the restaurant were coming off. We were seated by a window where a panel had literally fallen off and was on the ground by my feet. A couple other panels looked like they were about to fall.  The food was on the pricey side, but that was to be expected with seafood. The salad bar fees also added up. Overall though, the food quality and service were great."}
{"text":"Awful in every way. They are rather good at being terrible. No service and actively ignored. The bartender was talking to her friend and walked by me 5 times and 10 minutes. You guys suck really"}
{"text":"Shout out to managers Alex and Logan! not sure if you remember us but me and my wife Megan met you and some of your servers in Las Vegas last summer. There was a lot of booze involved so we won't be offended if you don't remember. Haha. Anyways we did end up moving to the Chandler area a couple of months ago and thought i'd stop by to say hi and see how things are going. Didn't see either of you in there so i didn't stay very long. Would love to catch up and have drinks with you and your staff again. Don't know too many people in the area yet. Hopefully will catch you next time. -Jon"}
{"text":"We were staying next door at the Hilton Garden Inn and conveniently located across the parking lot is Ruby Tuesday's. I needed dinner so I used there to-go service and I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered the petite sirloin with mashed potatoes and white cheddar Mac n cheese. I added their new advertised salad bar for an additional  $3.99. When I went to pick it up, my hot food was in a bag and they handed me a large container for the salad bar. It was decent with different types of lettuce, a large assortment of veggies and toppings and some cold pasta and potato salad. The steak was cooked perfectly and the sides tasted great. I will definitely order again :)"}
{"text":"If not for the curteous and very professional bar tender . . . I would have most likely gotten up and left.  It's been years since I've been in an establishment ran under such lax prefessionalism.  To start, I walk in to the host standing at the front desk with his hands down the front of his pants, almost to the elbows tucking in his pants.  As I order I watch several employees drinking at the bar and placing their cups around on teb back side of the bar to pick up often, granted I am sure they were only soda, but this behavior was never acceptable at any establishment I've owned or worked at in my youth.  I then get to watch one of the lead, I guess waiters as he was wearing a red shirt, rubbing up against and kissing on a young red headed waitress, as both stood at the bar, in plain view of the customers.  The most surprising part, is that the Manager was walking to for and talking to all of these individuals the whole time, not like he wasn't aware of the behavior.  Times have really changed"}
{"text":"I am not much for chain restaurants but came here on a business lunch.  I asked the server for the california turkey wrap, she wrote it down proceeded to move on and then stated \"do you still want this, we do not have avocado\", that is the whole purpose of the wrap.  I ended up getting the salmon Caesar wrap which was delicious.  The service was pretty good but we were about the only table occupied as they opened at 11 and we should up at 11:30.  I would go back for another business lunch here."}
{"text":"I love their salad bar! So very fresh! I was not in love with the new shrimp trio. The fried shrimp was the best. I know it's silly, but the Mr pibb is also very good. A well balanced mix of soda water and syrup."}
{"text":"I love going here because the staff is very friendly, and they recognize me when I walk in! They welcome me back, and chat a little.  I love the peach iced tea.  I sit in the bar area, and the service is always excellent.  The salad bar is clean and they fill it regularly.  The food does not always come out the way you would want (raw fish, or missing some part of the meal), but if I tell them, they are very apologetic and make sure that it is right.    For lunch (and dinner) they have reasonably-priced combos - two sliders, fries (or a side) and the salad bar.  You can also get a piece of meat (such as chicken or fish) with a side (say, mashed potatoes) and the salad bar.  The salad bar is unlimited, so you can fill up on the good stuff.   My experience may be different because I go at least once a week.  I need to unwind, and I can sit there, drink tea, eat, read, watch TV, or play games on my cellphone without a lot of interruptions.  I would give them 5 stars, but problems with the food stop me from doing that.  I had to send back grilled chicken a couple of times because the sauce was too heavy or there was just too much seasoning(too spicy for grilled chicken).  The last hamburger that I had was very \"grissly\", and it was supposed to be a bacon cheeseburger, but they forgot the bacon.  Once, I got raw salmon. They fix the problem, and the cook usually says \"oops!\"  I admit that the quality of the food could be improved.  A drink and the salad bar is a good combo."}
{"text":"The food was good and our service from Brando was great! I would like to give 5 stars, but as I entered they have a sign for happy hour for  $2 draft beer. As we sat down our server stated that it only applies at the bar. This is the first for me."}
{"text":"Stopped by for the advertised $13.99 three course meal. Choice of chicken fresco, 1/2 rack of ribs or petite sirloin with one side, unlimited salad bar and choose from 2 desserts. I chose the chicken fresco with mashed potatoes which was delicious. I loved the salad bar.....everything was fresh and there was a good amount to choose from. The chocolate cake was very good too. Service was excellent! I wish they more locations in the Vegas/Henderson area but will return."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to a nice meal after a long day on the road. I definitely chose the wrong restaurant for a nice meal. I ordered the Bourbon Pork Chop and Salad Bar. The meal arrived very quick and after cutting the chop I knew why. I took the first bite and found an ice cold piece of pork. I felt the center of the chop and it was refrigerator cold. The mashed potatoes (dark brown) and green beans were very hot. I suspect they were microwaved prior to coming out. The manager offered a replacement but I chose to stick with the salad. There are many restaurants in the area, I would suggest avoiding this one."}
{"text":"I took my family here for dinner about a week ago. The one thing I was disappointed with is their salad bar selection. I used to frequent Ruby Tuesday's years ago and their selection was larger. However, I guess since their salad bar selection is smaller, they offer more food menu items. I ordered the flavored iced tea and I was impressed that the server mixes it up for me in person. I also love the shrimp dip appetizer. I ordered the chicken broccoli. It was delicious. I know next time to have my sons split a food dish instead of getting their own. Our server was prompt and polite. We left there stuffed."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for happy hour with a friend after work. Service was very slow. Martini on rocks had too much vermouth. Appetizer took almost 30 minutes to arrive...no they were not busy. Food was OK but the service and drinks were bad and over priced."}
{"text":"I have to agree with some of the other reviews, I was not impressed by the new and improved garden bar.  Same old garden bar and I think they have less choices than before the so called changes. I haven't been to a Ruby Tuesday and years because the crab cakes were thinner than pancakes with hardly any crab and the biscuits were the size of quarters. Guess what, nothing's changed. I've seen McDonald's chicken nuggets larger than those tiny biscuits. A toddler would like at those biscuits sideways. I only went b/c they keep sending out the coupons. The only good thing I can say is the Bourbon chicken was moist. Our waiter Donnie was nice and personable."}
{"text":"Against my better judgement I ignored the reviews and gave this Rudy Tuesday's a try last night with 4 of my girls. READ THE REVIEWS, they are RIGHT!!! Are time was horrible. Are waiter was new and that's ok. Except he found it more important to fold napkins then getting our food and drinks. It took over 20 minutes just to get our waters we order and they NEVER were refilled. Our food took forever and we got our appetizer after we were all done and had to remind him. Thank goodness most of us just got the salad bar. That was even under par, wilted lettuce and maybe 5 toppings. Bottom line it was terrible. I spoke to the manager who I thought would actually do something but he didn't. I am all for helping a new guy out but goodness have him train with someone until he knows how to do his job. I will NEVER go back to this location and please don't waste your time or money here. :( I also need to add the salad bar plates were filthy, I went through at least 5 plates just to find one that was remotely clean."}
{"text":"Extremely slow service. Ambience was nice and it was very clean. Food was good. Just takes a long time."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and good pricing. Every time I go the food is average to above average.  Eating in the bar is definitely the way to go. You get an extremely attentive server and fast service. It's a great place to unwind on a Friday evening."}
{"text":"Inconsistently BORING with mediocre service.  The Salad Bar used to be a reason for going to RT, today not so much.  Although fresh and nicely kept, most of the \"premium\" ingredients have been taken off the salad bar as they have obviously dumbed it down to increase their profit margin.  And their dessert menu pictures are to die for but the reality, disappointing!  DESCRIPTION:  Apple Crumble Flatbread - Juicy, fire-roasted Fuji apples atop a crispy flatbread, sprinkled with oatmeal crumble, sweet caramel, and powdered sugar. Served with vanilla bean ice cream.  REALITY:  A HOT MESS!  Dry, very few apple pieces, overcooked flatbread, a little caramel drizzle and even less powdered sugar.  Thank goodness for the vanilla bean ice cream!  An overpriced below average dining experience, not going back anytime soon . . ."}
{"text":"Excellent Service . Waiter was awesome! Very polite and attentive didn't have to wait long for dinner . The salad bar is great try."}
{"text":"Not bad for a national chain type restaurant. I don't frequent these types of places too often and I only find myself here when my taste buds are in a generic mood, and can't seem to pinpoint exactly what they want.   They have great specialty drinks that start at only $5. Their salad bar is always stocked with only the freshest ingredients. The quality of the food is very good and pricing is just right. I've never had a steak that was cooked at the wrong temperature and service is always friendly and efficient. I liked that the hostess took my drink order when I told her I was going to the restroom before sitting down. A simple gesture like that is very much appreciated. My drink was ready for me when I got back to the table.  They must be doing something right because they are one of the few remaining restaurants on Craig Rd that hasn't closed down in the last five years. They are definitely above average for a national chain family restaurant. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"I know I sound like I am 80yrs old but I love Ruby Tuesday's. I have had BBQ ribs at almost every resaurant that has ribs and shockingly Ruby Tuesdays has the best I have ever had. You probably think I am kidding but Im not. Their mini burgers are also great, the salad bar is simple but good, my wife likes it. Their potato salad is good. I like this location out of all the ones I have been to, is is generic like previous reviewer but good food, which is really important."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of RT. Their salad bar is always fresh and offers a good variety. On my most recent visit, our server, Debbie was extremely friendly and efficient. She was at the table quickly to take drink orders. When the drinks arrived, they were accompanied by warm little bisquits that were outstanding and complimentary, or included in the price of the meals . Either way you look at it, they are a must have. You won't be disappointed. I chose the Ruby's Mini's with the salad bar. Cooked to order sliders with endless french fries and a bottomless salad. Everything was fresh and flavorful. A great meal at a good price. I opted for the peach iced tea this time, which was refreshing and full of flavor. The tea was a little pricey at $3.99, but was very good and did come with refills. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It was okay...I had the salad bar and a burger with fries cause I am a creature of habit and it's REALLY  REALLY hard to mess up a burger and they didn't do that so win win!  It's not a Whities or GLB or Harp...It's a national chain so I would believe the food is pretty cookie cutter but good... So there!"}
{"text":"Standard fare. The food was good. Decent salad bar. I would say it is in line with Applebee's or Chili's, but not as greasy as chili's.   What set it apart was the outstanding service we received. The waitress was attentive and on point."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at Ruby Tuesday Saturday night for an early Mother's Day. Even though the line was out the door we got immediate seating because we had reservations. The service was still good even though they were busy. My wife tried the seafood treo, which she loved.. I tried the new Mahi Mahi and had them blacken it. I loved it. We love the ambiance, food, and service at this Ruby Tuesdays. We keep going back because we know we can depend on them for a good meal, a good value, and good service."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and it was wonderful! Our server, Jessica was on top of things the whole time! The steaks came out fresh off the grill and super tasteful! Salad bar was clean and fresh! Will be returning more often!"}
{"text":"Happy hour appetizer Shrimp was ok nothing special about it - the beer was $8.00 for one beer! They wouldn't let us get a turkey burger instead of a cheese burger on their happy hour. Bar Tender was friendly but other than that...."}
{"text":"Had the petite blackened tilapia with baked Mac and cheese and salad bar. Food was sub par. The experience was not memorable, except for the people I was with."}
{"text":"What happened to the great Ruby Tuesdays of the past?!  We used to go to the bar after work and get the salad bar too.  What a mess the salad bar is now, not full, not cold, no cold plates.  They need to get new management in there now or this place will go under!"}
{"text":"The three stars is just for the food.  It's just commercial food.  Meaning it feels like just average, except their heavy cheesecake.  Yum!   Now let's talk about the best part of this chain restaurant.  The staff.  Helpful, honest, don't interrupt when your eating.  The two that stand out the most was Lindsi and an Irish waitress/bar tender.  So nice.  Made us happy we stopped by and had dinner."}
{"text":"So today we decided to go here to celebrate my sister's birthday. We went in and they had a table very shortly, not that long of a wait at all. The place gave me a very cozy comfortable feelings . They had a nice section for salads and salad's dressing of your choice, as much as u like and as many items on the salad as u want. And i must say, the ribs were on point!! That thing just melted in your mouth. Would totally be coming back here:)"}
{"text":"Skip it. The manager was very polite about addressing our concerns so I'm not going to bash them. However, we went in for lunch, it was very slow only 2 other tables. And the cleanliness of the restaurant was unacceptable."}
{"text":"Only eat at Ruby Tuesdays for the Petite Sirloin with mashed potatoes and fries! Service is usually pretty good but it depends on the waiter/waitress. This location is fairly close to ASU so expect to be served by a college student who's beginning to learn the ropes. Overall, Ruby Tuesdays is a monthly restaurant for me and have a great atmosphere for dining with family and friends."}
{"text":"So yummy. Always good food and great service.  You can't beat their steak prices. Amazing salad bar. I always get a big salad then save my dinner for left overs."}
{"text":"Poor customer service from waiter, hostess and manager. Prices were wrong. No customer retention. Dry chicken and over cooked food. Will never return. Not recommended."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with a friend a couple of weeks ago.  I hadn't been to this restaurant in at least 5 years and I was really surprised at the changes to the menu. I came in thinking this was mostly a burger place but the choices for healthy sides & entrees they offer is really impressive!  I was able to order salmon with mashed cauliflower & steamed green beans for under 450 calories.  And because all the healthy substitutions are listed as options on the menu, you don't feel like \"that girl\" requesting no butter or substituting salad for fries.  If you're dieting or just a healthy eater, I highly recommend Ruby Tuesday for their wide variety of tasty, low cal options.  Of course if you're a regular eater, they have plenty of tempting steaks & burgers, too."}
{"text":"Just had lunch there today and enjoyed the visit. Had their salmon and sides and everything was very nice! Waiter was there when needed. We will return!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Clean, plain, classy, modern, dimly lit, quiet, slow-paced.  Burger: Savory, thick, flavorful, free (birthday).  Fries: Nothing special.  Service: Average  Overall: A pretty delicious main entree, with an unremarkable side, and okay service. The free birthday burger is a nice gesture on the company's part."}
{"text":"Stop did not receive our credit card back scam  Try to Ruby Tuesday's for the second time food was far better than the first time however service still was horrible we gave the waitress or debit card to pay for our bill waitress did not return our credit card manager said it happens sometimes and was unable to provide our card back do not eat here they are probably running a credit card scam"}
{"text":"We dined there today at 3:45 and had an interesting time, from trying to flag down the waiter three or four times to watching someone get caught for walking out on their steak and lobster bill.   I ordered a cheese and bacon burger, well done, and got a cheese burger, medium well (a little pink). I had to try to get the waiter's attention to come back and fix it (put bacon on it); by that time my husband was halfway through his burger. The fries he had and the onion rings I had were okay, but not up to the standards we've come to enjoy at Red Robin.   There were only a couple dozen people in the place, so it was very quiet, but it wasn't easy to get anyone's attention to get our soft drinks refilled or anything else. I had to ask twice for an extra napkin. It wasn't like the wait staff were run ragged by a huge, noisy crowd. They were, however, extremely professional, nice, personable, and did a great job when you could get their attention.   The atmosphere was considerably more upscale and \"adult\" than, say, Red Robin, which is set up for fun and families; RT seems like a place you'd bring a colleague or business prospect for a quiet lunch of burgers or steak. The prices were \"reasonable\" to \"a bit high\"; our burgers & fries were $8.99 (fair price), the peach-flavored ice tea was $3.49 (too high, in my opinion). I liked the thick, meaty taste and texture of the burgers. They were huge, too big for either of us to finish at the restaurant. I asked for BBQ sauce on the side; I should have tasted it before pouring it on my burger, because it tasted strongly of vinegar, not typical of the sugar-tomato-based BBQ sauce I prefer.   Comparing RT to Red Robin, Outback, and TGI Friday's, all of which we frequent, I don't think it stacked up very well. We went because we had a coupon for a free burger, but even with another freebie, I don't know if we'll go back."}
{"text":"The server was so very nice very attentive to our needs. The food was what I expected. I am a vegetarian so I was excited they had baked potatoes. My dates dinner was better than he thought it was to be a expected. It was a friendly family atmosphere.   I cannot complain. I would go back for a dinner for sure."}
{"text":"Not a big fan of this Ruby Tuesdays. Every time I go in to set at the bar there is a new bartender and they don't know how to make drinks. Even simple ones like a jack and coke. It's crazy. The food is so so. When I ordered a rare steak in came out well done, I guess this is why it took 30 mins. Manager never came around to check on the other steak they cooked for me that came out about med. By this time I just didn't care and ate it. Biscuits were hard. Just an overall bad experience."}
{"text":"Love this location. Consistent service and tasty eats. The Indepndence location is great since it's convenient to all major highways and nearby businesses.  I had the ruby minis, which came with fries and the salad bar - which may be my reason for the three stars. If it weren't for their low prices and amazing salad bar' they'd get a two. The homemade pumpernickel croutons are legendary people, and the salad bar boasts everything from fruits to pasta. I'm in love!    The lobster Mac n chess is sooooo good and the lobster meat actually tastes fresh....which is sup rising for a chain.    This is definitely a family-friendly establishment since it's a chain, so for singles I would suggest going to happy hour since they offer half off on some of their apps and their drinks are wonderful...or go during lunch. No screaming babies usually at those times.   Yes, Yelpers  I am definitely a fan!!!"}
{"text":"Ruby Tuesday is a great restaurant. They keep it simple with the traditional American food: burgers, pasta, salad...etc.  Their food is pretty good, it will leave you satisfied and feeling good about choosing to eat there. They have many meals to choose from and all at a decent price. (I sound like a spokesperson)  Really great, simple place, and I love it."}
{"text":"Very, very ordinary. The salad bar (which is kind of supposed to be their signature thing) isn't really all that impressive - just your basic salad items. Nothing that really stands out. The burgers are good (which is to say \"not bad\") but not memorable. Red Robin is a couple of doors down if you're looking for a place that specializes more in burgers.  I thought I'd try the pork chop since nothing else was really grabbing me but they were out of the hickory glaze (since the night before!) so the only option would have been a plain pork chop at the same price. Expecting it to be utterly without flavor I opted for the burger."}
{"text":"Our server made an extremely racist comment. While I can't blame the restaurant, as it was obviously due to her upbringing, there needs to some sort of training for what is appropriate and what isn't when serving guests.  The MOD was informed of this but never even stopped back at our table to check in."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere, manager is very friendly and thoughtful, great tasting food and when using their coupons - that you can always find online... Great value."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this restaurant. Food was salty and  over cooked. Our server was not attentive and seemed annoyed having to be there."}
{"text":"My husband and I are frequent diners at this location.  Service and food is always excellent.  Staff always greets us at the door upon arriving and leaving restaurant. We had dinner tonight no greeters coming or going.  My husband ordered petite steak with salad and mashed potatoes.  He received  zucchini ilo of mashed potatoes.  I ordered the petite steak (medium rare) mashed potatoes and zucchini.  My steak was way over cooked (dry)  and the zucchini was soggy and overcooked.  Normally zucchini is grilled and very tasty.  Waitress seemed rushed.  Menus were never removed from table.  Temperature is restaurant was extremely warm.  My husband and I both were very uncomfortable.  Not so sure if we will return!"}
{"text":"Have to give them one star as the food was inedible.  I got a steak to go with a side of veggies.  I couldn't cut through the steak at all with all the fat and connective tissue so I couldn't eat it.  The zucchini was blackened with the dirty, left over grill pieces or prior burnt food, couldn't eat that either.  To top it all off, it was 17$ for a disgusting plate of food.  If I had eaten there I would've sent it back and left but instead I got jacked for $20.  The people who worked there were nice but the food wasn't edible. 1 star. Never again will I come here."}
{"text":"This is the last time we'll visit this RT. Service was soooo slow. No one there to greet us at the door for at least 5 minutes. Ordered the Avocado grilled chicken sandwich. It arrived without any avocado. They came back and said oops.. we're out of avocado. Manager offered to comp the meal, but we already had a bogo coupon, although they should've still taken off the sandwich rather than the cheapest meal. Not a very pleasant experience, although the salad bar is good."}
{"text":"I live down the road from it and it's the closest place to still offer a salad bar. The salad bar is great and you can get it for a reasonable price as a side item along with your main course.    The menu prices are very reasonable and the service is good. The quality of the food is as expected for a typical mid priced national chain, not great but not by either."}
{"text":"I don't get these rating at all. You really go to a restaurant for the look! Wtf is wrong you comparing RT to McDonald's sad. RT at least has customer service and it's your good at that  I go to the RT on market often, with my family and I love this play not much to the inside low lighting and a bar. I like to mix up what I get but I really love the unique sides they have fresh and healthy. I was on a diet and had tons of options. My favourite is chicken fresco with grilled zucchini and salad bar.   And the cheddar biscuits are amazing but really small."}
{"text":"After living in Jacksonville, FL for a couple years, I have grown to love Ruby Tuesdays.  They were everywhere in Florida so when I moved here I was a little disappointed that they did not have one close to where I live.  I live in the Southwest area so it is a drive for me and my husband to go to the north side of town.  We had a coupon so why not right?  This was our second trip there.  We were seated immediately which was great.  I noticed that the place wasn't even busy so I thought great we don't have to wait long for our food.  My husband and I waited a while for someone to ask us for our drinks.  I noticed around that there were a lot of servers cleaning the tables so I was a little confused why it took so long for someone to get to us.  Someone finally came and took our drink.  My husband and I always get the New Orleans seafood.    We got our food and I have to admit it was so good.  I loved it.  I can't complain.  If that is one thing that annoys me is if my drink is not filled.  I am usually patient when it comes to servers because I know that they are busy, however this place was not busy at all.  Our server came to check on us once and did not even bother to get us a refill.  I noticed that our server actually went to another table and was having a chat with them while my husband and I were sitting waiting for our drinks to get refilled which is a good 10 minutes.  I ended up having to get someone else to get our drinks.    We finished our food at this point after we finished our drinks.  We were still waiting for her to even give us our check which by the way she never came to give us.  She never did.  We both had to get up and find someone so we can pay our bill.  I mean this is ridiculous.  We should never have to wait for them.  We are giving these people our business.    So pretty much we drove 30 miles for us to get bad service with good food.  I was wondering whether or not I do want to come back because the service was just that horrible.  I am glad that other people had a great experience, but we didn't."}
{"text":"I ordered the appetizer sampler along with the salad bar.  The appetizer sampler was HUGE!  It was hot and crispy and the dips were excellent as well.  Their endless garden bar the lettuce was crisp and fresh and all the additives were very freshly sliced or diced and plent of it.  They had several different dressings to choose from.  Val and I shared the pineapple upside down cake.  OMG it was delicious!  Server was on point, attentive, kept our glasses full and checked on us.  Would go again."}
{"text":"I enjoy Ruby Tuesday's. They have some really good menu items at fair prices. The service I have received us generally very good.  I have been to this restaurant more times than I can remember as I live down the street and work nearby as well."}
{"text":"This was our first time here. We started with the spinach and artichoke dip and it was creamy and perfect. The salad bar was tasty. I liked the variety of things available - veggies, fruits, other kinds of salads. The chicken dish I had was tasty and the burger and fries my son had was really good. Everything was cooked beautifully. I had a peach tea that actually had fresh peaches in it.   The service was outstanding! We had Nate and he was very attentive and kept our drinks filled."}
{"text":"Me and my wife went for supper Saturday  .we each got the fish with lobster. When we got our food the fish was not raw but even worse it was not cook. We sent it back. The manager came over and said we could have salad bar on the house while we wait for our food. I don't think that was enough for what my wife went through that night. She had stomach pains all night .I will not be back"}
{"text":"This was a huge disappointment.  There were very few people here, yet it took more than 45 minutes to get a kids Mac and cheese and two orders of chicken fingers.  When the food finally came, the order was incorrect and the tenders over cooked.  We ended up eating an over cooked baked potato after waiting over an hour.  When we tried to salvage the meal by ordering a dessert for the child in the party-they were out.  The manager did remove the uneaten chicken from the bill, however we paid for the child's meal (that also was incomplete when served) and drink.  I would not choose this location again."}
{"text":"For the price you may expect more but this is nothing more than your average american chain restaurant. Just ok."}
{"text":"Good meal. The steak was good. The homemade mac and cheese was a big hit for my 3 kids. The salad bar was good, clean and well stocked. Service was good but slow. We called ahead and reserved a table for 6."}
{"text":"This was the single worst dining experience I have ever had. No exaggeration. The. Worst. It should have negative stars.   We walked in to find nobody at the host station. The restaraunt was about half full. After about 5 minutes, someone finally noticed us (after a few servers had already walked by without greeting us) and came to seat us.   15 minutes later, I had to stop the same guy who seated us (maybe an assistant manager, he had a button down shirt on instead of the server's uniform.) and ask if we were going to get served, as we had not seen a server yet. I also asked him for drinks, since we hadn't even been given water yet.   (We should have walked out at that point, but for some reason, we stayed. Big mistake.)  Our server finally came over, and we ordered our food. it took 30 minutes to get a hamburger (which came well done instead of medium well as ordered) and a fried shrimp plate.) The french fries were dry as a bone in the desert, and tasted old. When I asked for ketchup when the server brought the food, she never brought it, and on her next swing by (about 10 more minutes) I had to ask again.   The only thing that made it to our table at a reasonable time was the check."}
{"text":"It just wasn't that good. Sorry, just thought for what I was paying it would have tasted better. Might as well have gone to Burger King."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times for the burger with the pretzel bread bun, which is really good."}
{"text":"The food was horrible, soaked in grease, the salad bar was not fresh.  Just not a good experience."}
{"text":"Not coming back to this one. Went in 2 nights ago. We went for the  new salad bar. It was filthy and not stocked. We asked our server, Ben and he said they would get right on it. They didn't. Two other customers were saying the same thing and the hostess explained that it was unattended because they were slow. Really? So I get to pay the same price for a filthy, unstocked salad bar when they are slow, as I do for a clean well stocked bar when they are busy. Ben was great but only one person. To be fair, he did take one off our bill. Still not going back."}
{"text":"Into any given set of meals, a few chains must fall, luckily Ruby Tuesday is a better one than average.  The food is good quality, better than other chains and I like that they have a salad bar.    Everyone got the Ruby Mini Combo with the salad bar.  You get 2 small slider burgers that are garnished with cheese, pickle and a small piece of onion ring on toasted rolls.  I don't believe the description said they came with cheese, so if you don't like cheese make sure to order it without.  The burgers were good and tasty as were the accompanying fries.    I really liked the salad bar.    The salad bar was constantly being restocked with fresh ingredients and there was a good variety of items and I didn't encounter any produce that was starting to go bad, which is sometimes the case with chains and their produce.  At $8.99 these was a good value lunch as well, vecause you could go backt o the salad bar and much as you wanted.    The biggest sin Ruby Tuesday is guilty of is they instruct their servers to be touchy-feely.  By that I mean, they bend down when they talk to you so that they are at eye-level, make sure they tell you their names, they make chit chat about their lives in order to get a bigger tip.  Our server brought complimentary birthday sundaes to the group of ladies to our right, which elicited a big round of \"OOOOhs\" from the tape and I'm sure a bigger tip.  But if that is the biggest thing they do wrong, I'll deal with it."}
{"text":"I'm going to start off by saying that I've honestly had frozen meals that've tasted better. That surprisingly is not the worst part. I paid a total of $20.35 for my order. However the charge on my credit card is $26.35. It's just $6 so I'm not going to make a issue out of it but please be vigilant.  I ordered carry out via their online service around 6.15 pm and got the confirmation that it'll be ready in 20 mins reached there after 30 mins and was made to wait additional 20 mins before being handed over food by a pretty rude server. Yes it was a busy weekday however that's no excuse for an order taking 50 mins. There's a reason I ordered online. Change your settings and don't tell people to come in 20 mins if you're going to take an hour.  I live a street across from this place, less than a two minute drive however by the time I got home my food was cold so they basically gave me cold food. To the extent that mashed potatoes tasted like I was eating a stick of solid butter. I'm being generous by giving two stars."}
{"text":"Oh my god, they closed the ruby tuesday near my house and i was a sad panda. Came to vegas for my bday and found one here. Words cannot describe how happy i was. So, onto the review.  -Triple prime burger HAS to be ordered medium rare or rare.  The taste of the meat is way off if cooked more than medium rare.  Send the bitch back if you have to.  Juice should be dripping out of this bad boy. -get the fire wings hot -try their flavored teas. Peach tea is my favorite. Their mixed drinks are also very well made, Almost everything I have ordered from this restaurant was good, if not great.  I had my burger cooked medium and politely sent it back for a medium rare, and yes, the difference from medium rare to medium really does have an effect on the taste.   Fire wings are delicious and like the great restaurant they are, the wings come with...BLUE CHEESE dressing, bitches!  Fuck ranch! Well, I do like ranch, but blue cheese owns.  This isn't your crappy runny or too thick blue cheese either, it tastes really good.  Even if you're not a big fan, it'll make you one! Peach Tea...NOM NOM NOM, orgasm in my mouf!  Anyway, check this place out, I do get bummed out thinking about how I can no longer come here anytime I want :("}
{"text":"This restaurant is a bit of an oasis on the Streetsboro trip. Think healthy, well prepared food with decent choices. Nice salad bar itch fresh items. Great place to go for lunch. Only knock is service was a bit slow"}
{"text":"So, I generally like this chain, since it tends to offer a healthy menu.  This location does have a nice, fresh salad bar.  The menu is pretty standard, with some healthier choices.  Service is a bit slow.  Drinks from the bar seem like they are from mixes.  Not my favorite location."}
{"text":"Ruby Tuesday is a solid American fare restaurant where you can get a meal that plays it safe typically under $10; get the salad bar.  Yes this is a chain restaurant that your parents & grandparents would probably enjoy, however their service is typically good, you can almost always get coupons via email and their salad bar is consistently good and well kept.  The salad bar is probably the differentiator for RT, many entrees come with it, $2.99 add on if not, but if you want just the salad bar, get an entree that comes with it like the Baja chicken tacos for just a couple dollars more.  Spring mix & iceburg lettuces, fresh broccoli / bacon salad, fruit salad, potato salad and fresh croutons are a few highlights.  Ruby Tuesday seemed to simplify their menu and slowly move to more bar fare with their addition of new chicken fingers and removal of spaghetti squash and zucchini minis (now I have to make them at home).  Don't expect to be blown away, but have a solid meal with a salad bar if you're up for it."}
{"text":"I was concerned about previous yelp reviews but RT was near my hotel. I was pleasantly surprised that food and service were excellent! My bacon cheddar burger was perfectly cooked, moist and delicious! Fries were excellent. My partner's ribs were tender and well seasoned. Our server was prompt, nice and attentive. If I lived nearby, I would be back next week! Worth a trip!"}
{"text":"Nothing really special about the place.Food and service was alright!Wouldn't go there again!"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave one star is because zero stars was not an option. I called in an order tonight and everything was a disaster. First, I was rudely put on hold for more than EIGHT minutes. I finally gave up and called back. The second time I called, the phone rang in excess of 12 times before someone finally picked up.  The order was not ready when I arrived at the scheduled time. After waiting five more minutes before finally getting the food, I started to leave before realizing that they didn't give me the appetizer I ordered. I then had to wait another 5-6 minutes for them to make the appetizer. When I got pack to our hotel room, I realized  that they had not given me the side that was supposed to come with my sandwich and had only given my wife one of the sides she ordered. At this point, I gave up because I did not want to drive back to the restaurant again to get two sides. The food, by the way, was poor quality and lukewarm. Probably because it sat so long while they made the appetizer they missed. All in all, this was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have had in years."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend go to here at least once a month we enjoy the food and like the clean atmosphere and great service. Their food is just okay but still delicious"}
{"text":"I love their pretzel bun burgers and great salad bar, but service is soooo slow. I have typically gone for carry-outs and even when there is hardly no one in the restaurant there is still quite a wait. I have even called ahead/placed order online on a couple of occasions and still have had to wait almost as long a when I just walk in and place an order."}
{"text":"I'm rating RT a 5* simply for the memories. I haven't been to the place in over 10-15 years but when I was growing up on the east coast, that was the only spot (other than TGIF's) that my posse and I could go to. I remember we'd always get the same things: broccoli and cheese soup, loads of the queso dip with chips and my favorite, Sonora chicken pasta (because the sauce tastes the same as the queso dip). My sis and I were just talking about it tonight and will swing by next week, even though it is 30 min out of our way. I want to stuff my face with the queso and the pasta. Ruby Tuesdays, you BETTAH have that Sonora pasta.   Other than my cheese filled memories, I don't know anything else about RT's menu. You'll just have to make those memories for yourself.   Weee!!"}
{"text":"We have always had good quality food and hearty portions here. I enjoy the flatbread pizza as an entree. They just improved the salad bar which is better than most.  The service has always been very good.  This location is rarely as busy as the restaurants close by and is a great alternative."}
{"text":"Once in a blue moon i will hit a chain restaurant, and  usually i am disappointed. This was no exception.  Lets smart off by the appearance o the restaurant. It was just dingy did not look clean. Streaks on mirrors etc...   So I pretty much was in the mood for salad and that is the one positive thing about the meal. The salad bar was well stocked ,fresh and very tasty.  The bar tender did not bring my any biscuits ,r what ever that are supposed to bring.  I did not know till my mom asked me what I thought about the biscuits. I was like never got them. I  ordered a  chicken  breast dinner.  About 13$ with 2 sides.  They gave my what amounted to half a chicken breast ,a bout what should be put on a sandwich.  Not worth  13$   I also ordered green been and zuchini.  The gave about 12 green beans and even less zucchini. Now  If i would have  ordered fries, I am sure I would have  received a heaping ration. This is what I hate about chains  if you try to be the least bit healthy your most likely going to walk  away hungry.  This was not worth 15$ but I should have have known this would be the end result."}
{"text":"Service good, a little pricey and the quality of the food wasn't what I expected. Don't think I will be heading back for seconds."}
{"text":"Saturday night's gonna be alright at Ruby Tuesdays!  This was proven last weekend when hubby and I met two other couples here for a birthday dinner.    My girlfriends and I.. well.. we can get a bit raucous.  We make each other laugh.. loudly.  I often forget there are other patrons in the place, but Ruby Tuesdays seems to be one of those restaurants you can laugh freely in and have a good time.  Jana was our server on this particular evening and she helped make the experience memorable.  When we would ask questions or ask her to help us make a decision, she didn't hesitate.  She was friendly, personable, and truly adorable.  It seemed that just when we would think of something we needed (extra napkins, water refill, plates for appetizers, etc.), she would come around the corner with that very thing.  This was my fourth time dining at this location and the fourth time I was impressed by the service and food (that shrimp fondue is heaven!) and that salad bar!.. and they had a fun retro pop-rock mix playing over the sound system Saturday night that kept us entertained.   As if our laughter wasn't enough."}
{"text":"Salad bar and drinks were boss but the appetizers were awful. I liked the peach martini. Service was quick and friendly. Would come again for the salad bar."}
{"text":"Not attentive. Ate my food without a drink and when she finally brought it to the table my dinner was done. Food not up to par."}
{"text":"Yesterday my daughter and I went here for lunch. The quesadillas were deep fried and didn't taste good at all. My daughter's chicken fingers were bland and she barely ate them. She was excited to get the caramel blondie brownie for desert. It tasted like a cocoa powder. Very much a disappointment. While driving home, we still had that taste in our mouth. We definitely will not come back."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly service and atmosphere. Good portions, reasonably priced and a salad bar too! Ordered a cobb chicken salad. The plate was large, and filled with crunchy chicken bites and generous toppings. Enough to feed a minimum of 2 ppl. easy!"}
{"text":"Came here for my bday lunch with my hubby.  The staff was super friendly.  Our server was the BOMB, but he just spoke so softly it was hard to hear him!  He was super attentive (like he was reading our minds).  We both ordered the:  Triple Prime Bacon Cheddar Burger (with aged New York cheddar and applewood smoked bacon) and fries.  Mine was excellent and the fries were just perfect.  But of course my husband has to be special, he added guac and red onions to his.    Four Way Sampler:  Crispy chicken strips - GOOD, fire wings - TOO spicy for me, southwestern spring rolls - sorry Chili's still is the king , and fried mozzarella - they were OK.  Our service got us filled togo cups with our drinks.  +++"}
{"text":"A few of my coworkers and I have a monthly lunch meeting.  I picked this place so our Tempe and Phoenix ladies can meet and I have to jet after lunch for a meeting with my VP.  The staff is nice and friendly.    Parmesan Chicken Pasta - Breaded chicken breast served over al dente penne tossed in Parmesan cream sauce, then finished with marinara and Swiss. This dish was very rich.  The mix of the parmesan cream and marinara was a weird mix.  Not my favie."}
{"text":"November 22, 2015. 1:00pm. Went to Ruby Tuesday and sat down. Waiter was awful because ir took him a few to arrive to us and there wasn't hardly any people. I ordered the ribs to find out 10 in that they don't have any because the cook forgot to prepare them the previous night. Then waited for the waiter to cone back while he was doing nothing but looking around. I walked out. Things like this is why I avoid this business. Unprofessional and fucked up."}
{"text":"My husband and I made the drive from across town to redeem my free birthday meal. We arrived on a Monday, October 2nd at the end of their busy lunch time. I could choose either a gourmet cheeseburger meal or the salad bar.  Last year I chose the gourmet cheeseburger meal so this year I decided to try their salad bar.  It was a good choice as the salad bar has 55 items in which to choose from. I loaded up my plate! All of the many items on the salad bar are fresh and delicious. There was so much to choose from including pasta salad and more than one type of lettuce in which to build upon with the many toppings. I must add that it was worth the drive and we will return to this location. The hostess and our waitress were friendly and efficient. The restaurant was clean and inviting. They get a lot of business people in there especially during lunch. It is a nice place to go and enjoy a nice meal. Prices are reasonable and comparable to other dining establishments in the surrounding area."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for lunch today on my way to an interview in Chandler. I had the endless salad bar and my husband ordered the cheeseburger with fries. The endless salad bar was well stocked with plenty of toppings for the two varieties of lettuce and spinach offered on the bar. It was a fabulous. Everything was fresh and delicious.  My husband enjoyed his cheeseburger that was cooked medium to perfection. It was juicy and tasty. The fries were seasoned but too salty for our liking.  We had a nice waitress who was friendly and checked on us often. We enjoyed our lunch and left satisfied. In ending, the restaurant was clean as were the restrooms.  We will return to this restaurant as it is a nice location with great staff and service."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure today was the first time I've eaten at a Ruby Tuesday. My aunt & my 2 cousins & I stopped in for a late lunch after all flying in to the Phoenix Airport.  One of my cousins ordered the shrimp trio plate for $20 and it looked soo good. Especially the large, fried shrimp. Another cousin had the turkey burger with sweet potato fries. Fries were crunchy and delicious and I ate part of her burger, which was really good too. My aunt had the grilled tilapia which I didn't try, but the broccoli on the side of her plate was perfectly steamed and very tasty. I ordered the salad bar for myself. ($8 of you order independently or $3 with your meal). Tons of fresh crisp veggies, lots of great toppings, & a good choice of salad dressings. I loaded up my plate and left very full."}
{"text":"I fell in love with this place I've never been here before but I work up the St and didn't pack lunch so I can to see if I could get something here I have celiac disease so I asked for a gluten free menu they gave it to me and o got a turkey burger than manager made sure they cooked it on top of foil to avoid any sort of contamination he was very very very kind! Then he made sure to wear gloves when he put it in the bag to go! I couldn't be happier with the service I've been to so many restaurants and people don't make me feel as good and normal as this place! I'm so happy and will definitely will come back a lot!"}
{"text":"I only write about chains when something happens that distinguishes it from all the other chains. In this case, it was the lackluster service from the moment we walked in the door. The food was predictable, the salad bar was fresh and the ambience was like all other chains of this type. So bad service is noticeable.   We asked for a booth. There were very few diners in the restaurant and the dinner area to the left of the entrance - and far from the bar - was pretty empty. But the host chose to seat us right next to a large and loud group near the bar. Why? On a slow Monday night, the whole other quieter side of the restaurant had available empty booths but the only place he could find to put us was right next to a loud and boisterous party? WTF? I noticed that everyone who arrived after us were seated on the quieter side of the restaurant.   Next was our disappearing and interchangeable waitresses. We started out with waitress #1 who seemed pleasant and efficient but sometime after she dropped our entrees on the table, she stopped being our waitress and never checked back with us. Later it was waitress #2 who showed up to drop the check on the table. No one checked back with us about our meal or asked if we wanted dessert or coffee.   We had also asked for water when we were first seated and were given one glass. A single glass of water for the two of us. I guess we were supposed to share? Maybe it was just a slow Monday. Maybe the host didn't like taking a booth request. Maybe the service is always this sad. I won't be coming back to find out."}
{"text":"A 3....         Well it was Monday and I was at Tuesdays Ruby's that is....... I was in the area where its a restaurant meca  just about every  chain you can name  its close by. I had never been to a Ruby's so decided to stop by. Maybe 5 people in the place I asked a few employees and they said \" they had just had a big rush\"Anyway.....            I had heard of Ruby's claim to fame their Burgers so Burgers it was . Management was very informative when I had questions about the menu . It seems that \" they try\" and make as much as they can instead of bringing it in already pre-cooked  .            But, it seems that nearly every appetizer was already pre cooked  . I was told that the chicken came in Fresh that's good!  But, on the other hand I was told the mashed potatoes ( I had instead of fries) where not instant ,sure would like to see how they where cooked...            When I walked in the salad bar looked like a storm had hit it empty ingredients and pretty much a mess considering there was only a few people dining that would have been the perfect time to well.. you know make it presentable .             Now for the Burgers got two of their Prime ones \" This is my opinion\" of a good Burger good beef with enough fat to make it juicy not dried out which this was.It needs to have a Char be it coked on a Flat top or grill ( Brown food taste good!!) It looked as if they had been pressed which totally made that juicy Burger just a meat patty. Bun was very good and fresh toppings .             Those could have been very good Burgers... restaurant was clean except for the salad bar   Would I go back more than likely next time I will make sure the Burger has a little more of that Lovely ness called \"Fat\""}
{"text":"I went during lunch hour.  1130am on a Tuesday.  Service was slow.  Too bad there is no option for zero stars.  I thought the server had forgotten about us.    Food:  1.5 stars.  I ordered their Freshly Made Soup & Garden Bar .  I got the broccoli & cheese soup and a trip to the salad bar.  Super excited that I was able to create my own personal salad... I was disappointed by their selections.   Tomatoes where sliced not diced.  Broccoli was dried.  No garbanzo beans, They had no olive oil and balsamic vinegar for a dressing.  The salad bar was limited and nothing looked that fresh.  I believe it was an unlimited salad bar.  I only made one trip.    Broccoli & cheese soup was EXTREMELY salty and the broccoli was very limited.   If you are looking for a place to go to lunch and youre on a time crunch.  Avoid this place or take a late lunch around 130pm.    Hopefully, you'll get better service."}
{"text":"I've never been there, but I do see homeless people at night sleeping under the outdoor tables on the patio."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience I've ever had!   Service was horrible! Server came to our table with food in his mouth, wasn't attentive.   Portions extremely small and way over priced.   Will NEVER return."}
{"text":"Decent food typical of an applebees style resturant. A little pricy...SLOW lunch service. Only had 30 min for lunch and took that just to get our lunch."}
{"text":"The ambience is very cozy and the service was excellent! The food was very good & very delicious and was served at the right temperature. This server #661 Dale was excellent! The only complaint I have is it is  difficult to get in and out of the restaurant or restroom based on the fact that I'm in a wheelchair"}
{"text":"Place was clean. The food and service was fine. If you're in the mood for some Ruby Tuesday, you found it."}
{"text":"They had a 13.49 special which included a hickory bourbon chicken, an all you can eat salad bar, one side, and a dessert to share.  Most excellent!!(5/5).  The service was outstanding (5/5)!!  I have to admit though that the presentation of the chicken and side was negatively cast due to the very big plate relative to the actually food.   They say you eat with your eyes first and my eyes said WTF, but both chicken and onion rings were good (5/5).  The dessert was really good , a warm apple bundt cake with Carmel (5/5).  It's a chain but we enjoyed ourselves!!"}
{"text":"Fresh salad bar, so the turnover is good. I have the Ruby Minis as these make for good comfort food.  It is a comfortable place to relax. My Wife had Chicken potstickers, though I usually am not impressed by regular restaurant/diners with other genre foods, these were good, with crisp vegetables that and solid chicken cuts."}
{"text":"Workers need some work. Food at Ruby Tuesdays is actually not too bad if you go on a good day. Much better than Applebees. Rubys makes a decent \"real\" steak. But, the service is a killer for me. They need training."}
{"text":"Service was good, food was not. Parmesan Shrimp Pasta tasted like a can of unknown fake white cheese sauce was dumped on the pasta. There was so much of this sauce that the penne pasta wasn't visible. The shrimp was good because it sat on top of the globs of sauce. What happened to fresh ingredients??"}
{"text":"Ask for Lois. She let us bring in a birthday cake for my mom.  Lois treated us like we were her family (party of 8). My 92 year old grandma didn't like her Margarita and Lois swapped it out immediately for a strawberry Margarita. It felt like we were her only customers and we are a lively, loud group. Good food, good value, perfect for large, rowdy parties. :)"}
{"text":"Ate with group here on a Saturday night while in town for a soccer tournament.  This is pretty on-par with other Ruby Tuesday's.  I love the salad bar and sides, which is why I go.  The food is consistenly pretty good (for a chain), and they have healthy options between the salad bar and vegetable sides (steamed brocolli, summer vegetables, etc....).   I just love that Ruby Tuesday puts spinach on their salad bar so that you have a healthy choice besides that worthless iceburg lettuce!  :)   They seated all 8 of us pretty quickly, service was good, and the food was consistent. Positives: Pretty good salad bar (they have spinach!), healthy side choices, consistently good food. Negatives: They were building a new hotel next door so access was a bit tricky."}
{"text":"8/22/2017  Ruby Tuesday was very good.  We were seated immediately, our drink order was taken at the same time we were seated and we were asked if we needed anything in a timely matter throughout the meal  I ordered the 12oz Ribeye steak with baked potato and my guest had the Southern Fried Chicken Strips with mashed potato.  My Ribeye was cooked as ordered, it was just what I wanted and it really hit the spot.  My steak came with 2 sides, I ordered the baked potato and grilled zucchini and some Au Jus.  It was delicious.  My guest said they enjoyed their meal and really liked the flavor of the chicken and mashed potatoes.  She had the strawberry lemonade to drink and said it was delicious.  We declined to add the salad bar which could be had by trading one side order and  $1.99 or $3.99 outright.  The place was clean, had a good atmosphere, and the music was played at a decent level.  I would eat at Ruby Tuesday again and would recommend giving this place a try for a pleasant dining experience."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a fan of chain restaurants but I have to admit the Ruby Tuesdays always had good drink specials and a great salad bar. The queso dip is always a hit for me and the fact that you can always find a coupon makes it worth the price."}
{"text":"I used to live in Alexandria Virginia. I moved to Las Vegas in 2005. It's been over ten years since I dined at a Ruby Tuesday. The all you can eat salad bar has always been a drawing attraction for me. Today, I don't know something was missing. I had a grilled chicken sandwich, the wife had an avocado burger. She said the burger was skimpy on avocado . The salad bar was good, but being in Las Vegas, the buffets at the casinos at times can be better. I am hoping to return and have a better experience. But this time, the was something missing. It was bland and boring. There really was nothing there to say \"Hey come back again!\""}
{"text":"Update, Wonderful service and great staff! The food is amazing and we were very impressed with the new salad bar made salads . I'm a burger fanatic and my steak house bbq burger was awesome! A must try!"}
{"text":"Eh, this place needs to work on the quality of the food especially preparation. There were 4 people in our party and 2 of the meals were not completely cooked. My steak was \"supposed\" to be very well done which the waitress specifically stated would be cooked/brown all the way through. So, I start eating the steak and most of it had reddish/pink inside as soon as I cut it open. The waitress offered to make another and I told her to just comp it. The 2nd meal that was not completely cooked was lobster tails and anyone knows that if this meal is not cooked properly YOU WILL GET ILL. The waitress did get another lobster tail for us and it was properly cooked. Otherwise this establishment was ok. *So I called and emailed the \"Guest Services\" And all I got was lip service so \"Guest Services\" is a misnomer.lol...Don't waste your time with this establishment."}
{"text":"Awesome salad bar but mediocre service.  Had to ask twice for iced tea refills.  Perhaps the waiter didn't expect much of a tip since we got the salad bar....  he should have stepped up, I'm from CA & I tip well deserved servers."}
{"text":"Free gourmet burger on your birthday!  Came by during a quick 15min break from work to pick up lunch. Ordered a prime bacon burger from the very nice and very pretty bartender. She asked me what I needed and made sure I got exactly what I wanted and made sure the kitchen finished my order as quickly as possible due to my short break. It's so sweet and considerate of her.   They also have an awesome Happy Hour. $5 appetizers including crab cakes. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly very good. I'm all for Ruby Tuesday now. BF and I went cos we had a 'buy 1 get 1 free' coupon, and boy was it worth it. We shared the Boston Blue Burger and the Avocado Turkey Burger, and both were very, very good. They seriously don't skimp on ingredients either, and the wheat bun just made everything better. It's amazing how you can stuff two people for under 10 bucks. They have unlimited tasty fries too, but man...you have to be able to eat a lot to need refills. The full salad bar for just $2.99 was very tempting as well, but I knew I couldn't put all that in me. Although maybe the better idea would've been to get the salad bar and doggie bag some burger.... We tried the Ruby T, which is supposed to be pomegranate juice with iced tea, but it tasted more like plain iced tea than anything else.  The $5 cocktails were very enticing as well, but we decided to pass on drinking. Oh, but the service was quite possibly some of the best I've ever had. This girl was amazing. I think her name was Brenda."}
{"text":"Food 3 Service 4+ Bathroom 3 The waiter was a gem.  He was very charming and accommodating The restroom was clean and relatively updated however there were no sanitary disposal units in each bathroom that's pretty gross The restaurant itself is pretty dark on the wood needed dusting  The table class are also pretty country being plastic outdoor table clothes The green beans were good the steak was tender The salad bar looked updated clean and good The front door is not one that could be opened by an older or handicap person it took two women to open one door"}

{"text":"HORRIBLE customer service!!  I ordered desert to go and the brownie was literally hard as a brick. When I called to inform them how unacceptable this as, the response I got was \"well it was sitting here for a while\".  The restaurant is 1mile away from my hotel. I walked there the food was waiting less than 5 minutes. UNACCEPTABLE! I wish I had more thumbs so I could give this place 4 thumbs down"}
{"text":"Steak was good and I ordered their onion rings and steamed broccoli, perfect pair for sirloin steak."}
{"text":"Great salad bar as usual I ordered the chicken tortilla soup and there was not one shred of chicken in it I would recommend staying away from the chicken tortilla soup."}
{"text":"My friend and I dined at Ruby's last night for his birthday. Kaitlyn was our server. She did a great job! I got the sirloin steak, cooked medium rare with a side of onion rings and included salad bar. My friend got the salad bar. I wasn't fond of the tiny bread rolls because they tasted like raw dough. Brian B. mentioned lots of freebies and coupons. I'll have to check into that."}
{"text":"We took advantage of the two for $24.99. It comes with Endless garden/salad bar. We picked the classic cheese burger, which came out with fries too (that I couldn't even eat, lol). Than a dessert to share. Excellent customer service too!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding salad bar.  Fast service.  One of my favorite spots for fresh salads, day or night.  They do a great job of keeping the space clean and the salad bar refreshed.   Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Great salad bar. Not a lot on it, but everything on it was fresh and good. Our waitress was very attentive. Would definitely come back if in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times since my last review, but I think I'm done with this place. It is outrageously expensive for average quality food. $16.93 for a small plate of salad, a cup of broccoli soup, and a Coke. I could have had more salad, but the new 55 item garden bar was unremarkable. The bacon container was empty, the potato salad was dry and tasteless, the crispy onions had no flavor, etc. The broccoli soup had no broccoli so they replaced it with another that I think just had uncooked broccoli thrown in. I was seated right next to the kitchen door in spite of every other table in the section being open and was treated to employee conversations as they huddled at the door. $16.93. Sheeesh."}
{"text":"I love this Ruby Tuesday. Staff is always courteous and food is good. Try the lobster mac & cheese...it is awesome! The salmon is good here as well as the pasta w/shrimp."}
{"text":"Worst food ever, soup was room temperature, steak tasted just nasty, and had some type of liquid seasoning poured on it. Items on salad bar were old & dry. I've been here before and the food was pretty good, don't know what happened this time."}
{"text":"Wanted to give a shout out to Tyrene who's usually there working the bar. Friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Well it's Ruby Tuesday and it is just ok. My husband and I go sometimes for lunch because of the salad bar. We don't really care for the menu items. Salads are entirely to large and the cook isn't very good so the salad bar is what we always choose. But good luck on getting more than 1 drink. They never offer refills."}
{"text":"Came in at 2pm on a Sunday and we were told it was a 30 minute wait. Apparently they didn't see the empty tables or booths. Or it's the fact that the waitress said she couldn't take anymore tables. The manager and hostess really didn't seem interested in helping."}
{"text":"Second time I've gone there only to find out they are \"out\" of many things on the menu. This time it was \"sorry we are out of the ribeye, New York strip, Apple crisp and by the way the Brussels sprouts and green beans are getting a lot of complaints.\" They messed up many items on my bill. What I ordered wasn't even good and needless to say I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I only eat or order from a RT once a year or not at all.  After work, couldn't decide on a cheap healthy dinner for the night and remembered Ruby Tuesday had a buffet bar for salad.  Drove up, they weren't busy and easy to park.  I checked an app for coupons and saw a deal to save $5 off $15.  The website had a menu but no prices to decide on an additional item before going inside.  The salad bar had all my favorite and new favorite ingredients which I loved after the website said New Garden bar with over 55 ingredients.  I love fried onion crisp, dried cranberries, and candies nuts on my salad although they didn't have the candied nuts.  It was 8:30pm and some of the ingredients were picked over and they close at 10pm.  The potato salad could have been freshly tossed every once in a while but I understand it wasn't busy and don't want to waste food.  Nevertheless, I packed my salad.  I was given a small cup for dressing and a bigger cup for a side item from the buffet.  I got the potato salad and put the pesto pasta in the little cup for tasting.  I ordered two sides of mash potatoes to get up to $15.  My bill shrunk from $17 to $11.  The salad and potato salad were plenty.  I saved the mash potatoes for later.  I'm still wowed about how good my salad was and will return to this location or a RT period for more salad.    RT's salad bar has came a long ways because years ago I thought my salad was so flavorless and didn't see it as valuable for $10.  Helpful service and clean restaurant."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. Each dish was brought out separately so by the time the last person received their food the first people were already done eating. The wait on food was very long and the only hung said was they dropped the bun on the floor???? I will not be returning to this restaurant again. I give a zero rating"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner had to wait, but James was the best server veryhelpful, I would highly recommend coming here food was good..."}
{"text":"Typical Ruby Tuesday, however, the staff was excellent. They were a ton of fun and had us enjoying an otherwise routine meal. The salad-bar was fresh and well stocked but we'd go back in hopes of experiencing the same great customer service we witnessed on our last visit."}
{"text":"This will likely be the briefest review of any place I have ever ventured to.  Ruby Tuesdays is a place I happend upon quite by chance, while stumbling around an outdoor mall, packed with revellers and movie goers and teenagers - all wanting the same thing as me.  Ice Cream.  The restaurant loomed dark and large, in an otherwise deserted parking lot.  The dining area seemed lonely for a friday night.  The salad bar waxed impressive.  Non descript decor, low lighting, created this feeling of mystery.  But I digress.  We were here for the sole purpose of ice cream, chocolate shake, or bust.  Though I was unable to locate ice cream, or a chocolate shake on the menu - the ueberfriendly bartender was happy to oblige in any way.  I love that!  But we were to have more than we bargained for.  Once I saw handcrafted fruit teas (peach, mango, raspberry) on the drink menu, my curiosity was piqued.  Two tall glasses of peach ice tea (with peach chunks) later, I was spellbound.  I moved on to the chocolate shake.  My partner in potables delighted in freshly made lemonade (natural juice and bits of fruit such as strawberry, pomegranate), but there were also delectable looking cream sodas, rootbeer and coke floats, Margaritas and mojitos  They also flaunted their signature sangrias for $4 every day, all day - but it was time to head to our movie.  Though I am always on the search for eclectic and unique cocktails, this is definitely a place I would journey to for its delicious (and inexpensive) non-alcoholic drinks.  This was an unexpected treat in the potable galaxy."}
{"text":"2 words.. Salad Bar!  I like Ruby Tuesday if for no other reason than the salad bar. Its tasty and has a decent selection.  Came here with my pops on a random wednesday night outing and was pleasantly surprised. I hadn't been to RT in several years so i was delighted when I noticed they had seafood gumbo on their menu.  Now don't get me wrong here, It ain't the Oyster bar but its still some damn good gumbo. It had shrimp, chicken, and sausage (they said anduille but im not convinced) despite that I was still pleasantly surprised. If they worked on their gumbo to rice ratio (2:1 NOT 1:1) it would be spot on for a nice, inexpensive, bowl of tastiness. If i'm in that neck of the woods I will def return!"}
{"text":"I like Ruby Tuesdays for their Turkey Sliders and Salad bar. The New Orleans seafood dish is very good also. Don't waste your money on their steaks, they are horrible."}
{"text":"Good drink prices and walkable from hotel. We didnt eat.  can only rate on drinks. Service was just okay. We broke our no chain rule to avoid drinking and driving.  Ruby Tuesday closed early enough so we  were not hungover at work the next day!"}
{"text":"We've had a gift card for Ruby Tuesday's for the longest time and finally decided to take the drive and try this place out. When we first walked in, the restaurant seemed to be pretty busy. I immediately noticed the salad bar when we first walked in, this is something that is highly advertised for this restaurant but it did not look appealing. When we were taken to our table, another customer was complaining about the wait time for just their drink order. We waited about 10 minutes and were not greeted or met by anyone including our server for our drink order as well. We decided to eat at the bar instead. The bartender/serve was extremely nice. We were served rather quickly by sitting at the bar. I would highly recommend the burgers here and the shrimp fondue! I probably will not be returning to this location due to the disorganization of the staff (with the exception of the bartender)   and the rather uncleanliness of the salad bar"}
{"text":"Food was good Waitress was nice  Salad was fresh and the salad bar was clean!!   Even the croutons were crunchy, and they aren't always.   The manager came over to check on us. All and all, a good experience"}
{"text":"I found myself on this side of town the other night looking for a quick bite before dropping my son off at an event.  Having eaten here before I knew I wouldn't be blown away but I also knew the consistency of this place to be pretty good.  Ruby pulled through again.  I had a very low calorie grilled salmon with grilled zucchini and asparagus.  It was cooked to perfection and couldn't have been better.    The staff was top notch.  I had mentioned that we were in a hurry when I sat down and sure enough, they got us our food, drinks and tab in a very quick manner, much to my surprise."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten at a Rubys in a long time, but I was craving a salad bar. They have really revamped the look of the restaurant. They now serve cheddar bay biscuits as part of their \"bread\". Don't tell anyone...but no one can beat the cheddar biscuits at Red Lobster. Ok...now back to Ruby Tuesdays....the salad bar was fresh and very clean. Service was great and everything came at a timely fashion. Our drinks were never empty. And that's a plus for me!! If you happen to be on this side of town and feel like hitting a salad bar...come here"}
{"text":"We used to love this place, but over time, it has gone down hill.   Last year we went, and the food was not that great, over cooked to be exact. Then I received a gift card, and decided that I would go back and try again, after not being there for over a year.  I ordered the Seafood Trio with the Lobster, shrimp, and crab cake.  OMG, everything was burnt!  The picture on the menu showed a nice portion size of crab cake, but when I got it, it was split in half and the size of an egg.   It was burnt, along with the lobster tail and the 3 shrimp.  I was SO disappointed in that meal. My husband got the Tilapia fish and he said it was all dried out, and was very bland.  Our son's girlfriend ordered a steak in which she asked for medium, and it came to her, super well done. Our son's meal, which was a cheeseburger was good, as he said.  The ONLY good part was the so called Shrimp Fondue.  It wasn't even a fondue, but more of a dip.   I don't think we will be returning back any time soon."}
{"text":"Once upon a time I used to think Ruby Tuesdays was kinda OK for a quick lunch, the one at PV mall that is.  This Location in Gilbert is another story.   When you walk inside it's so generic, almost McDonald-ish,  you'd really expect to see a play area in the middle of the restaurant. I don't even think the booths were secured to the ground.  I could never enjoy eating in there when I compare it's decor to the original Ruby Tuesdays decor; dark wood ,stained glass etc.  The food went downhill along with the decor. They don't even have the Strawberry Tallcake anymore...WTF...?!"}
{"text":"Just a little bit too spendy for 5 stars.  The decor is great, food is great, salad bar is AMAZING.  The new dessert is deadly...beware.  It must be shared or you're in trouble.  Something with a brownie-like crust, then a layer of something similar to cheesecake, then some caramel, then peanut butter!  UGH.  But oh-so-yummy!"}
{"text":"Salad bar was worth the 5 star rating! Clean, great selections, loved it. I had a Asiago Steak and green beans cooked to perfection. Not always a chain restaurant lover but Ruby Tuesday's does a great job"}
{"text":"Got a great burger here tonight!  It was as good as I would have made at home. Perfectly cooked too. Our server Missy was fantastic as well."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick good meal. Took the kids, and they really enjoyed their options. Excellent service."}
{"text":"Went there specifically to eat their famous croutons at the salad bar. It was soooooo salty that my lips swelled up after-no need to buy lip plumpers. Other food was great & waitress was awesome. Not sure if I want to have salad bar again."}
{"text":"What a terrible, terrible experience. My party of 7 rolled in on a week night (8 pm). It was maybe 1/3 full at most. We were seated quickly and our drink orders were taken and delivered (5 waters, 2 sodas). Then about 15 min later the waitress appeared again to take our orders (burgers and a chicken option). It took over an HOUR to recieve our food!!! An hour for burgers when the restaurant is dead?! The manager did throw in 2 random free apps which was nice. Finally our food came out and it was pretty good overall! But our drinks were refilled only once in over an hour and a half. When we placed our orders, we were sure to tell the waitress there would be 4 seperate bills (3 couples, 1 extra) however when we were given our bills they were all mixed up and the waitress just stared at us as we tried to keep calm and not show our frustration. My friend also noticed she was overcharged for something and the waitress replied with \"at least you got free appetizers.\" Excuse me?! We ended up walking up to the register with the waitress to basically show her how to do her job and input the right orders for each bill which took another 20 min!!! So yes, the food was pretty good, but not worth the 2 hours of problem after problem! Unfortunately will probably not be back even though we were hoping to make it a regular!"}
{"text":"Well don't fall for that two for 25.00 , worst value for money ever, the petite sirloin is the worst steak I've ever had in my life & I'm 63, , that steak is about 1/8 inch thick, & very very petite! baked potato was burnt on inside, salad bar was good & Dessert was tasty, For that type of bar food, stick to chili's, low quality food has probably why there are almost no RT in the valley, service was good,  it I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend wanted to eat here since we've seen the commercials down in So Cal. Now I have eaten at a Ruby Tuesday before in Cleveland, OH, and I thought this one would be the same as its midwestern counterpart. Wow, this Ruby Tuesday was completely different. From the outside it looked like a Cocos or Sizzler. The Ruby Tuesday in Cleveland looked and felt like an upscale Chilis but with a better menu. They even had Stella Artois (my favorite beer) on tap!  The service here was okay at best, but the food was disappointing, especially after having an amazing experience at another RT. If you want to eat at a Ruby Tuesday, you might as well go to one in the midwest. Stay away from this one."}
{"text":"Woohoo!  Who knew there was a Ruby Tuesdays in Las Vegas?  Not this girl until when I saw it when we were driving down Craig looking for a place to eat.  (We live in Henderson and are not up on this side of town often.)  So, I am on a diet.  Annoying!  But they have some great options on their menu that state the calorie count.  I ordered the Creole Catch, which is labeled as having 335 calories.  Wow!  It was really tasty.  Husband had a bacon cheeseburger and the kidlings had pasta and fried shrimp, respectively.  The salad bar was pretty impressive.    They bring those little cheese knot biscuits to the table.  They looked yummy and disappeared from the table, but I didn't want to even think about the calorie count in that!  Our server was a sleep at the wheel.  He wasn't rude, but he wasn't friendly, was not prompt with refills or the check.    I ended up chatting with the manager and she was really nice.  Overall, I would return if I am out that direction."}
{"text":"Stopped at this Ruby Tuesdays on a road trip driving thru Ohio. It was clean, staff was friendly and the food came out hot & fast. I only gave it 4 stars simply because it is your typical franchise food. But at least you know what to expect. All in all, a good visit and I would eat here again if I were passing thru town."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, came for my step daughters birthday dinner, great experience especially coming for first time. Deffiently made a lasting impression on us. Will be coming back our server was fantastic as well. Deffiently will be coming back thank you all that work at here!"}
{"text":"A stinky smell greets you as you walk in through the double doors. It's been there forever.  Nice! Tip: please don't expect much from the waitstaff - they are not happy you are there taking their food and wasting their time. I only get the salad bar so as to not unreasonably bother the clearly pre-pissed off staff. I get it to go despite the warm and inviting atmosphere. Yep, it's special. And no, Management, I'm not going to email my review anywhere else. Feel free to cut and paste. Or better yet, work on your customer service."}
{"text":"Ah...not my favorite place for eats.  Honestly, main reason we went there for date night dinner was because I had a coupon for 25% off our meal!  Yes, cheap date.  The one and ONLY Ruby Tuesday in the entire Las Vegas is on Craig Rd., thankfully this is closer to my side of town.  Unthankfully, that means, yes, this Ruby Tuesday is VERY close to the piggie farm!  Ugh, if the smell of leftover slop doesn't make you hungry...I don't know what does, ha ha!  So just be aware that if you come to Ruby Tuesday here, that funky smell outside is probably not from the restaurant, but from the stench of the leftover buffet that awaits some happy pigs.  Pigs which will later, in a round of great irony, be part of a buffet.  Oh the Circle of Life...  I should have been wary once we entered Ruby Tuesday that even with this coupon floating, and on a Friday night, this place was pretty much empty.  There were open tables everywhere!  But only a small handful taken with smaller parties of 2-4 people.  It was quiet...you could almost hear the sound of an owl hooing, and the brush of a tumbleweed passing by.  However, I was determined to use my 25% off coupon!  I sucked it up, placed my eating gun in the holster, put on my @$$less chaps, and tipped my cowboy hat to prepare for the ensuing dinner shootout.  Our server was pleasant, and quick to the draw for drinks.  For some reason, she KNEW I had that darn coupon on me.  Either she's good, or she knows that her Ruby Tuesday was only busy when these coupons came out.  Bad, bad sign.  I should have high-tailed it out of there and rode out into the sunset.  My stubbornness persisted as I ventured into the menu.  Being a chain, Ruby Tuesday encompasses just about all the types of food you see on a typical chain menu.  Burgers, fries, steaks, chicken, sandwiches, wraps, sliders, salads, some seafood, desserts, and a kids menu.  They do have some special items for a brunch menu, as well as a 'Chef Inspired' menu to showcase what they do different.  A GOURMET Ruby Tuesday if you will.    If I had tons of money like some of you YELPERS who get to eat at a steakhouse on The Strip once a week, I would probably be doing that too.  I'm middle-class (BIG PIMPIN'...SPENDIN' CHEESE), so luckily my niche is around cheap eats or places that give you the best bang for your buck.  For many of us, that buck is getting smaller!  I will just wait until Yelp offers me some extra moolah and a side job as their goodwill ambassador to dine if finer establishments.  With most of Ruby Tuesday's entrees, you get a choice of two sides to go with your main.  I chose the 'Chef Inspired' Caribbean Chicken, rubbed with jerk seasoning and topped with mango salsa.  I chose a side of Creamy Mashed Cauliflower.  My date for the evening chose Louisiana Fried Shrimp, with cajun spice breading, and a spicy chile sauce for dipping.  She chose a side of onion rings.  For our other side dish, we both chose the Ruby Tuesday salad bar!  Yes, it was the other main reason why I drove down there for dinner.  I love a good salad bar that comes with a meal.  It's almost like having another entree if you build your salad right!  As I like it, more bang for the buck.  This salad bar wasn't half bad either.  All the produce was fresh and crisp.  I made myself two FATTY salads before our entrees arrived!  Surprisingly enough, their bleu cheese dressing was pretty killer.  Chunks of bleu cheese galore, I was game.  The salad bar, unfortunately, was the highlight of the night.  Our entrees?  Not so much.  They were really kinda bland.  Very BLEH.  I wasn't impressed by my 'Chef Inspired' Carribbean Chicken.  The portion wasn't the greatest, two tiny breasts!  I don't mind tiny breasts...but these ones just had no substance to them.  The jerk seasoning on them wasn't salty enough, there was more heat from pepper than anything.  They were cooked ok (kinda hard to mess up a chicken breast), but the mango salsa on the chicken didn't bring much to the party either.  I could have easily made this dish with a better salsa at home.  The Creamy Mashed Cauliflower was ok, but again it wasn't seasoned well enough so they were bland.    My lady's Louisiana Fried Shrimp failed to impress.  The breading was way too heavy, and they were overcooked.  Golden brown crispy was not so.  This bordered on dark caramel, a sign of too done!  Funny enough, these shrimp were OVER seasoned...too much salt and spice.  The spicy chile sauce for dipping didn't help since when you used it for the shrimp, everything was just overpowered by heat.  Killed the taste of the little overcooked shrimp inside.  Her side of onion rings were ok, nothing worth noting except these were better to dip with the spicy chile sauce.  Not too impressed Ruby Tuesday.  Of course you are a chain so I guess that puts you par for the course.  Even with the amount I spent for dinner after coupon, I could have gotten a better meal at a number of other places.  Lucky for you SALAD BAR = +1"}
{"text":"I expected the place to be busier for a lunch hour so that was a pleasant surprise. The food was tasty and the salad bar was well-equipped but the cost was higher than I like for a lunch spot. Good value? Eh. I didn't feel like I was robbed but would have opted for a fancier place for that cost. Our server didn't bring us the complimentary bread until our meal was done and only after we hunted her down for it. She made an excuse about having tried to get us some earlier but there being none available. Would have been believable if we hadn't seen another server take some to the table right behind us. I'll probably go back but won't be a regular here."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Ruby Tuesday's since the early 90's, back when a bunch of restaurants that all looked and sounded the same opened(TGIFridays, et al).  You know, the kind of restaurants that make the servers wear \"flair,\" has a bunch of obnoxious crap on the wall, and has gimmicky sounding food.  I wasn't really impressed then, which is probably why I haven't been back in 15+ years.  But, I have this friend who is a really picky eater and ends up eating at the same restaurant 80 times in a row, finally tires of it, then moves on to the next restaurant where he repeats the process.  His current fave is the newest addition to the corporate monstrosity that is the Tempe Marketplace.  Because he's the picky one, and he's usually driving, we let him pick the place.  I wasn't thrilled to go to Ruby Tuesday's.  I kept having Office Space flashbacks of that dorky kid at Chotchkie's doing the finger-as-a-gun shooting thing.  Ugh.  So when I walked into the tastefully decorated restaurant with a rather large and decent salad bar, I was surprised. Our group of 5 was seated at a nice dining table that was off to the side a little bit instead of being crammed into a booth or in the middle of the dining room.  Our waitress was nice and accommodating to our needs, especially when it came to paying the bill, which they do with great efficiency.  And, I'm a huge fan of salad bars. Especially when they have a selection of vegetables that is not limited to iceberg lettuce and dehydrated cucumbers.  I made myself a beautiful salad with mixed baby greens and a variety of colored vegetables. No offense to the staff, but my friend ordered a salad from the menu, and my concoction was wwwwwaaaaaaayyyyyy better looking.  I could easily have been satisfied with my vegetable artistry, but the lunch special entree included the salad bar.  So for $15 (tax and tip included) I had 2 turkey \"sliders\", french fries, a gorgeous salad and an iced tea.  Thankfully, one of our cohort helped me out with the meal, because there was no way I could finish all of it.  I admit I was wrong to be so judgemental. I'm sorry Ruby Tuesday, you deserve more credit than I gave you.  And to make it up to you, I promise to return and lay down more of my husband's hard earned cash."}
{"text":"pleasantly surprised - met Sis and her Daughter for lunch last Monday - Tempe Marketplace is midway between us - we had a very good seafood fondue appetizer with crispy fresh tortilla chips; then Sis had a bacon cheeseburger she raved about, and T and I had crab cakes and Salad Bar.  Crab cakes were nicely prepared and a generous serving, and the salad bar was totally fresh ingredients and good quality too - Spring mix lettuces, and everything I could think of to crowd onto the salad plate - it was all good. And our server Maria was always there with a smile to refill the yummy mango iced tea and bring more napkins. We'll meet there again - mos def worth another visit"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this particular RT. What a disappointment. We were led past empty tables to the back of the restaurant. Employees  were sweeping the carpet with a broom when we arrived and were still sweeping when we left. All I could think of was all that dust floating in the air and onto my food. I ordered the salad bar. It was the smallest offering I had ever seem at any restaurant, but particularly at RT that  promotes their salad bar. The pasta \"salad\" simply wasn't- cooked pasta, small diced ham and peas, no dressing. So disappointing. I will compliment our server who was very pleasant. But it takes more than staff to make a customer return."}
{"text":"The food is good here my service was good as well however the other patrons were not very pleasant also wish it wasn't so dark inside"}
{"text":"I experienced great service here and really good food I will definitely be back to this location"}
{"text":"Just awful!! I ordered a steak medium well and it looked like it was still breathing when it came to the table. It was WAY undercooked. The grits I ordered were so hard, I could barely get my fork in it.    The only reason I gave this place 2 stars is because the manager did everything to accommodate me. He took the steak and grits off my bill and let me order a new meal. I ordered the cheese burger sliders with fries the second time and they were decent. The salad bar was good."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. The salad bar was amazing!  My husband and I split the Big Dipper. We are hoping this isn't seasonal as replacing the wings with the cheese fries was a great idea.   I had the hickory glazed salmon which was out of this world and my husband got your typical bacon cheese burger.   Our server Chante was a delight and tended to our needs with a smile.   Too bad this is my favorite restaurant but it is so far away from me. I live deep in the heart of Henderson and it's completely on the other side of the world. Even though it's far, it's worth the drive once a month."}
{"text":"Just wanted to say I visited this Ruby Tuesday location to get my free Birthday burger. And the lady at the bar was very nice. I showed her the coupon on my Ipad. My phone was acting crazy. Anyway it was no problem at all. What really made me feel good is they gave me fries with my burger, she said they came with it.  Also when I got in my car I looked and they had given me some cute little bread biscuits... Not bad for a free treat, and the burger & fries were really good."}
{"text":"After waiting over 30 minutes for a table, I was extremely disappointed to be told they  \"ran out\" of the spaghetti squash marinara. The only thing ill eat there. FAIL!"}
{"text":"Slowest service imaginable.  food, ok.  felt bad for servers.  restaurant needs new management."}
{"text":"I generally like this place.  The food is always cooked right for me.  I withhold a start for the fact that the salad bar has taken away some of the items I like.  There was no longer any pasta salad on the salad bar and they replaced the ham with what is basically diced luncheon meat.  It's not a large salad bar so a couple of changes make a big difference.  Still it's only $3 to add it to your meal so it's worth the money to add it.  I like the burgers, the steaks are OK, the seafood items are pretty good.  The coastal trio which consists of a lobster tail, shrimp on a skewer, and tilapia that can be prepared two ways - were all excellent.  The ribs were not bad, but not as good as you'd get at a real BBQ place.  The mac 'n cheese is excellent.  The children's menu is a little strange in that it's all a la carte.  I prefer a kids menu to include a drink and small desert as one package.  Prices are not bad, but I usually recommend waiting for a coupon to go there.  They send you a free burger coupon on your birthday.  Service is friendly.  The kitchen is a little slow when it's busy so allow enough time to eat."}
{"text":"I dine at this Ruby Tuesday once a year.  It has become tradition to meet a co-worker at this Ruby Tuesday every mid-February.  Ruby Tuesday is busy, but not to the point that you have to wait for a table.  Service really depends on how busy the restaurant is.    I've had their Double Decker Burger, the Grilled Salmon, the Tilapia, and the Coastal Trio (lobster, tilapia, & shrimp).  Most of the entrees cost about $15 and to be honest, it's pretty good.  The serving sizes are decent and if I want my dishes a little healthier, they'll put the sauces on the side. Overall, Ruby Tuesday is okay.  It's a chain with competitive prices and a variety of options on their menu."}
{"text":"I sent a complaint to corporate about the overcharge on my bill. The manager called me and addressed this issues. They would refund the overcharge to my card. I would recommend this restaurant but just be careful to watch your statement. Ruby Tuesday does have excellent drinks choice at the lesser price."}
{"text":"I come here occasionally for dinner. Salad bar is decent, staff is good and friendly, entrees are unremarkable but good enough. I always sit at the bar and enjoy the TV while eating.  Overall, a typical Ruby Tuesday - there are no surprises here."}
{"text":"We went to Ruby Tuesdays Tuesday night and we were so impressed with the food and service!  The selection is awesome and atmosphere great!  We would love to have one up in Northern Nevada!!"}
{"text":"Beth was so sweet and nice.   This was my first time ever at a RT and had a great time.  Can't believe I've never ever eaten at one.    I signed up in the club and got a free app.   The shrimp app was so good...  I will be back"}
{"text":"I came in a stood at the host stand for a couple minutes and no one greeted me. The only employee I even saw was the bartender.   Due to the fact that the parking lot was bare and restaurants aren't typically very busy around 2:40 on a Wednesday afternoon, I'm assuming that the staff wasn't simply overwhelmed by business and too preoccupied to seat me... So I left and took my business to the Ruby Tuesday in Ballantyne (10 minutes away)."}
{"text":"Can't really say anything good or bad about the place.  I was able to find a fairly healthy alternative which is a good thing.  The service was good and they were friendly.  Was here with coworkers and never would have chosen this place if it were up to me.  I would rather have something local when I am out of town.  North Carolina should have some great bbq or anything but the place was chosen for it's location."}
{"text":"I use to love the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and Hot wings at Ruby's but they have really gone down hill.  The new burgers are pretty good and the bottomless fries have a bottom because I have trouble getting the wait staff to come back to my table in a timely manner.   I use to go about 3-5 times per month and now it is 1-2 times per year.  There are many reasons and most of them revolve around sorry staff and pathetic cooks."}
{"text":"The salad bar here is always a go to.  Their revamped menu is pretty good as well. Love that you have veggies as side options w/ out having to shell out extra $ for them. The burgers here are great too.   Everytime Ive been here, Ive had an attentive, polite waitress (which is always nice).  They have a great patio for when the weather permits, sometimes w/ live music. I really have nothing bad to say about this location."}
{"text":"My husband, son and I went to Ruby Tuesday this evening for dinner and firstly the food is grossly over priced.  My son ordered the ribs and chicken fingers and the chicken fingers were over cooked and the ribs were disgusting.  They were almost all fat.  GROSS!!!! My husband ordered the Strip Steak and it was mostly gristle.  My food was ok but for the money it was sadly lacking.  We will not go there again.    P.S.   for the money Texas Road House is a thousand times better!!!!!"}
{"text":"Variety on the menu, salad bar. Good onion rings. Good burger sligly over cooked as medium. Service great"}
{"text":"Probably the worst Ruby Tuesday I've been in. Weren't busy and I sat at the bar. Two people who came in well after me were waited on first. Friendly enough service but she was more interested in cleaning and preparing for closing. She was working hard but because of interest in cleaning up missed some things from my order.   Bowl of soup was more like a cup. It was hot, and I like that, but it tasted burned so it was probably bottom of the pot and been on high all day.   Should no better than to order steak. Ordered medium and it was well done. Very well done. Would have sent it back but again staff was busy cleaning. Wasn't sure what I would get if I did.   When ordering asked for extra butter for baked potato. Wasn't there.   Salad bar was scarce in some items.   My fault for coming in after nine. Should have gone to local sports bar."}
{"text":"Horrible! My steak was overcooked and rubbery. I had requested medium rare, it was more like well-done. I seriously could not saw through it with the giant steak knife I was given. I had also asked the server for Heinz 57 and she puts ketchup on the table (REALLY???). When I complained about my steak, the manager offered to knock a couple bucks off (Again, Really?!!?!)"}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Ruby Tuesday for years, but I am glad that I did.  I LOVE their Mango Tea ! :)"}
{"text":"Good dinner and very friendly waitress. We all had steak and salad bar. Everything was cooked great and salad bar was constantly getting topped off which is a plus. Waitress was very polite and much appreciated on Mothers Day."}
{"text":"We went to Ruby Tuesdays today for a late lunch/early dinner. There was 5 of us including 2 children. The food was much better than I had expected. The service was excellent and the wait staff fully explained the menu.  The place was clean and so were the restrooms which is important when you have kids. Over all it was great for our short time in Charlotte."}
{"text":"We were a group of 12 who came on a Sunday night for dinner.    Our orders were taken pretty quickly and our food came out rapidly.   Everything was hot and our server was attentive.      I just had a burger and fries with the salad bar.   Their salad bar is always good and fresh and several of my friends had it as their meal.   My burger was fine except that I ordered it medium well and it came really pink inside.   I didn't want to make a fuss in front of all my friends so just ate it, but I am not crazy about raw ground meat.   One thing several people were upset about was that they got the special where you pick an appetizer, entree and dessert for a set price.   One of the sides was asparagus, but our server failed to tell everyone there would be a $2 upcharge.    To even make it worse, the asparagus was extremely overcooked and really did look horrible.  Nobody ate theirs and it is such as waste of food.   Servers should be trained to let the cooks know when something isn't working."}
{"text":"Typical Ruby Tuesday food.  Though you can't mess up a salad bar and premade food, but I was wrong.  The service was the worst and SLOW."}
{"text":"They have a very nice selection of very tasty food at reasonable prices. The salad bar is also very nice with a good selection of fresh veggies. Check out the unique croutons. They are delicious. The service is very good with attentive and personable servers. Great place for a date or time out with the family."}
{"text":"Walked In quickly seated but forgotten we waited and waited until I got sick of it and left came to El Nopal mexican grill across from them, excellent food and service! Was the first and last time at ruby Tuesday don't waste your time and money here!"}
{"text":"Bad food.  I don't think it is a problem with this location.  More of a Ruby Tuesday problem.  Food sounds good on the menu, but the appearance and taste is poor and has been past 2 times"}
{"text":"My client choose Ruby Tuesday for lunch which I've never experienced prior. The restaurant is large and we were seated asap.   The lunch menu had such a large variety and I was overwhelmed with what to order- Salads, 14 different types of beef, turkey and chicken burgers, seafood, pastas, chicken, steaks and even ribs. Finally decided on the Chicken & Mushroom Alfredo - Grilled chicken tossed with linguine pasta, sauteed baby portabella mushrooms, green peas, and rich Parmesan cream sauce. This entree was generous in size, tasty and flavorful. My client ordered a grilled chicken salad and it was large and looked tasty.   Our waiter Eric was super. He constantly checked in and took good care of our needs. For checking out Ruby Tuesday for the first time I was impressed with the variety on the menu, quality of my food and the service.  I would return to Ruby Tuesday in the future and check out some of their other entrees."}
{"text":"Thought I'd give this place a second chance after extremely slow service last year.  Clearly nothing has changed.  20 minutes for a chicken breast that was so salty I didn't want to eat.  As well, the server was pushy and clearly not interested in being friendly.  She also only had one other table while we were eating and never found it important to check to see that the food was okay, or if we needed anything."}

{"text":"This review is for the Arrowood location.  Good  Biscuits are delicious  Seated quickly with large party Salad bar was well stocked Waitress made new tea once requested  Bad  Score was a 90...didn't see this until our way out. Gross!! 1st batch of tea was terrible. We paid 7.50 for 3...ridiculous Our waitress had too many tables so I do not feel we were adequately taken care of The manager did not pay the same attention or service to our table as he did ours...this bothered me more than anything. I felt somewhat discriminated against.  Not a great experience. Definitely will not be back to this location!!!"}
{"text":"Tried Ruby Tuesday for the first time ever, and I've got to say that while it wasn't the worst experience, we were not necessarily impressed.  Ordered: Pesto pasta: extremely oily and greasy, tasteless for the most part and just gave a stomachache later Bacon Cheeseburger: the meat was not seasoned at all, so it was fairly tasteless note: the fries that came with the burger were really good, so half made up for the burger Shrimp Fondue: sadly the best thing we ate that night, the dip was solid, although a very small portion Sangria: was honestly a poorly made drink. was not sweet at all, and the alcohol content was overpowering so we left most of it Overall, let's just say while the food was subpar and not worth the money, the service is great and we were treated well by the server and manager. Maybe we just need to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"By no means am I a regular at Ruby Tuesday's but I have been here enough times in the past several years to know a few important things.    One, I love their salad bar.  It is always fresh and has some great topping and greens options.  I have to get the salad bar every time I come in.    Two, I was disppointed after not having been in a while to see that their menu had changed drastically.  They used to be known for their burgers.  Today, some of the burgers are still there but not like they used to be.  For instance, I was impressed that they had a bison burger in the past.  Now, it is no where to be found.  Three, given the change to their menu, I have found other items to be quite satisfying.  I think I have tried something different each time I have gone in during my last few visits.  Most recently I tried the new spicy chicken tacos.  They were indeed spicy.  Not too overwhelming though.  It was enough spice to make its presence known in a big way.  Spicy grilled chicken, sauteed onion and bell pepper, cheese, cabbage and salsa in a soft flour tortilla was very good.  There were two on a plate.    Those two tacos plus my self-assembled salad were satisfying enough on their own.  For some reason, though, I was unable to pass up dessert tonight.  The cheese cake was calling me.  So I answered the call.  I'm glad I did.  It was a thick cheese cake.  At least three inches tall and topped with raspberry sauce and crushed fresh berries.  It was delicious and it filled me to the top.  I went home with a full belly and a happy heart."}
{"text":"The salad bar was great! Everything was fresh and tasty . Drinks were great! I had the ruby refresher (for an extra $1 I upgraded to a large) My chicken tortilla soup was decent . My friends food was decent as well. Seemed on par with Applebee's .  The reason for 3 stars? Service was terrible! Restaurant was maybe 1/4 full? There was plenty of waitstaff available . As a matter of fact most of them stayed as close to the bar as they could so they could continue visiting with each other . I had to wait over 5 minutes to ask for a spoon for my soup, wait another 5-10 for a glass of water , I think what set him Off was that my friend sent her dinner back . He looked at her and asked \"what do you want me to do?\" She said \"take it back , and I will order a side of fries and be done with this\" he was totally put out by this , stated he would grab a manager (he never did) and eventually surfaced with the fries.  1st and last visit to ruby Tuesdays"}
{"text":"Ruby Tuesday has definitely went down hill! I went for lunch with my family for my mother's birthday. We were sat right away however the first table that the hostess sat us at was EXTREMELY DIRTY so we asked to sit at a different table. That should have been a sign that we should leave. It took awhile for the server to come to our table. While we were waiting for our food to arrive we over heard the family sitting next to us complaining about the quality of food. The family was very unhappy to say the least. Our food took a VERY long time to come. After the food arrived we quickly realized our food was not right. The burgers were so greasy that it turned the bread to mush. Moreover, the fries and burger was cold. My bro ordered pasta and it was cold and quite frankly gross looking. The server took my moms burger back to the kitchen for them to make another one but it only took 3-4 minutes. There is no way that you can make an entire burger and fries in 3-4 minutes. I'm sure they just replaced the soggy bread with fresh buns. When the manager came to the table we told her we didn't want the food and she was apologetic. We wasted 45 minutes for food that we didn't eat. Thanks Ruby Tuesdays for ruining my mom's birthday lunch."}
{"text":"This restaurant was located around the corner from my hotel, and seemed like a simple choice.  The food was good and the service outstanding.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch after a movie. This is the second time I've been here, and the food and service have been excellent both times. This time I had the Smokehouse Burger. The burger was great, the bacon was crisp and the onion rings were yummy. Loved the fries as well.  The bread they brought out before the meal was amazing!"}
{"text":"Ate here on 10/06/15 with the wife and two kids. kids eat free on Tuesdays which is why we came. the food is mediocre but the staff was nice. my cheeseburger came out without cheese but the waiter fixed it after I mentioned it. who forgets to put cheese on a cheeseburger...?   overall I would say maybe worth it with the kids eat free deal but not without it.   however the pre dinner rolls are excellent! we should have stopped there"}
{"text":"Staff very friendly and service was fast for a Wednesday. Food was very tasty  the only thing that bugged me and didn't like was the plastic mugs/cups, they where old and kinda yellow. Other then that it was good."}
{"text":"Stopped in here with a party of 10 after spending all day racing around Carowinds. They had a table setup in about 10 min, which is pretty decent with it being a Friday night. Our server was very attentive and actually seemed to care about his job. We seemed to sit there for about 45 min waiting for our food but the staff came by several times and appologized for the wait. The manager offered up some complimentary goodies. Once the food arrived all was forgiven, at least by me. I ordered the Ribeye. I have to say, I have paid as much as $60 for a ribeye before and this one was pretty close to same taste. Obviously it wasn't a 20oz cut or anything huge but it was good and cooked properly, Medium! My wife on the other hand did not have such great luck with her steak. She ordered some Asiago Sirloin or something like that, medium well, and received an unevenly cooked hunk of cheese covered steer. Needless to say she was not happy. Management handled the situation again and all was good. I would eat here again and give them a chance to show me how they operate with a smaller party."}
{"text":"Best service and the best salad bar in my opinion. I like a place w/a good salad bar. And I like a place that takes care of their salad bar.if u want a fresh and good salad bar this is ur place.  The drinks r nice and tall as well and only $1.00 extra go for it."}
{"text":"I ordered a burger medium rare.  The beef quality was good and made to order as requested.  They also allowed me to substitute grilled zucchini instead of fries, and it was very good."}
{"text":"This review is a reminder to myself (and to the world) that the service at Ruby Tuesday is NOT GOOD. And the food is mediocre. I'd say just avoid it for the service.  Few days ago, Tiffany H and I were hanging out for almost the whole day, and we had planned to have dinner somewhere else in Concord. Our plans failed for unexpected reason. It was getting late and we were starving. We compromised, and settled on Ruby Tuesday, and it wasn't a life-changing experience.  It was my first time to eat at any Ruby Tuesday and I assure you it'll be the last time. I understand that this is a national casual dining restaurant chain, what I don't understand why the waitress had to be unfriendly and rude. That's one reason why I can't stand chain restaurants.   One and Half Yelps"}
{"text":"I was extremely disappointed. The only lift was my waitress who was kind. The food was nothing like the hype. Broccoli was hollow & limp. Baked potato had black spots, the shrimp were so greasy. Yuk....wont go back."}
{"text":"I picked up Ruby to go for my daughter.  I ordered the grilled chicken salad.  It was good. The salad portion was extremely fresh.  The server recommended the raspberry poppyseed dressing. It, too, was good.   I have eaten here before and was satisfied.  Today they exceeded expectations."}
{"text":"I ordered mini burgers with salad bar. My burgers were very dry..1 tsp of sauce on bottom bun makes no sense. Salad bar was great. Happy hour menu is lacking varity. If I ever go again it will be for salad bar."}
{"text":"It's moderately priced food that is good but not great. The free cheddar biscuits are a nice touch. Subbing the salad bar for a side item for $1.99 is a great deal."}
{"text":"The food was horrible! the salad bar is not fresh at all! My chicken was sad and dry. It was my first time trying this place.  It smelled funny and my booth seat was torn. The server was really nice other than that it was a waste of money.  They advertise freshly made lemonade and when i asked our server if they had it she said it was just regular lemonade from the fountain drink, I pointed at the \"freshly made\" on the menu and she said, yes but its just minute made from our drinks. No wonder it was lonely in there!!"}
{"text":"We went to the RT at the Gilbert location on the 25th of June.  It was Horrible. Well, not horrible but not good enough to ever go back. We were excited to see all the new items on the salad bar... 55 i think it said...  well more than half the items were empty or with few crumbs.  The restaurant, at that time, was not crowded enough for an excuse of being too busy.  An employee walked by us as we were getting to the end of the salad bar and I mentioned to her that there were many empty items, she looked at it quickly and said, I'll get to it when i can. welp... not the answer i expected to hear. Once we sat down, eating the salads, my son all of a sudden, spit the food out of his mouth.  There was a huge bug in his salad, nestled within a piece of lettuce. I know it happens but it was disgusting. We called the waitress over and she said, OH MY GOD, THAT'S DISGUSTING!!!!  she told the manager and he was too busy to come out telling her to tell us that he would take care of it, but that he was cooking in the kitchen and would hopefully come out to talk to us before we left.  I had ordered the fried shrimp.  I assumed that it was hard to ruin shrimp. well, it was weirdly spicy as well as really mealy... yuck.  I asked for tarter sauce and the waitress told me they ran out of it. The manager came out and looked at the bug which by the way is still on the table, and said, sorry, i will take off the salad bar part of his meal.  And then asked if everything else was ok. I handed him my shrimp and said i couldn't eat it, especially without tarter sauce.(to kill the spice). He told me they stopped carrying tartar sauce, all they had for the shrimp was the cocktail sauce.  That is ridiculous.  How much could it really cost for a bottle of tartar sauce??? The ladies at the next table were complaining so much about their service and quality of food, I just couldn't deal with my lack of quality. Once getting the bill, he removed my shrimp but never removed the salad bar for the bug incident... I didn't want to even wait to deal with it, so we just paid and went on our way.  We will not go back there... maybe to Tempe, if we are desperate..."}
{"text":"I spoke with manager just after posting and have tried to edit now twice. Service fine, other than the flatbread came out over done - never should happen but management should empower wait staff to refuse poorly cooked food or it maybe the lack of staff communicating with management when they doubt product quality or they just don't care on both fronts. Manager stood and chatted with hostess then disappeared- not checking on any of the hand few of guests. Not my worst experience nor my best! I did choose to eat the bread as served because I do like mine on the done side.  Just if not served the way you like or want ask for management."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of their better locations. We come here for the salad bar whenever we want something a little healthier close to home. A quick tip, Ruby Tuesdays has a lot of options if you are trying to eat healthier. That was a pleasant surprise. Our waiter was fantastic. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. I was expecting a BLAH chain feeling, but the salad bar was fine, service was good, and the bacon cheeseburger with \"endless\" fries definitely kicked my normal lunch of ramen noodles in the ass. I won't go here every day, but it was a good alternative to falling asleep in your company's lunch room. They also apparently have $5-all-day mixed drinks, but I did not partake for some reason."}
{"text":"Went here after a spring training game in Suprise and it was just okay.  I ordered the buffalo chicken tenders with fries.  The tenders were drenched in buffalo sauce and the fries were at least crunchy but neither was anything special.  My husband got a steak with mashed potatoes.  He actually really enjoyed his meal.  I loved those mashed potatoes.  We both got the salad bar as well which wasn't bad except the ranch dressing was really thin.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place or go back...nothing special at all."}
{"text":"Good for seniors who like bland predictability. And a very average salad bar with ten items. I know dinner salad bar is better because sometimes the elders in my family want to go here and, being the compliant person I am, we go. This was not a good visit, food was almost inedible but bartender was nice and beer was cold so I am blocking out the food experience because we all know what it is. Chain food quality. Have fun, granny."}
{"text":"Not one bad visit to this location and we've been coming here since we moved here, roughly 5 yrs.   On our most recent visit we ordered: $4.58- 2 Iced Teas  $13.99- *Tuesday Special; Steak & Lobster with broccoli & baked potato $17.99-*Tuesday Special; Steak & Lobster Mac 'n' Cheese with broccoli & mashed potato $5.98-*Price is add-on to meal, 2 Salad Bar Buffet  We were seated and greeted right away. Our server took our order and checked on us, often. Service was good, nothing spectacular.  We then headed over to the Salad Bar. Very clean! We just recently went some where and I had major complaints about their salsa bar which was 'EW!' so it was quite refreshing to visit a place that kept up with their serve yourself thingie majig! I liked their selection of greens, iceberg, romaine, spinach and mixed greens. Dressings were OK, nothing I haven't tried before.  My steak was med-rare, hubster's was rare. It was seasoned well but one tid bit, it's a cheap cut so it tastes better cooked rare. Although my steak was still a little pink, it was really chewy, not fun for my jaw. Hubs enjoyed lobster, although a little over cooked it was still a deal! My Lobster Mac 'n' Cheese had flavor but I guess they stick the MnC under the salamander bc the lobster that was exposed was dry and chewy but the lobster within the MnC was still moist. Only thing I was disappointed in was their broccoli, it's probably the simplest item in this meal and it was way over cooked, borderline mushy.  The usual good experience, it'd been awhile since we'd been here but nothing has changed, still the same ole good experience :)"}
{"text":"I know it's a chain but it has been a long time since I have been to a Ruby Tuesday's. My husband and I went to this one last weekend because I was starving, wanting salad, and we wanted to watch the NCAA games.   The drinks were nice, nothing outrageous here, I did get the white and red wine sangria and they were both very tasty, as long as your looking for something sweet. The salad bar, which is the main reason we came, was really good. It is not huge, but it has nice choices and even has a pasta salad that is pretty decent. My husband got a burger and I got a chicken sandwich and I would say they were both decent at best. The chicken was a little over cooked and the burger was too. The fries were tasty.   So this place doesn't have a huge reason to come here unless your looking for a ton of salad lol. There wasn't anything terrible about it though either. I will probably be back because I don't know of a place that has a good salad bar but I might stick to an app and the salad bar instead of a sandwich."}
{"text":"Oh damn...oh DAMN!  The ONLY reason we came here was because I had a gift card for getting third place in a Harold Ramos look-a-like contest.  We sat at the bar and I cannot believe how busy this place is.  People in the US still are totally content eating and drinking mass produced, crap.   I know a lot of Yelpers who wil eat anything and also, there are Yelpers who think they are Thomas Keller.  This falls in the \"I settle for anything\" column.  There are better options.  The staff here was all high school kids and the managers all looked miserable.  The food was cafateria food...but greasier and more expensive.  The bartender kept telling everyone how she has bronchitis, yet continues to work and serve people food..lovely.  The only redeeming this is they have beer...glorious, glorious beer..."}
{"text":"Food is okay.  It is what you'd expect from this type of restaurant.  The service is bad, not really bad, but bad.  The wait to get even an extra napkin or a refill on a drink is very long.  Appetizers (dumplings, not finger food) brought without plates.  Had to get some from the salad bar which were chilled because we never seemed to be able to find our waitress.  Food was not served as ordered.    The worst part is the place is really, really filthy.  There was something (god knows what) splattered all over the wall next to me.  I could give them a pass and assume it just happened except for the bathrooms.  They are vile and have been every time we've been here.  I'm not talking about the surface of the bathroom.  I mean the hinges on the doors have about 1/4\" of dust on them.  The floor of the bathroom against the wall is filthy.  This place has obviously never had a deep cleaning.  One of my family members managed a different restaurant and once said that a good rule of thumb is that the kitchen is usually as clean as the bathroom.  If that is the case here then the kitchen is repulsive.  The Streetsboro Ruby Tuesday is much cleaner and the service is significantly better."}
{"text":"Hands down, great service! While at dinner tonight,  my husband began to choke on his food. He thinks he put too much pepper on his food, which made him almost have an allergic reaction. The staff was super accommodating and helpful. They took the food off our bill even though they did nothing wrong. Hands down, we will return! My husband was sort of upset he couldn't finish his meal as he said it as delicious..."}
{"text":"Great service! I just came from a 15 hour trip and decided to go out of the hotel. I made the right choice. Erick, the waiter that helped me was such a friendly guy and made the dining experience much nicer."}
{"text":"Just overall nasty food. Got the Petite and Fried Shrimp with Rice Pilaf and the Mac and Cheese and just nothing tasted right. Service was great though, they were polite and prompt, and the dining area and restroom were clean."}
{"text":"We had a very nice waitress and a pleasant booth for lunch at Ruby Tuesday's.  It was a beautiful sunny day so we walked to Tempe Marketplace and decided to stop for some wine and salad at RT. The lunch crowd was there in force and the place was busy but our waitress gave us attentive service and we enjoyed the lunch. The food on the garden bar was fresh and continually re-stocked throughout the lunchtime. Free Wifi makes it a good place to stop and check your email (you never know when you have missed an offer for millions of dollars from a bank in Nigeria!)."}
{"text":"Met a client there around 7:00 pm. I wasn't expecting much from RT, but they sure didn't make much effort to please.   We were told that getting drinks would take a bit longer because there was only bartender, which was totally acceptable, but apparently our server meant to say \"Our bar doesn't actually have anything.\" Our server came back from the bar a half dozen times claiming that they were out of whatever our party of three had ordered. Lagunitas? \"Don't have it.\" Yuengling? \"Don't have it.\" Bottled domestics? \"Don't have any.\" I asked what the Sam Adams Seasonal draft was, and she said \"It's Sam Adams.\" When I asked her to clarify WHICH Sam Adams, she just said, \"It's Sam Adams,\" apparently not understanding what \"Seasonal\" means. Oh, and they didn't have that either.   The salad bar had some good offerings, and seemed clean and well stocked. The vegetarian in our group ordered a simple grilled cheese, and was informed that \"Our kitchen can't make that.\" While I understand that ordering off the menu isn't always an option, we're talking about two slices of cheese between toasted bread. The fries that came with our dinners were so heavily salted that we had to brush them off by hand.  The server was nice enough, but she obviously did not know anything about the menu or bar offerings. With their extremely limited food and drink selection, it's hard to justify ever coming back."}
{"text":"The smell of the place took me off at the beginning of the experience. I was shocked-perhaps it was the carpet? No one was there but they still sat us in a far off corner which felt weird as well. We ordered their new pretzel burger which tasted good but was super greasy. I could not eat the whole thing because of the grease, no wonder it tasted good. My daughter got a chicken strip meal and was satisified. For dessert we had the red velvet cupcake but we could have gotten better choices at a grocery store. Don't think I will go out of my way to eat here again. When we left we went to Culver's next door for ice cream and that seemed to make the meal better!"}
{"text":"My wife and I see these commercials all the time and we dont even have any in Cali that we know of. So we had to try it today. There is alot of great sounding dishes on the menu. I didnt know what to get and im a sucker for memphis dry rub ribs. They where ok. I usually like to try places signature dishes but i couldnt pass it up. They have alot of different flavor lemonades and ice tees also. We tried a few."}
{"text":"As usual we got excellent service from Loise, the bestest server I have ever had anywhere! We ordered the Ribeye Steak, Chicken Bella, Smokey Mtn Chicken with the salad bar and Firewings and Thaiphoon Shrimp. The Ribeye was ordered medium rare but arrived medium, which was OK because it was very flavorful. The fresh zucchini is a recommend as a side! Very good! The Chicken Bella was an excellent blend of artichoke, mushrooms and cheese. The Smokey Mtn Chicken was good too."}
{"text":"Nothing special, but an OK burger (nothing like they claim to the best you will ever eat)  I would have probably gone higher on the rating, but they did one of the biggest no no's and pet peeves of mine - they left the MAYO on when I asked for it off.  Again, seems silly but I pay attention to the places that pay attention to me (the one who is giving THEM money and going back to them)  Again, all and all it wasn't bad and my wife loves the salad bar so we will probably be back, and I hope when we do they do a better job of listening."}
{"text":"I am really glad to see that this chain has made it out West, as we have many of them in South Florida. The staff, quality of food and cleanliness at this location was absolutely amazing. The salad bar was very clean and fresh. Our server, Lindsay was very friendly and outgoing, and attentive. We went with a local who lives in North Las Vegas and she was equally impressed with our server, the cleanliness of the restaurant, and the quality of food. Highly recommend, and this server needs a raise!"}
{"text":"The BEST burger I've have is their TRIPLE PRIME CHEDDAR BURGER, which is made from three of the BEST cuts of beef.  It's juicy and comes made to order (I recommend medium rare, so you don't diminish the flavor).  It's the best $12 burger in town!"}
{"text":"Food  was great , service was beyond great as well the environment was relaxing place was clean I suggest this for anyone"}
{"text":"The service was great! The hamburgers are just okay. Go to Fudruckers if you want a real good burger. Their drinks are excellent. My favorite was the strawberry lemonade."}
{"text":"The service here is what amazes me. We were greeted by a guy with a great big smile who seemed thrilled that we had walked into his restaurant.  He took us to an outside table. Within minutes our server arrived and helped us choose a menu item that would serve us.  We split a baked ravioli dish and added a trip to the salad bar for $2.99.  The ravioli was delicious and plenty for the two of us. Our server, Eddie, returned frequently to keep our water glasses full and to make sure that we were okay. Eddie made us feel very welcome. If we lived in Phoenix we would return again to this Ruby Tuesday. As it is we are just here for the night before flying out in the morning."}
{"text":"Everyone at Ruby Tuesday is amazingly friendly and helpful! Their service and commitment to customer satisfaction is spectacular!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Ruby Tuesday in a long time. Found this one and decided to give it a shot. When we were walking up to the front entrance, I thought the restaurant was closed, couldn't see any lights or people through the tinted windows.  Our server was polite. We asked for a few minutes to look over the menu. When we were ready, it seemed as though she was gone for ten minutes. We waited and waited.   My wife ordered the crab cake combo with salad bar and her order came with two small crab cakes which was nothing to write home about.   I ordered the Hickory Bourbon glazed Pork Chop which came with string beans and a scoup of mash potatoes. I also added salad bar for $3.50. My pork chop was over cooked and slightly moist towards the center. The glaze was sauce poured over the chop.   As for the salad bar, there were only three types of greens; ice berg, spinach and leafy greens. The 9-12 different dressings didn't have any signage so you had to guess what type of dressing you were selecting.  I don't think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Excellent service. There were 13 of us there tonight for an older adult birthday party. We asked for separate checks and the waitress was very accommodating, friendly, and efficient. Sorry that I didn't get her name because I would have liked to give her a shoutout here!"}
{"text":"My daughter took me here for mother's day and we were both disappointed as it was our first time here.  When we walked in there were a few people waiting so we checked in with hostess, she asked how many and said it will be 15 minutes. ... and I said do you need our name?  She said no,  I have it under control.  About 15 minutes later,  she comes out to the lobby and ASKS US IF WE'RE NEXT!  How the hell do we know? That's your job!  (we didn't actually say that,  but thinking it) Ok, so once we were seated, we literally waited 10 min before someone took our drink order.   I ordered the Asiago peppercorn sirloin which looked delicious on the photo. When it came out,  you could see the cheese slices on the meat. They weren't even melted. The whole experience was very disappointing. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"The best thing here is the strawberry iced tea!"}
{"text":"This is one of our weekly restaurants.  The atmosphere is casual, the service is consistently good, and the food, well it is always excellent!  The GM is always available, and has stopped by our table every time we are there.  I usually get a different meal each time we visit, and I have yet to be disappointed.  I enjoy the seafood meals, and the Thai Shrimp, .....it is off the chart!  Prices are reasonable, and since we are on the e-mail list, we get some special coupons, which can really help.  Pictures will follow as we are here at least once every two weeks.  NCFoodGuy"}
{"text":"Tryed this place out on mothers day for lunch, place was 90% full. We got a table right away,  and our drink order was taken.  Great service .   I order the burbon salmon and it was excellent.  All the food came out fast. I was very impressed with the staff.  After our meal the manger stopped by to make sure we were taken care of and  wish our table a happy mothers day.  I seen him stopping at all the tables as people finished eating and asking how everything was.  All the food was great and service was great. I will be back,Had a very enjoyable lunch."}
{"text":"My mother in law and father in law decided to go here for a casual dinner midweek. My husband and I joined them with my 2 year old daughter (main reason they picked here...wanted something child friendly). We were seated at a round table with a brown tacky looking tablecloth covering it. The windowsill behind us was pretty dirty (and even included a dead fly as a dining companion!). The floor was also super sticky. Decor in general seemed outdated and sloppy.  They don't have any vegetarian options, except for a \"Veggie Trio\" where you pick 3 sides along with the salad bar. The sides aren't anything spectacular...so I had a hard time coming up with 3. I went with broccoli, a baked potato and French fries. So much starch, but like I said...pickings were slim. Not sure why they got rid of the black bean sliders. My baked potato (as well as my mother in law's) were both dry. I got a small scoop of broccoli that was probably microwaved. The fries were standard. The salad bar was pretty good, besides the warm plates and the salad bar attendant cleaning while we were in line. We had to stop and step back several times to let her do her thing. Not a big deal, but not sure why it could've waited a few mins (it wasn't busy).   Overall pretty disappointing. My mother in law was pretty grossed out by the sticky floors and subpar food. Definitely won't be eating here again :/"}
{"text":"Service isn't always the best and this restaurant has temperature issues. I ordered shrimp skewers with the baked mac and loaded cheese grits. The mac and cheese was not bad I did like it. The shrimp was grilled, yet cold. Okay, not a super big deal I guess, but the grits they served me were some inedible hard round shaped bowl of nonsense. I need the chef to Google grits to get an understanding of what grits should look like. No, this isn't the south and I don't expect much, but I should at least be able to eat my food. Look at the picture you can't even stir these grits, but you could ball them up and play catch with them if you lost your baseball... SMH"}
{"text":"F&#%$* FANTASTIC!!  Another FREEBIE for joining the E-Club. FREE Handcrafted Gourmet Burger!!  I decided to try the Boston Bleu-Burger cooked medium with bleu cheese & steak sauce made with Sam Sdams Boston Lager!!  yeah...sounds good don't it!!  BEST damn burger I've ever had!!! I almost lost a finger!!  Prices are reasonable $8.99 burger, looks like a real cool place to eat and a small bar too. Only thing is just 2 locations both in NE/NW Las Vegas.  If you haven't checked this place out DON'T WAIT!!"}
{"text":"We've only been a few times but have always enjoyed the food and service. Wish it was closer to my house!"}
{"text":"This place is always empty, and I do not see why?  The Triple Prime burgers are fantastic, and well prices. The french fries are also great. This is one of my fav places to eat burgers, and I am not a supporter of chains. I ate here on a whim one day, and was very impressed.  If you are a burger fan (and by that I mean someone who like a burger that tastes great without a ton of toppings, you enjoy the beef) order the Triple Prime burger, you will love it.  As one reviewer also noted, they have a large selection of really good lemonades and teas, and they are not the usual chain variety.   Overall I really enjoy the quiet, good service."}
{"text":"Food was ok for the most part it is kinda hard to mess up a salad bar. It wasn't very clean inside several tables were dirty with dishes on them. Floor was really dirty as well."}
{"text":"Had a reservation since friday for 20ppl and they are not ready have no seats available. When I came to the desk the lady seemed confused looking at the computer and once I spoke of taking my company else where she said she could come up with something but didn't give a time of how long it would take... The waiter was better making sure we all got our food and drinks but at the end he could not remember who's bill was who's and what food goes on what bill. We stayed a hour before giving up n just paying whatever the ticket said"}
{"text":"It just keeps getting worse at this location. On a recent visit with my coworkers our server got 3 out of 7 orders wrong and one she forgot completely and had to get the manager to rush the order. The problem is you can't rush salmon and he ended up getting his meal when everyone else finished eating. Other things that were wrong was the slooooowwww service and my other two coworkers who didn't get shrimp or the correct veggie. But that took forever to fix. And portions are tiny. You no longer get your money's worth here.  The server was so bad that the rest of the staff was sucking up to us. Constant apologies from the manager.   Every time I've been back here, it's been worse than the previous visit. If the place wasn't down the street from my work, I would avoid this place completely. Honestly, Ruby, I don't know what's happened to you. You used to be such a good chain. Now even Jack in the Box down the street is better than you.  Save your dollars and go elsewhere. There are several better places about a mile down the road."}
{"text":"Where do I start...... do not waste your money. I felt like I spent money on over priced t.v. Dinners.Please remove this place off of Craig for false advertisement. Menu makes you think your going to eat some food that a chef created but really they are giving you TV dinners smh."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! I had the double stacked chicken and I highly recommend it.  Brittany was out server, she was very energetic and promptly took our order,  kept our waters full, and made sure we had anything we needed."}
{"text":"Great experience.  Food tastes great.  Loved the salad bar.  Comfortable seating.  Good service.  I ate too much at the salad bar, so I wasn't hungry to eat my meal, so my husband got to take it to work as leftovers.    Close to home.  Thanks for the birthday gift certificate, $9 off."}
{"text":"With all of the talk about these great burgers on TV, I had to get in here to check it out for myself. This is a new location, located in the worst intersection in Gastonia.  The atmosphere is cozy here, with dim lighting & plush seating. The place isn't entirely too big, which produces some longer waits. The bar area isn't much to behold either, with little in the way of a nice bar atmosphere.  I had the special triple prime burger, or whatever the name is, & wasn't too impressed. I guess I fell for the large advertising campaign on tv, whoops. It just tasted like your normal frozen burger at any chain restaurant, above average, but nothing spectacular.  I probably wouldn't head back here for dinner, considering I wasn't really impressed. Just seemed like your normal large chain restaurant, with average food."}
{"text":"I love this place :)  The service is awesome!  We have our favorite, John, but everyone is awesome.  Bevin is a great manager, with the best staff. We love the salad bar, the ice cold beer, and my husband LOVES the wild berry tea. We have made this our # 1 place to eat and relax. Great job Ruby Tuesday :)"}
{"text":"my wife gave the most succinct review of this place, better than anything I could have written - \"The food was better than I expected\". she had a grilled chicken blt and I had a basic burger and both were way better than I would have expected from a chain restaurant with a centrally placed salad bar.  the service was fast and everything looked clean.  some mook in a dress shirt accosted us about how the meal was going after we were done eating and asked why we didn't get dessert.  fuck off shift manager assface, I'm not here to drive your UPT or attach rate or whatever. I hate when the manager at any restaurant interrupts my meal, but especially when you try to upsell me.   Betsy (our server) kicked ass though, free drinks to go is a solid play."}
{"text":"Oh, how I miss the Ruby Tuesday that used to be practically around the corner.  Right before it closed last year, my husband bought a gift card for us to use.  It was a good deal, so we figured we'd have no trouble using it up.  Ha!  A couple of weeks later, it was gone.   Our trip to this venue - now the only one in Las Vegas - was much longer than I anticipated.  But it was worth it.  The service was terrific, and the food very good.  My husband had the Pasta with Broccoli and Chicken.  Not wanting the creamy Alfredo sauce it came with, it was no problem to substitute marinara.  He also had the salad bar (an additional 2.99), so there was enough of the main dish to take home leftovers.  We love leftovers!!  I ordered the surf and turf combo, which was a couple of shrimp in a spicy barbecue sauce, a tiny grilled chicken breast with a fresh mango salsa, and a very small steak.  I substituted broccoli for the brown rice, again with no problem.  I didn't get the salad bar, but I'm not a big eater, so I had leftovers to go, too.  It was all very good, though I would have liked it better if the shrimp were a bit bigger.  All in all, it was a good meal, and we'll be back.  When the price of gas goes down."}
{"text":"Ruby's is really close by, so we come here fairly often. Especially when there are coupons floating around, which there usually are. We generally like having dinner here, and tonight was especially good.   I ordered my usual glass of wine and my favorite RT dinner - the crabcake.  I order broccoli and mashed as my two sides.  I like that the broccoli doesn't have anything added, and isn't too raw or too well done:  as Baby Bear says, it's just right.  That helps atone for the crabcake, which is probably drenched in butter.  It's really good.  My husband had the sliders and salad bar.  It's on the lunch menu, but is available at dinner, too, for a few bucks more.  Two beef sliders (with fries or any side of your choice) and all-you-can-eat salad bar for, I think 9.99.    I like Ruby Tuesday's burgers, too, but their most recent menu incarnation now has two different qualities of meat available.  In the very old days, Ruby's burgers were awful.  I used to order them sometimes because I knew I'd never have to pay for the meal, since I'd invariably send them back and complain.  Then, a few years ago, they went more upscale and the burgers were top shelf and fabulous.  I don't think I've had a burger at Ruby's since they switched to the A and B burgers, just sliders, but since I discovered their crab cake, that's what I usually order.  I love the fact that their drinks are reasonably priced - $5 for cocktails with their house brand liquors, which are decent quality.  The drink, though, depends on which bartender at which RT happens to be mixing that night.  I've been at Ruby Tuesdays all across the country, and it sure can vary.  Our server, Raymie, was very friendly and efficient, though I was surprised she never heard of Yelp!   But the best part of our dinner was that -  ta-dah - none of the servers were running the infernal carpet sweepers back and forth!  This process was going on at every single Ruby Tuesday's I've ever been in, be it Las Vegas, New Jersey, Indiana, Tennessee, everywhere. And it didn't matter if it was 7 pm or near closing.  It was so annoying and pervasive that I emailed corporate (with no response), and then called.  Their curt answer:  \"That's the way they do things.\"  Maybe others have finally complained, or maybe the rain made all the servers sluggish and lazy tonight, but finally we had a meal without that damned \"Whirrrrrrr.\"   May it continue in 2011."}
{"text":"Looking for some where to eat yesterday was hard to actually getting in all across Charlotte and in Matthews it was between 1and 2 hours to wait. I ended up settling with Ruby Tuesday  haven't had it in a while so I was ok with it.  I ordered my favorite one of a few old items left on the menu and I ate my loaded potato I was pleased started in on the broccoli and chicken and guess what my chicken was pink yuck yeah uncooked chicken is gross that's why I stopped going to Ruby Tuesday because my chicken or steak was always under cooked. The manager said she would fix it and by fixing it I got a free dessert.  Yeah me...never again"}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant the food is good, the waitress was nice and the atmosphere was fine. Walking distance from the hotel was key in eating here.  There was nothing wrong and nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate 3.5 instead of only three. Went here tonight with my mom and boyfriend. First time too and based off the reviews I had my standards pretty low. We ordered Flatbread for our appetizer, it was okay. It had its moments but I've had better. I ordered top sirloin with mashed potatoes, while the other two ordered ribs. I tried some of my boyfriends baked macaroni and I didn't care for it. Then again I don't like baked foods half the time so I'm biased. The steak.. I ordered medium well and it was a bit burnt on the top for my liking, tough to cut as well. All forgivable if they didn't cook it with so much salt.   Mashed potatoes were good but very buttery. The food is what made me deduct the rating, that and the insane price at the end. For three people and no alcohol it was $78 bucks, not including tip. Another reason why I deducted half a star (I said 3.5) is because I pointed at the Absolut Strawberry Lemonade and I got non alcoholic. Lady, I know I look young but I wanted a drink. Happy hour prices are decent though. I'd probably go back for the alcohol prices during Happy Hour and maybe get a different appetizer."}
{"text":"Ruby Tuesday is great!   I seriously give them an \"A\".  The restaurant has an overall clean and appealing look...we are always made to feel welcome and the service is always wonderful. The salad bar is always crisp and fresh. Today I had the Petite Sirloin and Lobster Tail. The steak was cooked perfectly at just the right temperature. The Lobster was fresh and :melt in your mouth\" delicious. the baked potato was huge! This makes several visits now to this restaurant and they deserve my solid \"A\" grade! I travel to northern Nevada (Reno area) often and I only wish they'd open one there."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to love this place. I'd never been, but it reminded me of a nicer Friday's or a Chili's or something. I liked their more creative menu and their drink menu.  All good things. But, the actual experience was meh.  We went around noon on a Sunday. The place was empty, awaiting the post-church crowd. We're a sans-church crowd, so we were there first.  As far as first impressions go, unfortunately, this place did not make the best. Our booth was dirty, with the seat and the back end of the table covered in crumbs and pepper, like they only cleaned as far as they could reach.  Our waitress, while sweet as pie, looked like she'd just done the walk of shame. Her black shirt, front and sleeves, was *covered* in crusty, dried food, like she'd spent the day feeding toddlers. It was only NOON, and the place was empty, so this told me it was yesterday's shirt or one she pulled out of a pile on the floor. Her hair was just thrown up in a quick pony, the kind you do to wash your face or sneak out of someone's apartment the morning after.  The whole package wasn't very appetizing. It didn't say a fresh \"Good morning! Let me serve you edibles!\"  She also forgot the biscuits that came with our brunch until we'd almost finished and I had to ask her for them. (Biscuits were tasty, though. Size of a half dollar and only two of them, but tasty. I assume we could have gotten more if we'd wanted them.)  Our meals started with a \"parfait\" of plain yogurt, blackberry puree  and granola. What it seemed like was plain yogurt, jam and a crushed up Nature Valley granola bar. But it wasn't bad. In fact, it was surprisingly good, but a bit too filling.  That's essentially a whole meal in itself.  We each got an omelet (their brunch menu is fairly limited) and the arrived hot and with \"homestyle potatoes\" which were basically cubed Ore-Ida out of the bag. They tasted ok, but were a little dry and served with a side of ketchup.   But what wasn't dry was the butter/oil drenched omelet. It was so covered in grease the edge of the omelet were crispy and butter was pooling on top of the eggs.  Did it taste good?  Yes, it wasn't bad, but way, way, way too oily for me. WAY.    We casually mentioned it to the manager who picked up our plates and asked how we liked everything.  She said they had a new \"spec\" that required them to brush the omelets with butter before sending them out to the table.  I could see where people would like that -- it's just not for me. I prefer a healthier omelet.  We left with mixed feelings. The food wasn't bad -- but we wished it'd not been as greasy and had a few more options on the brunch menu.  It was also a little on the pricey side for what you get, considering Vegas is full of amazing restaurants and buffets.  We were fairly turned off by the details, like our booth being dirty and our waitress so unkempt. That sort of killed it out of the gate, to the point that we almost just paid for the OJ and left.  Dirty doesn't inspire confidence.  If she'd been tidier and the booth cleaner, I'd say 3 stars with more pending other meals, but I don't think I'll be back now, unfortunately."}
{"text":"TL;DR: Used to be in California, like an upscale Denny's.  There used to be a few Ruby Tuesday's in California, but unfortunately there is no more left here. This particular Ruby Tuesday happened to be by our hotel so we decided to stop by to see how good it really was. Inside it is very nice and spacious, we were quickly seated and our waiter was quick to bring us our drinks.  After looking over the menu I was intrigued by their salad bar, so ordered that and an order of chicken tenders. The salad bar has about 55 items in it that range from spicy broccoli to hummus and pita pieces and the regular salad toppings and dressings. It was nice being able to put on your plate whatever you wanted to try, and for $3.99 it was not a bad deal. The spicy broccoli was okay, a little spicy but not anything you wouldn't be able to handle. The potato salad and pasta salads were decent as was the hummus and pita. Way better than a side salad!  The chicken tenders were pretty good themselves. They do not taste like they were frozen and you are given plenty of them to dip in the honey mustard sauce. Together the chicken tenders and salad bar was about $15 plus your drink. It is a little pricey but the atmosphere is pretty laid back and it was nice to have a good meal after a day on the road.   Check it out, you might like it!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for dinner.Our service is really good, but the food left a lot to be desired. This is the second time I've eaten there and my wife is in there three times as well, due to her friends picking this place. For the both of us the food has been awful every single time. There are much better options out there for food."}
{"text":"We used to love this restaurant but it has gone downhill. My soup was cold and flavorless. Had to ask for it since waitress did not bring it. The salad bar's lettuce was limp and old. My husband ordered the New Orleans Seafood. It also lacked flavor. The waitress also never came back to check on us for refills. She apologized and said they had a rush. Since when is 1 more table a rush. Disappointing and off our option list for good."}
{"text":"I'm giving one star because zero is not an option. The server was mean. We asked for an allergy menu and he declined to bring me one saying go online. Their interactive menu requires you set a location but this location does not have their menu loaded. After asking for the manager I was finally given a menu, which is a tiny print book where they consider \"margarine\" acceptable for a dairy allergy. When I was finally able to order they modified a cheese burger and charged me for customizing, charged me for a gluten free bun, and then charged me extra for the avocado even with removing the cheese. They wouldn't allow me to use the garden bar. Worst experience ever! Do not eat here if you have food allergies. They are completely unhelpful and actually annoyed with questions. He maintained his attitude with everyone at the table."}
{"text":"Some of the new stuff looked good in the pictures but it all seems like the same. I fall for it every time. Wife and kid didn't finish their food dry Mac and cheese with chicken needed more chicken. It's not iron chef should have hit golden coral.   Only thing that satisfied me was the salad bar and they really really need pepperoncinis in their bar.   Rarely saw waitress until the end."}
{"text":"Cha-ching cha-chain place. I was the guest, and my hosts picked the place. I was in from out of town, and none of us are familiar with the Streetsboro area, so we agreed to something common: Ruby Tuesday. Common is the word, without much else to it. I'm not against going back, and I get why plenty of people like these places - they're consistant for what they are - chain stores doing chain-like business."}
{"text":"Ate there last night Sunday after thanksgiving. Fantastic burgers and salad bar. Way better than Red Robin. Service was great. Price right.no wait. HIGHLY recommended."}
{"text":"Just killing some time before a pickup at the airport.  Beautiful interior... the staff was super helpful and attentive.  Had a fantastic mixed drink and some fries.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Average diner.  Nothing special.  My chicken And coconut shrimp were over cooked and dry. Service was attentive and everything was correct."}
{"text":"I wish I rememberd the waitresses name, she was really nice. The salad bar  was fresh and t the soup was flavorful."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly. Food was ok. Environment was was clean and open. Burger is $9-$12, other dishes start out around $12 and go up from there. I would give it a 2.5 star rating.  Was there on Tuesday summer night around 8:30pm and the place was fairly empty. No inclination to come back. I've been to other Ruby Tuesdays and for some reason found them better."}
{"text":"Food is good, prices are good, promos are pretty cool,...and our server Monica was AMAZING! Give her a raise Ruby Tuesday! She was very helpful, personable and kept up with our sense of humor."}
{"text":"Solid lunch spot with a great salad bar. I am still trying to figure out their pricing structure. How can soup and salad be only $2 less than a steak, side and salad? They might do that on purpose because I always end up spending just a bit more to get a dish with the salad bar as a side. However you could get the salad bar as a main and never go hungry again. There is a huge amount of choice from bacon bits to edamame. The food has always been fresh and promptly served.   Last time I went here I was my usual 10 minutes early. The person who was meeting me was about 10 minutes late. Other early birds can relate to sitting alone in a booth staring at your phone trying to look cool and collected. The waiter in this situation was absolutely great! He brought waters, and after confirming I would wait to order he still brought out some biscuits for me to snack on. It is little experiences that can lift a chain experience to an outstanding lunch.   I can be a little tricky to find with the construction. Don't be discouraged if you think you are driving onto a job site. It is probably fine until the men in orange vests start yelling."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying there were some very good things, and some not-so-good things.  We received a coupon in the mail that came with an announcement of some new items on their menu.  My husband and I frequent RT's, but we haven't been in a while, due to our schedules.  We decided to go there tonight and see what was new.  First off, our waiter, Thomas, was delightful.  He was friendly and attentive.  He deserves 5 stars.  We both went for the salad bar to start off with.  I love their salad bar, but when I went to get a plate, the first 2 I picked up were still dirty.  I reached all the way to the back to get one that was clean.  I did enjoy the salad, all the ingredients were fresh and delicious.  And, their little biscuits are wonderful.  I only wish they were a bit bigger.  For our dinners, my husband got the Cajun Seafood Plate with mashed cauliflower (way too garlicky) and grilled zucchini.  He enjoyed the meal, but should've paid more attention when Thomas mentioned the garlic in the cauliflower.  I had one of their new items, the meatloaf with white cheddar mashed potatoes and grilled zucchini (I asked for it to be extra grilled, and it was...yummy!).  When imagining meatloaf, I get a picture in my mind of something very specific.  This wasn't it.  It was 3 small pieces of \"meatloaf\".  It wasn't cut off a loaf and served; it was sliced, then had a dry rub on it and then cooked on each side (at least, that's what it seemed like).  I'm not a fan of their dry rub on the ribs, and this tasted very similar to that...all over.  It also had their tangy BBQ sauce underneath and on top of the pieces.  I guess I assumed the sauce would only be baked into the top crust, but it wasn't.  I ended up wiping the sauce off the pieces and trying to maintain the flavor of meatloaf.  I enjoy meatloaf, I enjoy the flavor of it, this didn't have any of that.  Luckily, the mashed potatoes went perfect with it, and I ended up eating both at the same time.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't horrible, it just wasn't what I was expecting.  And, since I was hungry, I ended up eating it all.  The shining star on my plate were the grilled zucchini...I could eat those all day.  We'll definitely be back again, and hopefully have Thomas as our waiter.  But, I won't be getting the meatloaf anytime soon.  I normally get their grilled salmon, which is always delicious.  But, decided to try something different this time...oh well."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with my meal and the complete general atmosphere of the restaurant. It was a Friday night but it wasn't actually all that busy. My fiancée and I wanted to go on a nice date and so we dove to Ruby Tuesday at Tempe Marketplace. To start off we were seated in a corner next to a HUGE party of screaming children running around and we were stuck  in the corner of their  craziness. So that started off our dinner with a nice loud screaming and our waitress could tell we really didn't want to be sitting there and there were plenty of other seats open (now after the experience we had, I understand why the restaurant was so empty on a Friday night) We ordered our drinks ( which mine was the only one refilled once cuz I guess the waitress forgot about us!) We ordered our meals which were the specials for a 3 course for 12.99. The salad bar was ok but nothing to brag about. My fiancée ordered the chicken which was overcooked and tasted terrible. He didn't even eat it. My steak was supposed to be medium done but it was well well done and very very dry. The when it was time to order our desserts and then informed us we had the choice of an item that was not advertised at all. Which was a dry bisquit with old strawberries on it. Our experience was just disappointing altogether. And yes I still left an 18% tip because I understand it isn't always the waitresses fault that the food and atmosphere is terrible. Save your money. Go to In and Out next time.  You will get way better food and you can expect the screaming children!"}
{"text":"They discontinued the biscuits, the prices are not competitive. I asked the hostess about their happy hour and she could not tell me about the happy hour specials. Therefore, we selected the dining room and our two meals (half rack of ribs) was $37.00 and not worth the price. This was most likely our last trip to Ruby Tuesday's."}
{"text":"I am raising my raising this time.  My server was excellent - salad bar was clean and full of freshness! My meal was great - had the pork chop! Location and parking both good too and restrooms were clean as well! If the service was any faster I'd be suspicious!"}
{"text":"Service was great.  Food was warm and greasy. Not typical I don't think but it was not good."}
{"text":"Came here because of reviews saying they have a great salad bar here.   However, they don't pay attention to the items at the salad bar. Leaving empty or almost empty bowls.   A few weeks ago I was at a Sizzler and was incredibly impressed by the hustle of the staff when it came to replenishing the salad bar. They were fantastic.   I would expect at least the same attention to detail, or more, that charges more for food.  Friend dining with me ordered a hamburger. Server asked him if he wanted \"everything\".  He said he did.   Burger arrives and there's no onions, mayo, mustard, etc. Evidently Ruby Tuesday's defines \"everything\" differently.   Weird thing.  Their napkins here are so cheap that you can see through them. What is up with that?  Lastly, ordered soup and the don't bring any Saltines or oyster crackers.  A person should get crackers when a single meal is $20."}
{"text":"My wife and I were staying in a nearby hotel and saw that Ruby Tuesday was within walking distance and thought we would grab a bite to eat. We were seated quickly and very soon our server arrived at our table to take our order. I ordered the Tempura green beans and was told that they were out of the beer batter to make them. On a Friday night? Really? My wife and I both ordered our meals which included salads. After waiting for some time with our server not checking in with us, he brought out our entrees. My wife inquired about our salads to which he replied \"Oh sh!t, I forgot about them\". He then brought our salads out and apologized but made no effort to make up for his error. Very disappointed with our visit to this Ruby Tuesday. Our food was OK but I couldn't get past the service (or lack of)."}
{"text":"Man I hate to leave bad reviews especially when it's my first time here. Well first off it's a small, clean place... hostess waitress and manager were friendly. I got a petite sirloin with salad bar, my boy got a cheeseburger and fries. I went to the salad bar and it was really hard for me to make a salad, they didn't have anything I liked... they grill or char the broccoli which honestly I've never tried it maybe it's good but I not appealing to the eyes... so I was disappointed but whatever. The food comes ok.. petite steak definitely petite with a side of mash potatoes that had like the edges of dried up flaky mash potatoes, I wasn't even gonna complain on it, I cut into my meat and wow, I asked for medium... and I got RARE and I mean RARE!  Now with that said I have been known to eat a rare steak but I literally have to be in the mood and today definitely not it made my stomach turn. I called the waitress over and she was gonna have it remade but literally lost my appetite so I declined. Josh the manager came over apologized asked if I want anything else I kindly said no thanks and he's telling me it's taken care of don't worry about it... which that's what you should do when your food is not right... he tells me feel free to eat more from the salad bar I just said ok cause literally I was thinking it was nasty. My kid ordered a burger and literally left it saying it was too greasy and yes dripping with grease. He took 2 bites and left it. 20 bucks I paid for us to both be grossed out leaving how we walked in hungry. My first and last time there."}
{"text":"Good service. Salad bar was pretty depressing I probably won't go back to this place for a salad."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst restaurants for service I have ever been to. we had a table of eight, ordered all our drinks at the same time and only got served one at a time with about 5 minutes in between each drink. Then we ordered appetizers, they only came out one at a time as well. When the waiter took our orders for dinner, he took half the tables order then walked away. We had to go and get him to get the rest of the orders placed at the same time. Then the meals only came out one at time, most of us finished eating our meal, before all meals where brought. And one meal was completely forgotten.  And most of the meals were cold . we  are never eating here again."}
{"text":"Ruby Tuesday's salad bar and healthier choices (With caloric count for calorie counters) for entrees is what sets it apart from other chain restaurants that serve your basic American style cuisine.  The salad bar includes 2 types of base greens (Iceberg and mixed greens), with various toppings (Edamame, peas, mushrooms, croutons etc.) and dressings (Italian, low fat balsamic, ranch, thousand island, etc).    Generally, with any main entree, you will have your choice of side and salad bar, or 2 sides.  They also have more healthy side options such as roasted spaghetti squash and steamed broccoli.  My husband had the chicken trio, and I had the creole fish on our visit.  The chicken was nicely presented, and was fairly tender and juicy.  Of the three different toppings (Balsamic and tomato, mushroom cheese, and mango salsa), my least favorite was the mango salsa since the mango in it, while fresh, wasn't totally ripe.  The creole fish was presented in a Spartan way, with just one piece of fish with a mound of side next to it on a plain white plate.  The fish (Some type of white fish, maybe carp?) was a freshwater white-flesh fish and had a decent seasoning and was cooked well.   Service was friendly, but we did not have any silverware on our table when we were seated and had to ask for it after our entrees were served to us.  Drinks were refilled quickly as needed.  I haven't indulged in a lot of the desserts, but I am a fan of the Italian creme cake.  It's moist, and not too sweet.    Prices are moderate, and entrees will be around 15 dollars, give or take a few dollars."}
{"text":"It is day 6 of my pursuit of not eating meat, so I stopped by Ruby Tuesday for a salad bar. The salad bar is usually decent, but I rarely go to Ruby Tuesdays. Being that I am planning on showing up for the PF Chang half marathon tomorrow, I thought a salad would be a good choice.  The menu has changed and was fairly big. There were some nice options pictured, but I already narrowed my search to salads. The salad bar is all you can eat for $7.99. Looking over the menu, I noticed a selection of mini sandwiches, including a veggie mini. When I asked our waiter what's the veggie mini like? Another waiter passing by said \"bad!\" - then I saw it - pimento cheese mini. Really? That's like 1978! The thing I noticed is the menu listed the price of the pimento minis at $6.99, and $7.99 with the salad. Having seen the salad bar was $7.99 itself, that means the pimento minis were free. And they came with a side a fries, so why not?   The plate came with 2 pimento minis and the fries. I had a good sized salad, so there was plenty of food for $7.99. One bite and I was instantly catapulted into my youth with gubment cheese, Vienna sausage and olive loaf. Nostalgic!  Overall the salad bar was very good, the pimento cheese as good as pimento cheese could be and the service was wonderful."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today with my lunch companion.  As usual, we walk in and there's no host at the podium, so we wait (strike one).  Then we were given very different menus so my lunch companion and I were confused for the first few minutes until we figured that out (strike 2).  Then I finally asked where the \"lunch\" menu was and was told that there were 3, yes three lunch options- 1 with red meat and 2 options for seafood, but no chicken option at all??!??  (strike 3)  So if you want chicken for lunch, be prepared to pay the full dinner price for it and get ready to have a $15+ lunch.  I'm sorry Ruby Tuesday, but this simply isn't acceptable.  Our waiter was kind and helpful and our food was tasty enough, but nothing that I'd return to get for LUNCH at those prices."}
{"text":"We love to come here for dinner, and had a good meal tonight! Everything was fine until the meal was over and the server refilled our drinks, then she disappeared.   We did not see her or the manager for over 20 minutes!  She showed up and apologized for the delay then I had to ask for the check which came right away.  She then disappeared again.   After Several minutes I spotted the manager on the other side of the bar and gave him the check and my card and asked him to process it. He brought it back and apologized for the wait, but my then my dinner companion had left and was texting me from the car."}
{"text":"I only gave it one star because the waitress gave us nice service, other than that said this place was awful.  I went for dinner with my husband, usually good the food is good but everything was dry and flavorless. The whole restaurant smelled musty and dirty, the restroom was dirty and when I walked out of it I saw most of the wait staff goofing off with the cooks. No wonder the food suffered. I can honestly say that I had the worst steak of my life there. I gave my husband a piece just to make sure it wasnt just me and he spit it out immediately. We have black listed that place and hopefully Gordon Ramsay will start helping large chain restaurants."}
{"text":"I drove past this morning,  and this location is now closed. First they closed the TGI Fridays,  then Applebees,  then Logans Roadhouse,  now this. We're running out of places to eat in the south Gilbert/Chandler area."}
{"text":"As a brand new aunt, Ruby Tuesdays looked like a nice place to meet my sister in law to see my new nephew but man o man was I ever wrong.  It took quite some time for the hostess to seat us. Once seated drink orders seemed to baffle our waiter.  And the service was very slow.  The prices have went up since the last time I visited.  And what's funny is the prices went up but the salad bar shrunk down....no fruit, almost no pasta,  only one type of cheese.....I mean they are known for there salad bar and it is mediocre at best and just like all the other comments we found the cucumbers soggy too.  The mashed potato was more like some kind of elementary school paste.  They were really just kind of gross.  In the end it took a party of 6 just over 1 hour and 45 mins to eat here on a Wednesday afternoon at 1 o'clock.  Needless to say if you read this far and you can't figure out if I'm recommending this place then let make it clear.....NO...don't waste your time or money....Ruby Tuesdays is not what it once was."}
{"text":"We had a great experience. We ordered the 3 courses for $12.99 and salad bar plus dessert came with it. My fiancé had sirloin and I had the chicken, both were tender and juicy. The manager walked around asking how everything was, which I feel all restaurant managers should do. The dessert was huge which surprised us. Other restaurant that have similar meals for a low price usually are small portions. Waitress was very attentive."}
{"text":"The food here is okay, there is nothing in particular that has ever impressed me. Not even anything uniquely bad  but nothing ever sticks out. I have eaten here a couple of times and though the service is good, the food just comes across as bland and boring, almost like everything is pre-packaged or came to the restaurant as frozen."}
{"text":"So my grandmother requested we go to Ruby Tuesdays for dinner last night - not my choice, but hey if it makes her happy I'll always go along with it.   I ordered the Cajun seafood  dish (broiled tilapia with sauteed shrimp and a parm sauce). I had to look that up on the menu because I am honestly shocked that was shrimp...in fact I am almost positive that they put the wrong type of meat on it because it tasted like severely  overcooked bitter lobster...it was something I ate because I came directly from work and was really hungry...and I feel bad complaining in front of my grandmother.    I ordered the side of mac n cheese and mashed potatoes with the meal ( yea super healthy...I know). The mashed potatoes were fine but the mac n cheese was way too rich for me- not horrible but I am not much for Velveeta and it was along those lines. I actually ended up giving it to  my grandmother to take home as I knew it wasn't something id eat.  The server wasn't rude - but wasn't friendly really either...I would say quite unenthusiastic sums her up.   I added on the plus one star because the manager came over to us and offered a bogo coupon which was very nice.   I am positive I would not go here on my own accord....100% positive."}
{"text":"The Last Ruby Tuesday Standing in Las Vegas :  In anticipation of sharing the places and restaurants that I visited in Denver this past week on Yelp, this will be my last Las Vegas review for a few weeks. And speaking of \"last,\" this review is a recollection of my experience dining in the \"last\" Ruby Tuesday in Las Vegas.   Unlike the famous 1967 Rolling Stones song that this chain is named after, Ruby Tuesday has lost popularity. As far as number of locations, the chain is a shadow of its former self. Just last year in 2016, Ruby Tuesday announced they were shutting 95 locations. It's a shame because when I was a teenager living on Long Island, Ruby Tuesday was a popular and growing chain offering good Americana food with the famous all you can eat salad bar. Ironically, when my hometown Ruby Tuesday came to Lake Grove, NY in the late 1990s it was a Red Robin that they replaced. In contrast to the dismal corporate developments that I mentioned in this paragraph, the last Ruby Tuesday standing in Las Vegas is an upbeat casual dining restaurant that may have you singing \"Ruby Tuesday.\"   A couple of Saturdays previous, my brother and I decided to dine here after hiking up in Mount Charleston. It had been a decade when I last had Ruby Tuesday back on Long Island.   When I walked inside, right in front of me stood the all you can eat salad bar. Right in front of you will stand the all you can eat salad bar in one of the photographs below. The all you can eat salad bar is the centerpiece of one of the two rooms that make up the restaurant. When I looked to the left of the salad bar, there was a view of Craig Ranch Regional Park. When I looked to the right, the enthusiastic hostess greeted us to Ruby Tuesday faster than my eyes took in the salad bar.   The neat aspect of the last Ruby Tuesday in Las Vegas is that it has a mom and pop vibe more than a cookie cutter chain restaurant vibe. It's as if Ruby Tuesday's cream of the crop represented the restaurant. If you were to look up \"friendly server\" in the encyclopedia Jessica. M would be an example. From the time we were seated to the time I left with \"Ruby Tuesday\" playing in my head, Jessica. M  provided outstanding service from topping off refills to volunteering expertise on food selections. For example, she let us know that Ruby Tuesday is known for their ribs and burgers. I'd heed her recommendation. If there were more servers with Jessica M's attitude, perhaps Ruby Tuesday would be opening 95 restaurants a year.   We sat in the second of the two rooms. This dimly lit room overlooked the bar. In place of a view of Craig Ranch Regional Park was one of Professional sports on the TVs above.   The vast menu offered pages of dining and drinking choices. Jessica M's recommendation simplified the decision making. I opted for the USDA Mushroom Swiss Burger with fries. I passed over the additional $3.99 all you can eat salad bar. My taste buds were agreeable to the burger. The thick burger tasted as if it just came off a barbecue grill. The complimentary ingredients including mushrooms, onions, lettuce, and mustard complimented the barbecue taste of the thick burger. Sharing the plate the fries tasted better than average. With a bottomless Coke that Jessica. M was quick to top off, the dining experience came out to $14.58 before the tip.   After leaving Ruby Tuesday in the dawn, I could of been singing another Rolling Stones song called \"This Could Be the Last Time.\" On account of the fact that this is the last Ruby Tuesday remaining in Las Vegas and that they are shutting down so many stores this could be my last time here. However, this shouldn't be the case. From my experience, this is a well managed restaurant with an attentive and enthusiastic server that delivered tasty Americana food to my table in an upbeat restaurant that left me with a good taste and good tune: \"Ruby Tuesday.\""}
{"text":"This place is inconsistent. Every time we come here the quality is different. The burgers used to be delicious and most recently they waver. They do have great discounts- which is what keeps us coming back. The biscuits they give are also very tasty."}
{"text":"I was meeting a friend for dinner.  This location was perfect and with a choice of many restaurants, we decided to meet at Ruby Tuesday.  I had remembered Ruby Tuesday had a salad and that sounded good to me at first.  We were a little surprised at the prices on the menu.  They were much higher than expected.  Wow.  They did offer a 3-course special that included salad bar, entree and dessert for $13.99.  We both chose that with the sirloin steak.  The salad bar was good but we've seen so much better.  It was a little disappointing for the offerings but it worked fine as an add-on to a meal.  The steaks were cooked perfectly and they were absolutely delicious.  We had no complaint with the food.  One drink at the table was ordered and needed to be returned because it was pretty watered down.  Server was pretty good.  It's definitely an A-OK restaurant but we weren't real pleased with the menu offerings for dinner. I doubt we'll be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"First time here and we decided to give a try and they seated us soon we got their and place was slow and the food was good I enjoy mines and my Mac & cheese and hubby had the steak but he said they didn't cook it right so he didn't eat much but other then that it was good not bad and place is clean and staff is friendly and don't mind stopping by again they had cheese cake that I wanted too try but I was full lol"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's hardly ever busy and the servers are very attentive. The bartender and manager are very friendly and helpful. Ruby Tuesday used to have sub-par food, but their new menu is full of great-tasting fare. The portion sizes are huge! This place is definitely a good value for money.  As for the guy who ordered the \"Pittsburgh rare black and blue\" steak, seriously? Ruby Tuesday has steak, but is NOT a steakhouse. Its a mid-priced casual dining restaurant. What you asked for is not even on the menu. If your expectations are that specific, go somewhere that specializes in what you desire."}
{"text":"First & Last time here!!  Menu pricey for a selections they offer !! Entree $16 and up which is fine, however most entrees usually come with a salad but here ( pay extra 1.99 you get house salad  or for and additional $3.99 you get they're not so fabulous 55 items of crap salad bar!!  We both ordered burger( well done ) I received a raw one needless to say lost my appetite !!  The only good thing about this restaurant was the staff very friendly and accommodating!"}
{"text":"I was staying in town locally and stopped by for take out.  And ordered a drink while I waited. Food arrived quickly and my drink was made perfectly. The location of this place is perfect to on and off highway.  The food was wonderful and the staff great !"}
{"text":"Horrible service! Called for a to go order for one sandwich with broccoli. I was told it would be 10 mins and I ended up waiting almost 30 mins. I wasn't even acknowledged for a while when I was waiting at the bar. A couple came in after me looking around asking if there was even a bartender. I told them that I was waiting and haven't been helped yet. I was finally greeted and when I told her I had a to go order, instead of looking for it or letting me pay she immediately goes to the couple that came in after me to greet and help them. I finally got my food and it was messed up! I told the bartender and she asked me if I just wanted to keep it. Of course not! I had to wait again to get my order fixed and she didn't even apologize. She said \"here you go\" and walked away. Rude."}
{"text":"GOOD BYE RUBY TUESDAY & GOOD RIDDEN.   Your customer service is the worst!!!!  You made a mistake ran someone else's ticket and my ticket $78 IN CHARGES... I can't get my own money back for three days.  Well apparently you don't care because all of your restaurants are being sold because the real estate is more valuable.  PATRONS BEWARE!  Yes, everyone makes mistakes.   So tell me how do you run two different tickets with the same card.  And why can't you bring me my money???  33 mile drive each way for business lunch.  HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF SOMEONE STOLE 45.22 out of your pocket and said... well thats ok you can have it back in 3-4 business days."}
{"text":"Only reason They get a star is because the food was good. The rest....forget it!!!  Slooooow service, food brought out one at a time, waitress said the kitchen was a little slow....A LITTLE????   Try forever! Our party of 8, 3 orders were wrong.  One party got only noodles, they brought a plate with them stuck together in a clump....about a whole cups worth!  One party ordered petite sirlon, PETITE is right!  About a whole 3 b!tes and totally overdone! One ordered a triple prime steak burger, he got a hamburger.  Ridiculous!  Won't be back to this Ruby's EVER!"}
{"text":"Ruby Tuesday has really upped their salad bar game!  I mean, their croutons have always been amazing (and still are), but they have added a lot more items such as roasted broccoli, pasta salads and more! I highly recommend getting the salad bar anytime you eat here!  I also have figured out, what I think is the BEST DEAL if you want to get the salad bar.  Ruby Tuesday has a happy hour everyday in the bar section from 3:00-7:00.  In addition to drink specials there are select appetizers for $4.  Getting the salad bar on it's own costs $9.99, but if you get a happy hour appetizer for $4.00, you can add the salad bar for $3.99, so that's $8.00 total for more food!   On my last trip I fully took advantage of this deal.  I went with my sister and her husband and we each shared an appetizer and got the salad bar.  The appetizers were the tempura green beans, spinach artichoke dip, and crispy chicken bites.  The spinach artichoke dip was my favorite, but they all were yummy! I would definitely suggest going and getting in on this deal!"}
{"text":"I've not been to Ruby Tuesdays in some time I always loved their salad bar . I called in a burger an fries for lunch an picked it up. Fast service first I just ordered online n it gave me a time I'd be ready . I walked in an they had it ready to go an I had asked for mayo/mustard she said put 2 containers in ur box for you. This burger was so good cooked just as I ordered . I'll b back for another burger"}
{"text":"We go here often and always had a great experience! I usualy get a blackened fish and my husband ribs. We both enjoy our choices. The best thing is the salad bar that both our kids enjoy! Although the last time we went they did not have feta cheese anymore there were still a ton of options that my kids did enjoy... The service was pretty fast as well! We like Ruby Tuesday!"}
{"text":"A friend and I had dinner here over the weekend before catching a show at Gammage. We were debating between this and Thirsty Lion, but I wanted to eat light and indulge in the salad bar so we decided on RT. We walked in and it was nearly empty. We were seated right away and quickly decided on what we wanted. I had the mini sliders and salad bar and we shared the four variety appetizer. The app was huge easily shared by 3-4 people, and we didn't finish it all. We visited the salad bar which was okay, nothing that wowed me, though everything I had was fresh. The rest of my meal came with two sliders and fries. We could have easily done without the appetizer and had lots of food leftover. Everything was just okay though. I can't say I'll be running back here"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great prices, friendly attentive staff. Exactly what I'm looking for in casual fast eating. Would absolutely go back again!"}
{"text":"I know, I know, this is a fast-casual chain, but it wasn't half bad! Had lunch there with my family before heading to the airport to come back to the Bay. I gotta love a place with a regular old-fashioned salad bar, and it was unlimited including 3 side dishes off the menu for $8.99. Everybody else had some really good looking food and there were no complaints. Service was very good too. Overall as a restaurant, not as good as BJ's but better than Fridays or Applebees IMHO."}
{"text":"Normally I give this place 5 stars. Great service. Love the salad bar. I always get coupons by email. But tonight?  Nope. Customer service blows. They redid the chick tender batter and was literally falling off the chicken. I tried one and told my waitress I didn't like it at all. It tastes like tempura. Well then she brings the bill with the tenders still on it. Maybe it's just me but normally they should take the meal off. So I waited. And waited the waitress finally came over and I asked. She takes the bill and takes forever to come back only to say that they will take the chicken off but now charge me $9 for the side salad. Waited again. Finally somewhat got it sorta because I made them take a coupon. Like I said normally love this place but either the manager was a twit (never came by the table) or the server was new."}
{"text":"walked In for lunch today and as soon as I walked in the door the smell of sewage wafted out of the restaurant.  I told the hostess about it then walked out."}
{"text":"Ruby Tuesday is the only place I've been so far that knows how to take a coupon correctly. That being said, the burgers don't travel well and the online ordering system didn't work so there go my TueGo dreams I guess. Did two transactions because I had a free $11 burger for my birthday and a 20% off code for everything else. Even at the price I paid the food was kind of \"bleh\", expected more because of the hype but nothing special."}
{"text":"When it comes to lunch in North Las Vegas, there are a few things I try to do: Stay away from fast food.  Eat something reasonably healthy.  Keep lunch cheap.  Surprisingly, I've been able to do those things at Ruby Tuesday!  I've always sat at the bar during lunch and ordered an entree; I haven't done the salad bar.  While sitting at the bar, the bartender gave me a card that gets me $2 off my lunch at the bar if I pay with a card.  I've been ordering entrees from their petite lunch menu, which is a smaller (and cheaper!) serving than the regular dish.  Each petite lunch is $8-$9, so after that sweet $2 discount you're looking at a $6-$7 entree at a sit down restaurant!  It seems that nowadays you'll be spending that much for a combo meal at a fast food spot.  I've had the chicken lunch and the cajun fish lunch, and both are decent meals for the price point.  They come with a side of mashed potatoes and broccoli, and the portion is enough to keep you going until dinner time.  The fish has been overseasoned before, but it's not a regular thing.  If you can relate to the first paragraph in this review, consider Ruby Tuesday a solid choice for lunch in North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I wasn't a very big fan of Ruby Tuesday's, but I am still sad to see it closed, just another Mill Ave memory. The salad bar was sub par at best, but they did have decent turkey burgers. They had really cheap drinks for happy hour, but the atmosphere in the place was so crappy it wasn't worth chugging them down there. I'm surprised Ruby held on as long as she did on Mill."}
{"text":"I heart Ruby Tuesday.  I really do.    It seems like a Chili's or TGIFriday's but it's SO much better that that.  They have an extensive Burger list and all that I have tried were amazing.  I wish that I lived closer to one...or maybe not because then I would go there all of the time.  Also, kudos to them for offering endless fries..not that i have ever been hungry enough to take them up on that..."}
{"text":"I will never go to this location again. My husband and I went in at around 12 or 1 for lunch. Went we got there we were greeted and sat quickly. It look a really long time for our waiter to come like 10 almost 15 mins. When he finally came we ordered our drinks and by that time we already knew what we wanted to eat so we ordered that to. It took so long for our drinks that we went to the salad bar and still didn't have them when we came back. We had them almost the same time as our food. The food was cold and our drinks were gross I ordered a peach lemonade and it didn't have any flavor it was like drinking water. The salad bar looked horrible and the salad wasn't good. I will be going to a different location."}
{"text":"Update 2017:  Other visits after my initial review haven't been as pleasant.  This is still a solid location but the salad bar hasn't been as impressive as of late and I had a few too many so-so entrees    As far as Ruby Tuesday goes, I think this one is pretty solid.  The salad bar is mostly fresh and replenished often, the entrees are tasty and the service is quite prompt.  I don't have any complaints!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit but not our last.  We were greeted promptly and seated right away.  The restaurant was clean and very relaxing.  Our server, Deon H., was OUTSTANDING.  He was friendly and professional.  He made a couple of recommendations which we ordered and he was Spot-On!!  I highly recommend the Hickory Pork Chop with Mashed Potato's and Green Beans.  He was very attentive and never rushed us.  It was a relaxing meal and the noise level was very low which made our table conversation super.  Keep up the great work and we will be back."}
{"text":"Food and service on point! There were 11 of us, weren't sure how it would turn out because we've been to too many places that couldn't keep up with a party this size, even with 2 wait, and a busser... had 1 waitress and no busser and she kept up with us. Definitely coming back. Thank you :)"}
{"text":"I used to go to this location a few years ago when I lived in the area. A few days ago I saw a Ruby Tuesday ad in a magazine I was reading and got some family together for dinner last night. Our waiter was Jameson (named after the whiskey I hope) and even though he had a few tables was quick to fill drinks and see if we needed anything. I ordered some kind of white fish with mashed cauliflower with the salad bar added on. The food was all great (having a few vodka tonics earlier may have helped) and the iced tea I ordered had perfect flavor.   4 1/2 stars easily."}
{"text":"I like a well kept salad bar and this Ruby Tuesday does a good job of keeping up their salad bar. For lunch, get there closer to 11am for the freshest possible bar. They have a mysterious ham looking meat type item on the bar. Some day maybe I'll ask what that is but I'm not sure I really want to know.  At $9, it's a bit pricy...... but add on their $3 ice tea and a tip; and suddenly.......this is an expensive salad lunch. It makes more sense if you really want salad and your really hungry.  And if your up for a large salad, ask your server for a large/square plate and avoid the standard tiny size plate.  One last thing; if you like the biscuits at Red Lobster,  you'll probably like these. There's a very similar version here."}
{"text":"Love this place, had their typhoon shrimp and their bacon cheeseburger. Didn't finish the food but definitely a two thumbs up.  Quality of food was 5 star, service was 3 1/2 star.  The type of bread they used for the burger was similar to a croissant :)"}
{"text":"Horrible. Poor management that cannot manage her team. Had to go to the hostess stand anytime we needed anything. They don't serve biscuits anymore. Go to Logan's."}
{"text":"well when this restaurant first opened up, the salad bar was amazing...with lots of fruit...now the salad bar was little or nothing, not worth the $9.00 price tag.  the food here was just okay and average nothing to write home about.  the prices are a bit high for the boring level of food... the bacon burger was just okay...pretty boring food, nothing even worth mentioning.  They need to go back to how they operated and the food levels they had when they first opened."}
{"text":"I really do love this place. It's definitely changed over the years but they still offer the same great salad bar and fun fruity drinks. Came here on Mother's day and it was extremely packed. I was with a party of 4 and we got sat right away which was awesome. Our servers name was Gillian and she had a great personality. Our drink orders were taken quickly along with our food orders. The food was delicious and she checked on us a good amount of times. I really like this restaurant and I've never been let down by the food, staff or cleanliness.   Try it here"}
{"text":"It's been over a year since i have been here. I stopped going because of the number of processed foods and I didn't trust the freshness nor the ingredients  I heard they had a new fresh menu. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and selection  The salad bar is still here. The items are still varied and this visit they were very fresh.  There are plenty of new items (check the photos and website) I had the spaghetti squash and it was wonderful. Very fresh, cooked on location and served hot. Yummy I'll be back to try other things. You should try it again if you haven't tried it in awhile"}
{"text":"Took my wife for dinner and will definitely not return.  Food was overcooked, and not worth the price. Service was ok, but you could tell he did not want to be there. Very little effort to provide customer service.  I do not recommend."}
{"text":"I like this place only for a quick beer after work. They serve it cold. Ambiance is nill. We were in there yesterday for an over priced salad bar with my coworkers. It was just ok.  Than, we were handed a review sheet with some twenty questions. The second question had to do with a list of items; shrimp and avocado etc. none of which were served. I won't be back."}
{"text":"My latest experiences at TR were very positive.  The Bourbon Salmon was 'to die for'!  Very succulent and cooked right.  Portions have gotten bigger too.  And the salad bar was very clean and well kept.  The key to ANY decent salad bar is getting there early, before all the slobs and neanderthals have had a chance to 're-arrange' everything.  And before some of these troglodytes have had a chance to touch the large scoop spoons, presumably after changing the oil on their Camaros, or after scratching their balls or armpits!  You get my point...  Lastly, someone should tell the employees there NOT to spray their chemical cleaner spray bottles on tabletops, because much of the fine mist goes into the air, where nearby patrons breathe in the toxins!  You would think this is obvious!  UPDATE January 2015:  I have to detract 2 stars, going from 4 down to 2.  This place has a SERIOUS problem with their spray cleaner and window cleaner bottles!  Recently, I was having a pleasant meal there when I observed an employee liberally spraying the glass hood right above the salad bar!  Without question, much of the spray landed on the food below!  Granted, this was a few minutes before closing time, but I still observed 3 people use the salad bar shortly after they sprayed that area!  This is unacceptable.  I don't ever think I want to go back there again, ever.  UPDATE January 2018:  \"Honey they shrunk the portions!\"  I have been a customer here for probably more than a decade now, and for the first time, my salmon portion and broccoli was half of what it used to be!  This seems endemic to many places today.  You pay more, and get less!  I'm done with this place, and this time I mean it."}
{"text":"First of all let me say this. We love this restraurant. The food is good quality for the price . The fish is always light and flavorful ! The salad  bar has over 55 ingredients  that u can pick and chose. The ribs are good .  The service is awesome . All the people are super nice and helpful. The gm PJ is the bomb . Always asking if everything is good !  The location has some challenges beginning close to light rail.however we always feel safe !!!"}
{"text":"Very impressed.  Service was wonderful.  Salad bar was fresh, not a large selection but very good.  Shrimp fondue - wonderful.  Blackened Talipia - wonderful.  Rib-eye steak - wonderful.  Price - very good.  Had not eaten at a Ruby Tuesdays in years, and was very impressed.  Will go back."}
{"text":"The food is the last of my concerns with this establishment. My biggest issue is in regard to their understaffed agenda, and their extreme mistreatment of their staff. Their was a wait of over 40 mins on a Saturday night, tables available, but not enough servers to seat. The employees that were their couldn't hardly pay attention to anything because they all had 3 people's worth of work to do. And to make matters worse, I heard 2 seperate employees crying, distinctively. I couldn't feel worse for the employees who are forced to bear these conditions, and I will not be returning to eat here again. In my opinion, Ruby Tuesdays should be shut down, or forced to appropriate their labor to a viable amount of employees every day. They are nothing short of a slave-trade business. Absolutely awful."}
{"text":"I went here a couple nights ago with my boyfriend, everyone was so nice. But the decor was so different from the Ruby Tuesdays that I am use to, so is the atmosphere. It use to be like a sports bar, now I get a Dennys Ihope kinda feel. The food was very tasty but I will not come back. Just not my scene lol"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Salad bar was good which is why I gave it 2 stars. I ordered the ribs and my wife ordered the salmon. Ribs were ok but side of green beans were undercooked and onion rings were cold. Wife's salmon was over cooked and very dry. Our waitress brought our food off and we didn't see her again until she dropped check off. She asked how things were going. We told her we would like our drinks refilled and told her about the problems with our food. She didn't seem to care. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"I am not one to go to chain restaurants but when traveling I often do not have much choice.  This particular Ruby Tuesdays had a very friendly and polite staff, everything else was sub-par as was expected of a typical chain.  So, basically if your stuck in the kannapolis/concord area and need to eat go to Ruby Tuesday for if nothing else but to support their staff."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here yesterday for Easter. We anticipated a long wait, but were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away. I've been to RT before in other states and was blown away by the extensive salad bar not at this location. Basic and limited vegetable options. When my entree arrived it looked like the food slid around because it looked messy. The bottom and sides of the plate had food, granted it was my food spilled around, but it simply looked messy. Our waiter was attentive and professional. We went here because we had 2 gift cards. We tipped him the remaining balance which was generous and we will not be back."}
{"text":"Going up, on a Tuesday! They need to add that jingle to their commercials.   I really like the service here, they are very nice and attentive.  Food is decent, better than I thought it would be, and they have a great salad bar, I feel that it's an upscale Sizzler and I love Sizzler   Also they send you a lot of freebies and coupons :)"}
{"text":"Per usual....and just like my review of this same restaurant last year..... sad and sloppy looking salad bar (see pictures I posted for evidence).  There is no one dining in the restaurant and the place is a wreck....the service is painfully slow and unattentive....and morale seems low.    Restaurants should not feel and look like this to diners....especially if they are not busy.  In my opinion, if you got time to lean.....you got time to clean.    Step up your game RT......the food tasted fine.....but that's not what the entire experience is about."}
{"text":"Ok before i moved to AZ i used to see these commercials on all the time and i always wanted to go there. So when i found out there was one next to me we went straight there. This place is great i had the Smokehouse Burger man that was a great burger I loved this place wish they had one out here"}
{"text":"I would probably give the 3 previous Ruby Tuesday's that I went to before this one a 2 star review but this one actually came through.  A couple years ago RT's went through a menu change and price increase, where it seemed like they were trying to get more 'fancy pants' on me but decreasing the amount of fries, veggies, etc. that would come out on their new plates.  I really hated this direction only because RT's used to be my lunch staple in Michigan when I wanted a burger or spicy chicken sandwich.    So I'm a sucker for a coupon.  RT's sent me a buy one get one and I bought.  Since I was doing volunteer work at the pet store in the same parking lot, I just figure why not!  If it sucks, I'm out $20 but with a full belly for me and my friend.  To my surprise, both meals were exceptionally good.  The bar and restaurant were busy.  The drinks were good too, think it was a happy hour special but I'll take it.  Nice work RT!  If I'm in the area, I  WILL stop in again to make sure nothings changed.  FYI - There really isn't much in that area.  Giovanni's, Hyde Park, and PF Changs is up the street but nothing else in that general area if you live west on Chagrin Rd.  Is Bennihana's even still open....lol?"}
{"text":"If you've been to a Ruby Tuesday this one is pretty similar. I came here for the salad bar, as that's usually why I go to a Ruby Tuesdays. It's been a while since I've been to one, but I read some reviews for this RT and I thought it was worth the walk from my hotel. The salad bar was indeed different then I remember from other RT. They had hummus, some pastas, and fresh, tasty veggies.   The service was great, attentive, without pushing the add ons which was nice. I'm mostly plant based and really the only reason I come to RT is for the salad bar. The rest typically (except some sides) don't mesh with my dietary needs. So I am thankful for the salad bar and that they don't push add on items to me that I do not care to eat.   The only drawback of the salad bar in my opinion is the small containers for the veggies. It makes it somewhat difficult to keep the veggies on your plate and not spilling over into the neighboring containers. Not really a big deal, but I don't want to make a mess for the other patrons. Just food for thought.   The restaurant was clean, well lit, and they had TVs in the bar area which is nice for diners eating alone. I'm in the Cleveland area hit and miss, and I'll surely visit this RT again when I'm in want of a decent salad bar at a good price."}
{"text":"I wish there were negative stars to choose from. The food was  absolutely terrible! Steak overcooked (not a big deal, it happens) lobster tail overcooked and looked like it had been reheated from earlier today, or yesterday. Tilapia didn't even taste like fish, more like burnt soap? I had my bf taste it just to make sure it wasn't only me and he tried drowning it in butter but still didn't help. We hadn't been back to Ruby Tuesday in about 6 years because we didn't like the food back then. I kind of thought since they were still open that maybe they had changed? Nope! Still just as bad if not worse. Will not be going back again. I'm really not that picky about food and if I get shrimp and lobster I'm usually a very happy camper. My seafood trio came with 3 shrimp (lol) and I only ate 2 of them. At least I ordered the baked potato and had something to eat for my $20 meal. I thought our server should have asked why I didn't want a box when most of my meal was still on the plate but didn't, and didn't bother to take any plates away at all! Very disappointed and disgusted."}
{"text":"No cheese on my wife's cheeseburger, no bacon on my bacon cheeseburger.  Mine initially came out dripping blood from being undercooked, which they fixed but returned on the same soggy bun.  Kids meals are 5$, plus another $1.50 for a kids milk which I thought was high.  Overall, overpriced for terrible quality.  Would recommend to nobody."}
{"text":"Such a awesome meal!! Service was amazing! Andrew was the best! A+! Seriously if you ever get the chance to go there ask for him! He literally makes the experience great, fantastic personality :)"}
{"text":"Came here a couple nights ago with my family. My wife had a coupon which was the reason for the visit. The atmosphere was non existent as there were only 2 other people in the restaurant when we got here and it was 6:30 PM! I was pretty excited about the sign on the door for drink specials for happy hour but found out when we got the bill that it's only if you sit at the bar. Waiter was very inattentive. Food was ok, wife had a burger, kids had Mac and cheese and I had wings. My wife thought the burger was good. The wings were almost inedible as they were completely drowned in sauce."}
{"text":"Food was ok. My burger was slightly undercooked for my liking, the salad bar needed maintenence and the server seemed uninterested in delivering a good experience. The fries were the best I have had at a Ruby's. We even timed it before the restaurant got busy thinking that would help, only thing the employees were busy with was hurling by the bar for gossip hour."}
{"text":"Service is great.  Floor and carpets are sticky.  Food is good.  We've been here a couple of times and will keep coming back. Best sit down option in the vicinity."}
{"text":"So I only gave it 1 star cause that is required but this place is one I'll never return to by choice again. I have been to other Ruby Tuesday locations it was phenomenal but this one was terrible. First the waitress wasn't that nice. Also the food took forever like over 30 minutes from when we ordered the only reason we survived was the appetizer which was pretty good it was spinach and artichoke dip also I had the unlimited harder salad bar and it was good but was not as good as it written to be in my opinion also from when we ordered till we got the food (30 minutes) the waitress never came back or checked on us.  The food wasn't good my chicken was way to small and a tad bland and my girlfriend's burger was terrible over cooked. This location is a no go!"}
{"text":"The food is consistently good but not amazing. We started out with the appetizer sampler which came with wings, an eggroll, fried mozzarella, celery, and chicken tenders as well as sauces to go with each.  I got the glazed salmon with spaghetti squash as a side. Salmon was cooked well considering it was probably frozen but the squash was drenched in butter which made me kinda angry because I only ordered squash as an effort to be healthy.  Someone else got a full rack of ribs that were pretty tender. Side of green beans was also drenched in butter.  Pro tip - order the salad bar as your second side and that can serve as your appetizer as you can get that first thing. It's a buffet, not extensive options but fresh ingredients and yummy broccoli salad. Basically, you can't really complain but don't expect anything mind blowing. Service was slow - obviously understaffed. We had to wait ~10 minutes even though there were a ton of empty tables because they didn't want the servers to be overwhelmed."}
{"text":"We returned last night. The staff was very nice. I opted for the blackened Talapia with the yummy asparagus and stuck with the salad bar this time. I only eat the heads of my asparagus, I had a nice salad and I was still not able to eat the full portion of the fish. So I had to leave that behind. (Not good reheated in microwave at hotel) we did however order the pineapple upside down to go. We were not going to pass that up again! When unloading our bag we noticed that they had warmed it up AND THERE WAS ICE CREAM for the top. Yay we have a freezer in our room. Oh yeah... And it was mighty tasty, by the way .. Thank you RT. We're here till next Friday. I'm sure we'll be back. It's great food and so convenient right across the street where we're staying."}
{"text":"Not up to Ruby Tuesday standards, greasy burger, dull dry fries, ribs decent but greasy too. Service was okay but not worth $ 43 tab for wife and I, she was not happy."}
{"text":"OK,it's been 8 years since I last came here,and it was so bad then We just never went back.We wanted a fresh salad and had heard the salad bar was pretty good,so why not,right?The salad was pretty good,but we had Dustin as a waiter and he was bad (really,really bad).The experience as a whole convinced me to never return.If the whole dining experience is important to you,then skip this place and go to my favorite chain restaurant in Gastonia,NC Cheddar's.Bonus:For great service asked to be in Kim's section."}
{"text":"Good meal and exceptional service thanks Becka you were the best server I have had in a long time"}
{"text":"Soooooo.....this place sucks. We came in and the hostess was confused as to why we were there. Very weird encounter....Anyways, she finally got a clue and we were seated. We were really only coming for dessert but decided to get an appetizer. The appetizer  took forever to come and when it did....yuck! It was a big dipper sampler. The chicken was not done, it was gummy. The sauce on the fries was disgusting. The spring rolls were just okay. However, the mozzarella sticks were delicious. So finally what we were all waiting for...ok me.... The blondie! What in the world has Ruby Tuesday done to this recipe??? Did they change vendors?...idk.  It was disgusting. It was like a big chunk of cake. It wasn't warm. It wasn't tasty. I won't be back. The food was already subpar, now you've messed up the dessert. Oh, I gave two stars because the waiter was nice and efficient."}
{"text":"A day out with our 7.5 year old nephew and we tired him out!  It was a fun-filled day with his Uncle and Auntie in Vegas and we did it all - black light miniature golf at King Putt, Tater Tots with cheese (his favorite) from Sonic Drive-In, jumping around to pure exhaustion at Sky Zone Indoor Trampoline Park, a new shirt from Old Navy, and driving the cars at Las Vegas Mini Gran Prix Family Fun Center.  Now, we needed to end his day on a high note and where else could we get a good mac 'n cheese that would satisfy a kid's craving?  We're in luck - Ruby Tuesday offers just that and I had a coupon for BOGO free entree!  Sweet!  The Husband orders their Signature Item - the Classic Barbecue Baby Back Ribs (Half Rack) \"Our half-rack slow-cooked for hours then covered with our tangy barbecue sauce.\" It comes with two Signature sides - he chose the Baked Potato and Baked Mac 'n Cheese ($1 extra).  Although one wishes for meat to be tender, he wished the meat didn't fall off so easily .    I ordered one of their Signature Items - the Parmesan Shrimp Pasta \"Tender, spicy shrimp are seasoned and sautéed, then served over penne pasta in Parmesan cream sauce and accented with diced tomatoes.\" which was creamy and heavy!  Generous portion!   And of course, our nephew ordered from the Kids Menu (10 and under) -  Kids' Mac 'n Cheese Pasta, which came with your choice of beverage.  Being the great kid he is, he asked for milk with it!  The best part was when his order arrived, he asked if he could extra cheese.  I asked him from where and he mentioned that he saw shredded cheese over at the salad bar.  We asked the waitress and she brought over a little container of cheese for him and he was just so pleased!  As he devoured his favorite meal - he finished up his milk and asked for another!  (What a kid!)  Service was attentive and when our waitress was busy, another waitress would cover for her - they definitely work as a team there.  Be sure to ask for the Made-From-Scratch Garlic Cheese Biscuits - we had to ask for ours."}
{"text":"I arrived to this location at 1:50pm to meet with an important colleague of mine. There weren't very many guests in the building at all at that time. My food took 50 minutes to arrive and was made incorrectly because they were out of certain ingredients.  My guest had to get back to work and wasn't even able to eat her lunch having to take it to go.  Very embarrassing as this was her first time dining at this establishment.  This made me look bad as well. When the manager Stephanie came over to talk to me she was terrible and didn't even seem like she cared giving me excuses instead of solutions. She didn't even apologize for the delay either. She also explained to me how their restaurant is always an hour wait and takes 45 minutes to get entrees since they're the only restaurant in the area. She told me not to come here for lunch anymore if I am on a time crunch for lunch. I will not be coming back to this restaurant and will let my colleagues know just how awful this location is."}
{"text":"First time ever eating at a Tuesday's. Man this place was good, order the chicken tortilla soup."}
{"text":"We are fans of Ruby Tuesday. Love their sliders and really love their hamburgers on the pretzel roll. Then to top it off you hit the salad bar which has a nice variety of toppings and pasta.   The food is always awesome and the servers always are very welcoming."}
{"text":"I was surprised.  I did not like this restaurant for several years.  Nothing in particular, just never thought it was good.    I heard and saw that they have revamped the menu and decor so I decided to give it another try.    I decided on the salad bar.  It was actually filling and had several options of toppings.    I would go here again and try something different next time.   Oh and the flavored teas were great, blueberry, strawberry, peach and mango."}
{"text":"We enjoyed dining at this location. The staff was all very pleasant and welcoming. Prices are decent and the food is good! Staff is always attendant to the salad bar and never rolls an eye when you ask for fresher veggies."}
{"text":"I don't know what is up with this Ruby's. I have had very good experiences at other locations but from now on I avoid this one.   The server never came back to check on us, I asked for my burger medium rare and it was well done, and the waiter kept making weird comments to people at our table. For the price of the meal I would have been better off staying home and wouldn't have had to put up with such awful service."}
{"text":"Very quick and unpleasant experience. Stopped here to eat one Sunday night. Stood at the door for about 7 minutes until we were told that it would be about a 15-20 wait because there weren't enough servers. The place was empty and tables weren't cleaned off from previous diners. Having been in the food service industry, these things happen- you get slammed and try to recover, especially on a typically slow Sunday night. We sat at the bar, figured we'd order something to take out...two bartenders, both saw us sit down, continued to do the task they were doing- backs toward us. Previous experiences being a bartender - acknowledge the customer \" I'll be right with you guys\" and continue what you were doing. So after blankly staring at the menu, still no service, we left. It was all around pretty uncomfortable"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a Saturday afternoon with a good friend and my mom.  Friend ordered a burger, mom and I split sampler platter.  Waiter was \"new\" and didn't enter both as entrees so our food was our way before the burger.  Manager came o effort and apologized, said it was entered as an app and meal.  He comp'd the burger but not a positive experience.  We received gift cards from family back east or probably wouldn't have gone here for dinner.  Went on a Saturday night after son's baseball games.  It was about 7-7:30 the next Saturday night after review above (a week later) Four of us - all ordered bacon cheese burgers 3 medium rare, 1 medium well.  I also ordered an up sized sangria.  Sangria finally shies up and has so many muddled berries that the straw could barely be used and if you could get anything through the straw it was nothing but muddled berry seeds.  They remade it saying they use fresh fruit.  At least I could drink the replacement.   Took a long time before burgers finally showed up.  The medium well burger (husband's) looked rare so I swapped with my husband. Mine was well done rather than med rare.  Turns out my husbands original burger was actual rare to raw in the middle.  Sent it back. Replacement burger finally showed up after everyone else was almost finished.  Manager comp'd burger but not up to standard for any \"restaurant\".  We still have one gift card left -not sure I want to use it."}
{"text":"We go there about once a month or so and I can say that I can see what the previous reviewer was saying on some occasions, but our last 5 times there it was good. I can't really speak on all the food selections, but the black and blue burger is amazing as is the spinach artichoke dip. The chicken strips have too much breading and the buffalo chicken barely has any flavor. The salad bar is great, but being a french dressing fan, I was saddened to learn that they have discontinued French dressing, but other than that, how bad can you screw up a salad.   Overall, not a great place, but not bottom of the barrel either."}
{"text":"Wanted to update since Ruby Tuesday reps were the ones who asked me to email their corporate office with this review. I have had no response from them after 10 days. Guess it isn't hard to see why their staff doesn't care about customers. Obviously neither does their management!"}
{"text":"The worst service Ever..had to wait 15min  just for water and had to find waitress to remind her we hadn't recieved our drinks.  Salad bar was ok but then the food never came. Talked to people at the table next to us who were there before us and they hadn't recieved food yet either and were getting upset. When we complained..magically our food came out but I think it was the other tables food. We asked for it to go and after 5 min of waiting for them to put it in a box we just left without the food. They never came back with it..in the end I'm still hungry"}
{"text":"The food was the usual Ruby Tuesdays fare but the service was ssssslllloooowwww. There seemed to be an issue with one waitress in particular and it had a ripple effect to other patrons. Sad to say but good food with poor service is a bad experience. When we finally got a waitress assigned she was pleasant and efficient.  I'll still vist Ruby Tuesdays but probably not this location."}
{"text":"What the hell. Came here twice because the bf really likes the food. His food always comes out fine, but both times they have messed up my order. What the hell.   First time ordered a petite sirloin steak and I requested medium rare---steak came out completely done. This time, ordered the chicken Bella, the taste was good except it was extremely salty, to the point where I felt like I had to drink a cup of water after taking a bite of it. Didn't finish.   Thank god one of my sides was the salad bar and so I had my fill of that. The salad bar was limited but enough to do its job."}
{"text":"Our first experience at this RT was bad 3 years ago, but they mailed us a $10 off coupon so we figured we would give it another shot (free entree!). Well I won't be back a third time, even with a coupon. Our server was probably the worst I've had at any restaurant. I think the Chick-Fil-A next door has better table service, and it isn't a sit-down restaurant!   Our waiter was having a bad day, or is just not trained right, or has a hearing problem. Not only were the drinks messed up, when the entrees came, my burger was missing the bacon, and he didn't get my side dishes right. Oh and he nearly spilled a soda on my wife's purse. Luckily for us, the manager noticed his ineptitude because she started picking up his slack, getting refills, fixing my side dish order (I didn't ask for the bacon but told her the issue), and even closing out our check. And despite $10 off, and the manager not charging for one of the sodas, we managed to have a $17 pre-tax/tip bill which seemed high for the quality of the food and horrible service.  The last thing is an in-general complaint about Ruby Tuesdays. I like their salad bar, but to pay a $3 upcharge when my entree already comes with TWO sides is just too much food. I wish I could trade my side dishes for salad bar."}
{"text":"I came in with my husband for a date night on a rainy evening. Our initial plan was to visit Olive Garden next door, but I guess everyone else had the same idea because their parking lot was packed and Ruby Tuesday looked fairly empty. We came in and expected to have the option to wipe our wet shoes off on a rug after coming in from the rain. Well, much to our surprise, the floor mat was rolled up in a corner so I suppose we were expected to track in water from outside. We were greeted and seated promptly but our seating arrangements were a terrible mistake. We were placed near the bar area where employees congregate and chit chat instead of finding other duties to tend to. We were subjected to a loud conversation from one of the employees about a recent beach trip she went on with her boyfriend where she asked him if he thought she was fat. I really don't care to hear that while I'm attempting to enjoy an evening with my husband, save that for when you're hanging out with friends and not at work. We asked to move and were seated on the other side of the restaurant near the window but could still hear the employees every word and it began to grind my gears. After waiting 10 minutes to get our drink orders in a 1/4 filled restaurant, we asked to speak with a manager. Well, the manager was busy chatting it up with an old friend so I was forced to walk over and apologetically interrupt her conversation in order to express my displeasure with the lack of service. We were greeted by our waitress and she was very prompt and courteous. We were understanding of the fact that, because we switched tables, this may have created a mix-up in service which is understandable. As we ate, the loud employee was assisting a couple of the tables near us and we were again subjected to her antics. After telling guests the same story about asking her boyfriend if he thought she was fat, during this retelling of the story, I found out that it was because she loved to eat ice cream all the time. I also had to hear her tell another table of guests about a story of her mother feeding her niece salty foods so now her niece doesn't eat what the employee tries to give her. All of this pretty much paints a picture of how the restaurant is being run. I will be completely honest in saying that our food tasted great!! That is the ONLY reason that I gave them 2 stars instead of 1. I doubt my husband will be willing to come back because his patience was tested during this experience, but I'd be willing to give them one more chance, just for the food...on a day that I can tolerate the possibility of loud, annoying employees."}
{"text":"Living next door to this location certainly has its benefits and the customer service has always been pleasant. I believe the prices on some of their items is a bit steep so I took off a star for that. My guess is it's due to the location and having all of the hotels in the area. I would recommend the Buffalo chicken sandwich if you're a buffalo sauce lover."}
{"text":"Anywhere with a good drink special is OK in my book.  I like the salad bar. Always stocked. the bar has a bar special Drinks/cocktails 5 bucks A dollar more adds \"premium\" Friendly Ppl..... Sam Adams also. I enjoyed myself so much (with Sam Adams)  I asked the waitress if I cld have the glass (a special Sam Adams glass) ... she laughed and spoke to her manager.  Came back to the table with a New glass & tld me it wld be extra 5 bucks.... can't beat that.  I collect pint glasses so it was all gooooooood."}
{"text":"Meehhhh..... 20 bucks for greased up grease... hmm... AND that was part of the \"fit and trim\" options. ahem."}
{"text":"Good food. Miss the cheese biscuits though. Corporate please bring them back. Is your niche."}
{"text":"I've been a Ruby Tuesday customer for years in Buffalo, NY. I moved here s few weeks ago and decided to order my favorite dish, low country shrimp and grits. Upon arriving I had to wait for over 10 min for the waitress at the bar to come over. I finally called the restaurant from my cell, while at the bar, to get someone's attention. Upon receipt of my order I found that my portion was half what I've been served when I dine in, yet I was charged the full price of 14.99. And it was not even lukewarm. Very disappointed in my entire experience here and will be passing this on to my relatives who live here as well. Don't waste your money. If you're serving half portions then charge half price. Period. There's plenty of other restaurants in this area."}
{"text":"Trending down. Wife disappointed that all the dressings on salad bar had been cross contaminated. They need to rearrange them so people don't drip ranch into the vinaigrette, etc. No more biscuits, crappy bread on salad bar is the replacement. And my last review already complained about them taking crab cake off menu. So my complaints are aimed at corporate, our server, Danielle, was great. They need more vegan friendly menu items as well. And the onion rings taste like they're from BK next door."}
{"text":"My husband and I celebrated our anniversary here, and they really rolled out the red carpet, gave us superb service and this is now my new favorite place on a Saturday night! It was awesome, I thought it was going to be expensive, but it wasn't. I had the fried chicken sandwich, salad, and we had an appetizer, my husband had the bacon pretzel cheeseburger and salad. less than 40$, and we got a free dessert from the manager, just because it was our anniversary, and he was feeling generous. (thank you!-really nice guy too!) I gave the server a good tip because he's a frigging mind reader,he never let the glasses run empty, and treated us like gold. Thank you so much for going above and beyond, You are our new favorite restaurant, thank you so much!"}
{"text":"It's a nice restaurant. Little pricey, good fresh salad bar. Service was good."}
{"text":"I joined a friend here for dinner. Parking was easy and we were seated quickly. Our waitress was in training so we essentially had two waitresses. They were both friendly and professional. We ordered the Philly Cheese potsticker appetizer they OK. I found them a bit mushy. They could have been crispier on the outside too.   Then we ordered the summer special of the Iced Tea ribs and tenders. The Iced Tea sauce grew on me. At first it was unusual with the tea, spices and sweetness but after awhile I enjoyed it. The fries were fresh and hot as was all of my food. The ribs were a bit dry and the chicken was a touch too crispy. The salad bar is the best one around and always has been."}
{"text":"Never again will we be eating here.  Waitress brought the food out, but BOTH orders were wrong.  Hubby ordered Asiago Steak...she wrote down the Asiago Steak w/Fried Shrimp...$5 more. She said she'd adjust bill so he would only pay $1 more for the shrimp.  He doesn't eat shrimp! So he ends up paying $1 more for half a steak. I ordered the pork chop that comes with mashed potatoes and green beans.  I even confirmed that I wanted mashed potatoes and green beans.  She brought the pork chop out with mashed potatoes and FRENCH FRIES. Told her this order was wrong too. She pulled out her order pad and argued that she had written down FRENCH FRIES.  Told her again it was NOT what I ordered. She took it back and had the kitchen re-plate it with the green beans.  The pork chop by now was COLD.  I ate 2 bites and some of the green beans and mashed potatoes. Didn't bother to return the order a 2nd time  since there was no telling what the kitchen/waitress might do to my food. We ended up shelling close to $59 bucks including tip for the worst meal/service/price ever."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our dinner here. VERY FRESH salad bar, lots of toppings. Good selection of foods. Affordable and friendly service. Will return!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. We never received our order 45 minutes after placing it. We put 4 bucks on the table  for our drinks and walked out. On our way out we told the hostess we never received our food even though our server told us it was on the way. She wanted us to talk to a manager but we didn't bother. Will never go to another Ruby Tuesday again."}
{"text":"Food was surprisingly good: salmon was very well prepared, chicken was slightly dry but it was not too bad, artichoke dip was good. onion rings were crisp and fresh. Portions overall were on the smaller side.   The restaurant is desperately in need of a make over. The decor is severely dated. Above all, the floors were dirty, like they weren't cleaned in a week. Come on, all you need to do is run a vacuum at the end of the day.   Whats the worst thing you ask? Service, service, service.   SERVICE - absolutely the worst!   The hostess did not even greet us. Two? fumble, walk away. I guess we just needed to know to follow her.   Oh the waitress ... one of the worst services in my life. no smile, mumble in a low voice. no silverware, no offer of biscuits. did not come back to refill water ever. she realized there was no silverware on the table until after the food was served. So for ~30 mins we just sat there twiddling our thumbs. After oh 25 mins, she comes back and asks if she can get us some biscuits. we nod our heads and out she comes and I kid you not with one and a quarter biscuit on a plate. Yes,   ONE AND A QUARTER biscuit. Who serves like that?   we showed our coupon to her at the time of order. After a little while she talks to the table next to us, apparently she forgot to bring their soda and she goes \"I am sorry I forgot about your soda. I was caught up in all these coupons\". WTH!!!   When the food makes it appearance, she did not even care to ask \"would you like anything else?\" \"or is there anything I can do for you?\" nope ... we had to wait another 10 mins for her highness to come by so we can ask for some ketchup with the onion rings.  And you may say ... \"well, it must have been busy when you went\" Oh no no no ... we went late afternoon, 3 PM, there was 5 tables occupied at most.   Even though the food was acceptable, I will NEVER return to this place and sit through uncaring staff delivering abhorrent service."}
{"text":"Bad service and man do I hate their salad bar. It's slow when it's never even busy. Don't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Good place for a work lunch  Had lunch with a couple co-workers to discuss a coming charity campaign. Nice space and my colleagues are fans of their salad bar.  I had one of their burgers, which was oily, but till tasty.  Good overall and service was above par. Will visit, again."}
{"text":"Dirty plates at the salad bar, waitress( who was pretty good) misunderstood my order and brought out a grilled chicken sandwich, after apologizing she said she would have it rushed. Apparently that means they will just get the same piece of grilled chicken without breading then throw it back on the same soggy bun the last sandwich was on. After complaining the item was taken off(after waiting for a manager) but never once saw the manager, never came to apologize, offer other items... Instead all the employees sat with their backs to the door in a circle talking amongst themselves. What a welcoming environment. It's been several years since I've been to ruby Tuesdays and will probably be several more if I ever go again. One of the most disappointing meals I've had."}
{"text":"Walked in and waited 10 minutes. Very few people in the restaurant so I'm not sure why I was not helped. Several employees walked passed and stared at me without saying a word. If you don't want to serve customers why even stay open?"}
{"text":"Ribs on point, sweet potato fries the bomb, the salad was fresh. Loved the cilantro vinaigrette.  Chocolate cake at the end was sinfully perfect....relaxed atmosphere, def not fancy, but great food, price appropriate, and server attentive. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here every chance we get. The speediness of service is always on point and their food is simply amazing. My favorite entree has got to be their Shrimp Parmesan Pasta. It's delicious creamy sauce and juicy bite sized shrimp will have you licking the plate clean and my boyfriend really enjoys their Smoky Mountain chicken for the protein. Don't forget about their salad bar there are too many good items to pass up! We have yet to try any of their desserts because we're always too stuffed but we will definitely have to plan a trip just for that mouthwatering dessert menu"}
{"text":"I like this place. The food was decent Not bad thats for sure. Our waiter was great. They had a big salad bar, I regret not checking it out. I definitely would go back."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying Courtney the bartender saved a bad review.  See was awesome service. The salad bar was depleted when we arrived , shortly there after this kid restocked but to late. Maybe it was just bad timing for us."}
{"text":"Food was ok nothing to brag about. Server was rude and not warm and fuzzy. Sat in the booth right behind the host stand and that was an experience. Apparently the host stand is where the staff congregate and have inappropriate loud conversations mentioning bitch slapping and etc. the amount of unprofessionalism was extremely annoying. I find it disturbing that the patrons are extremely quiet mainly because they are mostly senior citizens but the staff are loud and disruptive and this was not addressed. If I wanted to feel like I was back in high school I would have gone to the cafeteria not Ruby Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Went there for they're 3 course meal deal for $13.99. Promptly seated. Server was great. Offered suggestions, but realized we knew what we wanted took order. Salad bar was fresh and lot of ingredients.  Only complaint is it's near the hostess stand and between dinners and people being seated, it gets congested. Had the ribs. They were fall of the bone tender and very good. I will definitely return here."}
{"text":"Please send me the proper link to guest service so I can tell you more about my bad experience thank you"}
{"text":"WELL.... it is just average. The food wasn't bad, but when you are paying the amount you are... it should be a little better. I got a steak and vegetable, as well as a salad. All were decent, and I enjoyed my meal, but I didn't totally love it. All around... I would give it a big fat AVERAGE"}
{"text":"Awful! Hour and forty minutes from sit down and walk out!!! We come even at off peak time, between lunch and dinner.. The food was okay, service was VERY slow and bearly considered as service! The manager did come to our table... but only to confirm our order that we put in 10 minutes earlier! We'll not be coming back ANYtime soon!"}
{"text":"Just bad.  My wife had a $5 off coupon so we wanted to try it before the coupon expired.  This was our first time to eat at a Ruby Tuesday.  We went at lunch today.  My wife ordered the skewered shrimp for $15.99.  This was a complete rip-off.  What she got was a plate with 9 shrimp and a small side of zucchini.  It was hardly any food.  She even ate half of my fries and still left the restaurant hungry.  I had one of the hamburgers with fries.  But I left hungry also because my wife ate half of my fries.  And I had to get up and walk to the bar to get a refill of my iced tea.  Not again."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here, and I wasn't impressed. It's decent food, but I don't see what the hype is.  My guy and I went in for dinner.  We were greeted when we walked in, and were seated immediately.   The ordering of the food was easy, and our waitress, Morgan, was very nice. We both ordered lemonade, which, for some reason, was carbonated and tasted horrible.  I couldn't stomach it.  We both ordered steak, one a New York, the other a petite sirloin with coconut shrimp.  The steaks were good and were cooked to our specification.  The shrimp was ok, as were the sides...zucchini, tomatoes with balsamic, and green beans.  I don't know if they left the food out before serving it, because it wasn't as hot as it should've been.  That's one reason I wasn't entirely impressed with the food.  Food doesn't taste the same when it's lukewarm and not hot off the grill.  The one good thing was the salad bar.  They have a good selection of options.  We didn't order any dessert  so I can't speak on that. Our check came out to roughly $38.00, which wasn't bad EXCEPT our 2 lemonades came out to $7.00.  I'm sorry, but there is no way a glass of lemonade should be $3.50...especially when it tasted so badly.   Overall, I can say I tried it out, but I don't see myself going back again.  For the price and quality, I'd rather stick with Applebee's or TGIF. At least the food is hot, and the lemonade tastes tart and refreshing."}
{"text":"Very decent food and really good service. I love their salad bar!   Funny story though... I was feeling adventurous so asked the server if they offered vegetarian substitutes for their burger. He answered very energetically, \"YES! Our turkey burgers are great!\" He then proceeded to point out all the calorie sensitive options on the menu. My guess is that he never saw a \"horizontally enhanced\" vegetarian such as me. :-) I just chuckled and ordered the grilled salmon w/ salad bar.  The portions were rather small but very tasty and the salad bar was great as always. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Good food. Service is bad.  Twice now we have been seated and not waited on till we ask who our waiter is. Twilight Zone booth. Also if your glass is empty and your still eating YES I want more. Seems like a dumb question to ask, my glass should not be empty where I can't finish eating because I have nothing to drink."}
{"text":"Not sure what it is specifically that I have against this place - the unjustified Rolling Stones reference perhaps? One thing I do like about Ruby however is their salad bar, simple but superbly fresh and cold.   Wiki - \"Ruby Tuesday\" is a song recorded by The Rolling Stones, released in January 1967. The song, coupled with \"Let's Spend the Night Together\", was a number-one hit in the United States."}
{"text":"For a restaurant which boosts a wonderful salad bar, it was a sad experience. Some of the lettuce was wilted and brown while other bowls were empty. The other toppings were sparse and were less than appetizing due to each of them having dropped food in them. The peas were even slimy. There were toppings dropped all over the base of the salad bar and the utensils were laying in the toppings so you had to touch the food to pick them up. The person tending the salad bar apologized for lack of toppings but then never reappeared to bring fresh items out to the bar. When we mentioned the salad bar was very disappointing, she never had anyone come over to speak to us and just brought us the bill. We will not be back!"}
{"text":"Restaurant was very clean, but oddly deserted. It was around 1:30 on a Monday afternoon. We got seated right away and got our drinks quickly. The server was wonderful and very accommodating. I wish I had gotten his name because he deserves kudos. My son got the steak and shrimp with mashed potatoes. He said everything was perfect. Exactly the way he wanted it. I tried the potatoes and they were AMAZING. I could've easily brought ten orders of those home to eat over the next few days, they were that good. I wasn't as impressed with my order though. I got the Sonora chicken pasta. The sauce was really good, and the fresh pico was nice, but the black beans were mixed with enough diced garlic to clear a room. It also tasted like the diced garlic that comes in a jar, it wasn't fresh. My chicken was cooked well, although it was really fatty and the pasta was gummy and stuck together. I also got the salad bar. I was a little disappointed with it. I think I was just expecting more from it after reading other reviews online. I live 45 minutes from this location, so I won't be back anytime soon. I am willing to give it another shot when I AM over that way, however I will not be getting salad or pasta. It's also a little pricey."}
{"text":"It's sad to say, but this is the last Ruby Tuesday in Las Vegas :( . Now, with that being said I really enjoyed my time at this restaurant today.  The server was prompt in greeting us, bringing our drinks and our food.  The restaurant was clean and had a number of guest throughout the venue. The salad contained a number of fresh items such as four types of lettuce, fresh apples, fresh mandarin oranges, ham, several cheeses a a variety of salad toppings and dressings.  The menu contained a number of seafood dishes, ribs, burgers, chicken and pasta selections.  The nice thing about their menu is that for $3.99 you can add the salad bar to your meal or you may substitute a side for the salad bar for $1.99.  Either way it's still a great deal."}
{"text":"Awesome as usual.  (Went with the full rack of original style ribs, add fried shrimp tossed in the thai phoon sauce, and broccoli and mashed potatos)"}
{"text":"A friend of mine suggested we go here for lunch . . . haven't been here since it first opened . . . and was hoping it was still as good as it was then.  WRONG  First, we got seated right away . . . and though it was not busy . . . it took another almost 10 minutes before our waiter came to take our drink order.  Iced Tea for me and a Coke for my friend . . . drinks came and there must be an ice shortage. and a fizz shortage (CO2) . . . however, there were plenty of cloudiness in my tea, and not even the lemon could help the taste.  While waiting for the entrees . . . our waiter brought us some kind of biscuit . . . a nice touch . . . had they not been burnt . . . OK . . . only three of the four were burnt.  Entrée time . . . cold Buffalo Chicken Sliders and luke warm French Fries . . . just the way I ordered it . . . NOT.  What has happened to my good old restaurant . . . the service has dropped and the food quality has all but disappeared.  Will I return . . . most likely not . . . but according to my friend . . . it is still one of his favorites . . . I guess if I come again . . . I'm going to order what he does . . ."}
{"text":"The burgers are pretty good and the salad bar was nice and fresh.  Not too pricey, but not cheap either.  Overall, this is a nice place to eat at if you're shopping at the Tempe Marketplace."}
{"text":"I gotta say I'm a fan of the chain.  The standout features in my minds eye are the salad bar, the plethora of uncommon sides (e.g. smashed cauliflower, snow peas, asparagus) and the number of non-deep-fried seafood options they offer.  Generally the service is good and so is the food.  At our visit yesterday my food, (New Orleans seafood plate with asparagus and smashed cauliflower) was all quite good.  My significant other got (oddly enough for her) Jambalaya.  She's not a big fan of sausage or chicken, so why Jambalya I don't know.  She did say she wouldn't order it again. And if how it looked has anything to do with how it tasted, the chicken looked as though it had lain butchered in the Sahara for several days prior to being plated.  Cracked from dehydration like a dried lake bed, so the fact that she ate the few shrimp on the dish and had the rest boxed up was no surprise.    Everyone knows the standard restaurant trick with rolls or biscuits; bring 3 for two people; each has one and no one will take the last so you never have to bring more. No one told that to this lady so she brought two, (and these biscuits are MINIATURE, like half-dollar sized!)  We each ate one and without asking she brought back four more!  Whoa! Nice, generous but unecessary.  The rest of the service was spotty. (Made the cardinal dining out error; when she tried to take our food order with the drink order and sent her away, after 5 or 10 minutes we sent two of our party out to search for her and they were never heard from again!)  And if a patron's glass is empty, ask he or she if more of their beverage is desired when you're at the table anyway, YAKNOWWHATIMEAN? Had two gift cards we were trying to use and asked her to use up the partially consumed one first (that means scan one to find out which one that is without ringing it up) got a jumbled convoluted mess of stuff back with the bill and was instructed to sign something whisking away all of the value of the remaining card which I didn't do)   As my Ma used to say, \"Don't throw the baby out with the bath water\" aka go to Ruby Tuesday's but perhaps select another location!"}
{"text":"Stopped here again for lunch, and one caveat I must share to the uninformed diner is, Don't come if you are pressed for time, e.g. have to get back for work! The time before last, although the waitress came and checked on us several times, the meal took extraordinarily long to arrive, so much that by the time it was due to arrive we just asked her to bag it for takeout, as the salad bar and wait combined had served to make us both disinterested in eating anything else. The waitress advised that the night shift hadn't performed the prep work they normailly do, so everything had to be made from scratch. The wait itself suggested they also had to run over to Giant Eagle and buy some items as well when our order reached the kitchen. This last time, although the wait wasn't as long, it still seemed to be inappropriate for a weekday luncheon. Do they cater to the unemployed only here? How do they expect a reasonable luncheon trade if they can't get stuff out of the kitchen in a timely fashion? Oh well, when one's dining companion is as engaging and lovely as mine the wait is relatively irrelevant! On the good side the food has never diasappointed, and there are a handfull of things that make them stand out, including a compact but very fresh and varied salad bar that is now included with the meal, (one can opt out for a second side), and a wide array of sides beyond the standard \"vegetable medley\" that EVERYONE seems to offer, frequently to the exclusion of anytthing else.  They actually offer such relatively uncommon sides as snow pea pods, and asparagus! Whoa, they actually spent more than a few seconds when ordering vegetables!"}
{"text":"It's a good place to go if you're on a diet because they practice portion control.salad bar is limited selections."}
{"text":"Ate at the bar as the place was packed. Although busy the bartender made it a blast. Had the crab cakes and for the price I haven't had better ."}
{"text":"I tried their new salad bar yesterday and it was good! The server was extremely polite, if nearly invisable...lol. The salad bar had ALMOST everything one could wish for. Will go back!"}
{"text":"Worse service ever And then she doesn't give us change and says it was only a dollar did you want it back No refill on drinks never had worse service"}
{"text":"A chain restaurant is a chain restaurant. Food was good but the server was amazing, it's the only reason I'm leaving a review. Ask for Robert N, he is over and above one of the most attentive servers we've ever had anywhere. If RT management is listening...give this guy a promotion or a raise, Seriously."}
{"text":"This Ruby Tuesday is still very solid.  Took the family to dinner Friday night and we were seated in just a couple minutes.  Our server was friendly and our drink orders were taken promptly.  The bread bites they served were tasty.  My wife and I both ordered the bourbon chicken, which was very tasty.  I ordered the salad bar and a side of mashed potatoes.  Again, the food was very solid.  I really liked filling up on the salad bar so I wasn't starving after eating only a piece of chicken and mashed potatoes for dinner.  I was quite full and quite satisfied.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"First time there.  Place was dark. Decor is old and dingy. Small tables and booths.  Ac was not on! June In las vegas? Wow.  Food was just ok. A little high on the prices.  Service was fast and good. Probably wont go back. Nothing there that screams at me to come back and spend more money."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our visit. We came in late to the restaurant and they still offered to seat us. Service was friendly and quick and the food was really good. I am often frustrated with restaurants cooking my burgers too long and happy to report our burgers were perfect. Garden bar was clean and looked (and was) very fresh. Excellent experience overall."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Ruby Tuesdays it gets worse. We used to eat there (in another state) regularly about 10 years ago. But it's gone downhill so much. Tonight I really wanted a salad bar & others in my party despise Jason's so we hiked out to Gilbert for RubyT's. $11 for soup & salad. Salad bar was messy & gross. 4 lettuce bins all mostly empty and wilted. Poor selection overall for salad bar. Fine if it's a meal add on but pizza places in town offer better salad bars & don't charge entree prices for it. They no longer offer French onion soup. Bummer, but that's a corporate decision. Didn't like the other choices so went with broccoli cheddar figuring who can scree that up? Didn't even eat it. Tasted like the frozen broccoli with cheese sauce stuff you get at the grocery.  Basically just a couple of broccoli florets swimming in milky velveeta. This was probably my last visit to RubyT's. 4 people and our tab was almost $100 with no alcohol or dessert? Nope. Just Nope."}
{"text":"I don't quite understand why this restaurant is so mismanaged. It never fails when I'm here; I always see food headed back to the kitchen because it's over cooked, servers wandering around forgetting to bring customers what they asked for, or just general disorganization. When it's continued like this for so long, and so consistently underperformed what every other chain restaurant in the area seems to do without trouble, it makes you wonder if it will ever be fixed. Long waits, asking for things twice or three times, and over/under cooked food is the norm for this place. I just don't get it."}
{"text":"FYI to the mgt, when a regional mgr contacts you, it was me who reported you. your kitchen practices are disgusting. there is a trend throughout reviews of serving COLD FOOD. our food was warm because it was DEEP FRIED IN LARD. any vegans do not trust any veggies because it is fried in animal fat, which will be evidenced by the COLD LARD residue in your mouth. this pl;ace is disgusting!!!!!  go to any of the OTHER CLOSE-BY RESTAURANTS:  Wendy's, Cafe South, Sonic Drive-In, Jack-In-The-Box, or The Bistro."}
{"text":"Ok..I think this is the one by the aloft hotel.... I usually don't eat at chains..but it was getting late and didn't want to drive.. I ate at ruby Tuesday several time s....but this one had to be the worst one in the us... the salad bar was a bit bare and un appetizing looking...thousand island dressing looked just foul..and it was room temp... ordered the ribeye (most expensive thing on the menu) it was disgusting!! I ate 1/2 of it because I was hungry...big mistake 3 am I violated the commode in the hotel room... room 301 off housekeeping reads this my apologies"}
{"text":"Came with my family for a late dinner. They had signs stating happy hour 9pm to close with 2$ domestic deafts. It was 9pm when we got there. We ordered our food and some domestic beers were ordered. I had the ribs that were good, better than I expected. Better than winking lizzard ribs. Everyone was satisfied with their meals including a broccoli chicken pasta, costal trio and big dipper sampler. Problem is that the advertisement is not upheld. We got our bill at 9:57 and when asked about the happy hour the waitress stated in ohio we can't serve discounted alcohol after 10:00pm. Considering that it was not yet 10 and the alcohol was ordered prior to the bill as well as that not being stated on the sign. That did not make any sense. The manager came over and pretty much stated that the signs don't mean what they say and didn't want to uphold the signs advertising. So pretty much they are falsely advertising. We stated our point and he adjusted the bill but just beware. I wonder how many people have been taken advantage of here."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a rainy night for dinner- it was a little crowded and I wasn't getting ANY attention in the booth so I quickly opted to move to the bar where I got excellent service and had a great view of the restaurant. Tried the new zucchini sliders and salad bar. Excellent choice.   I would steer clear of ordering the spaghetti squash as a side though. Sounded so good but it was cold, crunchy and spaghetti squash like. I guess that's how it's supposed to taste. But I was expecting Ruby Tuesdays to tasty it up with some heat, some butter, some salt, some pepper. I dunno, no one else in the restaurant seemed like they wanted some healthy cold crunchy spaghetti squash either. Call me crazy."}
{"text":"Average food...had the creole whitefish.  It was overcooked and the spaghetti squash pairing was a reach.  Service was great."}
{"text":"Walked in at 8:30pm on a Friday night, there was 3 my be 4 servers in the entire restaurant. Not even half the restaurant was full & had to wait for a table to be seated. This location is definatly under staffed! Salad bar was empty, a lady did come out to refill everything, but 3 customers had to wait for her to fill the salad bar in order to get their salads. Food looked good, & there was plenty of food. The cheese grits looked like a baked potato & the grits were hard, ate them in chunks. Cheese biscuits are always good! Went to check out & they could not run our cards to pay so we either had to run them by writing down our credit card #s or pay cash. Never do this! They will have your credit card # & can attempt to purchase items with your card! We paid cash & left. Probably will never go back to this location again! Be warned!! Credit card not being able to run sounds like a Server scam to steal your card number!! If this restaurant does not fix these problems it will be shut down soon!!"}
{"text":"If your going for the Mac n Cheese don't bother. You don't get a side like if u had a steak. Also you may as well just go to the store and get a Stouffer's Mac and Cheese. It's much better tasting. Also must have been an off-night for our server all we got was nothing but attitude"}
{"text":"Visited Ruby Tuesday for my birthday and all I really wanted was a nice burger and salad but that is not an option with Ruby Tuesday you have to take french fries and  salad bar which is a waste of food and waste of money by the time I finished our trip to the salad bar I couldn't even touch my burger so I had to take it home and eat it as leftovers and we all know what that's like it would be nice if they could offer just a single side salad for a small extra charge   After this post I was contacted by a web site from Ruby Tuesday with a concern about my service I received and asked to complete a on line review , I completed the survey and was advised at the end of the survey I was advised I would be contacted by someone from Ruby Tuesday to follow up with me on the service I received. That was almost 3 weeks ago and not a sole has bothered to contact me , I guess they are not concerned about trying to make customers happy or even show some concern about the issue . I will defiantly look at other restaurants in the area for my next dinning experience ."}
{"text":"This was my first time here but my boyfriend is an avid Ruby Tuesdayer. We had a great experience. The salad bar was very fresh. We got the rest of the food to go, but everything came out in a timely manner and it looked great. I actually did sneak out a small bite of my boyfriends mashed potatoes and they tasted delicious. Our server, Takesh B., was extremely kind and personable and also very prompt and helpful. I would definitely come back for the salad bar and service!"}
{"text":"Brandon was our waiter. He was too notch. He took care of all of our particulars and complicated orders. Food was great. Great variety for groups. With limited options near a sports arena, I would come back here every time!"}
{"text":"SERVICE - too many excuses for issues, drinks arrived during our first trip to the salad bar (order them long before we order entree)  2 of us were just eating salad bar and we had to ask twice to get rolls,  they were almost done with 1st plate before they arrived.  DRINKS - Specialty drink (summer ??)  glass couldn't have been smaller, others were fine.  ENTREE - Fish trio was good and good portion, New Orleans plate was also good but portion was rather small.     VALUE  - $90 for 2 entrees, 2 salad bars, 1 round of drinks & tip is a little pricy for me  OVERALL - 2nd visit to a Ruby Tuesday (always give a 2nd chance)  very disappointed and it will be a long while before I try it again."}
{"text":"I ordered take out while staying at an airport hotel nearby. I had the bacon cheese pretzel burger with fries. It completely hit the spot after a long day of work and driving. The fries reminded me of the county fair - which is saying a lot coming from a Midwestern girl. Friendly service, no hassle pickup with designated parking spaces for takeout. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Over the last few years, my husband and I have eaten many a good meal here. I cannot recall a single meal that we weren't happy with.   One our favorite thing to eat here is their unlimited salad bar. It's fresh, has so many choices, there is mixed salad greens, romane lettuce, ice berg and spinach. Tomatos, mushrooms, red onion, broccoli, olives, carrots, zucchini, cucumber, and on and on, everything bright, fresh and crisp! Makes a perfect salad, you get to choose and go back for more!  For entree's we had 'New Orleans seafood' with shrimp & tilapia, smoothered in parmesan cream sauce. You cand get an entree salad bar and one side, today we tried the roasted spaghetti squash.   Food good, service good we'll keep this place on our must have list!"}
{"text":"Sick of going to all the same places locally, ruby Tuesdays is a little drive for us.  After seeing their commercials we figured we would drive a little.  Me and the wife both have find memories and wanted to give it a revisit.  First note of caution was the empty parking lot.  Please note this is Saturday night at 6pm.. Prime time!!  On a positive there was no wait.  Inside the I believe somewhat newly uplifted was barely empty, a handful of occupied tables.  Still sat down to eat.. Me, the mrs and 2 children, one baby so he wasn't tortured by the food like we were.  I ordered pasta, she order a chicken sandwich and mini burgers for the 2 ur old.  Pre dinner biscuits, I guess they're called, awful tasting and super dry.. A foresight to the main dishes.  All were flavorless and after one bite we wished we stayed home and found something in the fridge.  The service wasn't poor at all but the food made the entire experience regretful and depressing!!  Sorry Ruby it's not us, it's you.. Consider us forever broken up!!"}
{"text":"I went to this location on Saturday 12-10-16.  They were busy, and it seemed as though they were also understaffed.  We were seated immediately, and waited on shortly afterwards.  Our server was not overly friendly, at all.  He basically only showed up when he knew we needed something, and he was very short and to the point.  I don't mind that though.  I think sometimes servers are a bit too intrusive.  If I'm in the area, I wouldn't be opposed to dropping by there."}
{"text":"So, we just grabbed a quick bite here after a long day of Hockey! WOW! Our food was spectacular! My burger was a Perfect medium rare, my daughter fingers were obviously hand dipped and oh that salad bar! WOW! I seriously could go and eat just that. There were hundreds of fresh choices and it was impeccably clean.  It was bit late, so our server was also the bartender. She was friendly, excited, and seemed just generally happy to be there doing her job!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour.  The staff was very accomodating in moving us to the bar for the happy hour prices and even offered to have a wrap made as there wasn't one on the menu.  My steak was well done,  very well done.  I ordered it medium well but didn't want to say anything.  The waitress noticed and sent the manager over asap who took it off my bill. Very nice staff and clean, friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"I guess for a large chain restaurant this place was serviceable. The thing that gets me is that what is supposed to separate ruby Tuesday's from Applebees is the salad bar, but when I went to go make my salad they were out of 6 things. A complete lack of paying attention to the status off the salad bar. Then I got into my peppercorn steak and it was very low quality and obviously microwaved.  Eh, completely mediocre."}
{"text":"My mom wanted to go somewhere with a nice salad bar for Mother's Day so we ventured out to Ruby Tuesday's. It was about 14 family members in attendance and the majority of us did partake of the amazing salad bar as a side for a few dollars more! I also ordered the Chicken Fresco which was simply delightful!   It was pretty crowded at this Ruby Tuesday's in observance of the holiday but that did not stop them; the kitchen staff continued to restock the salad bar with fresh clean food from the back as they asked if there was anything else we needed and didn't hesitate to get it for us!   The Kannapolis location is the best one in the area because of the care and pride they put into their food and the salad bar!   We are looking forward to our next trip to Ruby Tuesday's !"}
{"text":"I stopped in with 3 coworkers for a round of drinks and some food. The atmosphere was ok and we were seated relatively quickly in the bar area. We did, however, have to wait a little bit for our drinks to be brought to us (even though we could see them sitting on the bar). Our food only took about 10 minutes to arrive. So overall, the experience was not bad! I will be back the next time I'm in the area on business."}
{"text":"Sorry, not a good experience. Thai phoon shrimp was horrible.  Tasted like chili sauce and mayo mixed and then smothered on deep fried shrimp. Ordered Prime Cheeseburger medium rare.  Came out as a brown hockey puck.  Good side: dogs will like it. Ribs were very dry (ordered regular style) High point, daughter said Parmesan shrimp was good. Service was inattentive and perfunctory.  Cruised by every now and then but didn't notice  empty glasses.  Sort of a \"hi\", \"bye\" vibe."}
{"text":"I have always loved Ruby Tuesdays, I've been numerous times at various locations and have absolutely no complaints. I love their cheesy biscuits they give you.  I also love the Blackberry ice tea, it's so delish that I create a reason to go there just to have the tea!  Service has always been very good, friendly and efficient.  The food is always good!  No complaints on my part!"}
{"text":"They do not have any biscuits nor small loaves of bread not even dinner rolls! I had to get a slice of toasted sourdough & not even real butter! The crab cakes are NOT worth it - small, flat, tasteless & burnt! The loaded baked potato had the absolute least amount of butter, sour cream, cheers and bacon bits ever! My dining companion was smart - ordered the regular baked potato then got a large amount of cheese & bacon from the salad bar & made their own loaded potato!! They did say upfront that they probably couldn't get my rib eye as seared as I wanted but after a refire it was close. I was not impressed with the limited salad bar selections - the lettuce was limp instead of crisp & the croutons were gross tasting & spongy. The waitress advised she was new so it was easy to overlook having to request items multiple times. She was sweet & friendly & eventually got it all right."}
{"text":"It's like any other chain I've been too in the categories of Denny's, TGIF, Eppie's, Carrow's, Brookfields, Applebee's, Chilli's... You name it in this category it's all hit or miss. However my chicken sandwich turned out to be good. The free bread they tossed on the table? No thanks, but I appreciate the effort. Can't go wrong with tap beer. Ruby Tuesday's? What are you known for?"}
{"text":"We had a great lunch experience here, Cody took care of us and was friendly and patient. We had sliders and salad bar with a chocolate fall cake, great combination, nice and quiet atmosphere for a lunch rush."}
{"text":"Late night dining limited our options. Returning from the airport thought we'd stop in. Menu sounded much better than it tasted. Salad bar was not impressive and crab cakes greasy and fell apart.  Husband had shrimp and grits. Looked ok but not fresh. Daughter had a burger which was juicy...looked great but fell apart as she ate it. Had to fork and knife it. Service was decent but overall nothing spectacular especially the cob webs up above...Manager look up..need some cleaning done."}
{"text":"My husband and I were out in Avondale working and decided to stop here for lunch instead of fast food. Thought we were going to grab a quick burger or something. To my delight they had a New Orleans Seafood entree. It was tilapia and shrimp with creole sauce. Of course as you know I ask for my seafood cooked lightly (med rare) can I just say cooked to perfection! It was fabulous, I can't rave enough. Hubby had a burger and the same thing, it was perfectly cooked with great flavor. He also had the salad bar which was stocked with wonderful fresh items. You can get a coupon on the retail me not app. for buy one entree get the 2nd 50% off!"}
{"text":"Everything is top notch! The service is friendly and inviting, the food is super good. My mom is a picky eater and she loved it, she had the pretzel burger and I had the mushroom and chicken alfredo. We both shared the shrimp fondue which was so decadent! With unlimited tortilla chips. We came hungry and left super stuffed and happy Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I've came here before, and it was amazing. Yet this time, oh no. Far from amazing. Our waitress was the slowest person in the world. She looked about 24 and her name was Alyssa. She took 15 minutes to bring our drinks. She took another 20 to come take our orders. Unbelievable! She came and took our orders, we had appetizers which were chicken tenders. She never came once to fill our drinks up. She took 30 minutes to come back and we ask, \"where are the food and the appetizers?\" She said she forgot to put in the order of chicken tenders and never brought them. We got our food in 45 minutes and the store wasn't crowded at all. The tables next to us that came after us left way before us and we had a horrible waitress. One of our guests that ate with us also got the wrong order and my other guests food looked nothing like the picture and barely looked presentable. Not hoping to come again."}
{"text":"Ugh... my best friend and my husband both love this place. I don't get it! I do end up going with them somewhat often, which kills me because so many wonderful places are nearby (Wild Mango, Brown Bag Burger, Flavours of India, even Red Robin is better than this, for crying out loud...).   The salad bar is pretty good with variety if not freshness.  The food and the service have been about equally salty.   The worst thing ever is when the manager walks around to greet diners to ask how their meal is going. It's so awkward, especially because I feel compelled to lie due to peer pressure and manners.   Redeeming quality: my MIL clips coupons for us all the time, so at least it's cheap."}
{"text":"Great food and even better service. You can tell the servers have been well trained on customer service."}
{"text":"This particular location is awful. We went once several months ago and left after it took 10 minutes to even be acknowledged at our table and then another 15 with no one returning to take our food order. We finally just got up and offered to pay for our tea and then left. Awful service or should I say no service at all. Manager caught my husband on the way out the door. He was unresponsive and only made excuses.  We tried the following month and found the same exact problems. Food was ordered long after arriving through no fault of our on and then we had an endless wait with no food. Left again as this was unacceptable to wait over 35 minutes for food on another weeknight. Again no one really seemed to care about the lack of service given. Seems it is the way they operate. Won't be back to this location again. The location in Kannapolis needs to teach these people how it is done. Every time the Kannapolis location delivers awesome service in an acceptable time frame."}
{"text":"The food is really good. I can recommend like 5 dishes that anyone would like. If not, try the soup and salad bar. My favorite dish is the Chesapeake Catch, but their Ultimate Chicken Sandwich and California Club Quesadilla are amazing also. The staff works well together and the managers know the value of loyal customers. The GM was GM of the Year before and he wants to make sure every customer who leaves is happy. The kitchen staff is also great.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Went in on Mother's Day fearing a long wait, but my party of 4 was seated right away.  There seemed to be a steady stream of diners going in and out and the staff kept up pretty well.  I love this place for the simplicity of the Garden Bar, where I can eat healthy to my heart's content.  This time I opted to add the chicken tortilla soup.  The soup itself was great, but the chips I got were a little \"airy\".  The only other fault was that the shrimp skewer ordered by one in my party was kind of paltry.  Everything else we ordered was well received."}
{"text":"I ordered the Petite Sirloin and it was perfectly cooked. One of the best steaks I've had in my life. I was also pleasantly surprised by the Bacon Mac & Cheese I had as my side. Most chain restaurant mac & cheese is disappointing but this one tasted homemade!"}
{"text":"Service is slow. They have happy hour and pretty much hide the menus as if they don't want you to know about it. I live relatively close so I've been there a few times and I think over time I've gotten less and less inspired to go back. They are certainly not rude but not welcoming either. I asked the bartender for some substitution that I've pretty much always gotten and she proceeds to tell me it's not possible -_-   It's a good place to stop in for a meal before you head to the airport but between their marketing and menu...they can't compete with other similar chains such as Applebee's,Fridays or Chili's."}
{"text":"We didn't make any reservations for Valentines Day dinner, and we couldn't wait for a table at some other place so we ended up here.  We both grabbed burgers and they were on point perfect.  I would say...  Absolutely delicious!  Can we talk? \"So why a two star rating\" you ask, leaning forward.  \"If the burgers were that good?\"  \"I am glad you asked!\" I said, as I shook my head and sighed thoughtfully.  \"You got a minute?\"  You affirm with a nod and I continued  \"Well, read on friend, read on.\"  Drinks... My Arnold Palmer was so watered down and bitter tasting!  That was not alright.  But my husbands Coronas were super cold and really good.    Service... Was slow.  Terrible and very Irresponsible!  First we were served the wrong food, and later the waitress served us dessert but she didn't bother to bring spoons!  We waited seven minutes for her to come back, she never did.  We had to ask someone else for spoons so we could eat our half melted dessert.  She said she could only find \"baby spoons.\"  So we ate our dessert with the ad hoc silverware.  Check please! Finally our waitress brought us our check, complete with someone else credit card and picture in it.           John Doe is quite fortunate that we are honest people.  Poor guy never knew how dangerously close he came to becoming a victim of credit card fraud,  by simply paying for his meal!  The inexcusable fact is that HIS PHOTO WAS ON his CARD!  My husband is a different age, race and build than this credit card holder.  If the server had paid even a modicum of attention, she would have seen that she was handing this sensitive information to the wrongful party.  When she took our card we both watched  carefully to see where she went.    Anyone can have a bad night.  I get it, but by golly tonight Ruby Tuesday's got it ALL so terribly wrong."}
{"text":"I wish we had a closer one to our home. We were at Tempe Marketplace and saw it and I had to go. They  have an awesome salad bar. Not many restauraunts even have them anymore. And I must say their croutons are DA BOMB!!! Our server Lisa was also wonderful."}
{"text":"My boyfriend works in the building nearest this location and we have been to lunch here several times and been on a tight time constraint each time. The servers were always so helpful with the time constraint and friendly. They just rolled out this amazing lunch special that is $12.99 for 3 courses. Its a ridiculous value! I will for sure come back here over and over again for the friendly, prompt service and the good value."}
{"text":"First ever time trying a Ruby Tuesday and since it was in walking distance to the hotel I was staying at worked out great.  Had the baby back ribs & chicken tenders, comes with fries but opted for the onion rings.  Ribs - decent tasting Onion Rings - crispy & delicious  Chicken Tenders - not great   For dessert tried the blondie which is a brownie with nuts, comes with ice cream on the side.  Service was good but the guy had way to many tables but did a great job. Only thing we didn't get with our meal was the biscuits.  Had a pleasant dinner nonetheless."}
{"text":"Our Ruby Tuesday's in Daytona Beach side stopped the salad bar. Very disappointed as I feel that Ruby Tuesday's has a wonderful salad bar. So when I came into Phoenix and couldn't go very far because we were without a car, we went to Ruby Tuesday's for the salad bar. We were very impressed with our waiter Anthony, so personable so knowledgeable, And extremely very nice. Why can't all waiters be like that. We got our salad bar and everything was so fresh just as I expected.  We sat outside with our dog and was brought a bowl Of water for our puppy. The place was very clean all the people were very friendly and I can't say enough about the salad bar. They had a couple of different kinds of pastas, and several things that I had never seen before on the bar that we never had. Thank you Anthony for making our stay in Phoenix a little bit better."}
{"text":"Well, I went in there in a happy mood. They lady that sat us was one of the rudest people I have ever met. Our waitress was very nice, though. My burger was very dry and I ordered a salad from the salad bar but never got it. There was no salad! They never replaced any of the items when they ran low. I asked the waitress to remove the salad from the bill and then the manager came over to confirm it was removed, but he was a complete jerk about it and acted like he was doing us a favor. I'll never be going back."}
{"text":"Quite probably the best pork chop I have had ANYWHERE! The rest of the meal was just as good, the appetizers were hot and plentiful... ( I can't say enough good things about the tempura green beans). Our server, Trenton, was friendly, outgoing, and attentive... he was also very knowledgeable about the menu, helping me choose just the right entree from the menu's all-too-vast selection."}
{"text":"I can't really comprehend how a chain restaurant can serve fresh produce--but they did, and it was great. The asparagus was maybe perfect? Also our waitress, Mary, was pretty rad. The best thing that anyone on a road trip could have asked for."}
{"text":"Lunch here on Wednesday. Love the salad bar as it's always fresh. Today was no different. The staff was doing their thing, keeping everything full and clean. Been a few months since I ate at Ruby Tuesday and found some nice selections on the salad bar. 5 different types of lettuce makes for a great salad. Even chopped kale . Also 4 kinds of cheese. .  They also have free wifi. Quick friendly service too. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Ruby Tuesday's has left my home state, but I was thankful to find one on a recent trip. This was located close to my hotel and the light rail station. I was very excited to discover they have a 55 item all you can eat salad bar. It had lots of fresh veggies and made for a great meal. I was even happier to learn I could make it a combo for 3$ more and add a veggie trio (3 vegetable sides). The grilled brussel sprouts were delicious. If you opt to get a meal you can still add the salad bar for a reasonable price or exchange it for a side for even less. I do think the world needs to bring back the salad bars of the past. I definitely seek them out when I can.   Our server was great. The atmosphere was nice. My boyfriend enjoyed whatever he got. I came home and searched for the Ruby Tuesdays in my area and was saddened to find they no longer existed. This will definitely be something I seek out on future travels."}
{"text":"Five stars for service - waitress and other staff were so nice - and the drink selection is pretty good. One complaint on drinks - some of the mixed drinks are too sweet and they don't offer happy hour specials in dining room, only if you sit at the bar! Boo.   Two stars for the food. It's too darn salty. I had a chicken sandwich and fries. Sandwich was OK, fries were not that good. Nothing ever tastes that fresh and final dish is always lackluster. I tried part of the asiago steak dish. They put unmelted asiago shavings and some gross cream sauce on steak. It just wasn't right. If anything, I think it should've been on top of steak and placed in broiler for a minute or two.   They even managed to mess up dessert. We got the apple flatbread with ice cream. Flatbread was burnt at the edge. Apples tasted fake and from a can. Tiny bit of ice cream. And the caramel sauce was flung on plate in a messy, random way that didn't add to the presentation. Sighs.   Three stars for salad bar, it was fresh and offered plenty of toppings.   I like this restaurant's location because it's away from Mentor Ave and not crowded, but wish their food was better. For a chain, it's pretty standard fare."}
{"text":"Ruby Tuesday did it.  They got me to visit.  I used to not mind Ruby Tuesday.  I didn't.   It wasn't number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 etc but I wouldn't say no.  Having not been in several years,  the newest advertising and coupon got me craving chicken fingers.  Good chicken fingers.  The kind of fresh fried chicken breast which appeared in their advertisements.  We show up and have to wait for lunch.  Not the kind of wait where all the tables are full, but the wait where they make you stand in the doorway with 3 other groups while there are 30 open tables.  Apparently they didnt want to overload the kitchen.  So rather than sitting and getting a beverage, we got to stand and stare at the host.  After being sat and ordering, we waited over 30 mins for the saddest looking little chicken breast I've ever seen.   This was basically false advertising when compared to the pic on the coupon.  Total disappointment."}
{"text":"I went here with 6 others from my office (we've been here numerous times before) this time.  The service was just so-so and the food was not very appealing.  First off, I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken Quesadilla/Salad Bar lunch Combo (which I usually order).  My salad bar plate was as expected.  My absolute favorite part about going to Ruby Tuesday is getting the croutons at the salad bar. They have the best croutons I've ever had and this time was no exception. The reason I think the croutons are the best is that they are crunchy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. I should just fill up my plate with croutons and forgo the salad because nothing else is memorable.  Just unbeatable croutons!!   When they brought out our table's orders, mine was the only one messed up,  they brought me some tacos. The server appologized for making the mistake and reordered my quesedilla. She kept on saying that it'll be right out (about 3 or 4 times), but it took 10-15 minutes. When I received the quesedillas it looked like they put a lot of stuff in there to make up for messing up the order, though the presentation of the food looked like it was just quickly thrown together (then why did it take so long?). There were tons of onions and lots of salsa and not very much chicken in it.  However even picking up the limp piece of the quesadilla it was not very good--plus most of the bottom side of the quesedillas was all soggy, even with my first bite. I wasn't very happy about this, but I didn't complain about it either.  Most everything about this visit was way below par (except for the croutons). They have always been better than this on our previous visits."}
{"text":"Hesitated to stop in here because of past reviews, but very happy I decided to give this restaurant a chance. Had a great meal and super experience. Salad bar was clean and all the fixings were fresh. Had the bacon cheeseburger - it was cooked just right - with the toppings I asked for. Best thing about the visit though was our server Brooke. She was cheerful, knowledgable, attentive, and very personable. Cannot say enough good things about her.  Would come back here and dine anytime."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch on our way to Wilmington.  The host/hostess station was vacant for about five minutes.  Finally, a man came running up, and we were seated. We got the salad bar and loaded baked potatoes.  Lots of veggie options on the salad bar; however, the salad greens looked less than fresh, and the cucumbers were a bit slimy.  It is off season for many vegetables, so that could have been the reason that these ingredients were less than green.   Our potatoes arrived and were delicious!  Nothing better on a cold day than a warm baked potato. At the end of the meal, we were given garlic biscuits.  I was stuffed by then and only had a taste, but how thoughtful!  My husband happily ate both of them. What really impressed me was the staff.  They were friendly, engaging, and very customer service oriented.  Why, I bet that the host arrived up front late because he was filling another role to help another employee. I will always be a fan of Ruby Tuesday."}
{"text":"2nd time here at this location (Craig location) came to have my father daughter dinner and we had a great experience coming here !! We got the 2 for 24.99. Meal for two ... bourbon chicken and cheeseburger that also includes salad bar and a tasty dessert.. all items were just perfect not to much nore to shabby.. just want to thank the great service we had from Brenda thanx for the experience !!! It made our"}
{"text":"I really don't understand some of the poor reviews.  We live in Ca and have no Ruby Tuesday but have gone often when we travel and always enjoyed eating there.  The salad bar is excellent, the service was excellent and the interior of the restaurant is very pleasant.  There were five of us and we all enjoyed our meals.  Two ordered the two dinner special and were very happy with their meals.  How about opening one in LA?"}
{"text":"The only reason I gave this visit 2 stars instead of 1 is because I know the chain is better than this visit. Our visit to this particular location today was very disappointing. We arrived shortly before 5pm and they were fairly slow. We had a server and a training server and the service was very slow, especially towards the end of our meal. The food was blah. No real flavor to it and the burger that was ordered well done came out medium. All of this combined made for a mediocre visit until I visited the restroom. It was filthy. The walls were stained from lack of being cleaned for some time. Someone has missed the daily and weekly cleaning lists here (if they have one). I would not recommend this location at all."}
{"text":"Best restaurant I've eaten at in the area - how sad is that?  It used to be do much better in this area.  But having said that, this Ruby Tuesday was pretty good."}
{"text":"This is a chain that can be hit or miss. Unfortunately this was the miss. The experience could have been great. The service was excellent. The food was bad. I ordered a chicken salad that was pressed chicken. Ken's hamburger had an extra bonus - a bone. Needless to say his was removed from the bill. I on the other hand was starving. It was a party of 5. The other person eating a hamburger stopped when they saw Ken's bone. And the other two had no complaints.  We've never had a good experience at ruby Tuesday. I have it on good authority that there won't be there again."}
{"text":"The Ruby Relaxer is delicious! and its only 5 dollars, All The Time! I thought my burger sould be seasoned better but i loved the endless fries and the sesame wings. Those were really good!"}
{"text":"As the typical Ruby Tuesday salad bar was still pretty good everything else was quite lacking. Mind you I have not been in years. The menu definitely has changed. What used to be my favorite broccoli cheddar soup that would come in a ginormous bowl sprinkled with cheese and had a side of endless butter crackers it came out in a disappointingly small little cup and was not as special as it once was. It tastes as if it was microwaved. My steak was extremely chewy and over seasoned. Our service was also subpar for not being busy on a weeknight. The soup ended up coming out with my meal, because it was forgotten about. It might be my first and last time at this location."}
{"text":"Always have a great meal and great service and the salad bar is outstanding. As a vegan, there aren't a lot of chains I can go to where there is something on the menu I can eat. I love the Veggie Trio and chefs have often made me a special pasta dish not on the menu so I can avoid animal products. Great spaghetti squash, too!"}
{"text":"It's a normal chain restaurant.  Nothing too special.  I have always had good service here and the salad bar is always stocked and clean.  They have their own parking and my 2 boys are always taken care of.  I can't complain."}
{"text":"Had their Baby Back Ribs snd Garden (salad bar) Bar. They honestly DO have the best Salad Bar in town.   Four different lettuce blends to start, and over 20 different items including (potato salad, diced cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, black beans, hummus, cheddar pita crackers, flat breads, broccoli, and extensive selection of high quality dressings. They also had great freshly made dark bread croutons and fresh black pepper grinders. Many other selections too.  Ribs were fantastic. Fall off the bone tender with plenty of rich and flavorful thick hickory BBQ sauce.   Great service, clean and classy atmosphere. Great job overall!"}
{"text":"Below average. Service is mediocre as is the food.  We were seated at a booth with dirty seats. I asked for Pinot Grigio and was given Pinot Noir because they were out of Pinot Grigio! Ummmm OK . . . Anyway not a great experience. Will it be returning."}
{"text":"My son n law ordered the Triple bacon cheddar burger. The cook left off the bacon and the cheddar. The server was notified right away about the problem. He waited and waited, thinking the burger was being remade. Instead, the server brought a plate of half cooked bacon and 2 slices of cold cheese for my son n law to add to is already cold burger. The server had an \"Oh well\" attitude. The manager was neutral and offered nothing. It's not as though there was a staffing problem. I saw four staff members just standing around while the others were working. We would not recommend Ruby Tuesdays to anyone. I gave them a one star because the beer was good."}
{"text":"This was the best Ruby Tuesday I ever been too I will most definitely go back i had got the Parmesan Shrimp Pasta it was amazing I will get it again"}
{"text":"Ive eaten here a couple times before and sometimes it is good and other times it is so so. The last time I went was CIAA weekend, the waitress was very nice and helpful but the food was not very good. The portions were small and the food had no taste. The best part was the salad bar."}
{"text":"We had not visited a Ruby Tuesday since 2006 when I visited the (now closed) location on University and Mill in Tempe. When I walked into this one, I wondered if it was the same place.  The neighborhood watering hole feel of the old Ruby Tuesdays has been replaced by more contemporary, slightly upscale furnishings including comfy chairs and artwork. The salad bar is still there, though, and looked great.  One look at the menu and you know it has changed -- for the better. They still have the great burgers, but they have been banished to the back cover of the menu. The emphasis is now on healthier but substantial fare like small steaks, seafood, and chicken.  I had the dockside grill trio, including a small skewer of grilled shrimp, salmon, and spicy tilapia with mango salsa. This entree comes with rice and one side. I was disappointed to hear they didn't have the spaghetti squash, but opted for the mashed cauliflower. Good stuff.  My wife had the petite sirloin and fried shrimp. The shrimp were coated in a cornmeal-type batter with some Cajun spice. Great job done preparing it.  The service was friendly and efficient. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The BF and I went out tonight wanting a burger. We kind of wanted to sit somewhere, so the fast food places were eliminated. We decided to drive around Tempe Marketplace and see if there was somewhere to get a burger (man....west Mesa is devoid of good burgers....and good food). It was between here and Red Robin...we made the wrong decision. The place is kind of dark, like they are trying to be a fancy steakhouse when it is really a TGI Fridays or something like that. The BF got a cheeseburger and said it was meh. I got the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was pretty lackluster. Not at all spicy. Not very flavorful.... just meh. It came with two sides and I got the snap peas and the mashed potato. The peas did not have snap, as they were cooked to death. The potatoes were ok, but not good enough to eat them all. The dinner wasn't terribly expensive...but not cheap. I wouldn't be back."}
{"text":"So we went here for a brunch this morning for my brother's wedding. We had a large party (30 people ish) and they were very accommodating for us. We had a big section of the restaurant just for us and they had a menu for large parties that we could order from. The restaurant also looked really nice, they revamped these restaurants to look more like steakhouses so they look a lot nicer than they used to. The waiters were all really nice and the head cook was also nice, came out to make sure everything was ok. The food, however, was not so awesome. I got steak and eggs and ordered my steak medium well. This thing was way well done, like dark brown throughout. It tasted mediocre. Another party member requested eggs sunny side up, but apparently they only use egg beaters, not real eggs so they couldn't do that. I guess I don't blame them, they don't have brunch everyday, but it's still a bit strange. Anyway, I probably wouldn't go there to eat again, but I did appreciate the great service. I would recommend this place for big parties for brunch because even though the food isn't awesome, it is affordable, they work with you, it's close to the airport, and the service was good."}
{"text":"Ok, get out the pitchforks and torches - I like a chain restaurant. I have stopped by for a quick dinner a few times in the past months. Swallowing my pride, I prepared to swallow some overly seasoned factory assembled chain garbage.   And I had nothing to fear. The new menu has a great selection of fish, seafood, steak, burgers and chicken. Not to mention a large well stocked salad bar. And even better, the menu includes many low cal selections. Now I'm not going to go on about the particular menu items as it seems they are updated often and by season.  But you generally know what is on a chain menu.  The difference here is that he selections actually taste good, are generally well seasoned, and served at the correct temp and level of doneness.   The service has been great each time I went, big +.   So my palate hasn't completely died, I get that I'm not getting fresh locally sourced everything. But this is about as good as it gets for chain food for me lately.  Call me a reluctant fan."}
{"text":"When my boyfriend and I try to stick to a low carb diet, Ruby Tuesday's becomes are lazy dinner night go to. Their salad bar is the perfect option for the diet restrictions. However, you have to be careful, as this place can get pretty expensive for a chain restaurant. Keep an eye on their coupons with the Ruby Rewards, or whatever it's called, they make this place worth while."}
{"text":"I am traveling and over at the crown plaza hotel..  after reading a yelp review that slammed the dinning options so I opted for Ruby...   Not a bad choice.  Their salad bad is fresh and stocked. . I had the hickory salmon and it was very good...   They have about 6 or 7 beers on tap and have a happy hour on generic beers and drinks... they had Sam Adams winter lager which was a treat.   Sat and ate at the bar and the bar keep was very nice and talked to you, didn't ignore you... Nancy was the gal and she was pleasant and friendly.  It IS upgraded bar fare sorta like chili's.  Their salad bar is better though.  All in all, I think I made a good choice. Give them a try and pay normal prices for a beer not hotel prices."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places just for salad bar omg and it's even better than before delicious and fresh.  However the server was slow and they weren't even busy. The smell in the restaurant was a little disturbing considering I overheard a conversation between an employee and another guest that it was unknown source amidst several failed attempts to find it."}
{"text":"Again, Ruby Tuesday is one of our regulars about once a month.  Join the email club for 50% off or a bogo coupon in your email box every week.  We love the salad bar here.  It is always so fresh and YUMMY. Salad bar comes with most but not all entrees.  We like the mini burger combo that comes with the salad bar for like $8.99. They change the menu here a lot but we always find something new and great tasting on the menu.  Lots of steaks, ribs, shrimp and The burgers are great. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The food gets 5 stars, its our server who led to me giving you 3 stars, for starters she didnt seem very polite but thats not what bothered me, what really bothered me is how annoyed she looked when i asked her for stuff. I ordered a rasberry iced tea but didnt really like it so instead i asked if I could get strawberry lemonade. She looked at me & said \"ill see what I can do\" really? I thought that was so rude I even asked if it was an extra charge that I'd gladly pay it. She ended up giving me the lemonade so idk why she made it a big deal to begin with. Im also a server at a cafe & I'd never treat any of my costumers like that specially over a drink. Thats ridiculous. I still left a good a tip for the other people who helped us. I really hope you have a talk with the servers."}
{"text":"This location was the first time I went to Ruby's. I instantly fell in love with the shrimp fondue and so I get it whenever I go to Ruby which isn't that often but  still. This was when I realized that I'm not a big fan of lobster so I try not to get anything with lobsters anymore. My boyfriend liked the pretzel burger. The place and service is pretty good"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst dining experience. Food came out wrong twice and, in the end, just got taken off the bill without eating. Manager couldn't have cared less and was uninvolved. Horrible!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken fresco. When it came I kinda had to laugh. It was so small the tomatoes on top were covering and over hanging on the chicken. I really should of taken a picture. When it came down to pay the bill the waitress over charged us $12 dollars. And was really sketchy when we asked to see an itemized list of what we got. Then she told us she charged us for extra drinks  and said she gave us our 5$ off coupon, which she didn't and swore she did bout couldn't prove it. After the whole debacle my wife talked to the manager who obviously could care less and did absolutely nothing. I will not go back which is unfortunate. It seemed like the waitress was being dishonest and was looking for a bigger tip"}
{"text":"Extremely Poor service, we arrived at 745pm, the resturant was almost empty we waited over 1hour 30 minutes for our food. There was no dinnerware on the table, no plates on the salad bar. The staff was completely rude, the waiter just slide the dressing over to one of my guest. The staff was completely unprofessional. The worst service I have every had, my shrimp was under cook. This is CIAA weekend!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Bartender was so helpful and my friend felt so special for her birthday! The manager was also wonderful!! First timer and this is one of my best restaurant experiences in a while! Clean facility and great prices. Will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"Consistently follows the Ruby Tuesday's formula, it is exactly the same as every other one I have ever been to, right down to the semi-crunchy pumpernickel croutons on the salad bar.  Massive selection of their burgers on the high-gloss menus, all come with their overly salted \"bottomless fries.\" They have a wide selection of other items, including salads and entrees, but the emphasis here is on the burgers.  I really like Ruby's for the salad bar, which I think hasn't changed in ten years. It's the same stuff at every restaurant, not that it isn't a fresh alternative to the usual cole slaw side items at other places.  Drinks are refillable and I really liked my Ruby's Tea. The wait staff always seems so dang young, though that could just be me. ;-)  It's casual dining with a very full selection at the bar. Would I come here again? Sure. Consistency is nice sometimes. I can't find a thing wrong to say about the place, but it's just not a \"five stars\" restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was normal for a chain restaurant but I give this 5 stars due to the staff. The maître d was an amazing guy who was very welcoming, the bartender was funny (think his name was Eddy?) and our waiter comped a dessert because of some bad grapes on my daughters plate. Definitely worth coming back because of them!"}
{"text":"Unfortunate experience with this location last weekend.  We ordered pick-up.  Didn't realize till we got home that two side items were missing. Also, the dipping sauces for both appetizers we're missing.  Who wants to return to the restaurant to retrieve items and then come back home to cold dinner? Not me.   The steak was over-seasoned.  The skewered jumbo shrimp was way too salty.  It hardly tasted like shrimp. The green beans were good.  Put out fifty bucks, when we would have enjoyed a mediocre, but reliable McDonalds meal for ten dollars.   I used to really enjoy Ruby Tuesdays, especially their appetizers. I don't expect I will eat there again."}
{"text":"Average food, service not bad. Would return. The new white chocolate cherry cheesecake was great!"}
{"text":"I came in with my family for Mother's day dinner and I have no intention on coming back again.  The server we were given at first did not listen well at all.  My mother needed information about the nutritional facts of the food.  She is on a low potassium diet and he offered her a gluten free menu.  We explained that menu wouldn't help and he told us that he would send a manager over to give us the information.  A manager didn't come to the table.  He kept forgetting things that he said would be right back.  My final straw with him was when he dropped off the appetizers, but didn't bring any plates.  I went for the manager to let them know I needed a different server. At first I was informed that they each had their section and then I was told they would see what they could do.  We finally got a new server.  Unfortunately, the person that took our order seemed to have things messed up.  I had to send my meal back to correct it.  My mother's meal had to be sent as well because they over cooked her steak.  Don't give a large party to someone that can't handle it.  Our second server did her best to make up for the issues, but there was no redeeming the experience.  At the end, the only thing removed from the check was what we had a coupon for.  Another member in our party told the manager that because of the horrible experience something should have been done.  After that, the only thing removed was the appetizer that had to be sent back because it was freezing by the time we got the plates.  We ended up with 3 mothers in the party that did not enjoy their mother's day dinner, myself included."}
{"text":"Clean, convenient, fast, decent food, big selection. Burgers are generally undercooked and leave your food swimming in a pool of juice, but they are tasty. The Salad Bar has a ton of fresh vegetables, but not much else (meat, bread).  If you do go, try and get Ronique as your waitress. This cute high school chick was the best part of our meal - always smiling like she was on America's Next Top Model, and everything was (both) thumbs up or \"great, great.\" This may be annoying for anyone else to do, but she pulled it off. Big tip.  Minus one star for nothing memorable."}
{"text":"It reminded me of an expensive Dennys.  In no hurry to go back.   My hamburger  was supposed to be medium came rare and since the waitress was originally pleasant and quickly changed the 98 dollars we spent I would have been happy to have at least service w a smile.   The manager kept staring but not one word was said to us."}
{"text":"First time ever in a Ruby Tuesday, where we live there isn't around. For 12.99 I got Salad, Petite sirloin, 2 sides, and dessert, GREAT DEAL. The steak was cooked perfectly. I didn't give them 5 stars since my daughters pizza was burn and because of that she was very unhappy."}
{"text":"There for dinner tonight. I only had the salad bar, and to be honest that little sliver of salad bar is not worth $9. It's better to get it with a meal. At least it's fresh, and has fairly good variety. My sister had the salmon florentine and my aunt had steak- mooing rare. They both said they were very good. We'll definitely be back. I wouldn't mind trying a few of their cocktails too!"}
{"text":"Wow.. what can I say. I just get it why Charlotte can't build a great salad bar... So I have a coupon from the Sunday paper and decided try their salmon...   Got there and not very impressed - some friends of the bartender were in there and they were extremely loud and some of the conversation should have been saved for else where - ruined my stay.   So I order the entree of grilled salmon with two sides.. dead broccoli (really, how hard is it to steam these? and not kill them and drain them of all the vitamins) and the salad bar.   What a screw up that was. The salmon was old and thank ga I ordered the glaze on the side - GROSS. I could barely eat the salmon, tasted old and frozen. And the salad bar.. what a joke, at least they had spinach.   I ordered a glass of chardonnay and she asked me what size? What, like small, med, and large? Basically, yes. Ah.. nice - but even with these options, their selection of wines were way over priced, especially when you know you can get a bottle for $8.99 at Trader Joes - Where a medium glass was the same cost.   What really freaked me out here... the bartender/server was really nice and tried... but since her friends were there, she forgot about my wine or to let me know I could go to the salad bar at any time. When her friends left, she remember me. She brought over a glass and a bottle of red.. What? I ordered Chardonnay. Then she apologized, went back to the bar and POURED the red taste she was going to give me BACK into the bottle. OMG I just about barfed. Luckily she had to open a new bottle of the Chard.   Will I go back - nope. Another disappointment."}
{"text":"So I was out in the Steele Creek area today... don't ask. I'm glad I was able to step in to Ruby Tuesday for three reasons:  1.) Salad Bar -- I miss REAL salad bars, back in San Diego, well to be correct anywhere in California, they have fine establishments like Souplantation, Fresh Choice and Sweet Tomatoes... these are FULL blown salad bars with everything under the sun as vegetables, pasta (both hot and cold), breads/muffins and tons-o-soup. I truly appreciated Ruby's salad bar today. Since moving here, I've be completely overwhelmed by the fried this, the fried that and it's all served with RANCH on top. So two stars for the salad bar for sure-however they should check the lettuce once in awhile to change it out  2) WiFi-- Damn I was so surprised! I sat in the bar as the restaurant was slow and I saw that most of the customers where seated in the bar area and then I saw everyone with their laptops out! WTF are you kidding me! I was do darn happy. I love this idea, but unfortunately while seated I had a flashback of doing work in an airport restaurant because my effing flight was delayed because they could find the pilot -- and YES this happened!!!! Twice at that.   3) Adult like atmosphere--I love'd the fact I didn't have to listen to people chatting on their iPhones/Androids (LOUDLY) about why or why not their boyfriends suck, what horrible customer service they received at Nordstoms, or whether or not they should go to the doctor since it hurts when they piss...  I truly loved CNN on the 8 tvs... I loved having news in the background, somewhat cool bar music, and great wait staff... truly they were all great!   So all in all I will give this RT 4 stars... I'm going to check others nearby as I would love to have a cocky while I surf.   For now, this Cali girls gives Four stars to this salad bar... but while always be in search for the next big one to ride... Salad bar that is."}
{"text":"I can see how some folks like this place but our family just did not like the experience, the decor or the food."}
{"text":"I came by myself which I've found is the same as being invisible but as I sat looking at the menu I heard the table next to me complaining about how long they had been there & still hadn't gotten their food. Their food did finally come. I waited almost 15 minutes and the waitress never came to even ask a drink order so I left. Shame on you Ruby Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Well, service is mediocre and food was cold. Won't be back here anytime soon.  Visiting a known chain restaurant like Ruby Tuesday's, you know what your going to get and you know the standard. Having worked in a similar chain I know how these restaurants are ran. When service is not so great and food is not very good then I blame management.  Ques o for an appetizer was not bad as long as you don't mind old, stale, and chewy chips. That is just gross. The salad bar is always good at Ruby's right? Well yes, as long as the employee is continuously filling the empties. Only here they were filling up half empties and leaving items such as cheese gone. Salmon and mash potatoes are all me! Only the mash was cold. Layer of dust on the lampshades just grossed me out.  I usually like a Ruby Tuesday's meal, so I was very disaponted at this location. I will not be back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great service. I had the turkey burger and it was perfectly prepared but the French fries were empty and had no potatoes in them. Very displeased that I didn't get my fair share of potatoes. The fries robbed me of potatoes"}
{"text":"really good pork ribs,AMF AN Margaritas on point,I don't know about there shrimp or baked potato but Frenchfries delicious...."}
{"text":"Party of eight, with children. Got seated right away. Good service. Getting the food took some time. When it was ready three servers brought it which was excellent. Drinks were kept filled. When a hair was found the server immediately apologized, and went to get a new meal. Management came out and told us the meal would be taken off the tab. Very professional. Good food."}
{"text":"Their bison burger LITERALLY took my breath away.. I seriously had respiratory problems after one bite, it was so weird. And I didn't mention it to anyone else at my table until I saw that they were grimacing uncomfortably, then I asked \"am I the only one having a hard time breathing?\" They all said they were having the same problem! Weird! I wonder if it is a common thing when you eat bison?  Anyways.. nice restaurant in the outskirts of Vegas. Had to try it while I was there because there are none in the Bay Area (only in the greater Northern CA area.. boo). Ordered several appetizers, burgers and drinks.  -spinach artichoke dip: I like BJ's better - mozarella and tomato salad: can't really mess that up - bison burger: a nice lean meat sandwiched between thick buttered bread and accompanied by fresh veggies. a must try - white cheddar mashed potatoes: i LOVE white cheddar so this was a nice surprise - bacon & cheese fries: the star of the show! loved it - zero proof strawberry lemonade: carbonated but good. could have done without the carbonation  The other nearest location to me is Folsom, CA. Luckily I have family there so I can make it another excuse to visit them and eat :)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere in the bar area. Stopped for drinks and snacks and found the drinks excellent and service especially great!! I am sorry to have gone to this Ruby Tuesday and now I know what Folsom, CA lost when the one there closed down!! The barmaid [not to be sexist] was helpful, friendly and mixed a mean cocktail!!!!"}
{"text":"Wife and I went there for dinner yesterday.  I started off with the salad bar which was really fresh and was a great choice considering what I ordered next....Ribs and Southerns Style Fired Chicken.  The meat fell off the bone on the ribs and chicken tenders were very delicious.  I got a couple of glasses of their IPA beer and that finished it off nicely.   Obviously we have been to RT many times before but I felt like this time they deserved a good review. The service was very good and it was clean and well kept.  I don't usually go to chain restaurants but I guess I can fit RT into my list as a decent one.  I don't know it could be a good luck we had that day to get good service and good food so we were happy customers.   I have been gone to many chain restaurants, but either it was a hit and miss or they sucked from the beginning. RT has been consistently getting better in the past couple of years and recent several visits. Good for them."}
{"text":"I know, I know, for someone who hates corporate, I find myself at a well known restaurant kind of a lot. My sister said they have a great salad bar and I was already at Tempe Marketplace so I met her there. We just had 2 salad bars and went for it. There were 3 types of lettuce, head lettice, mixed greens and spinach and then it all fell apart. There were ingredients from the 80s, ham chunks, broccoli, mushrooms, carrots that were white from exposure to air, and egg. There was a pasta salad and a waldorf salad and sunflower seeds. Pretty much it. They should seriously have the server or the hostess who had nothing better to do with no customers, stir that shit once in awhile. The potato salad had a crust on it like it'd been there all day and nobody ate one single bite. Disgusting. My sister asked for bread or rolls of some sort and Taylor, our server, brought out hockey pucks of biscuits. I mean, she was extremely nice and totally efficient for a server that really didnt have to do much but I think I would've asked the cook for new biscuits for my one and only table. I will never return to a ruby tuesday.....ever."}
{"text":"Wonderful, considerate staff, good food following the standard menu for the chain. Full bar. You wot be disappointed ."}
{"text":"Apparently I'm in the minority here, but this place is pretty good.  Great salad bar with many items.   Some lower cost options to pair with the salad bar and you end up with a $13-15 dinner with all -you-can eat salad bar.   I end up taking my entree home most of the time.   Clean and friendly."}
{"text":"Things did not go as well on another visit with a different couple.  First of all, one of my favorites, the Asian Dumplings, having been cut from the menu, are no more.  And Mango for Mango Iced Tea has been replaced by a mango-flavored syrup which was not well received by two of my fellow diners.  A new app, Thai Phoon Shrimp is billed as tender and crispy shrimp tossed in a Sweet & Spicy Chile Sauce, but I and a table mate found the shrimp to be too heavily breaded, and the sauce too cloyingly sweet.  My Jambalaya Pasta, consisting of chicken, shrimp, and slices of Andouille Sausage mixed in a creamy sauce with linguine was hot and spicy but not that flavorful, and the sausage tasted like thin, spicy pieces of fried hot dog.  As usual, the make your own salad from the Salad Bar, this time with French Dressing, was excellent, although few spring greens were on hand to go with Iceberg Lettuce and spinach leaves.  Diane very much liked her Coastal Trio of sweet lobster, tilapia, and skewered shrimp.  Service was good, and booth seating comfortable."}
{"text":"I give their food of five out of five but their drinks were a two out of five - food outweighs drinks so I give them four stars. The service was amazing so I cannot complain but the drinks tasted nothing like what they were supposed to be. We ordered a salad bar (free birthday meal) and burger (free birthday meal) along with two peach Sangria's. Salad bar was amazingly fresh and had quite a few options for a basic salad. The burger was cooked perfect and came with any side so we got a caesar salad that was just as fresh and delicious as the salad bar. Now down to the drinks, we ordered peach sangria and they tasted like beer! That is the only way I can describe the taste I could not taste any fruit it  taste like a Bud Light with a splash of grenadine. To make matters worse once we told the waiter about it he walked away as if he spoke with someone but came back rather quickly. When he arrived back at the table he announced to us that he could not take the drinks back because his manager would not let him, my best friend asked if there were any other way that we can be compensated or maybe change the drinks and he advised her no. At the time we should have called corporate but we didn't know. I will not blame all Ruby Tuesdays but I will definitely say that the bar customer service needs development at this location."}
{"text":"Good salad bar.  Good, consistent food.  Sign up for their email newsletter, you will get some good coupons.  Without coupon or some special I probably would not go."}
{"text":"Love a good salad . . . found it here both times.  After an hour-long grueling workout of refrigerator examining and measuring at Sears outlet, suddenly craved a cool, crisp salad.  Remembered having a great one just around the corner at Ruby Tuesday, so that's where we headed.  Have been here only twice---a year ago, and again yesterday.  Okay, I get it.  Lots of diners don't like salad bars for the obvious reasons.  However, there seems to be enough glass (or plexi-glass) separating eaters from edibles, so probably pretty safe.  Just keep this in mind:  Do any of us really know what may go on behind the swinging kitchen doors of any restaurant when we happen to be there?  No---none of us do.  Probably worse than anything we can imagine happening along a salad bar line in full view of fellow diners.   Staff  * * * * * Server Ryan and the manager, both great---friendly, helpful, attentive  Salad Bar  * * * * *  All fresh:  5 star combination of a garden mix of lettuces, tomatoes, cucumbers, red onions, adamame, mushrooms, sunflower seeds, and an excellent blue cheese dressing---and afterwards, a small sampling of their Waldorf-style salad.   (However, didn't care for their pasta/vegetable and potato salads.)   Had many other items and dressings to choose from.  Mini Burgers  * * *   Actually, not that small.  Comes with two, but after eating my salad, could eat only half of one.  Pretty good flavor.   Think it was just 8.99 with salad bar.   Good value.  Dry-Rubbed Baby Back Ribs  * * * *  Very good, especially for having no sauce.  (Available, but tried it without.)  Macaroni and Cheese  * * *   Flavorful and creamy.  My personal preference, however, would have more cream and firmer pasta.  Fries and Onion Rings  * Neither are good and neither are recommended.  Either very poorly prepared or---more than likely---pre-made, frozen, and baked to order.   Nothing like deep frying fresh, which neither were.  Especially awful were the onion rings.  The coating had a very unpleasant, earthy-like flavor, and an unappetizing panko-like crumb.   The manager quickly offered to prepare another order.  It was the same.  Onion rings should never be \"breaded\".  The best and only preparation is a good batter, then deep-fried---never baked---resulting in a slick and smooth exterior, with NO crumb texture.    What I'd order on a return visit?  Salad Bar and Dry-Rubbed Baby Backs"}
{"text":"How do they advertise chicken and ribs and they are out of Ribs unacceptable when in and out been there before seems like bad luck with this place. SMH"}
{"text":"Since we don't have Ruby Tuesday restaurants in So Cal--at least, not at the time this review is being written--going to a RT in Vegas was a MUST for me when the BF and I were in \"Sin City\" for a conference last spring. The nearest RT wasn't too far from where we were, and we ended up meeting two of our friends there for dinner on a Wednesday evening.   The restaurant was pretty busy when we arrived for dinner around 6 p.m., but the eatery itself wasn't hard to find (plenty of parking) and our party of four was seated right away. This restaurant location was right on par with all of the other RTs I have been to -- clean and the salad bar was sufficiently stocked. I was more than happy to enjoy those fresh croutons during this particular visit as well! Those are seriously my favorite croutons ever.   I made up for the fact that we don't have any Ruby Tuesdays in So Cal by overstuffing myself with that salad bar during the meal ... so much so that I didn't even have room for the limited-time peanut butter dessert they were featuring at the time! Though I was disappointed about the dessert, dinner was very, very good and satisfied my craving for those croutons. I think I made 2-3 trips to the salad bar just for them.   Here's what I got during this trip, as well as menu items I would recommend:  \"Create Your Own Garden Bar\": I usually get the \"Garden Bar\" with my meal, and sometimes it's my only entrée. I love the assortment of toppings included in the salad bar and often make 2+ trips to get more. I usually get spinach salad, cheddar cheese, bacon bits, blue cheese crumbles (the chunks of blue cheese at this location are huge!), grapes, pasta salad (I love the pasta salad that's studded with ham and peas), cottage cheese, blue cheese dressing and, last but not least, the famous, crispy, spongy and salty brown croutons that I absolutely CRAVE. Those croutons alone make a trip to the Garden Bar worth it. This location did a GREAT job keeping everything in the Garden Bar section well stocked, and I really enjoyed the fresh basket of those croutons.   \"Southern Style Chicken Tender Dinner\": If I'm going to RT for dinner, I'd want to get this entrée one day. It features all white-meat chicken, dipped in the eatery's signature batter and fried to a crisp golden brown. The chicken tenders are served with fries and a side of honey mustard. I like the chicken tenders that are featured in the appetizer dish, so I know I would be more than happy with the chicken tender dinner. Definitely a good choice if you're in the mood for deep-fried, savory goodness for your next meal.  \"Parmesan Chicken Pasta\": I don't usually order pasta from RT, but this entrée sounds delicious. It features Parmesan-crusted chicken breast over penne pasta tossed in Parmesan cream sauce, then finished with tomato-basil sauce and Swiss. I would ask for my pasta to be light on the tomato sauce, since I prefer cream sauce over anything tomatoey. But I'm sure the Parm-crusted chicken breast gives the entrée some extra cheesy flavor and the breaded crust provides welcomed texture and crunch. If any of these entrees come with a side, I would go for the onion rings or French fries ... and if I was really craving it, I would pay extra for the premium sides of baked mac 'n cheese or the loaded cheese grits. I don't remember the cheese grits being on the menu before, and I've tasted really good cheesy grits before, so I'm interested to see how this RT version compares.  \"Buffalo Chicken Burger\": This is a step up from the Buffalo chicken sliders that I usually get. This burger features southern-style chicken breast tossed in spicy Buffalo sauce and is topped with melted Swiss cheese. All burgers come with tomatoes, pickles and mayo--and are served with fries--but if I got this burger, I would get it sans pickles and tomatoes. I already know I love that buffalo chicken, so if I'm super hungry and want more than those sliders, I would go for this bigger entrée.  \"Bacon Cheese Pretzel Burger\": The pretzel burgers were a more recent addition to the RT menu, and I do love a good toasted and salted pretzel bun. This burger features applewood smoked bacon, melted cheddar cheese and bacon mustard mayonnaise. Great combo for a bacon lover like myself.  \"Double Chocolate Cake\": I've never ordered dessert from RT before, but this sweet treat would be the first one I'd try. It features a chocolate cake with a molten chocolate center and is served with a scoop of creamy vanilla ice cream and strawberry sauce. I love the molten chocolate cake at Chili's so I'm sure I would like this version as well. I would ask for the strawberry sauce on the side, though -- don't want nothin' marring my perfect chocolate dessert!"}
{"text":"If you have a steak combo on your menu that costs $19, you should be able to cook the steak properly.  I ordered the Petite Sirloin and Lobster Mac & Cheese for $19.  The mac & cheese was OK but looked reheated.  I ordered the sirloin medium and it came back completely well done.  No pink whatsoever.  I sent it back, waited 15 minutes and got a second sirloin.  This was on the border between medium well & well done with just a bit of pink.  I didn't bother to send it back since I had my 5 year old with me (he had to wait 5-10 minutes to get ketchup for his chicken strips, by the way).  The salad bar is very good, everything else was mediocre or poor.  No excuse for messing up a steak twice."}
{"text":"Great service. Excellent prices with unbelievable portion sizes. The salad bar is fantastic."}
{"text":"I really love the salad bar, they keep it pretty well stocked, but don't order anything that requires them to cook vegetables, as they don't seem to know how to get that right. I had to send back multiple times my pasta primavera, and they still couldn't get it right. The vegetables were hot, but essentially still raw. They don't seem to understand the difference between cooked vegetables and hot vegetables."}
{"text":"Nothing was spectacularly amazing. Just...good, not bad, just good. Service was ok. Fairly speedy. But not super friendly, just again kind of...average. One thing that irritated me was that the gluten free menu was only on their website. I'm glad they have a gluten free menu at all! But it kind of defeats the purpose if it's on a website that doesn't really work all the time. I struggled getting it to load at all on my phone.  I ordered the gf pasta and it was good! Again, nothing spectacular. But good."}
{"text":"First off, the woman who rated it a one star because she didn't get bread with her pasta made me laugh. If it's not on the menu, it doesn't come. Okay, now that my rant is over, Ruby Tuesdays is great. It sometimes takes a bit to order and get your food, but there are TVs and enough of an atmosphere that it is not that big of a deal. The salad bar I would suggest to anyone. Most of the time everything is super fresh, and they have tons of toppings to choose from. The croutons are to die for though. I would die happily if I gorged myself on their croutons. Also the menu is decent. Triple prime burger is a unique take on a burger blending three types of steak to create the ultimate steak burger. For the high end diners, they also offer steaks, ribs, and great chicken dishes. This place won't appeal to people expecting items to be given to them that aren't listed on the menu. But it will apppeal to people who like what the menu offers."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch the other day.  Really just went for the salad bar...  I always associate them with a decent salad bar with lots of options for greenery (base), toppings (veggies), extras (tomatoes, hb eggs, pasta salad, cheese, etc), and dressings.  I ordered the lunch soup and salad deal that they offer and had the White Bean Chicken Chili soup which was excellent and then two helpings of the salad bar piled high on my plate.  I need to watch it with the cheese and croûton (which are excellent and unique - probably not the greatest for you either since they taste good).  Wait staff was nice enough... the place didn't get too too busy.  I guess I usually associate RT with a large dinner and people don't really look for something that heavy for lunch."}
{"text":"Stuck us old fat people in a corner and tried to forget about us! No biscuits with the salad bar, but the menu states that it comes with! Waitress waited on the four young guys that came in behind us. Only ever saw our waitress twice. Never asked if we wanted a refill either! Hubby thought things were fine, not me. Don't think you should gave to wait 10 just to see a waitress and get your order in!"}
{"text":"The mice have senselessly invaded my house and it's a bloodbath in here with the cats going crazy with widescale killing and not eating what they kill and it is so gruesome and god-awful that I had to go out to dinner.  My first choice was going to be a theme dinner at one of those filthy Broadview Heights restaurants out next to the Norton Landfill. I remember seeing the CMHA garbage trucks dumping in that place and when they popped open the back end of the truck, the rats would come out big and mean and looking for a fight. I wish my mice had some fight in them like those teethy fuckers did..  Alas, city officials have bulldozed those awful infested dining establishments to make room for a Giant Eagle. The rats are the only ones still eating out on that side of town. I had to go to Seven Hills and find me a Ruby Tuesday. I figured it'd be dirty in there too. I was not disappointed.  The frozen fries must have screamed something fierce when they hit the scalding black oil because damned if they're not both overdone and underdone at the same time. Thaw those bad boys out first and they'll fry up alright. Making fries ain't hard to do. Get it together.  The immigrant running the beef patty machine out in Colorado was hitting his ISO 9001 specs on the dime when he made my burger because it was exactly round and precisely even when it hit the grill. I'm sure it recoiled in the heat of the cooktop and as the line cook squeezed every drop of juice out of it, it shrank and tightened as if to scorn me for eating it.  The service was fine and I liked my waitress. The burger was a mess and I was ashamed to be eating it. If you've got some scratch get one of those silly iced tea drinks with booze in it. Just drink it fast or the ice will melt.  This was quite an ugly and offensive way to spend an evening until I realized how it all made sense. The people around me were having fun and enjoying their food. Did they care that it all came in from a New Jersey wholesaler? No. They were laughing and it was a good time and I was the dick because I went to Ruby Tuesday in Seven Hills looking for a Moxie burger and some Lola fries.  I should have had the beer and I should have enjoyed my meal. And while I was away, the mice did not play. They did not play at all."}
{"text":"Excellent service by John. Salad bar is never disappointing. Very clean establishment, no little pieces of food on the floor like some other restaurants."}
{"text":"I read some of the reviews on here and was a bit shocked, I had a very positive experience at this Ruby Tuesday last night (8/17/12).  Like a lot of people I tend to steer clear of chain restaurants.  Especially in a city like Charlotte which has excellent locally owned options on just about every corner.  I always liked Ruby Tuesday for a couple of simple reasons, the menus (both food and beer), the salad bar, The Rolling Stones.  We pulled up around 9pm for dinner, at a lot of chains that's a no-no because they are already running the vacuum and wiping down chairs.  Ruby Tuesday's on Independence sat us immediately, was friendly throughout the greeting process.  Our server was brand new but definitely not lost and didn't require any additional patience from me so that was positive.  Also she was already able to explain the different menus and special selections. For those of you out there who haven't waited tables, it isn't \"easy\" so when somebody knows the ins and outs of a menu in a short amount of time you should recognize their work.  My wife and I each got entrees which allowed us to use the salad bar, which was delicious and still freshly stocked even at 9.30pm.  My dish was a quesadilla, and it was delicious, the steaks looked good on the menu but I rarely order steak in a restaurant (get it, rarely, that's a little cooking temperature pun for ya) because even at fancy pants places in South Park my steak is often improperly cooked.  My wife got shrimp.   The food (even the appetizers and biscuits) all came out quick and extremely hot. Which coincidentally is exactly how I prefer my women as well as my food.   For once, we were actually approached by a manager to *gasp* ask us how our experience was, how our server did, if the food was to our liking.  Not to mention that I actually saw this manager run from table to table and between the front and back of the house consistently throughout the evening.  As we were leaving I told them we would be back and I meant it. I hope that my experience is showing a definite turn around for this restaurant based on the previous comments and reviews.  If so, I would recommend it for quick casual food in the green zone between Charlotte and Matthews off of 74.  Now get back to work."}
{"text":"First and last time we will stop here.  Upon walking in we were told 15-20 wait yet plenty of tables everywhere.  We were seated faster by the next staff member that walked up to check in kiosk.  Service was slow, one server for entire side of restaurant.  Food was not as described.  Husband ordered kale salad and got a Caesar salad.  Took an additional 20 minutes just to get our check.  Upon exiting, my husband almost stepped in someone else's throw up at the door."}
{"text":"Amazing! Our server, Eddie R. made our first taste of Ruby Tuesdays a magical one. Guy had a smile from start to finish... Oh yeah the food was super yummy too. I had the bourbon glazed chicken and thoroughly enjoyed the tangy/sweetness and juiciness of it. Also the salad bar selection was great (first time I've seen edemame at a salad bar) plus a great value. Wish we had one in California!!"}
{"text":"Just finished having dinner at Ruby Tuesday's on Craig in North Las Vegas and I can't believe I'm saying this but it can rival any 5 star restaurant on the Strip!  Had a sirloin steak, cooked perfectly, medium rare, juicy, no veins or marbling at all! Side of zucchini was good, a little garlic and lemon juice would have made them excellent!  Wait wasn't bad, service was good but a little slow at times.  Only comment is that the table was greasy and sticky by the window.  The manager said it was due to the heat but I think it was due to poor table maintenance.  Best value for the money.  Haven't found a deal like this in Southern Nevada since the mob left the casinos.  Music  way too loud for dinner dining."}
{"text":"I stopped into Ruby Tuesday for the second time in the last few months. This time was on a Friday night. It was surprising light of customers. It seems to more popular with an older demographic. Maybe it is the option of a salad bar.  I ordered the smokehouse burger. A fairly standard barbeque and bacon burger. I did not upgrade to the 'grade a' meat option. It was a very average restaurant burger. I was disappointed to have preferred it medium rare to have it come out closer to well done, without a hint of pink inside.  The place is clean. The staff was polite. But, unless you are a huge fan of adding a salad bar to your dinner, there are many more options in the Tempe Marketplace with more flavorful and unique food choices."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly and had great service even though we were a large group. The food was good, and the salad bar was fresh."}
{"text":"Best part was the salad bar.  Chicken tenders were very small and dry from being over cooked.  Fries were stone cold.  My kids were happy with their meals.  Son got a kids pasta was about 30 noodles my other son had an adult bacon cheese burger he liked it but his fries were also cold.  Husband's meal was all warm he had the smokey mt chicken with mashed and mac n cheese.  Probably won;t return for dinner but may stop in for salad bar and the mini burgers."}
{"text":"More of a upscale eatery with decent prices. Classy cocktails and presentation with food. Still good for kids but I wouldn't go if I was coming from work in dirty cloths kinda place."}
{"text":"No more fruit tea? Me and my wife have been here a million times and the ONE BIG reason we still come is because of the fruit tea that has bits of the fruit in it, according to our waitress (and the bartender she spoke with) they never did that even though their menu clearly states \"handcrafted fruit teas: fresh-brewed iced teas with real fruit\" and the fact that we have gotten it a hundred times. Either they are both new and management doesn't know how to train their people or they need to update their menu to say fruit flavored tea. Will more than likely not be returning to this establishment I would recommend Sizzler if your looking for a salad bar or thirsty lion if your looking for a burger or snack food."}
{"text":"Ruby Tuesday as a chain can be very hit or miss.  The location and level of engagement from the staff tend to determine the quality.  This place lived up to its poor rating.  First of all, they had the weirdest cut bar I'd ever seen.  One section on the right had a single seat separate from the main bar.  Is that for lonely people?  Smelly people?  Is it like an isolation chamber that serves alcohol?  The other odd part was the row of seats right next to the kitchen entrance thus ensuring that the entire time you're sitting down there will be MANY people walking briskly behind you.  Some carried hot food while others hoisted dirty plates.  I can't imagine that improving your dining experience.  We sat at the normal part of the bar expecting to get quick service.  I mean, you can almost touch the bartender (did I mention the bar was small?), so the expectation was that he'd be quick.  Nope, I was dead wrong.  Either he was brand spanking new or in no particular hurry.  It took a while to place our order for drinks (he liked to disappear) and then it took another while to place our order for food (again, he's like Houdini).  The salad bar was in rough shape like it had been mugged.  There was bacon strewn across several sections while the remaining parts had meager amounts of vegetables.  My girl had to snag a manager and ask for it to be cleaned and replenished.    My burger came out decent and the wings didn't kill us, so on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs we achieved the bottom level - food that would sustain our bodies.    Was it enjoyable?  Not really.  Will we ever go back?  Hell no.  Do I feel bad for anyone who has to eat there?  Absolutely."}
{"text":"This place has always been a default or compromise destination, never a first pick in the restaurant wars. They follow the Ruby Tuesday playbook and if your expectations are along those lines then you'll enjoy the place. The one wildcard is the service.  I've tried at the tables and at the bar. There's no magic formula to getting good service unlike other locations. It's a roll of the dice no matter where you sit.  The food is somewhat consistent and there are healthy options which is why they beat out the fast food chains nearby. It's a middle-of-the-road kinda place. If your group can't come to a consensus then this restaurant will be least likely to suck."}
{"text":"On opposite side of I85 from Concord Mills Blvd.  Private parking lot Tables, booths, bar and TVs Usually go during lunch hours.  Hostess wanted to sit me right in front of the entrance on a cold day, politely asked for a booth towards back of restaurant so I would not be cold.  Plenty of staff working.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger (bacon could have been cooked a little longer), fries (had to ask them to bring out because they did not serve with burger) and the salad bar (so many choices, very clean and well stocked. Sign up for their rewards program, you will get a free burger or salad bar for your birthday!"}
{"text":"First time to this location Shared parking with shopping center I visited RT on a Tuesday @12:30pm for a $5 salad bar special.  It was very popular and a lot of people there. Lined up about 4 deep to get to salad bar area.  The ladies attending the bar did a fantastic job keeping it stock and cleaned so that everyone could enjoy!  I will definitely be returning to this location due to proximity to the office and ease of getting in and out of the location."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if it's a new company standard, or just this location, but I'm never retuning. Rude service, food was wrong, quantity dropped, quality gone. I know it sounds ghetto, but this place was my favorite place for steak, no longer."}
{"text":"I was there on May 24, 2015.  Kevin T was by far the worse waiter I have had in years. He was clipped and seem like we were bothering him.  He couldn't wait for Carl to finish his question about how the chicken was prepared, he just said everyone loves this dish.  How about waiting for the question?  Then we asked about the biscuits, oh they are in the oven.  We placed our order and I gave him the coupon code.  So we are sitting there waiting.  And then the server brings our meals and Carl asked about the biscuits again...they're in the oven.  The next thing we know Kevin brings them and slams them on our table and said they may not be done.  Exactly they were raw.  I am shaking my head.  He never asked us if the biscuits were raw?  Pretty soon he slams the bill on the table.  And yep it was wrong coupon not taken off. Carl complained to an uncaring manager.  Carl had to leave because he got so frustrated.  This manager said well I guess I will adjust it...what are you talking about honor the coupon!  Then he said as he rolls his eyes I took off the $7.50...like it wasn't a big deal.  It was a big deal...but better yet it could have been part of the tip. They will never know now.  I will never go back to that location.  Horrible."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness.. the new salad bar is amazing!!!!  We loved everything. That is one of those salads that you crave again and again.  I could seriously get this salad bar every day and never be bored or wanting for more."}
{"text":"A group of 10 of us came into this restaurant on Tuesday, all kids under 12 eat free. We had 4 kids with us 3 of which got pizza. The wait was over 45 minutes. The pizza sauce was out of the refrigerator cold on the pizza, when we asked for the pizza to be heated up more the waitress was very rude. We then got charged for every meal when we were told kids are free on Tuesdays. When we asked about our bill our waitress started in with attitude again, walking away before we had finished asking our questions. We asked for every single drink refill as well. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!"}
