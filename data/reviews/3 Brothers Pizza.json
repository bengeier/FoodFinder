{"text":"Loved it. Travelling through and ordered delivery. Service was fast and courteous. While the food was slightly saltier than I would prefer, the pizza was really good. The cheescake was tasty and not too sweet with giant strawberries. Much better than I anticipated!"}
{"text":"Ordered Pizza, Crust was soggy but i ate it & it was pretty good. Next day I pop the pizza in the oven hoping it wouldn't be so soggy a little less soggy but not the best. Also, got some wings they put the sauce on the side, at first I was  a little disappointed but then once I tried the sauce VERY HAPPY teriyaki sauce tasted just like soy sauce what the hell! 2 problems i've never experienced anywhere & for the area, a complete dive lots of great pizza places to try in the area, I might return because of the extensive menu but maybe if they focused on a smaller menu the damn pizza wouldn't be so soggy! Fast delivery"}
{"text":"Great Wings and Pizza.  Super customer service that's why whenever I can I order from here.  They take great pride in their food and service!"}
{"text":"I should have read reviews first.. 45.00 for hardly any food.. My pizza was raw dough. Super soggy and really no taste. Wings were nothing special. Kinda disappointed especially because of the cost. On a positive note the delivery was on time and the driver was super nice."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town. Came across 3 brothers- was NOT disappointed!! Great pizza! ... Seriously great pizza. Calzone also great. Whole family left very satisfied."}
{"text":"George is great? Knowledgeable, efficient and kind. Great customer service. Food was hot and delicious. Great service, great food and reasonable prices"}
{"text":"I am not going to be politically correct.YOUR FOOD SUCKS!!!.I just order a pizza and it sucked.It was BURNT!!!! I won't call your place to hear a bunch of BS.....I will not ever come back to this place,and hope no one esle does..Please don't respond,cause it will not matter to me.When i order something out i expect the food to be good.and NOT BURNT!!! It was take out order,so when i got home and got my food ready to eat the crust was hard as a rock!!!! REALLY!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the customer service is great. Good for family dinner or an adult drink out."}
{"text":"Best take out food we have ever ordered! The florentine ravioli is probablly even better than any italian restaurant around! The staff was also very polite and had a positive attitude. I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I parked in the plaza in front of the store.  The owner came out and asked how long I was going to be parked there, even though there were no signs stating it was \"pizza parking only\".  I told him I would only be 15 min. and I would be in for a slice after that.  I came in to a very clean, but very empty restaurant.  The pizza was soggy and the sauce tasted like tomato paste.  No wonder the owner had nothing better to do than sit by the window and badger people.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"3 Brothers Pizza is probably my favorite pizza outside of the Italian restaurants found in Little Italy. Its a renamed and relocated Pizza King (the reincarnated Pizza King anyways) and serves the same menu for the most part. The pizzas are the best: the cheese is plentiful and cooked just right, they don't skimp on toppings, and the crust is buttered and not too hard not too soft. Aside from the pizza nobody I have tried makes a better cheesy bread and the hot subs are also high on my list. I have yet to dine in because it is usually around midnight when I order from here. The normal prices are kind of high so I always use a coupon. $10 for a medium and cheesy bread or $20 for 2 extra large!"}
{"text":"The high water mark in terms of burgers on this side of town is b-spot.  Ordered the \"OPA burger\" medium rare.   The beef had a nice flavor however was sent out \"well done\".  At this price little details matter.  Not bad, but not great either."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza,  the staff was friendly.  First time won't be the last. .if you are looking for great pizza this is the spot."}
{"text":"Good hand tossed pizza. I had Italian sausage/meatball/green olive. Online ordering was a snap. Fairly quick and very friendly delivery, direct to my hotel room. Cheesecake was standard but delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing gluten free pasta and pizza. Friendly people and we heard the rice pudding is to die for, but was sold out by the time we got there. Anyway, take out or done in, it's worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome Italian food.  Freshly made pasta (not from a box), great sauce.  Went in for pizza but was so tempted by the special (sauted chicken breast with spinach, zucchini, topped with fresh, great tasting tomatoes & feta).  It was a pleasure to eat there.  Go & enjoy the pizza, but don't miss out on trying the other amazing options on their menu!"}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza. Got the XL with sausage and pepperoni. Attentive and friendly service."}
{"text":"Thanks for accommodating our large soccer group tonight!  The food was delicious and your staff was great to work with. As promised, our food was ready when we arrived, and we couldn't have been more pleased"}
{"text":"I recently had the chance to try a pizza at 3 Brothers Pizza. It is very close to my home, so i thought I would give it a try. Middleburg Hts. has so many pizza places but I wanted something different. The pizza was great and the toppings were top notch. I have never gotten a pizza with bacon pieces that big on it before. It was a more expensive than other shops in the area, but the quality of the ingredients made all the difference. I will be back to try some pasta dishes in the future."}
{"text":"I am very picky about pizza and Italian food, but this place is great for somewhere that delivers! The toppings are fresh and plentiful. We ordered a calzone, a pizza and the florentine pasta. I added a side salad with feta to the pasta, and it was definitely worth the extra charge. They use a mixture of greens, not the usual nasty iceberg that pizza places usually use. I had the house vinaigrette and it was amazing! I would strongly recommend. The price was kind of high, but we ate every bite and I guess you get what you pay for. This might be my new favorite delivery place."}
{"text":"Bruschetta was amazing! Pizza is excellent; we tried the pepperoni. Also really enjoyed the antipasto salad. Service very friendly and accommodating. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Didn't know what to expect..stopped here on a whim..small quant restaurant...but white cheese garlic pizza and cheesy bacon fries were great..crust of pizza was awesome..met the owner and his mother..he was on last year master chef with Gordon Ramsey were he make it in the top 40 out of 45,000 chefs"}
{"text":"Owner extremely friendly and welcomimg!! Pizza is ridiculously good and surprisingly shocked me. Coming from chicago I was not expecting this. Definitely come and visit and enjoy the food!!"}
{"text":"Went here last night and ordered a large cheese pizza and the mozzarella luna ($8 for fried mozzarella, oooook).  When I got to the store at my quoted wait time I still had to wait several minutes, which is not that big of a deal.  When I got home and went to eat the fried mozzarella I had found that the cheese had leaked out of the breading and we had been served what were essentially empty breading shells... for $8.  This is aggravating because the breading was completely flat, so the workers who prepared our order had to have known what they were giving me.  Whatever, I was starving, so we moved on to the pizza.  Inside of the pizza box we found a dead bee.  Yes, a dead bee.  I photographed it and the pics are attached.  The pizza itself was sloppily made, and as another reviewer mentioned, it had barely any cheese on it, and it's a cheese pizza.  The pizza also had soggy black blobs on the bottom of it.  I'm assuming this was charred leftovers from previous pizzas.  Anyway, we won't be back, and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.  There's a Jet's Pizza right across the street, and while it's a chain, and not the best pizza, at least they won't serve you empty breading and a bee."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday at noon for lunch. Was served by George who was extremely polite, almost over the top. 

Started with a chicken, spinach, white bean, pesto soup that took a long time to come out, but was outstanding. 

Had a glass of the house red, made by the Strongsville Brew Kettle's wine store. Described as a Pinot-Merlot, it hit the nail on the head. Light and a bit fruity. Not my fav, but exactly as described. 

Wife had the sausage sub which was huge and very good. I had the BBQ burger which was just ok. Described as having blue cheese slices in it, was actually a blue/Swiss mix. Couldn't taste the blue at all. Also had the distinct taste of Open Pit as the BBQ sauce, which I later found out it was. Not a fan. They also give the beef some kind of credit to a New York famous beef place. My only thought goes back to that salsa commercial a few years ago, where everyone is sitting by a camp fire and comparing the labels on there salsa. The good one from Texas, the other from NEW YORK CITY!?!?!?

The fries with the burger had a nice seasoning on them, but were nothing special. Most days, I would give this a 3, but I like the effort and dedication to local suppliers, including Ohio City Pasta."}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza and service I have ever had! It is not just the pizza that's amazing, the fettuccine alfredo is just to die for and their burgers?! Don't even get me started with the amount of yum in those!"}
{"text":"Updated review. This place is a really good place to get pizza. Love the crust and sauce. Especially on half priced Monday. One of the better pizzas in Cleveland when they are paying attention and on their game. 

The Alfredo is freaking amazing. On a pizza or just dipping their pasta bread in it. It's so bad (calorie wise) but so dang good taste wise. 

The reason for a drop in rating...they don't seem be able to cook chicken well. Fried or grilled. The fried always seems to come out slightly burned on the edges. Oil may be too hot. And the grilled chicken always seems stringy or something. Not sure if is prepackaged or fresh grilled chicken. I would say prepackaged. Also found out their pasta is bought from Ohio City pasta. It is really good pasta. Just wished they could do better chicken with it."}
{"text":"I had never been to 3 Brothers but I received a birthday coupon in the mail so I thought I'd try it. I went on Monday which is half price specialty pizza day. The extra large pizza was $24.00. Half would be $12. My coupon was worth $14 so I thought I had it covered. Zero on the pizza, plus my drink (required), plus tip. NOPE! I told the server before I ordered, I had a coupon and she said I could use it on anything except appetizers. The bill comes and it's $13 and change. I asked why and she said because it can't be used with other offers. So basically I didn't use the coupon and just got the pizza on the Monday special. It would have been nice if she was more clear on the stipulations. I would have ordered something else. 
The food was ok. Definitely not a $24 pizza. The ambiance was like eating in a school basement with painted cinder block walls. 
Not happy. Overpriced. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Damn you! Damn you! Damn you! Why did you make me eat the whole thing?!?! 
    Ok, we've just finally tried this local independent joint. I'd call it a pizzeria but it seems to be so much more. I called to order and talked to very helpful guy whom I think is the owner. He asked if I was a new customer and then walked me through my options, patiently answering my questions.
  We ordered a pasta dinner, a calzone and a pizza for the kid. All were delicious. The pizza was good and cheesy with a rich sauce. The spaghetti bolognese had a nice meaty sauce and was big enough to share. (Also noteworthy; they advertised that they use Ohio City Pasta. I like to see the hometown collaboration) My 3Brothers calzone was to die for. The damn thing was HUGE!!!!! I couldn't help myself, I had to kill that thing. 
   There was a chilled case of delicious looking Cannoli and other desserts. I also noticed that they had their own wine. We'll have to try wine and desert next time. We'll definitely be going back. They also have a yelp check in deal!!"}
{"text":"Friendly fast incredible, try the soup and it comes with cheese bread very filling and perfect in this crazy weather, sure to warm you."}
{"text":"I ordered this pizza because I wanted something that wasn't a big chain. You know try something new. And since I hadn't eaten since 1230pm I thought pizza would be the way to go. I order pizza they say 45 min. My pizza arrives an hour fifteen min later.  No call nothing. I asked for plates and napkins got nothing. The pizza lacked sauce and cheese and overall taste. The crust was so soggy I could hardly eat it. The highlight the cheesey breadsticks. $25 wasted luckily its a business expense or they'd have to refund my money"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout for the second time tonight. I must say, this time I was much more impressed. Our first experience with 3 Brother's was prior to their grand opening (they had a soft opening). They've now been open a couple of months and they seem to be doing well.

I didn't order wings this time, although I should have. I'm curious to see if they're better than they were the first time. Time will tell. This time, we ordered two pizzas: an extra large white garlic pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms and a small pepperoni pizza. Both were absolutely delicious! 

The crust on both pies wasn't soggy like it was the first time I was there. It was crisp and chewy--just the way I like it. The garlic sauce was delicious and not overpowering. It wasn't greasy like white sauce can be. It was ideal. The red sauce on the small pizza, as I said in my last review, was just as amazing as it was then. Mildly sweet. Not overly acidic. Definitely different from other sauces pizza chains offer. It really sets 3 Brothers apart from the rest. 

Toppings this time around were more than sufficient. We didn't order extra cheese and there was still plenty of cheese. My daughter said, \"this is the best pizza cheese she'd ever eaten.\" Coming from a picky nine year old, that means a lot. The pepperoni slices were both beneath the cheese in some places and above it, so there was a nice balance between crispy and tender. Perfect. The mushrooms on the white pizza were also fresh. Again, I have nothing bad to say about this. This pizza was perfect. 

Glad to have you in the neighborhood, 3 Brother's. It's nice to have a sit down restaurant within walking distance, too. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm slightly conflicted about this review because I really love the people that work here, especially the owner, so I will lay out the good and bad as I see things.

Good:

- Customer service. When my wife and I came in here for late night take out, they always offered free soft drinks and good conversation. I come from the school where service reigns above all else. That and a clean place, and they are on top of things in this department as well.

- Hours are good, open late. That's a plus for second shift types like us. Closed Sunday, but it's the Sabbath(may be technically Saturday but whatever), I understand.

Bad:

- Prices are high, which isn't really an issue, but the food has been a little inconsistent. Pizza is a bit heavy and soggy, but I like a thinner, NYC type so it could just be me. The calamari was way too salty. The pasta dishes I've had were pretty good, along with the sandwiches.

Honestly, I haven't been here in a few months because of my schedule, so maybe some of the kinks have been ironed out. 

George, if you're reading, get a thin crust pizza on the menu and tone down the salt a bit. Wife and I both wish you much prosperity.

Going to try and get back soon."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best, was expecting a lot better than that.  Calzone was good, but I've had better from places like Pizza Pan, which says a lot.  Also ordered a specialty pizza and it came with a free cheese pizza that had barely any cheese on it, and burnt as well.  Maybe we'll try again someday. Maybe...."}
{"text":"They treat you like family and they have gluten free options love this place definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Pepperoni Magnifico.  That is all you need to know before ordering."}
{"text":"Walked in...excited to try for first time based on reviews....no one approached us, no one said hello, one moment.  Waited for as long as my hungry tummy would allow then walked out.  The gentleman behind the bar made eye contact with us, but nothing"}
{"text":"Great food! I have been here numerous times and the food and service is always great. The food is fresh, homemade and so flavorful. The portion sizes are very large. My most recent meal was the eggplant Parmesan. Delicious! It comes with a large portion of eggplant, a side of pasta, and fresh garlic bread. I also added on soup for $2. For me, my husband, and daughter our bill was only around $40. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Pizza Hut is wayyyy better quality. This place is going on my DO NOT ORDER FROM list. The saltiest pizza, detest winds and the cheese bread is burnt on the sides, almost raw on the middle. No thanx. Never again.by the way, the marinara sauce is bland. Seems like diced tomatoes from a can. Sloppy work, chef. Sloppy."}
{"text":"My family came for a visit and my mom has celiacs so she cant eat gluten. She wanted a.pizza I called 6 places and only 2had gluten free pizza these guys had pasta also. We all got two pizzas and spaggetti. The pizzas were thin crusted and very tasty. Homemade sauce a little sweet for my taste but good over all. The white pizza very good. One of.the owners/ brothers came over very personable asking.if.things are good helpjng clear the tables it was a great experience. I reccommend thisplace for sure"}
{"text":"Staff is always very friendly. They have great happy hour specials. The food is always excellent. I have not tried anything that I did not like. The portions are huge. I always leave stuffed with leftovers for tomorrow.  One of my new favorites in Cleveland."}
{"text":"OMG, first of all George is amazing and so passionate about the business. 2nd, all the food is so good, one dish is literally better than the next. I always get the Pasta Bake but decided to try the Florentine Ravioli tonight and I think this may be my new favorite. Also love their house wine...both the red and white are delicious! If you haven't tried this place, just go- everything is great!"}
{"text":"We had their pepperoni pizza, homemade spaghetti, and garlic bread. All of it was amazing!!! We will definitely be going back. :)"}
{"text":"My first time ordering from here and the experience was amazing. The man that took my order was so polite, answered my questions and made recommendations. I ordered the philly pizza and added tomatoes with the butter sauce. It is hands down my new favorite pizza! I will be ordering from them a lot in the future. 

I also ordered a side salad with cheese and it was great except for the packet of Italian dressing."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and good service. They have some of the best gluten free pizza I've ever had. They serve wine, no full bar but it was a good glass and a nice pour. The only reason I gave it one star of was that I think the gluten free pizza is over prices and the decor is fine, but nothing to write home about. 

Overall I would recommend this place for a fun pizza night out :)"}
{"text":"Service was phenomenal. Went with a party of 20. Had wings, pizza, subs, appetizers, dessert. Everything was hot, fresh, tasty. Place was clean, spacious! Must come here again. Only suggestions for improvements would be to place pitchers of sodas ordered on tables to save time for both party and server and speed up check out process."}
{"text":"Thought the place was really good. Menu is full of house-made items. I had the specialty meat pizza and loved it. Awesome sauce. Great service too."}
{"text":"I don't celebrate this day that many Ohioans refer to as 'Sweetest Day'. But I do like to eat. At least daily. So I invited one of my favorite single gals out for some food.  And off we went! 

Guess where we went!? Need some hints?  Okay. Everything is painted red. It's really really incredibly bright inside. There's shiny waxed floors. Music playing. And a employee with a red shirt and khaki pants on.  Oh wait. No, no red shirt and khaki pants. That's Target. But combine all the other clues, add some tables, some pizza, and some pasta and you've got 3 Brothers! Our dining destination for the evening.  With absolutely zero romantic ambiance this was a excellent pick for the night. 
First off our server and service was great. The waitress was very friendly, helpful, and acted like she really wanted us to have a nice time. It was service you don't see to often anymore and darnit if I knew her name I'd put it right here! But I forgot it. Cause that's what guys do. So, we started off with a order of cheesy bread that was really good. Plenty of melted cheese and a good garlic flavor. It came with a side of marinara sauce.  Why does everyone serve marinara dipping sauce cold? Is it just me that may want it warmed to match the temperature of the food? If anyone has the answer or prefers theirs cold please contact me at once. I need answers.  Every restaurant I've ever been to serves it cold so I'm not holding it against anyone or anything. But I just wonder why. Anyways..  My gal pal ordered their Philly Cheesesteak sub. And after asking our server about their chicken fettuccine alfredo I decided to go with that (photos uploaded). She really liked her sub. She said it was toasted perfectly and the bread had some baked on seasoning that made it special. My dish was pretty good as well. The alfredo sauce was rich and, without sounding too much like goldilocks, not too thin and not too thick. But just right. I think the chicken could have used a bit more flavor but overall a satisfying dinner. I didn't think about it until I got home but I believe I was supposed to receive a piece of garlic bread with my pasta but never did. So you were supposed to receive a review of said garlic bread but never will. How's that make you feel? Me too. 
At the end the manager came over and thanked us for eating there. It was nice. 

All-in-all it was a good to great experience that I'd recommend to others. Especially if you want to take someone to dinner and let the lack of romantic ambiance say (without actually saying) \"Hey this is a 100% friend-zone dinner so your picking up your half of the check\". 3 Brothers did try and make an effort to spice things up in the dining room for Sweetest Day. They had heart shaped balloons tied to the back of chairs and were giving out free dessert pizzas. But with lightsas bright as a football stadium it's just not that kinda place."}
{"text":"We were SO disappointed!!! 

Because of how delicious the food looked in the pictures on Yelp and because of reviews I saw, we went here. ALL of the food was mediocre at best. We ordered the fried moz and the cheese was chewy. We both orders calzones and the crust wasn't crunchy and it wasn't hot inside. We also both got dessert, my husbands cannoli was soggy and my cheesecake tasted like it came out of a box. My Caesar salad didn't taste like Caesar at all. 

The coffee was good and our server was nice, but she was busy and not attentive. 

On top of all this, it is VERY expensive! We could have had a full meal in a restaurant for what we paid to eat at a pizza place 

This is a one and done for us."}
{"text":"I love this place. Most people think this is just a pizza shop. Entirely not true. They have a full menu and a nice wine list. The portions were large and the price was reasonable. They also have a great selection of deserts. 
Service and staff were friendly and courteous. They all seem to love working there and like the owner .
Love it!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate here recently and it was such a surprise. A good friend of ours frequents it with her family and always raves about it so we decided to go. It's now my go to spot for gluten free pizza and surprisingly... wine. 

We went on a Monday night and it was half off specialty pizzas (dine-in only). The interior was nice, it was clean, and quiet. About three or four couples in there. It was nice for having a conversation over dinner. 

I had a gluten free white garlic pizza with pepperoni and onion. It was cooked just right. It wasn't burnt or crispy like some gluten free pizza's are. Pizza places have to be careful with gluten free pizzas or they burn easily and it's like chewing on a stone board. They nailed it on this one though. The garlic sauce was good, but not over powering. 

My girlfriend had the 3 brothers supreme pizza on their normal crust. She loved it. I snagged some Italian sausage off it and it was pretty yummy too. 

My favorite part of the night was when the server asked if I'd like some wine. I asked about their house wine and she offered to bring two samples over that we could try. One of the house white and one of the house red. The white was good, but the red was amazing. I asked about what type of wine it was and she said she'd grab her manager to explain. He came over and was super friendly. I got the vibe that he was one of the owners and instead of making me feel like I was burdening him, he was joyful in talking about it and making sure I had a great experience. He told me all about the wine and who made it for them and what flavors you experience. Although I can't remember the particulars, it was a red wine that has a wonderful berry flavor to it. I bought an extra bottle to go and am going back soon to grab another bottle.

Overall, the food was good, the server and owner were very friendly and made you feel like they were not only there to serve you, but that they ultimately took joy in it. We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Really good pizza besides my toppings fell off a little, wings were great nice and crispy, cheesy bread was good too, that is all we ordered.  The staff seemed very friendly, would recommend to try!"}
{"text":"3 words: BEST. PIZZA. EVER. I had 3 Brother's pizza today for the first time and it was delicious! It was cooked perfectly and their sauce is what really makes it. The sauce is very flavorful and a bit sweet. They definitely got it right. 

I tried the mushroom pizza and the pepperoni with sausage. Both were very satisfying. We ordered delivery and it came exactly when they said it would. I will definitely be recommending this place to others. The large pizza and a 2 liter of pop was $21. A little expensive but the pizza was huge and it was delish! My new pizza spot :) yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here randomly one night in search of pizza and were so pleasantly surprised! Especially given the exterior, we weren't expecting a sit-down place with both pizza and Italian food options. 

Our server was so friendly and on top of her tables. The food was phenomenal! Such an amazing value too considering the portion sizes. We split 2 large pizzas, and a large Greek salad between the four of us and left full with leftovers for the next day. The pizza itself was great, tons of high quality toppings and the original crust was the perfect thickness. 

The cherry on top of the experience was when the owner came by to greet us and ask how our dinner was. He seemed so nice and genuine and appreciative of our business. We will definitely be back! 

My only critique would be the decor and lighting. It feels a little bit sportsbar like and dark inside with the colors. The tables are good, but we just wish it was more upscale / romantic since the food is so delicious."}
{"text":"What a great surprise to find this cute sit down restaurant so close to home. We thought is was only a take out pizza place and it is so much more. Clean, open, classy décor, not the regular take out motif. They have a full menu, and the pizzas are wonderful. On Mondays it is half price on all their specialty pizzas, and they are very tasty. We got their Hawaiian Pizza and it was loaded with toppings. We only ordered a medium pizza to share between two people and we had two slices left over. It was really filling. They only have wine right now because they are still waiting on their beer license. The wine was a little expensive but they do have a good selection. The staff could not have been more helpful and efficient. We will defiantly go back and make it a regular stop on Mondays. They are also open for lunch."}
{"text":"Been wanting to get their pizza for awhile since liking their FB page, saw that they're having their 4 year anniversary post on FB yesterday so I decided to take my family & my daughter's fiance, so instead of getting 1 extra large pie wee got individual pies 50% off so we can have what we wanted, I got the large meat lovers thick crust & I tell you that was one of the best pizzas we ever had. 

    We now have another go to spot for pizza, next time I'm going try something different the sandwiches looked awesome, dessert was great we had the Oreo cream dessert, we were greeted as soon as we walked in & asked if it was our first time, the staff was on point on refilling our drinks always checking up on us if we needed anything, I highly recommend them & give them a try, sent my friend a picture of my pizza pie & he wss amazed on how great it looked, only if I can give 10 stars or more.

    I would like to personally thank them for a great dining experience. The owners should be proud of their employees & every restaurant should take example of them. The restaurant was busy & I've observed each employee very attentive to everyone, keep up the great job..."}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight, the food was good (burger was fair) but the desserts were disappointing! We brought home cannoli and baklava, both were bad. The crust on both were moist and not crisp! We are the chocolate peanut butter parfait there and it was fair...we are here before Christmas and it was great! 

The service was good!!"}
{"text":"My entire family (a party of 10) recently visited Three Brothers and it was a great experience. Very welcoming and casual, I felt like I was at home. George was our waiter and he was friendly, informative, and attentive. And you could tell that he, as one of the three brothers, is so proud of the business! It was so cute :) The service was excellent, and the food was fresh, high quality, and very tasty. I split the pasta bake with my sister and it was definitely enough for two! Pizza was delicious too. Everyone enjoyed their meal (and local wine!) Unfortunately for me, I don't live in the area, but I will definitely be back when I'm visiting the family!"}
{"text":"I wanna love this place, it's minutes from my house, and has old school sit down arcade games.  But the food is decent at best, and below average the majority of times.  It's a family run place, with a Greek influence.  The menu is the usual with some out of the normal items.  They do offer a gluten free za, which is a must for us, but it is pretty expensive comparatively.   The toppings never seem to be cooked enough, and are often still hard.  The majority of the times I've been in there waiting for takeout, there have been issues with other orders."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was great. Pizza was worth the price. Delivery was fast and courteous. I would recommend this establishment to anyone."}
{"text":"This is the nearest pizzeria from my house and one of the best within a 5 mile radius. I'm a fan of their veggie supreme pizza. They have nice offers going on from time to time which is cool"}
{"text":"I'd rather stick to any other pizza place than this one. Our pizza was very bland and nothing special about it . Our calzone was good though, I'll give them that :("}
{"text":"Just started ordering from 3 Brothers after getting a couple fliers/coupons in the mail. Hey, this stuff is good. The sauce, cheese and crust on the pizza are tasteful, well proportioned and fresh. I really like it. Thank you for frying the meaty nice sized wings and not baking them. Wings are meant to be fried then sauced.  The mild sauce is just like Franks original wing sauce. Easy to make but oh so perfect! The cheese breadsticks are the final touch on every delivery order we place. Soft and cheesy with a side of rich marinara. Yep. I'm getting hungry. 

I think the prices are beyond reasonable. Anyone who thinks they aren't needs to stick with Giant Eagles take n bake. Nough said.  I do agree, Xl should not be called Xl. It truly is just a large by current Midwest, obesity crazed, super size everything standards, however it was enough to feed two adult females and a 20 yr old male (accompanied by 10 wings and breadsticks).  $25 bucks and you're all set. 

3 Brothers has joined the ranks of my top 3 places in the area for pizza and wings, and number 1 on price and service alone. 

PS. Hey Timmy, you joined Yelp just to write your one review.  Who's the fraud?"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just moved from California and we stumbled across 3 brothers! Excellent service and awesome food! I am obsessed with their homemade Alfredo. It's not just pizza, they have burgers subs pasta, and a great variety of appetizers, they also have fresh homemade soups.there's something everyone in the family will like no doubt! and What's cool too is it is family owned  and the managers always make an effort to greet you and see how you're enjoying your visit. It's a must, if you're a big foodie like me then you'll love 3 brothers pizza!"}
{"text":"3 Brothers is a great place to get pizza at a reasonable price. Best pizza around in my opinion."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the waitress was very helpful and accommodating since I need to eat Gluten Free meals due to being a coeliac."}
{"text":"Fresh everything.  I ordered a calzone and a hawaian pizza . Both great . Lite flavor though . I appreciate the fresh ingredients more than I could write about them."}
{"text":"Great place to sit down and enjoy a quiet dinner.  Small place with very few people on a Thursday evening.  I ordered the mozzarella Luna (which was amazing) and it was perfect size for an appetizer.  We got the Sicilian sub (also amazing! Must try!) and the fettuccini alfredo with shrimp (my wife loved it!), the loaded bacon and cheese fries were so-so but everything else was great.  We will be returning for sure!"}
