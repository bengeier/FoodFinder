{"text":"Went there 1st time last night, met the owner and our family had a great meal.  Will definitely be back food was great and atmosphere was welcoming.  Owner was very knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is great! Fresh, easy, and extremely health conscious. Large menu of healthy items that never seem to disappoint. 

The staff is always on top of their game with the fresh food and smoothies. 

HIGHLY RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"This is the best place for gluten free AND vegan meals. The meal is expanded so there's so much more variety. The bread for the sandwiches is even homemade from scratch. That means NO preservatives! Yum!"}
{"text":"Celiac-safe! Love this place. Great lunch (chicken rice bowl with spicy mango sauce). Friendly staff, great variety, knowledgeable owner. Can't wait to come back to enjoy great food & support a great local business!"}
{"text":"I absolutely hate Yelp! but I love this place.. excellent service and great food.  I've tried a couple things and they're all good so far."}
{"text":"Just a place to avoid. Most of their sandwiches are based in chicken and they are running out of it today, just one option left, veggies or turkey. I took my sandwich away and when I arrived home and take a look in the box I was amazed by the greens on the side. I dont have words, just a couple of pictures is enough."}
{"text":"I had a terrible time eating GF my first night in LasVegas.  So I took a cab ride out to this bakery first thing the next morning.  The sandwich they made me was awesome.  So incredibly delicious.  The carribean green smoothie was also very delicious.  The pumpkin sweet potato protein muffins were good too.  I didnt care for blueberry lemon protein muffins or vegan dragon fruit cheesecake but someone else might.  The best thing was I felt safe eating there and the chefs were lovely people who made me feels welcome and were so hospitible.  Plus my bill was reasonable too.  All in all a lovely experience.  Viva la great grubbin'!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a unique place, offering a range of foods not easily found elsewhere, but promising to be healthy and flavorful.  For what it is, I think it hits its mark.  So what is it?

If you are looking for good food that has all those nutritional oddities like gluten-free, vegan, all natural, and high protein content, they offer some great options.  Unfortunately, although everything I tried tasted very fresh and very good, it lacked qualities of \"standard\" ingredients.  Still, for what it is, the food was flavorful, extremely fresh and quite satisfying.  If you are on a special diet but don't want to forgo the flavor, here is your source for healthy foods with real flavors.

Ambiance? not really.  Not really a cafe or a restaurant, it is more like a lunch counter.  I would consider this a great source for a take-out healthy lunch but don't take a date there for dinner.

My wife has to avoid gluten so she tried a GF sandwich.  Have you ever had Franz GF bread in the Pacific Northwest?  The bread at Great Grubbing doesn't touch it.  But compared to Udi's or Rudi's bread commonly found here in LV grocery stores, it is much, much better.  The other ingredients in the sandwich were fresh and flavorful though not particularly unique.

I tried the teriyaki chicken, which was in a prepared bowl.  Though ready-made, which they then heat up for you, it still tasted very fresh.  I would consider it a light lunch portion.

Because of the light meal, I had plenty of room for a piece of GF Mocha cheesecake.  It was very light and tasty, slightly dry and had what appeared to be some remnant coffee grinds in it.  Again, not fantastic but it definitely hits its mark for what it is.

So if you're looking for a quick bite to eat that will energize you and taste great, here is your source."}
{"text":"I love it here. I had a chicken sandwich on vegan bread. They have tons of different options to pick from. The bulletproof coffee is great too. Definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I recently visited Great Grubbing for the first time and was extremely impressed by the food and the staff. I enjoyed the pumpkin roll while my daughter thoroughly enjoyed a vegan pizza. The staff was extremely friendly and the service was great. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone not only vegan/gluten free customers. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Had a terrible experience. Wanted to order the French toast off of the menu and was told they are working on it and it's not available. Decided to order the vegan pancakes instead. After waiting 15 minutes, they came out and told me my waffles weren't working out...I told them I ordered pancakes and she said, \"oh yeah, the pancakes aren't working out.\" Ordered the veggie burger which was recommended by the staff and was extremely disappointed. It was not good at all...I would recommend buying a frozen veggie burger and cooking it yourself. My boyfriend ordered an egg omelette w/ veggies which came out 30 minutes after ordering. The veggies were very tiny, almost as small as the omelette (size of your palm). We spent over $30 on a veggie burger, omelette, and 2 coffees. The owner was nice enough to bring us protein bites but definitely did not make up for the bad food and service. Never recommending this place or going back again."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend. Service was functional but not friendly. Owner had a take it or leave it attitude i.e. purchasing food and drinks was a bother. The drinks did not taste good and are not even that good for you. You can get better protein drinks at whole foods or at your local gym.  Chocolate brownie bland. Would not go again and would not recommend. Didn't like the food and drinks and don't need the attitude."}
{"text":"Pizza and green smoothie was 5 stars. The other bakes goods and pies were 4stars, but for gluten free, it makes them a 5. I really enjoyed the staff and service, they were friendly and helpful selecting items. We will go here every time we are in town."}
{"text":"DOPE. I got the vegan protein wrap and my sister got the BLT. Both were outstanding. Going back for sure."}
{"text":"Owner is so passionate about the food and his business, he let me treat this place like my own personal work station this morning, while I was able to grab some coffee, breakfast and work for an hour before my meetings for the day. They have free wifi and are so friendly. I loved the bullet proof coffee options and banana pancakes!!"}
{"text":"I just found this place. They are totally gluten free. Their pizza is great. It has a flavorful sauce, choose regular or spicy and quality toppings with many choices. They make amazing cheesecakes in multiple flavors. You can buy a slice or a whole cake. I have so much more to try. I am excited and totally recommend this to anyone who is gluten sensitive or anyone who is just trying to eat healthier. Support Small Business!"}
{"text":"Great selection.  Awesome crew.  Very cool vibe.   The smoothies are reasonably priced and tasty.   I will be back with the kids soon."}
{"text":"I'm in love with the Pumpkin Smoothie.  This is like drinking a pumpkin pie without all the guilt!! Their pre made bowls are excellent as well.  Fresh tasting and flavorful.  Looking forward to trying many other items on their menu as well as their baked good."}
{"text":"After a day of running errands, I had one more stop at a shop next to Great Grubbing. I was hot, hungry and looking for a new, healthy option. I looked up, saw the sign, including \"gluten-free\" option. What an nice surprise!! A place closer to my home in Boulder City! Had a gluten-free friend along. We split a chicken teriyaki pizza and a chicken bowl with brown rice.
The place was clean, the employees and owner were super friendly and helpful, and the food was loaded with FRESH cooked veggies, flavorful seasonings and the piazza crust was excellent with good texture. We had lots of food to share and take home for later. Reasonably priced!!! 
Will definitely be returning to try some of the other interesting options!"}
{"text":"Awesome place %100  gluten free friendly staff and amazing owners it's a must try if your in the neighborhood and wanting something new."}
{"text":"Gluten-free sure, but unfortunately lacking in healthy choices. 
Went for breakfast. Smoothie was the most horrible one I have ever had in my life. Full of vanilla and stevia (and low-quality powdered protein).
Not real eggs- rubbery and cold, junk food disguised as healthy food.
The bread was yukky- rice with tapioca starch.
If you want gluten-free processed junk food, go for it."}
{"text":"Ordered today for the first time through UberEats and the food was delicious.  I ordered the turkey burger with a side salad and everything was spot on, including the bun!!  Can't wait to order form here again and try everything!!!"}
{"text":"Love Kenny and his awesome staff not to mention the food is amazing and healthy! My teenagers even devoured the cheesecake I brought home and said they couldn't tell that it was \"healthy\". So grab yourself a breakfast sandwich with a side of Bullet Proof coffee and make it a great day!!!"}
{"text":"Due to my sensitive baby, I'm on a vegan-ish diet right now. And boy do I miss breakfast. And treats.  So I was so excited to find this place!  Vegan waffles! And tons of other options!

There was a setback with my order, and while it wasn't a deal breaker, it was annoying all the same.  But I expected the same lack of care I get at most restaurants. So I cannot tell you how surprised and impressed I was when the owner came out with my food, apologized, and threw in 2 vegan treats for free.  I would have been happy with the apology.  The free treats were above and beyond.  That's how you treat customers. I'll be back again and again.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Staff is super friendly and enthusiastic about their dynamic range of choices.  Even took the time to educate me on how they add protein to coffee without disrupting the taste. Very friendly to newbies!  Try the pink dragon smoothie,  it's refreshing!"}
{"text":"Excellent and amazing gluten free cafe! The make your own salads and sandwiches are always an excellent option! 

Plus the smoothies and gluten free protein muffins are delicious."}
{"text":"My fellow vegans, don't be fooled !!! Sadly brought my family here to end our Vegas food and it was not a good decision. The food was flavorless , pancake was over cooked but batter was undercooked , bread was stale , biscuit and gravy was watery and bland . The tofu isn't organic ( meaning GMO) . I really had high hopes for this  but was extremely disappointed . Great service and staff was truly amazing but I suggest seeking other food options ."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious! Great recommendation!  The hummus wrap!  Also takes PayPal payments.  Great Grubbing is the truth!"}
{"text":"The sweet potato muffins are amazing and impossible to tell that it's got all good things in it and the sweet pie taste better than a pie loaded with sugar and is moist and filled with flavor! The creator ain't that bad of a dude either!"}
{"text":"Very cool place and soooooo refreshing an addition to Las Vegas. I really hope they stick around. I need them! Organic coffee is just plain smart (people need to wise up about this -- coffee is one of the most heavily-sprayed crops, and uh...pesticides are cancer-causing. Why not drink organic???), gluten free donuts and cookies (for those of us who actually can't eat wheat -- yes, we exist and those of us who do have these diet restrictions aren't on some \"fad diet.\" Nice that there are some businesses in the valley that recognize this fact.)  I'll be back. The owner, I believe, was so incredibly friendly and generous. I wish him all the best and I will be back as frequently as I can!"}
{"text":"Closed Saturday Sundays.  But still decided to try some protein muffins,  not too bad. My oldest daughter had a biscuits and gravy,  a bit dry.  The youngest had a smoothie on the way home.  I am not sure if a vegan place uses different pots and pans for the meat products,  but neither here nor there. 
Fun funky graphics in the store,  but the short asian owner had a bit of an attitude,  rude.  
Never again."}
{"text":"So glad this place is now open on sunday. Gluten free desserts great smoothies and healthy food."}
{"text":"Got a club sandwich, only thing with any flavor on it was the onions. Bread was pretty hard. Wouldn't recommend to anyone. Service was good though. So, basically, quickly served bland food."}
{"text":"I've now been dining at Great Grubbing for over a year and each time it gets better! The owner, Kenny, is always introducing new items to the menu, all being 100% Gluten Free!! I personally do not have any gluten sensitivities but enjoy good, high quality food. That is just want I get every time I eat here! Thank you for doing what you do! I tell everyone to try this place atkeast once and do your best to not be hooked!"}
{"text":"I love bakeries. Clearly. So I will give any bakery a chance, even one that is gluten free or vegan or whatever. Desserts are desserts, right?!?!

I got a piece of Cookies and Cream Cheesecake and some \"donut\" thing. The cheesecake tasted like Banana, which was bizarre and it just tasted...not real. The donut tasted like not much of anything. 

I went from one to two stars because the people there were really nice. Unfortunately, I can't go back. I need something that I want to eat and I did not want to eat this.

Bummer. On to the next dessert place!"}
{"text":"Great grubbing is truly great! I go there all the time for their amazing protein smoothies and protein muffins. Everything is so fresh and affordable. I highly recommend their salads and protein donuts. Also, if you watch your sugar intake, they have plenty of sweet treats that won't kill your diet."}
{"text":"There needs to be more stimulation for these poor fish and one frog. Food is great but hate coming in to see this big tank with absolutely nothing in for these fish have to swim around and get some sort of stimulation. 


Think of being locked up in a jail cell with glass walls and nothing inside for you to do. 

The frogs should be in at least a group of 2, and they need something to hide behind. 

We have been here when the fish tank was really dirty and also had more goldfish, I'll just assume they died. 

Would you want to be that fish or frog in the tank?"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. I tried the Vegan burger that I thought would be nasty, but it tasted GREAT!!! The employees there were helpful and polite. Great service guys!!! Will definitely be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Ask for Kenny.. He is super nice and super helpful! I am a gluten free vegan and they have lots of options!"}
{"text":"Great customer service! Everyone was so nice and helpful. Ordered cheesecake and a chocolate cupcake. Delicious! Next time will be trying a pizza"}
{"text":"Great variety of healthy options. Their iced coffee is super smooth. Thin crust pizza completely satisfied my pizza crave, and didn't leave me falling into a food coma. Excellent service and both Co-owners were very helpful. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"I love this place and the owner! Food is so good and I love that is all healthy choices for me so I won't go off track! The pumpkin cookies are to die for!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place. They have the best treats, sandwiches, salads and do NOT forget to get a smoothie! The people are so friendly and make sure you are well taken care of. Anything u need they have covered! Thanks Great Grubbing for our new favorite place!!!!"}
{"text":"Great Grubbing made our holiday party so hassle free, as they made gluten-free gingerbread man cookies for our clients. We were pleased with the flavor and freshness of the cookies.  Also, great customer service !"}
{"text":"I have been vegan for a year now. So I am always looking for great new vegan places to eat.

Hubby saw all the great reviews online so we were all excited to try it.

We ordered 2 burgers , vegan  biscuits and gravy and  vegan pancakes with blueberries.

Total $40 . WTF . REALLY . I am all into supporting local business (we owned a restaurant ) here in town , but REALLY $40.

First off the burger DOES not come with fries or a choice of side.
My husband said the burger was okay. 

My biscuits and gravy was flavorful , but just ok. 

The pancakes were HORRIBLE , first of  they were kid size pancakes . 6 VERY SMALL silver dollar size . I thought the blueberries would be on top , no in the batter AND I am not sure what was inside the pancakes ( I am guessing apple sauce ) but it was GROSS . I ate one and could not handle more than that one. even with syrup .

I was HUGELY disappointed , I miss regular food and was so excited to try their food.

Alas we will not be going back , sorry guys , we tried ..

NOT worth the money or upsetting my  taste buds ."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to eat! 

The entire place is gluten free! Yet the food is amazing and such variety! 

The staff is so friendly and helpful. I eat here almost every day.... :)

It has been a while since I have reviewed anything on Yelp but I am just so happy with my meal today I had to let everyone know. 

I would normally tell you what to get but everything is honestly good.  I love the pizza, pancakes, waffles, biscuits and gravy, burgers, wraps, sandwiches, macaroni and cheese, muffins, cookies etc... And yes, it is all gluten free!!!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome!! Great food that is great for you and everything is gluten free. I got the salad (which was fantastic), my daughter had the pizza that she loved and we got a smoothly which was so healthy and delicious. The crowning moment was the gf banana bread with Nutella...omg this filled the void that reg banana bread has left behind. I'm so excited to have found a place that I can get treats without cheating :)"}
{"text":"Awesome concept, great service, and their PROTEIN cheesecakes are to die for! Kenny is the best"}
{"text":"Great Grubbing is a God Send. Being Gluten Free is getting easier nowadays but can still be a Struggle and I am happy to know I am safe to eat at Great Grubbing. Everything I have tried here has been A1 but my guilty pleasure is their Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Cookies. All of the Employees are so sweet and helpful. Great Location. 5 Stars!"}
{"text":"Okay so first thing, my vegan burger was outta this world! I added all the veggies and vegan mayo. I was a little disappointed that they didn't have wheat bread but it's all good! So basically I ordered to go and well they forgot to give me my fries which was a bummer but I'm not sure what oil they use for cooking them in so maybe it's animal based and well I'm vegan so maybe that's why they skipped the fries? All in all great place to grab a burger and the quality of the veggies are outstanding!"}
{"text":"Just had the most amazing food here! Best vegan gluten free burger in Vegas. We also ordered the protein waffles- bomb- fresh made to order juice, bulletproof iced coffee with vegan protein powder, and got chicken and a beef bone broth to go. You can tell this restaurant really puts a lot of care into the food they are serving. Not just a vegan gluten free restaurant- there is a huge delicious menu here!"}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful Pumpkin Waffle this am!  I love the salads and sandwiches here.  Everything is fresh and made on on site!  If you haven't been here  you should.  The environment is outstanding and the staff is extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Got lucky in Vegas and found a treasure!! Had a breakfast sandwich and a smoothie, and both were quite tasty.  Found out it was healthy for me too. This will be a definite must stop every time I come into town."}
{"text":"Super short: Best gluten free bread I've ever had! Best gluten free bread ever really! Sandwich was great, Coffee was ok, but very tasty overall. Comfy little space with a youthful vibe about it."}
{"text":"Disgusting. Janky overpriced food and smoothies. Rude lady who was condescending. Cheesecake tasted like a** mixed with protein powder. Cookie was as hard as a brick. Smoothies were lackluster. I have no idea how this place has good reviews. Go to one of the many other health food places that know how to make things taste good and who have good customer service."}
{"text":"Finally, a bakery that makes healthy, gluten-free muffins that honestly taste good!  My favorite was the Sweet Potato Pumpkin. Tastes just like pumpkin pie in a muffin. There was also a good selection of other low fat, gluten free and vegan products such as cheese cakes, cookies, and nut butters with healthy, amazing ingredients.  The staff was super nice and gave us several free samples."}
{"text":"We went to this place a few weeks ago and had a great experience! I had the vegetarian protein wrap which was good and the service was great! There were two guys working that day.
We went back again today on May 12 and I asked to place an order to go.
I was told by the lady at the counter that they stopped serving food at 2:30. It was exactly 2:34 because I looked at my phone.
So, be warned...even though they close at 3:00pm on Saturday, don't expect to get any food if you arrive past 2:30pm.
Business must be going great for them if they are turning down customers."}
{"text":"What a fun discovery! It's a small place with four small tables and a bakery/ counter/ display case.  they have been in business less than a year and the co-owner was telling us (the patrons) about recent additions to the menu, namely organic coffee.

i had an awesome vegan (ish) gluten free pizza with vegan cheese, real pepperoni , tomatoes, banana peppers, and more.  I filled my belly and shared some with other patrons.  

It's a sharing kind of environment.  the owner brought out a smoothie to whomever wanted it.  inspired by it, I bought a vegan chocolate smoothie with some bonus fixings free from the yelp check in coupon .  it was so good! 

i WILL be back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great smoothies and customer service!! The cookies and cream cheesecake was healthy and tasted good! Definitely would recommend going for a healthy smoothie"}
{"text":"Im not a gluten free vegan person. However the food here is awesome and tastes fantastic. Pizza, chinese food, smoothies, coffee drink, cakes, pies, all kinds of food. The smoothies have no added sugar concentrates and are very good. Everything is packed with protien! Best healthy food ive ever had. Give them a chance."}
{"text":"This place waa very trendy and they had a vegan menu! I would defiantly visit again. Fast service, great food, friendly staff!"}
{"text":"The food was phenomenal, the service was even better! Kenny the owner was helpful with all the menu options and great with recommending things. He talked with everyone that came in, the restaurant was clean and well kept. Loved the fish tank and seating area towards the back. So many options to choose from, and the Coffee was amazing! I had the biscuits and gravy for breakfast. The biscuit was huge, and so much flavor! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"New restaurant alert! Well new for me at least! Great Grubbing! FYI: NEW location! In the Atrium strip mall area, right where St Rose Pkwy and Paseo Verde meet. Perfect location for all the gym junkies. I zip thru this parking lot all the time as a shortcut to Serene Ave to get from one gym to another. It cuts commute time down 10 minutes..seriously! And now that GG is located here, it's really convenient to get my pre/post/refuel workout grub on!

Pink Dragon Smoothie is my preferred choice for smoothie. Made with dragonfruit, watermelon,  pineapple, and whey powder. I add MCT oil for my extra shot and boost for energy. Delicious, sweet, healthy! Gets me through in between meals. There's one other smoothie I want to try, but I'm so hooked on this one, so much so that I walk in and the staff knows my smoothie order..ha!

The gluten free grain bread they use for the sandwiches taste great! The texture though is delicate and bread falls apart easily but still I'm hooked on the grains they used for this bread! When making your choice of breads, try it!  

Muffins -  Blueberry Lemon - Lemon Blueberry Poppyseed ones are really good. The chocolate one I tried,not my favorite, needs more chocolate, like maybe chocolate chips? :D 

Breakfast items- Build you own omelette is what I had so far.  It's good and filling!

Portion and prices are pretty reasonable I think.  I paid just as much for a smoothie and sandwich when Presto Cafe was down the street.  

Other pluses, they open early am, the friendly staff, chill vibe,  love the panda theme, family friendly too.  Kenny the owner is so thoughtful to set aside a little area for the kids and parents to hang out with Kung Fu Panda playing the tv.  Oh and most importantly Great Grubbing's focus on gluten free foods! I have mild sensitivity to gluten, so I try to get GF choices as much as possible lately. Thanks to  Chef Tami over at CraftKitchen who recommended this place for me. Great Grubbing works out great!!!"}
{"text":"If you want an awesome smoothie or meal but have to go vegan for it, this is the place. Had an awesome chocolate chip cookie, made with pumpkin and it was great  and no having to run laps in the parking lot afterwards because it was healthy for me. Win win !"}
{"text":"WORST OWNER EXPERIENCE EVER!!! KENNY IS A JERK!!! Called to ask him why, two days in a row, we had what I thought were bad experiences. Immediately, he starts screaming at me trying to justify his EXTREMELY HIGH PRICES and the fact that the bread that he puts his sandwiches on, should be served at a tea party, they are soooo tiny!! The guy will be out of business in a year GUARANTEED!!! Bye-Bye!!!"}
{"text":"I created my own bomb ass pizza!!! Sweet and sour sauce, with cashew chicken and veggies! 
This is what I'm talking about!"}
{"text":"Four stars? For a smoothie joint?! Yes- having the nutrition info for each smoothie drink on a sticker to put on each order, complete with ingredients and calorie count, is gold. I wish more small businesses (particularly those geared toward healthy choices) provided their nutritional information.

I don't understand the pandas everywhere, but Great Grubbing has a good variety of smoothie and coffee drinks, plus a case of desserts and snacks (the muffins are a hit), and even premade meals for the nearby LVAC crowd, again, with a nutrition label with calorie count available.

Service was super friendly and happily recommended the Caribbean Green smoothie despite my initial urge to chose the Pumpkin Pie version. Location is clean, with a black and green theme, and plenty of local business cards and ads- the community vibe is strong here!"}
{"text":"My husband is sensitive to gluten. So lucky we found this place. The food and service are awesome!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great vegan options. The food is food. The cookies are freakin next level gewd. Nolan is the king of customer service. I asked for more teriyaki sauce for my tofu rice bowl and he happily gave me a larger portion then it had come with in the first place, then he gave us 3 huge vegan cookies that changed my life. The place is super cute and comfortable to hang out in. I give it 5 stars for the overall experience"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a celebratory breakfast after signing some paperwork on a new house across the street. I love vegan food and they had some good relatively \"normal\" food for my partner. Everything was just not good from the start. The guy behind the counter seemed hell-bent on detailing the ingredients of every. single. item. on the menu. It actually took us longer to decide because he would not stop talking. 

We waited for our order... and waited. It definitely was not worth the wait. I asked if I could have just regular iced coffee with whole milk and plain syrup. He assured me I could. What I got was an oversized cappuccino mug with watered down,  unsweetened coffee with almond milk and no actual ice. Gross.

I was excited for the vegan biscuits and gravy, but no. Just no. I guess technically it was biscuits with a \"gravy\" on top, but the taste was super weird and was completely overpowered by tumeric. I would much rather have a rich mushroom gravy to satisfy the craving. Whatever that was is an abomination.

If an insufferable hipster with handlebar mustache, a bookcase full of homeopathic self-help books and a \"gluten intolerance\" were a restaurant, this would be it.

Avoid."}
{"text":"Walked in to a nice, fun home feeling vibe. People are friendly & everyones presence is known as soon as you walk in the door. My favorite smoothie is the dragon fruit one, its a vibrant purpulish pink color! When i need to wake up i order their iced coffees, super refreshing and tasty. Their healthy pastries are the best iv'e ever tasted. Protein muffins come in a variety of flavors, my favorite is the Nutty Monkey & Sweet potato muffins. They also have protein cheese cakes that one can enjoy without guilt! They also sell nut butter which i have not tried yet but i'm very anxious to because iv'e heard great things about them. Prices are very reasonable too. My sweet tooth cravings are fixed here and all in a healthy and clean way, how can this place get any better?"}
{"text":"Love this place and the team that works there.  I'm attempting to get back on the eating healthy kick and this place definitely makes it easier and more affordable.  I had the pizza this afternoon and it was very tasty.  You must also try there shakes as they are all very very good.  Ask for Kenny when your in there and he will guide you thru the menu."}
{"text":"I am so glad I discovered this place.  I have been eating food that tastes like cardboard for months now because I was put on a soy, dairy, gluten and sugar free diet.  It was virtually impossible to find anything that resembled real food from an establishment that was dedicated to their 100% Gluten Free guarantee.  The staff is very kind.  They answered all my questions and when they didn't have the answers they went to get the product labels for me to look at.  Kenny was very personable and dedicated to accommodating his customers.  All the foods is prepared at his place in his gluten free environment and can be tailored to your dietary needs.  His homemade buns are the closest thing to real tasting bread that I have ever tried.  I ordered a dozen to keep at my house.  Overall, I say if you have any food allergies this is the place for you.  And the price was very reasonable.   I frequented the Great Grubbing twice this weekend after discovering it.  Thanks, Kenny"}
{"text":"This is literally my favorite spot . Not only is the food amazing, but Kenny the owner is so accommodating. The protein waffles are a daily craving of mine . I'd post a pic if I could contain myself from inhaling them. I'm full all day from them and I have a black hole of a stomach. I highly recommend you try this place."}
{"text":"Not coming back. :( I give two stars for the fact they offer vegan options. The staff was nice. Our biscuit and gravy bowls (hubby had regular, I had vegan) were so dry. If they didn't have enough gravy, it would have been nice to let us know there is only enough for a half order. So we basically paid 2x the price only to be left with this super dry biscuit-like bread. Spent nearly $20 and we are both still hungry. I'm sure the smoothies are great. I prefer not leaving negative reviews but I'm so disappointed. I either want a refund or a free smoothie to make up for the experience. You'll see the photo of mine in the gallery (Tofu biscuits and gravy) and know what I'm talking about. I would be more satisfied with a smaller order because we have all this extra bread with no flavor or gravy / toppings left. I'm such a vegan foodie so this was a major bummer. I do give them mad props for being 100% gluten free though."}
{"text":"The other day I stopped by to get a smoothie and was amazed at the professional and friendly service provided. My smoothie was excellent and I recommend everyone should try the pink dragon. If Nolan is there you know you are getting a good smoothie. I will be back again!!"}
{"text":"Delicious mocha! I love this place, they have great coffee and really good smoothies. I am always looking for organic restaurants that aren't a chain business and this place is really nice. The owner is super friendly and very welcoming. I highly recommend this for the health conscious las Vegan."}
{"text":"Always awesome. Food is super fresh, healthy, and completley customizable to fit your needs, diet, etc. They even have in house bakery, and full array of cbd products, creams, and foods.
Hands down best salads around...
Kenny, Nolan and his team are great. Definitely give this place a try, and you will be hooked...Whether it be breakfast ,lunch or snack time, the Menu is fantastic...I love the Dragon Fire coffees w protein, mct oil and grass fed butter. The smoothies rock also.
Great Grunbbin is a hidden Henderson gem u must try."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast after seeing a sign on the back of their building a couple weeks ago advertising a gluten free menu. Small cafe type of setting with a full menu. I took my four year old twins who were diagnosed with celiacs six months ago and they LOVED the food. I haven't really taken them out to eat much due to cross-contamination concerns, but this place doesn't even bring gluten into the building. We tried several things from the menu ranging from $3-$9. Everything was really good. I even purchased some of their house-made teriyaki sauce to take home with me and use for dinner tonight. Very thankful to find this place. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Dear Great Grub,

I would give you 100 stars and the moon if Yelp let me.  
Hands down the most delicious gluten free, healthy eating in Vegas. They also have tasty vegan dishes on the menu. I'm not vegan or gluten free person. I simply eat healthy. I dot always like to cook so finding a spot to eat that serves their food on point makes my life easier and happy. I'm really picky eater, however, there wasn't a thing I wanted to modify. It me my kind of spot. The owner himself cooks everything. He's super personable and knowledgable of healthy cooking. I seriously could not be any happier. 
P.S. A little bonus for myself... I found an awesome book on their bookshelf that I read while eating. Then order a copy of The Young Skin Diet by Michelle Lee!"}
{"text":"Kenny at Great grubbing is the best! I have tons of food allergies and he has been helpful when I come in to choose items that are safe for me. He is a genius with gluten free and Vegas! I also love that he adds protein to everything. The new spot looks amazing so go check it out if you haven't yet!!!!"}
{"text":"I found this place on Yelp when searching for GF and I'm so glad I did! The kids enjoyed a juicy burger in a gluten free bun. I had a delicious gluten free pizza with chicken and spinach and MT husband really enjoyed his burger. I was thrilled to see they carry my favorite brand of Kombucha (in a blue bottle). My kids can't do dAiry and they loved their smoothies made with almond milk. Even the baby loved green smoothie my husband got. You can't seem to go wrong with anything you order here!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My neighbor had a cake made from them for the 4th of July. It was the blueberry lemon poppy seed protein cake with fat free cream cheese frosting..... Wow! I asked where they got it and sent me here and told me to ask for Kenny. 
Me and Nathalie came here to check it out what a great place. We met with Kenny the owner and he's really into the food. His passion is really making the food great and healthy. 
The biscuits and gravy is a classic that he's transformed into his own. It's full of flavor and just so good. All of their pancakes are so good. 
If I could give him 10 stars I would!!"}
{"text":"1st Time here and the service is excellent!! Best I've had in years! Really genuine and so many healthy options. Everything is made from scratch and how you like it"}
{"text":"My fav place in Henderson! Imagine that you can have all ur cravings in a gluten free/ healthy and so welcoming environment! 
The place is suuper cool, unique and creative, it has graffiti, fish tank and its super clean. 
Coffee, smoothies, pizza, sandwich, waffles, everything that you want and not feeling guilty about it. 
Kenny,the owner is always there to make sure u happy with the food :) and the prices are cheap for the top ingredients they use. Watch what u put in ur body for the summer body :)"}
{"text":"Finally! A healthy place that tastes great and offers many items for people with dietary restrictions! I love to come in and get the custom smoothies. The owner and the staff are very friendly! The owner has donated a banner for the Agassi Prep Cross-Country team serving low-income athletes! The rummage sale will be ONE day only, June 13 from 8am-noon. There will be only high end and quality items. Name brand clothes, furniture, purses, women's men's, children's clothing, like new luggage sets, like new queen size mattress and furniture set, and food and drinks! Come support! Thanks again, Great Grubbing for supporting the Las Vegas community!"}
{"text":"I really dig this place! Clean, great food, they do different nut butters and the menu is simple and multiple choice, you build your own. Not overwhelming at all and they use great quality cold cuts for the sandwiches with no hormones and all natural. The pizza was rest on gluten free crust and thin, sauce was tasty. They have free cucumber water and the vibe is great! Nice energy! I would definitely  go back and try some more things. They also give you a 10% LVAC discount. Restrooms need a key but they are clean. Good job, great grubbing!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It's an easy 20 minute drive from the Las Vegas strip- my boyfriend and I actually visited twice during our week long vacation because it was so great the first time! Wonderful menu options, great customer service and very accommodating to my gluten and dairy allergies. It took the stress and worry out of eating in an new city. My boyfriend is a tough food critic and he couldn't even tell the bread and pizza he was eating was gluten free. I would give this place six stars if I could!  :)"}
{"text":"What can I say when it comes to homemade gluten free and vegan this place rocks 
The food is fresh and the try the smoothies they are great.
My favorite is the bbq grubbin burger which comes with a side salad..

Prices are good also thanks for an amazing lunch"}
{"text":"Who knew vegan could taste like the real deal haha

I've always wanted to try this place and I finally went with my brothers. I got the vegan biscuits and gravy, iced Americans, and a matcha doughnut. The biscuits and gravy were amazing! The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is very urban and laid back. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. It's on my way to work and I enjoy stopping here and grabbing a bulletproof coffee and a healthy smoothie."}
{"text":"Went to great grubbing for the first time and got a pizza and a smoothie it was a pink dragon was so good. I came back the next day to try there famous bullet proof coffee which was incredible. 5 stars on the service and the food."}
{"text":"This restaurant's concept is awesome. That being said I would recommend everyone to try this once. I had an enjoyable experience, however, I don't know if I would go back again because all of the options are overpriced. 

The menu is very healthy and has a lot of friendly options for all pallets. It is a bit confusing to order if it is your first time. 

I got a gluten free pizza and a smoothie. The was a decent dish but very overpriced. The smoothie was delicious and if I do return would just get a drink to go!

The restaurant was very hot inside and slightly humid. Not sure why or how but I was a little uncomfortable for dining in customers. 

The staff was pretty friendly. However, you really only see them when you order and when they bring out your food. 

It was definitely an experience I would suggest trying."}
{"text":"Finally I found a quick, fresh, health, tasty alternative to eating out when I'm here in Henderson on business.  Friendly staff, cool decor that reminds me of Berkeley. 

I found my spot. I usually gain unwanted weight while on the road. No longer.  I grinned the Kung Pao chicken bowl yesterday. Today I had the salmon burger. Oh...and can't forget about the bomb Dragon Coffee. P.S. I never write reviews. Stoked on this place. Love the little (non commercial) mentality vibe."}
{"text":"Probably the WORST PLACE out there.  Staff was clueless... Owner was to busy flirting with a gal instead of making my husbands smoothie (btw was horrible).  Their idea of a chopped salad was soggy iceberg lettuce, thinly(putting it nicely) sliced tomato, brown (not for a good healthy reason) egg and that is it, no other ingredients all for $9.99. Their excuse for an omelette is on par with everything else.   HUGE WASTE OF $26.00 ALONG WITH WASTE OF TIME.

       DONT GO!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm bumping my rating from 4 to 5 stars I have been here on multiple occasions and I feel GG deserves 5. They have added more menu items and the desert case keeps growing. 

As you would expect for 5 stars, everything is fresh, it is always clean and comfortable and the service is impeccable. If you're looking for gluten free in Henderson this is your place."}
{"text":"The staff is soooo friendly and they have nutrion facts for ALL their food, plus everything is gluten free  I've had their smoothies & protein muffins and enjoy both of them. I would love if their menu expanded to be more \"restaurant\" like, because it's more cafe or deli type menu items. Prices are very reasonable and appropriate for what you get. The owner Kenny is so thoughtful & happy, and their staff is always friendly. I really want to see this local business thrive and grow :)"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! I recently went Vegan and it's nice to go get a great meal and not have to cook it myself.  Kenny, the owner, has be incredible helping me try Vegan options. Today I tried Vegan Sliders with Hummus and it was delicious.  The Vegan Burger is great as well.  And the dessert options...to die for."}
{"text":"Great Grubbing was a HUGE LET DOWN!!  I had heard good things about it and being a health conscious eater, I was hoping it would be similar to protein house or greens and protein.  They had some options of low calorie, artificially sweetened cheesecakes and pastries that were decent.  I ate one while waiting on my food and had high hopes. 

 I ordered some form of chicken bowl and was extremely disappointed.  They used deli meat!! This is supposed to be a health conscious restaurant and the food was so bad I actually threw it in the trash before heading to another spot to get food.  It didn't only taste bad but they couldn't even cook real meat and use that. 

I will not be returning here."}
{"text":"So... We went again last night and here's a quick update.... 

The service: the sweet little platinum blond was working again. She remembered I was vegan and was so excited to show us a full case of protein filled, gluten-free, vegan and non vegan items. She made suggestions and was very patient with me when I built my own smoothie. 5/5

The product: Our smoothies were amazing. I made one up. It was so delicious. It was chocolate almond milk, vegan coffee protein, banana, some oats, and unsweetened coconut. Delicious! My boyfriend got the chocolate raz smoothie and said it was Great! We both finished them before we got home! We haven't gotten to try the tart yet but it really looks promising. There was a chocolate vegan whoopie pie that I really want to try next time. 

The owner was such a nice man. Excited about his product and full of useful info. They will have dragon fruit next week. We will definitely be stopping in for that. We also want to try the bullet proof coffee. Maybe before a work out we will stop by for an energy boost! We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I hadn't heard of this place before googling new lunch spots and I wasn't disappointed! Being vegan and gluten free I'm always on the hunt for new healthy locations, and when this location came up I thought I'd give it a shot! When I arrived the staff was very friendly. I had ordered a smoothie but wasn't aware it came with protein, I thought it was optional. Additionally, they automatically add their whey protein if you don't specify no protein or vegan protein. The only suggestion I have is advising customers about that and letting them know they can op for no protein or vegan protein. When I received my smoothie I thought it looked creamier than it should for being just ice, strawberries and lemons, so I got up and asked the girl behind the counter what was in it and she had said lemons and strawberries, and I asked about anything else because it didn't look like just lemons and strawberries, and she said they added whey protein powder to it. I'm very intolerant to lactose and whey and told her, and they remade my drink in a heartbeat! I didn't mean to be a pain in the butt, but I was so appreciative that they had no issue with remaking it! The second smoothie was okay but not worth the $7 I paid for it (too much ice). I went up and purchased a vegan/gf peanut butter chocolate chip cookie and it was hands down the best cookie I've EVER had, including back when I wasn't vegan and could tolerate wheat. While my friend and I were leaving a gentleman (who I'm assuming was the owner) gave us free samples of a veggie burger they were trying out (turmeric, rice, black beans, sweet potatoes, spices, etc) AND IT WAS SO GOOD!!! I went home and ate it right away. Definitely would recommend this place and will be going back, they had such a great menu selection and I'm now constantly craving those cookies"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! I've been coming here for years...since their old location on Eastern. I usually get my smoothies from here and there sooooo amazing!!!! My favorites are Pink Dragon... Killer Green or Caribbean Green.  Their vegan cookies are to die for as well! I just ate their pumpkin chocolate chip cookie...omg!!"}
{"text":"I was happy to see a restaurant that has all of my necessary \"frees\"...gluten free, soy free and the like. This spot boasts that it makes all of its gluten free breads, muffins and dessert items in house. But I was thrown off when the person who claims to make the hamburger buns/biscuits could hardly remember the ingredients he uses.....suspect of that. But I was hungry and my hopes were so so high. We had breakfast. I gave them all of my \"frees\" including sugar free and they assured me, they \"got this\"!  I ordered an omlette with biscuit and soy free vegan butter. My companion had the rice bowl with chicken. My food was good. So was hers. I was a little suspicious of the vegan butter so I didn't eat much of it. They were out of the hamburger buns in the to go case. So, I planned to go back at another time to get a pack. Our food was good. And the place has a really nice vibe for a quiet lunch or brunch in the middle of the week. When I went back a few days later, I saw the hambuger buns in the case. I could actually read the label from where I was standing....of course there was sugar in them amongst other things......I was very disappointed. I really wish places like this hired people who understood HOW important it is to KNOW what's in the food. And that someone is there at all times to articulate clear answers instead of guesses. And although sugar isn't quite like gluten for some, but its still very important to give accurate info."}
{"text":"I don't understand the ONE negative review... I haven't experienced the same treatment or deliciousness. :P 

The employees here are all unique individuals with lots of care and passion about where they work. They work hard to get out the items in a speedy manner without messing up an order. For being all in-house, you cannot expect a quicker order-- especially when they receive quick orders on the phone too! I'm always impressed with their timing. The over estimate time it will take and give big portions, considering they have so many gluten free and vegan options. The value here is worth it and that's not typical of gluten free restaurants in my experience.

I am Celiac so having a dedicated kitchen is one of the best things to find. I can eat almost everything on the menu, excluding the peanut items because those also bother my sensitive insides. I have tried at least one item from each section of the menu and my personal favorite is the sausage(not vegan) biscuits and gravy. The protein waffles look small but the protein added really helps them fill you up! I prefer adding blueberry and chocolate because I think it hides the protein flavor best. I also really enjoyed the sandwiches and pizza. The smoothies are GREAT! The amount of supplements you can add in is like that of a vitamin store! Ketones, k12, mct oil, turmeric/ginger or anything like it really...amazing and affordable! The bone broth with added veggies was 2 meals, easily. My partner likes the Coffee... and now they offer cbd for those of us with auto-immune diseases. They also offer GIANT cookies and take-home protein muffins that are so good! The offer cbd products and that's the only thing not made in house. Everything else is. If you expect that to be made in fast food time, try a fast food place. This is healthy food, served with service and people who remembered me after three months of not being there! I came in after my monthly obgyn and I'm not showing yet but the man asked how my baby is doing(pregnant). Thoughtful, well explained menu items for the conscious consumer that is willing to wait for quality AND quantity. So good. If it wasn't across town I'd eat here once a week!"}
{"text":"Smoothies here are amazing!! No juices or purées just fruits and veggies... Great price 20 oz for 5.99 and it comes with protein powder too.. Can't wait to go back!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just terrific.  Gluten free tuna wrap with microgreens was just right, and the cookies and protein muffins were great and priced very well.   Staff was friendly and very helpful.  Will be back!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The people were nice, but the food was mediocre.  My daughter in law was really excited for the acai bowl and she loved it.  I am really impressed with the fact that all of their breads are made on site.  Unfortunately, my omlete was over cooked or possibly cooked in the microwave.  I should have gone with my gut and got the pizza.  The other table selection were biscuits and gravy and fruit waffles.  The waffles featured the fruit mixed into the batter instead of on top as a garnishment which was kinda weird."}
{"text":"One of the most underrated spots in Vegas. I can't believe the stupid reviews on here. Someone complaining about the fish tank... we are here to review food and service (get a life buddy). 

This place is awesome. The owner, Kenny, always goes out of his way for his customers. His employees are amazing, they are never annoyed with my million of questions. If you want something specifically made they will most certainly attend to your needs.

People complaining about the price??? Really? Go to Cheesecake Factory and spend $9 on a piece of cheesecake. Go to Great Grubbing and you can have a slice to hanker your cravings for ~$4-5. Yes, it does not taste the same, but you're comparing 900 calories to 160 and it is full of protein.

The salads are roughly ~$7 and can be shared between two people! My boyfriend and I tend to go for a gf pizza and salad to share.

This place has one of the most passionate owners and employees to match!! 

I will add more photos, here is one of some necessities I need for my traveling adventure from Nevada to Montana."}
{"text":"Are you gluten intolerant ? Don't look any further ,this place basically open doors for people like you.

Great customer service and hands on ownership."}
{"text":"Food was nothing special.  Had egg dish, protein waffle and specialty coffee drink.  Nothing was an OMG.  Eggs were small portion and nothing exceptional.   Waffle was okay especially knowing it had protein.  I live coffee and their specialty drink tasted terrible, super sweet and not a good coffee drink for someone that likes good coffee."}
{"text":"Omg Great Grubbing has done it again! They finally serve grass-fed bone broth. I've looked all over for this magical cure to every ailment, skin, health, weight...etc and had finally resorted to ordering it online. Now all I have to do is pick it up at my favorite place in town. Thanks Kenny for making all my dreams come true haha"}
{"text":"Sweet potato muffins, smoothies, butters and cheesecakes are fantastic. Owner Kenny is great to talk to and really has put together a nice place."}
{"text":"I got sick right after eating here. I had the food tested and found out it wasn't gluten free. I also witnessed the owner/ cook use the restroom and not wash his hands. I was also double charged and didn't know until after I got home and checked my account online and when I called to complain the owner Mr. Knoll told me to never come back and he said for me to F off. I filed a bank dispute and will get my money back that way."}
{"text":"This place sucks. The espresso shots were weak and flavorless, and they messed up an espresso over ice (not enough ice, ended up watery and lukewarm). Also, the baked goods seems awful. I sampled a piece of Pumpkin Pie that was so dry that I had to spit it out. I wouldn't go back under any circumstances."}
{"text":"Man where do I start. Okay I love the salads here. They're always made super quick and are perfectly balanced between the greens and toppings. I love the custom order sheet, brilliant idea and hassle free ordering. The desserts are so good. I love the smoothies. Kenny is so warm and welcoming, I've never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"It's hard to find gluten free and vegan food and even harder to find a good tasting place! This place is really really good and reasonably priced for the quality you get! The Monster Pizza, The Club Sandwich, Dragon protein infused real juice smoothies, and pancakes with as many ingredients in them as you want, plus Bullet Proof Coffee??? It's an Oasis in Vegas/Henderson and a nice change from all the processed and fatty foods on the strip. Eat healthy, live longer, and find your inner Zen at Great Grubbin! Did I mention it really tastes good too? My kids loved this place! 13min from the strip."}
{"text":"Love this place and the fact that I work next door :) Friendly staff, and great food!"}
{"text":"I love Great Grubbing!   Kenny the owner is A plus!  He is always extremely friendly and accommodating.   If they don't have something you want just ask they will make it for you!  I visit at least 2x a month to stock up on the protein muffins!  I for one am so glad to have found Great Grubbing!"}
{"text":"Gluten free is so in right now! 

Besides those who have a serious allergy and or celiac disease and I am neither, everything we tried was flavorful and tasty. We tried the Amazon smoothie, the vegan cookie dough bites, vegan carrot apple muffins and chocolate mint muffins. I love that they don't add extra sugar to their smoothies and the label on the back tells you so! The protein muffins we had were moist and yummy while also being healthy. I always order them at Grouchy John's with my coffee in the mornings! The owner came out from behind the counter and chatted with us which made our experience more personal and enjoyable. I will be back to try their sandwiches, pizza and coffee. 

Also, they have pandas frolicking around, eating and enjoying life on the tv so bonus."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  The owner is super nice and the staff is cool too.  It's comfy inside with some couches and there's free wifi.  So far I have had a sandwich and waffles and both were quite good.  I like how the Rockstar Energy Drinks are cheaper than the gas station too."}
{"text":"Time and time again ive been trying to get my kids eat healthy especially with a 13 yr old son thats type 1 diabetic. So happy Great Grubbing opened up rigt by my house, now all my kids want are smoothies and the healthy snacks they offer all at a great price thats not going to hurt the wallet unlike most spots. The staff is friendly and knowledgable and can answer any and all questions you have regarding the menu and what sets the apart from the competition. Did I mention the pizzas!?!? Some of the best in town and gluten free!!!! Thanks Great Grubbing, youre a welcome addition to a town lacking in good, quality and healthy food for people with specific dietary needs! Youll continue to have my business now and in the future."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for a nice, healthy meal.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  It's also a good spot for a great smoothie.  The menu was put together by nutrition experts; a perfect post workout cafe."}
{"text":"Very good! All gluten free- no worries of cross contamination. I haven't had French toast in years, and theirs was amazing!!! Cute little spot"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME I love the enviroment the great customer service and these bad ass innovative ideas for tasty healthy grubbin, this place is indeed GREAT GRUBBING"}
{"text":"First timer here, and boy was I pleasantly surprised! I had the gluten free vegan pizza, with some turkey bacon, olives, onions, and tomato. (I know, not so vegan )The crust was nice and crispy as requested, and the flavors were almost identical to a regular gluten pizza with real cheese! The smoothie, tropical delight, was such a nice consistency and balance of flavors too. This place takes the time to make sure everything you ingest is of top quality, I feel the love! LOL. Even got an invite to try some new crazy coffee drink the next morning . This place is fantastic and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Don't drink the water!!! 

I went for bulletproof coffee but got inexperienced, rude customer service. I poured a cup of cucumber water and noticed brown stuff floating in the water. Looked at the spout saw the same brown stuff. I wiped it off the spout with a paper towel. I grabbed another cup and poured the cucumber water. This time it was more brown stuff, clumps floating in the cup. I brought it to the attention of the baristas. Instead of cleaning the spout and pouring out the water they blamed me... Saying it was probably already in the cups or that I pushed it into the spout. I didn't even want to try the coffee after that... I don't know what they're putting in that stuff. Needless to say, got a full refund."}
{"text":"Great Grubbing has an outstanding selection of 100% gluten free dishes plus lots of vegan options. I love their protein muffins...the Nutty Monkey is my favorite! 

Owner Kenny Knoll is super friendly and passionate about his business and his customers' satisfaction.  

I wish there were more dining options like Great Grubbing...highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"I came in starving & the owner I think it was, had a great list of vegan options. It appears they make everything from scratch & are detailed on the ingredients for people that watch what they're consuming. Every meal he described sounded amazing. 

The pictures of the vegan burger & pink dragon smoothie on yelp looked pretty good so I went with that. The burger came with a  nice green salad. 

While I was waiting, I was eyeing the vegan red velvet donut but I resisted my temptation on getting it. After all, I just finished working out. To my surprise, the food came out promptly. I was rather pleased with everything & how welcoming & friendly they were so I will certainly be back. I'm really intrigued to try out the other vegan things on the menu. Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Amazing! The service was great! The food, for being gluten free, wonderful! My dad has celiac disease and is very limited when it comes to dining out. What a great place for him! Every single thing on the menu is gluten free! Absolutely no limits for him! He was in heaven! The staff is friendly and super helpful. Thank you for making a menu that fits our needs and tastes great! I can eat all the gluten I want but I will definitely be going back for more!"}
{"text":"I actually didn't like my smoothie or the food at all.

Came here after a long night of partying, and needed something healthy to detox. So I opted for the green smoothie with kale, cucumber and a bunch of other veggies. When I see the word smoothie, I assume and expect something \"smooth\". Well, my smoothie was everything but smooth. I'm not sure if the blender was broken or what, the kale was still in rather large chucks and when I was drinking it, it was hard to swallow and I actually had to chew the kale like a salad. I also expected a large amount of veggies in my smoothie, but instead I got mostly the vanilla protein shake and the whole smoothie taste just that. For a small 20oz smoothie that didn't really taste good, it was $6.99, and the ice was still in chunks too, so I had to chew through that. 

My friend got the salmon burger with greens, he didn't like his either. So overall pretty disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"I usually come on this side of town for doctor appointments and at times we stop by Juice Standard but this time we saw the bright and capturing design outside this vegan venue. It was mine and my husband's first time here and I have to say I was impressed. I just found out I have many limitations for food since my recent health diagnosis and when I was told even the bread and wraps we're vegan and gluten & dairy free I was excited to try the food. I ordered the hummus and bean wrap and to splurge a gluten & dairy free pumpkin cookie. We had originally planned to take the food to go but as we walked further into the venue and saw a couple couches and great reading material. We changed our mind and decided to dine in. As the young man who took our order saw us sit he offered some water since we decided to stay. I can't wait to come back again to try some more items on the menu. Thanks for the great service."}
{"text":"It's a little pricey for sandwiches and salads but it's great to have more healthy takeout options around here. Service was really friendly. Super important. Gluten free pizza. Vegan pizza! Def no skimping on the Daiya on yesterday's pizza. So good. Today I ordered a regular GF pizza with chicken, pineapple, and coconut curry sauce (and I added Sriracha). BOMB. Probably time to step away from the pizzas for a couple days. Pizza Life."}
{"text":"I just checked out this place since I am fairly new to eaten gluten due to allergies. My chicken sandwich was phenomenal and they make their own bread in house. Kenny the owner was very friendly and you can tell he cares about his product. He even gave me a bag of sweet potato pumpkin muffins to try. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I am gluten sensitive so always have a hard time finding restaurants that are completely gluten free. I found this restaurant on \"find me gluten free\" and am so happy I did.  We were visiting from NC and had both breakfast and dinner there. We liked it so much we went back the next day.  The waffles and protein smoothies are the best gluten free ones I've ever had. The burgers and pizza were amazing!  The best part is the waitstaff, every person we encountered, including the owner, Kenny, was above and beyond friendly.  The owner even took time out of his busy day to talk with us sharing his experience with opening a totally gluten free restaurant, what a great story.! To find out more, I highly recommend you stop in and meet Kenny and try anything and everything you can. I almost forgot to mention their delicious desserts. They have a variety of scrumptious breads, (yes I said bread), protein muffins, vegan brownies, pumpkin cheesecake, and pumpkin chocolate chip cookies.  My only wish is that the restaurant was in North Carolina! Thank you Kenny for your tremendous hard work maintaining this 100% gluten free restaurant!"}
{"text":"The bulletproof coffee is to die for!! But as a mom with Celiac's and a son with Celiac's, it is so nice to be able to go to a place where you don't have to use a special menu.  You can order anything from the menu and know not only was it was prepared in a 100% dedicated Gluten-Free kitchen, but also that it will taste delicious.  They have kid's meals that are comparable in price to regular restaurants and also kid approved.  My kids constantly request food from Great Grubbing. I have yet to order something I haven't liked.  From the protein muffins and cheesecakes, to pizza, salads, spaghetti and Mac n cheese.  We love it all!!"}
{"text":"Best addtion to my neighborhood ever! Gluten free and vegan delicous smoothies. The owner guy is awesome. My favorite morning stop before work."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get a smoothie in Las Vegas. The Pink Dragon is my favorite. Lots of options for picky dieters."}
{"text":"Based on Yelp reviews I was like, \"Okay, don't expect great service but expect great food.\" The service was perfectly fine but the food.... This is where I'm conflicted about Yelp because is it fair for me to write this review after only one visit? Then again, life is short and money doesn't grow on trees so maybe one experience is very telling - why come back if it wasn't great? 

So, they were out of the biscuits and gravy which is 95% the reason I came but what was weird is that it was only 10:00 on a Sunday morning. Were they not going to make more any time soon...? I ended up getting a vegan waffle and acai bowl. My bf got an omelette. 

The waffle was not good at all. I'm sure people are excited and giving it good reviews because it's gluten free, vegan, and has protein in it but it just was not a good waffle. Getting that combo of things is possible and tricky but I could have done it at home so if I'm paying a place to make it for me, I expect it to be great. The waffle was really, really mushy and the flavor was lacking. I added coconut but couldn't tell that there was any in there.  And then the acai bowl...$8 for acai and granola? Most places include some bananas, berries, coconut or chia.  It wasn't smooth at all and was sort of just plopped into the bowl all messy looking with granola. I didn't even bother taking a picture. Obviously, this entire place is about eating nutrient dense and efficiently so I understand not dressing up food because food is fuel not for decoration but, damn, maybe take 2 seconds to shake the bowl and make it flat and presentable?  But again, it's the cost of $8 for a bowl of almost nothing. 

The omelette my bf got with veggies he said was good but didn't have anything. No garnish, no toast, no nothing? So yeah, again, I know it's not about being fancy but it was just kind of like...oh... We ended up spending $26 and I'm pretty bummed about that because it's a lot of money, it wasn't good food, and we don't eat out much so it was supposed to be a treat and it ended up being a huge fail.     Now, some of the other things look really good. I still want to try the biscuits and gravy and the pizza but Idk, it's pricey and I have a bad taste in my mouth after this experience."}
{"text":"Kenny Knoll is a genius when it comes to vegan bread! I loved every bite of my GG basic sandwich and bone broth with chicken. Pure perfection! Kenny is so friendly which welcomes you into this cool space of his! Even if you are not a vegan or vegetarian, the food is excellent!"}
{"text":"Incredible!! Just stopped in for the first time and wish I would've come here sooner! The staff and owner were super friendly and informative & pink dragon is bomb! (Better smoothie than g&p / ph)  And my baby bear loved the healthy cheesecake!"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite places! As someone who has celiac, I am always so happy to find a business that is all gluten free. However, this place really goes above and beyond. Their quality of food is always fresh and very tasty and the service could not be better. Also, the price is very reasonable considering you are getting quality, organic, gluten free ingredients. 

Today when I went the owner was working and he was having a conversation with another customer and telling him the story of how the restaurant started and his story was incredible. I love giving my business to a place I feel like the owners are regular people.. not to mention this guy was working his butt off. He wasn't acting like the 'owner' but rather helping in all aspects of the restaurant, which is a HUGE plus for me. 

Another small thing I noticed is the worker at the front gave a little counter decoration to a small child who was crying as her mom was checking out because she wanted the toy. Without hesitation the clerk handed the child the small toy. 

I know these seem like small things, but I really believe they are important and it is so nice to know there are still places that operate on this 'family' type business models. 

I would highly recommend this place for all reasons listed above, and I will be no doubt be back to this place every chance I have!"}
{"text":"Really good food! A lot of people may think Gluten Free, Organic or Vegan may lack flavor, but you are wrong! Do yourself, & your body, the favor of checking this place out!"}
{"text":"1 star. In my neighborhood. 
1 star. Locally owned bakery. 
1 star. Ultra friendly service. The owner was outside chatting with all the customers and made my kids feel super special by offering them free candies, chatting with them about pandas, and even taking their picture and saying he would hang it on the wall. 
1 star. The stuff is really good. I haven't tried any of the actual food yet, just the desserts, but I definitely enjoyed the pumpkin pie and the Oreo cheesecake. The cheesecake has a really rich flavor even though....
1 star. HEALTHY! They avoid flour and sweeteners when possible, and/or sub with stevia, almond flour, etc. cheesecake is only 150 calories a piece and a lot of that comes with the 19 g of protein! Yes they add protein powder to some of the desserts. It's enough to be my special treat substitute for my daily protein Shake. 
Welcome to the neighborhood, great grubbing! See you again soon!"}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the staff is super friendly.  this was my first time eating there and I was blown away.  I had the vegan wrap and my brother-in-law had the vegan waffles.  Delicious! They also have vegan chocolate chip cookies which by themselves are worth going for! Seriously! I also had a shake that was great, different and the best part is I felt great after eating everything. Score!  They have non-vegan food, but being a vegan I'm always looking for good spots to eat in Vegas when I visit -- and hands down this is one of the best discoveries. Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"Dragon Fire Coffee!!

Great Grubbing is great. I've been a fan of Great Grubbing since they opened the original location off Eastern Ave. They have since moved to this location and everything is still great.  This location is a lot greater with more seating. Kenny, the owner, is so cool and great.  And if he's not too busy, he'll chat it up with you with some great conversation. 

When it comes to Great Grubbing, I only come for one thing and that's their Dragon Fire Coffee.  The DFC is Great Grubbing's version of the \"bulletproof\" coffee.  GG makes their DFC with a bunch of options.  I'll have it with Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCT) and Ghee butter. For an additional $1.50, you can also add a scoop of Intek Protein powder. I find that the MCT helps me with my digestion, keeps me regular, and pumps me with energy without the crash.  MCT also helps me get fat-adapted, which is great if you're trying to make fats your main fuel source instead of glucose.  I can make my own \"bulletproof\" style coffee at home, but it's never ever as great as Great Grubbing's.  Great Grubbing's Dragon Fire Coffee is so smooth, frothy, and very tasty.  Bottom line, it's great.

Great Grubbing also has a great selection of food.  GG serves breakfast items, protein pancakes/waffles, burgers, pizzas, sandwiches, rice bowls, and baked goods.  Most of their dishes are created on the healthier side, Vegan friendly, and gluten-free.  Take my advice and give Great Grubbing a try.  Not only do they have great food, they have great coffee.  

2017 Great Yelp Review #74"}
{"text":"If I could rate this place with more stars I would. The customer service I experienced at my last visit really made me appreciate this place so much more. The waiters here are so kind and extremely accommodating. The food is amazing and they really care for their customers. I give this place an A+ rating. Lovely place to go grab a bite! Especially for vegans."}
{"text":"This little cafe is a Hidden Gem in Henderson. There gluten free pizza and other organic foods and baked goods are all amazing. I have a stomach disease which requires certain foods and this restaurant is one of the few that does not consistently upset my stomach. it is also fairly priced and most of the meals come and large portions. The staff are super nice and very helpful with any potential questions as well because there is some things I want to see don't recognize being an East Coaster. I highly recommend great grubbing especially if you require gluten free food but without sacrificing taste."}
{"text":"5 stars for the customer service, environment, and quality. It was my first time today. I ordered a pizza, pumpkin sweet potato muffins, coffee, and juice. Just felt like trying it all. A little pricey but so worth it. Super cute and comfy environment. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Got a egg white scramble and bullet proof coffee. All was delicious and service was great. Healthy food that actually tastes great is hard to find. I love how the staff helps so much with questions and sugestions. LOVE THIS GEM!"}
{"text":"Great place for both breakfast and lunch in my experiences! For breakfast I usually order a ham and swiss scramble which is a very generous serving and very satisfying. With that I get the bulletproof iced coffee with MCT oil (burns fat) and mocha flavored protein powder (acts as a sweetener and creamer). The coffee is unbelievable ! Super delicious and keeps me going all day without the jittery feel of normal coffee.

For lunch I get the chicken teriyaki stir-fry bowl with brown rice and broccoli and the choice of sauces is awesome, but I usually stick with traditional teriyaki. On occasion I also order my bowl with a fried egg on top which is a tasty twist that the owner Kenny introduced me to! 

There are so many great gluten free options and I can't wait to try more!! Before you leave don't forget to take a yummy GF dessert to-go! I've tried 3 of the cheesecakes and the pumpkin chocolate chip cookie and they're all to die for!

Just don't expect to stop for a quick lunch and go because everything here is prepared fresh and takes time so you may have to wait a bit, but I promise it's worth it ;) If you don't see exactly what you want or want to customize something to your liking, just talk to Kenny and he has exciting ways to jazz up your meal!"}
{"text":"Probably most excited to find this place so close to home for one simple reason; amazing food and drinks. The owner Kenny is intensely invested in preparing wholesome and healthy meals and drinks. Working with a nutritionist, he focuses on nutrient dense foods and often opting for organic and GMO free ingredients, he offers breakfast items such as omelettes and scrambles, pancakes and waffles, many vegan options, as well. For lunch and dinner, sandwiches, wraps, pizzas and rice bowls in loads of flavors and varieties. He also makes daily yummy treats such as peanut protein balls (amazing), \"healthier\" cheesecake, breads and muffins, and has organic bone broths available if you're needing an intense immune tonifying supplement. 
His iced (or hot) coffees are addicting, the Iced Dragon is brewed cold coffee, with your choice of whey or vegan protein in lots of flavors, and MCT oil added for energy and thermogenesis boost. He also has a nice smoothie menu, from fruity to green juice. 
Go by and check it out!"}
{"text":"I tried Great Grubbing with a friend immediately after yoga at Tru Fusion. 

First of all, the service of the chefs are incredible. They had some donuts out on the counter without any ingredients, but when I asked the register girl what the ingredients were and she went to the back to ask the chef came right out himself. Very kind! The register girl herself, though, seemed a bit new; she needs to familiarize herself better with the products. 

I ordered the Pink Dragon, a smoothie made up of Dragonfruit, watermelon, and pineapple. I was debating between this and the Sweet Potato/Pumpkin combination, but I never had dragon fruit before, so I decided to buy the Pink Dragon. End result: Delicious, beautiful, and fresh. The combination was not too-pineapply or watermelony; it was a perfect balance of fruit. 

The banana coconut cashew mini-muffin I bought (just to get something solid) was alright; very dry, in my opinion. *Beware, if you have never been here before, ALL of the muffins are mini.*

Next time I will definitely be back to try the Sweet Potato smoothie OR Sweet Potato Pumpkin Protein cheesecake! I look forward to it, and I will be back here to update my review. :)"}
{"text":"Good. The concept of this place is uplifting and the service is very accommodating and informative. They make almost EVERYTHING from scratch and in-house, in addition to sourcing local ingredients, but the product needs some culinary finesse to help the ingredients shine. The space is also really big and inviting. This trip, a smoothie and a sandwich was ordered. The smoothie was very good and every ingredient could be tasted. The sandwich revealed a couple kitchen mistakes. For the record, these guys are willing to pretty much make anything they have the ingredients for, as far as basic lunch sandwiches and salads go, so you're not limited to what's on the menu. I posted for one of their salads; a tuna salad made into a sandwich on house-made bread. The tuna salad is \"made to-order,\" so that allowed me to omit celery, BONUS. The mixture was a bit watery though, which means the tuna was not drained enough. Nice, white, albacore tuna but the water took away from tasting it. The rest of the tuna salad included plump dried cranberries, sunflower seeds, onion, and mayo. Very good but lacked seasoning, maybe a bit of S&P? The only issue with making something like tuna salad \"to order\" is that it doesn't have a chance to absorb seasonings or bring out flavors like it would after sitting. The sandwich had beautiful micro greens and was on homemade bread but the bread was definitely over-baked. It was extremely dry and also lacked seasoning. While it was a pretty sandwich (see photo), it possessed watery tuna salad and dry bread. If they tweak those two mistakes, it would turn out really good. The prices are affordable here and I love the healthy options and fresh preparation concept. Definitely a return visit in store and lots more menu items to try out!"}
{"text":"If you are Paleo, Vegan, have gluten sensitivity, or are just looking for a healthy, made from scratch meal, this spot is amazing.  With dietary limitations, I am accustomed to only finding a few items on the menu that will work for me. I love that I can have about anything on the menu, and the food is made from scratch with ingredients that I appreciate (i.e. the pancakes are made with vegan protein!). They have home made baked goods too; I recently shared their muffins with a group of people who don't have even have dietary restrictions and they loved them. The quality, taste, service, and selection is top notch."}
{"text":"I'm not too sure how I feel about this place yet. I decided to stop by for take out on my lunch. I walked in and I loved the atmosphere of the place, I loved the small intimate set up. There was a really nice lounge section by the window. I ordered a pressed juice, because I'm obsessed with juicing, and the half order of the biscuits and gravy. They have vegan options from sandwiches to salads, pizza, and deserts. Needless to say, I was excited to try it.  The juice I got was good, really flavorful. Unfortunately, the biscuits and gravy were a disappointment. It was so seasoned and peppered it was unbearable. I could not eat it. A co-worker said their food was good, and I don't want to loose hope on vegan cuisine. I will be trying it again and letting you guys know how it turns out."}
{"text":"The vegan wrap keeps me coming back not to mention the whole loaf of white bread! Best gluten free spot in vegas."}
{"text":"I read the reviews on here and got so excited to try this place.  I ordered a tropical delight smoothie and chicken with spinach gluten free pizza. Honestly, the pizza to me was very bland with the toppings. The crust and tomato sauce tasted better without it actually.  My smoothie was very creamy and not overly sweet. I also got a brownie and it tasted kinda dry. I'll come back for the smoothies and coffee but probably not the food.  I love the atmosphere of the place and it's cute pandas."}
{"text":"Friendly people. 
Good healthy food. 
I doesn't matter to me but everything is gluten free.  
Minus 1 star for being a tad bit pricey for my cheap ass"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch. The food is good but the menu is overwhelming and they take forever to get the food ready. I chose this place because I love pandas. If you love pandas this is a good place to go."}
{"text":"I love this place! 
I don't have gluten allergies but I really love their GF protein cookies, the sandwiches, and i am hooked on their coffee. Their iced coffee doesn't get me all jittery like all the other coffees out there.
Its made with low acidic organic coffee, alkaline water, and instead of sugary flavored syrups/creams/milk - they use protein powder instead. They also add mct oil or coconut oil.
There is also a vegan protein powder option as well, with a variety of flavors. My personal favorite is the mocha  it gives me the boost of energy I need to get my day started and keeps me nice and full, definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!! It's healthy food that tastes as good as it should! Very fun and creative flavor combinations, well worth the trip. :)"}
{"text":"Cute spot with great customer service and even yummier food! Love their drinks and salads"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 

I had a dragon fruit, pineapple smoothie and it was tasty, but had a little funky after taste. 

Also, tried the vegan truffles: the choco, cashew, goji berry ones were really good! 

I would de finely go back again to try a different smoothie and grab a few more truffles."}
{"text":"I was initially pretty scared when I decided to cut out gluten and high sugar from my diet. I say that like I had a choice. High fats (and HGCS) are also out. :( and I live in Las Vegas. It's not the \"we have restaurants for all diets\" kind of environments that existed in San Francisco and New York. And, of course, all this happens right after I've moved away from New York. 

So enter gluten-free, low sugar, low fat BS that is apparently going to keep me healthy. I want none of it, but like I said, not really much of a choice.

Thank god for this place. Great Grubbin had a lot of high ratings, so I read all the bad ones on Yelp first, because I wanted to know what the worst case scenario would be. A lot of people complained about bland, or sugary, or no bananas: you people really should read the menu. Sugar? Well, they're natural, so unless you're low-sugar, you'll have no problem, and in cases like mine, that accounts for maybe 5 items. No bananas on your waffle? You're right, they're baked into the waffle. Bland? Well, someone must have busted up your taste buds with a car battery because girl, I'm here to tell you there was nothing bland about Kenny's Dragon Eggwhite Roast Beef Everything but the Panda Sandwich on brown grain gluten free in-house made bread. That was so tasty, while the juices were running down my fingers, all I could focus on was how good it was and how relieved I was to find a sandwich shop with a great sandwich!

That's right. I love sandwich shops, especially the ones in San Francisco (sorry nyc, you guys think you know sandwiches because you invented the pastrami sandwich or something, and maybe you did, but SF perfected if), and this one stands up to Petite Deli and Ike's and says \"hey sandwich shops, I'm gluten free, so stick that in your taste buds and 

BOOOM!\"

Yes. It's that good. And the cheesecake lasted about a second on the table before my husband and I scarfed it down. He makes the one we had with banana and the slight hint of it, which I thought would have been off putting actually put it over into the category of awesome healthy desserts (this slice has 20g Protein, 2g fat and 9g of sugar). That's pretty freaking awesome for something that tasted that good. 

Looks like this place will be a common stop on the way home from work or on the weekends. Extra props for the owner Kenny being such a nice guy. He's really excited about the concept and coming up with new recipes for his menu and that just means he'll keep making amazing new things all the time!

Luke's Law: it should be illegal for gluten-free food to taste this good. But dagnabbit! This Grubbin gets to slide by on the pure genius of it all."}
{"text":"Here are the things i love about Great Grubbing: Literally, everything.

This place rocks.  If you're a calorie nazi like me, this place will check all your boxes and make your macro tracking a breeze. Everything (and I mean everything) they sell has a nutrition label with calories and macros. See that piece of protein cheesecake? (Yes, I said protein cheesecake. You're welcome.) It has like 13g of protein and less than 160 calories. WHAT?!?!

Awesome smoothies, creative healthy snacks, protein muffins and protein cheesecakes, and all kinds of gluten free goodness.  The protein muffins are great - the banana ones specifically.

I also had a delicious smoothie...can't remember the name, but I know it was green and it was super yummy! 

They're located right by TruFusion, so instead of getting one of their juices or smoothies, head over to Great Grubbing instead!"}
{"text":"I got the bowls and they put them in the microwave. Later they showed us how to leave a tip   It was like having left overs and I think I make better left overs at home. Everything on the menu is create your own sandwich, pizza, or bowl. Not the most creative. On top of that, it's located between the loan shop and a cigar/tattoo shop. I wouldn't have come if the yelp reviews weren't so high. I wish someone could have recommended something better but when I asked they said everything was good. F+. The plus is because they were nice."}
{"text":"This place has a variety of options that are absolutely delicious. I'm a Vegetarian and I love when I find places that offer creative options outside of the lackluster salad. Their Vegan Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Cookie is to die for. Today I hit a little snag with my bite squad order, I called the manager and he was so sweet. He remade my order and threw in my favorite cookie. He even offered a gift card, but I was fine with a cookie.  Yesterday when I went to pick up my lunch one of the staff members offered to warm up my cookie because he said is tasted even better warm. He was right it was quite tasty warm. The level of service is impressive. The cafe is quaint and has a really chill coffeeshop type vibe. This place is perfect for a quick lunch or a dragonfruit smoothie on a hot day"}
{"text":"Honestly, the only reason to go there is if you can't eat gluten. At least you're sure to be safe. And this is not easy in Vegas. 

My wife had a rice bowl. The rice itself is a pure shame. Not tasty, not correctly cooked. It is simply mixed with some carrots and sliced chicken (kindda what you can find for almost nothing at 7/11)

I took a gluten free pizza. The crust is ok, considering it is gluten free. Cheese are ok. Meat is very low quality again. 

Service is in average. 

I don't understand the general rating. Doesn't make any sense."}
{"text":"Wow!  I love this place!  I was in the area looking for coffee and was happy to find Great Grubbing open. I'm vegan and they had more than enough options to choose from. Additionally they have items catering to other dietary needs. Kenny, the owner, was kind enough to chat with me about the menu and selections they're working on. I was beyond impressed and can't wait to go back!  I've included a pic of their HALF size vegan biscuits and gravy....yummy!"}
{"text":"Had the amazon smoothie and um yaaas very good! The owner is such a super cool guy and took the time to interact with us which made the experience all that better. Didn't get food but the prices were well priced, the breakfast sandwiches looked big!"}
{"text":"This stuff is amazing!!! Protein packed, no oil. No butter or shortening! Best of all it tasted amazing. It's so nice to see a company take pride in their ingredients. Everyone must try this!!!!!"}
{"text":"I like this little place it's my first time... Totally impressed with the menu, fully gluten free and vegan options as well... Egg white sandwich is yummy and the bread actually tastes good! I Definetly will return maybe tomorrow and try out the pizza!"}
{"text":"I honestly can't say enough at this place. This is the only place in town that I can truly feel comfortable with what I'm ordering and not have to fear that there is something in my food that I can't eat. The food is delicious front he pancakes to the pizza and the staff is wonderful! Everyone is here to help and care, something very hard to find in our city. The owner is wonderful as well and takes the time to truly get to know his customers. Tip: whatever you do, do not leave without one of the pumpkin cookies. You'll thank me later. :)"}
{"text":"This place a wonderful variety of healthy food and drinks. Their Dragon Fire Cold Brew coffee was delicious. The staff was extremely friendly and the store is always clean."}
{"text":"I live in Los Angeles but was looking for a cool vegan spot to dine at for something fresh and healthy! I was pleasantly surprised to find Great Grubbing on Yelp. This is such a cute spot where the employees are incredibly sweet and the food is as fresh as could be! I ended up ordering a veggie sandwich on their gluten free bread. Believe me when I say that this was the best gluten free bread that I have ever tasted! They make it FRESH in house and offer a few flavors and the opportunity to take your very own loaf home (which I gladly would have done if I were headed home that day). The veggie sandwich was full of incredibly crisp and fresh veggies which actually offered relief from the intense heat outside. Paired with one of their signature smoothies, and you have a desert survival match made in heaven! The next time I am in Vegas I will be sure to venture away from the strip to grab some of the fresh and tasty eats from Great Grubbing!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Great Grubbing to try their vegan waffles. I got two vegan waffles to go. My first waffle was ok, but the second was a disappointment. It wasn't until I got home that I noticed how \"crisp\" the waffle was. Based on the one waffle that was edible, the flavor of the waffle wasn't pleasing at all. It tasted like what I imagine cardboard to taste like. These waffles are not worth $8.00! I've had better vegan waffles at other places overall."}
{"text":"Thank you so very much for having a place that my entire family - and especially me - could enjoy lunch.  I have Celiac Disease and finding a restaurant with one or two items that are gluten free is sometimes frustrating.  But an entire restaurant - woo hoo!!

I have been craving getting a hamburger - WITH A BUN - for a long time rather than having the meat on a plate and no bun.  So I was thrilled to enjoy your burger.  But funny thing - my hubby and family enjoyed their meal too.

So thanks for all that you do.  Just one suggestion - as I mentioned on our visit - would love fries!  I know its costly.  Hopefully your business will continue to thrive and there will be one soon."}
{"text":"This place is great ! Super friendly staff that can educate you if you have questions. Great selection! I've been back twice in 3 days. They have all kinds of healthy options . I'm generally eating Paleo style and they have tons of options."}
{"text":"5 stars all the way! Great gluten free food! Had the blueberry pancakes - yum! Kenny the owner is awesome and super friendly - he is so accommodating and willing to do whatever he can to make your visit great. Will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Every item on the menu is delicious and extremely healthy. The smoothies are full of fresh ingredients and protein. The pastries taste even better than their unhealthy counterparts. They give samples of most items so you can taste a variety of food they offer. I highly recommend Great Grubbing."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in awhile, and stopped in for breakfast.  I wanted something different than the usual vegan doughnut and coffee.  They were very helpful and knowledgeable about their menu, and made some suggestions for me.  I had a latte which was very smooth-I had to check to make sure there was espresso in it! I then had some pancakes with blueberries that were pretty good.  I'm not a big pancake fan, but they hit the spot, and would recommend them.  
The vibe was very relaxed, and they were all so kind and friendly-worth it just for that.  They really want you to be happy and enjoy their food.  I will definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"Meh! Over priced? Yes! Lack of products? Yes! Gave me food poisoning? Yes!!! 

I was so excited to try a spot that offered vegan & meat options. My husband eats meat & I do not so places like this always intrigue me. 
When I saw on their menu they offered a homemade vegan burger my tummy was ready! My husband decided on a club sandwich. I also ordered an ice coffee. The ice coffee came out quickly & when they informed me where the creamer was I expected to find real cream or at least milk. There was only fake creamer. Ick! Next, someone came out to tell me they were out of vegan burgers! I thought they made them in house. He gave me other options that really weren't what I wanted, but I ended up with basically a veggie sandwich. I thought I'd at least get the avocado I paid extra for, but no. The best thing about the sandwich was the bread. It was definitely homemade. My husband's sandwich was basically something I could have made at home for a lot less then the $10! It looked nothing like a club sandwich & the bacon was so sad. I wasn't even sure if it was bacon at first. It was a disappointing experience to say the least. 
Maybe 45 minutes later my tummy was rumbling & let's say it wasn't a good rumble. Great Grubbing does not live up to its name. Thanks for a literal crappy experience."}
{"text":"Great place to take your family members and friends who have food allergies or intolerances! Was able to get some WAFFLES for my three year old that were wheat/corn/egg/soy/dairy free! And they tasted yummy! They seem to only use Bob's red mill gluten/wheat free baking flour - which is one of the best for food sensitive folks. Service was great! Food tasted great! A bit more expensive than your average breakfast/lunch place - but you know you're supporting a small business and a restaurant that is perfect for those of us with food allergies/intolerances. Stress free dining! =)"}
{"text":"Best smoothie place. I love their bullet proof coffee. It rocks. Good service and the owner now has delivery. I order at work almost every day. I'm loosing  weight and always eating right. Good job on delivery. It helps me make good choices."}
{"text":"Great grubbing for sure.  I was in Vegas for the 4th and staying at my timeshare near South Point.  I decided to look for a smoothie or healthy bakery store.  Great Grubbing came up and it didn't disappoint.  I had the protein waffles with peanut butter, white chocolate chips and bananas.  Yummy.  Grabbed two mini muffins and peanut butter balls for the road."}
{"text":"What a wonderful breakfast!!! Banana waffles!! Absolutely delicious!! Great service!! Can't wait to go back! Going to do lunch this time!!!"}
{"text":"Great Grubbing is a great place to enjoy a healthy meal!!!

They have delicious sandwiches, smoothies, pizzas and cheesecake.
Unlike other places, these guys really do make the food guilt free. 
It's a perfect establishment before or after a workout.

The menu is designed by people who have a lot of knowledge in nutrition.
For example, the desserts  they make include stevia and a combination of protein powder to reduce the some sugar content and calories. 
Stevia is natural, unlike other sugar substitutes. 
It's made from a leaf related to popular garden flowers like asters and chrysanthemums.

Also, the sandwiches and pizza they are made gluten free, and organic. That's great for me because occasionally I'll have a pizza craving and instead of going to a pizza joint  I'll come here get my fix. Save myself lots of agony going to the gym the next day.

Customer service is awesome!!! 
Kenny and his staff are kind and knowledgeable people, it's a cool environment."}
{"text":"This a great little café that serves some the best gluten free and vegan food I have ever had. I have been all over the world but, Great Grubbing has the best gluten free foods I have ever had. The ingredients can ONLY be described as pure and his sandwiches are some of the few that DO NOT hurt my stomach (which for me is a miracle). I highly recommend Great Grubbing especially, when in Henderson."}
{"text":"I went to this bakery today for vegan cupcakes. I was amazed at how good and textured and moist they were. They were regular sized cupcakes for $3.00 each, and my daughter ate them without leaving me but a crumb! Incidentally, the owner had a dynamic personality and his front girl was full of information about vegan foods and places to eat. I also tried their Kung Pao Chicken gluten free. It was excellent! Just know the side of sauce is very hot...."}
{"text":"Smoothie was awesome. Wasn't a huge fan of the sandwich, over priced and just plain in my opinion. I will definitely be back for another smoothie though"}
{"text":"Great environment in this restaurant. Super clean and the employees are extremely friendly. If you want great food for a good price then this is the spot."}
{"text":"Just tried this place out for the first time! The employees were super friendly and attentive! I ordered the Vegan Guacamole burger and it was great! It was super filling and had good flavor. I also tried one of their Vegan chocolate chip cookies to share with my little one and we both loved it! It might be one of the best vegan baked goods I've ever had. I will definitely be back to try more!"}
{"text":"One of the worst I've seen. Nothing is fat free, except on the pictures (misleading advertisement); The muffins were not mini they were 1/2of the minis, so you need at least 10 of those to make one regular muffin bringing the price to $7.99 for one muffin that is not fat free. The cheese cake was half of your ordinary slice and it was regular cheese case with mocha in the batter, the sandwiches were not any better for $9.50. There was no light or flower or even some green. It was a dinky place--for lack of a better word--with outrageous prices and with one patron siting on a corner table with a smooth. I can't recommend this."}
{"text":"A new great healthy food choice.

Their smoothies are delicious, their sandwiches are handmade on the spot and the fixings are fresh and their gluten free selection will fool even the most savvy sweet tooth.

The home made nut butters are not to be missed!

Vegan/veg friendly and for the carnivores out there they serve a large selection of meat as well so there is something for everyone!

5 stars!"}
{"text":"I recently went to Las Vegas, I decided to stop by for lunch at Great Grubbing. I was warmly greeted by the friendly staff and met the owner Kenny Knoll. He recommended the beef bone broth soup with noodles and fried egg to try. I also ordered the chicken bowl with fried egg as well. I enjoyed them both. Great flavor with the soup. Loved the chicken bowl. I ended my meal with protein filled muffins, white chocolate macadamia nut and salted caramel peanut butter...enjoyed them. Next time I'm back to Las Vegas, definitely will return to Great Grubbing and try out their breakfast menu."}
{"text":"This place is just no good, I came here with a friend he ordered a pizza and i a smoothie,  it was the most disgusting blan pizza he'd ever had, the crust is cheap but the price is not, I would never come back, and that's too bad because they had vegan pizza I was planning to try next time, the smoothie was alright, but how do you mess up a smoothie.... by forgetting to offer the vegan protein supplement."}
{"text":"I am so excited to finally get to try this place. My daughter has a ton of food allergies and we are all gf. They took their time explaining the menu and double checked all of the  ingredients for us. It is so nice to find somewhere we can all find something we actually want to eat."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this short, and sweet. If you want delicious, clean smoothies or gluten free, vegan items come here!!"}
{"text":"We came here and we all ordered the club. They ran out of all types of bread except wheat, which tastes like prison bread. 3 out of 4 came out and they forgot the last one. We didn't realize it till 2 other tables got food. We told them and another 10 minutes later, we got the 4th sandwich. Then, later on I realized they didn't even put turkey on my club. I paid $18 for a meal that didn't even taste good and didn't fill me up. The total lack of organization is laughable. The food is sub par. I'd never come back."}
{"text":"Celiac friendly!! Gluten free waffles. Gluten free everything. I'm in heaven.  The staff is great and their bread is homemade. They have one broth for sale too which is great for the gut! Love, love, love it here."}
{"text":"#greatgrubbing #vegan #glutenfeee I went for breakfast on Sunday and ordered pizza. Pizza for breakfast yummmmm. I'm eating the leftovers now and it is just as wonderful as it was on Sunday! The staff is very friendly and will even text/call the person who made a product to confirm ingredients! I have had zero issues after eating here. Gluten free and tastes great, too. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Welcome in by green pandas!  This place opened up less than 6 months, we have been here 3 times already.  We tried many desserts but today we ordered vegan pizza. 
Everything is good so far. We will be back."}
{"text":"Have you been to this place?! Because you should go. It's awesome, I love it, they're gonna know my name whether I like it or not, I kind of want to live there (Sentence version of hashtags...because I refuse to do them....stubborn).

Light joking aside...I was looking into places with healthier food...and I just didn't expect to adore it as much as I did...because hey, let's be fair, most 'health food' sucks (Replace ingredients I've known and loved for what now?). But I'm IN LOVE with our selections..which I wish I could take a pic of...but we are it. We had a vegan pizza with pineapple and jalapeño (personal fav), and they did not let me down with taste. We also got to meet the owner, who happens to be rad as hell, a super friendly chick with all the know how..and their incredible chefs (one of which tried a new recipe that he let us taste..I died a little from happiness and asked for more to bring home immediately). We took one peanut butter and one piña colada cheesecake (vegan and all that good stuff) and LOVED it. And, because it's not overly laden with sugar and all that addictive crap, you can actually enjoy really flavor without getting the shakes to eat the whole thing and be a beached whale. Upside? More for another day..:)"}
{"text":"Great grubbin is my go to when I want a healthy meal but I don't feel like cooking. I usually get a buffalo chicken wrap and a dragon smoothie. Their protein muffins are pretty delicious and addicting too! I can easily eat the entire bag in a day. Prices are a little expensive but healthy food doesn't come cheap. 

Kenny is also an awesome owner. He makes time to really talk to his customers. You can tell he cares about each person that walks in. Love that it's so much more closer to me now!"}
{"text":"Great scratch cooking! My wife and I are vegan and we really appreciate all of the options. Dairy free waffles, Pancakes, French toast, biscuits and gravy, dragon coffee with alternative proteins/flavors, home made veggie burgers and buns. We leave stuffed every time. And healthily meats for the carne's. The owner is awesome, and the staff is super helpful and nice. Kind of hidden, so hit map and stop in!"}
{"text":"When you are in Vegas check out this healthy great place! Grabbed a smoothie and Kenny the owner is so nice! Great food that never disappoints you! Would tell all my friends about Great grubbing!"}
{"text":"Was recommended to check this spot out by a client of mine.  Not disappointed.  My husband has been feeling ill to the stomach the past few days and the young guy working the counter directed me to some bone broth and suggested a health shot for me when I mentioned my own concern on getting sick.  The health shot was spicey but definitely cleared my sinus' and gave me a nice little boast.  My husband was happy with his bone broth that I served over white rice and a few leeks.  Also try the Jun kombucha, a little sweet but a lovely treat for yourself.  I'll add the other star if I wake up to a healthier hubby :)

Update:
5 star review earned! I woke up to my husband feeling good and commenting on how his body didn't ache and he's ready to take our son to school! Definitely will be returning!"}
{"text":"LIVES UP TO ITS NAME

I met the owner of Great Grubbing, Kenny, almost a year ago at a local community event where he was promoting his new store.  Flash forward to today when I FINALLY stopped by his place at the corner of Windmill and Eastern.  I've heard lots of great things about Great Grubbing and they're true.

GLUTEN-FREE:  this is not a necessity for me, but lots of people like it.
NUTRITION FACTS:  I do like this feature of the menu.  I'm a nerd who tracks her food (most of the time) so I appreciate knowing the macros of what I'm putting into my stomach.

ON THE MENU:
- Protein smoothies (no purees, concentrates, or juices). Protein options are GF whey, egg white, or V-Pro Vegan
9 different smoothies to choose from.  I had the Caribbean Green with mango, pineapple, banana, spinach, and kale.  Yelpers get a free add-in with Yelp check-in; I chose ch- ch- ch- chia seeds.  You can also create your own smoothie.

- Coffee and tea:  100% organic from Boyd's (100% fair trade)
organic milks (almond, soy, coconut, nonfat)
Real Water is used for brewing (alkaline water)
Bulletproof Coffee and Green Tea available (MCT or coconut oil and grass fed or ghee butter)
espresso, latte, cappucino, mocha, Americano, and COLD BREW also on the menu.

-Food
Pizzas (vegan crust available), sandwiches, salads, and bowls also available.  The deli meats are 100% all natural with no artifical ingredients, preservatives, steroids, or hormones.
Protein-filled muffins, cheesecakes, plus breakfast omelettes are also served up.

There is so much great stuff going on here that it will take a few visits to try more than just a smoothie.  If you want a healthy place to eat served up by some very friendly, healthy-minded folks, stop by GG."}
{"text":"I CANNOT say enough wonderful things about this place. The staff is efficient, and yet, the vibes are very chill and happy. The menu selection is awesome, especially for those of us who are vegan and or gluten-free, but there's really something for everyone. So far, I've tried the vegan biscuits and gravy, the vegan burger, and now I'm trying the vegan chocolate chip waffles. It doesn't get better. I hope this place is around for years to come! Who doesn't love when we get a cool small restaurant in Henderson (that isn't a large chain)? Definitely come check this place out, especially if you have dietary restrictions. This is my new \"place.\""}
{"text":"I went in after a yoga class over at Trufusion and decided that trufusions smoothies were way over priced and I hoped that this place was more reasonable! 

It sure was, 20oz smoothie with protein for 6.84 after tax. I got a green smoothie, green machine, green extreme, sorry I cannot remember the name but it was yummy. I try and stay away from all the drinks with a ton of blended fruit because I really don't like drinking that much sugar, I would rather eat it. (Wink) 

The consistency was nice and it filled me up! I would absolutely come back again and try some food!"}
{"text":"I've been here before and their rice bowls are phenomenal. I also love the cheesecake desserts although some can be hit or miss.  However I was extremely disappointed in their smoothie options. They had some interesting combinations but many of them were only three or four ingredients. Nothing substantial. I generally go to protein house and get their Smoothie the hulk for the same price which has; coconut milk almond butter, vanilla whey, spinach, a banana, and a date. I ended up getting the pumpkin pie smoothie with a recommended caffeine shot for extra needed energy. It must've been a synthetic caffeine because it gave the whole smoothie a bitter aftertaste. Probably won't come here again for a smoothie unless I'm feeling adventurous but other than the very limited options they have some great items that nobody else offers."}
{"text":"Great Grubbing is an awesome place to get a smoothie. The food is awesome also. Try the Pink Dragon so good."}
{"text":"From out of town, great gluten free food find! Yum! Will come next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Nolan made me the pink dragon it was very good for being so healthy I'm not one to try healthy places but this is defiantly a place I would recommend to anyone! The staff was friendly and helped me out when I didn't know what I wanted!"}
{"text":"Very tasty and happy with the all natural ingredients. For someone who is trying to stay gluten free even without an allergy, this place made it easy. The hubby had the french toast and it was awesome. I really enjoyed the avocado toast blt. 

Make sure to give yourself more time, they make everything fresh so it takes longer, but well worth it."}
{"text":"Literally worst restaurant experience of many of our 12 person groups' lives. This past Sunday on Labor day weekend 2016 at 830am. 12 ppl in our group. It took the cashier 20 mins just to ring us up. He was slow. So was the kitchen staff. It then took 40 minutes for them to finish our togo order. We tried different things. No one liked what they got from burnt eggs, everything was dry and bland sauces we weak. basically just mayo...from various sandwiches to French toast to biscuits and gravy to omlettes. the sandwiches were dry and bland. They were out of white bread on Sunday morning?? A staple item on their menu??? A couple people got smoothies and that was the only thing anyone said was decent most likely because the chef was a blender."}
{"text":"The girl at the register was amazing, offered great input and very nice. We ordered two smoothies, waffle, and a sandwich.   The smoothies were warm and the waffles were the worst waffles I have ever had, almost like they forgot sweetener of some kind. The sandwich was below average. The whole order cost $35 and was horrible. The two stars are only for the cashier."}
{"text":"Healthy cheesecakes, muffins, cookies, donuts, and smoothies?! They do exist and they're delicious! Everything is made with no oil, butter, shortening, flour, or sugar and sweetened with stevia. Cute little shop with tables to eat and complimentary fruit infused water and customer service was excellent. I recommend the banana, chia, coconut, and cashew cheesecake and the New Zealand lamb meatballs. Check them out and be sure to stop by after Labor Day weekend! (Overheard the owner saying they'll start serving sandwiches etc)"}
{"text":"This place was so good! First time here I got the Vegan Garden Burger. It was the best veggie burger I've had in a long time. The bread tasted just as good if not better than the burger. I've never been into vegan food before but I just might give it a more thorough try!"}
{"text":"Like what they do here! Food is so good and very tasty! If you are looking for gluten free and healthy eats, this is the place! 

Try their muffins! The gluten free apple pie rocks!"}
{"text":"Great food, very friendly staff. Kenny, the owner, is so nice and friendly and will do anything to make your meal the best it can be. 
Make sure to try the dragon coffee w/ salted caramel protein! Wow!"}
{"text":"I had gone here with my expectations a bit high due to reading all of these positive yelp reviews but unfortunately I was a bit let down. I did have a positive experience but I feel I'll have to go again for a true feeling of the place. 

On my visit I was served by two young girls who seemed new to the café and were still learning the ropes. I ordered a Pumpkin Pie shake but unfortunately I was made the wrong one, which I didn't notice until I had left and on my way to work so I couldn't go back. The one seemingly experienced girl didn't seem to help out the young girls very much so I felt bad for the two that were working. It was a great thing to see a place that offers young kids a job to begin experience. 

I also bought two cheesecakes. My absolute favorite was the Lemon Blueberry Poppyseed cheesecake. It had a good crunch from the poppyseed, a good blueberry taste, and a nice hint of lemon. Making that last through my shift was a tough one! I also bought a mocha...something cheesecake. I don't remember the name and I only took one bite. It just wasn't a good flavor combination to me and seemed a bit too sweet. 

I'll be returning to the café because I have pretty high hopes for this place. I wish my first experience was enough to hook me! I love the décor of the place and all the pictures on the wall that show they treat their patrons like family and that the staff is a family of its own. I hope that my next experience will be better. When I visit again I'll definitely try another shake and more of their foods."}
{"text":"It's Halloween at 1:30 pm and it feels amazing outside right now. I arrive here and they have their double doors wide open! Yes! I decided to dine in. 

A man with a long beard greeted us kindly and walked us through the menu. Unfortunately he wasn't the one who took our order. Instead, it was a younger guy that did. He wasn't enthusiastic or very knowledgable about the items he was selling.  
There was homemade packaged desserts where they take orders, I bought two!
He recommended a banana nut bread, but we didnt enjoy it all that much. Just wish it had more texture. 

The rice bowls are good only IF you buy a sauce (extra) with it because alone it would lack flavor. 

The smoothies had potential. Although we didn't enjoy either of ours. Mine was actually under blended and had big pieces of apple fibre inside with every sip. And the other was thoroughly blended. I found this rather weird.

All in all, the place is pretty cool inside, staff can be helpful or not, depending on who it is ...

In my opinion, I wouldn't come back here.

I payed $44.00 for 2 rice bowls, 2 smoothies & 2 desserts ... I'd rather eat at a restaurant."}
