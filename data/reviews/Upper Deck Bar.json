{"text":"The view was amazing, and we went there on a Saturday night, the live band was great and we had lots of fun, loved the vibe and music and crowd"}
{"text":"The bar/restaurant is attached to the Marina, and is a well kept secret. It's not private, but could appear so. The food is only average and basic pub food. The beer/wine selection scant. But, the view is extraordinary, and there are a lot of \"characters\" at the bar. I could be one of 'em."}
{"text":"So we get off the boat and what's the first stop...beers.  This place is your nearest option.  The deck was not crowded for a Sunday afternoon in the summer.  Didn't get to explore the upstairs but it really wasn't needed as the view from downstairs was worth 1,000 words.  Draft beer choices were limited to Alexander Keith's IPA and Stella and ran you about $11 for a pint after tax and tip.  Once again your paying for the view on this one.  Opted not to get food but there is a small menu as well as a full bar option of liquor drinks."}
{"text":"I had a salad and my boyfriend had the BLT with extra bacon. It was very fresh and good. We went there thinking the food was gonna be bad cause of all the reviews but I was surprised. Beautiful view and good food"}
