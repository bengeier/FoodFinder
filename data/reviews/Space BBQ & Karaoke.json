{"text":"Bad experience 
I been there for several times, but every single time was a horrible experience. I went there with my friend, at that time, we are the only table there. We ordered a lot of food, and I try to talk with my friend. Unfortunately, all the staffs who work there are talking loudly, and then they start singing. Since they have karaoke in the dining room, there are four of them start singing in front of us. We couldn't even talk with each other. We try to get some help from then, but seems like nobody cares about us. My friends are from another state, and them had really bad experience in Vegas. Not willing to go there again."}
{"text":"Great place! Great food! Great atmosphere! The owner is very friendly and will chat with you all you want. We also loved the severs! Incredible singers! THE PLACE for late night KARAOKE!"}
{"text":"I love the environment and the atmosphere. Good food and the servers were very pleasant to talk to. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very cool place.  Karaoke. Best bbq In town.  Chinese style bbq. Nice service and hooters ladies.  Best place you wanna go."}
{"text":"great place to go for BBQ, lots of choices to select from! Staff are very friendly! A must go place in Las Vegas China Town!"}
{"text":"Cute place! The BBQ and mini hotspot are tasty! We also had a great time in the karaoke room!"}
{"text":"An awesome place! We had a great time singing Karaoke in a very cute room! The food is very authentic and spicy! We loved it! If you like BBQ, you must try this place."}
{"text":"Found this Chinese BBQ bistro in China Town and had late dinner here around 9pm with my friend. They not only offered Chinese BBQ and hot pot, but also karaoke. We ordered some Chinese BBQ, including beef, tendon, lamb, chicken, squid, duck neck, bum, rice cake and etc. Most of them were spicy, which were really good. I especially loved the bum, served with condensed milk, which was amazing. Really loved this place!"}
{"text":"Great food! BBQ and hotpot are both perfect! 
And we had a lot of fun in karaoke room. Very cute decor inside the room~ and it got all the songs we want to sing~~ awesome!! Def come back again during our next trip"}
{"text":"If  you like Chinese BBQ, definitely have to try this restaurant! The food are really awesome, compared with other Chinese BBQ restaurant  in Vegas."}
{"text":"It wasn't packed but I figure it's because the place isn't well known yet and still kinda new. The place had a variety of delicious skewers. Service was great. Definitely a place to try!"}
{"text":"Such a nice place to hang out with friends!! And with the delicious foods as well!!! Their skewers are the best in town, and they just add the hot pot to the menu as well, total 8 styles. we will definitely come back!!!"}
{"text":"Refused to serve us. As soon as we walked out after not being served they immediately came and pushed in our chairs behind us. We feel discriminated against. Will never be back."}
{"text":"At first this place was good. The food was really good and the service was very friendly. Went back for the 3rd time & they were so rude right off the bat. We had 2 new servers than we normally do both of them females. Every time we asked for something, they gave us the most snobby glaring look ever. Their food was just okay this time. The rice cake was terrible. It was so hard and you can barely chew on it."}
{"text":"It takes a lot to upset me enough to leave a bad review, but this place definitely took me there! We get there and was taken to small room where they were setting up the sound system and karaoke machine. We waited fifteen minutes for them to TRY and figure out how to get it to work. After all attempts failed they took us to another room. The system was working in this room, but after singing one song, the microphone died! We had to go ask for new batteries. For someone as technologically savvy as myself their system is not user friendly at all and very limited with the selection. Then once you play a song there's a 50/50 chance they don't have the instrumental for it and you have to sing along with the original artist. Are you kidding me?! There's an option to turn the original artist off and when we did that the lyrics and music were TERRIBLY off! When you turned it back on it worked perfectly! They obviously have an issue with their system they need to fix! Overall my whole party had a terrible experience. To top it all off, when it was time to pay, they tried to charge us for the time they couldn't get the machinery to work. When I tried to explain that, the employee holding our debit card charged our card anyways. Needless to say, we don't be coming back. It was my brother's birthday and we went there to celebrate and my brother left very unhappy. We tried to make the best of it but they gave us very little yo be happy about. I strongly recommend Karaoke Q Studio over this place!"}
{"text":"Decent food and great service!A special place that is worth trying."}
{"text":"Great food, fantastic service, had a nice time here with my friend (: the spicy hotpot was actually spicy, I enjoyed my time here"}
{"text":"I found this before heading back to San Francisco  and they surprised me.
Very nice staff. The waitress answer every question I asked.
Food was delicious. Very fast WiFi. 
We finished every single plate :)
Will be back when we travel again to LV."}
{"text":"Food is good Asian style skewers, with good staff. Decent price for good food and a nice atmosphere. Karaoke price is ok but with food and drinks it's reasonable. Lack of liquor is disappointing but the price of the price makes up for it . The selection and price of beer is unfortunate but a overall good experience with alcohol and food, both in the restaurant  and  and karaoke experience."}
{"text":"Me and my friend are trying new places to eat, we stumbled here at space BBQ, we gave it try, we don't regret it!!  We order Beef Stew mix it with the  Steam Rice and Pow!! Unique taste and juices are amazing. If you're wondering or been questioning this place, gave it go. Try their Beef Stew! With the Rice  trust me. It's bomb AF!!"}
{"text":"The place has some really good Taiwanese style BBQ skewers. The only drawback is the grilled \"sausage.\" That item was literally a Hebrew National Hot Dog, cut and seasoned with cumin. That was disappointing. It was cooked well and the added seasoning is something I would not do at home, but the disappointment comes because I was expecting a sausage. Just call it a hotdog, guys, and I would have not ordered it. On a positive note, I suggest getting the \"Grill Wrapped Beef or Lamb.\" This is the first time I enjoyed cooked celery! I'm shocked at how delicious this dish is!"}
{"text":"For good hot pot near Chinatown, Space BBQ is an affordable, casual option. The ambiance is casual, there was no wait, and the staff is super friendly and attentive. I came in a group of four and we got two hot pot bowls and a few skewers. The broth was delicious and there was more than enough food, even though at first glance the bowls seemed small. They also came by and refilled the bowls with hot water so there was always enough soup. For the money, this was a good dinner choice. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Good Location?If you like Chinese Barbecue, must try! A lot can choose! It is very clean and good service. You can find something very Chinese traditional and special here."}
{"text":"The seafood was very delicious. Very delicious. Good friendly service with karaoke for entertainment. 
They played G dragon. Which is sick. Interior is finely decorated and very welcoming and vibrant."}
{"text":"No chance to taste the food since our server never took our order. Within a few minutes a server asked us if we're ready, but we had barely looked through through the menus. Once we did go through them we waited about 30 minutes for the server to come by again. My boyfriend tried making eye contact with a waiter a few times too lol. We ended up leaving. My boyfriend wants nothing to do with this place, but maybe with a different wait staff I'd love to try again!"}
{"text":"Nice place to eat and chill or even have some alcohol! They reopened and made a lot of changes but the workers definitely all know what they're doing and are really friendly.

I'm a huge eater and thought the hot pot (lamb) wouldn't be enough but I actually couldn't finish it. A bowl of rice comes free too with the pot. The soup tasted great. Had some Asian herbs and stuff that I could definitely taste.  

As for skewers I personally love the grilled buns served with condensed milk, as well as some chicken gizzards. Don't let those organ name parts scare you off! Asian places are famous for these and it's cooked really well. I actually want some again now as I'm typing this review.."}
{"text":"It is one of my favorite restaurant. Food are special and delicious. I strongly recommended."}
{"text":"The food was great. Very fast and friendly service. The bbq is right on and very tasty. One of the best bbq in town. Definitely recommend. They also have happy hour Monday to Thursday and karaoke. Very nice place."}
{"text":"Food is excellent, very friendly staff and had so much fun singing karaoke with my friends!

Will definitely return next time I go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"very nice service!great atmosphere !The owner is friendly and considered. If you want have a party,I recommend this place. It never let you down"}
{"text":"I passed by this restaurant / bar / karaoke, when it was too late to be seated at sushi neko. I quickly realized that it was new so I was like, \"why not give this place a try.\" Came in on a weekday night, wasn't really busy. I didn't wait that long to be seated either. 

Customer service (1/5) - they really lacked communication skills. First off, we had to ask two different employees if they served rice (it wasn't on the menu) the first employee said that they only had bacon fried rice. Then we asked the second employee and he said they do serve white rice?? Second, our server didn't know which food was what. Pretty much we didn't know what we were eating. Third, my boyfriend was waiting by the registers to be rung up, but they were just standing there looking at him. There was a bit of a language barrier or it probably was just communication skills? 

Food (2.5/5) - Price was ok ($5 or less for a skewer). But majority of the food had the same seasoning... so they all tasted almost the same. The seasoning was overpowering for some dishes. But my most favorite would have to be the grilled oysters! I never been to a restaurant that grilled their oysters! Grilled oysters are my favorite! They add a bit of garlic on top and it tasted heavenly!! (This was probably the only thing that didn't have that seasoning). 

Overall, it was an ok experience. I may come back for the grilled oyster & if they improve their communication skills. But they are a new restaurant, so I'm hoping it was only because they were new! Would love to come back if customer service and other things change."}
{"text":"Excellent skewer place. Killer prices. Quiet atmosphere. Big place accommodated 7 people easily. Nice service. 

Would come again."}
{"text":"Very nice food and service!! Tasty szchuan skewers and cool karaoke system :) perfect place for a little drink."}
{"text":"This is place is getting worse and worse. I will vote for them to be worst restaurant of Las vegas who give them the courage to open a restaurant with all this nasty food. I have been eating here twice , and both of time they don't even put salt on the food... . The food a not fresh too. I got through up at night."}
