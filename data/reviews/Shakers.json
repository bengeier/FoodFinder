{"text":"What could I possibly say about this place that hasn't already been said.... The food has always been great, along with the staff - mostly. I mean as someone with inside knowledge I understand why the T.V's in the men's bathroom are falling down. I understand why the owner is 'spastic' we will say. I understand it all from the owners down to the dishwashers and the woman owner is on drugs as is the \"handy\" man they keep around to rob them blind. I knew all this stuff. Just thought I'd share as a foodie to many other foodies. If you don't believe me you can see for yourself. In not so sure these are over the counter drugs either, ba"}
{"text":"Great place to chill have some drinks ...the food is good and the bartenders our friendly good place to go check it out"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good neighborhood bar for a few months now and I've been generally disappointed by the bars in the area. I was so turned off by the Ragin' Cajun (the old place) that it's taken me a bit to try out Shakers, but I swung by last night (Saturday).   Overall, it's a great neighborhood bar. I'm surprised at these reviews because I got great service--the bartenders seemed genuine and had personalities, rather than just talking to you to get a tip. They made me feel welcomed and I love the feel the place has. The food was good, and really really inexpensive (but good quantity and quality) and the drinks were a great price. It's new, and the owners are looking for any ideas, and it was great to be part of the process. I'm really excited to see what it'll grow to become. All in all, give it a chance. I'm really happy I did."}
{"text":"We usually go in on the weekends - sometimes, we turn around and leave right away, sometimes we stay.  Why do we keep going back?  The help is friendly, the food is decent and very reasonably priced.  Why do we walk out sometimes?  They can't get their TVs straight.  We go to watch football games, and the TVs are often on local channels (imagine shows for kids) or paid programming.  It takes a long time to get food ordered, delivered and paid for - the help is really trying, but they are often overwhelmed."}
{"text":"Fun place. Great band!!! We didn't eat there but many people said the food was just typical bar food. Really no complaints since we just had beer but only 3 stars because tap beer was in back room! Strange."}
{"text":"Shakers is a local bar. Good spot . Avoid the bartender Michelle she tends to talk bad about customers when they ask a couple questions and ignores customers . A lot of the staff is helpful especially if you get Vanessa ,Sean or Danielle , great , nice and they definately go out of the way for you....Ooh one other watch out for the owners weird wife or girlfriend shes crazy and , well lets just say we left . Overall great and good times until...."}
{"text":"I first stumbled into Shakers on a whim.  I used to drive past it to get home every day.  I remember when it was mardi gras and wanted to see the changes since new ownership took over.  To my delight,  I happened to go on wednesday, which is all you can eat wings day.  $8.99 is a steal compared to other joints.  I have to say,  the wings were freshly cooked and piping hot!  Probably some of the best in the area!  I frequent shakers now on a regular basis.  I work on the weekends so i haven't been in for their live shows, but i hear they are awesome!!!   They are putting a lot of work into renovating the venue.  The house sound system is amazing.  I love what they have done with the new stage!!  Karaoke night is super fun!  They do it Monday nights.  Karaoke is done through the house sound system so you truly feel like a rockstar!   You would think that Monday nights would be boring, but not at Shakers!   Really good singers and excellent selection of music.  They also have really cheap drink specials and have a 1/2 price appetizer sampler on Mondays.   I also get their pizzas from time to time.  They are deeeee-lish!!!  Its nice to go into a place,  get filled up on food, have 4 or 5 cocktails, enjoy some entertainment, and get out the door for under $20.  I saw a few other reviews of people complaining about service but I have never had a problem.  In fact, Vanessa, one of their bartenders  remembered exactly what I drank from the 1st time I went in.  I've seen it get busy on some Mondays and her and Edie do an awesome job keeping up and certainly know how to pour great drinks!    I've had the pleasure to meet the owners of Shakers on a few occasions.  They seem like really cool people and I can tell they are interested in bringing Scottsdale locals a fun place to eat, drink, and be entertained without making you mortgage your house to pay the tab like other Scottsdale hot spots.    I highly recommend Shakers for food drinks, and entertainment!! :-D  Thanks!"}
{"text":"This is a great neighborhood bar, the staff is amazing, there's plenty to do like live music and pool, and I die for that steak sandwich.  Their fries are pretty much the best I've ever had and I love what they have on tap.  As well as their prices!  This place has gone through a lot of change, as fairly new restaurants will do, but I hope it stays how it is now.  Haven't had they breakfast in awhile but when I did, it was wonderful."}
{"text":"Ugh today it was a struggle going here.  Just wanted a couple beers after work, 1 pm, and the service was horrible. I usually have a good experience here but not this time. Took over 25 mins to get a beer, 1 and done would have stayed longer went to Papago brewery instead."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday mid day to find Ibitas on sale for a dollar.  Yep, just one buck...and not on happy hour.  Friendly staff and a chill neighborhood vibe, to boot."}
{"text":"Stepped into this place just off the menu for lunch yesterday & had a great experience. From the special on Friday, all you can eat fish and then Taco Salad with chicken. But TODAY---- I came back for drinks and stumbled upon thee best drink I drank ever \"Jalape√±o Margarita\". All thanks to Wendy, she is the best person with a banging personality. I'll come back here for sure!!"}
{"text":"Well 2 years later like all the others Shakers is closed down.  I actually stop going there after about a year or so, the pricing and staffing changed to much.  Wendy was the best, after her departure that sealed the deal for us and Shakers really didn't last that much longer.  They were on their way to something good but got detoured and failed.  The owners cleaned it up allot so you'll get a much nicer bar if in the market."}
{"text":"Great potential bar. SLOW service.  I went in there, ordered a drink and food to go and took over an hour to get both and my check... After they figured out how the bill worked."}
{"text":"Great prices, good bartenders and there are usually seats at the bar. They have a good kitchen and super good daily specials. I am definitely a fan and have been since they opened. I love the chicken tacos!"}
{"text":"Right in our neighborhood,we've wanted the past four bars this place has been to work out. I think Shakers finally has it right. We wander over there all the time, cheap drinks, good bar food. Shawn helped us the last time we were in and was fantastic. Very attentive and friendly but not overbearing. Clearly an experienced bartender.  Options of games on are always endless and if your game isn't one one of the 20 TV's when you arrive, they'll go the extra mile to find it for you.  They did some interior work and the addition of the booths is nice.  We can never figure out why they're not busier? Maybe need some marketing help? Advertise for big games? Not too many people seem to know about it. I see no reason why it shouldn't be as busy as Zipp's or Philly's."}
{"text":"Frozen pretzels, canned cheese sauce and a drunken old clientele. If this is your cup of tea then step into the world of Shakers. The bartender Wendy is nice and loves to talk about her \"Scottsdale\" enhancements, but it's a case a of too little (or too big) too late. Oh well, it's a dive bar with no TV baseball package either. Funniest part was when I pulled apart the frozen piece of my pretzel, the drunk old war veteran guy next to me who was telling me a rambling story from 40 years ago, grabbed the piece and ate the thing. Lasted 45 minutes here and out for good."}
{"text":"Dive bar opening at 6am. Cheap drinks and bar food. Friendly neighborhood place to watch the game, play karaoke and hear live music."}
{"text":"It's never a good thing when most of the conversation at a bar surrounds the improvements that you would make to that bar. Though, the theme was *potential*. Here are some Pro's and Con's to Shakers.  Pros: *Cheap Drinks! If your questing to just knock back a couple of cold ones, this is your spot. Being in Scottsdale, you'll breathe a sigh of relief at the bar tab. *Lots of random beers on tap and friendly bartenders. *Huge venue. For being a divey spot, Shakers has a lot of room to shake your groove thang when you're dancing to Karaoke.  *Pool table and TV's. *Karaoke. The DJ was great and the accompanying guitarist was astoundingly good. He would even do back up vocals or meet you half way on a duet. Very cool.  Cons: *Location is bad. Without a big incentive to go there, I'm going to look elsewhere when finding a place to spend my night, preferably somewhere near other bars. *Food is cheap.  *Lacks uniqueness. Overall, there's nothing really bringing me back.  It's a cool divey bar worth checking out - though, only if you're nearby."}
{"text":"This bar is absolutely amazing.  Great prices, great service, especially from Vanessa.  I am always greeted with a smile and never leave without one. The sound system on Mondays is amazing and rocke always does a great job at keeping his patrons happy."}
{"text":"I've been here a total of 4 times and every time has been great. The bartenders are friendly, they serve you right away,  the service is good, they really try and take care of you. The man working suggested some drinks I should try and they were all very good. I've ordered food here 2 of the 4 times I've been here and it's tasty, better than expected for bar food. Prices are decent not too expensive and the bathrooms are clean. This is one of my new, favorite spots to have a couple of drinks and have a good time."}
{"text":"We used to be regulars when it was Ragin Cajun.  They were always friendly and took the time to say hello and make sure that we were taken care of.  Last night when we went for drinks we sat at a table and waited for 15 minutes.  There were employees at the end of the bar in uniform drinking and looking in our direction.  No one served us or acknowledged our presence. We even gave them the benefit the doubt and moved to the bar for faster service.  Everyone that sat around us got served except for us; we were still ignored, so we subsequently left and went to Papago Brewery."}
{"text":"Shakers is the latest incarnation of a succession of dive-type bars in this location.  This building has housed everything from sports bars to comedy clubs to semi-meth labs (just kidding, but at times in the past, this place has looked like it was decorated by a \"tweaker\".)  I ventured to Shakers a couple of weeks ago with my brother, who discovered the place anew.  It's close enough to his home to qualify as a \"neighborhood bar\", and he had had a nice breakfast experience there. We generally spend our Sundays at Carlsbad Tavern, but are a little tired of waiting until 11AM to have breakfast as well as just needing some regular breakfast food once in a while. So I decided to give it a shot.  (Shakers opens at 6AM for those who like their breakfast early.)  First of all, the place needs an interior makeover.  It looks almost exactly as it did as the Ragin' Cajun, the last bar to occupy the building, and there were some obvious growing pains (such as the beer taps not working, causing the staff to hustle for a draft order).  Furniture could use an upgrade as well.  On the plus side, the mens' room was clean and tidy, a sticking point for me.  The bar is typical \"NFL Sunday Ticket\" friendly, with plenty of TV screens for sports viewing.    My most favorable impression was of the food and liquor prices.  The food is really good, and cheap.  While the house burger is suspiciously shy of the 1/3 pound advertised, the price was right.  I've also had the breakfast quesadilla, which is huge and a steal for $3.99.  So far, the food is Shakers' strongest drawing point.  Beer prices are low, and the staff makes some of the better Bloody Marys I've had lately.  A special shout out to Wendy, one of the bartenders.  Very professional bartender, and a hoot to converse with.  She's very entertaining and engaging.  We'll be back.  If you're looking for a decent sports bar in the south Scottsdale area, with reasonable booze and grub, this is a good pick. Hopefully, Shakers can build a solid neighborhood clientele and will make a go of it.  The location isn't the best, and better signage could probably draw more customers, but I intend to be a \"regular\" here.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"Can I give this place a ZERO? Walked in on a Sunday morning around 9:30AM and it was already filled up with VERY drunk people and loud, inappropriate, and obnoxious music. We wanted a fun place to have breakfast, but instead found a loud dirty bar where we were harassed by drunk people that felt we were \"too clean and overly dressed\" to be in there.  We could not even finish our ONE drink and walked out because of the drunk and disorderly crowd that had already gathered there and continued to verbally attack us. The absolute worst part was the bartenders who did nothing to help get these inebriated people out of the bar...but instead helped US to leave when we were not drunk, loud, or causing problems with anyone.   We are disgraced by the service (or lack of) that we received today.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE and WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN. It is so unprofessional and inappropriate. No more words. It is clear that this bar needs help. PLEASE call John Taffer: \"Bar Rescue\" before it's too late."}
{"text":"This is definitely a dive bar and they seem to cater to the regular locals. I went there one night for dinner and it was rather empty but the few people there seemed like they had been there plenty of times before. The bartenders didn't really attend to us very much and even tried to serve us expired beer as a special! Luckily I overheard them talking about it and didn't order it. The food was well priced and average tasting, fries were good. There are not that many tvs so watching sports there might not be the best choice. With all the other nearby bars, you can easily find something better then this place."}
{"text":"We went in not expecting much. There was ONE person working in the whole place and she spent most of the time dealing some VERY VERY drunk guy.   It's a typical neighborhood bar.   BUT THE FOOD! Hand down, the best nachos I have ever had. Ever. In my whole life. In the history of the multiverse.   Husband had the sliders and raved about them, and he's pretty much a Vulcan... very unemotional and nothing really gets him excited (with the exception of a few things), especially food. He loved these and the nachos too. We were very surprised the food was so good.   We're going back, for sure."}
{"text":"The thing about a bar is that things are predictable. This bar is in the middle of an overhaul. All the GREAT staff including \"bartender of the universe\" Wendie are gone. The food has suffered. The hot wings are no longer grilled, and will drop off my list of decent wings as a result. The nachos also have suffered. So has just about everything else. We know this because I met a bunch of friends here and we all got \"Montezuma's Revenge\" from the food. All of us.They are going for the college crowd but they will lose what they have as a result. Which is a great stop by neighborhood bar. Plenty of choices in Old Town. Heed my warning, Or stock up on Pepto."}
{"text":"I remember when I was a kid this location was some sort of family restaurant, but over the years it's mainly been bars (that I've never been to). Anyways, I came here for breakfast w/my parents and although the food is tasty & cheap the service wasn't very good.  Truth be told I probably would have liked this place a lot more if I would have stopped in for a couple drinks w/friends at night, or even if I came in for breakfast or lunch with them. This place is pretty big (more so than you would think from the outside). It's clean. There's two bars & more than a few big screen TV's. It also looks like they have a quite a few drink specials.   Personally, I don't have high (or any, really) expectations of divey sports bars, food/service wise. If you're lucky it's decent, but you're there to drink. Like I said though, I was here with my parents for breakfast so it was just a different atmosphere.  The place was dead on a Sunday morning. There was no more than two other tables occupied the whole time we were here (there was also a lady at the bar getting plastered at 9 am...please don't let me ever be THAT person). That being said, the service was just bad. It took us forever to get coffee & our food. My dad ordered a milk, and it was brought to him in a tiny glass that you'd get a whiskey in. The menu isn't very extensive (like 7 or 8 choices), so it's hard to imagine this place would ever be out of anything, but sure enough I wasn't able to get huevos rancheros because the beans \"were still cooking\" (they also had another dish that had beans that sounded good, but that was out of the question as well). I got the breakfast taco, and it was actually really tasty. The shell was deep fried and the hash browns it was served with were crispy, which is how I like them. Pretty much every meal on the menu here is under $5 & the portions are good size (my mom had a pretty mammoth size omelet, which she said was very good).   At the end of the day, good cheap food, but painfully slow (and quite frankly, not very good service). I'd probably come back though...especially for drinks to take advantage of those specials."}
{"text":"After a tough first try I gave this place another try.  Very happy I did.  Prices are very reasonable for South Scottsdale.  Breakfast served all day is a plus for me.   Still a great place to see live music."}
{"text":"Terrible, non-existent service. I had a similar experience to a couple of the other reviewers, but the blatant ignoring was even worse. It was about 1pm and I had intended to try lunch here. I walked into the place (which was very darkly lit) and sat myself at a high top table out in the middle of the floor by one of the large flat screen TV's. I noticed about 7 or 8 patrons at the bar. A young man and the female server/bartender (shorter brunette) were gabbing in the back and she saw that I was there, but didn't seem to have any urgency in acknowledging my presence. After about 5 minutes, she finally came over and asked what I'd like to drink. \"Ahhh, finally\" I thought to myself. I ordered a beer from the tap and she said she'd be right back. Well, I checked my watch and I'm not kidding, 5, 6, 7 minutes go by. Nothing. I was sure to lean my body out from my chair and stare up at the bar, where she was laughing it up with the locals. She looked my way a time or two, but other than that, didn't give a rat's behind that I was there. A couple of the patrons (local barflies I'm guessing) even looked over my way and seemed annoyed that I was there, taking away from their precious little social time. Honestly, I've never felt so ostracized or shunned in an establishment before. I finally got fed up and walked out (I have only done this once before in my life!)--let's just say there was no effort to stop me. I work over in the Scottsdale Commerce center and had intended to maybe make this place one of my local haunts/lunch spots, but I'll be sure to go out of my way to steer everyone I know away from this crap-hole."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a beer  on Sunday afternoon. Sat at the bar and waited for the bartender to acknowledge my presence as she  BS'd with customers at the other end of the bar. She realized I was at the bar and with a startled look  took my order. I got my beer and she went back to BS'n with the locals and fiddling putting away beer glasses. What do you expect?  It's a dark outdated 80's dive bar, and I'm okay with that. They do have a couple big screen TV's and a bunch of TV's around the perimeter of the bar and some pool tables.  I guess one redeeming factor is the bartender was wearing a  tight low cut tee shirt with stuff bulging out. I understand this ploy as a method to extract tips from male patrons, however in my case it didn't work. I finished my beer and left.  I doubt I would go back here, there's  many other choices in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Came here, oddly enough, for breakfast on a Friday at 10 am. I'm from out of town and wanted breakfast but not at a cafe or standard breakfast spot. Only about 6 other people here, all at the bar. Plenty of Tvs for sports viewing if you came here to watch a game. Breakfast menu options are adequate. I got pancakes and ham. Pancakes are good but hoped they'd be really big (I love pancakes). It was good, though."}
{"text":"Terrible food. Terrible service unless you get Sean.... the last time I went there the general manager threatened me after spending $150, and tipping 30 percent. He should be charged with assault. The general manager is a drunk. I do not appreciate the threats and demeaning atitutude, I was a regular. This place has gone to hell, just as every other place before it. Avoid at all costs. Dive bar; if you do not want food poisoning stay away. The food will make you throw up, as well as the service and management. Hellhole."}
{"text":"Sunday Morning Football Breakfast Folks!!! Stop on in and grab yourself some happy hour beers and a good breakfast. Loved the pancakes and omelettes. Our server couldn't get it all quite right every time, but we were patient. After my son's breakfast was dropped on the floor, and they forgot his sausage we had hoped for some comp on our bill and were not disappointed. Great vibe - good tv screen positions around the bar and very friendly."}
