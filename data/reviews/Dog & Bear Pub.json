{"text":"friday, 1pm intent on fish and chips and beer. How perfect that this was the very $15 special at Dog & Bear! the best platter of fish and chips I've had, probably ever. Perfectly crisp, seasoned, moist and with lemon and beer - sensational. I'm quite sleepy now, but it was worth it. Great service, no complaints on the music, good for watching Queen Streeters.  And I've had fish and chips at many places who are supposed to specialize in it -and each time I was disappointed with the seasoning really failing, mostly"}
{"text":"My local pub. Popped in for dinner last Friday with the hubs and we had a very pleasant experience - as 3 stars goes, it was A-OK.   We were seated right away (it was pretty quiet as we were rather early for a Friday night, maybe 6:30pm. They have very nice spacious booths that are great for a group or a twosome. Plenty of TVs for sports viewing potential.   Server was very nice and quick, unfortunately my Steamwhistle was a bit flat but they have so many beers on tap I understand how it would be hard to keep them all fresh.   I had fish and chips and they were quite good actually. Haddock was fried perfectly and it was super moist inside. I have to complain a bit on the house made tartar sauce though - there was no bite to it at all. I expect some briney caper/gherkin flavour to hit me right off the bat but it never came. Husband had the buffalo wings and they were perfectly standard.  No complaints about Dog & Bear if you're wanting to catch a game and have some pub grub but it's nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Nothing good. Went there to watch a football gamr. It was busy but found a wobbly cruiser table to commandeer, Leafs were getting pounded late in the third and the bartender wouldn't switch the volume over to the football game.(Don't understand how a sports bar doesn't know what game ismoreimportant)  Got some beers quick(they have no drink menu there?), almost all Molson beers, not that I'm a snob, but if you're gonna go that route, make them clean your lines please. My 1st pint,Granville Island Pale Ale was flat and off. Ordered a Guinness also, I should have returned it it was so bad. Got some grub, fish and chips, chicken fingers, mozzarella sticks(meh, meh, awful)spilled a beer due to wobbly table, was offered another but we couldn't stay there another minute. Beers and food arent cheap either, for that price I could go to any other pub. How hard is it to serve a proper pint of beer, pub fare? Our waitress was really nice.   24hrs later I m still feeling those bad pints  Not going there again."}
{"text":"There aint no other place I want to get down at than Dog and Bear.  Hip hop lovers of the world, welcome."}
{"text":"Tried the chili fries and then later buffalo wings. Both were good, nothing to rave about but nothing to complain about either. Service was good, bartender was quick to pour me another Guinness."}
{"text":"Great English Pub...it's a pub not a fancy resto! Tried the wanks across the street at The Bristol....who think they are way more than they are.....love the D and B....it's a pub what it should be not a wacky Curry House! You got my vote for best pub!"}
{"text":"I really like the vibe and interior, a big nod to Britain which for an ex-pat is a nice side step to home.   Our server was really lovely and accommodating. The food was a little underwhelming and not particularly well presented (the diner style paper for the fries is in stark contrast to the nice surroundings).  Overall, I'd definitely return for a few beers and chill, but would move on when I get the munchies."}
{"text":"Came to watch the raptors game with 6 friends. We ordered food and beer, but two of our friends did not drink (one being a recovering alcoholic, and the other pregnant)  they ordered pop instead. All of us ordered food.  When the game was over and the bill came, we noticed that one of our friends were charged for one refill while the others were given one free refill. So when our friend noticed this, he just kindly mentioned to the server that he was charged for two pops. Now all of us are not cheap, we work good jobs, and love to go out all the time, but he was just asking for clarification, because he thought the waitress simply made an error. The response from the waitress was \"YES WELL YOU DRANK TWO DRINKS DIDN'T YOU\" (with a great amount of attitude). Then being confused he thought she misunderstood, and said no I ordered one (because the bill showed two different drinks). She then responded \"YOU CANT EXPECT TO JUST SIT HERE AND DRINK FOR FREE\". We all looked at each other in disbelief and started to laugh because we couldn't believe that some 20 something, just rolled out of bed hipster was speaking to a customer like that. She also added before walking away \"GUYS.... ITS ONLY TWO DOLLARS (roll eyes)\".  Now it is not about the cost, it just simply didn't make sense, and her attitude was simply disgusting.  I'm regretful we still tipped her.  You should not speak to someone and make them feel bad for not ordering alcohol, especially when you don't know why they are not drinking. Anyways, that little shit should be fired.  That being said- food and drinks were good. service was just no bueno."}
{"text":"We were 7 and they manage to accommodate all of us fast. Very relaxed atmosphere, good food great beer."}
{"text":"If i could give the dog and bear zero stars I would.   After being told several times that \"we do not take reservations\" I arrived at the bar and when I tried to sit at multiple tables we were consistently told \"this table is reserved\".    Obviously, communication is lacking between staff members and management. While the staff realized that this was a problem, there was absolutely no effort to make it right.   Would not recommend or return."}
{"text":"I would rate this a 0 but there is no option for that. This is the worst pub (if you want to call it that) I have ever been to. All my friends were able to re-enter but me. They said I was not in the pub, and I was. My friends had to come out and argue and remind them it was my birthday but the red head bouncer wouldn't budge. He wanted me to wait in another lineup. We all left and I told him thanks for the birthday present. My friends said it was too crowded anyway.."}
{"text":"Perfect spot for Tuesday boozin! At five dollars a pop, their tall cans are a great way to end the week's second working day. The bar also offers some really delicious eats, but they are pretty pricey. We like to go on Tuesdays to catch the game on their huge TVs, throw back a couple cheap drinks, and play some of the board games they keep on their shelves! Cozy Irish pub. Poor service, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick drink, Jenna the host was amazing and incredibly welcoming. She made the entire experience great!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had the all day breakfast and it wasn't great. The sausage & mushrooms were cold. Everything else was ok. We won't be going back in a hurry. The staff were nice though. It may have been a bad day. The pub itself was nice and the atmosphere was good."}
{"text":"Watched the blue Jays game here last time. Great crowd and atmosphere. Great TV screens:)   One of the bartenders was apparently knocked down by someone, and the others rushed out to catch the guy. Police officers arrived all the while the game went on. Koodos to the two remaining bartenders who had to attend to the big crowd! Must have been a crazy buzy night but they kept the place going ;)"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Service is average at best, with a distinct air of  \"i'm too busy being really cool and hip to actually engage you as a human being\". food nothing special and kind of overpriced for what it is.   when i asked for more tea (the first one was brought in a teacup, sans saucer, milk in a brandy snifter), the waitress brought me another teacup with a fresh teabag, which i found a little weird, since i could have done with a pot of water - which is what she should have brought in the first place. i was kind of assuming that since its supposed to be some approximation of a british pub (someone needs to tell them that hanging a bunch of random stuff on the walls does not make a place a british pub), the tea would be flowing. when i got my bill, i found that i had been charged a total of $5 for two teacups of tea?? on top of that, the waitress assumed that i was going to tip her 6$ on a 19$ bill and never brought my change -  i had to wave her down. entitled much? or just no clue? i couldn't decide which it was.  i had high hopes for this place, but its just not that friendly nor special. everyone in the place does that thing where they look just over your shoulder so that they dont have to acknowledge you in any way.   on a more positive note, they do have guinness on tap, and the bathrooms were in excellent condition."}
{"text":"Best sports bar on West queen West.  Bar seats get you some awesome service, and I have to say the Buffalo Chicken nachos are to die for. Watch out their hot but who doesn't love Frank's hot :)"}
{"text":"Got here pretty early on a Saturday and managed to snag seats. Service was quite on point and overall food portions were generous. Nothing extremely fancy but great hearty food, which you can't say for all places. My experience was probably coloured because of the ability to get seats and we didn't have to stand. However, left with a good impression."}
{"text":"I like dogs and I like bears, but I do not like this bar. Ordered a Manhattan (which came out as whisky and dry vermouth) and cost $13. Horrible."}
{"text":"This place is a cool place. The decors awesome and it has a decent menu. All the things I've tried have been good. The service, is terrible. Even sitting at the bar,can be brutal. Not to say, there aren't good servers that might work here. But every time I've been here it's been dodgy."}
{"text":"This place is excellent, service, food, staff, great pub and much needed in the Queen West West area.  Rhino and Caddy serve a purpose but Dog & Bear is a just on a slightly different level because its been beautifully renovated and captures the essence of a true british pub with a few modern marks. Not sure what the other abd reviews are all about but they are kind of bogus.  Never had a bad time here and always going to come back.  One of the best pubs on the west end."}
{"text":"Let's start with the good: it's warm, they have a fireplace and the decor is straight out of the UK. Walking by on a -30 degree evening in February, this place looked pretty appealing.  Unfortunately $12 for the worst kale salad I have ever eaten, in a \"meal sized\" portion that wouldn't have even fed a rabbit, and a pitcher of Coors that was way WAY overpriced, I won't be back.."}
{"text":"Let's talk about the Dog and Bear Cobb Salad. I've been to the Cob Salad Rodeo more then once in my short but glorious existence, and let me tell you something; there are a lot of beautifully crafted salads in this diverse world of ours.   This was not one of them.   Imagine someone slamming a brick of cheese, a ham hock and a chunk of ice burg lettuce onto a plate with some sauce. That's pretty much what you get. One inch ham and cheese cubes circling the plate like a game of ring-around-the-Rosie. Lettuce that you have to chip at like the chunk of ice it's named after.   The ingredients of a salad should be as integrated as the beautiful Canadian Cultural Mosaic, not slammed down separately like a bunch of rugged...things...that totally don't hang out or aren't sliced thinly or whatever.   Also where's the egg and bacon?   Look just don't order the Cobb."}
{"text":"Friday night here at 9 pm was great! There was a crowd busily catching up with each other, with tables full of happy revellers enjoying good times. One table was playing some type of card game that looked fun, and that was nice to see as playing cards in bars was taboo not too long ago in Toronto the Good. We ordered some snacks which came promptly and went well with the lagers. I had a fish taco which hit the spot along with the onion rings which we nibbled on with quick service from our server. As the evening went on, the bar went from a typical Irish pub atmosphere with the big screens and beer flowing like water, to more of a nightclub with standing room only and patrons forced to have their drink while standing up which is fine for some, but not ideal for others. Seemingly slammed to over-capacity, there was a lineup out onto Queen Street as we left at 11pm. It was a squeezeingly good time getting out of there with the packed crowd along the bar."}
{"text":"This is probably my 5th or 6th time here. The service is never spectacular. Barely satisfactory. It has always felt like my sitting here spending money is more of a hindrance than a pleasure. I'm not a jerk. I just ask for the wifi password. And a beer. Not that they are in any way rude but I would like to be at least acknowledged. I am a very solid 20% tipper because I know it's generally warranted and right. I don't announce that. I just know it's what should be deserved. But when I come here I feel like I should tip between 10-15%. No more. And barely. I have come when it's not busy at all but I still really need to reach out to get a drink. No quality check or passing interest really. I even had one server give me that \"really, you want a drink?\" look. Ready to give me my bill after ONE. Like good god I threw off their game. How dare me. He planned his night, I just wasn't a part of it. I ordered that first drink now a second. I thought at first maybe it was the individual server and/or bartender (to be fair, the owner? ...or manager??? I don't know which, was good), which is why I have given it one too many chances, but, nope. I am the person who wandered into their home without an invitation saw booze and because it was an open door assumed I'd be welcome.  It's not like they don't seem like friendly people, just not to me. Or according to the reviews, anyone else.  ***the following paragraph was added later in the evening as well as amending my review from 2 stars to 1 star*************************  Oh in a REALLY WEIRD development, I was STILL working out my bill and trying to get my tip together and dude came over and grabbed the cash I had already placed on the bar (for the beer alone) like I was gonna run out on my super tiny bill. He SCOOPED the bills right in front of me. I barely had the paper transaction in front of me for maybe 2 minutes! I literally told him I was still working out my bill (meaning getting together a tip as I did not want to use plastic and was trying to find a toonie that I knew I had somewhere) and he kinda shook his head as if \"whatever\" and grabbed the money as if he couldn't do it fast enough or I may stiff him! I still had some of a pint to finish! So, seeing as I no longer needed to find more of a proper tip based on his reaction to me actually paying my bill, I stopped looking in my bag for that toonie right then and there and left what I had already put down, just above 10%. In hindsight however, I should've left nothing."}
{"text":"Nothing too crazy to say about this place, but they had seats for the Toronto vs. Montreal hockey game. That can be hard to find in the Annex. Their fries were pretty good too ($5). They also did separate bills. YAY!"}
{"text":"Don't eat here. The food is shit and gave me food poisoning. The beer was flat. Party was good, but that's it. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed having a beer at this spot. The interior decor is the best part of the experience with the exposed brick and dark wood and cozy booths. Pricing is more than fair for pints of beers and I definitely like how they do half pints for you As an option."}
{"text":"Atmosphere and Service very friendly, good for viewing sports events in a laid back way. Food was sub-par, had a bit of a shock to see that my calamari were swimming around in a pool of grease at the bottom of the basket. Service took it back and gave me a discount (20%). Will be back but not necessarily for the food."}
{"text":"I love coming here for a nice cold drink with my wife or to meet friends. I just love the layout of the place. I love the long bar and especially all the comfy booths. I've eaten here many times but I must say their food is not that great especially for the prices they charge. Saying that I still love coming here. It's laid back and it's right around the corner."}
{"text":"Pricey for the food we ordered which wasn't very good. Burgers were bland, wings were tiny, and the nachos tasted like cardboard. On the plus side, the atmosphere is really good and they have board games. We went on a Friday night around 9pm and it was really busy. If you choose to go here, go for the atmosphere, not the food."}
{"text":"This place is great if you love giant tempeh sandwiches with toasted bread that scrapes the top of your mouth off and salad you have to cut to eat, but if you're like me, it's not that big of a deal because you're still riding the high of the half fries half salad option because that's a dream come true where you can have your fries and eat salad too, so you don't really feel as bad as you might after eating a whole serving of fries but sometimes they still give you the same amount so you're really just hiding your shame under giant lettuce leaves but lettuce is mostly water so it's not that bad I guess, but the tempeh, the tempeh was kinda bland and drowning in too many sprouts but then again I'm never really impressed with tempeh and I need to accept the fact that I keep doing things I know I'm not gonna like and expecting different outcomes when I should have just gotten the fish tacos like the waitress said."}
{"text":"I went to Dog & Bear this afternoon to watch the Manchester United game. I'm not a soccer fan really, but he's a diehard United fan and it was his birthday. He wanted me to watch the game with him, and he suggested this pub since he had heard good things. I was expecting Brazenhead since he lives in Liberty and it's our favourite spot, but trying something new is always good.  We went in and it was fairly dead. We could see the staff fiddling with the AV package to get the soccer games on. They did, with the audio on the Man U game. Lovely. Our server brought us menus and asked for drinks. We were told that they didn't have Guinness at the moment (shame on you). Luckily, I saw Boneshaker on tap, possibly one of the best beers in existence.  Before I talk food, I wanna talk about the atmosphere. Weirdest thing I've ever encountered. The bar quickly filled moments into the game, groups of several people at a time, who seemed to all know eachother and hover around the bar. Literally everyone knew everyone. Cool, maybe lots of them work there or are regulars. The weirdest thing was when they'd occasionally pop behind the bar to pour themselves a beer, or to make lattes for them and their friends, etc. It was honestly the strangest thing ever and I'm still not certain about what was going on. It was fine though, and fun in a demented way.  The food was good. My buddy's girlfriend ordered a BBQ tempeh sandwich, and the server allowed her to swap out the tofu (the main point of the dish) which was especially accommodating of her. My friend ordered the fried chicken club, which he said was delicious. I ordered the philly steak & cheese sandwich, and it was very good, served in a very crisp roll to combat the tenderness/juiciness/cheesiness of the meat. All orders came with tasty pub-style fries on the side (smaller, with the skin on). Portion sizes on the fries were large, almost unnecessarily so.  Service was whatever. Totally fine, no complaints, but not terribly friendly or attentive. She was a tad distracted and more interested in the slew of people gathered near the bar that were staff, regulars, or some very strange hybrid.  But hey, I'll be back! The TV's were good, very good audio and a good crowd of people. Definitely a nice spot to watch 'that sporting event' of the day.   3.5/5"}
{"text":"Good service, fairly quick but the food was mediocre, especially the fries. The $12 pitcher of Steam Whistle was great though!!"}
{"text":"Oh goodness. We came here after finding a dearth of places that would fit 12 people for brunch. (yes, we were THOSE people).  We got in and it was pretty busy, as they were showing all the Sunday NFL games. But there was a lot of waitstaff and it seemed that everything took longer than it needed to... getting someone to take our order, getting our drinks, getting someone to take our order for food... as well, they ran out of brunch-type food at about 1:30pm on a Sunday, which is prime brunch time for the drinking set.  I really liked the ambiance, but what's the point if it takes so long to be served?"}
{"text":"Spent some time in here for dinner before a play across the street.  Dislike: the $5 beer special and a really good caesar salad.  Dislike: the server telling me I had to sit at the bar because the place gets busy when the game starts..in two hours (it was empty at the time).  Basically wouldn't serve me until I moved, and was slow (possibly on purpose) after that.  Wings were terrible."}
{"text":"We have always wanted to pop in since it opened so was looking forward to it.  Finally had the chance last night.  We initially were impressed by the space but not long after sitting down, realized how poorly planned the set up was.  Booths were smaller than they look.  There is a fireplace hidden by a huge table, where obviously one person would have a hot back.  Should have large upright chairs set up in front of the fireplace. THEN we are sat right in front of SEVEN huge TVs all showing the same football game.  Not long after getting our food, which was too salty and disappointing, the sound level on all the TVs was turned WAY TOO loud.  We had to ask them TWICE if they could turn it down because we couldn't hear each other at the table.  To top it off, the servers were all dressed inappropriately, with no professional attire, one person wearing a Mickey Mouse sweatshirt.  If you're a sports fan, wanting to watch a game and grab a beer, I guess this would be the place.  If you're looking for a good meal with friends, I would avoid this place."}
{"text":"Dog & Bear has your standard pub fare and is a good place to watch a game in the Queen West area.  Last time we went, we ordered the baja fish tacos, poutine and some nachos.  I find it pricier than others pubs and it can get too busy to the point you're left standing.  Also, they don't like you reserving a larger seating area if you're waiting for others to join you later.  It's definitely more of a sports bar than pub so it can get pretty loud if you just want to chat with friends.  Overall, I'd visit again to watch a game if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Went on a saturday and there was a good amount of people there and fairly priced drinks. Nothing spectacular for a bar in toronto on a friday night so its okay to go out with friends.  However, the manager of the bar is extremely rude and showed very little respect. He acted very arrogant and would push you out of his way and would instruct the bartenders who was allowed to be served first, I have never seen such an unprofessional manager in my life. All night the manager called the bouncers with his whistles and kicked multiple people. Not a friendly place at all and would not recommend going there.  It seems that you have to know someone who works there to have a good time or else the SERVICE IS HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"My friend moved the this neighborhood a few months ago and we came to visit him. We went to dog & bear the first two nights (including New Year's Eve) and had a great time. On January 1st my friends and I went to the raptor game and went back to the Dog & bear for a night cap. We were not drunk or out of control but the bartender refused to serve us, which was an obvious move because the bar was going to close in 40 minutes and she didn't want more work"}
{"text":"Toronto has a lot of generic pubs. You're always hoping to find one that is open in the afternoon for a pint and a bite and that actually hits above the usual mark. Dog & Bear unfortunately hits below.  This place has many kinds of beer, but there's no written list or chalkboard. The beer is the standard fare and the servers are happy to rattle off the entire list for you, which is only helpful if you're already familiar with the standard fare, suggesting that they await a very standard clientele. The beer cost is standard, too, the usual Queen West prices, in the $7 range plus tax. Don't expect any smashing happy hour deals, they're very fine-tuned. For instance, when we were there, the only one was a cheaper Ace Hill if you ordered the fish and chips.  The food menu is pretty basic and we were really hungry, but admittedly suspicious what kind of grub this place would turn out. We decided to try the plain veggie nachos, which were really terrible for $16 + tax, a big flat platter of chips with very sparse cheese and a shit-ton of iceberg lettuce strewn all over it, plus a smattering of jalapenos and a handful of wilted cilantro. We made a bit of a stink about the lack of dipping sauce and were told that we could purchase salsa as an add-on. We were sour-faced about it and our server offered to see the manager about some comped salsa for us, for which we were glad, as the nachos were not up to pub-food par. The food options are in the $15 to $20 range, which seems high if the offerings are as underwhelming as the nachos.  The beer is fine, it's beer, after all. If you're still unsure whether you are the kind of person who might want to drop in, note this detail: when we entered, The Final Countdown was blasting. When we left, it was Kenny Loggins' Danger Zone."}
{"text":"I went to this bar last weekend, it had only been open for one week.   Decor/Atmosphere:   It really has the makings of a decent sports bar, good number of screens dotted about the place. Hockey was playing when my friend and I entered. Quite dark inside, with \"romance candles\" (as our waitress called them) on each table. My friend and I stumbled upon this place by chance and both being British expats were curious to see this \"British Pub\". If I recall correctly there was a 'British Pub' theme to the decor. Mixed crowd in the bar, Queen West Hipsters, girly groups on nights out and the average Joe. It was fairly busy but is large sized bar so was very 'roomy'.   Service:  So many servers, we never had an empty glass. Very attentive and friendly! The server advised us that the bar had only opened the week before.   Food and drinks:   We were not going to eat, but the food looked pretty good. Fish and chips were pretty decent. Fish was crispy and coated in a beer batter (the way it should be!). The beer selection is not vast (ie I do not recall many British lagers) but they have only been open a week!  Price:  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. My friend and I shared fish and chips, drank a lot of alcohol (1 cocktails, 4/5 bar rails, 2 pints of lager) and our bill was about $70.    I will return soon to check this place out."}
{"text":"I got nice and tipsy here a few weeks ago while visiting Toronto with a few of my cousins.  It was a little louder than I would have liked but it's more of a bar for younger kids. I enjoyed playing Scrabble and drinking at a booth. (Yes, I know we're a bunch of nerds).  The drinks were not bad (the Guinness I had there was decently poured) and the price was reasonable.  Overall, the location wasn't bad and being able to play a board game was a nice touch.  I'd come back here the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Holy hipster.. the battered pickles are okay to munch on while having a beer.   Didn't order anything else from the menu, but the pickled eggs looked good.   Good number of screens to watch whatever, while sitting at the booths.  A really nice table by the window if you can snag it for people watching.   Service was not good the day we went in.  The server came over once, got our order of beer and pickles and returned to serve them, but she never stopped by again.  In fact no one stopped by.  We had to go to the bar and get more drinks ourselves. Even had to ask someone else for the bill b/c we didn't see the server until we left. Grrr.   It's an incredibly hipster place, which is fine by me, I guess. There were a lot of dudes there that day.  Good for single hipster girls I guess.  Don't know that I'll rush to go back. I liked the atmosphere and style of the place but b/c of the service I would rather go to Mezzrow's in Parkdale where the service is great and it's a MUCH shorter walk for me."}
{"text":"Nothing special. The interior has nice elements, it's industrial with exposed brick walls and flags hung up as decor, with some nice Xmas lights which I always enjoy. The decor made it feel cozy, however other elements destroyed that potential. $16 for an amaretto sour and a Strongbow is extremely overpriced. The music was not bad but honestly it was a bit too loud right off the bat, we couldn't even have a normal conversation and considering that this isn't a very \"danceable\" bar, because there's physically no room to move, having the music a bit lower to enjoy a conversation would've been nice. Their selection of drinks is decent but there is absolutely no food from what I understand? I must be wrong though, because if they serve alcohol they legally must provide food options, but with the level of service we got (or lack thereof) I was under the impression that they didn't even HAVE A menu. But regardless we were hungry and ended up getting pissed off and left early. I think this place has a lot of potential but there are things it needs to work on: overpriced drinks, food availability, service availability, and possibly constructing a specified dance area so that the DJ doesn't take up 2 tables for his setup and so that there is a designated area for people to dance (possibly the back corner could be repurposed for that) to reduce the serious congestion problem with this place. Won't be returning for a long time."}
{"text":"The vibe and atmosphere are great just come here to drink the food isn't great. The service is hit or miss depending on the server. Definitely come to the Dog and Bear on Friday or Saturday night for good party"}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game! Lots of beers - however, no sour options :(  The high tops don't have a hook, so ladies, it might be better to sit at the bar, or in the booth, if you want to set your purse down!   We ordered the Pear and Walnut salad, the Fish and Chips (sub cheese fries instead), and it was all really tasty.  We didn't expect the fish to be so large, so that was a great surprise! If you love jalapeños, the cheese goes well with it on the fries! Lots of walnuts came with the salad. It tasted nice and fresh!"}
{"text":"I'm mostly only here for breakfast: To watch early morning Football on the weekends (That's proper round ball, not pointy ball). Home to Toronto's Newcastle United supporters club and Toronto West Hammers.- Howay the lads!  The staff are super accommodating, sometimes opening as early as 7:30 for all the English PL games. And despite being up so early on the weekend, are pleasant enough and offer great service. There are about 10-12 TV's, and they have about 6 different cable boxes - If a game is televised anywhere on Canadian TV, they will be able to put it on  The breakfast is excellent, and many healthy options which is a great alternative to the usual grease fest. Personal favorite is the 'egg in a hole'  The beer is great too. 8-10 different taps with some classic English pub ales and a local favorite - Left Field Brewing.  Finally, the place is always super clean and the decor is very nice. Equal parts modern, and old english pub style."}
{"text":"Service was quick and efficient, top notch!  We got there around 9 and the place was half full. We ordered some beers, they had Amsterdam Boneshaker but not much else for hops.   My friend got a Guinness because it was the only dark draft they had.   We had a nice corner booth so it was loud or in the middle of anything.  A bit after 10pm it got really busy and the crowds started getting louder and louder. We had a birthday party of about 15 people show up right next to our table and was dancing erratically... to very low music.... lol time to leave :)"}
{"text":"I liked this place! It wasn't very busy when I went in so we sat in the window. The server was very friendly and attentive. I got the BBQ tempeh club which was crazy, sooooo messy to eat but really tasty. Probably not a good idea that I was sitting in the window but I didn't know how messy it would be! Anyway just be aware of that when sitting in the window. Pints of the beer on special were $5 until 7 even on a saturday so I'm into that."}
{"text":"4 stars as a bar, I always come here after 10pm so I've never had the food. I also miss it when it used to the The Social, but the Dog and Bear as a bar is great. On weekend nights the front has tables and booths to sit at and at the back is a small dance floor with hip hop. The seats are usually taken but theres plenty of space to stand around. There is also no place to put your jacket so people just leave them against the wall. The dance floor is always fun and can get packed. The crowd is a good mix mostly people in their 20s and early 30s, and casual attire, no need to get dressed up, and not too many creepy dudes. The music is loud, drinks are reasonably priced and there can be a short line outside sometimes but not ever more than 10 minutes to get in, but I always have a good time."}
{"text":"I really like Dog and Bear. I've been quite a few times. I like the vibe of the place. I like the music on Saturdays (throw back to 2000s hip hop). The place gets PACKED so you have to get there really early. There is a long bar when you enter on one side and on the other side are a bunch of booths. There's board games there too, although I've never seen anyone playing them. At the back to the left there's a tiny dance floor. I think it was about $10 for a pint of Beau's. 9$ for wine."}
{"text":"An alright place for a beer. Food isn't all that good. The wings were way too salty and breading on the fish of my fish and chips were too thick and not cooked through... it was a doughy mess. Also, I tried to order a margarita on the rocks and they told me I can't because they don't have the mix. Ummm... you don't need a freaking mix to make margaritas. All you need is tequila, fresh lime juice, and triple sec - really basic stuff. So yeah, it was disappointing.   Oh yeah, I just remember that all their beer glasses were dirty.. lipstick marks on rim. So I deducted another star."}
{"text":"Came here after a TFC game with a buddy and I had higher expectations about the food.  The menu is pretty limited and the food came out salty.  I will come back...to drink."}
{"text":"Watched the Jays game last night. Being from WQW, I decided to drop in to watch the game because they probably have the best screens between dufferin and dovercourt on queen.   It's a decent place if you just want to dig in on food and alcohol, but it can get crowded which makes it difficult to establish a spot."}
{"text":"The vibe: A cozy pub on West Queen West that kinda turns into a bar at night.   The food: The food is the worst part of this place. The drink and beer menu is great. They stock loads of local craft beers on tap and the service is friendly. The food is so-so. The burger is definitely the best thing on the menu. I didn't really like their nachos or wings. I feel like they should perfect those items. It's a pub!  My go to meal: Burger with half and half salad and fries.  Secret: There's a great little back room that you can rent out for parties."}
{"text":"I usually don't mind this place. Food is pretty good, they show sports etc bit last night I was there with 2 other friends. I went to the bar to get us drinks and the bar man told me there was a minimum 4 drink purchase to use a credit card or debit card. We had been there for a few hours with a bigger group of people. No one had ever said this to our table. Is this even legal? Surely it's a minimum spend if anything?? I told him I would take a water and he just laughed and processed my 3 drink payment (over $20). I went back to my table and my friend said they same thing  happened to him so he just paid cash. It didn't seem right...even if that is policy, it's not a good one"}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed when walking into this place is the amount of work that was put into the renovations. Compared to the layout of the Social, these guys didn't settle for keeping the bar in the same location and moved it to the other side. A major overhaul that helps me dismiss the Dog & Bear as \"the Social is now a pub.\"  There aren't many good spots to watch sporting events downtown so I welcome any place that puts the effort into investing in HD televisions for watching baseball, hockey, etc. They don't have a massive big screen anywhere, but they do have about six fair-sized screens around the venue. Unfortunately the night I came there was a postponed baseball event so I never got to stick around to feel the vibe of watching some sporting action.  Instead they had an overly British playlist running through the speakers. Stuff like the Beatles, Oasis, Pulp, the Clash, etc. A quick look around and there's portraits of King George and Queen Victoria, as well as random Union Jack flags. I'm half British and I love all things pub-like and England, but this seemed far from authentic. The whole \"we're trying to be a British pub\" thing doesn't fly with me. It's okay to be a pub in Toronto. Put up some Blue Jays and Maple Leaf memorabilia maybe?  My server was lovely and polite. We got our drink orders in no time, but was a little disappointed in the tap selection for beer. I opted for the fish & chips and they were actually quite tasty. The fish melted in my mouth, and the fries were a good flavourful pairing. Coleslaw was a bit on the KFC tip, but not complaining. I had a couple of my friend's chicken wings, which were also good. Everything seemed reasonably priced.  I didn't feel the hipster levels were particularly high. I think I could get used to watching sports here any day of the week. I wasn't too keen on the bill coming out in a book though -- would definitely scrap that idea and stick with a tray."}
{"text":"Looks like a solid, old pub which would be fun for St Patty's Day or something. Lots of TVs to watch sports which was nice when we were there. I didn't eat, but had several beers.  The service was good."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday night, place was packed for raptors and leafs game. Service was not good, waitress barely came to our table, had to get drinks at the bar at one point because she was no where to be found.   Otherwise the atmosphere was nice, tame crowd, and food was decent, although it's my first time seeing radish put on nachos"}
{"text":"Service was okay and fairly quick (although they were not busy when I went).  Food was.... Well, I left most of it on my plate (which I never do).   My dining partner had the nachos, which were almost burnt and toppings portions were minimal.  I had the Cobb salad with \"grilled\" chicken... I hope the d&b owner sees the following suggestions and revamps the salad: -the salad came on a \"bed\" of ice berg lettuce. Which was really half a head of lettuce cut into quarters and put on the plate. I couldn't cut it into bit-sized pieces, and I also questioned how sufficiently my was washed, given that it was presented in two chunks on my plate. Would it be too difficult to tear up some lettuce, properly wash it, and put it on a plate? -the cheddar cheese was cut into chunks and put on the plate. Was super awkward trying to cut into more reasonable pieces to eat with the salad. PLEASE consider grating the cheese!!! -the \"grilled\" chicken. Sigh. The chicken on my plate was paler than Lilith on Cheers, and had zero flavour. Pretty sure it comes to the restaurant cooked and they reheat it, or they cook it in the microwave. The chicken on my plate definite never saw a grill. Barely edible- zero flavour, weird texture, and super dry.   Sorry, but I won't be back... I know d&b is known as a sports bar, but in addition to the nachos I've also had the wings and fish and chips in the past... Neither impressed. There are better places to watch the game, with both better atmosphere and better tasting food..."}
{"text":"My dodgeball team and I ended up here for a post-season brunching. We wandered our way down from Ossington and Dundas trying to find a place that could fit 12 people on a Sunday. Not an easy task but we did end up somewhere.  There seemed to be lots of staff on board, but the service was less than good. Things took forever. The brunch menu is very British and also small. Of the options, they were out of the two things I tried to order. I still managed to find something, but it was a little hard with both hands tied behind my back.  Maybe this is growing pains, maybe not. I won't be back for a while."}
{"text":"Location is great. On one of the main strips \"queen st\" and was very close to our suite.   Service was great. Our server was very helpful and constantly made sure we had what we needed at the right time and they kept the place very clean and sleek.  Only downside was the food. I went with the bangers \"sausage\" and they were extremely dry and just did not taste normal I ended up tossing the whole meal. My wife had a fish sandwich though not great she was ok with it. Drinks were great. Really wish the food was on par with everything else."}
{"text":"I had a late late late supper tonight at the Dog & Bear, which is in our 'hood.  It was jammed and I was able to get a table by the window.  Yay!  I ordered Buffalo wings (there were seven to a pound for $12) and fries.  They were good!  Just after 11pm, my server demanded I pay my bill immediately because the \"music\" (ie DJ) was starting.  So with ketchupy fingers, I took care of it.  I wasn't offered another beer nor were the baskets which my food been served in removed.  So I wasn't crazy about the service.  I guess I'm not one of the kool kids."}
{"text":"Pretty good Toronto pub dishing out standard pub-fare with a cool west-end vibe. Wings hit the mark, the burgers are on point, and they run some drink specials on weekdays. Dependable place to catch the game, and there's usually a good buzz on the weekends."}
{"text":"If you like hip hop you have to go here on the weekends. My roommate loves this place, but I personally didn't have the best experience. We waited in line for 40 minutes and almost froze to death. Then we got in, I could not hear anyone's voice."}
{"text":"I went here last week to help celebrate a friend's birthday. Cool laid back casual crowd of 20 to 30 people. Good beer selection and fast and friendly bar staff. I didn' t here so I can't comment on the food. Music was good but not too loud so you can still have a conversation, and there are tvs so you can keep track of the sporting events that are on. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by one of our friends, we wanted to go here one night but it was super packed so we went to a different bar.   We came here a bit early to grab a quick bite to eat and some drinks. After our food came, the place quickly began to get crowded with people. I love the vibe and atmosphere of the place. The food was also delicious and service was impeccable!   Definitely will come here again just to hang out and have drinks."}
{"text":"Super noisy! Very very crowded, not a place where you can just walk in for drinks you need to be buzzed and willing to stand. My experience was OK"}
{"text":"A pretty popular pub at the west end of the city.  The street car practically stops right at the front of the establishment which makes for an evening of safe socializing and drinking. When i entered the pub, it was packed.  The waitress told us to grab whatever seats that became available.  So this became a fight between groups of people in search of a table to sit down.   Eventually we found a place to sit down.  We ordered pints of beer and food.  I decided on fish and chips (approx $14) and the service was pretty fast. The fish was nicely battered, but the fries were nothing to brag about.   Overall it's a nice place to hang out.  Everyone there was going crazy over a hockey game on tv, so the ambiance was quite jovial."}
{"text":"Hipster Cornucopia Alert. Level: Red.   So I had just left dodgeball (ya heard), and me and my dodgeball team (!) made our way to the Lakeview to get brunch. There were 12 of us, so we knew we weren't getting in, but we tried.  Then we just kept walking, slowly towards The Drake, and somehow ended up in the place formerly known as The Social. We should have gone to The Drake.   They were busy, and really weren't prepared. They were out of eggs, sausage and mayonnaise. What? Right. Ok. Mac and cheese and fried pickles? Cool. It was fine, but a bit bland, and the overall experience was pretty crappy. It's a big place, they should staff more servers (all ridiculously good looking grrrls, bee tee dubs, boys), and you know... buy enough effing groceries.  PEPPER'S PATS HERSELF ON THE BACK: I played a sport.   10/30"}
{"text":"I merely like this pub for what it is attempting to do. It's definitely trying to be British but it can't authentically pull it off. It's a solid effort but a miss. I like the huge booths, also the look of the interior and their draft beer always tastes good. For some reason, their draft Guinness tastes amazing here. The food is also dependable. The menu is small but everything is hearty and carb-y. Their deep fried pickles are tasty and is a total bang for your buck. Wings are decent and their main courses are yummy. Everything is reasonably priced and the service has alway been acceptable.  It's not necessarily my most favourite pub but it's more reasonably priced than other places in the vicinity.   It's a dependable, run-of-the-mill pub and it's worth going to if you happen to be in the area."}
