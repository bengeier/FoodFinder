{"text":"So my family and I went to Franos after crossing off other restaurants in town. We looked online at their menu and it looked good with great prices. Their website was not updated to reflect their current prices (that have gone up due to the price of food in general as we all know). The service was great and attentive, it is a true family resto. Their kids were sitting at the bar having dinner, Maria was serving us and her husband is chef! The food was amazing! Fresh, homemade Italian fare! And their prices reflect that - if you want cheap go to Boston Pizza or East Side Mario's where the microwave is used more than the stove. This place is the real deal with decent portions and prices to boot! I would def recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little Italian resturant located in Town. The food is fantastic and all home made. You can order take out or eat in. Great for lunches or a relaxed dinner. I have tried the calzone, calamari and alfredo. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I told my Yelp friend I want PIZZA! Yes we are in Stouffville but I want real Italian Pizza! And my Yelp app told me to go to Frano's! 

Parking was quite limited during lunch, not because the restaurant was busy. The parking lot is really small and shared with other business in the same strip mall. 

We were the only table here for lunch on this sunny afternoon. The food here is really good! As authentic as one you can find in the area. We ordered:

Mini Arancini (7.00) with cheese served with side of bolognese sauce

Pizza Frano ($16) sauce, fior di latte, prosciutto, arugula, shaved parmigiano and olive oil

The wait time might be the reason that no one was here for lunch. It did take quite awhile for my food to arrive. Maybe they should have a quick and simpler lunch menu?

I was in a carb coma and just could not eat dessert but I know what I am going to order next time when I have here! Papa Dough (fried pizza dough sprinkled with sugar and covered with Nutella and toasted hazelnuts)!"}
