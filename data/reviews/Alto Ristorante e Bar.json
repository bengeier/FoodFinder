{"text":"This place was great. Mushroom ravioli and lobster linguini were amazing. Check for coupons online - we found one that we showed to our friendly waiter on the phone. Also, free Gondola rides with dinner."}
{"text":"The Italian food was terrible.  I ordered pasta, it was NOT homemade.  It was overcooked and mushy.  The tomato sauce had too much salt.  Way overpriced.  It was dark and dank, in a lower level.  The waitstaff kept interrupting our conversation and stood there so we couldn't continue speaking to each other.  I got eaten up by mosquitos, and today I am still itching profusely.  We ate indoors, but mosquitos were everywhere.
To top it off, I valeted my car.  When I returned my car, the seats, mirrors, radio and AC was changed.  I have never had a valet do this before.  I will not return to this pricy establishment in the near future unless they rectify their wrongs in the restaurant.  I usually dine at the Sanctuary, where everything is first rate."}
{"text":"Ok I gave this place a 4 star for their food, the chef was obviously ambitious, and  thats more than I can say for the wait staff. We came in knowing we'd be a problem since 2 of the people in our group were vegan, anyway it took like 15 minutes for us to get the guy in line for what vegan meant. This lack of knowledge luckily wasn't shared by the chef they both had great meals and had no problems. My food was great I started with the scallops for my appetizer, they were almost perfectly pan seared and tasty. It was served with this kind off sweet sauce, which I like but I'm sure it's not for everyone. Then I had the roasted duck I've had duck before and I liked it, I love the flavor-fulness of it and I'm a fan of the texture so I thought why not get it again. I was glad I did it was tender and juicy and flavorful, they do all their duck medium rare and that was fine with me since I had no real basis to which I would know the amount of rarity I would want for my duck. Then came dessert I had the gondola, which was just creme bule with a cookie like model of a gondola on top. Their creme bule with berries on top, superb. This place was kinda cheesy and they called themselves the Venice of the West....hardly, but regardless of ill fit names they had all around great food, service was touch and go but in the end its the food that counts."}
{"text":"Restaurant week prompted us to try a hotel's fare, which usually we avoid. Being frequent diners at Valley fine restaurants, we checked the menu online and headed out.  I'd like to give praise for all the personnel, who, from the hostess to the Assistant F&B Director, were gracious and knowledgeable.  That was the only superior component of our experience.  The food was typical hotel offerings: I had the 1st course 3 meat meatballs, which were marginal at best. The fresh tomato based sauce was good. My husband had the lobster appetizer, and pronounced it mediocre. My ahi was good, but nothing special. I had asked that it be cooked more, and they obliged. I've had better at most Asian Valley restaurants for 1/2 the price. My husband said his ahi, which was more under cooked, was good. The cheesecake could have been Sara Lee, although spiffed up with edible flowers. The wine selection was good, the required valet was $8; to add to the annoyance were 6 tour buses which blocked access for several minutes. From now on we will let the tourists enjoy Alto's. Sad, because the Hyatt Gainey Ranch is gorgeous, especially the bar.  I forgot to mention the other diners were turned out in a variety of clothing suitable for yard work: old tee shirts, shorts, Mom jeans, baseball caps-there should be a dress code for the restaurant. Under arm hair displayed during fine dining leaves one wishing they were somewhere else like Vincent's or Kai.  Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Did not meet expectations. 

Ambience: Pleasant and relaxing. Sat outside with a view of the pool and palms. No excessive noise or disturbances, and table was nicely lit. As we ate here on a Friday evening, the adjacent bar had live music. The bluesy guitar and drum-driven sets echoed nicely, without drowning out our conversation. I'll add it seems very worthwhile to come for just a drink and the live music.

Drinks: Our Cakebead Chardonnay was well-handled. 

Service: Our waiter was very competent but over-extended. For the first part of our meal, he seemed to have too many tables. He arrived to do one lengthy explanation of the menu, which was adequate. Our food was hot when received. To his credit, he went out of his way to replace a suboptimal cut. When faced with this concern, he didn't get defensive, and focused immediately on rectifying the situation, which was the perfect approach. He was a very good server, and with a slightly more formal attitude commensurate with the venue's price point, would have been an excellent server.

Food: Appetizer clams were the highlight. Buyer's remorse upon receiving our 16oz ribeyes at a restaurant with an Italian name. While I prefer the tenderness of a tenderloin or strip, I'll spring for an adequate ribeye. Though my medium-rare was cooked just right, the cut was lacking in quality. Presence of pesto on the meat was confusing, but easily spooned away. The barbecue-type sauce on the side was flavorful - the piece's highlight, which helped mask the cut's suboptimal quality. And skip the antipasto. Aside: waiter explained the venue used to instead feature an 8oz strip (instead of our 16oz ribeye). If management opts not to purchase higher-quality ribeyes, it should consider going back to strips (though the former 8oz was surely too small - consider instead a 10oz strip). Restaurants at other nearby resorts have much better steaks at the same price point.

Gondola: Apparently, a reservation at Alto includes passes to the Hyatt's gondola. The gondola is a short walk past the adjacent bar. We weren't even aware of the gondola until our waiter said he'd enclose passes with our bill. The gondolier was pleasant, and a very talented singer (he'll sing a \"Neapolitan folk song\"). But the experience screamed cheap gimmick. The ride was 15 minutes total. There weren't any \"grounds\" located off the water to showcase - we got to a water slide, then turned around at a bridge about six minutes in. The path brings you back the same way you came! The singing is probably timed to distract from this realization, but the effect was lost on me. I wouldn't ordinarily complain so much about a complimentary experience, but we were expecting much better! (It baffles me that someone would pay for this if he were without free passes!). If you have kids with you, or enjoy tacky spectacles, this might be something you'd enjoy.

In sum, my advice is to come for the drinks and live music on a weekend (possibly an appetizer as well), and skip the gondola."}
{"text":"The antipasti chef's selection was out of this world. We each had a pasta dish, both were delicious. The view is great. The service was painfully slow, but it looked like maybe they were understaffed or didn't organize larger reservations well."}
{"text":"Very good service here! We also enjoyed our food. The antipasti was delicious! We also enjoyed the butternut squash with crab soup, salmon, and raviolis. Would return again! Oh, and a bonus is that you get a free gondola ride after. :)"}
{"text":"Went for dinner for my moms birthday! Had the fried eggplant  and the bone in rib eye. Food was good. We had gone to the bar and ordered some drinks then we were given the option to cash out and pay or transfer the bill. We chose to pay but then after we were seated and tried to Order the same drink (wine), they told us we could no longer get that same wine. However the waiter still received his drinks from that same bar. We just felt it then forced us to order the cheapest bottle as an alternative which was 60 dollars. 
Service was great! Jeremy was very nice and knowledgable. 
Very pricy but definitely enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"When you look at the price you pay you expect more.  My wife and I found the food quality above average but the food taste on the bland side.  The food sounded good and interesting when the waiter described the food to us.  We did like the Antipasta and the dessert.  The dessert was comped since it was our wedding anniversary"}
{"text":"Horrible food and service don't waste your money, there's much better in Scottsdale for less money. Went there during summer and had some great food. I liked it so much I returned with my boy friend the second time on Halloween. The menu had changed and it was terrible food, also bad service. I was looking forward to going on the complementary gondola ride but it was not offered by the server???. After paying 160.00 for dinner that I did not eat because the food was so bad, I was a little upset so I called to tell the manager that the food was bad and their new menu was terrible and to ask about the gondola ride. I spoke to a guy who said he was manager of another restaurant there and the manager would call me, no one ever called. Save yourself a disappointing evening and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Dined here on 12-29-16 & was pleasantly surprised.  Many years ago I used to come here once in a while and the decor & ambiance was always great but the food was sub par.  So impressed with the improvements in the food these days.  I had the Filet Mignon with the truffle marsala and I wish I didn't have to say this but this might be the softest and most flavorful filet mignon I ever had in my life.  I actually asked the waiter \"is this prime?\"  I mean, how did they get it so butter soft?  My fiance had the Sea Bass special and it was really great, it had some sort of crispy marmalade thing on it that was just awesome, even my 2-year old ate it.  Music was pleasant, lobster risotto was good, bread was warm and fresh, drinks were interesting.  Drink menu is presented on an I-pad.  Ha.  I must be getting old.  And of course you get a free Gondola ride at the end, and David the gondalier had a surprisingly good voice, really professional version of \"O Sola Mia.\"  Not sure how anyone is giving this place less than 4 stars, must be they had a rough night or maybe they are just WAY too picky.  For me, the service was very professional, the decor of course fantastic, the food outstanding, the free Gondola ride is just over the top.  I'd recommend this place to anyone.  You can arrive 30 minutes early and just walk around the grounds.  I would recommend coming before it gets dark so you can see the beauty of the grounds.  Great job guys.  I don't get out much so when I do it's special and you did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Last night I took my husband here for his birthday. I have been to the hotel before to enjoy the live music and bar but have never eaten at Alto. This was one of the most amazing meals we have ever! The atmosphere was enjoyable. Our waiter Jay was very friendly and attentive without hovering or being pestering. We asked him for a recommendation for a wine. He brought us two samples and we ordered Cain. It was a great red blend. We started the meal with antipasti. We ordered a brigante cheese, arrabbiata bruschetta, grilled asparagus with herbed bread crumbs and gorgonzola and olives. All of which were amazing. For our entrees my husband ordered the duck breast and I ordered the rack of lamb. The duck was very good but the rack of lamb was to die for! Every bite melted in my mouth and I did not want the sensation to end. I truly believe no one could have been unsatisfied with this entree. If all that was not enough they brought out creme brûlée for my husbands birthday. This was the most delicious dessert I have ever had. We scraped the bowl clean. This was possibly the best meal I have had and will definitely be back. There were many other appetizing options on the menu I don't think I would want to change my order. Although my husband might end up ordering the lamb as well. I ended up having to share some of mine with him. If we were not celebrating his birthday that might not have happened. After the meal they gave us two certificates for their gondola rides. It was a gorgeous evening and being on the lake was a wonderful experience. We were serenaded my a man who had the most wonderful voice. The entire evening was perfect and the most romantic date I have ever been on. I would HIGHLY recommend this experience!"}
{"text":"We went to Alto for my mom's birthday. The server was very knowledgeable and all of her recommendations were spot on. They treated my mom like a Queen and made sure she had a fantastic experience. The food was very good, good wine selection and excellent service. Nice outdoor seating option when it's not summer.  Plus, mom got the added bonus of the Hyatt's gondola ride and birthday serenade."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located in the back part of the Hyatt. The wait staff was very friendly.
We ordered an antipasti arrangement and everything was delicious. I also couldn't leave without some dark chocolate gelato for dessert."}
{"text":"Delightful dinner.Excellent food, and great service from Chris. Thanks to Chris for the tickets to the gondola ride. Perfect end to perfect dinner by warm fire on a cool night under the palm trees."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Hotel for our Wedding Anniversary. All of our food was excellent and our server was also very good. He was attentive without being intrusive and we enjoyed our meal and drinks (excellent martini). The ambiance is a bit sterile for my tastes, but it didn't detract from the good food and service."}
{"text":"I just want to say I like this place a lot!

Very nice location, surrounded by water and greens, you won't feel like you're in the desert. Food is always great and flavorful, my favorites are the Fettuccine Bolognese and the Salmon Con Caponata. And complementary Gondola Rides? Yes!!!

And the price is very reasonable!"}
{"text":"The best steak that I've had in years. Cooked perfectly, tender, and juicy. And the pesto sauce on top was amazing! The lamb is also fantastic. Service was great, the staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. Nice atmosphere, the patio outside has a firepit and nice outdoor seating. The restaurant is towards the back of the hotel, there was live music in the entry area of the hotel, but you couldn't hear it in the restaurant. It's a bit pricey, but the food is worth it. We plan on visiting again on our next date night. Definitely recommend for a quite dinner out!"}
{"text":"Maybe I'm being a bit harsh with this two star review, but I was not impressed. I went with a party of 4 and we had reservations at 6pm. We all ordered the chef's special, which includes 4 courses. Each course was the tiniest thing ever. We didn't order any appetizers because we thought a 4 course meal would actually be a 4 course meal.  The proportions were horrible. They started us off with literally a shot of tomato soup. Next we had the tiniest salad in the world. A small portion of cod, some weird roasted duck thing (smelled horrible) and lastly some cheesecake contraption at the end. Our bill came out to be $332, for absolutely no food. My party and I were still hungry afterwards. My date and I, after the gondola ride, went to in n out and had a $10 meal that was better than what we paid $300 for. At least in n out filled me up, and didn't put such a giant dent in my wallet.

Overall, if you're into super eclectic fancy food, go for the chef's special priced at a ridiculous $65 per person. 

Maybe if we had all ordered something instead of the chef's special, we would've enjoyed it more. My date and I are not a fan of seafood and our waiter/chef didn't ask what we liked or if anyone had any allergies or anything. The chef's special is random and whatever the chef wants to make, but it should at least adhere to the parties taste. 

Good things, though. The gentleman refilling drinks (not the waiter) was super attentive. My drink never got below half full. He was probably the best part of dinner."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here last night to celebrate our third wedding anniversary. We chose to do the tasting menu which is not well highlighted on the menu, but is a fabulous choice! I opted to do wine pairings with it as well. 

We began with a mushroom puree as a palatee cleanser. Our first course (paird with a Pinot Grigio) was a fig and heirloom tomato salad with a honey balsamic vinagarette. This was followed by succulent salmon with a mango type chutney (paired with a blush rose wine). There was a bit of a wait for the next entree but it was well worth it! Fresh made potato gnocchi with truffle oil. If you have never had truffle oil it is intoxicating. I have NEVER had anything so delicious in my life. Our final entree course was duck breast with apricot chutney (paired with a Caberbet). We finished this amazing tasting menu with a sampling of four dessert- chocolate type cake, oil olive cake, lemon cheesecake, and fresh berries and mango (paired with a dessert Pinot)

Overall, the meal was AMAZING. Our waiter was extremely knowledge and I not only walked away with a much better understanding of wine pairings and the wine making process, but I also recived a great lecture on the ins and outs of truffles. Interesting fact: the most expenseive truffle ever sold was at an auction. That volleyball sized truffle sold for $250,000. But I digress, the most important thing in this review is that if you have not been here, it is a Must-go!"}
{"text":"We went here while staying at the Hyatt. We didn't expect much because it was just a restaurant in the hotel, but we were presently surprised. 

I ordered the cheese board, Caesar salad, and the pasta special. The cheese board was fantastic. They cut everything fresh and have a wonderful selection. This was good enough to come back just for cheese & wine. The Caesar salad was also very good. It was very traditional Italian, which is hard to find. The pasta we really enjoyed. It was fresh with a nice sauce. The service here was also great!

After eating here they also give you passes for the gondola ride, which is fun for after dinner!

We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Went on a Friday evening as a kick-off to 1 yr wedding anniv. Entrance and grounds/lounge of resort are beautiful in the evening. Great spot for drinks or appetizers. The restaurant is off to the side, feels disconnected from gorgeous grounds. Decor, front patio seem subpar for the resort. Back patio of dining area nicely lit, scant decor, so-so chairs and tables. Def a downgrade from rest of resort area. Can hear pool falls but largely enclosed by tall shrubs, minimal view. Server (Travis?) excellent. Food decent. Heavy like most of Phx rest's, overly oiled/buttered. Crab pasta soo heavy, salmon cool in the middle and had same sauce as our bruchetta app's!? Lazy and not much innovation on the plate. Love Phx but rest's are way behind.."}
{"text":"Had an amazing dinner with my family. They have a new chief from Puerto Rico who was hired on a month ago and just introduced a new menu. WoW! Tonight I had the duck, the best.  Apps were great too. I highly recommend.  They have really stepped it up."}
{"text":"We were impressed!  The attention to detail regarding food and service showed, right down to the selection of uber quality olives.  Those and the cured meat, along with their fantastic rustic bread and super premium olive oil started us as we enjoyed Italian whites by the glass.  We moved on to a Montepulciano d'Abruzzo to accompany our rabbit papperdelle and lamb.  OMG, the food was delicioso!  The exquisite quality truly reminded us of Italy, where the food is simple but sings with flavor.  If there were kinks, it's that we found the decor/chairs/linens too 'hotel standard' and lacking in charm.  And a little more value on the wine list would be nice. Oh well. Kiley, our server, balanced warmth with professionalism, even as we continued on to one more glass of wine.  What can I say - the evening was gorgeous on that patio, the palms trees were lit with romance and, just like when we're in Italy, we simply did not want the experience to end.  Kudos to Chef for impeccably executed cuisine and kudos to management for obviously creating a superior service atmosphere. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The service was good.  The food was average.  It was very expensive (to us).  They give you free passes for the gondola, which is nice."}
{"text":"Found this place from restaurant.com - I would suggest printing a certificate because this a pricey place and you will want to try the antipasti and dessert !
First, let me mention the one negative part of my experience.  We made an early reservation for 5:30 (the restaurant opens at 5:30).  When we arrived there was only one table seated in the whole place but we still had to wait 15 minutes for our table!  In the meantime the two girls manning the reservation table spent the time talking to each other. 
Luckily, the experience got better once we were seated. Drinks and bread came quickly and we started with the antipasti - we choose cheese variety, deli meats, olives, and fruit spread. It all sounds basic, but was so yummy and flavorful when it arrived. It was a meal in itself (5 stars for this portion)
For dinner we ordered crab linguine, three other ordered the tuna special of the day, and the hubby ordered the steak.  He made the best choice, the other dishes were fair/good.  Nothing to scream about, but all edible enough so no complaints (3 stars here).
Even though we were full we opted to share the \"house special\" dessert of the gondola bowl. It's a cute creme brulee with fruit, sauce, and a chocolate gondola on top.  It is a large dish so I would suggest sharing.  As creme brulees go I would rate it above average because of the added sauce (3.5 to 4 stars)
Overall I rated it 4 stars, even though I was considering 3, since the Hyatt is a beautiful pace, the waitstaff is super attentive as there is a dedicated waiter and bus boy for the table, and the meal comes with...drumroll.....a complimentary gondola ride!  There is a lake at the back of the property and they take you out for a 15-20 minute ride, including a singing gondolier!  What a great topper !!"}
{"text":"Really tasty with terrific service!!!!!  Great ambiance with a great menu! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"The fiance took me here for my birthday dinner last week and we had a great time! It is located at the Hyatt hotel so the ambience is just amazing and beautiful. There is a nice outdoor dining area with a fire pit but it was drizzling a bit so we decided to eat indoors. There were a good number of parties for a Wednesday evening but not overly crowded so our dinner still felt intimate and special. Service was pleasant and positive all throughout.

We started off our dinner with an order of bruschetta which were good in size and great in flavor. I ordered the lobster linguini and the fiance ordered the capellini with crab. Umm..can I just say that our pastas were dee-lish! I loved the lobster in my linguini but I had to steal my fiance's plate because I loved the pesto sauce in his capellini even more. Luckily, my fiance didn't mind because he devoured the rest of my linguini without complaint. 

We ended the dinner with a very yummy creme brulee that they provided to us for my birthday. It was the cutest darn thing complete with a gondola on top. It would have been the perfect segue into the actual gondola ride but we were unable to experience it due to the weather. However, we did receive vouchers so that we can go back for the romantic gondola ride sometime in the near future.

It's a pricey place but the food is great so coming here for a special occasion is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Visited on  a Thursday evening.
Pros - We had great service from Philip and Shaun, both were very attentive, funny and engaging without being intrusive. 
The generous \"bread basket with sticks\" were excellent - served with a dish of balsamic and a dish of olive oil. 
The filet was fork tender, flavorful and cooked exactly as ordered. The swordfish was superb, in terms of texture it was the best I've ever had...but for me, a little over salted. 
The creme brulee was excellent, generous enough in its portion size to be more than enough for two. It's served in a large oval dish with a \"gondola\" inspired design including a \"cookie gondola\" fresh berries and a miniature chocolate gondola pole/paddle. 
The squash soup was excellent. 
The Hyatt property has \"gondola canals\" and offers gondola rides to patrons. We were presented with complimentary \"tickets\" at the end of our meal. I wouldn't call this a \"mediterranean\" restaurant but I regard menu items such as mushrooms, carrots, artichokes etc as not uniquely Italian so for those so inclined, it does serve some mediterranean style dishes. 

Cons - one of the filets was ordered with \"sauce on the side\" but was served with the filet and sauce together (serving staff, other than Philip, brought the food to the table). Philip spotted it (without being told) when he checked on us and got it fixed. 
The water glasses are small, similar to the glass usually used for an \"old fashion\" ... so if you're a \"water drinker\" as am I, you'll be needing constant refills. 
We were provided with a \"parking validation\" ticket to use at the parking lot exit machine...it didn't work, needed to insert my credit card."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food. I highly recommend veal cheeks ravioli and pork belly.
Lisa was wonderful and went above and beyond in giving us tips on where to go and what to do while visiting. She served us on both nights and truly made the experience. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant I've ever been to. The food was amazing!  I definitely would recommend this place to everyone for dinner, lunch, breakfast, and vacation. The spa pool for family party's great place for birthdays there is nothing more special than this place!"}
{"text":"Generally...disappointing. Portions were small.  My tagliatelle dish had hardly any pasta. Their ravioli dish likewise was sparse.  Food was not served hot...barely warm.  They should have used hot plates.  Broccolini  side dish was barely cooked, almost raw.  While service and ambiance were OK and the gondola ride is quite nice, I was there for a meal and I left disappointed and hungry."}
{"text":"We were staying at the resort for the weekend and had no car the first night so we chose this place. The service was a little too frequent and the prices a little too high but what do you expect at a hotel restaurant? The food was pretty good and the ambiance was nice. The gondola ride for free was an added bonus. If you're staying here this is the place to eat.."}
{"text":"I had the truffle filet and it was easily the best steak I've ever had. My husband had a pasta dish and even though the pasta is handmade it wasn't anything to write home about. I also had wasn't crazy about the ambiance and the service wasn't what I would expect for a restaurant in his price range. Definitely worth visiting for the filet alone!"}
{"text":"I loooove this restaurant. Everything is wonderful. The service is fantastic and all the waiters are very nice, the ambiance is intimate, classy, and romantic, and the food is delicious. The creme brulee dessert is a must-try and comes as a plate of creme brulee with a cookie gondola with chocolate and berries. Plenty of good wines available, too. And, as an added perk, you get a free gondola ride pass if you have dinner here. There is a lagoon behind the hotel where gondoliers will row you around and sing to you. Magical experience. :)"}
{"text":"This has the potential of a 5-star restaurant.
The Ribeye is outstanding. Worth even more than the $30 price. Plus, the drinks are tasty, and both our Server Justin and his Assistant were incredibly kind and helpful.

Unfortunately there were many things about our visit that left my fiancée and I frustrated:

-We waited a long time for pretty much everything. We assume they were severely understaffed that night, but both our appetizer and our entrees took a very long time to arrive. Near the end of the meal it seemed like Justin had way too many tables and barely enough time to even stop by.

-Because of the wait, our server offered to take the Scallops off the menu. They were honestly a bit cold upon arrival and not amazing. When the check came, they were not off the bill, but he was so busy we didn't want to wait for that change.

-While my steak was outstanding, my fiancée thought her Pasta was pretty ordinary/something she could have made at home.

-There is no bathroom in the restaurant. You have to cross through the other restaurant in the Hotel and go past the elevators to use a restroom.

-The Gondola ride was amazing and a wonderful touch, but it isn't really advertised as a free addition to the meal. We had to ask about it, and then remind our server to bring out the passes.

Like I said, this has the potential of being an incredible restaurant. We may have just been there on an off night."}
{"text":"For a dinner at the Hyatt Regency this restaurant did me well. It's a swanky place where you can dress for an occasion- as we have seen the next table over celebrate 35 years of marriage! 

A starter menu of mini finger foods to select is given along with the regular menu. Knowing what we all wanted for dinner, we dove in for the entree because we all know that we have to save room for dessert!  The server first asked if we dined with them before and since it was our first time he asked if we had any questions about the menu. I had to ask about the confit crispy duck leg and pan seared duck breast since it is one of my faves. My other to-eat-wish-list item was the baked ziti with braised short rib. I decided to go with the dual duck plate to try the different cooking style. The pan seared duck breast looked like cut slices of a beef filet with a hint taste of liver undertones. Paired with the sweet and sour glaze and toasted pine nuts complemented the taste quite well. Cutting into the crispy confit part was delicious and easy. Biting into the crispness of the skin and soft parts of the meat worked well too. Brussel spouts, pearl onions and other winter vegetables gave an earthy and comfort side to the dish. 

Dessert: knowing me I had to choose the dessert that seem like the not as popular: white chocolate panna cotta. I love panna cotta if made right. This was categorized as rich and decadent! Aka made to share with others. This was presented in a giant saucer looking plate. At first glance it looked like the dessert was missing but it was a small bowl sized dessert with 2 slivers of circle cut honey glazed pear, brown butter whipped cream and bits of dried cut apricot. The texture of the panna cotta itself was thick and creamy. For some reason it had an orange undertone to the panna cotta -which I'm not opposed to because I love oranges. 

The only star that was docked off was my water refill. At the beginning of the meal my water was filled to the rim. By dessert time I didn't get a single refill.

After eating you will get  complimentary tickets to the gondola ride! Have fun!"}
{"text":"Food and outdoor atmosphere great!!  John our server was exceptional with recommendations and attentiveness. We are here on a business trip and didn't have many restaurants to pick from at the Hyatt. We just arrived this evening. I had gnocchi with short ribs that were so tender it melted in my mouth. Husband had pasta with shrimp and sausage which was good and very spicy. We had salads that were great too. I had spinach and he had the house.  Plenty of delicious bread and oil or butter. Gelato for dessert and we were stuffed!  Got free tickets for a gondola ride but will do that another night. The huge gas fire pit was the perfect touch to add to the palm tree ambiance and keep us warm too. It was 65 degrees and so comfy with the blazing fire right next to our table. Servers for water, bread and wine were on the ball too. So nice all around. Give it a 5!!!"}
{"text":"This has become my go-to for a \"nice, but not overly pricey--fancy, but not crazy black tie affair fancy\" restaurant.  First, its located inside the Hyatt at Gainey Ranch which is a beautiful hotel and worth visiting just to listen to the live music.  I'd recommend ordering the ribeye for you meat lovers out there.  It's incredibly tasty, perfectly cooked and has a great sauce.  Also it comes with a side of your choice and I find the meal to be quite a good deal.  If you're not into the red meat, I'd also recommend the shrimp pasta.  That was fabulous.  The sauce was rich, but not too rich, and the shrimp were huge.  Lastly, for dessert if you like creme brulee, you have to get their signature gondola--its a huge plate of creme brulee with a cookie and chocolate gondola on top.  It's beautiful and delicious!  As an added bonus, when you dine at Alto, they give you complimentary \"tickets\" (they look like postcards), for a free gondola ride over by the lake.  A nice touch to end the evening, or you can even save the cards and come back at a later date to enjoy the ride.  Its a fun little activity that you normally wouldn't think to do in Scottsdale, AZ."}
{"text":"I've only been once and had a so-so experience with the main meal. 

We were greeted promptly and the server was very knowledgeable and professional. For Antipasti, we ordered the prosciutto di parma, fennel cured olives & grilled asparagus w/ herbed bread crumbs & Gorgonzola. The cerdegna bread that comes with was delish! I love truffle oil with aged meats and cheeses, so our server was kind enough to russle some up for me! I was a very happy girl. The prosciutto is aged 18 months and in the dining room is a quaint little glass room w/ hanging meats and cheeses. 

I ordered duck with an a la carte side of truffled soft polenta. The duck was a bit overdone but had great potential. I sent the duck back and got gnocchi. Also good on flavor, but the texture was too soft. Almost mushy. Not everyone can roll a good gnocchi! I was so full at this point, I skipped desert. Which I never do at new restaurants. I'd definitely give them a 2nd chance! 

Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place. The service is fantastic and the food is great. I really like the duck plate and veal pasta plate. The restaurant gives you a free ticket to the gondola ride at the hotel, which makes the perfect date night. It is very expensive by my standards and I only come here once in a blue moon, but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing time tonight at Alto. 

The restaurant has somehow an open layout, which leads straight to the hotel common areas. It can be confusing, but it's also pretty cool. 

The service was amazing and our server was very attentive and friendly without being overbearing.

For appetizer you MUST try the baked burrata. It's like heaven in a little pot. For entre I had a penne pasta with shrimp and sausage; an interesting combination but good nonetheless. Great sauce and tons of flavor. I was too full for dessert but I've heard their creme brûlée is amazing.

You get validated parking and a free ticket for the gondola ride. Quite relaxing after dinner and the guy even sings for you. It's a short ride, but certainly sweet :)

Overall I had a great experience. The only downside of this place in my opinion, is the fact that despite being an Italian restaurant, they only have four pasta dishes in the menu. Four. So if you're looking for endless pasta options, look elsewhere. 

Other than that, it's a nice, classy, good restaurant. I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"I love alto. I came here on my first date with my boyfriend, look how well it worked out for him! :)  Alto is a cross between a truly chef driven type resturant, and a more trendy place like Postinos.  It has some dishes that are more accessible and some that are more haute cuisine, all perfectly executed.  Being a vegetarian, I stick to the basics, Mushroom Soup, which is incredibly creamy and savory, and the Insalata Caprese.  Alto takes both dishes to a new level. The Caprese salad is fresh burrata mozarella with the heirloom tomatoes that are so ripe that they literally melt in your mouth. they serve it with b asil of course, but add a touch of preserved lemon rind which balances the sweetness of the tomato, and basil and the creaminess of the mozarella with a touch of salty and sour.  great wine list.  great ambiance.  Oh and they serve their cheese platter with bread and two jams, fig and apricot sage jam. delicious.  i heart alto.  on weekends you can wander around twards the main lobby of the hotel where they have flamenco band and dancers performing.  A great restraurant and a great date place."}
{"text":"I am a little torn, although for such a high end restaurant, I guess you are supposed to have everything under control.  We came here for a surprise birthday party for one of my girlfriends.  We were 12 people in the party.  The place is nice, and the setting is beautiful.  I had the pepper soup to start and my husband had the salad.  I didn't care for my soup, I couldn't finish it.  My husband's salad was ok.  For dinner I had the sea bass and my husband had the filet with the cherry pepper pesto.  His steak was very good, my sea bass was ok. The cocktails were pretty good, I had a martini and my husband had a spicy margarita.  One of my girlfriends had the Starburst cocktail, she said it was good, but a little sweet.  The service was ok, but not great.  When we had the cake, the servers were scrambling to get the coffee, then they forgot to pass the sugar and cream, so it seemed a little disorganized.  We had a good time because we had great company, but I am not sure I will come back.  I didn't get to go on the gondola because it was so late and I was too tired to wait for out 10:05 ride.  I had been there since 6p.m. with huge heels, it was definitely time to put my little doggies to rest."}
{"text":"What a great experience for my Wife's birthday.  At first, we couldnt find the specific restaurant, but asked a staff member who showed where it was in the back.  What a beautiful resort;ive been living in Tempe for five years and had no idea it existed.

After we were seated, an assistant server took our order.  Our main server did not come for quite a few minutes, which has me worried.  However, when he arrived, Michael apologized for the delay.  

My wife and I ordered a cheese board, white anchovies, grilled Ahi Tuna, the homemade pasta with mushroom marsala sauce, and roasted tomatoes with parmeseasn.  In all, it cost 69$ after tax before tip--very reasonable.

The cheese board was great, with homemade jams.  The meal also came with a complimentary bread basket (we had two lol).  The anchovies were just OK, would not order again would rather get more cheese.  The Grilled Ahi was very good, tasted fresh and the chef let the flavors of the tuna stand out serving it only with a caponata, or what I call an Italian salsa.  The pasta was delicious even though i generally do not like cream sauce.  It did not taste like cream sauce i have ever eaten before -- it literally had a ton of fresh whole fancy mushrooms in the sauce.  It was also served with wilted argula which tasted great when mixed in with the sauce.

Michael our server was great.  He offered us a dessert on the house because of my Wife's birthday.  We chose the chocoloate hazelnut cake.  When they brought out the creme brulee, we sent it back and apologized for the misunderstandiing.  To make it even better, Michael came back with both the creme brulee and the chocolate cake--both on the house.

The meal also came with two complimentary gondola ride tickets.  No, its not Venice, but this was a great experience as well.  A great way to end the evening when the weather is perfect.  All in all, this was a great experience at a reasonable cost."}
{"text":"What rhymes with Wednesday?! Whiskey, that's what! Ok, not really, but Wednesday is a good day to go to Alto Ristorante, get there early, swing over by the Center Stage Bar, and grab a Desert Manhattan while waiting for the rest of the crew. Then, take a seat, take in the gorgeous view while indulging in the yummy concoction the bartender just made. Yup, that's how my evening started. 

Once my crew arrived, we went over to Alto Ristorante and got seated outside on the patio on the most perfect evening in Scottsdale! After getting settled in, Jenna came over and introduced herself, got our drink order, and informed us that Lisa would be our server. Not a moment later, Lisa came over and told us the special of the evening, and gave us recommendations on appetizers. We ended up ordering bruschetta:

* fegato: chicken liver spread, roasted grapes, candy hazelnuts (didn't try this one, the chicken liver spread grossed me out, lol) 
* mozzarella: buffalo mozzarella, roasted tomatoes, basil (this one was flavorful and delish!)
* arrabiatta: tomatoes, olives and garlic (loved this one too!) 

Then we ordered a really nice Cabernet Savignon (I think it was 130, hehe). It was a great wine! I highly recommend it! 

For entrees, we ordered: 

* guance di vitello ravioli: braised veal cheek with house-made ricotta ravioli and
wilted arugula in a black truffle marsala sauce (This was AWESOME!!! The veal was so tender, it melted in my mouth. And the pasta was cooked al dente, my absolute favorite!)
* pollo scottato: pan-seared chicken breast, meyer lemon glaze, heirloom 
tomatoes, roasted butternut squash, sautéed escarole (This dish was extremely flavorful as well and just absolutely mouth-wateringly delicious!)
* branzino: Mediterranean sea bass, eggplant caponata, 
salsa verde and celeriac puree (Amazing dish! The fish was flaky and cooked to perfection, and the flavors of the eggplant, salsa, and puree went together with it fantastically.)

Then for dessert, (yes, we got dessert, haha! We were being fatties):

* gondolino: vanilla crème brûlée with a floating, chocolate dipped
gondola filled with fresh berries (You can't go wrong with this!)
* torta di nocciole: chocolate hazelnut cake, amarena cherries, milk chocolate hazelnut mousse, espresso cream, wild cherry puree (For chocolate and Nutella lovers, THIS is the dessert for you! OMGoodness it's an explosion of chocolate and coffee and yumminess in your mouth.)
* crostata di pere: poached pears, local honey, sweet almond cream, ricotta cheese, honey ice cream (This was ok -- it was almost like apple pie with ice cream. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, just not the \"grand finale\" of desserts. It is, however, on the lighter side.)

After dinner, don't forget (and definitely don't skip) going with the Gondola. I had no idea there was a Gondola in Scottsdale -- who would've thought it?! You get free vouchers with dinner which is a plus! And the gentleman that took us with the Gondola has a superb Opera voice and serenades you with authentic Italian songs. Fantastic end to the evening!"}
{"text":"Fabuloso!!! 
 I visited Alto Restaurant for a nice dinner. The ambience was perfect, and the service exceptional. 
We had the perfect Filet mignon with the best truffle sauce ever!! I can boldly say that it was the best sauce I had ever had which tasted delightful with my filet. Very perfectly cooked meat and the presentation was gorgeous tooo!!
Their dessert selection is also quite decadent. We ordered the hazelnut cherry cake and it was just so satisfying.
Everything we ate at Alto was superb and I am sure to visit again for another fancy meal. The food here is worth every penny spent."}
{"text":"Alto's Ristorante is outstanding!   We came here for a Birthday dinner and the food was mouth watering. 

We started with a glass of wine and selected a \"make your own\" antipasti (a must).  We were sitting outside near a fire pit which added to the ambiance of the evening. 

After a leisurely period of enjoying the appetizers and wine our attentive waiter came by (several times) to check our glasses and update us on the arrival of our meal.

Three of us order different pasta dishes.  We all shared and they were great!  There really was no downside to our experience.

WOW!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a meal! Our waiter Christoph was fantastic, he was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and expertly paired our meal with delicious wines. He really made our whole dining experience over the top. The meal was incredible start to finish, we started off with antipasti, followed by salads and delectable entrees. I highly recommend the Tagliatelle and the Gnocchi. The Filetto was also amazing. For dessert you must have the creme brûlée, it was perfect. If you enjoy a great dining experience and have an appreciation for wine this restaurant is a must try."}
{"text":"Solid, pretty good, dessert was really good, but for the overall price....OVER RATED!!!!! Not to mention the 25min wait for our entrees on a thurs night when it wasn't even busy. So as far as a next time....nope, no next time, but the free gondola ride was pretty sweet!"}
{"text":"We had the best experience here! We were on a rare date night and our server, Natasha, went the extra mile to make it special. She was so friendly and helpful! I started with the spinach salad which had the most amazing dressing made with truffles and Dijon. For my entree I ordered the special which was large prawns on top of spinach fettuccini alfredo. They were like two small lobster and when i told Natasha I could not eat that much she suggested a half portion which was perfect! She even brought us complimentary creme brûlée which was amazing. The food was great and the service even better. I highly recommend this place, especially for a date night! After you can ride a gondola (they give you free passes at this restaurant) or enjoy a drink while listening to live entertainment in the outside lobby. Thanks alto for giving us a much needed break from our hectic lives!"}
{"text":"While I really enjoyed almost every aspect of my stay at the Hyatt this was the one disappointment. I hate to give a bad review but we really didn't enjoy anything that we ate. The service was above standard.  It was the food.... Just not good. The menu is complicated and the outcome of the food just doesn't mix. If you're staying here. .... Go somewhere else to eat cause I am sure there are real Italian restaurants in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Serious legit Italian food. The charcutterie is fantastic!  The veal cheek with hommade ravioli is sick!  Very tasty. Staff seemed informed. Inside is a little sleepy, outside is tricky with the birds but if you hit the right time of day the experience can be really great!  Nice find for resort food!"}
{"text":"A bit disappointed, I'm afraid.  I can only rate the food as so-so.  The filet was very tender and cooked to perfection, but the salmon was mushy--and the plating for both was a bit bizarre (garbanzo beans with salmon?). Also, the roasted potatoes were dry and lacked flavor.  But on an up note, the mushrooms were wonderful (I loved the variety!).

Our waiter was Philip.  I thought perhaps this was his first night as he was completely overwhelmed.  However, I see a couple of other people have mentioned they had the same issue with Philip previously, so I'm afraid this does not appear to be an isolated incident of first night jitters.

Sebastian, his helper, came out right away with our bread and water, and came back often to assure us Philip would be right with us, but we were seated at least 10 minutes before Philip appeared.  By the way, I should mention we came early (6:30) to avoid the dinner rush hour and there was only one other couple seated when we got there.  We placed our order for cocktails, which didn't arrive for another 10 minutes (and weren't what we ordered).  After bringing the drinks, he went over the menu with us, but left again without taking our order because he forgot his pad and had to go back to get it.  Not certain where he left it, but we didn't see him again for another 10 minutes.

The main course came out 20 minutes or so after that, but we never did see our dinner salads (they weren't on the bill either--so I guess he just forgot to write them down when we placed our order).  After bringing out our main course and side dishes, he completely disappeared and never came back to check on us until we were done with our meal.  We debated ordering dessert, but by this time we had been there over 90 minutes, and were afraid we wouldn't see our selection for at least another 30 minutes, so opted to just pay the bill and leave.  Thank God we had cash, because it was another 15 minutes just to get the check!

All in all I would rate the food a 3 to 4, but the service was only a 2.  Had the service been better I would have given the Alto a 4."}
{"text":"I went here twice during my visit. The first time I had an amazing server Christoff and a lovely meal. I had the pasta with sausage and shrimp we also ordered the scallops which were tasty but had to cooked twice due to being under cooked first time. I like the seating outside by the fire and very well done with decor. The honey salted honey and warm bread are amazing. Second night I ordered the ravioli and it was not good. The cheese platter however was spot on and really good. For a hotel restaurant it was better then expected."}
{"text":"First off; I ordered the calamari, it was chewy and had no flavor at all!  As for the main dish, I ordered the Italian sausage as my wife ordered the chicken. The Italian sausage had no flavor what so ever, as for the chicken, it was overcooked and also had no flavor just as the other dishes. 

The only food that was good was the bread and salad, I will not be returning to this restaurant, and I will absolutely never recommend it to anyone!!!

I think for a restaurant of this price range and expertise, I expected a lot more than a waste of money and my time!

If I could give this restaurant a negative score, I could!"}
{"text":"I'm seriously very bummed that I do not live closer to this restaurant.
I was staying at the Hyatt while in town for business and after a VERY long 13 hour day my coworkers and I dragged ourselves from the parking lot and plopped down at Alto.
We ordered a very much deserved and necessary bottle of Malbec recommended by our very friendly server and basked in the patio scenery.
I instantly gravitated to the caprese salad as a starter- fresh buffalo mozzarella, local heirloom tomatoes, torn basil pieces, preserved lemon rinds, and homemade croutons drizzled with a high quality olive oil.
Seriously- THE BEST caprese I've ever had in my entire life.
I'm still dreaming about it.
As for the main course I ordered the sausage pappardelle- fresh Italian sausage in a light and spicy tomato sauce tossed with fresh pappardelle- very simple and VERY delicious.
Someone should really get on that whole teleporation thing because I would totally teleport to this place when the Italian craving hits."}
{"text":"This is an excellent spot in the Hyatt which is hidden away. Great wine list and fantastic foods with great presentation. Service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Got here last minute at 10:15 and asked if I could still get food. I was told they close at 9:00 and were only open till 10:30 on weekends. Either yelp has the hours wrong or they didn't want to serve a hungry customer. Won't be attempting to come back again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. The atmosphere was nice when they opened the windows. Our dinner came with a complimentary gondola ride. The waiter forgot our bruschetta but that was a blessing in disguise because he brought out creme brulee on the house for our anniversary. Over all I really enjoyed my dinner here."}
{"text":"Ambiance was really good. The charcuterie platter was excellent, haven't tasted prosciutto that great before!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food!  My waiter was very helpful.  He recommended the spinach salad, which was delicious.  Tasty salad dressing, crisp pancetta, marcona almonds with a wonderful cheese from Italy.  Entrée was awesome too.  Italian sausage with red sauce and homemade noodles.  The sausage was very flavorful and lean, sauce was perfect.  The bread and olive oil were top of the line!  Too full to order dessert ~  Lovely setting, we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here last week with a family. This is our forth time staying at hyatt and we always dine here. It had been 10 months we hadn't been there since last time and this time the food was the same great food and service was awesome. ."}
{"text":"Very good gourmet Italian .  Not traditional at all.  It's in a setting that is inside an  incredible resort. The fish was greatly prepared.  Pork belly was a little tough in the gnocchi.  The chicken was awesome and the meat and cheese tray is a MUST!  Great food prep and the staff is very accommodating!"}
{"text":"Ambiance very pleasant for dining on a beautiful patio on the first pleasant evening of the fall.  There was a little noise by happy tourists from the nearby pool which did not disturb us.  Our food very good---I had the Restaurant Week menu and DH ordered off the standard menu.  I started with a salad of heirloom tomatoes with burrata and preserved lemon that was the best caprese salad ever---and I absolutely loved my monkfish saltimboca and herbed polenta.  The almond cake with chocolate mousse was very tasty, but not extraordinary, although the coffee knocked my socks off!  DH had the chicken saltimbocca, risotto, and warm tomato salad.   DH's risotto was absolutely perfect and the tomato salad was an interesting side dish, the little roasted tomatoes miniature flavor bombs, but DH thought his chicken saltimbocca was a little dry.  Our server overheard and offered to bring him something else, but DH said no and ate 75% of his entree.  And yet they still took it off our bill.  We hadn't asked for this, he ate the dish after-all, but we were told if he wasn't absolutely satisfied with his meal, then they wanted to comp it.  We were impressed by this commitment to customer service!  This is what a multi-star resort is all about.   And actually, what made our experience outstanding and Alto a \"return restaurant\" was the exceptional service we received from Jay.  He was warm, professional, attentive---it felt like we were valued guests in his home.  Dining establishments should never underestimate the affect the level of service has on the overall experience.  Jay left us with satisfied smiles.  And I need to mention Jenna, who assisted Jay and was a lovely young woman, and even the manager who stopped by our table to say hello was a very polished and courteous gentleman.  Oh---one more person---the young man bartending at the SWB who served us wine while we waited for Alto to open (early reservation)---another excellent representative of the Hyatt Corporation.  

I happily recommend Alto to residents and travelers alike.  I do not think you will be dissatisfied."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Alto the other night. It was excellent.Not what you expect in a Hotel Restaurant. It was reasonably price and high quality food. A great variety of Antipasti including wonderful small plates of Iralian Cheeses, Salumis, ham,and many other goodies priced in the $5 range. Also interesting salads.The Entrees include very good pastas, meats and seafood.The Chef really knows his fish and prepares them well. We live nearby and it's as good as any place in Scottsdale. Do try"}
{"text":"My wife and I had our first anniversary dinner here last night.  The service was outstanding, Jay was our waiter and his assistant was very nice and bubbly as well.  Jay greeted us warmly, gave us great descriptions of the specials and helped us select a great wine to start us off.

We had the fritto misto for a starter.  Huge prawns, tender calamari and fresh squash blossoms were battered and deep fried and served with a roasted tomato dipping sauce.  We both loved it.

My wife had the pasta carbonara.  Penne pasta, with egg yolk, bacon, cream and truffled arugula.  OMG that was fantastic but also very rich, she was full fast.

I had the veal, cooked perfectly between rare and medium, with sauteed mushrooms.  OMG IT WAS F*CKING GREAT!  Sorry, but there is no other way to say it!  

Our waiter treated us to a complementary creme brule because it was our anniversary... it was amazing, perfect and creamy with the wonderful crunch of the burnt sugar on top... So lovely!  I love creme  brule.  It was served with fresh black berries, strawberries, blueberries, a chocolate curl and a tiny marzipan sign that read \"Happy Anniversary\", all on top of the cutest little cookie gondola.  


I would love to try the fixed menu, but at $65 each, I will probably HAVE to wait for next year!

Oh, and my wife was very dissapointed in one thing... IT RAINED!  She'd been planning this night for forever for the gondola ride (because my dream vacation is Venice), but of course the first storm of the season had to hit that night!  LOL... its the thought that counts!

We will definitely return to Alto, and I'm not waiting a whole year for it!  I need to try the antipasti... all of the wonderful cheese, meats and fruits sounded so good, but we opted to get a starter instead.  Don't want to over eat before the main course!"}
{"text":"We were there to celebrate my birthday.  It became a memory of lifetime.

They have nice wine list and our server was very knowledgeable about the wine they had on the list. Both of our server and the front desk staff at the hotel recommended the veal, and they were right! One of the best veal we ever had. We enjoyed cheese and ham from antipasti section, followed by scallop appetizer, caprese salad (mozzarella melted in my mouth), veal entree, and to my surprise desert with birthday message on it! 

Server was very attentive and very knowledgeable about wine and food. 

Amazing food, great wine, superb service, nice decor,...  Can anything be better than this?"}
{"text":"We came here years ago and thought we would have the same experience. We almost did until we realized we were charged twice. This is not a cheap place to dine; so you can imagine that although the food was exquisite, being charged twice is not the way you want to end the night--on a weekend. I give them 2 stars due to the lack of attention to detail during check out. For almost being a 5 star restaurant, I expect quality customer service from the moment you walk in and through check out. The food was amazing and the gondola ride was very romantic but I will not be returning. Tip: baller or not--check your online banking before you leave."}
{"text":"I have been to alto a few times now. There's no denying the food is pretty great and definitely affordable for a higher end restaurant. My one thing that gets me every time is that the restaurant is the service. Service is SLOW. Not bad but just slow and a little forgetful."}
{"text":"The ambiance is a 5.  Especially the fact that you get a Gondola ride around the property.  The food though I'd give a solid 3.5.  The drinks are great but the entrees were less than sparkling.  It's a great date place and you'll certainly love your time there but if you're looking for foodie paradise it's not quite here yet."}
{"text":"The service! If you are lucky when you visit this restaurant your server will be Tommy! He was great! Very informative and knew the menu inside and out! I was extremely impressed with the way the service went! I am going to go on record and say best service ever! Today is a very special day for me... I turned 29 years old and I wanted to par take in some good food! Thank you Alto for having great food! I had the crab pesto pasta something! Basically deliciousness in my mouth! With some awesome sauce! I also had the pleasure of experiencing the stuffed mushrooms!! I am just glad my boyfriend and I are in love because I didn't want to share, but I did! Great place great service great food"}
{"text":"Went here tonight with some co workers for a holiday party.  We had such a great time. Food was great, service was excellent, and enjoyed the complimentary gondola ride to end the evening. The resultant is located in the Hyatt so once you self park or valet you walk through the front doors and it's on the left hand side in the back. There was people we asked but you walk through the bistro to get there. We made reservations so they sat us in a cute romantic room up front. They even had some Christmas Carolers come in and sing 3 songs which was a fun touch while we were waiting for our food. 

We started with the antipasti menu and ordered bruschetta, assortment of meats and cheeses, olives, and it came with bread with fig spread and apricot jam. They also served asiago bread with oil and basalmic. The basalmic was amazing!!! 

I got the bone-in pork chop and it was cooked to perfect and so delicious with the sauce it came in. My fiancé got the New York strip which was also good and tender. 

For dessert we had to get the gondalini(creme brûlée) and tiramisu. The tiramisu wasn't great, it had chocolate cake which I thought was weird. But the creme brûlée was amazing! It's huge and comes with a cute sugar gondola filled with berries. I couldn't stop eating it. It's a must have!!! 

Dinner service comes with free gondola vouchers. We finished the night with one. It fits 4 people per boat and they give you blankets to stay warm. It's a quick 15min ride but it's very romantic and peaceful at night and the man sings a song in Italian which was beautiful. They also have a huge bar with heaters everywhere, and fire pits so would be pretty to hang out after. 

Overall it was a great and romantic experience that we have never done before. Food is pricey but would be a great romantic date night or great for parties. Highly recommend (:"}
{"text":"My wife found a deal for the dinner which prompted our visit to this great Italian restaurant.

We were served fresh bread with very creamy butter as our waiter Christopher introduced us to the menu. I mentioned that my wife was vegetarian and he offered multiple options based on items on the menu. He was sure to mention the altered dishes would still be flavorful which was reassuring.

We started with the baked burrata which included a flavorful tomato sauce topped with burrata (made from mozzarella) with fresh bread which was slightly thicker and softer than the bread initially brought to the table. The sauce was very tasty and the cheese was creamy and subtle.

My entrée was the rigatoni without shrimp (pictured). When I asked for no shrimp Christopher mentioned it would be supplemented with more sausage. I thoroughly enjoyed the dish with great sausage that had multiple flavors that included fennel, but none were overpowering. The dish features the same sauce as with the baked burrata and I found myself scraping the plate to get every last bit.  The pasta itself was good, however I overheard that unlike other pastas, the rigatoni is not made on site.

For dessert I enjoyed the espresso mascarpone. The flavors were subtle, not too sweet, and had a good balance between the espresso, cream, and cake flavors. The chocolate covered coffee beans were a nice bonus.

The ambiance of the restaurant was great and we enjoyed the early autumn breeze through the opened glass wall.Make sure you make a reservation and call ahead if you want an outside table.

We would definitely return and although I would like to try something else, but I'll probably end up getting the rigatoni again."}
{"text":"Tip: My sister bought a groupon for this restaurant that allowed us to chow down and order an obscene amount of food at a reasonable price for 8 people. If you can find it, I highly recommend it. 

Environment: I've visited the Hyatt regency in Scottsdale almost every year for the past decade on business. This is a very nice hotel, and has a gorgeous outside area that hosts very lovely dinners/events on the grassy knoll out back. 

Food: the food was quite good. Phenomenal and life changing? No. But still good! We ordered the:

ARANCINI (fried risotto ball) - crispy fritter, smoked mozzarella, speck Americano, English pea pesto 
BAKED BURRATA - saffron tomato sauce, basil pesto, grilled noble country breadASSORTED OLIVES (best. Olives. Ever.) - black gaeta, green castleveltrano, red cerignolas 
BRUSCHETTA DUO - buffalo mozzarella, dried tomatoes, micro basil, balsamic with prosciutto di parma, honey comb cheese, toasted almonds

RIGATONI - italian sausage, shrimp, spicy tomato sauce, pickled rapini, toasted breadcrumbs 

GNOCCHI - pork belly, baby zuchinni, heir loom tomato, black truffle sauce, fennel pollen 

PARPADELLE - lamb shank, fava beans, pea shoots, red wine demi-glaçe

BONUS: a GONDOLA ride is included with your dinner!! They provide you a coupon you can use for the ride, right on the Hyatt regency premises!"}
{"text":"AMAZING!  Not only did they move a table around so we could have a round instead of square (so the 2 of us could sit side by side better), but the food and service were amazing!!  Whitney did a FANTASTIC job taking care of everything...including getting the chef to share some extra spicy tomato jam to go!!!  I strongly suggest the bruschetta with the spicy tomato jam and burrata!!   The artichoke side was stellar and the tagliatelle with shrimp and sausage were top notch!! The atmosphere is wonderful and then being serenaded by Marcos on a gondola ride was fantastic!!  We will be coming back...often!!!  Great to hear the live music in the lobby bar before, during and after as well!

key points...table #60, round not square, ask for Whitney, top off with a gondola ride with Marcos...home run for a great night out for 2 (or more, but I like the 2!!)"}
{"text":"My husband & I were looking for a fun date night idea and he found this great place. The atmosphere was relaxing, romantic and upbeat all at the same time. The food was good with bursts of Italian flavor. The waiter assistants were amazing, however, the actual waiters were lacking in their service. Our waiter was not attentive, kept us waiting several times for menu clarification, appetizers, and check request. This is a great place with great people, great atmosphere. There is even a great gondola ride under moonlight very close!"}
{"text":"I took my wife here for her 34th birthday and we had an excellent experience! And I say \"experience\" because it was all great - the food, the ambiance, the servers, the wine, all of it! Often times a meal will be great in some areas but lacking in others, but not this one. 

My wife wanted to try something a little different (which is rare for her!), so we did the \"Chef's Tasting Menu\" for $65/person. The catch? You don't know what you're getting until they set it down in front of you! It was supposed to be a 4-course meal, but we actually received 6 courses. 

To get things going we ordered a bottle of the \"Umani Ronchi Jorio Montepulciano d'Abruzzo\" for $55. It was a very impressive bottle of wine for the price, I highly recommend it. I'd give it a solid 92pts and I'm somewhat of a wine snob. Great table wine which went well with almost everything we ate, except for the Arctic Char. You can also get chef-selected wine pairings with each course of the meal for an additional $20/person, but he said they only give 2oz pours and you only get it with 3 courses, so you only end up with about a glass and a half of wine that way. 

For the antipasti (not included with the tasting menu) I ordered a plate of the assorted olives for $5, and we received a rather large plate of 3 different types of olives. The first was cerignola olives marinated in lemon juice with bay leaves, the second was gaeta olives (simlar to kalamata) marinated in oil w/fennel, and the third was castelvetrano marinated in garlic. The cerignolas were BUTTERY smooth and delicious - almost tasted like a dessert olive, if there is such a thing - and they were my favorite. The gaetas tasted just like a regular kalamata olive, which I love. And the castelvetranos, which were absolutely humongous, lacked a unique flavor. 

Our tasting menu started off with a chilled roasted tomato & bell pepper soup, which was nothing more than a few bites in the bottom of a large bowl. Excellent soup, but it was barely enough to even spark our appetites. I said to my wife, \"Uh oh, looks like we'll need to hit a Taco Bell after dinner to fill up!\" But as the night went on the courses got larger and we actually ended up rather full. 

Anyhow, on to the second course - salad. It was a small sample-size salad made with arugula, pears, taleggio cheese and a raspberry jam dressing. The pears were carmelized to perfection and the cheese had a \"brûlée\" type sugar coating on the top. The presentation was unique with each component of the salad placed separately on the plate, and when you combined a little bit of each together for a bite it was pure heaven. 

The third course, \"primi piatti\", was a filet of arctic char, which was seared to perfection and served with some sort of sauce (which I can't remember what it was). It was my first time having Arctic Char, and I found it tasted like a mix between salmon and trout - it had a little bit of that \"salmony\" flavor, but more rich tasting like trout.  

Next, we had the gnocchi with a \"rabbit ragu\" (yes, rabbit - and it was delicious!). I first had gnocchi a few years ago in Italy and I was hooked! This gnocchio was cooked to perfection, and the rabbit ragu was absolutely delicious. This was the only course that my wife didn't like because she said the rabbit ragu was too \"earthy\" tasting, which I think is due to the spices that the chef used, but I loved it. 

Four our fifth course we had a veal filet, topped with a calamata olive based puttanesca sauce. I love veal, and I love calamata olives, and this was spectacular! Once again the veal was cooked to perfection. 

Our meal ended with a piece of flourless chocolate cake w/pistachio gelato. I'm not usually a big fan of \"flourless\" cakes because they tend to be dry and/or bitter, but not this one. It was fairly most and did have a touch of bitter chocolate taste to it, but not too much. And when you paired a bite with the pistachio gelato it was a perfect balance of flavors, and the chocolate melted in your mouth. 

If you opt to do the tasting menu keep in mind that the portions are going to be very small, but you will get enough food over the course of the meal to more than fill you up. Both my wife and I went home completely satisfied, and we even had some leftover olives to take home with us. I highly recommend this place, and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food was good. I ordered the swordfish chefs special and it came out great. The gondola ride was also nice. Overall 4 stars due to it being a little to pricey."}

It sounds like a lot of food, but it wasn't too bad.  The portions are not over the top huge.  Out of the 3 Bruschettas we tried, my favorite was the Fagioli.  It was totally different than anything I've tried before.  The Beans went very well with the Prosciutto and Bread.

The Fettuccine all Bolognese was awesome....very rich though.  The Veal & Pork Shank Ragout was what made it rich and full of flavor.  I had a bite of The Better Half's Anatra and it was good too.  The side of Risotto went perfectly with our meal.

I was only able to get a small bite out of TBH's Creme Brulee....she doesn't like to share her Dessert, ha!  It was delish....next time, we'll order less Bruschetta so I can get one for myself.

Service was outstanding during the entire meal.

{"text":"I was taken here as a surprise for my anniversary and it was phenomenal. My boyfriend and I deem ourselves to be well-rounded foodies and I have to say that alto was the perfect place for us! For our first course we started off with mozzarella bruschetta- absolutely delicious! For our main course I ordered a chicken dish (unfortunately the specific name of the dish is escaping me at the moment). The chicken; which was cooked to perfection was joined on the plate by a medley of heirloom tomatoes, squash, and other delectable morsels. The best part of this dish was the sauce that was tactfully drizzled on and around the food. This sauce tied everything together so fantastically that my mouth is watering as I type this review. My boyfriend ordered the raviolis; which were highly recommended by our server Christoph and the servers assistant Shaun. These two know what they're talking about! The raviolis were superb! If I remember correctly the raviolis were filled with a ricotta herb blend and covered in a beautiful Marsala sauce. My boyfriend looked like he had gone to heaven after the first bite! He let me try a piece and I agree- it is incredibly delicious! After the main course had ended the dessert menu was brought out with several decadent and delectable choices! We decided to share the gondolino 8. Speechless... It left me speechless. Not only because I was stuffing my face as fast as I could but because of the presentation. The gondolino is a creme brûlée with a small edible gondola topped with fresh fruit. The creme brûlée looked as though it was the water the gondola was floating across. My first bite of the creme brûlée put me on the edge of my seat! Every spoonful was more enticing than the last! After the creme brûlée lake had been completely devoured another surprise was in store! We went straight to alto's gondola rides! All in all a phenomenal dining experience, incredible food, a beautiful gondola ride, and an anniversary that I'll never forget! Bravissimo!!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First, let me start of by saying the Hyatt Regency Gainey is gorgeous! 
It was kind of confusing how to find the restaurant. There weren't any signs that I noticed.
Dinner was delicious. I had the seared tuna perfectly cooked and my date had chicken with a tasty sweet glaze on it. 

I think the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that it wasn't really as romantic of an atmosphere as I expected. I think it was the location of where we were sitting and possibly the fact that it is a hotel and there were families with shrieking kids near us.

However, the service and staff were friendly and when I booked the reservation I made a note that the gondola ride was a surprise so the complimentary passes were sneaked to me by the waiter - AWESOME! It was very appreciated.

Then we went to find the Gondola's and that was confusing too. We walked around awhile until we figured it out, but that's ok because the resort is so pretty!

Overall, a new and different experience that you wouldn't think you would get to experience in the Valley and a must-do for a sweet/cute date night."}
{"text":"Brava to Alto Ristorante for a unique and delicious fine dining experience!! Came here with a Groupon for restaurant week after hearing about the complimentary gondola rides here! 

Usually I try to not order solely off the RW menu because I feel it's not the most accurate representation of the restaurant, so we picked one RW option and ordered the pappardelle with lamb off the regular menu. But wow was I blown away by the RW options!!! Started with a bruschetta and the antipasto (imported from Europe) tastes so flavorful and unlike the standard meats you can get at a supermarket. The prosciutto was so cured and salty and amazing, the honeycomb was such a nice complement along with the strawberries (!!!) which I was hesitant about. Definitely get the bruschetta here, or at least something with prosciutto/antipasto! For the main course- the striped sea bass was a real winner. I actually am salivating thinking of it now - perfectly crispy and flavored with the potatoes soaking up extra citrus glaze to go well with the bass. 

Now dessert: I didn't even get to try the RW cake C I was distracted by the gondolina. My oh my, the gondolina is actually the perfect dessert. It's a crème brulee broiled in a plate (as opposed to a traditional ramekin) designed to emulate a body o water. A gondola made of fortune cookie is filled with fruits and topped with a chocolate oar. I'm not a huge crème brulee person but with all the fruits- I ate that perfect dish until I was uncomfortably bloated and I. Regret. Nothing. 

Our server, Christoph, was lovely and joked that people travel far and wide simply for the gondola rides and the gondolina. After trying it though, I know he was not joking. Definitely get this!!! And if crème brulee is too sweet for you, an espresso or tea will balance it out perfectly!

To top off a wonderful meal, the music outside was wonderful, the ambiance was romantic, and the gondola!! So fun! I even had my aria request fulfilled! (Una Furtiva Lagrima for fellow opera nerds). AND self parking was validated!

I had such a wonderful dining experience I can't wait for an occasion to come back!"}
{"text":"Alto is located inside the Hyatt Regency Hotel and Resort, and is, in my opinion, one of the best restaurants to dine at inside the resort/hotel. I recently stayed in this hotel, and went to dinner for a total party of 4.

Food: The food was one of the best qualities of this place. They have a somewhat small menu and reasonable prices for what they serve. Unfortunately, some of the veggies are the same in every single dish. Everyone ordered something different, but 2 of us ordered the \"seasonal\" specials which was a 13oz prime rib and a seafood pasta dish. My steak came with just broccoli, and it was pickled. The server failed to mention this, and it ruined the taste of the steak for me at that point. The seafood pasta was ok, the mussels were overcooked, but otherwise pretty nice. I loved the pork loin dish, the peach glaze was quite tasty. They have a very extensive wine selection, and highly recommend trying some of their higher class wines!

Decor: Inside the restaurant they have a very simple, yet beautiful decor. They have indoor and outdoor seating. If it's cool enough, SIT OUTSIDE. You're close to the pool, and it's a beautiful view to just sit and relax.

Service: Sadly this is also why I dropped the rating. We had to chase down our server multiple times for drinks, the check, and to pick up the check. She was super nice, but between the menu not being fully explained, and having to chase down to leave, it wasn't the way I thought a $30-$50 dollar per person dining experience should've been.

I will absolutely be back, we stay at this resort every year. Even if you're not staying at this place, it's worth the visit!"}
{"text":"So, this will not be my best review, especially when I expected so much more from this place.

Lets get this out of the way and on the table first, this ws not a bad place to go, but, it wasnt my favorite by any means.  I went in expecting to pay a lot for the meal, and rightfully expected the best food I have ever had, and that was just NOT the case.  From the high prices to the limited menu, I would expect this place to specialize in the particular menu items, and would hope to have my taste buds dancing while I shout for more.  I didnt.

We started the meal with burratta forno cotto mozzarella.  it consists of oven baked burrata mozzarella served with grilled ciabatta, fried eggplant, lemon-truffle vinaigrette and parsley.  There were only two tiny ciabatta slices which was not the first complaint.  the second complaint would be that the fried eggplant could have used a bit more flavor.  (perhaps a little lemon pepper in the batter would have done some good) Lastly, the dish could have satisfied by just having a bit more cheese.  This dish was not bad by any means, just expected a bit more with the $12 price of two miniature slices of ciabatta and two thinly sliced pieces of eggplant.

on to the salad.  I dont know about you, but, when I order a salad, I expect a salad.  this was a salad, just not with any lettuce or salad look.  we ordered the caprese di pomodoro.  this dish is made with heirloom tomatoes, preserved lemon, herbs, fresh burrata mozzarella and extra virgin olive oil.  from the description, i assumed, dont ever assume, that this was going to have some spring mix as a salad base, then have the tomatoes witih cheese and basil, and then the lemon with olive oil as a dressing.  WRONG.  it was nothing more than what the description said.  it was two tomatoes cut in half, with a small amount of cheese and a few basil leaves and then the lemon preserve mixed with the olive oil on top.  dont get me wrong, this ws absolutely AMAZING, and I would love to have it again.  It is just not what I expected, so, it would have been nice to know what exactly I was ordering for $10.

To make matters worse, our so called salad took about 30 minutes to make its way to the table after putting in the order.  it took so long that the chef actually apologized and told management that he was going to send out a soup for us for the wait.  we were fine and in no rush, but, when we were already having our food take forever and told we were going to get soup, we expected it.  the soup never came.

finally, after waiting for and hour and a half for our main entree, we got our food.  it was good, but, nothing to write home about.  my pollo portofino was bland to say the least, and was actually a little dry.  the potatoes were decent, but again, a bit bland.

my date got the ravioli di mozzarella con salsa all'arrabbiata.  the ravioli pasta was so thick that you really couldnt taste the filling, and the sauce was to sweet in my and my date's opinion.

we however did order a side of the risotto parmigiano, and this was just amazing.  I am very happy that the recipe was on a poast card that came with the bill.  I will be making this at home in the coming week.

for dessert, we ordered pistachio gelato.  it was the best gelato I have ever had.

when it comes to a decision of returning to Alto, it will not be high on my list due to being over priced for what you get and all around, just not the best first experience.  I will however think of stopping in to get some risotto or gelato to go.

when it comes to good Italian, I think I will be sticking with Italian Gratto or Pane e Vino."}
{"text":"Hugely disappointed in this restaurant. We started with the baked burrata, which was great! Probably the only good thing we had all night. I ordered the garganelli with shrimp and Italian sausage. The shrimp was incredibly fishy to the point that I just had to take it out and the Italian sausage was flavorless and reminded me of the microwave meatballs you can buy at the grocery store. On top of all this the pasta was overlooked. My boyfriend ordered the tagliatelle, which the actual sauce and pasta was decent but the mussels were again extremely fishy and not up to par. At these prices we really expected to have great food and unfortunately this restaurant did not deliver. The ambiance is lovely and it was rather quiet but we were expecting some great food. We will not be returning and we suggest you head over to Noh right next door for some food that is worth the price!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but takes forever to arrive after you order. Each dish was good and the prices were ok but the portions were a bit small.  We enjoyed 2 meals here because the weather was so bad and were happy with our food."}
{"text":"Like most hotel restaurants, it was good but not super creative. We started with our free gondola ride, which is a nice extra of the meal.

They have a really creative drink menu. I ended up ordering a drink with Campari and carrot puree, which was delicious. 

We ordered:
-Baked buratta: saffron tomato sauce, walnut basil pesto, grilled noble country bread: I really liked the grilled bread touch. Flavors were on point.
-Grilled ahi tuna over a sweet potato purée, arugula and oyster mushrooms: this was my friend's dish ans she enjoyed it. 
-Black cod: charred tomato relish, parsnip purée, salsa verde, preserved lemon-fennel salad: the fish was cooked perfectly and the parsnip puree was unique. The salad was also a great flavor.
-Chocolate hazelnut mousse cake: gianduja mousse, chocolate brownie crust, chocolate glaze: a good dish for chocolate lovers

The dishes here were tasty but perhaps a bit small. I could have used more food.

The service here is excellent and overall, Alto added to a good stay at the Hyatt Regency Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My wife took me here for my birthday last night.  Lush green outdoor environment.  Charming cheese plate appetizer with yummy apricot and fig preserves.  Tasty duck breast with wonderful vegetables and the dark meat also.  Delightful crab capellini.  You have to see the gondolino dessert to believe it.  Creme brule definitely floats their boat.  Carafe of sparkling cava, as well as a Zinfandel with the duck. It was all topped off with the complimentary gondola ride with a singing gondolier.  What's not to like?"}
{"text":"Food was superb...our server CHRISTOPHE was soooo fabulous...he made my birthday VERY special...BEST service ever(and we've been dining here for years)....The burrata salad is to die for(house specialty)....the chef's special was DELICIOUS(huge prawns)"}
{"text":"Awesome dinner and experience. Food was excellent. John was our waiter and did a great job. We had the filet and creme brûlée."}
{"text":"If you go, you have to request Philip C. As your waiter.  He is the BEST!!   In fact, he is the best waiter I have ever had.

He greeted us upon arrival and explained all the menus.  The restaurant has a junior servicer to bring water and bread but it is not the same.  

He took our drink orders.  When he brought them back asked us how hungry we were and made suggestions.  I was a little disappointed that they only had shrimp or salmon as the fish choices.   These are pretty standard and I like something a bit different.  Do Philip arranged to get the Beramunde fish from SWB restaurant on property which was amazing.  

We had the Burata cheese dish as an appetizer and the Creme Brûlée for desert both on his recommendations which I don't think I would have picked otherwise.  They were amazing!  I am not a fan of Creme Brûlée but i am now, it was delicious."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, food tasted fantastic, especially the ribeye. That being said, obviously we were expecting it to be expensive but it was hard to see the value besides just the deliciousness; small menu selection, small portions, cramped seating with tables on top of each other."}
{"text":"The food was underwhelming for the price point.  The service was excellent with two servers always available, glasses always full and table constantly cleared.  Portions a little on the small side.  The atmosphere was excellent and the gondola ride is an excellent after dinner romantic treat topped with an Italian sing that encourages romance and a little kissing action."}
{"text":"Alto is good but it didn't blow me away. We are staying at the Hyatt and stayed in for dinner our first night. We ate at the bar as the restaurant was full. I ordered the watermelon agua fresco to drink which was good but kind of hard to drink as the watermelon kept getting stuck in the straw. For dinner I ordered the ziti with short ribs and burrata. It came out alarmingly fast....probably within 10 minutes which made me believe a lot of it was pre made and thrown together and it kind of tasted that way to me too. My friend however loved her food and drink so maybe I just ordered something off. The vibe was trendy and modern."}
{"text":"I've been here more than 4 times, and have always been very pleased with the experience. The food is very well prepared, \"outstandingly\" flavorful, service is attentive every time, and the ambiance is Great! Definitely one of my most favorite place to dine.

I remember 3 dishes we ordered and absolutely loved: spaghetti vongole, fettuccine bolognese,  and salmone con caponata. Others were great too, but I really can't remember.

And there are complimentary gondola ride and valet parking. As it's getting cooler, I'm thinking about going back there soon to enjoy their outdoor patio.

Their price isn't outrageous either. Main course range from $18 (pasta) to $26 (meat), rib eye is $32 though.

If it makes any difference, they are Diner's Choice Winner for Italian & Romantic. Yea, you can tell I love this place!"}
{"text":"Alto E gets an \"A\" for ambiance and service.  Alto E is situated in the Scottsdale Hyatt - beautiful venue.  The service was impeccable, the staff were attentive and friendly.

Where Alto E fails short, the food.  I was looking forward to a great meal and left disappointed.  We had the crab linguine and it was unbelievable salty.  We also had the duck confit and while the dish was decent, there was nothing spectacular about it.

The highlight of the night was the gondola ride, it came complimentary with our dinner.  Major brownie points if you're trying to impress your date."}
{"text":"This was our second time dining here and both times visits have been absolutely fantastic! The food and the quality are very good. Everything that we have eaten in this restaurant has been superb. The last time I went I had a rib-eye that was fantastic. The time before I had the four course chef meal and it was also fantastic. What's really need is to give you tickets to go on a gondola ride after the meal, unfortunately, the last time we went it was raining but they gave us vouchers to come back another time. Service was spot on and I really recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I ate here last night while staying at the Hyatt Gainey Ranch - but I would recommend this place even if you are not staying at the hotel.  It is classic Italian food with a very modern twist.  The interior is elegant but extremely modern, with a lovely wooden bridge taking you into the entryway with a very LARGE red door.  Our waiter was very helpful and answered all of our questions.

My friend and I ordered a bottle of pinot grigio (not a surprise if you've read any of my other reviews) however they did not have the same kind that was available at the lobby bar about 100 feet away.  That was a slight disappointment because that wine was VERY good.  We started by splitting a salad, but as I learned there is really no need to split as they are very small - as a starter, but are very good.  I could have easily eaten the whole thing myself.  I cannot remember the name, as I could barely pronounce it last night, but it has grilled red onion, spring mix, and macadamia nuts  - it was delicious.  They also serve bread with a very tasty and slightly citrusy olive oil for dipping.  

For my main course I ordered the penne pomodoro.  It came with lots of delicious minced bacon and mushrooms, along with an arugula salad on top.  It wasn't creamy like I was afraid it would be, but very good, with a slight kick to it.  I loved it.  My friend had the tortellini with buffalo mozzarella and she loved it, finished every bite.

We did not have enough room for dessert, but I bet it was great.  Overall, out meal was about $85 for the 2 of us, not too pricey, but not for everyday dining.  If you're looking for something different, I would highly suggest this for a night out.  You can get valet parking, start with drinks in the lovely hotel lobby watching the sunset and venture over to Alto.  And I almost forgot the best part...you get 2 free rides on the gondola with each meal.  Yes a gondola, like in Italy, where the gondoliers even sing to you.  I haven't gone yet, saving it for a romantic adventure - my friend and I decided it wouldn't be as romantic with the 2 of us."}
{"text":"Went here for Valentine's Day, I had no idea that they changed the menu specifically for this day. They made you order a four course meal that did not list the prices. I ended up spending $300 for two people. The food portions sucked, small portions for $150? Give me a break. Will never come here again."}
{"text":"5 Stars all around great location, ambiance, and service. As for the reason we came here the food 5 stars again. Alto is located Located inside the luxiourious Scottsdale Hyatt Regency which provides the perfect setting for such an exquisit restaurant experiance. We came with  a large party of about 20 and I have to say the service was excellent and everyone on the staff was attenetive and friendly. Sometimes when you came with larger groups it tends to overwhelm the staff and the service is compromised but not in this case. 

One of my favorite aspects of this restraurant is the setting. Not only is the restarurant very nice and modern. But the place is surrounded by plenty of outdoor seating and fire pits to enjoy a nice summer day. Great place to catch up with friends and enjoy a refreshing mojito outdoors"}
{"text":"Was disappointed with the food especially for the peice... Only thing that was good was the cheese and cured meat, but how hard was that =_="}
{"text":"Found this place from a coworker and my boyfriend flew into town for our anniversary, so I decided to book a reservation here for 2. This restaurant is amazing! The ambience was great and the food was delicious. My boyfriend and I tried the Chef's tasting menu which was a 4 course dinner for each of us. We were amazed and surprised with what the chef came up for each course. Every meal was spectacular. If you're in and hungry, the 4 course is not the way to go! Porportions are quite small and delicate if you're someone who has a large appetite. This restaurant is a little pricey so we bought a certificate before hand. Although, our minimum did not reach up to what was required to use the certificate, our waiter, Jay tried his best to help us. All the servers were extra friendly and helpful. For dessert, my boyfriend and I were supposed to get a plate each, but the chef was so caring enough, they made us a dessert tasting platter with many different types of dessert! I thought that was such a sweet gesture. The restaurant all in all has great ambience and hospitality! Most likely will come again for a special occasion. 

P.S: Antipasti are great and afforadable! 

&A complimentary gondola ride is given when buys an entree at Alto's! Great experience and is fun. The gondola man and the gondola greeter was super friendly and nice! :)"}
{"text":"Just ok - nothing worth going back for. My wife liked her meal but mine was not so great. The noodles were all stuck together so it was a giant glob of dough and the shrimp were overlooked and very tough. I brought it to the waiters attention but he didn't make it right.

It was our anniversary and I thought this would be a good place to go for ambience but they put us right next to a large party so at times we could not even talk to each other. There was no one else in that part of the restaurant but we could hear a screaming baby in the other room. Definitely not the place for a quiet adult dinner.

We topped off the evening with a gondola ride but I don't think it will ever bring us back to the Alto."}
{"text":"Service was deplorable.  You could never find the waiter, and he was inept when you could locate him.  The antipasto choices sounded good but were not, and the servings were microscopic. The main courses were tasty but by then we were too pissed off to care.

Too bad, it is a pretty place."}
{"text":"We came back to Alto's tonight for dinner.  Our server was Jay.  The place was pretty empty til around 7:30.  It was a bit cold in the restaurant since only half of the place was opened, they had closed the other half off.  Our first experience was way better.  We started with some anti-pasta - sheep's milk cheese and roasted tomatoes with burrata mozzarella cheese.  They were just okay, nothing to write home about.  Then we had the fried eggplant which was smothered in more burrata mozzarella and was very very good both the eggplant and the melted cheese.  We drank hot tea, but the waiter kept having to refill the tea pots because the water was never really brought hot steaming hot and cooled off really quick in the slightly cold restaurant.  We also could not read the menu's because it was too dark, they were able to bring us mini flashlights to help us see the menu which they graciously let us keep after dinner.  I had the special, I wish there was more than one special but tonight the special was wild caught halibut from the coast of California.  It was a bit dry and I needed 1/2 lemon and some tarter sauce for the dryness, it came with a side of roasted mini squash which were not very pleasant tasting, mini carrots which were sweet and tasty, onion which was quiet tasty and baby tomatoes along with very hard more than al dente fettucine which was stuck together with garlic and olive oil.  I also have the tomato, mozzarella and basil salad which I had to send back since it was un-edible due to having way to much salt, they did bring me one with no salt.  Then I had the basil infused custard, which was just okay, I would not order anything on the menu I had tonight again except for the eggplant starter.  The first time we went we were told there was no soy in the chocolate, and today we were told there is soy in the chocolate, this could explain why last time I had a massive headache and stomach ache after eating there since I had the chocolate for dessert....The waiter Jay was great and they did take the items we sent back or had a problem with off the bill.  But something was off with them tonight and the food was just okay, nothing to write home about.  I wish it had been as wonderful as our first time there, but it wasn't and we were left disappointed in the food.   For the four of us with 2 glasses of wine, 2 anti-pasta, 1 appetizer, 2 salads, 1 bowl of soup, 4 entrees, 2 cups of tea and 3 desserts plus we had a $25.00 off coupon the bill with tax was over $150."}
{"text":"My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt for our one year anniversary. We've had he pleasure of eating at some very fine restaurants in the world and I've got to be honest, this was perhaps the best single meal we've ever had. The lobster fritters are absolutely mouth watering. My wife had the spicy pappardelle which she said was unbelievable and I had the baked ziti with short rib which was so good I didn't even offer her a taste. Seriously I'm not falsely hyping this place, it's just simply that good. Is it cheap? No, but don't complain about the pricing and just enjoy your meal. 

Lastly, Erin was a wonderful waitress. Really made us feel special and took amazing care of us. 

If we are ever back in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area we will absolutely be back"}
{"text":"Our server Tommy was great! Gave great recommendations. Try the procuttio and the  salami he suggested was amazing!!"}
{"text":"We had a great time at Alto Ristorante last evening, an enjoyable experience, and we will probably be back for a special occasion or with visitors.  Then why just three stars?  There was a problem -- read on.

First, the setting is beautiful, especially from the outside tables.  The service is attentive and competent, although I could quibble and say that it was a bit slow (2 1/2 hours for dinner) but this is an experience and not just a meal.  And, although our servers came by often to ask if everything was alright, they totally disappeared between times so when we did need something, we had to wait.  Where do they go?  But even so, the ambiance was 5* and the service was 4 or 5*.  So what's the problem?  Read on.

The menu is extensive enough to provide so many choices that your problem will not be finding something you like but making a selection.  Consider the antipasto for example.  You are given a checklist of about 25 cheeses, meats, bruscheta, and various other varieties at about $5 each.  Pick the ones you want and they compose the plates and bring them to your table along with creditable bread, two homemade jams, olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Each of the four we tried was very good; three were superb (pecorino cheese, burrata bruscheta, mixed olives).  We were really looking forward to our main courses.  Still 5*, so what's the problem.  Coming up - read a bit further.

Let me also mention that the Gondolino dessert (a creme brule with berries and a cookie gondola) was really great.  And the prices here are definitely not unreasonable - entrees running around $25. But ... here it comes ...

Our two main courses were poorly prepared.  I had the bronzino, a small sea bass, and it was overcooked badly and virtually unseasoned.  The accompaniments were fine but did not work well with the fish.  The filet mignon was ordered medium and came out lightly but properly charred on the outside but raw on the inside.  We sent it back with a suggestion to butterfly it, but the cook decided to just toss it back on the grill for a minute or so on each side.  This resulted in over-charring the outside, but in that short time, the center did not have a chance to cook any further -- the worst possible solution.

So the problem is that we have a truly 5 star restaurant, with everything going for it, but with at least one line cook who was thoroughly incompetent or had a real meltdown last evening.  Maybe when you go someone else will prepare your meals.  I hope so."}
{"text":"Awful service. Very bland, small portioned food for the cost. Would not go back. Very over priced for what you get and the quality. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"While the food and drinks were 5 star, the service was terrible. Our waiter, Philip, seemed overwhelmed at times by his 5 sat tables. Myself and a few work friends had dinner and a drink each and when we asked to split the bill he went in to a long speech about how 'hard' it is for him to split checks, it would take 15-20 minutes and he would need to get a managers approval. Once the bill came, there was a $50 bottle of wine on our tab that our table hadn't ordered. As someone who has worked in the restaurant/service industry for over a decade I was shocked at the terrible service.

Update: it's now been 20+ minutes since he took our bills back to correct. We still haven't been given correct checks, let alone paid."}
{"text":"Good food and excellent service. My wife really liked her olive and cheese plate, and caprese salad. My pasta was good, and the risotto very nice."}
{"text":"How is it that I've had my best Italian at a Hyatt which beats the mom-and-pop joints back home that claim to have Italian grandma's recipes? So glad the prospect of the complimentary gondola rides made us choose to dine at Alto on site. 

Everything from a cup of tea to the bread and butter, from the best appetizer (bruschetta, unique and versatile) to the most delicious handmade pasta with the most amazing sauce, and ending with eye-popping desserts... the entire fine dining experience was exquisite!

The service was top notch too! Now I understand why the servers all exuded confidence - you can't get anything wrong here! When we asked for more bread and butter but not end up finishing all, they happily packed them up for us to enjoy the next day. After we had finally decided on one dessert having difficulty of choosing, they brought us a freebie chocolate one from a party that was going on at the hotel, apparently they made too many of them but still, how nice!

Having a meal at Alto was the cherry on top for our stay at this Hyatt!"}
{"text":"the place is very pretty and intimate. the whole hotel is gorgeous. I had some pasta with shrimp and tomato and it was great! 
get the gondolino desert which is a delicious plate of creme brule. tok big for 2. This is a desert for 3 people.
With dinner here you also receive a ticket for the gondola ride which was very romantic. they sing you in Italian and the whole deal. This made my date's night. she said it made her feel like she was on The Bachelorette."}
{"text":"Well we walked in, they had lost our reservation despite by girlfriend calling ahead and being a platinum hyatt member (this was supposed to be my birthday dinner). We still decided to give it a chance, and sat at our table...waiter didn't show up for 17 minutes (having worked in the restaurant industry I notice these things). We finally walked out and were offered two free drinks for the terrible service, what a joke. I'm still baffled that we could not get service...the restaurant was not even half full. The resort is wonderful, unfortunately Alto is not."}
{"text":"It is quite overpriced for the food. Beautiful setting within Hyatt hotel. The menu is limited and they do get quite busy therefor the service could be slow."}
{"text":"Came here with my family and had dinner. Food was good but to little of it on the plate but that's not why I gave a low review. Had to do with the servers. I came to a high end restaurant and paid big bucks. The server didn't assist us with any napkins till we asked at the end of the meal when we needed them. Also asked for lemons to go with the salmon special and never got them but did feel asking a second time and waiting for them while my food was getting cold cuz it was chilly out. Other then that prices range from 21-30 bucks a plate good food. Very nice resort! Good hang out for a Friday night or Saturday with live music"}
{"text":"Unless you are a regular or look like your wallet is fat don't expect the best service.  Entrees cost about 20-38 bucks and Anti pasta runs between 5-20 desserts are all 8 bucks unless you get aged balsamic vinegar.  They also have a big cheese selection. 

I made reservations for this restaurant and they sat us by the back door.  The waiter never once explained anything on the menu or suggested a wine to go with our meal.  He didn't even tell us about the cheese menu except to check on the one we wanted.  The other waiter for a table near ours went out of his way to explain the menu and go as far as to tell his tables how to eat the cheese ( it comes with jelly's and such) .  

My meal was good I had the duck.  She had the salmon which tasted very fishy.  Not fresh at all.  The wine was 40 bucks for a carafe ( maybe if we would have got a 100 dollar bottle we would have gotten better service)  The Dessert was good it was a rich chocolate cake with nuts and chocolate sauce. Nothing too special.  

Overall the experience made the meal not worth the 115 bucks in these times not to mention they overcharged my girls card for the drinks at the bar.  If we dont want to give 25% don't charge it plain and simple.  

Just a warning reservations and customer service mean nothing.  We mentioned our complaints to the waiter and manager.  We received an apology but how bout comp our dessert or something.  Hyatt Gainey staff is also rude for the most part.  

Two thumbs way down."}
{"text":"Okay we came here mainly for the dessert The \"Gondola\" it's their version of the creme brûlée  and yes it's still the best ever ,  we also had a appetizer and a salad  which the salad was great but the scallop stuffed calamari  just didn't cut it it , maybe it's just to opposite textures  the rubbery calamari and the scallops that they did something to them like mashed them up  to a foam the texture. If it wasn't for a tasty sauce  this dish would of had no taste what so ever., their dinner menu had nothing on it that really appealed to me .  The service was excellent ."}
{"text":"Wife and I ate there on March 26th 2015 for our 6th yr anniversary.  It is pricey but we had a restaurant.com cert.  Very nice place.  We ate outside. Beautiful.  We had to walk alittle to get thru to the restaurant itself.  Wife ordered the veal.  She said it was bland, too much breading, too lemony and not enough seasoning.  I ordered the sausage stuffed ravioli.   Best ravioli I've ever had.  It was al dente.  I'm use to soft ravioli.  Al dente is so much better.  The sausage stuffing was very good.  For dessert they gave us for free their signature creme brulee which is basically burnt custard, but it was damn good.. it came with a wafer edible gondola boat with the ends and the bottom of the boat dipped in chocolate ,  dessert wafer type sticks resembling the oars dipped in chocolate, sorted berries.  Very good.  And after dinner (no coupon needed) u get a free gondola ride for 2 along their waterway with a trained singer who sings an Italian song and rows at the same time.  It was very romantic and a nice end to the evening.   Don't forget to tip your boater/singer.  I tipped him 20$(10$ a piece(wife&I).   
When I made the reservation(required), I let thm know it was our wedding anniversary.   She said she would note that, but when we got there nobody said nothing to us including our waiter and we had to let him know later on... the service was great but it did take a while to get our check.  I had to waive my arms to get his attention.  One other complaint is although the gratuity was included, we we're chrgd another 18% even though the receipt had the correct chrg.  When we got home, my wife chkd our account and discovered the error.  She called them right away and the manager told us whn using a restaurant.com cert, the gratuity is automatically added but their computer does not recognize the gratuity already added on and double chrgd the cc another 18%.  (I even threw in an extra 10$ cash tip on top of their 18%) and if my wife hadn't looked at our account the server would have gotten 36 percent tip plus the $10 cash tip...... the manager reassured us it would automatically credit at the end of the day.  It did but it took a few more days to credit back to our account.  Food:  Ravioli was excellent.  Do not order the veal.   Service: good.  Ambiance: Great.  Gondola ride: Great.  Would I return?  Yes with a restaurant.com cert but make sure you check your account if using a restaurant.com cert and paying with a cc to make sure your not charged double tip.  I guess this is an ongoing problem is what they said.  This sounds like and easy fix by updating the computer. ."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Alto for our one year anniversary. It was an excellent choice. The server was extremely attentive, but not overbaring. He really knew his stuff about the food! We decided against the wine because we felt it was extremely overpriced. But they had a very large selection. We received a free dessert for our anniversary. It was very sweet. 
My only complaint with the restaurant was that we were hoping for a relatively quiet, romantic atmosphere. It was rather noisy and not as intimate as we hoped. We requested to not be seated near children, and they honored our request. We really appreciated that. However, at the beginning of the meal there were children running around and making noise. Eventually the management got them to go back to their seats and the restaurant manager personally apologized to each table in our area.
The gondola ride after the meal was a great touch. Very romantic. And our gondolier had a great voice. All in all it was a very nice evening. I would definitely recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"Lovey dinner at a beautiful resort.  Christoph provided great service, and was very helpful describing items on the menu.  My favorite part of the meal was braised short rib and gnocchi.   Beautiful dish!"}
{"text":"Me and my girl have stayed at the Gainey for the last four years for our shared birthday. We decided to finally eat here. Made reservations and away we went. 

Booker, our server, was amazing! Funny, knowledgeable and prompt. Never had an empty glass. 

I had the gnocchi and my girl had the halibut. Both on Booker's recommendation. Couldn't go wrong with a servers suggestion. The gnocchi were little pillows of goodness with pork belly and vegetables. Perfect. The halibut was flaky and tender. 

The service, again, was top notch. Food amazing."}
{"text":"My wife and I celebrated our anniversary there last night and it was pretty good.  The service was fantastic, the food was decent, and the drinks were OK, but the place is way over priced.  We ordered a salad, side, entree and 2 drinks each and the bill was over $200. I wouldn't have had a problem paying $100 or maybe even $150 for dinner, but the whole thing just came in to high.  If you're staying at the hotel like we were (remember, it's our anniversary), then it's probably OK.  If you're not though, hit one of the usual suspects like Ruth's Chris, Ocean Club, or Mastro's.  You'll spend the same amount and get a better meal."}
{"text":"I live in Chicago, so it's hard to top Italian food here.  For the most part, the food was really good.  The cheese selection was especially delicious.  My main issue was with the service.  I'm not sure if it was the chef or the waiter, but one of them didn't understand our questions/requests.
- We ordered a cheese flight but received a single piece of the wrong cheese (the waiter thought we ordered something else)
- I asked if any of the cheeses were not pasteurized (I'm expecting).  The waiter came back and said \"I'm sorry.\"  I said \"What?\" and he repeated \"I'm sorry.\"  I stared blankly and he clarified \"No.\"  I said \"No, what?\" and he said \"None of the cheese are pasteurized\".  I told him I didn't actually want any unpasteurized cheeses.  That was an actual conversation that took place.
- I ordered the pasta di parpadelle e salsiccia speziata italiano (parpadelle with sausage).  I asked if I could have the parpadelle dish with red sauce instead.  The waiter said \"well, then it won't be papardelle\".  I told him that I still wanted the parpadelle dish - just with a different sauce.  When the dish was delivered, it was parpadelle noodles with a red sauce, but none of ingredients from the original dish.  The waiter thought perhaps the kitchen staff misunderstood.  They brought me the new dish within 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  The prices are very reasonable for the amazing quality.  We sat outside and it was so romantic with the fire pits going. The service was good too. A little bit slow at times but it was fairly busy. We were completely fine with that though and enjoyed the great drinks. A little hard to find but staff at the resort was so friendly so that wasn't even really an issue!  

Defiantly will go back and experience it again and do the gondola ride!"}
{"text":"If you don't know amazing food when it hits you in the mouth, then you wouldn't have seen the expertise and great hands behind this restaurant.

We dined here while we were staying at the resort, but I'll be back as many times as my wallet (or his) can handle. But I do hear you on the prices, for me though, was worth it. I had one of the best meals of my life.

P.S. It's on restaurant.com and you can find a coupon for 1/2 off 

Our server was Jay, and every nice comment you hear about a waiter in theses reviews is probably about him. He was extremely knowledgeable, and was so attentive and friendly. The service alone was highly ranked. 

We ordered the antipasti plate, I recommend that you let the chef pick for you. We were nothing but amazed at the cheeses, asparagus, and shrimp.

We both had a salad, which were very good. He had the duck, and told me he never wanted to eat anything else. I had the pasta carbonara, and it was good, but not the highlight of the meal. 

Over all, I can't speak highly enough of my regard for this place. We will be coming back very soon, and we will also be calling ahead to see if Jay will be working that night. 

By the way, the patio dining (in cool weather) is the way to go."}
{"text":"While everything at the Hyatt Resort at Gainey Ranch was excellent, Alto was not. I was told that the bone-in ribeye was excellent, but it proved to be a long way from that description. I found the steak to be a poor cut of beef and while it was cooked medium rare, it was burned on one side. The staff as with the rest of the resort was friendly and did a wonderful job. A short cab ride to a number of well known steak places would prove to be a better choice. A $100 meal should be very good. You will not have that here."}
{"text":"Came for restuarant week and very happy i did. The scenary is beautiful and the food was great too. I had the aranchini and filet. Very elegant place and would definitely return again. Bonus, there are complementary gondolla rides!!"}
{"text":"Alto Ristorante was delicious! My husband and I split two unique and exquisite pastas! Our waitress surprised us with an adorable themed dessert to celebrate our one year anniversary of marriage! She also gave us our complimentary tickets to the gondola boat ride which was a perfect way to end our romantic evening!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here for an anniversary when we first met and then again for our two year anniversary and I love love love this place!! We chose to do the chef's tasting menu with wine pairing, it was pricey but totally worth it.  We got a total of 5 courses and each course was amazing, from the taste, presentation.  The servers knew so much about each dish and were so knowledgeable.  They were able to explain each dish and how it was made, what was in it.  The wines were delicious also, although I got pretty drunk by my 3rd glass and course meal.  The dessert was fantastic.  I did want a little more privacy but we were sitting by an old couple and surrounded by other couples.  The inside dining area was not that big but it was still nice.  The resort itself was beautiful to walk around.  and to top it off with a gondola ride and they sing to you, its just an all around great experience."}
{"text":"Super amazing service, delicious fresh food, nice staff, lovely place. Best place to impress your date or your beloved. 
A little pricey but it is worth it. 1 appetizer, 2 glasses of wine, 2 main courses together came up to about 100 bucks so be prepared for that."}
{"text":"This is surprisingly a very good restaurant. Not just for a resort restaurant, but even compared to the other great restaurants in the area. The dishes here are elegant that will please even the most sophisticated palette. The wine could use a little work, but is still acceptable. Service was great, nothing to complain about so that is all I ever ask. If you are staying here def give it a try. If you aren't, I would still say its worth the effort since it has such a beautiful backdrop with patio seating and live music trickling over from the lobby area."}
