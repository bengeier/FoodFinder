{"text":"The most unauthentic Afghani/Pakistani/Indian food I've ever had. I bought the Nihari recently and it didn't look or taste anything like one. It just tasted like a normal beef curry. No thickness to the gravy, no tenderness to the meat, even the onion on the side wasn't the crispy caramelized version it's supposed to be. The gravy was also not consistent like it should be. It looked like it was stored frozen and heated up for me. Which brings me to the next point. Why does it always take 15 minutes to serve any item? If the food was made fresh everyday, it would be in a big pot waiting to be served but that doesn't seem like the case here. Not gonna knock on the naan because it's next to impossible to find the authentic Afghani naan in Canada and this is no different. The price they charge for the amount of food is okay, but the quality is just not there.  The one extra star is because the staff is polite and the place looks clean."}
{"text":"Over priced for what you get. Utensils are dirty and the portions are little. This place was amazing and has gotten much worse, what a shame."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place on my way back from shopping  downtown. Yonge street was mobbed so I wandered over to Church St. to beat the crowd. So glad I did. My tummy was hungry, I saw Kabul Express from the distance and thought SCORE! Kebabs! I was pleasantly surprised by items on the menu. This was the most expansive desi meat centric menu I've seen in Toronto to date. Several goat options - which I LOVE (keema and karahi are the two I remember), Haleem, Nihari, lamb chops, fish, vegetarian curries -- so much yumminess. I went with a Chapli Kebab platter and goat keema. I echo the sentiment of others that this is not 'express' take-out, but I don't mind waiting for made-to-order food. For me the kebab, keema and rice were all fantastic. Just the right amount of spice for me -- which might be too spicy for others if you aren't used to spice. This is not a fancy place, but it is clean and there are several tables where groups can sit and enjoy a meal together. As a bonus, the prices are very very reasonable. I'll certainly be coming back!"}
{"text":"Kabul Express is a fast food restaurant serving Afghan and middle eastern inspired cuisine.  I go many times per week and tend to gravitate towards the special of the day - seasoned rice, salad, and a meat item of some description (usually a kabob).  Service isn't McDonald's fast, but I appreciate that food is cooked to order so it is always fresh.  There is seating available but it isn't exactly the best ambiance.  I wish the portion size was a little bit bigger, but that's about my only criticism.  Bottom line is that you can get a good tasting meal for 5 or 6 bucks in 5 or 6 minutes."}
{"text":"Food made to order, generous portions, friendly staff. A great place to go if you're looking for some nice comfort food, that has a homemade feel. The service isn't fast food quick, but you won't be waiting more than 15 min for foood"}
{"text":"Well priced, good portions but inside the restaurant isn't the cleanest - to go is ur best bet!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. Best Naan in the city! We love the Tandoori Chicken and the Kofta. One meal can feed two people or make one person reeally happy."}
{"text":"Came here last week, the place was quite packed.  we ordered the tandoori chicken platter and the sultani kebob platter. Both came with rice, salad, naan and this lentil soup.  Both were flavourful and tender...very good.  I love the little red sauce they give you on the side (sooo good). Prices were good too.  only con was that there weren't enough tables to sit. They should think about getting more tables for 2's rather than 4's because a lot people were either in pairs or couples and they were sitting at big tables for 4, so when other people came in they either had to share tables kinda awkwardly or wait until someone was finished."}
{"text":"the food is excellent , next time i will be in Toronto for sure i'm going there. the place is verry clean"}
{"text":"It's so nice place,casual,simple,good so delicious,owners are so friendly, I make sure every time visit toronto to try it at least ones .."}
{"text":"Had the chicken tikka plate. Cooked and marinated to perfection! The place is clean and they cook the food in front of you. A plate comes with rice, soup, fresh clay oven naan. I also had a glass bottled Miranda after 25 years! I'm going back again."}
{"text":"Awesome food, fast service and always fresh... Try their spicy and flavorful chicken wings"}
{"text":"One of the best spots in Toronto for delicious Afghani / Pakistani food! Kebabs, Nihari, Kahari, Haleem are all great. Naans are baked fresh. They just renovated and expanded as well, so the space is much nicer and bigger now."}
{"text":"Prices are unreasonable and portions are very small. Just walk down to King Place, better tasting food with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The food is clean, healthy and tasty. The kebabs taste good although the rice tastes bland. The staff are alright, a couple of them are nice and a couple of them are not so nice. Also, they've started charging 50 cents a piece for some extra sauce which was never the case before. IMHO not a fan of the sauce cost but the food is decent."}
{"text":"If i could rate this place as a -star,very dishonest place and poorly disorganized! Waited for 28 mins for a chicken tandori kebab special which should include naan and lentil soup as it shows on the monitor but when I got it..only chicken,rice,salad,plus 2 sauces BUT no naan or Lentil soup. My colleague order the same \"Special\" but only got 1 sauce and when he asked for the yogurt sauce , he was told that only 1 sauce is given. He asked about the naan and lentil soup, the worker commented that it's not part of the \"Special\"...so what is included in the \"Special\"??? Do not go there at any cost!!!"}
{"text":"Visited this place last week as it was a walking distance from my hotel.  The place is OK but the food is great.  The place is kind of small and it was busy when I visited but I really enjoyed their Chicken Wings and would be coming back for it.  However, next time I will have the order to go as it is a bit hassle to find a table for one."}
{"text":"I have been going here for 5+ years. I still love their quality but, ONLY FOR DINNER. The lunch staff is not as competent as the dinner staff. I still recommend this place to everyone for dinner as the chef's are great people who have passion for quality food."}
{"text":"The food wasn't good but wasn't bad either. I would have given 3 starts but the guy on the cash who seemed to be the owner has a lot of attitude. When you are in business you treat your customers nicely and with respect otherwise I would take my business else where. Also, the name is Kabul express which is the capital of Afghanistan but the food is not authentic afghan food neither the owner of afghan descent. The people of Afghanistan take great pride in their food and hospitality both of which were lucking."}
{"text":"We have monthly staff lunches, and I'm responsible for deciding where to order from. Been to Kabul Express once, thought it'd be a great place for my colleagues to try. Stopped in the day before to make my order for 22 ppl.  Food was personally delivered to our address on time, everything was neatly packed and the order was correct according to my specifications.  We ordered grilled beef tikka & kofta, grilled chicken breast & kofta, basa fish fillet, daal chana & tandoori chicken legs.  Rice, salad, nan bread, sauces, cutlery & napkins were included with the meals.    Their food is fresh & made to order.  All the meats were super tasty and the rice was well made.  Food was well marinated, the seasoning, spices and softness of the meat was on point. People were going up for second helpings that I was afraid that there would be no leftovers for my lunch the next day!    We paid a very fair price (very generous portions) for all that was included, which left some extra funds to order a big cake from a local bakery.  Great customer service, management was professional, restaurant is well organized.  Would definately recommend to others, will definately order from Kabul Express again.  Every single person loved the food, everyone wanted to know where the food was ordered from, now I'm the office hero :P"}
{"text":"When you are in the mood for tasty kebabs, conveniently located, this is my go-to place for takeout!  There is an option with salad and naan, the Sultana is chicken and beef is a good choice of mixed platter.   The lamb stews are tasty but greasy. The stewed lamb isn't always available...  Be prepared to wait if it's around dinner time. I recommend calling in your order first! :)"}
{"text":"Super authentic! Even the rice is great, I destroyed it, even though I usually skip rice. Beef and chicken were great and juicy. Was quality meat. Place is clean and spotless."}
{"text":"After hearing alot of great recommendations about this place my boyfriend decided to try it out. first walking in a didnt know what to expect. there was quiet a few people in there which is a good sign. slightly unclean. possibly that just finished a small rush so maybe they had not cleaned up yet. we ordered some beef kofta and chaplee beef, and butter chicken. the beef kofta and chaplee was great no complaints. rice and naan was great. the butter chicken on the other hand, not so much. all i could taste was cream. the chicken in the butter chicken was great. it was the sauce that was over powering with cream. i will try this place again. but maybe not the butter chicken."}
{"text":"Decent food, chicken leg platter is on point, kabobs could be better tho. Had butter chicken as the gravy side, tasty... naans are decent. I would recommend it !!!"}
{"text":"Tasty, clean, and Halal resturant. Good food. Little costly for such a small, not well arranged place."}
{"text":"Food was ok. You guys should have everything on one menu. Not just kabobs on the menu and the nahari on the board."}
{"text":"This place has the best chicken Karhai and Daal Makhni in Toronto..... The service is very fast and food is always fresh."}
{"text":"I've been here over 10 times and I usually order the butter chicken which is great. The only downside is that it usually only has 3 or 4 small cubes of chicken in it."}
{"text":"I love the menu they offer. Their portions are quite big and they are priced reasonably well. The spices they add are excellent and is a great compliment with the rice and salad. Their kebabs are delicious and the hot sauce is fantastic."}
{"text":"One of my regular go-to places in the area. I have been frequenting this restaurant, mainly for take away, for the last three years and will likely do so as long as I live in the area.   I have not tried a wide variety of dishes, but the Tandoori Kebab Dinner and Sultana Kebab Dinner are two must haves! They also make a fantastic Biryani, but it it not available all day so try that out if you are looking for a satisfactory, filling lunch.   That about sums up this place... Great taste and quality, and at a very good price."}
{"text":"Excellent food for the price. We had palak paneer, daal Chana, and chicken wings. Ordered medium spicy, which was on the hotter end than expected, but fine and delicious for us. Helpful guy at counter. Thank you."}
{"text":"The quality has gone down, and the prices gone up. What is listed as 7$ is actually 13.50, what is listed as 9$ is 14$. There are no more wraps, and the flavors have changed. I'm disappointed because this was the best, and it is no longer. It must be under different management, with different tastes, prices and menu. It's unfortunate because this used to be amazing! Now I do not recommend it, you're just as good to go anywhere else"}
{"text":"Came for lunch around 1:30pm hoping to beat the crowd. People were on their way out but there were dirty trays and left over food everywhere. After brining up other people's tray after ordering, noticed people were getting their food after me and those who got food before me.   Waiting for 45 mins in a filthy restaurant is definitely a good reason NOT to come back. Thank goodness there's a Burrito Boy's just up the street!"}
{"text":"When I see butter chicken and kahari options, I wondered if this is really an Afghan place. But I'm not complaining. The food was good. They may not have a waziri option, and their naan bread is shaped differently from other Afghan places, but good food is good food.   I had the Sultani kebob combo. Comes with rice, salad, kebobs, sauce, soup, and a massive piece of naan bread. Massive portions, and tastes good. Excellent value. All this food for just $12.49?!? Wow. I'm coming back. I eat a lot and I struggled to finish.   The kebobs were grilled right, especially the tenderloin skewer. Meat was tender and juicy. Not overcooked. The spices seemed a little different from other Afghan places but it was delicious. The kofta was...like kofta. Which is good. The soup is an unusual touch for an afghan place but very welcomed. The bread was fresh. You may notice you get less pieces of meat per skewer, but this is compensated by very large pieces.  I will definitely be back. It's a reasonable walk from Eaton Centre."}
{"text":"So . . . my traveling companion told me not to say this, but here's the thing, it really looks like a bomb went off in Kabul Express . . . which might be an accurate depiction of Kabul. There, I said it. Sorry for the constant war, Afghanistan. The food and service is pretty good, though (although we did spot one of the workers pouring water that some diner left back into the pitcher--wasn't my pitcher though, so I didn't care). Also, there was a weird dearth of women in the restaurant. For a good while, I was the only vagina owner on the premises (of course, in fairness, gender is a spectrum and I didn't check, and blah blah blah). None of that takes away from the fact that the food is quite delicious, and you should partake of it."}
{"text":"Place worth a try. The food is decent but beware that the protein portion is smaller than expected...for dt pricing it is reasonable. We had a butter chicken combo and goat curry. The combo came with delicious rice and side salad and naan. The chicken was grilled prior to being cooked in the sauce which only added to the flavour (unfortunately we only got about 4 small pcs of chicken). The sauce was flavourful and creamy, needed a dash of salt for my taste...but it paired perfectly with the rice. As for the goat curry, it was a very small bowl and a small salad for the price $10+, it did not come with any carb and was ordered separately. It was good but I wouldn't reorder knowing the portion for the price. Overall, the meal was acceptable. They seemed to be a popular choice, especially for late night as they are opened until 2am each day."}
{"text":"Ordered a bunch of food from here for take out. Not sure why the other reviews are saying it is so good. Malai tikka kabobs were really chewy and had little flavor. Chapli Kabobs were very gamy tasting.  Ras Malai tasted old. Service was friendly, but the food just wasn't good."}
{"text":"We love this place. It is always our go-to comfort food spot. The lamb shanks and tandoori chicken are my go-to items. The portions are generous. My star rating does not reflect service or ambience. Simply based on the food. Luckily, several months ago, they expanded the restaurant so there's more seating space now."}
{"text":"Great quantity of quality food for a liw price. Semi resturant style with semi servers. However it did take more than a while for food to arrive on my table"}
{"text":"Not gonna lie, I had Bamiyan the day before and I was still craving it. Thought I'd try kabul express and it totally hit the spot. Didn't wanna drive all the way to Eglinton to get my afghani fix and this was honestly a worthy substitute. Very very satisfied. Rice is as addictive as Bamiyan's for sure. It's near the downtown core/yonge-dundas so it was pretty convenient. Definitely will be back when I get the feeling for it again!!"}
{"text":"I was finally able to satisfy my curiosity after months of walking by this place day in and day out. This is a very unassuming place that gets quite busy in the evenings and lunch time but most of the time you might just walk right by it without evening noticing it.  I went with their tandoori chicken combo that came with soup, rice, salad and of course a big piece of naan. The chicken was very tender and it had a very unique snap to it as you bite it. Something that I have never really experienced before with chicken. The meat was lightly flavoured and quite spicy but I was able to manage. The rice was very well made and quite delicious. The soup and salads are nothing to really rave about but they taste fresh. The naan was also unremarkable but it was alright nonetheless.  I have to admit it was quite pricey as my lunch came out to be around $15 but understandably so considering the amount of food I got for my money.  All in all, a worthy place to drop in for lunch or dinner if you're craving for kababs. Not quite as flavourful as Bamiyan but still fresh and quite yummy."}
{"text":"Not a dry meat morsel in sight, everything here is juicy and well seasoned. My husband is obsessed with the tandoori fish, it's a huge, fresh, portion for a great price. I'm not in love with the naan here but it's still reliably well done and the rice is fragrant and delicious. I really encourage people to go support this spot, they've been doing good stuff consistently for maybe a decade."}
{"text":"I live close to this place and it's my go to for a kabob fix. My favourites are the chicken kafta or chicken malai, and the naan is good too!"}
{"text":"To be honest, this place is somewhat dirty, and I do not like how they cook meat.   Pamier Kabob on Spadina beats this place hands down.  Salad here is really sad and saggy.   The only good touch is the soup. Very few places serve it nowadays.  If you are a starving student this place is for you."}
{"text":"Simply put, not the best indian food in town (or not even good). Went here because a close friend who used to live in the area recommended it. Drove 20 minutes to get a take out for two and the food was very disappointing. The 9 dollar (large) butter chicken gravy was very watery and had 7 small pieces of chicken, the taste was mediocre (you know the sauce on the butter chicken makes the butter chicken butter chicken). this place is alright if you are around the area and don`t have a craving for good food, but if you want better indian food then I recommend you go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have a friend who lives around the corner. He uses this place as his go to 'healthy' food.   It's an Afghan resto serving its fare share of kebabs, rice and salad. I've tried the beef, fish and chicken.   Every time I've been here the food has been consistently delicious.   The wait times are long unfortunately due to its popularity around the clock.   However, the food you will receive will be delicious.   Bon appetite!"}
{"text":"Have tried their chaplee kababs, chicken biryani and boneless chicken. Decent place. Food is great. Come here often in lunch time. Chaplee kabab platter comes with daal soup, naan rice and salad. Naan and kababs are cooked fresh so hits the spot everytime."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago because it was 10:45pm and I was caught in a hunger pinch.  I was here before over 2 years ago and not particularly inspired to come back, but faced with diminishing late night options I figured what the heck.   The place looks much better than a couple of years ago and the service was on par for this type of joint,  I probably should have tried the Tandoori or Lamb this time around but I guess I was really tired & hungry and took the Kebab even though I didn't like it the previous time (and to be honest I never really enjoyed it at the two other Afghan joints I've been to...)   Once again I found it pretty dry and bland (being around since the 1970's I was having flashbacks of GOOD TIMES and JJ's jokes about Thelma's cooking...) Not say it was bad, just merely acceptable.  I also should have thought of asking to substitute the rice for extra Naan as another Yelper cleverly did - there is no food situaion which can't be improved by more Naan - my mistake there.  I'll give it 3 stars just because at the end of the day I respect how they cater to needs of  late night eaters with honest, made-from-scratch foods in good portions for a very fair price.  I don't recall exactly what I paid but it was very reasonable for the amount of food and considering the real estate they rent - however despite the value I somewhat regret the purchase."}
{"text":"My midnight craving place... This is the only halal place in Downtown Toronto where I usually go from 2013! The reason I go, because it's the only place which stays open till midnight! And quite good seating.. nice and moderate tasty foods. I heard it's authentic Afghani foods but always have been seeing Indian people are working on both sides.  On weekends and holidays , you gotta wait a lot for foods"}
{"text":"Super tasty afghan kababs, think half persian half indian on the spice palate.  The kebabs are delicious, the portions are generous, and the price is right.  Due to popularity, I do recommend ordering ahead of pick-up."}
{"text":"To be honest, I have never been a fan of Afghani or Indian food. I do not like curry anything and do not eat meat therefore, I usually stay away from that kind of food. My boyfriend took me to that place once for quick takeout and I was very scared until I actually tasted the food. I had the fish tandoori and it is amazing. I think I went back about 10 times since I first tried it a month and a half ago. The fish is amazingly seasoned and juicy. It is baked rather than fried which makes it healthier as well. The fish portion is huge as well. Great naan bread to accompany it, especially the garlic naan."}
{"text":"I am a fan ! I love my rice and chicken, and South Asian food, therefore its only natural I will gravitate towards this small joint on Dundas. The specials are often what I opt for because a student's budget is always tight! The specials are usually a stick of chicken or beef served on rice and accompanied by a salad. The rice is a buttery basmati rice coated with light spice, but very flavourful. The salad is usually tomatoes, lettuce and onions with yogurt dressing. The chicken is marinated is different spices and grilled. I posted a picture of the tandoori chicken. The lunch also comes with red salsa type sauce, and beware it is very very spicy and garlicy. I eat very spicy food and I find the sauce hot after two or three dips but it is so delicious that I just keep going. Good sweat after!"}
{"text":"Amazing food - people have said it takes too long but I disagree. Everything is made fresh to order and is ready in no more than 15/20 minutes.    Recommended dishes: chicken breast dinner, tandoori chicken dinner, tandoori chicken wings and butter chicken!! All very good!!"}
{"text":"I find lamb to normally to be gamy, however this lanb is awesome! This place is definitely authentic as there are 8 other tables here and I am the only non Afghan. A friend brought me here who was raving about the lamb, so I'm back for more lamb and going to try some tandoori fish and..."}
{"text":"Selective service. You can only get good service by how you look or by your background. Doesn't matter when you ordered you dish, you will be waiting a long time for your food while others after you get theirs. I assumed it's just a one time occurrence but more than once explains it all! There should be a CHRONOLOGICAL sequence to making orders not by biased selection! This 2018 in Canada!"}
{"text":"If ur looking for some bbq meat or kababs in downtown. Then this is a good place. There are definitely way better restaurants than this, I.e. when looking for kababs, but since we were looking for something in downtown .. we had to resort to this. We bought a 15$ platter which includes lentil soup which to be honest did not taste that great. We had bought chicken bbq and rice. We got it with some dry salad, pita bread and two kinds of sauces. The rice and sauces were amazing, the meat not so much. I was expecting it to be more juicy and hot but it was dry. We were three in total and bought an individual platter for ourselves which was actually too much. I would say that one platter will be sufficient enough for two. Overall, quite a good place, the restaurant is self-served."}
{"text":"GET THE WINGS!!!!!!!!!!   Came here for the first time today for lunch. Got 6 wings and salad. My friend got the chicken kebab, salad and naan. The wings were very good! They make their food fresh. You can taste it and it takes a while for them to bring you the food. I will definitely go back and try more of the dishes."}
{"text":"Almost good quality, cheap prices Variety of food types Homeless people are around, so sometimes they come inside for begging spare change By the way, overall it is value for money. So, I still recommend it as a place to eat dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to eat around work that tasted authentic and had good sauces to compliment the taste of the food. I found all of this at Kabul Express and I go there for lunch every day I am at work.   I would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"So so food. Wait times are more than 30mins if you go during the lunch time and to make it even worse they often mess up your order and you wait like 45mins to get your food. It happened to us twice. If you work around there and want to eat in a reasonable time don't bother."}
{"text":"I like to eat south eastern foods and this was my first time trying out butter chicken. My friend recommended me to this place. I read on other reviews that for the special, you can ask for a substitute of a naan if you didn't want to ride. I did that and wow it was really good! Will definitely come back to try their other foods."}
{"text":"The food here is made to order so it is always fresh they use nice chunks of white meat for their chicken dishes and the tandori fish is amazing. They also use a whole wheat jasmine rice which is a nice change from white rice. The atmosphere is very casual reminiscent of more of a takeout place the cashier usually is a bit grumpy and contrary to its name it is not express."}
{"text":"Kabul Express is pretty poppin', and I'll go to bat for it without hesitation.  The main draw seems to be the kebabs, which are very reasonably priced and come with a TON of food. Your ~$10 kebab comes with a huge amount of tasty rice, some salad, pita bread, and even a bowl of soup. It's a nice contrast to places that charge $15+ for kebab and rice. Everything is really good, if not totally amazing.  Others have said the wait times are quite long - I haven't been in a while, but I'm pretty sure they're right."}
{"text":"Pretty good food here and the prices are reasonable for the amount of food you get. They make everything fresh to order so if you're in a hurry this is not the place for u. I ordered the butter chicken combo which comes with rice, salad, butter chicken and naan. I've seen the rice portions and they are huge so I asked for one extra naan instead of rice and it was no problem. I think I paid 12.70$ for the combo with a coke and I had atleast half remaining for leftovers."}
{"text":"I have visited this place twice and the food is average. There are other restaurants in Toronto where you can get more variety. The main thing that pissed me off was the guy at the counter. I have never experienced such a stupid and rude person. When I went up to the counter to ask for extra plates, this guy was so reluctant to hand me an extra plate. Anyways, when I went back to the table one of my friends told me that they also need an extra plate, so I went back to get one more. And then this guy says, ' We have already given you two plates in which you got your food, how many more plates do you want?! '. I was completely shocked at this and felt like punching him in the face. How can you fight with your customers over plates? I know this may sound kinda silly but it's absolutely pathetic! Moreover, I sometimes feel this guy only has a group of selected old regular customers to whom he pays attention to rather than focusing on giving good customer service to everybody present in the restaurant. This was my second and last trip to this restaurant ever. Horrible management!!"}
{"text":"Best nihari in downtown Toronto. The wings are great too. Food is fresh. Love this place."}
{"text":"This is more of a Pakistani cuisine than afghani. Yes they serve some afghani dishes but the Pakistani dishes are better. The chicken Karahi was very good. Their serving size was good. Their serve ware was good. Their service and bathrooms were good.  Their wings are amazing! Must try them. I have had them now almost every time I have gone The people are courteous and pleasant. This is a nice little place in town."}
