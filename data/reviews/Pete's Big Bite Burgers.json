{"text":"Just decided to try a \"fire grilled steak on a kaiser\" and I was not disappointed. My girlfriend and I are staying at a hotel here in Whitby and decided to try Pete's for the very first time.
Being an overcast day, we thought it was a great idea to get some takeout delivered. Pete's is close by and after checking out the Yelp reviews we phoned in our order.
The steak sandwiches and onion rings arrived promptly and were hot. I can honestly tell you.....I have never had a steak sandwich this good ever!
Steak was medium rare (as we requested) and tasted seasoned and fresh. Onion rings were made with real onions, not processed and the batter was salted perfectly.
I highly recommend Pete's when in town. We'll be trying their burgers next."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious! I'm always on the hunt for a great Poutine and this one never disappoints. Tried the veal on a bun recently and it was amazing!!! It was so good I had to write a review."}
{"text":"Seriously delicious burger great atmosphere and the service is fast and polite.Had the cowboy burger combo with fries great burger I am definitely going to be a repeat customer ,heard about the steak on a Kaiser that's next on my list!Gave this place 4 stars but don't take my word check it out for yourself  you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Went to the place for the first time today, and was schocked! But not at the food but the bill. Burgers were ok, but were done surprizingly quick. Toppings were delicious, and staff was friendly. Paid $22 for 3 burgers with cheese and one of them had bacon, a little overpriced considering I got no sides."}
{"text":"Hands down best burger joint in Durham.  Poutine is amazing. Burgers are well prepared, juicy, and a wide range of toppings to choose from. Not over-priced. Very friendly service. Cool retro diner atmosphere. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Best Burgers in Durham, 
as far as I am concerned. 
Pete is a Friendly and makes you feel like a regular even if you have only gone in once.
Fast and great service, especially since it can get very busy.
The restaurant is very clean, and the food is excellent. I would suggest anything on the menu it will all be to your liking.
Every burger and hot dog toppings are customized to what you want, as much or as little as you like. 
In addition to the great food, the Cruise Nights bring out a great mix of people and classic cars.

A must try location in Whitby."}
{"text":"Its not bad. Shake, Rabble & Roll down the street is better (IMO) . Pete's is touch and go....Sometimes its good, other times its not cooked well enough or burnt. The portions are good. And when the burgers are good... their REALLY good (they melt in your mouth)

All in all, not too bad. We're not overly crazy about the layout, its a bit cramped, and closed in (the dining room part of it) but love the 50's Diner decor. 
He's also got some great selection... Different things that you don't usually see at local establishments such as the Deep Fried Mars Bar and Mango Milkshake. 
Customer service-wise, Pete and the staff are always friendly and always glad to see the customers (unlike some other unmentioned local burger establishments) 
Pete's is definitely worth a try for anyone who hasn't been there."}
{"text":"Fantastic menu with lots of variety. Great prices. Friendly staff. DELICIOUS food!!!"}
{"text":"I used to come here quite often for their Fireman burger and all their different options... the last time I did I received a burger that was obviously on the grill for a while and reheated. Frozen patty. I really like the service here and my kids get a lollipop at the end of it. Milkshakes are good. The old man is nice. Ok food but I don't think I will return. Decor dated. Looking for fresh..travel west a few minutes on the north side. Updated diner with fresh burgers. Worth the drive. Sorry guys. Changes are required."}
{"text":"Pete's is close to where we've lived for 5 years, but we never went in until friends suggested how good it was. We were definitely not disappointed. The burgers were excellent and the fries were nice and crispy.  We used to go to Starr Burger, but not any more. Pete's is our new favourite burger place."}
{"text":"Holy Philly Cheesesteak! My parents and myself had a craving so we headed to Pete's. I'd never been. We got 2 combos and 1 sandwich alone. These cheesesteaks were HUGE! So much steak, peppers, onions and cheese that you can barely close the bun. Definitely need to cut it in half or thirds to even pick it up! There was a lot of fries, so 1 order of fries would've been ok for 3 of us. Fries come with gravy and it's pretty good. The sandwich itself was really filling, so we didn't eat many fries.

There's a few booths and tables, but not a big place. They also sell Kawartha Dairy ice cream! Service was pretty fast. Prices were reasonable for the amount of food we got."}
{"text":"It's a good spot. Burger patty was good and juicy but wasn't a fan of the 'firehall burger' toppings. I'd go back but probably after trying another spot."}
{"text":"I be been to Petes many times. Good burgers, great atmosphere. 
Steak on a Kiser, it's huge and very filling"}
{"text":"I had been to Pete's Big Bite Burgers a couple of times just after they had opened, & found it to be very inconsistent.  Today I went back for the first time in years, & even on one visit, I found it to be inconsistent.  Let me explain...

I got the 1/2 lb burger combo, which came to $10.49 with tax, & sat on one of the stools by the window to wait.  My burger was ready pretty quickly, since I had walked right up to the counter when I entered.

My burger was great - flavourful, juicy & cooked just right.  There was just the slightest hint of pink, & I truly enjoyed every bite.  The fries on the other hand, would've been mediocre even if they were hot.  They weren't cold, but they weren't hot, either.  They were bland, frozen fries that seem oddly out of place in a place that seems to take pride in their food.  On the bright side, all the combos include a complimentary side of gravy, which was good, because I wouldn't have been able to eat them without the addition of some vitamin G.  Pete's seems like the kind of place that should have fresh-cut fries, & their fries are the only thing keeping me from giving it 4 or 5 stars.

As far as ambience goes, you walk in & can't help notice the retro 50's decor - it's pretty cool looking.  The service was okay, but not anything special.  As far as I'm concerned, Big Boy's is still the best burger joint in Whitby."}
{"text":"Great Burgers and a CLEAN table!  Not something ever served up at the chains.

I hate having to clear away other peoples leftovers and crumbs from tables and chairs, and still paying a premium for it.  That's why I prefer mom and pop shops.

Definitely had a great burger meal here, great fries and gravy.  No cramps afterwards.

Had a basic 4oz combo and my husband had a 6oz fajita burger.  We both enjoyed our meals and pricing was very fair.

Also enjoyed all the interesting posters and memorabilia.  Great place to stop if you are in Whitby and need to eat.  It might even be worth the drive from Scarborough."}
{"text":"Impolite counter person, burnt food, brown edges on chopped lettuce, improper food handling, high prices for low quality food."}
{"text":"Another great burger place in Whitby!  Huge burger, lots of fries and onion rings.  Great service and friendly atmosphere.  If you know the area, Pete's is like a cross between Shake, Rabble & Roll and Mr. Burger.  The burger is very similar to Rabble, while the surroundings is similar to Mr. Burger with the 50's diner feel, only better.  Plus Pete's offers better burger toppings including a fried egg.

Rule of thumb.  If you find a burger place that offers a fried egg as a topping, chances are they make a great burger and you are in for a treat!  Be sure to try the Cowboy Burger and if you're up for the challenge get the 8 oz. size!!!

Pete's also has great Philly Steaks!  A good Philly Steak is very hard to find in Durham so I was very pleased that Pete's made a great Philly. (even better than the one I found a Retro Burger, see my other review).

The Philly Steak comes with fried onions, peppers and Swiss cheese.  I added fried hot peppers... awesome!

Overall, a fantastic experience and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in this place while riding through Whitby. Wasn't expecting to find a good Philly cheese steak here but was very happy with my meal. The Cheese steak was great and filling. With the meal they also hook you up with a ton of fries that were also great."}
{"text":"Great food, great guy. 
Also car shows in the parking lot during the summer!"}
{"text":"It's a decent fresh burger and good service. Certainly worth stopping for lunch if your in Whitby.

I am torn about giving it 3 stars or 4 so lets call it 3.5"}
{"text":"Pete's has the best milkshakes I have ever tried. They also give you gravy for free with fries, unlike some other diners; I really liked that. I also enjoy the music they play here. I feel comfortable staying and chatting, there's no need to rush for anything while at Pete's. If I'm looking for a hamburger, I come here."}
{"text":"It had been a while since we had Pete's, so for Friday night dinner, it was time to revisit an old favourite. 

This time I went big, got The Works burger combo, which is a half pound burger (!) with Swiss and cheddar cheese, mushrooms and fried onions and bacon... Oh. so. much. bacon. And of course, fries, gravy and a can of pop. This combo will run you 12.99 before tax, a STEAL given how big the burger is! 

I still can't believe I ate almost the entire burger. It was so good, i basically ignored my fries until I was halfway through the burger (and fries are my jam, so that's unusual!!). 

The burger itself was everything I'd been craving for the last few weeks. A real, thick, juicy burger that eats like a proper beef patty, none of this thin flimsy burger business you get at cheap fast food joints. They pile the mushrooms and onions on and then cover it with a slice of Swiss and a slice of cheddar (locks the mushrooms and onions onto the burger, must remember this next time I make burgers at home) and then it's topped with a MOUNTAIN of delicious fresh real bacon. So cheesy and so bacon-y, every single bite has tons and it was soooooo delicious!!

I get a lot of toppings (ketchup, mustard, garlic mayo, tomato lettuce and pickle!) so I expected it to be messy but the size of the burger and bun really held everything on. Beware if you get a smaller burger, it gets messy! 

Fries were better than I remember but the gravy was just kind of there, nothing to write home about. 

I'll be dreaming of that burger for the next few weeks.... Bacon mountains covered in Swiss and cheddar cheese... Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for a nice juicy burger as it has been awhile. I quickly turned to yelp and in my area this place popped up. I must admit I have driven by this place for years, and always thought to myself I should try it out one day..well that one day finally came.

I was quickly surprised when I walked in that this place had a very unique 50's diner theme, for some reason I thought it was only takeout. The decor in here is great!!

Order the 5oz burger combo. 

The staff was very friendly. While I was waiting for my food, u can clearly see the cook and what he was doing. Now.. I'm not a grilling expert by any means, but u really shouldn't be cooking burgers in flames, the burgers that were coming off the grill were all black...not sure why he continued to do that for 15mins.

Anyways my food came, black burger and all. The food was okay, nothing really special.

Unless u like that kind of decor, u can probably get better burgers elsewhere in Durham..like Baldwins in Brooklin."}
