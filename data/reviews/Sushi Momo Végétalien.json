{"text":"The portions and prices were horrible - $7 for two rolls was a particularly unfortunate point. The veggie tempura sushi (which I would never order at a non-vegan joint) was abysmal - spongy tempura, dry rice, completely lacking in  flavour. The other rolls tried to draw their inspiration from a variety of sources - Indian, Western, Mexican - but it was a classic case of being spread too thin; maple syrup and hibiscus in sushi is interesting, but the core components like the rice were neglected in the process. Overall, this definitely lived up (or down) to what I imagine happening when white hipsters try to make sushi.   1 extra star, though, for giving me the best poop I had in months."}
{"text":"Delicieux sushi!!! Pour la femme enceinte que je suis rien de mieux que l'option vegetalienne. Tres original et qui ne ressemble a rien que vous connaissez deja. Seul commentaires: on etait francophone et on a eu un menu en francais et l'autre en anglais on aurait aimer avoir deux menus en francais. L'autre commentaire et que tous lea sushis sont originaux et on a aucune idee a quoi ca ressemble ni des quantités. Mis a part ca merveilleuse experience et j'y retournerai tres certainement! Merci sushi momo d'assouvir la rage de sushi d'une femme enceinte"}
{"text":"***MAKE A RESERVATION WELL IN ADVANCE***  This place is extremely popular, we got turned away on our first attempt because we didn't have a reservation, but made one there on the spot for the following evening. Asked out of curiosity how the rest of the week looked, they were booked solid, so we got lucky that we were able to get in during out Montreal visit.  Okay, enough with the cautionary tale...  Two words, GOD DAMN. I kept saying those words, again and again after each bite. Their rolls are SO delicious.  Go with the \"Omakasé For Two\" (or any of the other \"deals\" where they pick the sushi for you). Suggesting this because they pick drastically different rolls, so you get a chance to really taste their creative spectrum in its entirety.  Kind of wild, but I was really impressed with the miso soup. Normally this is a boring preliminary dish that I enjoy, but there's nothing special. Not the case at Sushi Momo, their miso was so damn good.  For anyone wondering how this place stacks up against other well known vegan sushi restaurants, I'd be willing to go as far as saying Sushi Momo is better and more creative than our local gem, and vegan sushi tourist destination, Shizen."}
{"text":"C'est probablement l'endroit le plus prisé de Montréal côté sushi car leur qualité et l'immense menu fais saliver. Lors de ma première visite, on m'a offert des edamames en entrée gratuitement alors ce fut grandement apprécié. Ils étaient également très bons!  Il faut cependant planifier et réserver car il y a beaucoup de gens même très tard le soir. Le service est somme toute rapide et on a toujours été très attentif et attentionné lors de mes visites."}
{"text":"I was never a fan of sushi because even as a non-vegan the idea of raw fish was very unappealing to me... but now that I'm vegan I'm always on the hunt for delicious vegan cuisine so Sushi Momo was my introduction to sushi and did not disappoint!    I went with some (non-vegan) girlfriends on a Saturday night to celebrate my birthday and from the moment we walked in the door we felt welcome and were blown away by the ambience and the service.  The staff are friendly and the decor is eclectic, Asian, chic and cozy. We were seated a little towards the back at the perfect table tucked into a corner for a group of boisterous girls ;-)  We were well taken care of by the charming Jonathan, who started us off with warm saki and then suggested the perfect wine and the Saiko Ko for Four from \"Les Deals\".  This four-course menu included a sumptuous miso soup to start, which the girls loved.  I subbed for a small salad instead and feel like I went to heaven when I tasted the ambrosia that was the dressing.  Then we had a yummy papaya salad & beetroot tartare and we also ordered some dumplings (Gyoza) all of which disappeared in a flash.  The portions were perfect for sharing and everything tasted even better than it looked.    When the sushi platter arrived with a selection of favorites from the chefs, Jonathan took the time to explain what each item was and then left us to dive in.  At this point I have to say that I'm a VERY picky eater and am not usually adventurous when it comes to food. I threw caution to the wind and tried almost everything - including the jackfruit. I can't even remember the names of anything, but suffice to say that I was more than satisfied as were the girls. The portion was just right, even leaving us with a little box of leftovers to take home.  As a vegan, it can be difficult to find a restaurant that appeals to my non-vegan friends... so discovering Sushi Momo was the best birthday present ever!  Now that I've popped my sushi cherry, I will definitely be back and would highly recommend this oasis of deliciousness to vegans & non-vegans alike."}
{"text":"Valentine's day date decided to give Sushi Momo a try. I have to say at first i was a bit skeptical especially since there was no way of seeing the menu anywhere. I am currently on a vegan based diet and wow am i grateful for that journey. Because of it i have discovered the best sushi i have ever had...would i have tried it if i wasn't eating vegan?!  not likely. To top it off i am celiac which further complicates things so my boyfriend took one for the team when we took the gf sharing menu but he didn't feel deprived at all. Everything was awesome, amazingly different and flavorful. Cannot wait to go back, actually i would have gone back today...  A month later i had to get my fix and went back... again it was an amazing experience, will definitely be back again and drag my non vegan friends cause it's just that good!!!"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant.  I'll start by saying that I am very happy that they moved locations because their older one, apparently, was very small and could only accommodate 1/3 of their new location.  I personally am not vegan, but I like supporting businesses so here I am.  We came here on Thursday evening at 5pm for my birthday. We had the Omakase for 2.  We told the waitress that I was allergic so several fruits, so if I'm writing this, it's because I'm still alive!  They gave us edamame and miso soup to start off the night. Shortly after enjoying a nice hot soup with some nice edamame, we had a beet tartare - yes, BEET tartare. It was so good, I wish I had more!   The main course consists of 25 pieces of maki's. I have to tell you guys: if you want to use soy sauce, use a tiny bit because the rolls are good as is!  We finished the night with a nice jasmine ice cream.  I can't believe this was all vegan, it was so good!  The pictures will tell you everything."}
{"text":"The food is so amazing.  One of my favorites in Montreal. The best vegan sushi.  A great selection of items on menu.  The staff is very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Enfin un resto sushi vegan ! J ai adoré mon expérience a Sushi Momo ! J ai hâte d y retourner !  Merci au Chef proprio d avoir eu cette magnifique initiative !"}
{"text":"I had friends coming into town for an indulgent Montreal weekend and wanted to book one night that would be fun and delish but still veggie and healthy. I hadn't been to the new location yet but I'd really enjoyed the original and loved the friendly joyful service and felt like I could trust them to pull off a fun group dinner.   I was not wrong! For $30 each plus drinks we had a crazy epic feast. Started with salads and crispy rolls and fried wonton style dumplings, super flavourful and fun bites. The showstopper though was the massive sushi boat. Why is it on a boat? Why isn't all my food served in a boat?   The group top favourite was the spicy jackfruit roll, and our least favourite were the ones with a pesto inside - the flavour combo freaked us out. There were so many to try from though, and so many left over, you couldn't be mad at having a few you didn't enjoy as much.   Dessert was delicious as well and our bottles of wine were affordable and tasty.   The big group table we were seated at in the back was great for getting a view of the whole spot, and still feeling kind of intimate with the group. It's a bit weirdly shaped though, I imagine the person sitting in the furtherest corner could feel a little left out. Not a big problem in our case as that guy in our group has a megaphone voice.   Everyone I'd invited seemed happy, even though they'd started dubious, and the service was as warm and welcoming as I'd hoped. For vegetarians or pregnant people this place is a gift. We'll be back soon no doubt."}
{"text":"Extremely tasty non-Japanese makis !!!  Don't think you are going to eat Japanese, because you are at the wrong place. Japanese sushis/makis aims for simplicity and the tasting of a almost-single fresh ingredient. Sushi Momo is using makis as a blank canvas to compose surprising associations of many flavors, textures and colors, all fresh and vegan ! Every bite was an experience ! Bravo to the chef !  Nice thing is that they have a set menu to share for 2-4-5 people for 30$/person; you will get to taste a variety of things, they change the menu quite often. Very good food at a very good price. I recommend to everyone : vegan, vegetarian, carnivores, omnivores, etc !"}
{"text":"I was not expecting that Montreal can beat Toronto's sushi experiences. Aaah well, \"vegan/vegetarians\" sushi experience.  But it did! All credit goes to Sushi Momo vegetalien. I went there on a weekday lunch time. To my surprise it was pretty busy. It is a fancy fine dine.  But every penny is worth it.  The sushi's are so innovative, delicious and gorgeously plated! The server said \" They are made with love\"   They have a platter , if you are in a group its worth trying. There are around 25 pieces in the platter with 5-6 varieties of shushi's.  They offer Eddamme as welcome snacks. Equally yummy!  They sushi's are sooo fresh, flavourful and full of beauty ( lol, can't remember any synonym with F). Simply 'F'antastic!"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant! We absolutely loved the food and the service was great! Not only did the waiter help us with the menu, he recommended the special for 2 with great enthusiasm. This came with edamame, miso soup, beet tartare, 25 assorted rolls and ice cream. What a great presentation for ever meal that was brought out! (Even if you aren't vegan, you certainly won't be disappointed! I found that it was a very convenient location, easy parking and short walk. I recommend a making reservation! Very easy, you can do so by going right on their website. We traveled 75 miles to eat here and will most certainly be back as soon as possible. Thank you Sushi Momo for a great meal!!!!"}
{"text":"OH MY GOSH THIS PLACE IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!!  SERVICE Service was absolutely amazing. We went in around 4:30 without a reservation, and they seated us without a question (this place usually needs a reservation because it's so busy). Our waitress was a sweetheart and she made sure that everything was to our tastes and checked in with us periodically. One of the people in my group has a mushroom allergy, and our waitress made sure she was accommodated and gave her alternative dishes  FOOD The food was absolutely delicious. We ordered the saiko ko for four, which included miso soup, two appetizers, 50 pieces of sushi, and dessert for about $30/person. It doesn't sound like that much, but when it all came on the table, it was So Much food (There was even more sushi than the pictures I've attached). We had a beet tartare for one of the appetizers, and it was absolutely delicious. The sushi was also amazing and every different roll had a unique taste that I've never had before.  10/10 would recommend and a restaurant you should definitely try if you are in Montreal!!"}
{"text":"The fact that I'm giving vegan sushi 4-stars says enough right there.   #1 I am a seafood lover #2 Despite fact #1, I don't crave sushi or go out of my way to eat it #3 Just try to keep me away from dairy...  Given all of these facts, dinner at Sushi Momo was quite good. Not too heavy, not too light, plenty of food to go around with a large group. Those boats are ginormous and can accommodate 8-10 people easy.   White wine by the bottle on a warm evening compliments the meal in the best way possible, too! Even if you can't have all the vices, one is still OK.   Would I go back? Actually, yes I would.  Am I now a vegan sushi lover? Not quite, but Momo has changed my tune quite a bit."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Sushi Momo since it opened a few years back. I can say - with 100% confidence - that this is my favourite restaurant in Montréal.   Vegan or not, I cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough; I can almost guarantee that you will not find better sushi anywhere else. I have brought most of my friends here, and have never received a complaint. Everything is made-to-order, and the flavour combinations are amazing. They also have several gluten-free options, which is always a plus for those with allergies.   The restaurant itself is very clean, and the location is great - Saint-Denis and Pins. The service is always good, albeit a bit slow. With that said, the food is so amazing that it makes up for it. It's a bit on the pricey side, but again, the quality of the food makes it worth it. I would also recommend making a reservation online as it's always fairly busy. The fact that Sushi Momo has become so popular over the last few years couldn't make me happier. Whether you're visiting from out of town, or live in Montréal, definitely give this restaurant a chance - you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. Je crois que j'ai trouvé ce que je demanderais comme dernier repas sur Terre. Sushi Momo revisite le sushi comme personne! De la gastronomie végane comme je l'aime  La table d'hôte vaut la peine (Environ 30$ par personne) surtout si vous n'êtes pas familier avec le menu; ça donne un beau survol du menu. Très excitant! Fabuleuses présentations. Le tartare de betteraves est surprenant et délicieux! Message aux omnivores: le poisson ne vous manquera pas!  Leur nouvel emplacement est un peu plus grand qu'avant et à proximité du métro Sherbrooke. Un conseil cependant: réservez! C'est plein à craquer même les soirs de semaine!"}
{"text":"I used to order take out here all the time and it was always excellent. On the night we went there in person it was just as we remembered it when ordering. The waitress unfortunately forgot to enter one of the pieces of the order and by the time we asked about it the kitchen had closed, but she offered us dessert on the house to make up for it."}
{"text":"the BEST sushi in all of montreal! and it's vegan! meat lovers and herbivores will both take delight in the incredibly beautiful flavors and textures of sushi momo! every time i put a roll in my mouth it is mindblowingly amazing!   the new location is very cool and trendy. my only wish is that their menu was the same because it is a bit smaller than it used to be. but the food was excellent as always and the customer service is wonderful!"}
