{"text":"Wow. I can't believe I've never been here before and I've been living in Brampton for over 40 years. 

After being a former regular patron of Giggling Tomatoes (who have raised their prices immensely and shrunken their portions), Sunset Grill with their always moderately high prices, and Flips;I can say for an economically conscious individual with multiple kids; this is a place that I will definitely go back to. 

Sure the decor is a throwback to the old Mother's Restaurant Era. But the service and quality of food were great. (I know... How can you screw up breakfast? Believe me... You can!) 

I never had an empty cup of coffee... It was always full from the moment I sat down before ordering, the waitress asked if I wanted coffee and immediately filled it and to add... Made sure there was always cream on the table. 

I have to still try egg smart in the same complex (I still remember that being a country style way back when) but so far... This place is awesome."}
{"text":"The food is good and the customer service is great for the most part. They always make you feel welcomed. The only problem with this place is that some of the seats are torn up and there isn't much a a backing, but other than that this is a great place."}
{"text":"Food is cooked fresh and everything tasted good. There was a little bit of a wait after being seated to order drinks and place order but it was well worth it, place was busy. I'll be going back again"}
{"text":"It's hard to get breakfast wrong, and they managed this task. 
No wonder eggsmart does well in this plaza."}
{"text":"I am going to give all my stars to the breakfast because it is on point. It is hot, fresh, delicious, and I've never been disappointed with it. 

The staff is... Well inexperienced except for the one who works breakfast on the weekend, she is Polish and she is AWESOME! The rest of the staff is horrible. They forget to give you coffee refills, they come and check on your food about 20 mins after they drop it off. 

If you go during the week except to be there for awhile because they are slooooooow. We waited once for a simple soup and sandwich for almost an hour. It was ridiculous. 

This is mainly a weekend breakfast/lunch joint. Go on the weekends and you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Don't order the Buffalo wings. They were disappointing  and so was the yellowish blue cheese dressing that came with them. Otherwise, everything else we ordered was good and the service was great. My brother (a Tim Horton's drinker) liked the coffee a lot."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to get a solid breakfast? That's how I came to trying this place out by being on the search for a what random places Brampton had to offer for breakfast.

I came to Stacy Lee's Family Restaurant to have a typical breakfast that could fill my appetite. At first glance, the decor and furniture are outdated which gives you a sense that this restaurant has possibly been here for a while. Although its tattered look, it really gives the aura that its essentially a family restaurant.

Right off that bat after sitting at our booth, the waitress came and poured us coffee that we were surprisingly charged for. (Obviously after Hindsight, we should've asked if we were getting charged for it and nothing comes free, but in our defense her approach allowed us to believe they were free). But I digress.

What my girlfriend and I ordered was the \"Hungry Man's Breakfast\" which in surprisingly for us, was actually ALOT of food for what the cost is. This breakfast costed us $10.99 + tax and it came with 3 Eggs, a choice of 4 pieces of ham/bacon/sausage, 3 buttermilk pancakes, potato hashbrowns and 3 slices of toast sliced diagonally. For the price, its a solid breakfast that really gets the job done regarding your appetite.

However speaking individually about the breakfast, you can't really mess up the standard eggs, toast and sausage/ham/bacon. What I really critique is the \"hashbrown\" and their pancake. Starting with the hashbrown, they serve the kind that is like a cubed french fry but they were really good. These hasbrowns where fresh, crunchy on the outside and soft in the inside. 

However the pancakes fell short for me and my girlfriend (who is a pancake connoisseur). They are buttermilk pancakes but are a little too \"bready\" for my taste. Don't confuse this with fluffy pancakes, I say bready in the way that it absorbs the syrup and when you eat the pancake, it seems like it still needs more. Its more of a sponge, but the taste is just like any other pancake.

Overall this place offers a solid breakfast for a very affordable price. I would personally come back just for the amount you get because I know I would be full. Basically more food and cheaper than Denny's LOL"}
{"text":"Yet another entry in the blink-and-you-might-miss-it group of small establishments near downtown B-Town is Stacy Lee's.

I kind of feel bad for this place. Not only does its spot in the plaza seem unlikely to view from the road, it's in alarming close proximity to an Eggsmart location. Gah!

The inside is rather basic. The booths are spacious and comfy, and some great sunlight finds its way in through the windows. A ChumFM-esque station faintly plays in the background. My server was very nice, and while she forgot that I asked for the bill to be brought with my meal to make a quick exit once done, everything else was on point.

The menu has a terrific selection. Everything from breakfast items, to lasagna, to steak, there were quite a few options to weigh before ordering. In a devastatingly unlikely turn of events, I went with their big burger. The wait seemed a little long, but was it worth it?

The thing was delicious! 2 thick patties on an insanely fresh bun, with chili in the middle. Not only were the patties perfectly cooked, but the chili was very good too. The fries it came with weren't all that great. Ok, they were pretty bad, and just seemed store-bought-frozen-hellsticks, and not even the good kind. I wasn't about to let that sour such a great burger though.

The price was standard for what I ordered, and the other menu items were very reasonably priced as well. I'd most definitely return. Might spring for the salad instead of the fries next time."}
{"text":"The review is based of a limited experience, but that experience is also typical for most patrons here. Let me explain:

I've known about this places for ages and it's certainly been here far before several of the breakfast chains opened up all around town. When we were seated, the waitress did not leave us menus. When she returned and we asked for them, she said \"I can bring those for you, it's just that almost everyone coming here at this time orders the $5.99 breakfast special which goes till 11.\"

Sure enough, my wife and I went for it, and it's hard to argue against a meal that is priced the same as the cheapest breakfast combo at McDonald's. As you would guess, it included: 2 eggs your way, choice of meat (bacon, sausage, ham), toast (white, dark, rye) and home fries.

Based on the price, as long as they didn't screw it up, it's already a minimum '3', but my wife and I were pleasantly surprised by the subtle extra quality in the preparation. I had scrambled eggs and they were just perfectly cooked. Still a bit soft and not starting to brown - but not undercooked either. My wife's eggs were textbook medium. Even the bacon was better. Often places cook at lot at once and leave it heated in the corner of the grill. This bacon had to be done fresh as it wasn't dried out and still malleable and warm. Home fries were good too.

I can't comment on anything else. I'll likely be returning too, but probably for the same thing, so I doubt an updated review will happen or that I'll find out what else is on the menu either."}
{"text":"Place has alot of nostalgia for me as a kid from the neighborhood.  It really isn't anything special(coming from someone that loves their brunch spots in Toronto) and the decor is quite dated. The one thing you get at Stacy Lees is value compared to most breakfast joints. Hungry Man breakfast has and will always be my go to."}
{"text":"This restaurant is smaller and has been here for ages. It's like a small home town type of place. We come here for brunch on weekends was a couple and the food is what you'd expect. Hearty portions of breakfast favourites. Nothing stands out but everything is good. The service is kind of the same. Either high school kids at their first jobs or lifers calling you hon and sweetie (which is fine). Nothing stands out but everything is good. Their coffee is decent and refilled often. My only reason for leaving off a star is that this place seriously needs an overhaul out of 1992. The benches are not comfortable , everything is super worn and looks dirty. Not as clean or well kept as other spots in the area. But a solid 4 stars. Go eat!"}
{"text":"This hidden gem is a must visit brunch joint in Brampton. We walked in by accident and was surprisingly satisfied. Service is great and food is affordable and good. We will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Cozy little place I used to go to every single Sunday! Everyone is really nice. Do yourself a favor and try the Ranch Skillet, aaamazing!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite greasy spoon. If you want a solid non-nonsense breakfast this is the place. Walk in, grab a newspaper off the bar, sit anywhere, turn your coffee cup over and order the special: eggs, sausage or bacon, potatoes, toast and coffee. A solid breakfast for under $10 with tax and tip included. Enough said.

If you are looking for gourmet, this is not the place - for that it would get 1 star. This is a no-nonsense, fill your belly, comfort food place - for that it gets 5 stars."}
