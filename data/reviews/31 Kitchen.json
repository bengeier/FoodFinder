Food so so!
Service so so!
Price good but taste just so so!
$6.95 with steam rice, soup, vegetable and dessert!
The restaurant seem old and dirty!
Waiting time for food was too long!"}
{"text":"The best restaurant for your buck; in our opinion. It's good for lunch or quick dinner- nothing fancy, just fast service, well cooked homestyle meal. We ordered combos that come with bubble tea & pudding. For $6.95-7.95 you get: braised intestine, need satay ramen, minced pork & taiwanese sausage meal. Very tasty, very cheap, lots of options, spacious space. Definitely better than Tian Ren and cheaper. Will definitely come back to this hidden gem."}
{"text":"After the 2015 renovation: 
Amazing presentation of food and environment!   Much better than how it looked before, and is much more spacious.  Great job!  Check out the dishes that we ordered!

Menu got switched up a little bit, and it seems like it's for the better."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch and found the food and drinks to be decent.  It's not a bad choice if you're just looking for casual asian food or if you just want dessert and bbt.  They have a good variety of items, both sweet and savoury, so you'll probably find something you like. 

We ordered a durian slush and green apple bbt with tapioca for drinks.  Both were fine but I found that the tapioca lacked sweetness.  Not a huge deal, as they weren't mushy or too hard...that I can't stand. 

We also ordered a ramen and the teppan rice with beef (plus cheese and corn).  Ramen was average but I really liked the teppan rice.  The beef wasn't the best quality but once you mixed everything together with the sauce, it actually tasted really good.  Highly recommend adding corn and cheese :) 

For dessert, we ordered the marshmallow custard toast which was good but if you're not a huge fan of super sweet things then you might not like it so much."}
{"text":"Slow service, ALWAYS mix up or completely forgot about your order. Unfriendly attitude. Lots of people simply hog the table playing cards even finished dining for an hour. The restaurant decides to do nothing but let other customers waiting in line. If you enjoy horrible dessert experience, this IS your place to go."}
{"text":"The deserts here are very average. The ambiance is nice though. Overall, not as good as other chinese desert places like Destiny's or Go For Tea."}
{"text":"Whenever it's late in the evening and I'm out with friends who can't seem to decide whether they're hungry enough for a full meal or just appetizers or just a dessert, 31 Kitchen is one of my go-to places around my area.

From bubble tea, to authentic asian-style desserts and of course, crepes and waffles...this place is a great place to indulge your sweet tooth (or teeth, if you're like me).

Even though the place is mostly full of the young asian demographic, the place is still mellow enough that you can hold a decent conversation with the people you are with without raising your voice. Service is inconsistent in the few times I have been here, but nothing too bad to comment about. It's just hard to get their attention sometimes. I wish they had those \"wall buttons\" that many Korean restaurants have. 

Overall I love going to this place when I can't make up my mind about how hungry I am. Their menu, while extensive, is not too hard to figure out. The prices aren't that bad either.

Last night we ordered 2 mains and a few desserts. For $7 their popcorn chicken Ramen was just perfect for satisfying my hunger + craving for something salty and deep fried (hey, the stomach wants what the stomach wants). I won't compare their ramen to other authentic ramen places I've been to because I know full-well that their specialty isn't ramen. 

For dessert I simply must have my condensed milk toast (I know, I can make this at home) and deep fried milk. My friends ordered more authentic desserts like the stewed milk & papaya and the House Special Super Golden Sago. Thier desserts tasted pretty good as well (none of them too sweet) but I think I'll stick with my fried milk and condensed milk.

If service was more consistent and I didn't have to stand up waving both arms in the air (like I just didn't care), then this place would definitely be a ****1/2."}
{"text":"--- SUMMARY ---

Pros: nice place to hang out; decent food, opens late

Cons: some servers were really smart and some were just slow (the contrast was slightly ridiculous... can't play games... 

--- COMMENTS ---

House Special Super Golden Sago  $7.95
(Sea coconut, mixed fruit, mango ice cream, golden sago mix)
- totally recommend this in general if you can share, or if you're trying to decide between this and the one below it on the menu :) 


Sweet Walnut  and Sesame soup $4.95
- it'd be nicer if it were just the sesame :P  


Stewed whole papaya milk pudding $7.95 (careful, it's HOT; wait for it to cool down) 
- the papaya milk pudding (served in a bowl instead of inside an actual papaya 1/2) is a better deal


smart service w/ some of the servers - w/ some our water / extra napkin requests were fulfilled quickly (bowls were distributed, because some figured that my friend and i would be sharing, with others, not so great - we had to ask the same server 3 times for water (we got water the 4th time we asked.) 

i love the milk pudding here (and it's pretty close to where i live) so i'll be coming back for sure :) hopefully they'll smarten up and allow people to play games inside, soon! :)"}
{"text":"I've come here a couple times but I forgot why I didn't like to come back until afterwards.   The service is bad!. The waitress keeps telling me to wait while they clean tables,  chit chat, etc... everything else comes before your service. I ordered 2 lunches and a dessert.   My hot dessert came at the same time??? Anyways after realizing we didn't even get water/tea, I politely asked and was told if I want tea, it'll be $1!!! Are you kidding me? After spending probably $35-40 for 3 things,  they don't give you tea for free? ??? Which by the way, had no taste and seemed like just hot water.      When we asked for the bill, the waitress just ignored us and just stood there playing with her phone instead. .maybe she didn't hear us.. just maybe... but when we finally walked up to the cashier desk, I told her I was in a hurry,  she didn't even apologize and just gave me the bill in a hasty way. .. thanks for your service. .. we won't come again.."}
{"text":"This is my least favourite restaurant at Leslie plaza, but I keep on coming back. Simply, it is the best place in the area to meet someone, and I've met plenty of someones throughout the last year. 

Bubble tea (or boba), sweets, clay pots, popcorn chicken, indescribable Chinese snacks indigenous to the South of China, and herbal teas that somehow I suspect isn't all that herbal. 
The decor is atrocious, makes absolutely no sense. No theme, but well lit. Trendy ambiance, almost as if it was inspired by some stock photography picture. Not worth mentioning. The menu is not for serious foodies, but some of the sweets such as the pudding is rich and uniquely delicious. 
Complimentary purple (not as good as the white one) pudding is offered to all patrons. The toast is something among their prettiest dishes, and possibly the biggest you'll ever see.  
I would forego the clay pot rice dishes, as most of the rice is stuck onto the clay pot, and the edible portion is quite hard in texture. The popcorn. The popcorn chicken is frozen packaged. Don't ask me how I know.

Very friendly service from the staff. Reasonable prices for 'cute' food. 
As mentioned, I do only come here to meet people. Specifically female people. I spare them of the horrendous sight of my eating Chinese food. Instead, I adopt a sense of civility, which is made easy by the dishes here designed not to be devoured. Cute food is meant to be consumed cutely. 

I see people of my past, present, and perhaps even future. I see them all here each time I visit. This is the only restaurant that I bump into people that I know of, constantly. This is why This place is my least favourite within the plaza. Bubble is the great equalizer, it brings people together...well, at least Asian people."}
{"text":"Great late night food and dessert place. They provide wifi but its not that good. They serve herbal water so its not that its dirty.  They have hot and cold desserts, steamed rice, hot stone pot rice, hot pot rice, herbal stop, ramen, herbal tea, bubble tea, slushies, fried things etc. They have magazines readily available for both genders interest.  The bathrooma are only one stall though. If what you see on the menu iant exactly what you want you can ask them to add or subtract certain thinga. For what it is ita on a bit pricier side but they put the effort into prepping which you wont at home. Great place to sit snd chill long, they wont kick you out. Certain seats have oulets too for chargers or laptops."}
{"text":"food quality is really high.  soup very healthy.   many meals are balanced. comes with veges and brown rice."}
{"text":"My go-to place for Chinese dessert in North York. Located in a busy Asian plaza (good luck parking) this surprisingly spacious restaurant serves an eclectic assortment of chinese food ranging from popcorn chicken on rice, curry fish balls, herbal Chinese health stews, fruit sago soups, Taiwanese shaved ice, etc. Is it the best food I've ever tasted? No. Do they keep their cleaning products in a tiny washroom? Yes. In other words, a slightly above average Chinese hang out, that lets you play board games on the weekdays. When you got no where else to go, this place is a pretty reliable destination. If you can find a parking spot."}
{"text":"Great menu choices but service is very slow and recently they increased their prices by a significant amount."}
{"text":"I'm in this plaza a lot, but been avoiding this place because of the 2.5 star rating. Decided to give it a try after a few recommendations. 

It's actually good stuff. The food was tasty, and also great value (special combo comes with a tea drink and small dessert for under $10) . Portion size is good, although not as big as what you'd get at HK cafes. 

Takes credit cards
Will return."}
{"text":"This restaurant truly takes the cake for being the worst restaurant in Toronto.

i)Tables and cutlery is dirty
ii)Servers pay no attention to you and slam the food on the table.
iii)Dessert is brought before the main dish.


Absolutely disgusting, and the most horrible experience ever.
And for a bubble tea place, the bubble tea is absolutely awful.

Congratulations!
Instead of screaming at me in Mandarin, why not try English?"}
{"text":"Went here at around 9pm for some after-dinner dessert. The place is pretty spacious, and we were seated (5 people) in a big round booth.

We ordered FU02: mix fruit and ice cream chocolate fondue for 13.99. Overall thoughts were it wasn't bad, you can't really go wrong with fondue, the chocolate they used was definitely not fondue chocolate though because it started to clump together after a while. The fruits were fresh, the marshmallows weren't stale and the ice cream was a good accompaniment. 

We also had D02: roasted marshmallow and custard toast for 5.99. They ran out of custard though so we subbed it with condensed milk. The toast tasted fresh and had a nice crunch but personally I found it to be too sweet because marshmallows are basically 90% sugar lol. A very rich dessert overall.

Lastly, we had A16: stewed whole papaya with milk/egg pudding for 8.99 **NOT WORTH**. The papaya they used was so small, it's comparable to the size of a mango. And I know papayas are a bit steeper in price compared to other fruits but considering that the papaya was the size of my hand and the egg pudding inside could be eaten in approximately 5 scoops: it is a dish I regretted ordering.

Overall, this place is aright, like nothing really stood out to me during my first visit here. The menu is pretty big which is a plus. There's free wifi but it's not that good, it disconnects a lot. The service is a bit above average as the staff cleared dishes and we were able to get their attention pretty easily."}
{"text":"***1/2 stars

31 Kitchen is mostly a place to indulge in sweets!  But like most bubble tea joints, it seeks to diversify in to the savory side of things so that they can still attract customers during regular meal times.

The ominous glow of green inside the restaurant reminds me of a poor TVB portrayal of what hell looks like.  The décor is simple, but overall a clean presentation.

This place is like a Demetres, Destiny Tea Cafe & Hung Fook Tong all rolled in to one.  The only thing we missed was the lack of cakes on their menu.

We opted for the House Special Milk Pudding ($4.95) and the Black Sesame Pudding ($4.95).  Of the two, the black sesame definitely had more flavour with coconut milk providing a rich and creamy texture.  The milk pudding had very subtle flavours and was sprinkled with some crumbled wafers.  Both were refreshing.

The Mango Pudding ($4.95) came in its usual heart-shaped molded form (which you will have seen frequently at dim sum restaurants) topped with evaporated milk.  To their credit, this was not just all powdered flavouring + gelatin, but had actual chunks of mango in it.

The Strawberry + Blueberry Crepe with Ice Cream ($8.95) was pretty standard.

The Chinese have many \"old wives tales\" when it comes to beauty secrets.  Cue papaya, which is rumoured to enhance the size of your breasts (though I think I'm way past puberty for that to have any effect) and egg whites which is supposed to make your skin smooth.  With those promises, the Steamed Whole Papaya + Milk Pudding ($7.95) is a staple in most Chinese dessert places with variations including egg white or egg custard in place of milk pudding.  The use of smaller, individual-sized papayas does away with the usual bitterness that is found in larger papayas and the milk pudding is steamed to a nice and creamy custard consistency.  Beauty scams aside, I always enjoy this dish.

V E R D I C T

The service at 31 Kitchen is stellar.  You are served cups of hot Chrysanthemum tea and we got refills frequently.  We didn't have to do a monkey dance to get the attention of the staff.

The food and drinks is pretty standard of your usual bubble tea or dessert shop.  I think I have found my newest spot for my weekly catch-up session with my girl Andrea.  Thank God we don't ever have to go back to Go For Tea or Destiny.  The damage at the end of the day was $11 per person including tax and tip. CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"My friends and i used to go to Destiny's to chill and have bubble tea/ desserts but ever since we found out about 31 Kitchen ... GOOD BYE DESTINY'S. We usually go at night time and the place would be packed, but we never really waited that long for seats. The first time i came here i was surprised that they served red date tea instead of your old fashion green tea. You can pretty much drink that without ordering a drink, plus free refills :D . I remember ordering the iced chrysanthemum rose tea and it was DELICIOUS! Also very pretty. I also got the black sesame pudding and the durian sago in milk they were both very good, but the sago was lacking a bit of durian.  The price range is like your average bubble tea places so that didn't really surprise me. The waitresses and waiters are all very friendly and nice, but English is definitely not their main language so we usually speak in Cantonese when we needed something. They also have a large and really interesting menu where you can get variety of Chinese herbal soups, rices, noodles, snacks, food and desserts."}
{"text":"This place has changed their name a dozen million times, its called Petit potato now (????) And they renovated the interior. I must say that the new design is very well done and love the ambience and plates. However the food is still mediocre. Their desserts are quite good now, especially the Chinese ones. If they work on their food, this place would be perfect."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is sutiable for family, couple, gathering. Not a bad variety of desserts (Chinese and Weestern). Red bean crush ice is pretty good. Disappointed with the mixed fruit ice cream foundue. The fruits are miserable, almost no fruits, yet loaded with marshmallows.
Chocolate fondue is good quality. Overall experience is ok, but am quite disappointed with the mixed fruits ice cream foundue."}
{"text":"Taiwanese minced pork on rice - $5.99. Includes grapefruit bubble tea and milk pudding. The picture of the rice came with lettuce. In actuality, no lettuce. Sad. My bubble tea didn't have bubbles in it. It had a big chunk of grass jelly. I like grass jelly, but this was kinda weird. They also don't use the standard bubble tea cups for the drinks that come with their meals anymore. They use something that looks like a mason jar made into a mug. Downsizing portions? Milk pudding was coconut pudding with chunks of lime jello chilled in. Looked funky. Tasted okay. I'm coming again for the cheap food, but I'm kinda sad that the quality is going down."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, but after sitting down and looking at the menu it was clear it's more of a dessert and fancy drink place. Neither of which is my cup of tea. I ordered an intestine with onion dish, and my wife ordered seafood in a hot pot, which came in a cracked pot. Food was tasty and not expensive. No tea or water was offered, but I guess that's probably because most people would order fancy drinks!?"}
{"text":"I came here for Sunday lunch, and ordered the eel combo. (Eel with rice, soup, pudding, and vegetable side dish) very affordable price at less than $8

(Good) As soon as we sat down, the waiter gave us a warm glass of sweet date tea - very nice touch, as it wasn't your typical glass of tea/water 

(Good) The soup came out first. It was delicious and healthy tasting. Bonus - MSG free! My bowl of soup also had chicken feet in it, which was a pleasant surprise for me, but others may find that to be off-putting.

The eel with rice, vegetable side dish, and pudding came out next all together. 

(Good and bad) eel was deliciously cooked, albeit on the smaller side. This dish also came with fried egg, which was medium so the yolk oozed onto the rice, adding to the flavor. Unfortunately, the rice was extremely dry and hard.


(Bad) vegetable side dish was very haphazardly made - boiled lettuce oyster sauce poured on the side. I was not able to finish this dish.
 
(Good) mini pudding in a shot glass was delicious, as was expected from this dessert restaurant. 

All in all, I got what I paid for - will be sticking to their dessert menu next time!"}
{"text":"I went there with a friend on Monday night. The traffic seems ok for a Monday night. There were decent amount of people there. 

It had been a long time since the last time I went to this place. They changed the interior decoration. All those semi private booths were gone. The style is more open field and modern. I think it is a good change. 

Food wise we ordered the hot plate green pepper intestine with rice, Hong Kong style shark fin soup, popcorn chicken, and the steam papaya with egg as desert. First of all, I have to say the biggest and best change at this place is the service. Servers were super nice! The hot plate green pepper intestine with rice used sweet chilli sauce so it tasted kinda sweet. I liked the taste but my friend did not at all. She hated to have any sweet taste in her food, so she complained to the server that the dish was too sweet when the server came to ask us if everything was ok. The server apologize and take away the dish immediately, and brought a newly cooked hot plate intestine rice which was without the sweet sauce. Other than the intestine rice, shark fin soup and popcorn chicken were totally disappointment. The soup was too salty and the popcorn chicken was very dry, over cooked, and had too much breading. I think the best thing would be the steam papaya with egg. Papaya was soft and sweet, and had a proper taste. The steam papaya took about 15 minutes to make though since they freshly steamed it as you ordered. 

Overall, their dish and snack are so so but desert is worth trying. And they have very nice server and environment. I will recommend to hangout with friends for a drink or desert but not for actual meal."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, but the last time my party was quite upset about the service and food. We ordered the shaved taro ice cream which took so long to come out, we had to ask to check on it. And then came the green bean soup.. It tasted very fishy, probably because it had more seaweed than beans! When we asked the waiter to take it back after having only having one sip, we still got charged for it. Above all the service is slow and the waiters probably don't care about their jobs at all."}
{"text":"If you have a lot of time on your hands and are craving some dessert, this is the right place to go. They have a pretty large selection of teas, smoothies/bubble teas, ice cream dishes, etc.

The main reason that this place doesn't rate higher is the service. The staff are completely irresponsible. If there are options (e.g. bubbles or jelly) they will choose for you instead of asking you. They don't bother to clarify the order so things can end up never coming. If you're in a group, they serve things as they come so one person can end up awkwardly sitting there while everyone else has their food for half an hour or more. I never realized how waiters at other restaurants must plan for this (especially Western-style ones) until it happened to my mom here."}
{"text":"Worst experience at a dessert place ever! Instead of adding tapioca to my drink they added it to my dessert which ended up costing me $25 all together. They made a mistake and didn't own up to it."}
{"text":"This place turned out to be quite a disappointment. I came in on a Saturday night, and it wasn't too packed which was good. Order: 
Taro snowflake- there is literally no difference between this and a slush. It was quite bland.

Chef recommended crepes- crepe was sandy and not smooth at all

Milk pudding- best thing ordered out of the three. Smooth and milky. 

Probably won't be back, I prefer dessert kitchen much better. There's nothing unique about this place ."}
{"text":"This place renovated and reopened this week.  Their ramen is a must try.  Comparable or better than any Japanese ramen in Toronto.  
We also tried their hot plates with beef tongue.  It was really good too.  Nice presentation.  They've revamped their food.  It's much better than before.  Was too full to try their dessert but they look really good."}
{"text":"Just stopped in here for some dessert, I ordered the hot milk pudding and it was exactly what I expected. Nothing to write home about. Will have to go back again to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Terrible service, they were slow and they mixed up our order. The staff were rude and it was impossible to get their attention.  The servers only speak mandarin and will ignore you if can't speak their language.

The food is generic.  The tables and tableware were sticky and the bathroom is just unsanitary."}
{"text":"Located at Finch/Leslie Square plaza, came here several times since this place changed name/owner.  Still an excellent chinese dessert shop, the decor is fantastic especially during christmas season, and the selection of crepes, waffles, japanese noodles, taiwanese food, chinese health soups, bubble tea, is unique and mouth watering.  If you're into young asian girls (and guys), this is the place to hang out.

Where else can you get a chocolate fondue with marshmallows, fruits, and ice cream at 1 am in the morning?

I brought a few special little kids here the other day, their mouths were watering and their faces lit up in delight upon seeing the photos in the menu.  Never seen them so happy before.  

As far as desserts places go, this is one of the best in GTA."}
{"text":"The snacks here are amazing. Must try are the maltose coated wings. Deep fried to perfection with a nice crispy skin. The deep fried milk and rice roll and eel stone pot rice were all done very well. I would not hesitate to order all the above items again. Inside has just been newly renovated and everything looks great."}
{"text":"Very poor desserts.  The sweet walnut soup was made with powder and they didn't even dissolve it properly with lumps everywhere.  The stewed egg dessert was harder than jelly.  Stay away from the traditional chinese desserts at this place."}
{"text":"This restaurant would be much better if it didnt try to be everything. They have a MASSIVE menu. Drinks (bubble teas, hot teas, coffee), Appetizers, Taiwanese snacks, Asian desserts, Ramen, Stone Pot Rice, Main dishes with rice... the problem is when you try to do too much, you can't do anything well. 

I find the menu here is a hit and miss. Some items are good, like the fried fish cakes (deep fried, piping hot, good order size, sitting on a bed of pickled radish and so delicious), and some items are not so good like the bimbimbap (missing egg, seaweed, bean sprouts, kimchi... when asked the waitress why the dish did not have half the items shown in the picture, she said the menu is old and they haven't changed it yet. So for $9, my friend got a really big bowl of rice and some carrots, some beef.. and I'm not sure what else there was.....). 

My order came out pretty decent. I got the satay beef with rice. The plate of beef was huge, and the dish was overflowing with onions. good value for $10. The flavour wasn't immersed in the meat though, and some pieces tasted pretty bland. I also got the soy tofu with ginger for dessert. It was very gingery and hot which made it perfect for winter. The syrup was served on the side so you can choose how sweet you want it to taste. 

Overall, I think this place is good for desserts or snacks and to chat in (the setting and environment is perfect to catch up with friends) but this is NOT the place to eat a good meal. My friend ranted about her meal for the next few hours.. and she also told our other friends, her parents and maybe even some strangers on the road. Like I said, the food is hit or miss. You've been warned."}
{"text":"I think Rainie L. pretty much took the words right out of my mouth.

This place has excellent snacks, excellent drinks, and excellent dessert. If I was basing out of these three alone, this place would've been an easy four stars. Unfortunately, the menu includes dinner options, and seeing how I had dinner here...down to three stars.

Let's start with the bad (dinner). The ramen wasn't even true ramen and was bland. The soup base was dilute. The beef was okay, nothing special. I personally also didn't like how the dessert came with the ramen (I ordered a combo), as by the time I finished my ramen the dessert somewhat melted.

On the other hand, I was very satisfied with the free drink that came with the ramen and dessert, and we also ordered more dessert (the black bean cake) seeing how satisfied we were.

I'll probably come back for snacks or drinks, but not for a full meal."}
{"text":"So so place to have a quick lunch, or chat at 2am. Your typical Chinese restaurant with bubble tea"}
{"text":"This place not bad, been hear a few times, usually when I'm in the area and craving for Chinese lunch and desert - but their specialty is a desert shop. Waitresses are always friendly and the place is well staffed. Would recommend for Amal groups to sit and talk along with desert."}
{"text":"This place was remodeled/rebranded a few years ago from its previous moniker of \"The Sugar\". Back then, as the name would suggest, they marketed themselves more as a Chinese desserts and tea place. Puzzlingly, even though now they've rebranded as an all-out restaurant, their Chinese name hasn't changed. (Da You Ming Tang - a cute pun in Chinese.)

I basically only come here when I'm too lazy to go further, since it's in my neighbourhood. I also only ever get one thing: their combo of a main dish + bubble tea + pudding, which is of great value. Otherwise, it's not really worth it. Their bubble tea is just okay, and most of the food I've had there is meh. 

The interior is nice although a little weird. I thought this Yelper's description was hilarious -- \"The ominous glow of green inside the restaurant reminds me of a poor TVB portrayal of what hell looks like.\" -- since that's exactly what my HK friends thought as well.

Oh yeah, also they're the only place I know that seems to serve what I think is date tea. It might be weird if you haven't had it before, and most of my friends (who are Chinese) don't like it, but I love it.

I haven't had their desserts here, which might be good, based on other reviews. Maybe they should have stuck to being a desserts place."}
{"text":"I am just perplexed by the good reviews of this place. Granted there are only 4 as I am writing this, but still they seemed pretty consistent. 

We have driven by this place a million times and never given it a second glance, but based on the reviews, off we went to give it a try.

First impressions were pretty good. We were seated right away in a large booth. The restaurant was clean and modern looking, although covered in Halloween decorations, despite it being November 10. 

Menu looked pretty good, with lots of selection. The front of the menu is the desserts, which seem to be why most people come here. But we wanted dinner as well. I ordered the shrimp wonton soup and my husband ordered chicken and mushrooms with rice. 

We both ordered drinks. I ordered a tea and my husband ordered a mango smoothie. 

My drink came out...then my soup came out...neither of my husbands orders came. It took another fifteen minutes for his food to come and his drink came after that! No apologies for the wait. 

My soup was pretty basic. The noodles had no taste and a sticky texture. It was bland overall, but not terrible. My drink was good, but small, given the $6 price tag for a tea. 

My husbands dish was just gross. The chicken were little balls that looked like chicken fetuses. Maybe they were?? Filled with bones, making them very difficult to eat. The taste was bland and salty. 

His drink was good, but the straw didn't reach to the bottom of the glass...which wasn't a glass at all, but a wine decanter. He couldn't reach his drink about half-way through and had to borrow my straw.

We finished our meals and started waiting...and waiting and waiting. No one had come to check and see how our meals were and we had to flag someone down to clear the dishes. A girl finally came to go it and did so without looking, or asking if there was anything else she could get for us, or if we wanted refills. 

We REALLY wanted to give this place the benefit of the doubt, so we decided to stick it out and order dessert, since it seemed to be what this place was all about. 

We flagged someone down and ordered mixed fruit on a waffle. The presentation of the dish was certainly nice, but it's pretty generic. It's a basic belgian waffle with vanilla ice cream, strawberries, bananas and some melon balls and cool whip whipped cream on top and a sort of Aunt Jemima syrup. 

It was pretty good, but nothing special.

Once we finished we flagged someone down to get our bill. He said yes and left...and never came back. We saw his give other people bills and get food...he basically completely forgot about us. We waited for 15 minutes. We started looking around to figure out what happened and noticed that the wait staff were just chilling in the back of the restaurant. One girl was staring aimlessly at the ceiling. Two others were holding hands and swinging their arms in time to the music. Two guys were back there chatting away...it was actually weird. 

Finally, we managed to flag down yet a DIFFERENT waitress...this was number 6 (one seated us, one took our order, one cleared the dishes, one took the dessert order and one went to get our bill...apparently, and now this one) and asked her to get our bill. She finally did. We paid...we left a tip (we try hard not be be jerks, even if the service is poor) and left...never to return. 

So yeah, bland food, generic desserts and TERRIBLE service = not worth it. 

One another note, another review says, \"If you're into young asian girls (and guys), this is the place to hang out.\" I KNOW this person meant nothing by this comment, but I swear there is some creepy dude who has done a Google search of \"Places where young Asian girls and boys hang out\" and found this place based on that review...so you know...probably some creepers hanging around as well. Just sayin'! (*Note: This comment, as creepy as it was, had no baring on my review)."}
{"text":"Quite enjoyed my dinner here. It wasn't omg it's so amazingly good. But many positives from this experience. Service was quick and efficient. Our waiter was very nice. 

I ordered the Minced pork on rice in taiwanese style. It was a special combo which came with a grapefruit green tea & milk pudding (mango). The total before tax was $ 5.97 !!! So cheap! When I first ordered it, I thought the portion would be small but it was actually a decent size. Taste was good as well. 

Would definitely come back again. The only con would be the parking at this plaza. Always hated it."}
{"text":"I can only comment on the desserts here as we came after dinner. We were seated promptly, given the menus and a sheet of paper to write our orders down. Getting the servers attention afterwards was difficult. The desserts weren't bad; they serve a wide variety of Asian desserts. What we ordered was basically grass jelly, sago and fruits in milk - can't go wrong with that. Nothing amazing but not bad either. The fruit was fresh and it was a decent portion. This seems like a good place to chill for a late night snack. There's free wifi as well."}
{"text":"Lunch Special from $7.99 includes a choice of drink. There are quite a few items to choose from and I did not have much expectation but was pleasantly surprised.

Beef Bowl in Japanese Style + Cold Honey Green Tea ($7.99) 
I love the Green Tea with just a touch of sweetness. The rice bowl is decent portion but may not be authentic Japanese food but will do. The pickled ginger was a nice touch and made the dish so much better.

Service was friendly and efficient. They really did a good job renovating the interior. Now it feel so much more spacious and of course the electric outlets at each of the booth seating area is definitely a welcoming upgrade.

I would come back for more lunch special for sure! And maybe some Chinese dessert too!"}
{"text":"We dined here early Sunday evening.  We ordered a Popcorn Chicken Ramen ($9.95), a Pork and Mui Choi with Steamed Rice ($8.99), and a Sweet Sesame Dumplings dessert ($4.99)

Popcorn Chicken Ramen - The popcorn chicken was served on the side to maintain the crunchy texture.  This was a fine touch.  The ramen had good texture and tasted fresh.  The portions of chicken and ramen were both generous.  The broth was milky, creamy, garnished with seaweed and corn niblets, and slightly but not overwhelmingly salty.  Overall, this dish tasted good.  I was quite happy with it.  4 stars.

Pork and Mui Choi with Steamed Rice - Mom ordered this, and she gave it a thumb-down.  She complained that the dish tasted blander than most.  I tasted the mui choi (preserved vegetable).  It was totally bland.  Mom said she could make this better at home. This dish photographed well, and the portion was good, yet the taste failed. 1 star (ouch per mom).

Sweet Sesame Dumplings dessert - 31 Kitchen redeemed itself with this dessert.  The dumplings were big.  There was a lot of black sesame, and the skin was sweet and chewy.  The sweet soup was loaded with ginger, which I liked.  5 stars.

The interior decor and ambiance was outstanding.  The services was average.  

Overall 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrendous service. All day specials only last till 9. The workers are worthless. They stand around talking to each other and do nothing. I have waited for my food for over one hour.  And I am only with a party of 2 with not even a packed house.   I count 7 workers. I told one to check if the food is coming 45 mins after. She goes straight to playing with her hair and talking to her friends. 

Really unacceptable. The big problem is. This is not an isolated incident.  The service has been constantly bad not to mention their popcorn chicken is green.  I'm serious.   

To add this to horrible ordeal. I ordered rice and they gave me ramen. And to comment on taste. It's not good. Simple

.5 stars for having cushioned back rests. That's it."}
{"text":"Terrible food, mediocre service. None of my friends were happy with their food. Don't come here!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's a bad timing, though considering that the place was relatively empty for a Saturday at 12 (there were still empty seats around us) and they had two staff members, the service wasn't up to par the general quality of the their non-desserts were pretty bad.

As for the service, it seemed very unresponsive and uncoordinated rather than being maliciously lousy like some other restaurants.   It felt like these people were are the first day of the job and have no training.  Granted it is a relatively small restaurant and you can see how things go from the waiter area.

As usual they served us with date tea, back when this was called the Sugar this was one of the reasons I came here because it was a bit soothing, the only problem with it was the version they have now is so diluted you can barely taste it.

For the meals I got ramen with popcorn chicken and my wife got wonton noodle soup.  We both ended up getting the same noodles which were no better than the ones you get at Ajisen with bean sprout filler (yuck) and the same soup base.

I didn't get to try her wontons (normally I don't like them anyway unless it's from Chung King) but their popcorn chicken was okay for me when I ate it first since it wasn't salty, though it is very tough and as I was eating it got even tougher.

The saving grace was the soup base wasn't too bad, I drank it down all the way and didn't get the MSG feel I normally get when I eat at Pho.  However, because the noodles were not the same quality as you would get from Niwatei and they used the Taiwanese tea egg, I  would call this ramen experiment a failure.

My dad and aunt got some rice dishes.  Although they appear nice on the picture, they were pretty much loaded up with rice and not much of the meat.  So it felt more like a rip off.

The only reason I bumped this up to two stars is because of their dessert.  I still like this place for the night time desserts   I had the strawberry and ice cream crepe.  It was a good finisher and the ice cream wasn't too heavy for me.

I would still come here again, but only for the desserts and maybe small dishes.  However, I do know they have the capability of being better depending on the time of day because I was here for dinner once and I liked it too."}
