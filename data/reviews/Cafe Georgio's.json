{"text":"A wonderful find.  You'd never just happen across this place since it's tucked back on a side street, but it's definately worth going to.  The service is wonderful.  It used to be a little two story house and was converted into a nice little Italian place."}

{"text":"Intimate dining experience in a converted house near South Hills Village. Imaginative chef with many medley special (like three types of fish with three different sauces) make every meal there different.    Prices tend to be be between $20 and $30 with some pastas less and a few entrees more. Nice place to get out with your spouse.  One of the owners is also a painter and her works, which are for sale, decorate the walls."}
