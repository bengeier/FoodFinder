{"text":"This place is very creative and has really fresh and delicious ingredients. Elton, was an awesome member of the team and gave me several samples so that I could accurately decide what would best fit my taste. He had a lot of information on where the meat came from and was just in a good mood and very welcoming. The restaurant was clean, smelled delicious, and the bathrooms were also clean. I look forward to coming back and enjoying many other things off the menu. And if Elton is your wrap maker, you are a lucky person!"}

{"text":"This place is great in every way. My wife and I went on a whim one night around 9:30PM. The owners were genuine and welcoming, giving us a short overview of what they do, while loading us up with samples! Their food is hearty, healthy, and homemade while remaining true to their Mediterranean roots. I urge anyone to give these kind-hearted people their business in return for some delicious food. Specifically the meatballs!"}

{"text":"This place is my favorite place to get a wrap from all the food is so fresh and it's not cooked in grease so you will never get that greasy taste!

I would recommend this place for any and everybody especially for an after workout meal. They have Vegan options as well!! Love this place"}
