{"text":"This is pizza in that it is bread with tomato and cheese on it. 
I stopped for a slice as I was starving and in the area. I would have been better starving.  Pizza tasted 3 days old. And beyond that it's one of those places where the employees act like the customers are disturbing them from more important work. Better off getting a pizza from metro"}
{"text":"I usually only order fish & chips from a Fish & Chip restaurant. They specialize in that and that's all they serve so it has to be good.
Other restaurants having been served the crap from the frozen food section of the supermarket a few times makes you leery and lose your appetite. 
All the local fish & chip joints close early and not open on Sunday. So what to do?
I received their pizza menu in the mail with a $2 off coupon so I tried it and was pleasantly surprised. Wild North Atlantic Cod with chips $12.99 reg price.
It was made fresh, good batter and tasty fries and they put it in a small pizza box. Different but better than a styrofoam container. This restaurant is on the ground floor of a new condo tower, clean and very small. There are a few bar stools at the counter if you want to eat it there buts it's mainly takeout. No street parking. Across the road from Humber Bay Park"}
{"text":"More so than adding a new business to Yelp, I do enjoy visiting an establishment that doesn't yet have a listing here, especially when it's a Mom & Pop operation such as this. That's simply because once in a while I stumble upon a gem like this and I get to write an unbiased review! (Although it can be risky and I've come across my share of 0 star joints without having all of you Yelpers' warnings in advance).

As I stated in a recent review of Pizzaiolo, I believe there are two types of pizzas and this place clearly falls into the \"fast-food, inauthentic\" category. But like I also said, sometimes that's exactly what I want!

After moving a few years ago, I'm out the range for delivery from my previous favourite and I'm happy to have found my new fill-in that will deliver to my home. Although this place's \"combo specials\" are not even close to as unbelievably inexpensive as the other, they offer some pretty good deals, in my case, 1 \"large\" pizza, 3 toppings, potato wedges, 1lb of wings and 2 pops which came to $34 all-in.

And the food was great! The pizza had plenty of flavourful cheese and crispy, delicious pepperoni. The wedges were surprisingly crispy and flavourful even after delivery and the wings were decent.

One slight complaint that I found I have here (amongst other cheap pizza places) is that their \"large\" was much closer to what I think should be called a medium.

Oh Cici's Pizza in Parkdale, you haven't lost me for good, it's just that I now have a replacement for you. :)"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE. I wish there was 0 stars for me to give this pizza joint. My fiance and I are always happy to try new restaurants, especially mom and pop shops like this one. When i called to place our order, a chinese lady picked up the phone and asked us what we wanted. Throughout the conversation she was cutting in and out. We ordered their special of medium 3 topping pizza and 1 lb wings. We also ordered a size panzo to try. Pricing wise it is cheap.. for 20.99 you get a medium 3 topping pizza and 1 lb of wings. We had asked if we could do two sauces on the side for the wings and if there was extra charge to it. The lady said no, and so we agreed for hot and honey garlic. Pizza took 25 minutes to make which was standard usually but by the time we got there to pick up our pizza was cold..... As you enter the shop, you see two different pizzas in a case, I'm assuming that is by slice? but it looked old and looked like no one touched it all day...

we get home, which is about a 5 minute drive and we opened up our pizza... first thing i notice was the crust and pizza dough... it is NOT hand made dough.. it looks like those premade crust (basically bread) and they just smothered some tomato sauce on top with very little cheese and toppings... first bite in i immediately thought i was eating card board! Horrible horrible horrible. The wings were overly oily and soggy.. and the worst part is they gave us the wrong sauce! Panzo was the only slight saving grace.... dough was thick and topping was minimal... i counted only 8 pepperoni in the whole panzo. horrible horrible horrible. Will definitely not be returning at all."}
{"text":"This is the most underrated pizza place in an area that desperately needs more access to food. 

It's simple. It's pizza. I would never order anything else here, though they do offer quite a variety. The walk-in pepperoni special is something like $5.99, we throw together a little garlic dip at home and are completely satisfied."}
{"text":"Love this mom and pop place. Now, don't blink when you pass it or you'll miss it. It has no parking on site nor on the streets it is adjacent to. I have to park a block away and walk over. It's not bad and I find the \"trouble\" worth it. It's not a sit down restaurant, but a take out place with five bar seats.
I came be because my nephew was craving pizza I'm sick and tire of Pizza Pizza, and I'm close by. I'm so glad someone wrote about this place.
My nephew went for the pizza combo. It has plenty and pepperoni on it and is not drowning in cheese. The thin crust was cooked perfectly.
I went for their fish and chips (yes at a pizza place). The chips were tasty like the ones you get at Costco, the fish was HUGH and taste good.
If I'm in the neighbourhood and want pizza, I know EXACTLY where to go."}
