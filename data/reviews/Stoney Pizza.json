{"text":"We went to this place late at night while searching for dinner......we got a smiling welcome and a promise to get a pizza in 10 min. The pizza was amazing and put all the other regular branded pizza chains to shame!!  The veggies were fresh, the cheese was just right - all perfectly cooked!  Would love to go back there again!"}
{"text":"Holy cow! Amazing wings! Who would have thought a small pizza shop would have high quality wings! They've added their Asian flair to the sauce. Must try!"}
{"text":"Was underwhelmed the last time I ordered from there. The big thing was the pizza dough. It was one of those store bought pre made discs with the aeration holes through it. Not a good base to start with. Despite that though, the bone-in ham on their Hawaiian pizza makes up all 3 stars. Just delicious."}
