{"text":"STAPLE in my dessert. what a way to end a dinner.
The bread pudding was excellent until I bite in something hard, which was a staple!

I can't believe the waiter told me it was an accident and that it was a bad luck thing.
WHAT?   There were no excuse or whatsoever.
He didn't even offer to have my dessert waived or anything.
I had to ask him on receiving the check.
So, on a 49$ menu, he took off a HUGE 4$ after taxes..
He might as well keep it. ......

I almost swallowed the f* staple !


So Food were ok. Degustation menu at 49$ is subpar for most of the dishes. 

The dessert were good, the entrees were less.
positive thing: Piglet were cooked perfectly. but at 49$ for one dish with extremely small portions is not worth it.

Magret de canard is not cooked very well. It's supposed to be rosé, but was served medium rare ..when i told the waiter that it was raw, he told me it was the way it's recommended. NO. it's rosé (or pink)


\" Duck meat is at its best when served pink \"

It focuses on Quebec's food, we can identify quality products but it was poorly executed : magret de canard was undercooked, making it chewy.
Veal was undercooked as demanded.

Service is just as bad.

Pricey for what it is.

Not returning that's for sure.

Oh by the way. THANKS SACH (waiter).


Please, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Excellent food but very slow service. Waited for 20 min between each course. The carte blanche was great but the chef menu is sufficient to be satisfied."}
{"text":"One of the worst meals I have had the displeasure of eating in a very long time.

Service was horrible: slow, and the waiter was patronizing. The only option of 6, 8, or 10 courses is a bit ridiculous, especially since it took 3 hours to finish the meal. The foie GRAS was indeed delicious, and the other entrees were good as well. The main meals were awful. 

My friend had the fish main, which was cut in two pieces: one piece was totally over cooked and the other was essentially raw. The pieces were separated by undercooked risotto that tasted like dirt. We sent it back and they brought her some scallops, which were nice but served with more horrible risotto, that was only slightly better cooked.

My main was a lamb in a puff pasty that had a strange flavor and a very mushy texture. It was served next to a huge pile of some slop looking purree with a weird color. It tasted alright, but was very unappetizing to look at.

The \"meal\" capped off with the worst creme brûlée I've ever had. Top was charred and tasted burnt, creme was chunky, and the worst part: it was quite spicy with red pepper flakes. Blech.

There are too many amazing French bistros in Montreal to ever waste a meal at Le Bleu Raisin. Avoid."}
{"text":"Menu 6 dégustations, très bon, très fin, serveur très courtois, une belle expérience.
6 course dinner, really nice, the waiter was really nice and helpfull, great experience!"}
{"text":"Ate with Marc D. and he nailed it. My previous experience was just as good. 

My parents had just flown into town so it made 3 of us.  I was starving but my parents weren't so the restaurant allowed is to get just 2 orders of the tasting menu...bizarre, I know.  The menu consists of amuse bouche, choice of entree, main and dessert. 

They brought out what must have been 6 courses - spanning almost every dish on the menu - over 3 plates each! Very unexpected! Then they \"offered\" us a glass of dessert wine  from Quebec gratis since they can't sell alcohol. 

It was a quiet weeknight granted but they went above and beyond. My parents and I felt truly cared for. 

It's my new standby bistro."}
{"text":"The Bleu Raisin:

I visited the Restaurant on a Thursday night and called on the day of to make reservations. They were happy to have us and as soon as we arrived the host welcomed us with open arms.  We enjoyed the 8 course meal for 65 bucks and it was worth every penny! I highly encourage visiting for dinner during the week!  

A. Bring your own wine is a great perk of the restaurant that allows you to leave drunk and full
B. the lobster and smoked salmon were my two favorite dishes and they are part of the blind menu
C.  The desert really tops off the meals and you feel like they served way more that one can eat

I would encourage coming early since this meal will take you three hours or more to complete. Avoid stuffing yourself on the bread which they bring generously so that you have room in your stomach for all of the tasting menu.  Lastly my only suggestion to the restaurant is bring out the first four dishes faster to avoid getting stuffed by the bread."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants I've eaten in - I loved the food, the atmosphere and the service. I only wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"Went to Bleu Raisin on Oct 24. Food was GREAT. Service wasn't that good. We got there with a reservation. The restaurant was so crowded we felt we were seated on other guest's laps. The 2 other girls at service were great, but the guy waiter was very rude. At the end of the evening we tipped accordingly. Not cheaply, but accordingly. That waiter screamed at me for doing so. I would never go to that restaurant again. We had great food, but an overall bad experience. That's too bad for all other waiting staff and the chefs. You should fire this guy."}
{"text":"Une expérience gustative dans un des restos les plus chouettes du Plateau ! Une cuisine créative, dont le menu \" découverte à l'aveugle \", préparé par le sympathique chef lyonnais Frédérique. Et que dire du service d'une convivialité remarquable? À découvrir et à redécouvrir ! À essayer au moins une fois dans sa vie : la ballotine de pâté de foie préparé maison ! À se rouler par terre. Vite, on y retourne... avec notre bouteille de vin !"}
{"text":"J'avais entendu beaucoup de bien de ce restaurant c'est donc le cur léger et la fleur au fusil que nous y sommes allés. Et effectivement, je dois dire que la nourriture était très bonne. Sauf que voilà, le service lui, était incroyablement lent ! A deux reprises nous sommes venus manger ici (ben oui, on leur laisse une chance quand même...), à chaque fois c'était une fin de semaine, et à chaque fois on a mis plus de trois heures pour être servis (arrivée vers 19h, départ vers pas loin de 23h !). Alors peut-être qu'il y a un rapport de cause à effet, peut-être que la semaine le service est plus rapide et peut-être aussi qu'ils sont tout simplement victimes de leur succès. Mais parmi cette foule de peut-être, il y  a au moins une chose dont je suis sûre, c'est que vu le service, la note est franchement exagérée !"}
{"text":"Bleu raisin is a small restaurant with a warm welcome and homey feeling to it.
I had a nice time there. I was expecting simpler food but was pleasantly surprised in fact. The dishes were all so complex. And by complex I mean there was all kind of separate thing that could've made a dish by themselves. 
The first dish was a smoked salmon piece with aragula salad...a small octopos salad with celeriac in curry remoulade dressing.... And also another one with a piece of dorade and apples.
3 dish in one. All good and different though
Main dish was a beef tartare with potatoes,... boudin noir with grilled vegetables... and a crispy eggplant en croute.
Again three dish in one. I felt like these didn't fit together quite as the entrée.
Dessert was not as good as the rest. Quite odd to my taste. The poached pear with herbs and blue cheese was a weird mix and there was a mushy apple crumble which was quite ordinary. Anything mushy can't be phenomenal.
Overall, I went out pleasantly surprised. I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"I was here with a group but I had eaten before coming so I only ordered an app and sampled bites of what my friends had invested in. My little mushroom pot was delicious, and since that was all I'd ordered they were nice enough to give me a larger portion than the usual which is why I went with three stars. The service really killed this experience though. When I arrived my friends had been at the table with their bottles of wine for 10 minutes and we waited another 10 before I went over to the waitress and asked for a bottle opener and some water. We were the only people in the restaurant and service continued like this throughout the night. Really exceptionally bad. Desserts were exceptionally good but... you know... a gal cannot live on lavender crème brûlée alone."}
{"text":"Je suis allée deux fois à ce restau et les deux fois ont été complètemebt différentes. C'est pourquoi j'ai mis un 3! 

Premiere experience: nous etions avec le pere de mon copain qui connait le cuisiner! Il nous a fait un menu spécial, de malade, avec 6 services tous aussi délicieux les uns que les autres! Le chef nous servait personnellement et vraiment, tout était parfait de la langue de porc en entrée jusqu'au foie gras en dessert! Nous en avons eu pour notre argent ; les prix sont quand même élevés, mais ça va avec la qualité du repas. 

Deuxième expérience: J'avais décidé d'offrir à mon copain une cours de dégustation de vin \"accords et mets\" et c'était dans ce restaurant. La table d'hôte avait été préparée en fonction des vins à découvrir. Les plats étaient bons, mais sans plus. Il manquait la magie et l'effort, le dévouement, de la première fois. Mon repas principal, du lapin, était vraiment très ordinaire et le prix m'est apparu beaucoup trop élevé pour la qualité servie. 

En gros, c'est un coup de chance visiter ce restau! On ne sait pas sur quelle journée nous allons tomber et c'est exactement là le problème! Pour être A one, un restau doit toujours être conséquent et servir la même qualité à chaque jour !"}
{"text":"* Fabulous BYO bistro *

FTR?  Really!??!?!?!?! 

This is a truly fabulous find.   This slightly off the beaten path BYO bistro made for a lovely dinner.  The service was amazingly friendly, professional, and helpful in navigating the menu.  

I had the degustation menu, which was priced at a very reasonable $49.  

Started off with some small bites which included a shredded duck on toast point (the duck was incredibly juicy and blended back in with a bit of duck fat to round out the flavour, to add some texture contrast it was topped with a small pickled gherkin - delicious!), and a shot glass of gazpacho (a good rendition).  

Then had a foie terrine which was accompanied with an intriguing sangria sorbet.  The terrine was flavourful, and the sorbet was an unexpected yet perfect foil.  

The duck leg followed.  They had PERFECTLY crisped the skin and had amazingly tender meat inside.  It was served with a beautiful selection of local fresh mushrooms which were tossed with new potatoes, string beans, and purple carrots.  The veggies were served slightly chilled and in an odd way reminded me of a very good and complex salad.  

I got to taste the deer filet as well, which was cooked to the perfect rare doneness and came with a chocolate sauce which nicely complemented the gaminess of the meat.  

My dessert was a chocolate espresso cake with a plum sorbet and plum coulis.  Once again a surprising pairing which worked very well.  

The atmosphere is typical bistro, where you feel as if you are in Europe.  The menus are on the chalkboard, the service is friendly, the customers are lively, and the food is solid.  

The BYO aspect lets you pick up a bottle at the local wine shop before, which while it can be a hassle does offer a bit more choice than a typical restaurant.  

Overall a great little spot!"}
{"text":"I came here with my family and I have to say it was the most delicious French food I have had in my four years in this city, including at l'Express. The waitress was adorable and assisted us Anglos with our orders, and helped us satisfy even my little sister's picky appetite. The foie gras was to die for and the venison with a type of chocolate sauce, which she said had been cooking for three days, was also delectable. The atmosphere is cute and bistro-like, and it was a pleasant place to eat. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"J'y suis allée avec des attentes assez basses pour le service ayant les les avis qui sont parrus avant le mien mais je m'attendais à une bonne bouffe. Pour ce qui est de la nourriture, c'était excellent et je dois dire que les étoiles sont pas mal juste pour ça. C'est dispendieux mais quand le tier des services contiennent du fois gras, il faut s'en attendre. Au moins, on épargne sur le vin parce que c'est un apportez votre vin. Toutefois, le service était vraiment pas à la hauteur des plats servis. Après un gros 20 minutes d'attente, il a fallu qu'on aille chercher la serveuse pour qu'elle nous donne de l'eau et un ouvre-bouteille pour les vins qu'on a emmené. À la fin du repas aussi, pour commander nos desserts puis pour demander la facture une fois les desserts terminés et les assiettes ramassées (on ne nous a pas demandé si on voulait thé ou café non plus) il a aussi fallu que quelqu'un de notre groupe ai chercher la serveuse. Et tout ça pour notre groupe de 6 personnes qui était le seul dans tout le resto pour toute la soirée! Puis, à la sortie, j'étais la dernière à payer et la serveuse m'a dit que le monsieur avant moi (un ami) n'avait pas donné de pourboire. Elle a ajoutée que c'était illégal de ne pas donner de pourboire car c'est son salaire et qu'on devait absolument donner un minimum de 15%. Soit elle ne connait pas le fait que le pourboire est pour un bon service ET à la discrétion du client, ou bien elle se fait avoir par son employeur....ou les deux. Dommage parce que la bouffe était vraiment bonne..."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 5 other foodies the other night. I was the token pescatarian in the group, so my entrée choices needed to be switched up a bit as I don't do foie gras: I was given a prawn and a goat cheese salad option which was nice. The soup option came in a large shooter glass and although it was tasty, I did not like the presentation as the soup was lumpy and the textures were definitely not shot-worthy.

My fish main was blue marlin and although it was ok, it was certainly nothing outstanding. The sauce was kind of strange/bland but at least the cous cous was done right. I tried the other fish option that my friend had and it was better than mine for sure.

Desserts, we tried them all and that was definitely the best part of the meal: the chocolate cake was perfect, not too sweet. The cheesecake was yummy and the bread pudding was outstanding.

So why 2 stars do you say? The service, or lack thereof. We were the only 6 people in the restaurant for the entire 2 hours that we were there. After we were seated, we waited a good 15 minutes before the server came over with a corkscrew in order to open my bottle of red wine. Courses were painfully slow coming out and when we wanted the bill as we had other places to be, the server again took her sweet time.  She was surly, not especially helpful and gave certain members of our group some serious attitude for the amount of their tip (she really didn't even deserve one, so I have to side with my friend on this one.)"}
{"text":"We enjoyed an excellent meal in this cozy Quebecois restaurant. The service was friendly, informative, attentive, but not rushed (and very patient with translation). 
We tried two entrees (appetizers) - a seafood, salmon and corn salsa salad, and a pot of mushrooms and escargot in a rich cheddar sauce - one plat (US entree) - a croustillant (filo pastry) of duck, vegetables and potatoes in another luscious sauce - and a desert sampler of flourless chocolate  cake with pomegranate and Crème brûlée. Everything was delicious. 
We ordered a la carte, but the 4 course prix fixe looks like a great deal at $49cdn.  The family prides themselves on using all local ingredients. Go here to get a bit off the tourist track and have a good local neighborhood Quebecois restaurant experience. BYOB."}
