{"text":"The food is really well done, fresh and very nicely seasoned.  Small place and well worth the low prices."}
{"text":"I was happy to find that this place was right around the corner from my house. The food hear is very delicious and fair priced too. I'm from LA and the food from this place reminds me of home."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch on a Tuesday and the place was empty. But I was delightfully surprised by this place. I got the taco combo which came with 3 tacos of any meat of your choice, plus beans and rice. I got the carne asada tacos with cilantro and onions and the salsa and they were great! I love tacos and I especially love trying out new places for tacos and their tacos were delicious! The lady working there was really nice as well and the service was awesome. I'd definitely come back here again and maybe try their other stuff."}
{"text":"Over priced and small portions. Clean and friendly but unfortunately I wouldn't recommend"}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite Mexican food joints, I always get the carne asada burrito. Better than Roberto's in my opinion."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great tacos and tostado's for a great price. Everything is super clean inside! And the presentation of food is A+++. Everything is made fresh after you order it and you can tell everything is prepared with special care. I plan to stop by here on a regular basis. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"This is a new little spot that is off the grid. I am always rooting for the little guys so I was happy to see that this little spot opened up. 
Here we go.....
Stopped in real quick to grab a menu. It is a very small menu. Not just small meaning not a lot of choices, small in like it is physically small. No explanations on how the choices are prepared. Example: Burrito. That's it. Hurrache, never had one, just thought it was a shoe. I had to look it up online to see what it was. I like to know what I'm ordering. I went to the website ( happy to see they have one) and still no descriptions.
Decided to give it a try because I really want them to strive. People put a lot of hard work into opening a business. Word of mouth is the best way to get business.
Pros: 
They deliver! I always wondered why Mexican food places don't deliver. This is a plus.
The place is a cute little spot. 
It's clean with lots of seating.
Plenty of easy parking.
The people working were nice.
Prices are comparable.
The food has a nice presentation.
I don't want to dwell on the taste of the food cuz' it is just my opinion of preference.
My main gripe is the hot sauce (salsa). The red sauce tastes like it is a ketchup base. The green sauce had a back taste that threw me off.
The food itself wasn't bad, just needed a little more flavor that good hot sauce could help.
We ordered a flour tostada. It ended up being taco salad-like (not a complaint). More lettuce would have been great. Got it with shredded chicken. It was good. The chicken had a different kind of flavor. The beans were good.
Breakfast burrito. When I ordered it they didn't seem too sure of what came in it so they asked me what I wanted in it. Egg, cheese, potato and bacon. What bacon?? Scrambled eggs. French fries aka potatoes? Ok, I can deal with that. Seemed more like an egg and potato burrito with a pinch of bacon. Again good tasting salsa would've helped.
3 taco combo plate comes with 3 tacos(choice of meat) rice, beans and a drink (canned soda). Chose fried pork. No complaint. Decent. Good salsa would have been a good topper.
Carne Asada wet burrito. I didn't taste it, but was told that it was not something he would try again. He said it was bland. No real flavor.
Not sure if I will ever go back again. I was really hoping to like this place. I'll have to stick to my old faithful when wanting Mexican food ( which is a lot).
Again, just my opinion.
Try it. It might be a place you've been looking for.
Free delivery within 2 miles - major Pro."}
{"text":"This place is in a small strip mall but don't let that stop you from coming in and checking it out.  The food is really good and the prices are reasonable. I had a chicken chimichanga and the super nachos. The place was quiet and clean. The guy behind the counter was friendly and helpful.  Wish I found this place sooner,  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I really like the food here much better than the last restaurant that used to be there. 

At ur first glance you may think the prices are high and let me tell you i don't go buying high priced food anywhere an i can say this place is not expensive at all it is very much worth the money the food is absolutely delicious and you get a pretty big portion. 

Everybody should defiantly try this place out. Its very yummy and you wont regret it."}
{"text":"Very good street tacos and sauce. Chimichanga 4 out of 5 stars. 

Churro 5 stars. 

Clean place. Very friendly."}
{"text":"Yummy!!  I would definitely recommend this place.  One of those places where the pictures actual look like what you get.  So glad we tried them, will absolutely be eating there again, and again , and again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best places to get tacos. I'm really glad the new owners took over and delivered such high quality tacos, from the meat to the salsa -- it's all to perfection. This place is without a doubt going to become a \"must have\" destination in LV for Mexican tacos and I was here before all of you!"}
{"text":"Best mexican food Ive ever had in Las Vegas. I ordered the carne asade taco combo that came with beans, rice, gauc, three tacos and a regular sized drink. The carne asada was tender and well seasoned unlike the carne asada cooked at Roberto's or Don Tortaco. The guacamole was *fresh and the beans had great flavor. My fiance ordered carne asada fries which were amazing because they didnt taste like traditional Vegas carne asada fries. The fries didnt come with beans or guacamole. They came with cilantro and two different kinds of cheese, it reminded me of a Philly cheese stake but on fries. We were pleasantly surprised and plan to return here as soon as possible. 

pros: 
*free refills 
*food is cooked on spot and takes about 10 to 15 minutes to get your food. 
*Great customer service 

cons: 
*none"}
{"text":"I ordered the carne asada wet burrito with red sauce. When I first bit into the burrito I said out loud \"wow this is good\"! Extremely polite when the cashier gave me my order. He showed me the burrito to confirm that's what I got I'm assuming? Waa impressed by that. Overall great experience. Burrito waa very flavorful. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love it. Great and fast service!! The tacos are very authentic and the meat is good quality!"}
{"text":"Sin Fronteras Tacos

Never been when it was Tostadas and Tacos, but the new management and place is definitely worth 5 stars.

The staff was really friendly. The place is really clean with an A grade.

The food was really amazing and very fresh. I ordered the taco combo with carnitas. And they were some of the best I've had. My girlfriend had the same but with carne asada, and it was just as good. The combo was served with rice and beans. Also we ordered some chips and salsa. The red mild was ok. My girlfriend had a different one. Cant remember what it was exactly but it was spicier and she really enjoyed it.

Definitely give this place a shot if youre craving some tacos. Only downside is they don't offer lengua tacos!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place after stopping by a few times when they were closed! Menu selections are similar to those at Robertos but a much smaller menu keeping it more authentic in my opinion. Food was pretty good for my first time. My kid got a wet bean, cheese, & rice burrito that she said was delicious. My boyfriend got 5 rolled chicken tacos with guac. The guac was very lemoneyy but super good and the tacos were big, puffy, & fried just right. I got a carne Asada quesadilla combo with rice and beans. I will say that the rice could use a bit more flavor but other than that, food was great. Not greasy like I imagined. Did have that home cooked touch as if it were cooked in your grandmas kitchen. Service was great. Super friendly and answered any questions that I had. My only complaint is that I didn't care for the green or red salsa, the red was a little too tomatoey in my Opinion and the green was just kind of bland... But Will try again for sure! For just opening this place has it down though!"}
{"text":"The food was very very bland. I don't know if they just looked at me and saw that I wasn't an authority on Mexican food but I've definitely eaten at enough places to tell the difference. The beans had absolutely no flavor and the rice would've been better if made from a box. Really wanted to like this place but, alas, I should've just gone to a big chain for the money I spent here."}
{"text":"This place is down the street from my house. Went on Yelp to find food places nearby & this place popped up! I did my order online, called & was told my order was ready! Fast, convenient & great customer service. 

I ordered a tacos combo. The tacos we're great, rice is fresh & the beans are okay. Street tacos just like I wanted! I will go back tomorrow :) haha"}
{"text":"My family has been sick so I didn't want them out in public so we ordered in. I'm so glad we found a Mexican restaurant that's good and delivers. Great delivery time, next time I will get all the stuff for the nachos on the side bc it was a little soggy but still good. My kids love the rice and beans! Thanks for saving this whole sick family!"}
{"text":"Passing thru Vegas and found this hidden gem, good food, meat was tender, beans were good and rice was done well. If I ever come back thru Vegas I'll be sure to stop by again. The service was great and the place is kepped clean.



Only thing missing was Aguas Frescas but the place just opened so I'll let it slide."}
{"text":"Tried Tostadas & Tacos for the first time last week, it was fantastic! Not like your ordinary chain fast food. The owners (who work the counter and cook the food) really take pride in what they serve you! I will drive an extra 10 minutes to T&T, rather than go to my local chain restaurant. I had the Carne Asada Chimichanga, the meat was tender and juicy and the portion was huge! We also got some tacos and nachos. Everything was delicious and very reasonably priced! Will be back as often as I can. Thank you for a new favorite place to go in Las Vegas, Tostadas & Tacos!"}
{"text":"Great menu, prices and fantastic service staff!  I've ordered a couple of times for delivery and I have never been disappointed!  The asada taco combo is  a favorite!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican joint. Loved the carne asada and carnitas street tacos. Very friendly staff. The flan was excellent."}
{"text":"Great service. Very friendly as soon as I walked into the door I was greeted with a great smile! Still relatively new, looks a little empty but food is great right next to were I live so double points on that! Try them out you wont be disappointed! #hiddenGem"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite taco shop. I am in love with this place!
From the minute you walk in, you feel confident that you are going to get some good food. 
It is a super clean and friendly environment. The ordering is easy with large menus on the wall (pictures too). 
I think it was the picture on the wall of the chimichanga that sold me. I got the Asada, and when it was presented to me it looked exactly like the pic on the wall.
It tasted AMAZING!!!!!
Everything is made fresh with quality ingredients and you can taste the difference in the food here and some of the other large chain taco shops.
I am a huge fan, and will be returning very soon!
Oh, and their flyer they put in the bag says they deliver!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the el pastor tacos. These tacos are not the usual street tacos that were used to getting at tacos el Gordo. We tried a place closer to where we lived so we wouldn't have to drive that far for tacos. Definitely wasn't to happy with these tacos. The tacos tasted to sweet and it felt like they were made days in advance. Not really fresh tacos to me. The good thing about them is that they are close and did our order pretty fast. But I will not be getting tacos here, looks like we will be making the drive to tacos el Gordo till we find a better place to eat tacos at around our area. Will not try tacos from here again"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place.  It's literally down the street from my house.  I ordered the Carnitas taco  combo.  First of all, the tortillas are street size but they absolutely LOAD them with meat.  Plenty of cilantro and onions too.  Yes, they could use a little salsa, but I added some and they really filled me up.  Beans were good (a little spicy, which I love).  Rice was just OK but I love that they add peas and carrots and corn to the rice.  

I do like that their menu is short and to the point.  

Conclusion?  I will be back for sure, and I recommend this place.  But be hungry because there is a LOT of food."}
{"text":"Downtown feel, neighborhood prices! Great food, friendly staff and very clean. We will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"Carne Asada Burrito was pretty good to the last bite, ingredients even throughout.  Only wish it was bigger, but I value quality over quantity.  2 thumbs up!"}
