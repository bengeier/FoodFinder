{"text":"Early morning Sunday breakfast. The pulled pork eggs benny was unexpectedly great, the service attentive and knowledgeable. The latte was dreadful (from a machine) but brewed coffee aplenty was on offer as apology. Happily.  And a lovely setting. Cosy on a cold November morning. Free wifi too."}
{"text":"I went here for a Sunday brunch. I was in a bit of a hurry. The service was fast. The server was very friendly. The food was good. I had the eggs benedict I asked to replace the bacon with salmon. They were very accommodating. I do think that this place is a bit overpriced especially for brunch..."}
{"text":"Great location.  Great view. right prices for location I guess. I had the vegan pad thai  which is more of a salad but still juicy and delicious and my sister had the biana mushroom truffle pizza. Flavors were amazing but very slopping pizza. Too much cream made the inners corners of pizza slice so sloppy. Would like to try their weekday specials next time."}
{"text":"Great spot to people watch. Love the food, but a bit too heavy on the salt these days. Lots of vegan options as well. The staff have always been super helpful and they regularly change up the menu. Brunch, lunch, dinner. I've not been disappointed."}
{"text":"O&B is a cute addition to King St. I did eat dinner there once, and although the food was good, I found it pricy. I keep meaning to go there for brunch one morning! Anyways, O&B is now my go to for unique cookies ($1.00) and super yummy cheese and chive scones. ($1.50) I was really surprised about the cookies last time I went. They had toffee chocolate chip with pretzel salt, white chocolate cherry and of course, the chocolate chip standby."}
{"text":"Fantastic location in the core downtown.  Went here for lunch.  Service was good and food was very good.  Priced a bit high, but it's to be expected considering it's O&B not to mention that it's in the TIFF building I would repeat :)"}
{"text":"Here for brunch on Saturday. Loved it! White bean soup, beet salad and cafe americano and capuccino were fantastic. Will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Canteen last Friday night, expecting an awesome meal as the other O&B restaurants are great.  My lamb gnocchi was on the small side, and was only OK as it lacked depth of flavour.  His brisket sandwich sounded great on the menu, but rather than your typical brisket sandwich overflowing with meat, what arrived at our table was a joke.  Three tiny slivers of meat and barely any cheese.  We ended up having to go elsewhere for second dinner.  Bottom line: nice atmosphere but tiny portions.  Don't come if you're starving!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for food before seeing a play downtown.  Evertying is reasonably priced.  I recommend the lamb tagine.  Also, during Jays games there are $5 pints and $6 sandwiches."}
{"text":"This place is my default place to go along the short King St. strip between John & Spadina when I don't really want to think.  Yeah, I'll admit, sometimes, I don't want to think too hard about where to eat so when I'm in the area, I go here.  Food is good & prices are fair considering its location.  My friend and I came here last night for a late snack.  We were looking forward to their Israeli Couscous but it's no longer on their menu...well, that sucks.  We settle for their Frattau pizza which we chose because it was different from your standard pizza.  It like a breakfast pizza - it comes with a fried egg on top, potato slices, pancetta (yum!), pecorina, rosemary and white sauce.  It was really good but I wished the potato was a bit more cooked through but my friend liked the slight crunch from it.  To each their own. We ended with their delicious lemon posset that was topped with whipped cream & berries.  I didn't really know what to expect since I've never had it before but it was a perfect dessert after a heavy pizza.  It's like a light lemon pudding.  I'll be back, I'm sure. Hopefully they'll bring the couscous back!"}
{"text":"Good service, food is just ok.  Had the grits, it was a bit on the salty side.  Seating is too small, even for 2 people.  Overall ok, but not my favourite.  Nice servers though."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try O&B Canteen after passing by it many times.    The atmosphere is great.  The seating arrangement wasn't squishy or uncomfortable and my waitress was really friendly.    I ordered the Caesar salad and the French Onion soup.  The food was okay - it wasn't bad BUT for the amount that my salad and soup cost relative to the taste and size was mildly disappointing.    My salad was much better than my soup.  It had lentils in it which added crunch to my Caesar.  My soup came in a really small bowl which made sense since it was a starter.  The French Onion Soup though was soggy and really salty.  Can't say I would order it again.    I didn't order dessert because nothing jumped out at me on the menu so we asked for our bills.  Before paying, I went to use the restroom and passed by their delicious looking food-to-go section and the pastry there looked AHmazing.  I don't understand why they didn't offer that on the menu.    I'd go back there, if not for the food, definitely for the atmosphere and its sweet location."}
{"text":"This restaurant looks flash on the outside and is located in the right area, but the food was really bad and very expensive. If you want something good to eat, try some of the other restaurants across the street, it will be well worth it."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero stars. I came here with a large party this past Sunday. After waiting for an hour and half, we still weren't being served. My boyfriend's mom asked a waitress why we weren't being served and she told her that it was because we were such a large party. We told her it was a waste of time for us to wait an hour and a half and the waitress responded \"Actually, you wasted my time.\" I've never had a waitress be so rude at a restaurant. If your restaurant doesn't have the capacity or speed or whatever to seat a large party, fine! At least train your waitresses to be respectful enough to handle the situation. I couldn't believe that she would have the nerve to tell that to a customer. After we spoke to the manager, he apologized to us for not serving us sooner. We were already past that and wanted a full apology from the waitress but got nothing. Definitely would not recommend this place if they condone that kind of behavior from their staff!"}
{"text":"When I first walked into this place, I was visually impressed.  The restaurant has a great vibe, the food had a very European look and I was excited to find such a place.  I immediately thought of Dean and Delucca, thinking that this must be the Dean and Delucca of Canada.   The food was OK, and a bit over priced.  I had taken a sandwich to go, and was asked if I wanted it heated - I thought this was a bit odd at the time... but soon realized that when I bit into it, you could've cracked a tooth. No wonder they offered to heat, I know that trick in an attempt to soften the rock hard bread.  They charge about 12 bucks for a salad and piece of salmon and you literally have about two bites of salad before you are finished.  Also to mention, that this is located in the theatre district, so naturally you'll experience a more eclectic group.  When I asked the guy behind the counter whether he had an additional salmon salad to go, he literally looked at me for about 30 awkward seconds and acted as if I spoke another language before responding somewhat rude, that everything was out on display.   Overall, customer service can certainly improve.  And, why so cheap on the salad?"}
{"text":"Great food and great drinks!  The menu is a decent size and has something for everyone.  A little on the pricey side, but the portions are decent. Giving 4 stars because it is EXTREMELY loud-you have to shout to be heard by the others sitting with you."}
{"text":"Been here twice and I haven't been disappointed yet.  I can see how it could become crowded before a show at TIFF and how busy it could get. Each time I went with family members after the movie for a more relaxing meal. Had the pappardelle last time and it was a nice combination of duck, spinach and pasta. My brother's pizza looked tempting. [He didn't share with me.]   Our waitress was pleasant and quick. Full marks on food and service. So I'll be interested in going again. I heard our reservation was done online through open table website, so maybe that helps getting in during the rush."}
{"text":"Canteen is in a great location and perhaps due being an O&B product, people may be pegging their expectations a bit too high. Keep in mind that \"canteen\" implies a cafeteria/snack bar (albeit a rather nice one), and you won't be disappointed.  Canteen Butty A \"butty\" is O&B's fancy word for... sandwich. The Canteen Butty is my favourite so far, and for $5, a pretty good value. I would also hold their house ketchup (I don't love) and let the still-runny yolk from the fried egg do its job. Fresh and tasty, this is a great breakfast-on-the-run. Just watch that yolk! Think of it as what a McMuffin or one of those Starbuck's breakfast sandwiches should be.  The Bacon Butty Chock full of bacon, but mine was just regular bacon. Unless I'm not understanding what Canadian back bacon is actually supposed to be. Still, tasty, especially if you love your cured pork. Four bucks!  Home Fries Pass. Not very fried and spiced with paprika(?), which isn't to my taste.  Marinated Cherry Tomatoes This was a nice, refreshing, side. Nothing crazy here, but good stuff.  Almond Croissant Might be worth a repeat, as the taste was good, but missing was the crispy and flaky crunch from my ideal croissant.  While this won't be a dining destination, overall, I think it's a great place to grab a quick bite to eat if you're in the area, especially considering the alternatives."}
{"text":"Mediocre in all respects.  Over cooked burgers and salmon, indifferent service. The place needs a manager who cares."}
{"text":"Ended up here unexpectedly because Khao San Road was filled to the brim, and I needed to eat quickly before a concert. I've always been intrigued by the space, as it is a great looking restaurant. For $15, I had the \"Basa fish taco\" and side \"French onion soup.\" Both paled in comparison to what I had expected. The taco shell was crispy and made from purple corn (no mention of this on the menu). There was a lot of \"coleslaw\" on top, and the rest was unforgivable. Basically, there were globs of crema with errant pieces of flaked fish similar to a tuna salad. To call it tuna salad-like is to be overly generous. It makes me wonder if anyone at O&B has ever eaten a real taco before or knows what Mexican flavours are. French onion soup was bland. Bad food for a captive audience."}
{"text":"I have walked by this restaurant many times and always noticed how busy it seemed. After dining there for brunch on Sunday, I think I can attribute it simply to its location.  In short, the food is overpriced for what you get. Quality and taste are fine, hence the 3-star rating but I feel like I walked in expecting some more creativity from the menu, especially because the décor and space are so inviting - very bright and modern. The brunch menu is pretty standard. The most interesting item on the menu was a kimchi mac'n'cheese that caught my eye but the price didn't seem to justify it (one of our neighbouring tables basically just received a big bowl of what looked like normal mac'n'cheese...). We ordered the smoked salmon croissant benedict and the chef's omelette of the day. The omelette was on the smaller side, and is of the style where the plain egg omelette is wrapped around a filling. The omelette that day seemed to just be sautéed vegetables (no protein).  We probably won't be back and won't be recommending this to any of our friends or visitors."}
{"text":"I love that O&B always has interesting items on the menu, very solid service and some fun drinks.  Canteen is a bright open restaurant, encouraging a quicker meal rather than a lingering one, which is fine on the way to see a movie.    While all the items on the menu sounded great, several of them were not done quite as well as would have hoped.  My wife had a salad that was drowning in avocado, as opposed to the grapefruit and tuna it was supposed to have (great ingredients, not great proportions). My daughter's butternut squash ravioli was tasty for the first few bites, but the unrelenting sweetness of the dish made it cloying after a while and she didn't finish it.  My falafel burger, while an interesting change from either a regular falafel sandwich or a veggie burger, was a very thick falafel could have used better proportion of their tasty toppings.  Again, great ingredients, not great proportions.  We will likely come back, but I hope their kitchen interprets the recipes a bit better."}
{"text":"I have a very refine taste for food , travel around the world and try all kind of cuisines . Been twice at this restaurant and service was good but the food pretty ordinary .  I ordered fish tacos and they came in two hard tortillas ( basically from Taco el paso that you buy at supermarket ) and my partner had a burger with fries pretty bad ( meat was dry and bread same ). I just find an expensive dinner for $80 not drinks .  I don't think will go back again don't mind to pay for a good dish but not for that ...."}
{"text":"Food was nicely presented and tasty but nothing spectacular.   Service was good.   Not sure will revisit as have other options at this price point."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, and a few items on the menu were good, but overall, I did not have a good dining experience.  The waitress was SOOO unfriendly, in fact the most unfriendly service I have had in a long time.   She just sulked the whole time and it seemed like we were inconveniencing her by our mere presence.    I ordered a salad with chicken breast and the chicken was extremely dry.  Most dry chicken I have ever had in a restaurant.  Had to wash it down with water.  My husband had a steak and I had a few bites of his, and it was quite good.    I will just chalk this up to a bad experience and based on other reviews may give the place a second chance for lunch sometime.   Especially since I did enjoy the food and service at Luma and I have had good service experiences at other O and B restaurants."}
{"text":"Went to Canteen for dinner Friday evening. It was cool to dine at the new Bell Lightbox since we'd watched it be built (we live nearby).   The service was great, even a little too attentive. The atmosphere was trendy but totally casual - perfect for an easy Friday dinner. We were seated with no wait at about 6.45pm.  I had a tomato watermelon gazpacho (a special) and steak frites. Both dishes were very tasty and well prepared - steak medium rare. My girlfriend had potted shrimp (a shrimp spread) and couscous. She enjoyed both but the couscous was a bit clumpy.   All in all the urban decor fit in nicely with the intersection of King and John and its many passers-by. The pace of dinner was pleasant with our two course dinner lasting about and hour and a half - the service was not rushed.   We definitely plan to hit Canteen again to try a few other tasty looking menu items."}
{"text":"Having been to Beaumont kitchen at Sherway Gardens and based on the good food and excellent service there (similar menu and makeup) we were excited to try Canteen since we were in the neighbourhood. We were definetly left disappointed as Canteen comes nowhere near Beaumont in terms of food or service. Upon arriving at our table, no one came to serve us for at least 20 minutes so we had no idea who our server was. This left a bad impression as we were also in a bit of a rush as we were meeting up with friends after and were on a time crunch. Finally we flagged a server down to help but it turned out she wasn't our server so we had to wait a while for our food. Quite stressful as we didn't know what was going on with our food nor who our server was still! Finally flagged another server down to ask where our food was and he went to check for us. Had we not asked, no one would've looked after us. Very disappointing as we noticed that other tables were being looked after and told their food would be out shortly! About the food- portions were small for the price and nothing special. My husband ordered the burger and was told fruit salad as a substitute would only be additional $2. When we got the bill, they charged $4! It was such a small portion that it wasn't worth $4! I got the brunch plate with a dollop of eggs, 1 sausage, 2 tiny pieces of bacon and like 5 pieces of home fries all for the bargain price of $16! So all in, Sunday brunch, cost close about $60 and it was so unsatisfactory. The other thing about this restaurant was how hot it was with the open kitchen and open patio doors. It was a hot humid day and they didn't even bother to have the air con going! It was so uncomfortable and hot sitting there and stressing out over the food and service, it was not a pleasant time for the high end prices. Was like sitting in an oven!  Needless to say, I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. The only thing this place has going for it is they have better hours than other places on the weekend so it's more like you don't have much choice if your in the neighbourhood on a Sunday."}
{"text":"Came here for Summerlicious. Service was great and quick. We had outdoor seating so the ambience was different. Waiters could have a little more knowledge of what each dish has but overall the food was worth the visit."}
{"text":"I went here for a small lunch before going to see a movie at the TIFF Lightbox. I decided to get something from the Grab and Go counter and sit outside on the patio. I had a roasted red pepper and mozzarella sandwich ($6), which was really tasty. I also had a refreshing raspberry iced tea ($2something)."}
{"text":"Ha, a flirty waiter always wins points from me.  The service was great--the waiter was friendly, attentive, fast, and knowledgeable about the food.  The food itself is delicious--I shared the bok choy starter (so good!) with my friend, and then I had the pappardelle to myself.  Delicately flavored, with lemon and ricotta, this pasta is an absolute delight.  Desserts are similarly good--the chocolate brownie was surprisingly light, and the lemon posset was just tart enough to complement the richness of the custard.  (Plus we got to overhear the very drunk man at the next table confessing his love for his very uncomfortable blind date--always a good time when it's not you!)"}
{"text":"Great patio, concept & location BUT...have never had a good meal here. Food is always underwhelming. Not recommended."}
{"text":"Had the crab dip and the calamari tacos here for appetizers after work. The crab dip was okay but nothing special and a bit bland. The calamari tacos where rubbery and didn't really go with the soft tacos.   I've been here on a separate occasion for brunch with the eggs Benny which was superb."}
{"text":"This is an average joint, not good, not bad. I feel you are paying more for the location and decor than food. I would come if you were in the area and are looking to get a drink, maybe a small bite if you are peckish, but not a great place for a meal. The portions are on the small side and are underwhelming in taste.   The staff are friendly and the location is great."}
{"text":"A great location but the food is so so, they need to step up. The pizzas are way to dry , over crunchy and with minimalist toppings. The cappuccino is sub par, actually they don't make a good espresso drink at all. The Smoked salmon sandwich Was too salty since the bread was a pretzel based bread with salty cheese and arugula , too many salty ingredients  on one small sandwich . Prices are not that cheap for the small portions offered. The daily soup is not bad, the tomatoes and chick peas soup is quite filling and chewie :-) it's a good hang out place to people watch and spend a mellow evening but as mentioned foods needs to be addressed ."}
{"text":"1st review on Yelp, here goes...  Went to O&B Canteen on a Thursday after work for drinks and dinner.  It was a nice day so we decided to sit on the patio that faces King St - we had no problems getting a seat for dinner around 530pm.  I have been for lunch with coworkers several months before and the wait time can be long if you do not arrive before noon.   Menu (4/5): From what I understand, the restaurant is intended to give off a casual, market-like feel and the menu seems to successfully accomplish this.  Well categorized between sandwiches, pizzas, pastas, comfort/diner food, etc.  There is variety but not too much variety to complicate ordering.  There should be something for everyone here, but at the same time you don't feel like the restaurant's vision is diluted by the selection.  Descriptions and ingredients are simple, which also goes well with the Canteen feel.  Food (3/5): I had the Mac & Cheese and tasted the Beef Burger.  The cheese was much more saucy than I anticipated and very rich, however it tasted very good and the morsels of smoked ham were delicious.  The Beef Burger also tasted good.  Good quality beef and it came with a heaping side of fries (which are some of the best fries I've had).  The burger comes on a nice egg bun, but I feel they need to put some greens in the burger to offset the heaviness.  Presentation-wise, it looks like a slab of meat in a bun with fries.  Perhaps it was intended that way.  Other diner's plates looked good.  Overall the food was solid, nothing mind-blowing or something I would come back for often.  Drinks (2/5): Limited beer selection on tap (2) and quite pricey at 7.50-8.50 for a pint.  Several bottled beer options though.  Similarly, wine by the glass is pricey but there should be a wine with the grape of your choice.  Not a place where you feel like sitting for a long time to drink.  Ambiance (3/5): I thought they did a great job with the decor and ambiance - very upscale cafeteria type of feel.  I feel like it blends in well with the building, street, and area.  Would recommend this restaurant moreso for a nice lunch/brunch.  I don't find it a relaxing place to have dinner.  Special note: the Patio can be extremely noisy and distracting since the patio is pretty open to the street.  So if you are going after work, be prepared for a lot of honking cars, firetrucks, street cars, and pedestrian traffic.  Found it quite distracting to be on the Patio for dinner.    Service (4/5): No delays for drinks or food.  Friendly staff.  Waiter made some recommendations after I asked what the popular items are.    Value (3/5): Menu prices are reasonable for the quality/portion that you get.  Should offer more lower-priced drinks."}
{"text":"I ordered a burger and fries after a big cravings on Saturday night and I was surprisingly pleased with the overall quality and great taste of the food!  The service was quite fast and I read the other reviews and I was uncertain if to come here or not but I was like, what can go wrong with a burger and fries?!  Now I have a favourite place for my weekends cravings. I recommend!"}
{"text":"2 out of 5! Average food. Prefer Jump or Biff for O&B restaurants"}
{"text":"My husband and I went there on Sunday around 2pm. The location is amazing. The place was crowded but we didnt have to wait for our food to be prepared. The food itself (soup, pizza, macncheese) was great. The waiter was corteous. You will not be blown away by the taste of the food or the ambience but considering the location and the prices, it definitely deserves 4 stars."}
{"text":"Completely disappointing. Snarky attitude, slow service. Unapologetic when a simple pasta dish took 20+ minutes after colleague was served and then it was wrong."}
{"text":"Pretty Good! Waiter was very kind. I enjoyed a Gnocchi with lamb sauce, which was very tasty. My sister had a salad with chick pea friters, which she said was great. Pretty cheap, and it was a great restaurant in a pinch."}
{"text":"Canteen is one of the new Oliver & Bonacini restaurants to open up amongst it's esteem collection (Auberge de Pommier, Canoe, Biff's Bistro) to name a few in the gorgeous Tiff Bell lightbox.  With the reputation and force of O&B, I came expecting more from the experience.  Overall it was a thoroughly middle of the road 'canteen' or cafeteria. The interior is an open concept white space with a fresh market cafe and bakery so you can 'grab and go' before heading to catch a flick at the Bell Lightbox or  you can wait to be seated and dine in."}
{"text":"I came for the meat pie (saw it reviewed and photographed in Eye Weekly) so I was pretty disappointed to find out no meat pie - only on Tuesdays. However, I ended up happy. Tasty food, delicious and unique cocktails, and nice, friendly, involved service. It's a nice big open space with lots of windows to King St. Feels relaxed and luxurious. We had pizza and a burger from the menu, not the to-go sandwiches. Highly recommend their custom \"improved\" Caesar, the \"Lazy Calebrese\", which is infused with lots of basil, making it sweeter than your average Caesar. Also the gin cocktail made with Pims, I think it was called something to do with horse racing, was really excellent (just Pims, lemonade, gingerale and cucumber garnish but damn!). The pizza was really tasty, not the best I've ever had but good - and they let me add duck all over it for $9.  http://www.oliverbonacini.com/Canteen.aspx is the main website for this specific restaurant Menu here: http://www.oliverbonacini.com/OliverBonacini/media/pdfs/OBCanteenALLDAY.pdf"}
{"text":"Enjoyable brunch spot. Love the quinoa salad and the mixed greens. Last visit I chose three salads in smaller portions for five dollars each selection which was a nice option.  I prefer the casual atmosphere for brunch/lunch over dinner.  Service is friendly. Atmosphere is vibrant but noise is not deafening. Menu has nice variety and is fairly priced. Would be nice to have more Gluten Free options."}
{"text":"went there for Sunday dinner,  the food wasn't fresh and I couldn't finish my meal,  I had the half roasted chicken.  I like the location and staff are nice,  hope they improve their food quality."}
{"text":"I went for brunch, which is the greatest meal of the day. Despite the service being pretty good and high quality people watching, I was very underwhelmed.   I ordered the Omelet, which is a 2 egg omelet,  stuffed with sauteed onions and mushrooms with melted aged cheddar, and topped with roasted peppers and tomato. The omelet itself was decent, but I certainly can reproduce this at home without much effort. This would have been fine, but the omelet costs $14 and all you get is the omelet. No toast, home fries, or fruit as a side, unless you want to pay another $4-$6.   In my opinion, for $14 at brunch or breakfast I should either be full at the end and be able to say, \"eh, that was decent\" or the food should knock my socks off. I left O & B Canteen a little bit hungry and thinking, \"that certainly wasn't worth it\".   If you like seeing or being seen and want be overcharged for your food, give O & B Canteen a try. Otherwise, I would suggest that you skip it."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks, service!   As a 'just starting off' vegetarian, I had good options. Got the Portobello melt. It was done really well. The right balance of mushrooms - to side ingredients - to bread."}
{"text":"Had a spontaneous late dinner one Friday night here and was surprised how busy it still was. It's a very nice looking restaurant that anchors the new Bell Lightbox and definitely a welcomed addition into the neighborhood. This is probably my first visit to the O&B chain and quite frankly I found the dining experience quite comfortable.   The room is light well with servers wearing plaid and have a really down to earth approach in the restaurant. You can tell by the kitchenware, a lot of Le Creuset, that they didn't spare any expense on this restaurant. The menu mainly consists of sandwiches, salads, and pastas. The only real meat option I saw on the menu was the roasted chicken. We tried the tomato salad which we found very refreshing, the Mac and Cheese which I found extremely comforting (tip: don't eat this right away when it gets to your table, I found the cheese mix was a bit too liquid when hot but after cooled down it was HEAVEN), and the gnocchi which was probably the only dish that failed in our taste buds. We ordered a bottle of wine and no desert and our bill came well under $100. Not a bad spot for an impromptu meal, I think this is a great spot before a movie or a show as it's quick, good, and comforting."}
{"text":"The ambiance is lovely (though the place is SWARMING with staff - while it's helpful, its also a little bit stifling) and the food is quite tasty. For the neighbourhood, the pricing is about what you'd expect. I had the chicken panini with organic greens salad which were both extremely delicious, though the panini was not heated all the way through. A big place with a lot of tables, but they are far enough apart that I could actually get out of my seat without sticking my ass in my neighbour's face, which was a GREAT plus. It's the little things that make all the difference.  Definitely a nice place to stop for a bite before seeing a film at TIFF (as I did) - as a single diner, I was in and out in 25 minutes. Not worth traveling across town for, though."}
{"text":"Took my family to have late lunch at the O&BCanteen. A cold front was moving in and they had the large glass doors open to the street so that we were seated inside but had the atmosphere of a patio.  The staff at Canteen are cheerful and helpful. Nicholas our server answered questions and paid special attention to the kids. I was treating my niece who is 3 and nephew who is 7 with their parents. The child's menu is just right,  burger....grilled cheese...fries...like that. The adults all had the BBQ half chicken with cornbread and slaw on the side. It was really tasty and no one could finish it because the portions were so large. We watched the rain blow through and did not feel rushed at all. I like the high ceilings, open kitchen concept and city feel of this location. Recommend it."}
{"text":"returned here on a gorgeous summer afternoon for lunch and had the gnocchi with braised lamb - made to perfection and to die for. On a beautiful summer afternoon on the patio perfect for people watching and enjoying a hearty lunch - totally mid-afternoon nap worthy!"}
{"text":"Would have given 3 stars if the prices were not so ridiculous. Not that I would not pay ridiculous prices for good food, but this is the definition of mediocrity. $15 for THAT breakfast?? Get yourself off of King St and use the money to hire some better cooks for the morning shift. Can't say I didn't give them more than one chance. Nothing memorable about my dinner there either, so yes - mediocre as well."}
{"text":"A very nice place. Delicious salads and pizza. Love the healthy gluten free options. Great lively patio. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"We visited Canteen during TIFF. We wanted to have wine and ordered two glasses of Pino Grigio. The menu does not offer any appetizer that goes well with wine so we decided to order a Margarita Pizza. The wine (at $9.75 for 6 oz!) was the worst wine I have ever had! The pizza was not any better. It was basically a large bread with some tomato sauce on it. The server was more or less at the same level. He was hardly reachable and provided a very poor service. The poor service might have been due to high volume though."}
{"text":"Good service, location and food/drinks.  The patio on a summer/fall night is great."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner last night with some family members. The service there is impeccable. Our server Christie went above and beyond taking care of my allergies. I have had some pretty awful experiences when stating my allergies at some very high end restos too. Christie was so kind to come back and confirm several times but not in an overbearing way at all! I truly appreciated it! Food was of the highest quality and presentation amazing. The tuna special and lamb gnocchi was JUST PERFECT! Shout out to the kitchen staff!"}
{"text":"The location is great, a great place to get a bite to eat before or after movies at TIFF. The food is just ok, nothing special or unique, portion sizes are decent. Service is a bit rushed some times."}
{"text":"Raced into here after Les Miz for a quick coffee.  (I know!  So tourist.).    Ended up ordering two desserts to share amongst 3 of us.  Had the banana bread pudding and the chocolate pot de creme.   The banana bread pudding came in a beer mug and the pot de creme a coffee mug.  Did they run out of bowls or something?  The bread pudding ended up being a fake!   While the ice cream was very good (almost marshmallowy), I couldn't help but feel as though it was a 'cheating' dessert because it really wasn't a bread pudding, but rather an assembled banana bread sundae.  PLUS it was hard to dig into at the bottom without making a mess of my freshly manicured hands.  Blech.    The pot de creme was covered with a passion fruit custard and while I love me my lilikoi, its flavour was a bit overpowering on top of the chocolate.   IMHO a pot de creme is supposed to be crazy thick, while this consistency was more like a chocolate pudding.    For a latte, a coffee and an espresso plus the two desserts, it came to $26.75.  Not bad considering the location.  If I had to catch a flick at TIFF I would consider coming back here to try a dinner service."}
{"text":"This was going to be a two-star review, but then my partner got food poisoning from eating his med-rare steak here. After waking up in the middle of the night to terrible puking noises, I'm not inclined to give any restaurant who handles their food so poorly/safely/irresponsibly more than one star. (How do we know it was the steak? It was all he ate that I didn't eat, otherwise our meals were identical for that day.)   The ambiance was cute. Kind of like an expensive cafeteria. We love the Light Box, and go there ALL the time (it's the only place we see films), had decided to go see a movie and grab dinner beforehand. It was a bit of a last-minute decision and we were a little pressed for time so we decided to ditch our fancy dinner plans and go here instead, since it was in the theatre building. Huge mistake!  I'd called earlier to make sure that there were a few things I could eat (I'm vegan), and I was told it would take 45 minutes to get in and out, so we'd be fine to catch our film. When we arrived we waited for 15 minutes to get a table, even though there were many available. Our server was TERRIBLE (I would use the word 'sassy') and I have never had worse service in a restaurant. When perusing the menu I told her of my dietary needs and she was like, \"Oh, there's only one thing you can eat,\" and pointed to it, as though I was the most annoying person ever. I said that I had called and the person on the phone mentioned a few other things, and she was like \"No, you can't eat those.\" I asked her to check and she sighed and rolled her eyes, came back 10 minutes later, and said that I was right. She said that what I got (the chili) came with bread, and did I want it. And I said, \"Yeah, bread is usually vegan, but if you could double-check on that I'd appreciate it.\" Again, sighs and eye-rolls. When she comes back she says (mind you her tone is NOT FRIENDLY AT ALL) \"You can't eat it because it has eggs,\" and strolls away without waiting for any response from me. No apology, no nothing. I stop her before she leaves and ask if they have any other types of bread that I can have, and she says, \"NO,\" and strolls away. I know this is a blatant lie; they make sandwiches, so I know they have a different type of bread than the fancy focaccia they have with the chili. I have *NEVER* been made to feel so unwelcome in a restaurant due to my dietary needs.   The only good thing about our visit here was that he liked his beer and I loved the ginger lemonade. When I asked if it was fresh-squeezed here, she said that it was fresh-squeezed somewhere else. I find it funny that the only good thing about this place is due to outsourcing...   Anyway, the food was bland. He was not happy with his steak and I was okay with my chili but for $16 or whatever it is, I expected double the amount of food, or double the quality. I would have paid $5 for it and still felt a little ripped off, but would have been okay with it by convincing myself 'you get what you pay for.' Unfortunately, what you pay for at Canteen is bullshit.  I wanted to get dessert to go, and asked about the lemon gelato and if it had dairy in it. The server said she'd go check (knowing about our time constraints), went to go chat with her pals, came back 10 minutes later and proceeded to be incredibly sassy and lecture me about the differences between gelato and sorbet, as though I was some sort of moron. Look, lady, I was not fucking asking for a full-scale Wikipedia article on the differences between gelato and sorbet, because frankly I don't care. A lot of gelato spots have dairy-free gelato (and these are authentic Italian places), and if they call it that, I am within reason to ask you if your item has dairy in it. All I needed was a simple yes or no, not a lecture on why I am an idiot. If I had my say in the matter, a tip would not have been left; luckily for our waitress my partner likes to give people the benefit of the doubt that they have 'troubles at home' or whatever, and that explains their bitchy attitudes. I'm not that nice, obviously.   We asked for the bill, it didn't come for 15 minutes. We had to wait another 5 to get her to come and take the card. Terrible, especially since she knew we were in a rush.  We paid $70 to miss the first (and incidentally very important) 10 minutes of our movie, be sassed at, eat mediocre food, and get violent food poisoning. What a winning restaurant! We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"A good go to restaurant in the area. Service is OK, food is decent but nothing amazing. Good pulled pork and beet salad.   I give it a 2.5, barely a 3. I gave it a 3 because of its convenience."}
{"text":"We went here recently and the food left us feeling sick and nauseated. Would not go back. There are plenty of better restaurants on King St."}
{"text":"Unique fare and a great location. Definitely worth a visit when visiting the Lightbox or the festival."}
{"text":"i came here twice in two days.  i was recommended the spot by a local since she knew i was in town for a conference.  for the same price of a sammie in the convention, i could get a lovely toasty sammie on the best bread i've had in ages.  the second day i went back for the mac n' cheese that came out piping hot and cheesy good."}
{"text":"Ok, I should say we went there because we were disgusted by the Dazzling Modern Monster, and still had 30 min to go before the movie. And Canteen was just fine. Nice inside, modern and minimalistic, yet friendly. Cold beer. Friendly service. Will be back and update, but I'd say: you best bet before the neighborhood, and you can hang out long!"}
{"text":"For a seemingly inspired menu, Canteen falls short on execution. Food is mediocre at best, not what youse come to expect for a restaurant in the O&B repertoire.   Sandwiches are okay, salads are small, and mains are specific enough to appeal only to some.   I intend to come back because the location and the potential are worthy of another visit.   Drinks are also quite pricey but at least you get what you expect with them!"}
{"text":"Below average wait service.   We had a dirty dish given (which I had pointed out) then replaced and not once were we offered to top the water up or how things were.    We ordered the Pumpkin \"Pie\" pizza that night - a new item just added to the menu that week.  Oct 6th, 2011  toppings alfredo sauce, pumpkin, gargonzola dolce, swiss chard  taste:  intial creamy, salty but countered with nicely with the sweetness of the pumpkin, and your left with a distinct aftertaste of the swiss cheese. It worked, crust was brushed with butter as well.   Canteen design is very open, it's place to be seen, located in Toronto theatre district, there's pinpoint spot lighting above most of the tables in the restaurant, glass and sliding doors. it's can be chilly these coming months ahead so be advised."}
{"text":"Me and my cousin went there for a cup of 'java' after enjoyed Summerlicious @ The Red Tomato, across the street. We were being asked inside 'Canteen\" by a tall girl (who grabbed the reservation table' list' tablet) who the ones brought me to the table located next to the street outside. We finally ordered for 1 cup of coffee and 1 cup of cappucino. Then, the lady who served us & showed her 'unsatisfied' 'face' and notifed us either we \"should\"   'grab-and-on' next time if we just ordered for a cup of coffee, since all the tables on the street is for lunch / entree dinner; or sit at the quiet corner, from other side of diner' tables. We then offered we can sit on that quiet corner, but she simple asked us to stay and enjoyed this time. For my point of view, the host who brought us outside of 'Canteen' should ask if we come for dinner or just for a drink, ahead.  Atmosphere : U can get the same (or even better) patio-street style from other restaurant.  Price - Moderate (but I would suggest go somewhere else, if you would like a strong taste of coffee; esp. they don't serve dessert or even slice of cake).  Service (1 out of 10) : 3 - 4 out of 10.  Selection : You can get better and more selection from other 'grab-and-go' or take-out cafe.  Will I go back ? : NO. Defintely not.  Alternative Suggetion : I might try LUMA (Upstairs of TIFF) next time - better street view."}
{"text":"It was one of the few restaurants open at 10 AM. The vibe was very open and chill. We sat outside and I ordered a Thai bowl, which was so good. It had quinoa so I was full for a long time. The.service was quick and very friendly. I am starting to see a common theme here."}
{"text":"I knew I was in trouble when my lamb tangine arrived before my cocktail. The lamb tangine was anything but fresh.  It was served with a lump of rice and was only lukewarm.  No evidence of any fruit .. It was so bland! I did not eat most of it, complained but no credit.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"A solid 7/10. I came here with a large group of coworkers for lunch. We all split an order of spring rolls and the artichoke hummus. The hummus was delicious, the fresh mint was a nice touch. For my entree I chose the falafel burger. Overall it was good, a bit dry, but didn't \"wow\" me. They have quite a few vegetarian options on their menu so I'm sure I'll be back again at some point to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday evening for dinner. We got a scotch and the chili ginger Margarita. The margarita seemed watered down. We also split the leg of lamb pizza which was the special for the night. The pizza was quite nice. It's a nice spot to check out but I wasn't vowed enough to return."}
{"text":"We gave this place a Chance because it looked alright. We sat on the patio and ordered drinks and the hummus to start. The drink came quickly but after a while it became obvious the server forgot to punch in the hummus. That dish should take no longer than 4-5 min and it took 20-25 minutes to get the hummus. As we waited longer and asked for our humans the second time, we just got turned off by the whole place and decided to not order our mains."}
{"text":"within a span of a few days my family and i visited a few o&b restaurants, starting with luma then canoe then the canteen.  surprisingly? canteen was our favourite, and we enjoy your fine dining i assure you.   Canteens idea is very well executed, the food clearly fresh , and the service very warm. the whole look and feel of the place is very vibrant, the menu excellent labelling items such as : gluten free , spicy , vegetarian , etc..   the food was honestly presented and the flavours were rustic and simple.  decent pizza for sure, lamb gnocchi was melt in your mouth, fabulous beet salad with not too overpowering dressing that had a dairy like feel but was dairy free.  best place to judge a canteen is their burger. and their burger was very well presented and well done, gorgeous shiny bun , you can  tell the details were attended to.    This is a fabulous place to go to with family or friends, and its balanced enough to offer that casual fast food offering on the menu as well as more elegant exotic international dishes such as an indian shrimp curry, green curry tofu , italian fare, falafel, kebabs, etc...   all in all a fabulous internationally themed canteen that truly exceeded our expectations..     WELL DONE"}
{"text":"Was a beautiful Sunday afternoon and the city was busy with all the TIFF screenings. Stopped in for brunch and the hostess was totally calm and engaging despite the fact that the place was rocking. Seated after 10 mins and well, that's where the other reviews seem to have a common theme. The food is great, the service- not so much. A waiter from another section was more attentive than ours; nit picking I am not, things like a spoon for my soup and my husband's oatmeal. Salt and pepper? Nope. Refill on water? Not really. And then he forgot our apps and tried to bring them with the meal- just mine, he said the kitchen \"overdid\" the other and it would be out soon. It was a bad cover and would have been better to just say \"my bad and can I get anything else for you?\""}
{"text":"Definitely love the atmosphere and the layout is awesome. Plenty of sunlight throughout the restaurant.   However, food-wise, it's nothing spectacular. And to be quite honest, seems a bit too pricey in relation to quality. They clearly market themselves as a more up-scale place but I would've expected the quality of the dishes to be better to match that standard."}
{"text":"Pretty sad breakfast/brunch menu where there isn't much variety in options. A lot of very healthy smaller dishes and then very generic eggs benny, and jumps to like steak and eggs type. My friend and I picked this place randomly as we walked down King st because we saw there were many customers inside. We saw that as a sign of good food! I got the eggs benny and it was unhearty and too simple! Most places usually give 3 eggs and lots of sauce, lots of potato wedges. The plate was big compared to the food serving so it just looked like they were skimping out. Taste was okay but for such a simple eggs Benedict it's definitely better at say eggsmart or Cora's who even give you toast and lots of fruit for the same price."}
{"text":"Great location, good atmosphere and good service, but the food is mediocre at best. The vegetarian burger is really plain, it desperately needs flavor. The French fries are good though and the house ketchup is tasty."}
{"text":"I decided to come to this place for lunch after getting an O&B gift card.  The restaurant is quite spacious, with outdoor patio seating which is great for people watching.  I was seated quickly as it wasn't too busy at the time (after the lunch hour rush).  I had the soup of the day, which was cream of mushroom.  It was rich and creamy, with bits of green onion in it.  It didn't taste like it was from a can.  I also ordered the turkey panini with a side of fries.  The sandwich itself was tasty, but the fries were forgettable.  My server was friendly and attentive.  Overall, the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't out of this world either.  If I am in the area next time, I might consider going back."}
{"text":"Enjoyed their delicious wild salmon with orzo followed by a wonderful lime tart Brule with sour cream ice cream. And I had a vodka iced tea with ginger.... that was the best meal ever!  All while waiting for a TIFF Movie. Great way to enjoy the festival!"}
{"text":"I went to O&B Canteen with my boyfriend for brunch last weekend.   We arrived at 10am and asked if they had a brunch menu, the host smiled, said yes, and sat us on the patio. There were maybe 4 other tables sat at this time.   We were shocked to see that there were only 5 things on the brunch menu. 4 of which had meat in them. (I'm a vegetarian.) Our server let us know about the chef's omelette of the day which contained bacon. I asked if it were possible to get the omelette without and he said \"No, it's a premix. We can't take anything out.\"   How hard is it to mix 2 eggs with spinach and cheddar cheese for a guest who cannot eat anything on your menu? This was when we should have left to find another brunch spot. Because everything else had meat, I had to order the eggs and toast. It was $9 for 2 pieces of toast and 2 poached eggs which were so bland it was ridiculous. Not to mention there were no salt/pepper shakers or ketchup at the table.  My boyfriend got the Eggs Benedict, which was also very bland. He wanted ketchup for his homefries and was almost finished his entire meal by the time the server came around to ask if we needed anything.   This was a terrible experience not only because the server was very non-accommodating but because the food was terrible. We will not return."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to this restaurant, the location is great, the staff are friendly and the atmosphere is nice! We ordered the half roasted chicken, and man was that horrible, I could not eat it, the chicken was not fresh and tasted really bad. I am not sure if the main meals are not their strong sale, but I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and obliged my special requests. Food was well prepared and presented. Fun atmosphere. Medium rare Lamb chops, French pate and cappuccino were satisfying. Washrooms are clean and spacious."}
{"text":"I usually go to the canteen a few times a month.  Simply because it is close to a lot of cultural centres and the food is fairly affordable for downtown.    I used to love to introduce my friends to the restaurant.  However after the poor service I received before going to the theatre, I will never do that again.    The hostess greeted us during a busy time on the weekend.  She estimated that the wait would be 15 mins.  40 mins later she arrives again to ask when we needed to leave for the show.    After rolling her eyes, she said it would be impossible to serve us dinner at that time, even if a table was available.  And suggested the take out counter.    This was acceptable.  We weren't especially picky.    However she arrives again, to ask if we had given her the REAL time for when we had to leave for the theatre.  Did she think we were lying?  I was offended and embarrassed that I had brought my party here.  We interpreted her and stated the same time.  She seems unsure and leaves...  returns a minute later and offers us a table for dinner.    We decide to leave and return after the show, hoping the service would change.    When we come back after the show, we ask for a table for drinks, a small bite and dessert.  Since it was extremely late for dinner (past 10pm).  We are asked to leave since they are only sitting for dinner.  The entire place was almost empty with only two couples...  who appeared to be doing just the same thing.  Plus this is something I have done many times at the Canteen.  My friends asked me to never bring them back to the Canteen.  I was embarrassed by the poor service and attitude.  I will never bring anyone to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"This place is overpriced and overhyped.  Food is subpar - avocado on the watermelon salad was terrible, seemed store bought.  Gnocchi definitely was not homemade-dish was very heavy and not anything to rave about.  Would not recommend.  Only positive is service was nice"}
{"text":"Atmosphere was good, food...overcharged.  Roast Chicken Cobb salad...it came with half of a iceberg lettuce, literally that was the salad with some dressing and they claim there was puree avocado which I could not taste any, and chicken was invisible.  I actually asked where was the roast chicken when the server brought it. I could not see it until it was pointed out to me....yeah... And that plate was $14...seriously....not recommended."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch the other day and got the mac n cheese. Presentation wasn't the greatest...  looked a little bit of a mess (I know I know... it's mac n cheese)   My real issue was how damn salty it was. It had bacon lardons which were pretty difficult to chew, and there was A LOT of them. I know bacon is salty, but after a few bites i couldn't eat any more with out drinking a ton of water. I didn't want to send it back because I didn't have much time, but I wish I had. It was pretty disappointing.   Our server was attentive and nice, no problems with service.   On our way out we grabbed a to-go coffee. The coffee was good. I'd come back for that!"}
{"text":"I liked this restaurant the past 3 times I've been here. But today we went for Winterlicious and it was terrible. I tried to salvage whatever I could by adding salt and pepper, which I rarely do, because I was so hungry.  We should have known right from the start that things weren't going to go well. They kept calling (3x) my friend who made the reservation to ask if we were sure we wanted to keep the reservation. Maybe that was a hint to stay away?  Nevertheless, the menu and comments are below.    ROASTED BABY CARROT & SQUASH SALAD: apple, buffalo ricotta, spiced walnut, Anaheim chile & honey vinaigrette The salad was bland. There was no apple, no vinaigrette, the walnuts tasted burnt. It was unsalted.  GRILLED SALMON: baby spinach, radicchio, hard-boiled egg, mushrooms, BellaVitano cheese, challah crouton The salmon and the egg were ok. But even I can boil an egg. There was no indication this would be served with a raw spinach and cooked radicchio salad. I thought the greens would have been cooked. Or there would onlu be some raw radicchio. There was way too much cooked soggy radicchio. It was charred and too bitter, and ruined the meal. I had to remove it to make the salad tolerable. If you're going to include bitter veggies they should be balanced with oil and acid eg vinegar or citrus. This was terrible. Also, there was no cheese. The rest of the salad was bland.  The dressing had no flavour or salt.  APPLE CRUMBLE. cinnamon crème anglaise Was mostly crumble and sauce. Hardly any apple.  I complained and the nice waitress brought the other dessert.  BANOFFEE, chocolate crumble, banana, toffee pudding, vanilla Chantilly There was no chocolate crumble. Bottom layer had the colour, taste and gritty texture of crystallized honey. There was a very thin layer of what might have been pudding but it wasn't smooth and you couldn't taste it because the honey crystals were overpowering. Top layer was the cream, and they stuck 2 banana pieces in it.  Maybe the other options would have been better."}
{"text":"I visited the O&B Canteen this week to a catch-up lunch with a friend.  They have a great patio setup along King Street and John Street.  The space is big, bright and inviting.  Service for lunch was ok;  a tad bit slow considering it was a Tuesday.  The food though was a miss - I got the roasted half chicken and my chicken was a bit on the dry side.  The side of zucchini and olives was heavy on the olives and dressing.  I ended up finishing my plate because I was hungry not due to taste.  My friend ordered the chicken cobb salad which came out at a de-constructed salad with a wedge of lettuce in the middle of his plate (something he was not expecting).  I have heard good things about their brunch; maybe I will come back to try it out."}
{"text":"I'm a bit torn on how I feel about this place, to be honest. I live close by, but hadn't eaten there until this weekend because their patio looked appealing. My friends and I got a great table in the sun-- and because Canteen is in a great location, it was nice for people watching and enjoying the activity of the city on a busy day.   We went for brunch and I got the steel cut oats. While described as having apple and cinnamon in them, the bowl actually came with peanuts, peanut butter, and bananas on top as well. I was actually happy because I'm obsessed with PB haha, but i think it's odd that this isn't listed and our waitress didn't mention it. A lot of people have peanut allergies so that's definitely something to consider.   The overall service was mediocre. A bit slow, and they seemed to be almost over staffed? A bit bizarre.   To be honest, I was still enjoying myself regardless, but my entire experience was sort of jaded at the end when our bills came. I ordered a mimosa, which wasn't listed on the menu, and it was 14 dollars! My meal was only 8... Ahah.  I live and work in the entertainment district so I'm obviously no stranger to expensive drinks and food, but I thought that was a little ridiculous for a small glass of OJ and champs. Also pretty sneaky since it's not on their drinks or brunch menu.   Overall, mediocre experience. I'm planning on trying it again for lunch sometime soon, because their salad menu is appealing. But definitely not in a major rush to get back."}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of $10 sandwiches, because I can never find value in them. But what I didn't realize at first about Canteen is that their ingredients are a) organic b) locally sourced and c) home made, whenever possible.  So even though you're ordering a Butty, a breakfast sandwich that looks like just a egg with cheese and slapped on a bun, it's actually a free-range egg on a home made bun, with home made ketchup.  Pretty cool. And somehow tasted better, after knowing that.  In general, I like the food at Canteen, but I have to keep reminding myself it's fresher and more organic, and that's why I'm paying a few bucks more for my meal.  I think my favourite dish I've gotten at canteen is the daily french toast served at brunch. It came with mounds of fruit, jam, and creme fraiche over delicious french toast."}
{"text":"You know what I think is major to the success of the O&B chain of restaurants?  There's something for everyone - it doesn't particular stand out and it isn't awful at anything either.    Located in part of the TIFF Lightbox theatre, Canteen feels both chic yet casual at the same time.  The high ceilings, exposed light fixtures, large windows, wood-topped bar, and the generally open feel of the interior is welcoming.  So too is their 3-paged menu, offering just enough variety to suit food allergies and preferences (gluten-free/vegan/nut-free, anyone?) yet not so vast that they fall into that dreadful \"jack of all trades\" rut.  I ordered a side of fries plus octopus panzanella (a bread \"salad\").  The fries were crispy, in a medium cut size, sprinkled with crisped parsley and a generous smattering of sea salt.  The sous-vide then grilled octopus was considerably less salted, and while not bad, I have to admit it didn't stand out too much for me.  It was plated nicely and the tentacles looked both spooky and lovely amongst the thinly sliced, colourful zucchini, but somehow, I feel like it wasn't as flavourful as it looked.   I liken Canteen to a middle child: not at the top, not the lowest. Inoffensive and perfectly acceptable, but not my choice dining pick.  Whew, good thing I don't have any kids..."}
{"text":"\"Middle of the road, non-offensive\" is the best way I can describe Canteen, a cafe/restaurant located on the ground floor of the TIFF Bell Lightbox, and right at the corner of King and John.  As far as cafes go, this is is certainly one of the best in the downtown core for its atmosphere and design. I've come here several times with friends and had great experiences hanging out watching passersby and relaxing with a drink or cup of coffee.  However, the experiences have sometimes been lackluster. The first time I ever visited (while waiting with a group of co-workers for someone who was at a party upstairs), they brought us cold coffee and it took two tries to get them to bring a fresh pot. Subsequent experiences have been better, but the service is still a bit spotty at times. My friends and I have had to wait before to get a bill because the server was nowhere in sight.  The inside hosts a very rustic feel, with menu options and daily specials written out in chalk on a board high above and an atmosphere that feels like one of those New York diners. Prices can be a bit high, but as I always say, it's Toronto. When you come here, it's not just for the food. People-watching (especially during TIFF) is one of the main reasons to visit, especially if there's a premiere happening down the street.  It certainly is one of my favorite locations to visit for a hangout in the downtown core, and one I will continue to visit in the future."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group for what we thought would be lunch but ended up being brunch. The restaurant was pretty much the only place able to accommodate a group of 22 though (at two side by side tables) so I guess I can't complain.  The service was generally good. We had two waitresses and they were on top of us quite a bit, which was good because we ended up drinking quite a few mimosas. When we finally ordered, one table got their food way before the other. It seemed like most of their table had finished their meals before our first plate arrived.  I ordered the Calamari Tacos and had two beers. The beers weren't bad, although I tried to switch beers after my first, and the waitress brought me the same beer I had the first time (which wouldn't have been an issue, but it took 20 minutes). When the Tacos arrived they were actually pretty good. I probably could have used a little more portion wise, I feel like I've had larger appetizers than that, but again it was tasty and relatively cheap at only 13 dollars Canadian.  I liked the spot, but it left a little bit to be desired. I understand the issues I ran into (wait times, getting the wrong drink, the difference between tables in meal delivery) were largely because of our group size, but honestly I would expect that if you're going to seat that many people you should be able appropriately wait on them."}
{"text":"Food and service are good. Nice outdoors area. Nice place to hang out with a friend. Ordered the burger with onion rings and it was excellent. My friend ordered a pasta dish and it looked really good - she said it was excellent.  I'll eat here again on my next trip to Toronto."}
{"text":"Dinner at the Bell Lightbox during TIFF - what could be better?  I made a reservation for 7 without issue on a Friday.  We arrived, and our table was ready right away (wow, one star for that).    I really like the way the tables are laid out.  There was tons of space, and enough to have a private conversation with your group - which is a value in itself downtown.  The high ceilings, and clean lines give it a really relaxing atmosphere.    The food selection was good for a casual place, and decently priced.  My pimms drink was delicious!    The service was average, but most new places are still working out their quirks, so I won't go too far with that.  The chef came by after our meal and handed out some caramel popcorn which was a nice touch.    I'll definitely be back, as Toronto's other casual establishments finally have some catching up to do."}
{"text":"This is a good spot for brunch and dinner. The food is solid and the decor leans toward clean lines and minimal sophistication. I'm bumping the rating to 4 stars for consistently competent and friendly service.  Brunch today was avocado toast with scrambled eggs, and a dense pear and chocolate French toast. Their food, every time we've been here, has always been good, and their version of French toast was particularly delicious, doused in chocolate and dense like a bread pudding, served with pears. The coffee is refilled often, and they have mocktails and cocktails available as well.  I keep this place in mind for a reasonably priced dinner option when we're in the area to catch a show. They're reliable and it doesn't break the bank. That's a win for me."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed. For a place that's branded under the O&B name, the canteen was a disappointment. Now, for starters, my friends and I came here for breakfast. Perhaps their lunch/dinner would fare better.  The O&B canteen opens up at 10, which is why my friends and I met here - it's one of the few breakfast places that opens up early. We were seated fairly quickly and our waitress came and took coffee/water orders, but after that, she was pretty much MIA.  Breakfast was actually quite boring. I ordered the Chef's Omelette which was basically egg. Nothing special. It came with a side order of Home Fries, which were more like, dry, baked potato chunks. My friends had the Egg, Toast, Sausage, Bacon combination which was also lack lustre in taste. The sausage wasn't meaty and didn't burst into flavour when you bit into them. The bacon was stringy and soft...not the crisp, chip-y bacon that should start any breakfast.  We were finished  and waited for about 15 minutes until finally our waitress got the bill. My friend had mentioned before that he experienced sub-par service the last time he was here and unfortunately, this time was not good either.  Nothing special. For a place that I wanted to try for a very long time, I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Located in the heart of Toronto's entertainment district, O&B Canteen is the perfect restaurant destination for breakfast, lunch and dinner.    My most recent trip to O&B Canteen was last month during Summerlicious and what an unbelievable experience it was.  I had the Green Bean Caesar Salad to start followed by Buffalo Chicken Tacos and a Lemon Square for dessert. I wish I had pictures to visually prove to everyone how good my meal was.   All around great casual atmosphere, delicious food and a fun time!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great for simple, every day far. The mussels and frites are my go to order, but the fish tacos are also great.   Service is always top notch. Extremely friendly, and very accommodating without being overly in your face."}
{"text":"People are so hard on poor ol' Canteen, and I have NO idea why! I love, love #LOVE (hashtag worthy love) this place.  Granted, I've only ordered 3 things on the menu - but one is so good, I refuse to order anything else (hint, hint chicken/maple bacon panini... you won't be disappointed)  Great location  - the much hated King St W (get over it people) - very open/cafeteria-like atmosphere, attentive service and great menu! They have some interesting things on the menu, mixed in with the classics. Margherita pizza, mac & cheese, pulled pork sandwich, as well as beef tartar, braised leeks & a semolina gnocchi (maybe I'll order this next time)!  One of my favourite things about Canteen is that you can also grab & go, albeit a smaller menu selection (mostly breakfast, bakery items & sandwiches). My second favourite thing...they serve french onion soup in a mini Le Creuset dish! Great, right?"}
{"text":"Place has definitely gone down hill since I used to frequent it when I lived in the hood. Steak was way over cooked and over priced for the measly piece of meat on my plate. Rarely write reviews but this left a bad taste in my mouth. Get it together Canteen, damn."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, grain bowl, excellent, FILLING and unique flavours.. I kept saying stop eating but I finished it... mmm Poke bowl, not huge but once I got into it, I was more than satisfied and full! Fried chicken, large portion.. and no bones?!! WHAT. Beet salad, it's exactly what it says it is, but very tasty! Great place."}
{"text":"What a DISASTER!!! I used to love eating here but the food now is terrible.    I had a steak, french fries and mushrooms.  Steak was bland, so bland that I had to ask for steak sauce (yikes).  The mushroom order was 1 mushroom cut in half.  I wish could've taken a picture to prove it.  And to top it all, my wife's starter and entree came at the same time!  Even though my wife specified to have her soup first.  Plus, one the slices of her side of bread was freezing cold, so cold we think it is a microwaved frozen bread.  I will NEVER EVER come back again!!!!  Please do not come, unless you want to pay big bucks for bland food and a less that desirable service!!"}
{"text":"I think this place is overrated. The service was aloof, the coffee was bland and the eggs were basic. I think it's a convenient place for the neighborhood, but I would definitely skip it for somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have perpetual mixed feelings about this place.  Sometimes I'm shocked I paid so much for \"mac and cheese\" that tastes like boxed alfredo and stunned wr paid \"per person\" for the usually complimentary Q Water.  Other times, I'm celebrating the 15 dollar soup and sandwich takeout combo and trying to peg the flavour of the chickpea and tomato soup. (Is it curry? HOW DO THEY DO IT?).  The vibe isn't bad and the location is great so I keep coming back. Often have pretty awesome menu items and creative vegetarian dishes, but portions are small and over priced and they really nickel and dime you. Like... add a side salad....i dare you... to a meal already almost baron...  I don't even know if I love or hate this place."}
{"text":"A great spot to grab a bite before seeing a movie at the Bell Lightbox, especially during winterlicious or summerlicious when you can get a great meal for a great price. Also good for meal after pursuing the entertainment district.  Went for winterlicious 2015, the Broccoli Kingdom Salad and Baked Cod were delicious. The snores brownie was yummy, however it was supposed to come with a marshmallow and didn't. That didn't spoil the meal though.  The service was incredibly friendly and efficient. Will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Had dinner here prior to watching a show at the theatre across the street and it was a disappointment. The food took a long time to get to us. The coffee tasted like water. For the price that we paid for our meal, the food was only mediocre. The catsup that came with the steak tasted like watered down pasta sauce. Just skip this place and head across the street where there are other restaurants."}
{"text":"The place looks nice with an open air feel and high end food court atmosphere. The prices look OK till you get to see the portions which are tiny compared to what you pay. We ended up paying almost 40$ per person with one main (salads as mains for my friends) and couple of drinks which is a lot to considering what we ate. O&B seems to have lost its touch and is churning one mediocre place after another.  The food is not bad by any stretch but when you factor in the what you end up paying. Service is great BTW. 3 star for the food which drop down to 2 star if you factor the value in."}
{"text":"Of the seven currently operating Oliver & Bonacini restaurants - I've eaten at 5.  yesterday was, in fact, number 5.    I had a date with Gigi.  I have known Gigi a long time and she has one of the BEST laughs ever.  She was actually one of the first friends I ever made in Toronto.  Sadly, I don't see Gigi often because she no longer lives in the city, but when we do manage to come together, it's like magic.    We grabbed a seat on Canteen's patio - shaded and perfect for people watching.  Canteen ranked low on my O&B charts because it was just average.     My steak frites was good - well seasoned and perfectly medium rare.  I liked the garlic aioli, but I'm not sure how I felt about my steak being placed ontop dollops of ailoi.  Gigi wasn't crazy about her Fregola.  I took a bite (more like five) and had to agree.  There was something off about it - perhaps too much white wine.  Even my love of chorizo couldn't really save the dish.  Her caesar was good, but then got demoted to okay with it's overpriced status.  I know...it sounds like a bad review, but it's not.  The food was good and I'd eat there again.    But can I share a secret, I wish O&B would stop opening restaurants and focus on one and make it the apple of their daddy's eye.  I mean really, when is enough, enough?   Just like friends, quantity does not equate to quality."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times. After my third visit, I won't be coming back, nor will I continue to recommend this place.   Our waiter was...nonexistent and extremely lazy. He brought us water...after a while. He took our orders...after a while. He checked up on our food upon our request...after we waited 20 minutes.   When my baja fish tacos with bean salad arrived, they were very underwhelming. I've ordered this before (with soup but the last day I went all their soups were meat-based) and it was good - which is why I ordered it again. Really, O&B?? You're going to charge me $14 for something that visually resembles and tastes like canned food?  Expected much more."}
{"text":"LOML and I enjoyed lunch with the kids at this very interesting cafeteria. Before I forget, the wait staff were fantastic...best anywhere. We tried the pulled pork sandwiches and a side of wedge salad. Both terrific...we chased it down with Bloody Caesers and Leffe beer. This is a destination for us next time in Toronto."}
{"text":"The brunch was medicore at best. I ordered the smoked salmon benediction and got over cooked eggs with 4 pieces of smoked salmon. The service was slow from start to finish."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure the O & B in it's name stands for Overpriced and Bland.  I had their pulled pork on a bun, which tasted okay. But for $8 you'd expect it to either be bigger, or have some flavor in it. It was the same way with their beef burger too.  But the most disappointing parts of the meal were their sides. The fries were so salty that they were barely edible, and their roasted carrot salad was completely without flavor except for the intense bitter taste you experience with every bite of the salad.  What kind of restaurant hires cooks who can't even cook french fries properly?"}
{"text":"Unique but the food isn't as great as their other restaurant lines. However, this was expected as it provides a different setting and menu.   I came here for Brunch and had eggs Benedict while my partner had the steak. I enjoyed my eggs Benedict dish - but my partners steak was a little on the dry side. Then again, for the cost, we can't really say much.   Environment is really great - neat, cozy, modern twist with the arrangements and decor. I do like how its located right beside TIFF - extremely convenient. The servers are amazing - polite, quick, and helpful. Overall, I would probably go back again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I was here with a friend. Ordered their Canteen burger which turned out to be quite non tasty, one of the worse burgers I've had.   To add on top of it, I got sick a few hours after eating it. Thanks..."}
{"text":"Yes, i admit straight off that this is a bit of a retribution review. Service was slow on a very busy Saturday night: that's totally ok. The problem was that our server was the 'honey badger'. Didn't care. Didn't give a s*#t.  We were perfectly good customers: no complaints, not cheap (drinks for 5, couple of appetizers ordered, mains for all, no special requests, two desserts, a tea and a coffee too). We ended up leaving a decent tip. I ask myself why, though, when the service was so poor. Here were the problems: 1) One order was screwed up. The server wasn't the one who rectified the order; it was the person who brought it. Fine, mistakes happen, but the server should be following up to make sure everything is ok, right? 2) They never brought the side dish/appetizer that was ordered right at the beginning. When all the mains arrived, we alerted the person who brought them (not our server) and he said he would put in that appetizer order again for us. We saw him check this fact with our server and she confirmed the original order with him (but did not talk to us about the missing dish). But, nobody cared enough to follow through on this and the side dish never arrived. 3) One place setting was missing a fork. Not a big deal. But, did we succeed to flag our server down about it? No chance. So we had to make due getting another person to bring the missing fork over. 4) Two sides of fries came with the mains, only one had a small dish of 'ketchup'. Any chance to catch the attention of our server to ask for a second small dish of ketchup? Did the server come by to check on us? Nope. 5) Here's the kicker: when the bill came, the side dish that never arrived was still on it. When we kindly pointed out this error on the bill, she just grabbed the bill and left without saying a word. The look on her face was like it was a huge inconvenience that we caused an error in the bill or something like that. What? All it would have taken to make it all ok would be just a little apology...something along the lines of \"oops, sorry that never came...we'll get this bill fixed right away\". But, no, it was like we were hassling the server with this error correction. Sorry, not cool.  While departing I passed on this complaint (the lack of apology and sympathy about the missed item and bill error) to the manager. She was kind enough to apologize to me but I'm afraid damage is being done by this poor service."}
{"text":"Came here after a job interview. Just wanted to have a beer and unwind. Had the sandwich that was on special and pint on the patio.  Can't remember a lot of detail about the meal, even the kind of sandwich it was. Service was okay , without being friendly or that attentive. Best part was the patio itself which was quite large and not too busy."}
{"text":"Bonus points for the patio! I met up with a bunch of friends for lunch here since everyone works fairly close by. It's a convenient location and in a lively area, so a great choice for a chill weekday lunch. it was definitely busy with TIFF going on, but we were surprisingly able to get a table for 5 at 12:30pm on their patio. What a score!  The server seemed to struggle with the daily special (he stumbled through the pasta option, and I suspect that if we asked him about the dish more elaborately he wouldn't be able to go into detail about it...), was really nice and did a great job refilling our glasses in the summer sun. One of us ordered the pasta special while the rest of us ordered sandwiches (it makes me so giddy with excitement when everyone orders something different!). The food was fantastic. I mean, the portion sizes are a bit smaller than I'm used to, but my chicken BLT was well-flavoured with a good amount of crunch from the bacon and the bread. It didn't very greasy, which is always a bonus. The side-salad was also fairly small but was the dressing was great, and the pickled red onions were delicious!   I was still able to fit in a dessert, but decided against it as we were running out of time. Overall, our lunch took an hour and was about $15 per person on average - a great option in downtown.   Sadly, we didn't see any celebrities. Sigh."}
{"text":"We popped into O&B Canteen after catching a doc upstairs at the TIFF Lightbox. I had just had a huge popcorn so i wasn't particularly hungry. But i saw that they had French Onion soup on the menu, so i was down.  We sat out on the patio. It's certainly a great place to people watch, right there on King St. The food was good, but i do agree with some of the other yelpers that they need to step up on the service side of things. The food came quickly enough, but it took forever for the server to take away my empty bowl when i was done. My glass of water was empty for at least 15 or 20 minutes with no refill and it took forever for us to get the bill as well. The server was really nice though, he just wasn't very good :P  I think i'd come back to try some desserts or croissant which looked pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is somewhere between a 3 and a 4 but based on feedback from others going with a 3. The food is good but I think the prices are just a bit too high for what you are getting here. Been here a few times and mostly settled on the Jerk Chicken which is a decent plate for sure but I just dont think its worth 20+ for lunch.  If you are not concerned about cost and just looking for a decent lunch spot (Ive never had dinner there) then the food is OK, otherwise you can probably find better in the area. You are not going to ever walk away with a meal you wont forget."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with my first time at this restaurant. We had a reservation for 14 but we showed up with 16. They were able to quickly accommodate. I was worried about service time with a large group but we were in and out of there within 2 hours. The food came out quickly and our server was great.  The food was also delish and fairly priced. The portion size was perfect. We left not too full and certainly not hungry (perfect before a night of drinking!). The menu is full of vegetarian options. I'm a meat lover but I made it work! I had the Mac and Cheese and added bacon (only $2 extra). I also tried some of my friend's margherita pizza and it was also tasty.  The location is great and the ambiance is pretty casual. Perfect for a date or for families.  Overall, great location, delicious food, and excellent service!"}
{"text":"Very tasty menu and the heated patio was amazing for people watching. There was a very noticeable cooking haze inside the restaurant that made it very stuffy and weird. Lots of seating outside though, I honestly do not know why more people did not opt for that. I'm not sure if it was just super busy because of TIFF, but our table was obviously not cleaned from the previous diners' meal as there were crumbs everywhere.  We only wanted a snack and got the soup of the day, a cream of cauliflower ($7), and the seared scallops on a bed of curried cauliflower and raisins ($13). The scallops were large and so deliciously sweet. The curry was amazing too though I felt the spice overpowered the scallops a bit. Very spicy and yummy. The soup was pretty good too. It's a bit overpriced in my opinion, but we are paying for location, atmosphere and admittedly quite delicious food."}
{"text":"LAME  We came here on Nuit Blanche to grab drinks and partake in LUMA's $5 lobster rolls (Nuit Blanche Bites). The lobster rolls were great but i can't say the same for O&B Canteen's food and drinks  My root beer float ($7) was HALF filled with root beer.  It didn't even come up 3/4 of the way of the SMALL Mug. Pathetic  My friend's Tomato sandwich ($7) had ONE slice of THIN tomato and 2 slices of Very thin cheeses. The bread was dry and the sandwich looked Beyond pathetic. Disgusting.   I was going to bring my client + co-workers (from SF) here for lunch next week since it's across the st from our office- NO freakin way. It'd be extremely embarrasing. I'll be taking them to Ravi Soups and Khao San Road for lunch instead.   I'm so disappointed right now, i kinda want to cancel my client dinner @ Canoe (affiliated restaurant) on Tues nite.  Terrible."}
{"text":"Canteen doesn't deliver on its promise. Breakfast was a bland cold omelette served on a hot plate. Service was inexperienced and awkward. On the plus side, the artisan breads were tasty and the place is airy and comfortable."}
{"text":"Everything seems to be tiny.  I order french onion soup and it came in a tiny bowl with a lid.  My pop?  Tiny glass.  And the service wasn't amazing even though it was fairly late and they weren't too, too busy.  Definitely shell out the extra $$ for Luma upstairs.  That is where O & B truly delivers at TIFF BLB."}
{"text":"This was going to be a 2 star review until I found a LONG BLONDE HAIR IN MY OMELETTE.  I have black hair.  my waitress had black hair.  That sucker was cooked right in there.  Gross.  Now hair is a flighty thing- this, ostensibly could have happened anywhere but it's just one MORE thing amongst a generally poor experience.  Came here on a busy afternoon weekend brunch. I will admit the space is beautiful- I wanted to go here because it reminded me of the places in New York.  and I also love the pretentious cafeteria sized restos that are filled with sunlight and let you people watch the afternoon away.  but the good experience stops there.  While there is a \"wait for your server to seat you\" sign you have to wait a LONG time for a host to acknowledge you.  And in no way were they short-staffed.  They were just poorly staffed.    Once they see you waiting they are courteous and lovely.  they bring you to a table where you look at your place mat as a menu.  The price range is creeping above the $$ into the $$$ for regular normal items that don't oversell their local ingredients (infact, I'm not even sure if they use local ingredients).  Some item prices are a little unforgivable.  i.e. a 4$ croissant (seriously? that better be a damn good croissant because even the high end/overpriced restos on King West keep it below 3$.  I really wanted to like this place so I didn't give them the chance to disappoint me with an overpriced croissant.  I ordered the hash and my partner ordered the omelette.   The food took a LONG time.  but I don't mind leisurely brunches.  but fyi if you are trying to catch a show- leave a lot of time. My dining partner had to leave for his next appt (that's how long it took to get the food) so I ate alone and had his packed up for me to eat later.  The potato hash was underdone.  The potatoes were hard and less than delicious.  Really very poor.  I would have complained if I wasn't alone and had more time for the dining experience.  the meat was overly fatty - so much so that I spit it out or didn't eat it at all.  The poached eggs on top (which I asked to be poached soft) were the only thing redeeming about this.  But yeah- it ain't hard to poach an egg correctly.  The hollandaise was nothing special- not overly heavy, but not light/ or flavoured with anything special.  Also note that at a place like this I feel it should be a given that I will be offered pepper/salt, condiments etc after they have brought the meal to the table.  They didn't.  The next morning I opened up the packaged omelette- warmed it up and took a bite.  meh- it wasn't good but it was microwaved so its not fair to judge with leftovers.  the next fork lift didnt' come out clean because there was a hair tugging on it.  I was hoping that it was mine but nope- it was VERY blonde and VERY long.  GROSS.  THAT is something I would have definitely complained about if I had been there in the resto still.  The meal (tea, double americano, omelette and hash and side bacon) came up to almost 50$ (including tax and tip). This is pricey but not unreasonable had the food been good and had there not been a HAIR IN THE FOOD.  But all those things give this place a solid 1 star."}
{"text":"We were looking for a light dinner, we opted to be seated outdoors as the street is very lively and also beacuse the indoor area smelled a lot like food and I was worried that smell will be impregnable. The ordered the tomato soup, it was tasty but over spicy , some Mills beers and carrot cake (very good) for dessert. The waiter was super nice and we enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"I had never been to TIFF Lightbox, so when a friend mentioned Canteen, I was intrigued and wanted to give the place a try.  We started with the cheese plate, which was good, but I've had better assortments of ingredients at other establishments, which made me long for another restaurant.  Maybe not the best thing. The green pizza was great.  The blueberry limeade I tried - is exactly the way it sounds, blueberry pulp with lemon - was interesting, but not sure I would get it again.  The service was great - our waiter stopped by often enough to check in and refill our water, but not too much that his presence was annoying.  Would stop by again, if I was in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Had a gift card kicking around for here for awhile - decided to use it one day after the theatre.  Had pretty decent expectations for an O&B restaurant and I really liked the modestly priced food selection.  Sad to say the entire experience was average at best.  From the moment we walked in and were given a dissatisfied look for not having a reservation (at an empty restaurant at 4pm), to the terrible service by a girl who'd rather be anywhere else, this whole experience really wasn't great.  I'd be willing to look past bad service for good food but even that was mediocre.  We varied heavily in our order - salad, steak, fish, pizza..all average.  Not one standout.  Likely won't go back here anytime soon - plenty of other options across the street."}
{"text":"Checked this place out on reccommendation of one of the staff at the Hilton Garden Inn. (Thanks!) If I lived in Toronto, I would likely eat here a lot. I LOVED the trendy food selections, laid-back atmosphere, and the fact that we were able to sit inside and enjoy the cool air while sitting next to the patio doors and watching the hustle and bustle of an evening on King St. I had the salmon over soba noodles and bok choy with pickled vegetables -- and there wasn't one thing about it that wasn't great. The fish skin was crunchy, the tamari/pineapple glaze was sweet yet not TOO sweet, and my first experience with soba noodles found me loving them. Service was good and so was the wine. Carrot cake for desert was enjoyable, too! Yum!!"}
{"text":"I love  TIFF year round beyond the insanity of the film festival.  It's always great to come here for a bite to eat before or after catching a flick at he Lightbox.  Thanksgiving Day they have a brunch menu.  A great variety to please any palate.  We ordered avocado toast with scrambled eggs and the grain bowl.  Service is always friendly and you spend some time trying to interpret wtf is on the back of their t-shirts for entertainment."}
{"text":"I really like quite a few of the dishes here but it is a bit on the expensive side.  We ordered the kimchi mac and cheese for $17 and the pesto chicken fusilli for $16.50.  The mac and cheese was really good although it didn't really taste very much like kimchi.  We both found the pesto chicken had just the right amount of pesto.  The service wasn't the greatest despite it not being very busy.  We had to wait a while to get the bill.  They've changed their menu since I went there in the summer but they have quite a variety of options.  I'd definitely eat here again to sample their unique dishes."}
{"text":"Taking a break from the Stanley Kubrick Exhibition at the TIFF Bell Lightbox, my twin and I stopped into the TIFF O&B Canteen for a quick bite. The time was mid-afternoon, after 2pm, so the Canteen was not especially busy or packed full of patrons. We were seated by the service windows of the kitchen immediately and our waiter offered us water soon after.   We placed our orders, my twin ordered the Breakfast and I ordered the raw vegan pad thai. I later added the corn chowder because it sounded very delicious.   My experience here wasn't the best, mostly because our server was not attentive and very slow with the food service during non-peak hours. I would be more understanding if we ate around noon with twice as many patrons in the dinning room, but of course, that wasn't the case. I was very annoyed that my raw vegan pad thai sat at the service window, staring at me, for at least 10 minutes before they served it to me. I would be less annoyed if the server just owned up to his slowness instead of throwing the salad chefs under the bus... He said they make the salad fast without syncing with the table's other orders.  Admittedly the hostess and server both asked if I wanted my pad thai replaced, but we were pressed for time and I was very annoyed by then. It really shouldn't have happened in the first place: you are serving lunch in a world class city, professionalism and time matters. #protip  The food was mediocre. The corn chowder was not a chowder, just a soup. It wasn't chunky and with very few pieces of actual corn.  The raw vegan pad thai, it wasn't exploding in flavours like most vegan dishes -I would know coz I am the veggie queen after all. And I can't help but think it would have tasted better if I had received it when it was ready and not after our 10 minute- staring competition. The potato from my sister's breakfast was hard like rocks, the scrambled eggs did not look fluffy, and the bacon looked like a crumpled mess.   So in summary: it was a poor experience.  The good news is that if they see this, they can always improve. Oh yeah, most importantly: this is Toronto, you're in the big leagues -act like it. Be professional. Own up to your mistakes. Don't make excuses and don't throw your colleagues under the bus."}
{"text":"I was certain this would have been a 4 or 5 star experience for me and my group. I've been to the Bell Lightbox many a times since it opened but only recently went to the Canteen for a Sunday brunch . Would have liked lunch but that starts at 2:30 on weekends.     It's 3 stars because while the food was well prepared and tasty (small portions though), my experience was marred by a few negative experiences:  1) When it came to paying our bill, every single menu item (apart from beverages) were bumped up a dollar. When asked about it, our waitress said that's because our menus were old and they had run out of new menus to fill tables up. That's a little ridiculous isn't it given that the restaurant is only 3 months old and they really should have mentioned that to us before the bill came to us?  2) A couple of minor negatives against them that I understand happen every now and again, but just made the experience less fun was: a) We had a fried egg under our table from the group previous to us....that was not fun, but I they were rushing to prepare the table for us b) I ordered a fruit pastry, but it never came and instead the bill was slammed in front of us right after we finished eating and had not even asked for it.   3) Service could have been faster and we had to keep asking for water and coffee refills, but it was a full house while we were there.   Prices are not too expensive though almost everything on the OLD brunch menu would have been under $15 and their bakery items were a big hit with everyone! Especially the chocolate and almond croissants. My steak and eggs was more like \"beef patty\" and eggs, but it was delicious nonetheless.   I will definitely be visiting the Canteen again, but overall for an O and B I was not impressed, but it's a great compliment to the lightbox and will definitely be my place to go if I want to some food to \"grab & go\".  Note - they take reservations only for \"big\" groups, and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We went there at around 9:30 and we were a big group on a Saturday, it was one of the only places that would accommodate 10 guests on a short notice so kudos for that.   Don't go for the food but go for the picturesque restaurant and people watching. Want to show off your outfit of the day? It's an all glassed restaurant on a busy intersection so why not! All the food were presented instagram worthy so go nuts with the phone camera."}
{"text":"Liked the environment, reminded me of LA: trendy deli-style dining, a bit expensive, but what trendy thing isn't?  Very mediocre, totally go if you want to splurge with a few friends.  Interesting menu, with items like \"pumpkin pizza\".  I had the  BEEF BURGER, it was the treasurer most delicious slab of meat I've ever ingested.  Maybe it was a good nurse to my night of drinking...  My friend had the PULLED PORK SANDWICH, it seemed a but burnt but she seemed to enjoy it.  Other friend had the O&B BREAKFAST, which was pretty generic.    What gained a star point for me was sharing the MAC & CHEESE, not your traditional Mac and Cheese, it was lined with rich penne dancibg in cheese.  Awesome.  The service was great, attentive guys, young, good looking staff.  Fun environment if you want a glass of chardonnay with your lunch, totally appropriate."}
{"text":"A simple and modern space at a great location. Food and service was just right.  This is my new go-to for affordable and delicious food."}
{"text":"Good food, terrible service. This place just does not have it systems together.  Green bean Caesar salad with chicken  Quinoa salad Salmon with rice  Beer that never came  Food was better than decent but not good enough for me to want to come back here with the service or lack there of"}
{"text":"There's not much choice in quality food in the King Street theatre district. They are all tourist traps, with mediocre offerings and you would have a better bet going north to Queen Street or more East past University.   We were headed to the Princess of Wales and since it was pouring rain outside, this was a shelter even though we had to wait 20 mins with no reservation.   There's a take out section, and a communal table I wasn't sure what it was for. There were couples sitting here, and paying for their meal, but I was told that they aren't seating or serving that section. I realized later we might have been able to speed up the whole thing by ordering from take out and sitting right there.   They give you a pager for you to wait for your table, but the whole thing seemed disorganized and sloppy. We saw people being seated out of order, and I raised a stink when a couple that was way down the list after us (thank you for highlighting people when they are seated), seated outside We weren't even offered that option!  The place is cafeteria style , very casual, but has an air of pretentiousness I'm not sure why. The menu offerings are decent, but small portions for a high price. My husband ordered a lamb parpadelle for $16 that was basically appetizer size. My edamame bean salad (which was surprisingly very good) was $8 and much more filling. The portion size is actually perfect if you want to spend a lot of money ordering apps and dessert.   Dessert we got the Sticky Toffee Pudding ($8) because the lemon custard was not available and the brownie thing looked awfully small. It was very tasty.   Overall, good food, but the value isn't there. Probably another tourist trap, but the food is actually good here!"}
{"text":"A really beautiful patio and very nice host! I love prompt and professional service and I found it here! A cool view of the top half of the CN Tower between buildings and some older buildings in the area made it a great place to stop to get a REALLY COLD Muskoka pint. Come to Canada and have local beer, and Muskoka is a great one to have.   Again the staff checked in with me often and were so pleasant. I was very impressed with this spot I happened to come across. I didn't eat but the food looked wonderful and the menu very tasty (well the food on the menu looked tasty, not the actual menu. But you get the idea  ;)  I'd recommend it to anyone who is in the area!"}
{"text":"My family and I are staying at the Hyatt and we wanted a quick bite to eat, the Canteen was the perfect place. They had their brunch menu at hand, I got the Eggs Benedict and the rest of my family got the Canteen breakfast.  Very simple and rich ingredients, accompanied by a chill atmosphere and friendly service."}
{"text":"Good food. Tasty. Not amazing. Small portion. Fast and friendly service. Went there twice. I will go back more for convenience than their food."}
{"text":"Went here for a Sunday brunch.  Brought my 1 and 6 year olds.  They were very accommodating and set up the high chair right away.    There's a really comfortable ambiance.  The street side has full length windows which opened up to connect the patio and street.  It has an open kitchen concept so the aromas hit you right when your seated, a combination of breakfast and lunch aromas.  We ordered the steak and eggs and the eggs Benedict.  Nice thick steak, cooked almost rare, just they way I like it.  Eggs Benedict prepared in a classical way, light sauce not overtaking the dish with thin slices of ham."}
{"text":"This place looks nice from the outside when I walked by before so I recommended trying it with 3 friends tonight. After 15 minutes of sitting down, I felt bad for dragging my friends here.  Why 15 minutes? because that's how long we sat down with no server coming back to even ask if you want something to drink, no offer of water, no nothing. Actually, we only got service when we worked to make eye contact with any of the staff and wave one down.  We placed our order and it didn't take too long for the food to arrive. However, all 4 of us agree that our food was way too salty. We ordered pizza, mac and cheese, French onion soup and the Thursday grill special \"pork chop with mashed potatoes and red cabbage coleslaw\". Though all of these looked good appearance wise, they were all too salty. The pork chop was also tough and dry.  Value wise, I also thought I could find better tasting alternatives elsewhere. My friend had the smoked salmon sandwich, which turned out to be a tiny 5 inch baguette thing, just a bit bigger than the McMini, plus this sandwich just got 1 thin layer of salmon and then a bunch of arugula leaves. This little thing was $7! I feel bad for my friend who had to eat be satisfied with this and her super salty French onion soup. Prices here are generally not expensive but there's still some expectations to be met and I think we could have had a more satisfying pasta dish, a better tasting pork chop dish and a better pizza for the price in many other eateries.  I also wish the menu provide more exciting choices. There was only 4 pasta dishes including \"salty mac and cheese\" and chef's daily special of \"spaghetti and meatballs\" tonight.  Overall, the experience was disappointing. Maybe the place is good for a quick simple lunch or even breakfast, but not dinner. There are many better places for that."}
{"text":"Great spot for casual pre-show fare... On the way to seeing a movie at the new Bell Lightbox, I stopped in at this spot for a bite to eat.  We were told that there would be a bit of a wait for a table which is fine.  In the meantime, we had a coffee just outside in the lobby. While we were waiting for our table to be set up, we met with the most attentive and polite staff who went so far as to offer us a drink on the house!  What a wonderful and pleasant measure of great service! The menu is very simple with emphasis on fresh local ingredients.  I'm a big fan of simple dishes done well and this place delivers yummy fare indeed.   Superb friendly service.  Good quality simple food and reasonable prices makes this casual eatery definitely one that I will return to (movie or no movie..)"}
{"text":"Popped by for lunch yesterday. I was plesantly pleased with the service there were only 2 of us and all the paired seatings were unavailable so they seated us at a table for 4.   As I was waiting for my friend, I was asked if i needed anything from 2 lovely servers.   They seem to have a slightly modified menu. I have found that with the Canteen and Luma, the food does tend to be a toss up depending on who was currently in the back room.  I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich with Niagara gold cheese and prosciutto (this fan's favourite, next to bacon). It was good but I found that the greasiness of the sandwich really took away from the sweetness of the cheese and the bite of the arugula. My suggestion, less oil, a little less crispy because no one wants to leave lunch with a cut up mouth.  On the side, I had the cauliflower parmesan soup of the day. It was pureed but I think that a little less parmesan and maybe instead of a complete puree, leave some florets for texture.  Happy Nomm Nomm-ing!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with their service! If you want to be respected and valued, do not come to this place. My family and I were planning to go here for brunch but it took them over an hour to serve our food because we had a big group. They served food to people who had come after us and still did not get our food after waiting AN HOUR. When we decided to walk out and find a different restaurant, the waitress told us that WE wasted their time. But in fact, they wasted our time. Unbelievable for a waitress to talk back to customers like that. Do not go to this place, there are much better places to eat around the area."}
{"text":"Came here during TIFF because most of my other favourites on King street had lines and we were hungry. They have a great special for $5 Mill st. pints on game days for the blue jays, so we figured it was a good choice. However, we were sat down and waiting nearly 15 minutes to see a waitress (who was quite nice but a bit absent) and ordered everything right away. Like noted in other reviews, the food is extremely over priced for what you get, I personally think I could make a lot of the things on the menu, which doesn't warrent me spending $15 for a small margarita pizza.. the worst part was that the beer was completely flat because they were pouring it from pitchers. I asked for my second drink to \"not be flat please\"? but they said nothing and it came just the same. Would have much rather gone somewhere else for better service, better ambiance, and better food for the same price. Not to mention there were small bug flying around our table :( probably won't be back"}
{"text":"I came here after Boxing day shopping after finding out that Luma would be closed for lunch service. Disappointed, we decided to check out Canteen for brunch. I ordered the steak and eggs which includes homefries and we also got another bowl of fries with mayo sauce. The homefries were a huge let-down in my opinion; they were chunky and flavourless and not even ketchup saved them. However, the regular fries were great, crispy, had the perfect amount of salt and the mayo sauce complimented them well.   The steak was well-cooked and the eggs were well-done. However, I feel the the waiter mixed up the orders as the steak was  not cooked medium but instead medium rare. Overall, I would come again to Canteen but you can definitely find similar places for a lot cheaper in the area."}
{"text":"\"The patio scene was what grabbed our attention instead with its bustling action and a promise of good times.\" \"Our favourite was Tuna with its tender, small fish chunks of exceptional freshness and quality accompanied by large potatoes with skin and cilantro garnish.\" Just a few notes from our full review..."}
{"text":"Had lunch here recently.  Overall an A-Ok! experience.  Service was very friendly and courteous with smiles all around. Location is fantastic with a nice patio outside and indoors seating arranged, well, like an upscale canteen. Bathroom facilities were sparkling clean, although I only saw two individual cubicles only. While I didn't have to wait, if there are no more bathrooms, I can see a line up if/when the place is full but I guess again, this is a semi-quick grab and go place.  Anyhow, on to food:  Roast Beef was the special and it didn't disappoint! The bread was slightly charred, just how I like it but some might have reservations, so something to consider.  Pulled Pork was actually on a burger bun. It was quite good but a tad too sweet for my taste. Overall the meat was perfectly done though.  Mushroom Soup was ok. Creamy and full of tiny bits of mushroom but I'd never pay $5 for it!  Speaking of which, the prices for the sandwiches alone are OK, but the combo (Sandwich + Soup/Salad) at $15 ($10 for Sandwich only) was a bit too much... So if you want the perfect value, go ahead and get your sandwich without a side. If you're really hungry, you're better off with two sandwiches than with a meager side. Which brings me to my other gripe: The portions! I'd have been quite happy if the portions were about 20% larger, however as it stands, they are a bit stingy for the $10 price. Everything is relative of course and I'm still quite happy with the quality of the sandwiches but slightly bigger portions would have gotten a bump in my star ratings. I do suspect they cater to a lot of business ladies here, you know, the type who eat their pizza with fork and knife! (seriously saw it happen lol) so I guess for those folks this is plenty enough.  Enough complaining from me, now go grab a sandwich. They're not perfect, but pretty darn good."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with my girlfriend and we both ordered the Canteen Breakfast. We were both very satisfied. The amount of food was abundant and it was delicious. The service and ambience was wonderful as well. Oh, brunch is only served during the weekends!"}
{"text":"What a disapointment! We were looking forward to our dinner here as the space is  nice and it is just a short walk from our home. We have also enjoyed a few lovely meals at Luma upstairs.   Well, I don't know it was just an off night, whether we ordered wrong or whether there is a fundamental problem here, but it would take a lot to get me back, and I offer these suggestions in the hopes that management listens.  Given your location and attraction to tourists i don't want people leaving here thinking this is the best TO can do.  1.  Service was polite enough but distracted. We had at least seven  staff dealing with us. One to take order for drinks, come back with said  drinks and take food order. Another to drop off food. A third we had to flag down after long wait to ask for side of bread. A fourth to bring us bread after long wait. A fifth to clear table. A sixth to ask us about how meal was and leave bill. A seventh to handle payment.  my point here is that this is not a great way to create rapport with cutomer.  2. Food was mediocre. My husband ordered the gnocci and I ordered the meatballs with polenta. Both were bland, and what is worse, appeared to have been made ahead and warmed over.  What is more is that while were warmed the dishes were hot, it is too bad the food inside was NOT. Nothing worse than lukewarm warmed over food.   I am not a gourmet cook, but the sauce on my meatballs tasted exactly like the the type of thing i whip up when i am running late and hungry, and i happen to have some canned tomatoes and tomato paste handy. your customers deserve better.     3. If you make it a point to have your staff ask \"is everything ok\" then have them do it at a time when it is possible to do something about it. I had the choice of eating semi-warm food or trying to flag down waiter to tell them. and the solution would have simply been to throw food back in oven for longer wait. The question about how our meal was cam when we were paying. At this point the quetion is moot.  4.  I am no trying to be difficult customer, and usually only complain if something is not cooked properly (hamburger) or one person's dish comes noticeably later than others in a group (not cool. person hould not have to pay for late arriving dish and others at table are left with awkward choice of being poilite and wait or watch food get cold). but please take comments to heart)   ."}
{"text":"Don't call pureed store bought guacamole smeared on bread \"Avocado Toast\". Never again."}
{"text":"Usually come here  for a cup of java and a treat after checking out a show or exhibit at the TIFF Lightbox.  For you fans of people watching, this place is great for that.   The coffee here is okay. Nothing to write home about. I've had their brownies before; once again, just okay. Tonight I tried the salted caramel cupcake for the first time. Surprisingly, it was quite delish. Inside the cupcake is filled with caramel... drool.  Service is pretty non-existent here. They also seem to pack up a couple of hours before closing. It's like me working a 9-5 job and getting ready to go home at 3 o'clock.  A solid three star."}
{"text":"Great location (at the Tiff lightbox) in the Entertainment district for some late night snacks/meals. I came here on a Saturday night and there were no issues getting a table for 2 very quickly. Since it was a bit late, we opted to get the dessert platter instead of more savoury dishes. The dessert platter included their brownie with vanilla ice cream, carrot cake with cream cheese icing, and a new york style cheesecake with a blueberry compote. The desserts were just fine; not amazing, but they were still enjoyable. I'll be sure to edit this review once I've tried their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Very average food. It's basically a glorified cafeteria nestled in the TIFF building."}
{"text":"Horrible! Very expensive and bad service. My food was cold and frozen the bread. Horrible! I will never come back, for sure."}
{"text":"Location and the decor are great.   Food is kinda meh, I would probably only go here again if I wanted a proper sit down dining in the area otherwise I'd probably opt for Burrito Boyz.   I would say it's better then the tourist trap restaurants only King W but that's not saying much.   I had a soup which was luke warm, not very memorable and sandwich which was ok.   Kinda offtopic but the Bell lightbox building itself, I've been advised you can access some interesting areas unfortunately I haven't tried it, for example the outside stadium seating area, great views of the city, the rooftop, some other odd floors, will have to work up the nerve to explore in the future."}
{"text":"Having been to O&B Café Grill, I was a bit disappointed by Canteen. It felt very casual - which would have been fine - though the prices felt on par with some nicer, more upscale O&B eateries. I had the artichoke and cheese sandwich with a side tomato salad, and everything came out to $20. I would have expected to pay slightly less given that this is a place that doesn't take reservations, smells quite strongly of oil, and employs a gruffer, less trained staff than the other O&B eateries.  Overall, food was good. Service alright - had to wait quite awhile to order and then for food. Atmosphere was a bit too casual for the price and type of food as well. Would say that there are better places to go to get bang for your buck."}
{"text":"The manager got back to me and I got a $50 gift card for my past disappointing experience. This time things were somewhat better. I ordered a seafood spaghettini which was ok but not that great. My wife ordered a margherita pizza which was also ok at best. We ordered a bottle of wine for $40 which was also ok. The service was excellent.  The price point of this restaurant makes absolutely no sense. You can get a bottle of wine at The KEG for $22 and entrees for few bucks more. O&B Canteen is a glorified cafeteria with pricey food and wine and quality is ok at best. I'm afraid I will not be coming back. Bill came to $98 and I could have a feast at a classy restaurant for that amount of money."}
{"text":"Been here so many times already, so will make this review succinct-  Food- 5/5 as usual. We ordered the Spicy Octopus Patatas Bravas to start and despite being really, really small, the flavors were phenomenal! Expected nothing less from O&B. The octopus tasted a lot like red meat, which really threw me off. I felt like I was biting into a well-done pork chop both in terms of texture and flavor. The aioli sauce was very creamy, like mayo. There were a few small anchovies in there, very salty but a nice touch if you appreciate seafood. The fried potatoes were great of course, and tasted very much like home-fries from Denny's. The grain bowl tonight was the true disappointment. Small and simplistic, lacking in flavor (especially the tofu) despite tarragon sauce. I added spicy dijon mustard to give it a flavor boost. I liked the grain bowl here from Winterlicious much better.  Value- 2/5. When did portions get so small? Although everything was quite filling (i.e. the grain bowl). Mains are high teens-$30.  Service- 3/5. Super friendly and welcoming as usual, but a bit slow getting food to the table and forgot to bring our beverage until pretty late into the appetizer.  Venue- 5/5. Sidewalk patio is open for business! It's heated they told me, but still was a bit chilly tonight so we ended up sitting inside. One can always count on O&B Canteen for being lively, yet still quiet enough to have an across-table conversation."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch.  Place was packed.  Food was pretty average though.  Definitely nothing to write home.  Also overpriced for what you get.  Waitress seemed uninterested in us.  Overall, not a place that I would recommend in Toronto for brunch unless you were close by."}
{"text":"Me and my girl friends went there in early 2016 and back again in early 2017. Our first time there was a good experience and I would have given it 5/5. I ordered the steak and eggs accompanied with homefries and a green sauce (pesto?) both steak and eggs were cooked as expected and I remember liking the food very much; the meat was tender.  I ordered the same thing one year later. When the food came, I could see the oil floating on the green sauce. The steak was cooked as asked, but the meat was chewy. Both me and my friend got enough of it after having half of it.  Otherwise, washrooms were clean, and service was good.  I would give it 5/5 on my first time and 3/5 on my 2nd time."}
{"text":"My friend said she wanted to go here, but when I checked online and saw the mixed reviews I was skeptical. Nonetheless, I tried to go in with an open mind and I'm definitely glad that I did. We split the tahini and sweet potato fries to start, which were DELICIOUS. Very crispy and well seasoned. For my main  I got the lamb gnocchi which was a good sized portion and incredibly flavourful. The lamb meat was tender and their use of truffle oil truly elevated the dish. The service was decent and the food satisfied. The only negative thing I would say is that my friend who got the raw pad thai dish didn't feel like it was really pad thai and that it was more like zucchini noodles in dressing with peanuts on top, which while tasting fine, was not the traditional pad thai flavour."}
{"text":"Not bad but not amazing. Some nice waring dishes but nothing out of this world. More hit then miss."}
{"text":"Had a drink with a friend here yesterday after work in order to check out the patio.  To be fair, it was only drinks, we didn't try any of their food, and since we only had beer, can't rate them based on that.    Thus, this review is based on their sidewalk patio and service.    Ok, when we first arrived the hostess approached us and went over the menu with us - this after we told her we were only having drinks.  After seh finished her speil (which went on forever), she told us that we would not be \"served\" on the patio, and that once we decided on what we wanted we would have to come back inside and place our order...which seemed totally odd (perhaps we misunderstood or just tuned her out 3 minutes into her menu monologue).    Anyway, once we sat down on the patio, a server appeared immediately and took our drink order.  He was really nice.  Brought us our drinks and checked on us a couple of times.  We ordered another round and were enjoying the patio.    When we were ready to leave we asked for our bill, however, he wasn't able to bring it to us given that he was serving other tables, so we walked up to the cash inside and paid our bill before leaving.  The beer was nice and cold, the patio was nice and the service was ok.  Overall, meh.  I'm not sure I want to return a second time to try their menu."}
{"text":"Good spot to grab a bite if you are around the area. Came here for brunch on the weekend and liked the open concept of the restaurant. Service was fast and my beet salad tasted pretty fresh. The portion of the egg Benedict was on the smaller but I liked how the hollandaise sauce was light and not too overpowering."}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot but thought it was wayyyy overpriced. I got the Bianca pizza and the mushroom tastes were soooo good, downside though was the crust, way too chewy and tough. I love their beer selection and the service was great."}
{"text":"Thanksgiving dinner was tasty.   What there was of it.  More stuffing please.  A side salad please.  There was no bread or beverage included in the $22.  The service was good though."}
{"text":"Great Quoina spinach salad and incredible service.  Must do with TIFF movie."}
{"text":"Came here on Thursday with two others. Pleasant service, lovely atmosphere, especially at the outdoor patio.  Ordered the spicy carrot and kale salad, which was kind of hard to chew (and we only discovered the greek yogurt on the bottom at the very end).   Must try the butter chicken pizza - really savory and the mango adds a sweet twang! The knucklehead sandwich was alright, but had better ones with more BBQ flavor. didn't like the mustard and really sour sauerkraut topping.  Bottom line: Great for a dinner & movie date. Not-so-conventional menu that's a hit-or-miss."}
{"text":"Great addition and just great with the Tiff experience. Friendly staff and servers! Great food. All day breakfast is heaven! People watching? Can't be beat  Five bucks for a 20oz mill street beer is cool as well   Menu is varied enough to satisfy most palates"}
{"text":"Restaurant had a good vibe and service was great.  Calamari tacos, jerk chicken plate, and grilled salmon plate was our order between 2 people.  I would recommend the calamari tacos. The plates felt a little bit on the bland side, but it was a really good portion."}
{"text":"Arrived in Toronto and stayed nearby King Street and starved and looking for casual place. Could not be more happy to find Canteen.  My waiter suggested the Ossa Bucca and couldnotbe more pleased. Came out quick and it's very good. Ordered a Malbec glass and perfect with the dish. Casual, good, clean, close to hotel, reasonable. Place had it all!"}
{"text":"We went here twice on our visit during the last weekend in August. The first visit merits about 1.5 stars, since we had to wait almost 2 hours for our brunch on Sunday, 8/29/10. We were about to cancel our order and head elsewhere because it was just not happening. NO ONE had food. We were wondering if there was a sudden chef strike. However, a manager suddenly appeared with a dish of tea bread, carrot cake and muffins, and apologized for the wait and thanked us for our patience. Since it was after 1pm and we hadn't eaten that day, the food was gladly accepted. I loved the cherry cinnamon muffins.  A little while longer went by and our server came over to apologize again and to tell us that our bill was on the house. Awesome! I estimate the cost to have been well over $60 with tip. Here's what we ate:  The rhubarb-ricotta compote spread over toast is very good and there are some edible flower petals. Cute touch. The BF had OJ and I had both the ice tea (a nice rooibus) as well as hot jasmine green tea. BF had a croissant sandwich that he didn't like. It seems it was missing the Canadian bacon, and the melted cheese was cold, but since it arrived on the free side of the waiting, he didn't send it back. My meal was much more palatable. Pulled pork eggs benedict! Yum. Too heavy on the hollandaise sauce; I scraped 75% of it off my plate. Since the BF didn't have too much of a brunch, I shared.  Since there's a grab & go section, we stopped by the next morning before our drive back to Boston. You can order your food at the counter and take off or eat it at the tall communal table. We got a fruit cup, which is doused in a refreshing lemongrass-mint syrup, two blueberry muffins, a cheese scone, and a cheese-custard gateau tart. Good food and I'm glad we came back.  Also noted -- it seemed like there were several chefs being trained along the left wall on that Monday morning. Perhaps they had to replace their kitchen staff. However, I think that Canteen will be tremendous when it hits it's stride. The focus seems to be on locally sourced food prepared creatively, and the results (mostly) are delicious."}
{"text":"Visited this place on Easter Sunday so it was a lot quieter than usual. We had steak frites, lamb kabob with quinoa, pulled pork burger with sweet potato soup. The menu options are OK, they try to make it fusion but the combinations are not that appetizing. For example jerk chicken with Chinese fried rice? Feels like left overs.... Food ia OK but definitely over priced. Nothing out of the ordinary"}
{"text":"This place did not wow me. Menu wise nothing really looked great. We came with a group so I didnt really choose to come here.   I will say the place is really freaking cool though. All the waitresses have mad gab shirts. They were super nice and friendly.    Unfortunately my review is just based on the menu and food. I ordered the canteen breakfast. It was ok. Nothing to rave about. Nothing to come back for. Everyone else's food didn't look better. Small portions. Which would be fine if the prices matched.    Overall: good service, great location, meh food."}
{"text":"Very nice place ! We tested it 3 consecutive evenings. Consistent friendly and efficient service ! Original and good food."}
{"text":"I always enjoyed going to Oliver & Bonacini restaurants but after trying O&B Canteen, I must say this is my least fave.  Went to try their Summerlicious lunch and I wasn't impressed by their food offering. We tried the 'Licious Burger and Salmon with Orzo and it was just 'meh'. You won't even be blown away by the food presentation you normally see in other O&B resto.  For dessert, we ordered the Strawberry Cream Donut and Poached Peach Vanilla Ice Cream and it just tasted like an ordinary dessert that you can buy anywhere.  Maybe will give this restaurant another try and order their normal menu just to give them another chance."}
{"text":"Love their menu - simple choices but with great flavours!  Have tried their mussels, pulled pork sandwich and mac n' cheese - they were all very delicious.  Service is every attentive and non-pretentious.  If you like cocktails, their award-winning Canteen Derby is a must (made with Pims, Ginger Lemonade, Ginger Ale, and cucumbers) - very refreshing!"}
{"text":"The patio is great - comfortable and great for people watching and the food is pretty good too. I have been there three times now (twice on the patio and once inside) and have had terrible customer service on two out of three visits. Tonight, again really poor service. After being sat on the patio, we were ignored for about fifteen minutes until I went inside to find someone to take our order. I didn't mind, but if you are in a rush, or someone who gets bothered by poor service, this isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  Wanting to get a bite to eat and just chill with my girlfriends, we ended up here at the TIFF light box restaurant.  It was about half full and looked like a good place to eat and talk.  The service is really friendly and the menu is pretty decent (we went for a late dinner).  Not being too hungry we ordered for the table:  Lamb meatballs Caesar salad Catfish with vermicelli noodles  The lamb meatballs (which is an app) were delicious and spicy and pretty flavorful!  Eggplant, tomato and mint in the sauce gave it a lovely depth of flavor. We all loved these and would definitely order them again.  They came with naan bread (cut up) to soak up the lovely sauce.  If you weren't that hungry and just wanted a nibble I would get these again.  The Caesar salad that my friend picked was ok (Hines how could you screw up salad) but they had HUGE pieces of croutons in them.  Kinda weird  I chose the catfish with the noodles, it has a turmeric and dill marinade and was light and refreshing.  I would have preferred it with rice instead of the noodles as I felt the noodles were bland.  The portion size was a bit small as well.  The dinner menu has a good selection of things to try - apps, pizza, noodles, sandwiches- so something for everyone.  An overall good choice if you are in the area but don't expect outstanding (except for the lamb - it was pretty good)."}
{"text":"This place is great, especially because their menu is gluten-free friendly and they have delicious GF bread. Great waitress the first time we went, waiter second time was OK. I enjoyed their breakfast/brunch menu, although my canteen breakfast came with just one piece of toast."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I had a terrible experience here.  I was really looking forward to this place as it was an O&B establishment.  Soup of the day was yoghurt and dill. Gross. I honestly dont know how that was passed as \"servable\" to customers.   Also had the grilled cheese and the burger. Both items seemed as if they've been pre-made and just re-heated. The grilled cheese was extremely crunchy, and the cheese wasn't even melted.  The burger on the other hand was extremely dry and the dry bun didn't help either. Wish it had more aioli on it!  I was even excited for the tartar! But even that was a little odd with the honey dijon and the mini ketchup chips. The taste could have been manageable, but the tartar was so chunky that it took a minute to chew each mouthful.   Really disappointed."}
{"text":"Liked:  - gnocchi was quite good, soft, and flavourful, with big pieces of lamb meat on it - chickpea fritter was really good-  kinda like a fallafel but more moist  The service here was standard - nothing out of the ordinary. The prices are a bit high for a lunch place but it is reasonable. One of the better restaurants on King st for lunch."}
{"text":"Canteen is a thoroughly middle of the road restaurant. The food isn't bad, but it's also not particularly good. I was expecting more from an O&B joint. Prices are reasonable, which was a nice surprise. The interior is also quite nice. It's probably a better place to meet for drinks and appetizers than to meet for dinner proper.  They do look to serve a slew of sandwiches, so I will need to go back to see how the place fares as a lunch joint."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews, I was a little apprehensive to write my rather happy opinion of this place.  Any place that offers all day breakfast automatically gets at least one star. The thought that breakfast at some other places shuts down before 2pm is just plain old, uncalled for in my books.  If you have not tried their fresh squeezed peach juice - it is heaven in a glass. Unfreaking believable!  I can still taste it. As for the other beverage I tried, their house coffee, it was alright.  I can say it was not a stand out but for a regular brew it was worth a refill.  I tried their gnocchi with Ontario lamb.  The rosemary in the dish really made it sing.  The only criticism I have is, they could have developed the richness of the flavour a bit more. Just needed a bit more depth and I would say, as an original concept the follow through was almost perfect.  Would I go here again? Absolutely!  The expanse of the space, the design of the patio and the customer service was excellent.    I have noticed the complaints about pricing and to a certain extent I do agree. However, if you treat this place as an indulgence then you may rest easier on the pricing."}
{"text":"It's a big spot with a million chairs, inside and out on the patio. It was alright, nothing to brag about. My fresh squeezed orange juice was good, but it was $5.50 for like 250 ml. The food was alright, but the potatoes, bacon and sausage all appeared to be deep fried. It's clearly designed to pump out a lot of food, fast."}
{"text":"Was in Toronto for the long weekend, and before our flight we decided to have a Thanksgiving dinner.  Canteen was busy enough for a holiday and we decided to have dinner there.  They had a Thanksgiving special which was very good.  The stuffing was very good, and I do not usually like stuffing.  The stuffing can also be enjoyed with the chicken dish.  Overall, the food was good.  The dessert was eh.  I had the toffee apple cobbler and it tasted like it was burned.  The brownie was also a little burned tasting.    But the real reason for the mediocre rating was the service.  It was pretty bad.  We got what we asked relatively quickly when the waiter popped around, which was not often enough.  This is interesting too because the design of the restaurant doesn't allow of the wait staff to wander off where the patrons can't see them.  Its an open style kitchen and all the service areas are right in plain view.  Our waiter was always all the way across the restaurant, back turned to the patrons, and joking with his coworkers in big gaggles.  It was incredibly unprofessional.  Worst was the manager and host were right in the middle of the circle of non-working staff.    I watched the cook put up our salads to be served and our waiter didn't stop to see what was ready for at least 10 minutes.  When he did wander by them, he looked at them, stared a moment and kept walking.  Only when I darted my eyes at him and the salads did he turn around and realize they were ours.  This was annoying because our dinners were out while we were still finishing our salads.  That's just a pet peeve of mine.    Lastly, we wanted dessert to top of the Canadian Thanksgiving (for us silly Americans traveling on a holiday weekend), so we told him when he took our dinner plates.  He didn't come back for close to 10 minutes to take the orders.  What was he doing while we waited?  Chatting in a big circle with his co-workers.  I felt bad for the kitchen staff because they were obviously working hard and making nice meals and the wait staff was not pulling their weight.  There was one waiter who was running around like a busy guy, but there were 4 or 5 more that weren't.    Too bad because the place is nice and in a great location.  Someone put a lot of thought into the place and the wait staff is going to ruin it if they keep up the way they acted today (and the way other reviewers advised). If you were thinking about getting a bit of dinner before a show at one of the theaters in the neighborhood, I wouldn't risk missing curtain call."}
{"text":"Great roast dinner for $21 on Sunday night. Included delicious mashed potatoes and glazed carrots. We sat outside but when the wind picked up, they were nice about letting us pick up and move inside. We also had a crab dip with pita appetizer that is absolutely cheesy and tasty."}
{"text":"Decent. The place is well situated at the TIFF lightbox building.  Very accessible by subway and close to other interesting restaurants, cafes, and pubs.  The interior is modern and is designed really well.  The staff was professional. The service was excellent.  The price points were acceptable for what you get. Great menu at good prices.   The food was where it didn't make as much sense. It tasted uninspiring.  Decent in a place where just decent shouldn't cut it."}
{"text":"My experience has been utterly different from those of many other Yelp reviewers.  Reviewers adore this place or they hate it.  I am in the mad fanatic head over heels in love triple thumbs up division.  The people who hate the Canteen order standard \"you can get this anywhere dishes\".  Routine brunch. Hamburgers.   All indications are that plain old staples aren't very good here.  So, in the light of that warning, what is knock your socks off rock your socks off die and go to heaven good?  Basically,  most of the exotic things on the menu.   Go strange here playing to the house cook being playful and you can eat at O and B Canteen like a king.  One thumbs up is for the house custom drinks. The Canuck - a rye, maple syrup and beer concoction with bitters and other goodies - is one of the best cocktails I have had ANYWHERE.  And under the eternal law of culinary moral justice - there is no reason for any drink using maple syrup as an ingredient to be even remotely acceptable.  I could drink Canucks all day and all night and be happy forever.  Their Calamari and Jalapeno taco is arguably the finest fish or seafood taco I have had anywhere. Fish tacos are comfort food and in Texas where I come from - it tends to be filling fish with a creamy sauce and some veggie garnishes.  Fried Calamari is more interesting than fish in a taco.  Straight up naked jalapenos give plenty of heat but are still light and refreshing.  Mango buttermilk crema for the sauce? Sign me up forever!  The basic tortilla is not even remotely Mexican and that is the charm. It is earthier and wheatier which is what the inner contents need. A first rate dish top to bottom.  They also do a watermelon salad with jalapeno, radish and mint with an avocado crema. Yes this is a winner, and no this is not because I am any fan of raw jalapeno.  (Raw jalapenos are an abomination served with Vietnamese pho - which doesn't stop the Vietnamese from doing that all the time).  Here the jalapeno and watermelon play like they were meant to be companions for life - and radish allows you to take a break before going back to the main duet.  But the super-star dish not to be missed is the cryptically titled dessert \"Three Squares\"  Which three squares you get depend on what the cook feels like cooking today.  The three squares I got were two legendary desserts and a darn fine homemade 'fig newton\".  Legendary dessert one was a tough as nails chocolate torte with a mango cream filling.   An object lesson in the eternal rule that chocolate is nearly always better when mixed with something else (mint, coffee, raspberry, orange ... or in this case mango). The top of the chocolate was almost like a chocolate bar - and was firm enough to require real effort to cut it. This was meant to balance the cream in the middle and was a great contrast.  Dessert orgasm on the first bite.  Strangely, this was the SECOND most impressive of the three desserts.  The champion was a peanut butter square.   You know the drill right? Peanut butter whatever for dessert ....  Bo - ring.  Peanut butter cookies can be pleasant although they generally need chocolate to help.  This was pure peanut butter in two layers of different consistencies and chunkiness with a cream in the middle.  An overpowering peanut taste not heavy and cloggy like peanut butter but light like real peanuts but creamy.  Peanut butter apotheosized into a light creamy wonder.  And that's when I knew I had discovered something higher and finer.  The back-up band was a date bar. Unlike these other tart or creamy wonders, this was solid and wholesome the way health restaurant desserts can be.  It was made with dates but yes it tasted like a fig newton.  I love fig newtons. This was not a problem.   So from the other yelpers you now know -  don't come here for breakfast.  don't come here for plain Canadian stuff.  Put your weird on and explore the new dishes that the cooks have concocted out of their perverted imaginations.  Haute cuisine food without haute cuisine prices."}
{"text":"Canteen, I wanna like you!   Here's the deal - the food is good, nothing spectacular though. I found the portions to be a little small, but there were some imaginative dishes for the lunchtime crowd (ie gnocchi with ontario lamb).   The restaurant itself is really cute and has a modern diner feel. Waitresses were all wearing pink plaid shirts that kind of looked like they were from american eagle. Weird.   I like the concept but there is something that just seems off about this place. Canteen is just ok in my books."}
{"text":"A year has passed since I came here last, I'm back to visit my sister for the holidays! In my last review, I mentioned how everything was over seasoned but it looks like the food has improved. I came with my whole family and everyone was happy with their food, my parents loved their prawn curry, in fact they plan on coming back to eat it again. I'm staying at the condo next door and I'll probably be back for breakfast, their croissant is really nice and flaky."}
{"text":"Lunch today and we each had their cheese burger (canteen burger) and fries.  Quality was good and their mayo tasted like it had yogurt in it.  Bun was pretty good, ever so slightly stale.  Fries were good (not great) and they provide a spicy type of almost salsa instead of ketchup.  Service was good.  $50+ for 2 burgers, one coke and one coffee.  You're paying for the little twists in flavour and location.  I would rate this higher but not really seeing the value for the money.  It's expensive."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere at Canteen. It's in between casual and upscale. The menu is great. Lots of variety and everything tastes fresh. Really enjoy the view of King st through the window. I always try to ask for a seat by the windows :)"}
{"text":"Never really got to try their food unfortunately. I had my worst experience being seated by the rudest host I've ever encountered. My friends and I requested for a table of 3 and were told there was a 15 minutes wait. We suggested to wait at the communal table, while waiting for a table in the patio to free up, just trying to make it work because we really wanted to try this restaurant. Unfortunately, the host, in the rudest and snarkiest possible way just replied with a \"NO\". I was very surprised by the host and left. Definitely will not be making my way there, ever."}
{"text":"Our table of 5 were all first timers and the consensus was positive.   Our drink order was:   House made Sangrias, mimosa and a couple beers. No complaints here!  Here's what we ordered:   Boulibase (good), raw pad Thai (not good at all...it was a super large order of coleslaw), butter chicken pizza (delicious), Canteen burger (super good) and gnocchi with braised lamb (tasty but not the best gnocchi we've had...not sure but it may have been prepackaged).  We indulged in desert:  Carrot cake (table favorite and large enough to share!) and the banana bread pudding (this was NOT GOOD AT ALL! It was basically chunks if banana bread sitting in a puddle of melted ice cream. Defiantly not at all anything close to resembling bread pudding)  I will be back to try a few more menu items. The atmosphere was good."}
{"text":"We had reservations for dinner at 6pm on a Friday. I was seeing a 7pm show at tiff and hubby and niece were seeing a show at nearby Royal Alexander theatre. We parked underground at Princess of Wales theatre ($20 minus $4 since we are Mirvish subscribers). There are lots of parking lots close by but that is my preferred lot. As I arrived, I was freezing....literally shaking from the cold even though I had a shirt, sweater and coat on. They had reserved a window table for us but I requested a change since I was so cold. Unfortunately the only other available table was also beside a window. The host assured me it wouldn't be cold there and he brought me a boiling hot mug of water with lemon to warm me up. I ordered quickly as I didn't want to miss any of the movie and service was very quick. Hubby and niece took a more leisurely pace. I had their mushroom soup, which has been a favourite of mine for years....no dairy in it. I had gf toast on the side. Niece started with avocado toast and then Mac and cheese. She couldn't finish either so packed the Mac and cheese to go. Hubby had mushroom soup and jerk chicken. He also couldn't finish and had his chicken packed. The restaurant has a couple of washrooms inside but there are many more on the second floor of the Tiff building. They do not offer a discount to Tiff members or Mirvish subscribers, which is odd due to their proximity to both. Disappointing actual  Great new menu with tons of gf and veg options. The ginger lemonade was tart but nice and I requested the mango chia pudding from the counter, which I love!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with O&B Canteen since my first visit on early September. I love the food, the ambience and also the services. There is nothing that I'd complain about this venue. For the food, I love love love its watermelon salad and prawn curry. It's so yummy! I don't really like its carrot cake because it's too sweet, meanwhile my friend ordered brownies and it was burned. As conclusion, I recommended you to have starter and main course here but just forget about the desert, ain't da best. Otherwise you gotta try and check it out!"}
{"text":"To my disappointment, I was very underwhelmed by Canteen. It's a lovely space but that's all I can really say about my experience there on Wednesday evening. Our server seemed a bit clueless and service overall was just ok.   My group ordered a few appetizers which were good but overpriced. For my main, I ordered the pork chop with \"roasted celeriac & purée, almond pistou\" for $23. The portion was ridiculously small -- the chop was 3oz at most, and the small pile of cubed carrots and celeriac was boring (and not at all what I expected). The server described the chop as being really tasty in a lovely sauce, so I was surprised to see a plain, dry chop appear on my plate, which as it turned out was tasteless. Absolutely nothing special about this dish and my two friends who ordered the same agreed."}
{"text":"Love it for weekend brunches!  I love this place especially for weekend brunches, ironically I never got anything from the weekend brunch menu.   Food - Love it all. From pizza, to salads, to desert, to appetizers. Pricey, but it is worth every cent. It is so delicious and the atmosphere is great.  Great to eat alone, with friend/s or a loved one. Make it a date and enjoy it even more :)  Drink - I love their cider and lemonades. Coffee is allright. I feel that the freshly squeezed juices are overpriced."}
{"text":"Normally I really love this place. Decided to take a chance on the jerk chicken. It was extremely disappointing and tasted more like a lime herb chicken. The menu listed this dish as having harbanero but it was the least bit spicy. I had to ask For some hot sauce and the server brought some Asian style hot sauce. The rice and peas was really bad too."}
{"text":"3.7 Stars out of 5  What I LIKED!  -Very casual, servers were very attentive and great portion size -Starters I had the Grilled Beef Short Ribs /w glass noodles, 8 out of 10  -Pizza, I had the Olives & Bocconcini, I didn't really like the toppings and was spicy to me. 5 out of 10, but my friend thought it was okay -Main, East Coast Boil, it was okay, I had better mussel seafood dish in the past. Wasn't too crazy about it. 6 Out of 10 -Dessert, This was the BEST part! Had the Chocolate Eton Mess. Wasn't too sweet and it had a crunch to it.   Menu wise I wish there was more variety and instead of the server telling me \"I have tried everything and everything is good\" I wish he narrowed down the best dishes at Canteen.   FINAL VERDICT  The bill came out to be about $50 for two people and we were both stuffed. It wasn't a negative experience nor was it too crazy. I would come back for a light dinner and drinks, but perhaps not for dinner."}
{"text":"Canteen is right next to where I work and I find myself coming here on my lunch breaks all the time.  The menu is good, it has a variety of dishes to choose from. It's not AMAZING, but good enough to always get me to come back.  The patio is really nice in the summer, especially for people watching. It's located in one of the best areas in Toronto so that's a huge plus. I recommend the forbidden rice bowl - it's my fav thing on the menu!  I'd give the food 7.5/10 Service is always great - 8.5/10 Location: 9.5/10"}
{"text":"I had the Steak Frits which was cooked very well, my friend had the dally special \"Penne in Rose with Kale & walnuts\" and she says it's to die for. This morning we came back for breakfast, today's fresh juice was peach, and I have to say it's the best of ever had. Eggs on toast was heaven !!!! The salads are all good you can't decide easily, the Caesar with Kale  Bottom line if you want good fresh cooked food come here"}
{"text":"I stopped in to get something quick to take back to my hotel - the person working there was so nice and helpful.  The food was amazing - ordered the untitled pizza - wish I would have discovered this place the first night in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Oliver and Bonacini can do better.  We stopped in for a quick lunch on the weekend and the the food was marginal, especially considering the price.  Two salads and 1/2 pint of beer cost nearly $50, which I wouldn't mind paying if the salads were top notch, but 50 cents worth of romaine lettuce and an over-done piece of chicken breast does not an amazing salad make..."}
{"text":"Nice go to place for a bite before a movie at TIFF or catching a musical nearby and having a chat with a couple of friends.  On this particular occasion I had a Jerk Chicken prior to watching an animated painting movie about Vincent van Gogh. The chicken was a bit dry, had a good taste and spicy. Followed by few glasses of water.  It was quiet that evening and seating was not difficult to find. O & B is part of more than a dozen of the Oliver Bonacini restaurants in the Toronto area."}
{"text":"Popped by Canteen earlier this week before seeing \"Once\" at the Royal Alexandra. It's worth noting that they do not take reservations for small parties (of less than 6.) We came by around 6pm and the wait time for a party of 4 was approximately 20 minutes. However, since this was an approximate wait time, and not a perfect science, it ended up being about twice that amount of time. Good news is, the staff working there are super accommodating. They asked us what time our show was, and said they would do whatever it takes to make sure we were seated, happy and well fed, and out in time for our show. Lucky for us, this was the truth!  The food here is AMAZING, and extremely well-priced for the location. It came out SUPER fast after we ordered since they knew we were on a time constraint. Here's some of what we sampled:  Chicken Soup - yummy flavours and perfect for a cold evening. BBQ Spiced Fries - LOVED these! The BBQ spice with the steaming hot fries and ranch dressing is addictive and a nice play on what can be a boring side dish. Gnocci with braised lamb - the gnocci was perfectly cooked - nice and soft and moist. The lamb was extremely tender and delicious. Maple Glazed Salmon - again, cooked to perfection. The glaze was amazing. Peach Juice - sooooo fresh and more of a smoothie/puree consistency.  The staff are super friendly and sweet. They also wear shirts with Mad Gab-like puzzles on the back, so trying to figure out what their shirts say in the amount of time when they have their back to you adds some fun to the evening, :).  Our experience here totally blew away all of our expectations. Will definitely back my way back here next time I'm in the area for a show!"}
{"text":"I have really tried to like this place but I just can't. I've been there three times and tonight was the last. The food is just plain awful. The first time I had a bland sandwich which had probably been sitting in a fridge all day. Next time I had the butter chicken pizza. I was 90% just bread, and the toppings were tasteless. Tonight I had quinoa chicken salad. It was gross soggy mess. Frankly I feel sick now. The staff is wonderful but that is its only redeeming quality. For the life of me I can't see what all the fuss is about. Never again."}
{"text":"The food tasted good, ordered the short rib, but the prices were high and the portions were very small. Left the restaurant still hungry. Don't think I will be going back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were there for their Sunday Night Roast Beef dinner this evening and oh wow...was it every yummy! His was cooked medium as requested and mine , medium well and the roasted brussel sprouts and baby carrots made perfect sides to the beef. The presentation was great and the taste ,delectable. We were totally impressed and will be back to try their other dishes. I had called them an hour earlier wondering if they would have the roast beef dinner available for the time we were there and the manager was really sweet to make sure enough was saved for us..Our server too was pleasant ..We have tried roast beef dinners at a few other restaurants in town but O & B Canteen is where you will find the perfect one!"}
{"text":"Modern, classy and spacious, great corner location for lots of light.  A good meeting place or social gathering.  Private room available on the left of the doors.  Picked up a cheese rosemary scone with coffee, passable.  Wide selection on their menu, pizzas, sandwiches and breakfast.    Friendly service."}
{"text":"Simple menu. Local ingredients. Attention to detail. Casual charm. Canteen.O&B's newest restaurant with a home in the TIFF Bell Lightbox.  Defying the notion that simple fare can't be done well, Canteen's menu is centered around familiar, comfort foods. Pasta (gnocchi, tagliatelle), pizza (calabrese, al parma), pressed sandwiches (chicken BLT, prosciutto), steak frites, mussels etc. with a weekly chef's menu that changes based on seasonality.  A feast for the eyes, and our first indication of Chef Jason Bangerter's influence. Second indication? Housemade ketchup. Seriously, try with the handcut fries...addicting. Third indication? Edible flowers. Try the Soma brownie. Could keep going, but he really does have his hand in everything. A little touch here and there...exceeding your expectations for casual dining.  Stand-outs so far: the salads (thai coleslaw, beet root, israeli couscous), chicken liver parfait and desserts (soma brownie, lemon posset)."}
{"text":"Try their 'large' kale salad. Just try it. It's the size of a small cereal bowl. It was OK tasting, but what a disappointment. $9 price was more than double what it should have been. Want a Cobb salad? This is the worst excuse for a $14 salad ever. It's literally a wedge of lettuce with 'grilled' chicken that looked like it came out of a can. It was bland, flavourless and again, a disappointment. 4 of us got salads. Not one of us left satisfied. Not one of us will return. All of us will tell others about this terrible meal. As many others have said, avoid this overpriced disaster of an excuse to be visited because of the O&B name attached.  Oh, and then after asking for the bill (twice) it took another 10 minutes and another reminder to finally get it and get out of there.  Not worth one star!"}
{"text":"The place itself is in a good location and has some decent menu choices. The interior is cafeteria chic, open airy and bright.  The staff however is very average. 5 minutes to be greeted when not even very busy. 5 more to even have a waiter come by. Then I ordered a coffee with milk and no milk came. Quite frankly very disappointed. I choose to leave after coffee without ordering food. This is the second time this place has been at best average.   There are way better options."}
{"text":"If salt is your thing, you will love O & B Canteen.  This was our third visit and probably our last.  The short rib ravioli was inedible due to its saltiness.  So was the macaroni and cheese that my husband had.   Parmesan fries?  Guess what ... laced with salt. Believe me, I am a fan of seasoning when it enhances the flavour of the food but, in the case of Canteen, it overpowers the meal.   The pickings are slim along King West so it's especially disappointing that a restaurant with the O & B branding behind it isn't better."}
{"text":"Dropped by last Sunday before watching Naked Lunch (a film you gotta see on a full stomach, AMIRITE FELLOWS?!)  for dinner with the wife.   I participated in the Eat Like a Chef menu item, which is a rotating dish on Sundays.  This weekend it consisted of spare ribs, collard greens and a piece of cornbread to die for. The Cesar is also tasty.    I do like the place, and enjoy eating there, but it just seems a bit pricey."}
{"text":"Stopped by after seeing a screening that was part of CineFranco. It was ~9pm, so by then the dinner rush was mostly over. I came in a party of 3 and we just had to wait 5 minutes for a table (yes, for once when the hostess said \"5 minutes\" it actually was 5 minutes!). I have been here once before, also for dinner.   We were starving, so we ordered the artisan bread basket right away while we pondered the menu and yummy-sounding specials (there was a soup, pasta, and pizza of the day, plus a burger special but by then they were sold out of it). The bread was just okay... Not warm or as soft as I usually like it. It came with hummus and a dish of mixed olives.   I ended up trying the mac and cheese with ham, which was rich, creamy, and filling. The noodles were shells, not actually macaroni. Instead of bread crumbs, the dish was topped with very finely crushed pistachios - interesting! One DC also had the same thing and agreed that it was amazing! My other DC went for the French onion soup to compliment the French film we just saw. It looked good!   I like the minimalist decor and the service was attentive. Our server did separate bills without a problem and wasn't pushy (some of the O&B servers are really pushy trying to get you to try the Q filtered water, which costs extra). The last time I came here, I was early meeting a friend and they gave me the latest Vogue to flip through while I waited, which was nice of them.    If you're in a rush there is also a grab and go section.   Fantastic place for cinephiles to recharge between film screenings!"}
{"text":"I ate here on Friday and was very impressed! We had a very friendly server who gave us lots of information on the specials and thoroughly answered our questions about the menu. We shared the grain bowl and a pizza and both were great. The grain bowl was very unique, great flavour/dressing and a good mix of veggies and grains with grilled tofu, and a good sized portion. The thin-crust pizza (we had margherita) was very good considering this isn't a pizza-specific restaurant. Will definitely come back here if I'm in the area. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Agree with the previous reviews. My wingman and I stopped by this place it did not disappoint. Service was efficient, the cuisine was as advertised and I appreciated the loft like mix of airspace, brick and concrete.   Very unpretentious restaurant with reasonable pricing for reasonable cuisine. While I can sympathize with Maxine, I enjoyed the quinoa salad and everything went together quite well. Good variety of textures, fresh vegetables and perhaps a tad too much dressing. All in all a very good meal!"}
{"text":"Although portions were small (noted on other reviews), the main point is that the food was below avg. I've had diner breakfasts all over TO & this was waaaay below even these. For $18, both the potatoes & sausage just tasted like pure fat. Nothing else. I am surprised that the high standards of Messers O&B are compromised to such a degree - do either of these chefs frequent their own restos ?? And not being a tourist, do these owners even care about repeat customers & loyal local clientele ? Avoid at all costs"}
{"text":"Crazy expensive for such a mediocre place! You can do way better going literally anywhere else."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Canteen! I've been to the restaurant on three different occasions and have had a pleasant experience each time. I find Canteen is a place where you can meet up with your closest friends and catch up. The environment is a bit loud and filled with theatre goers, but overall, it is warm, inviting and interesting. Also, when I say loud, I mean that when a firetruck or ambulance drives by, it basically echos throughout the entire dining room.  Each time I've been at Canteen, I've order a sandwich with an accompanying side of fries. The sandwiches are amazing, and the dipping sauce for the fries is absolutely delicious. I swear, I continually try to make the dipping sauce at home, but to no avail.   On one occasion, I also had their Boston Cream Cake for dessert which was delicious, but I felt it was a bit try. If they added more 'cream' to the cake, I feel it could have been moist and tastier.  Overall, Canteen is a great place, servers are fast and efficient and I will surely be back again in the future!"}
{"text":"While the service was very friendly, the food simply didn't live up to the O&B brand. The untitled pizza was passable, but needed a lot of help from red chili flakes in order to make interesting. Sparse with chicken and even less shrimp, nothing really stood out and could easily have been something sold at Pizza Nova. The dessert was laughable. $6 for a cheesecake the size of a postage stamp, even our server apologized as she lowered the small square in front of me. Sure it tasted fine, but how do you mess up cheesecake? My friend got the panna cotta, which I would recommend instead. The honeyed strawberries were refreshing, the panna cotta was generously sized, creamy and had a nice hint of citrus. Perfect for the summer.  And one final thing. If you really want to look and sound like a bozo, try and read the backs of the servers shirts. Hilarious."}
{"text":"Despite my luke-warm review of the upstairs sister Luma at the Bell TiFF Lightbox, I am a big fan of the O & B Canteen.   I've been there for drinks and dinner on a couple of occasions. Reservations recommended as they are a busy post-work downtown core staple and they are always busy.   Hands down, one of the best martinis I've had in the city - tasted on two different occasions :-) My version is an extra dirty martini with no vermouth. Delicious!!!  The food is good - upscale pub type food with delicious pizzas, pasta and salads. They allowed me to vegetarian-ize a pizza off the menu and even add another item with no qualms and it was delicious. They also have day of the week specials and items you can order premade if you only have time to stop and grab something on the run.  Perfect place to share a couple of plates with a friend or for a first or second date spot. Friendly, (and quite attractive) young wait staff and pleasant all around experience."}
{"text":"I have tried really hard to love Canteen because it is in such a convenient location for me.  However, the service is pretty slow and I have not hit any home runs with the food. Last night I ordered a roasted carrot salad with grilled chicken on top.  The salad was so small it could not fill a tea cup, and the chicken was dry.  The salad tasted good, though it was done in about two bites.  The worst part was it cost $17 dollars for this salad.  I wish I took a picture to share, but I forgot in the moment. Other times I have had the omelet, pizza, steak frites and scallops. Omelet, pizza and steak frites are nothing special.  The scallops are tasty but again, the servings are super tiny. Overall I would  not recommend this place if you have a chance to walk further to go somewhere else, you should.  I am sure I will come back when I really need something and convenience is my only factor."}
{"text":"We stopped in at O & B Canteen  yesterday.  It opened about a week ago in the the soon-to-open Bell Lightbox (the new King West epicentre of TIFF).  As a snack, Gord ordered the Beef Brisket sandwich (croissant, havarti, sauerkraut).  I order the Chicken BLT (pain au lait, lemon mayonnaise) minus lettuce.  They were okay, not great.   The service was slow and unorganized ... probably because they are so new.  The patio was a great place for people watching, especially since there were lots of people walking by dressed up and heading to and from the FanExpo Canada."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here in May 2014 for dinner for my birthday. It was my first time here. They seated us quickly as there were just the two of us (Sat night). The server came quickly as well and we ordered a bottle of wine to start. I didn't  find the server to be all that helpful or friendly in terms of helping us select from their exotic List of menu items. He also encouraged us to order three to four dishes for the two of us and in the end it ended up being a little bit too much food for us.  Given the price point I would've expected the ambience to be a bit nicer inside. For 3 dishes and a bottle of wine the bill came to approximately $130.   They did give us each a wrapped cookie because it was my birthday which was a really sweet and unexpected touch. I had the cookie the next day and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Went to Canteen for a large group gathering after reading some reviews here and not being sure if it was a good idea.   I was very happy with the decision however. Definitely recommend the grilled cheese and the pulled pork. Both were the highlights of everyones meal. Some of the other dishes were less exciting but still good.  Service was fantastic, friendly, and attentive without being annoying! We all decided we would go back."}
{"text":"They changed the menu and got rid of the forbidden rice bowl. Now all the vegetarian options have dairy! Now the veg option is a portobello melt. Boo. Zzzz boring and sad. Still OK for drinks."}
{"text":"3.5-3.8 Stars  VIBE  Canteen has been on my Toronto bucket list for a while, so I was really excited to get here. Plus, there wasn't a line. Bonus! Canteen is haute cafeteria. You can stay or go and someone is always passing you by. Architecture is clean and simple and the booths are mighty comfortable.   Service is extra attentive and smiley. One poor server was so eager to take our plates on top of his unorganized stack that the dishes all came crumbling down. Luckily because of the layout, it wasn't *such* a disaster. I'm sure he disappeared into his staff room and cried (or not...but I would! That's why I'm not a server. I just write about them).   Of course, the location is right central at TIFF's new headquarters, so a place I avoid during TIFF. It's a much needed destination restaurant in the King West area and none of the 20 restaurants across the street really match up to it in terms of the whole package.   The patio is quite lovely as well and if you can snag a seat, a fantastic people watching spot in a bustling area.   Also: I like the fonts on the menu.  Bravo, graphic designer. Bravo!   WE ATE  The menu switches up from time to time. We were lucky that the mac n cheese was new on the menu and it did NOT disappoint! Ooey and gooey, it was the perfect fix for a grey day (at the end of May, mind you). It was filled with a sharp, creamy garganelli cheese, ham and cheddar and crusted on top like a casserole. Mmmm.   I convinced my Dining Companion to get the quesadillas (anyone care to quote Napoleon Dynamite here?). They were pulled pork and plentiful but something was off in the flavour. Just maybe not enough \"fillings\" and mainly the pork was what was throwing me off. The \"guacamole\" that came with it was a creamed high-end mayo version of it which meant it wasn't really guacamole. So no red onion, no lime, no chunkiness at all. Disappointed. The salsa, however, was DELICIOUS. Super fresh and made in house.   Price-wise, our meal was quite affordable and expected for what you're paying for in the King West area.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  No army brats here. Just cineophiles that want a quick meal fix before their next film. A great, stylish addition to King West. Just say yes to mac n cheese and no to the quesadillas."}
{"text":"Is it wrong of me to actually want basil on a pizza that is listed on the menu as having basil as one of its three main ingredients? My margherita pizza had three toppings: tomato, cheese, and a few wisps of some kind of tasteless herb that was most definitely not basil.  I could almost forgive it if it was an interesting, yummy herb, or the rest of the pizza was great, but it cost $2 more than Libretto's Margherita and was nowhere near as tasty. Meh.  Come on, guys. I expect this from Amato pizza, not from an O and B restaurant."}
{"text":"I was excited to come here after hearing some good things but I was severely disappointed.  I ordered the lamb gnocchi and the \"untitled\" pizza and both were not appetizing at all. the lamb gnocchi had zero taste, and after adding round and rounds of salt, it finally felt a little more edible. I should also mention that the gnocchi was completely soggy and it felt like just eating soggy chunks of nothingness. (please refer to the picture I posted)  as for the untitled pizza, it was really nothing special. looked like some flatbread with some cheese, vegetables and chicken just randomly sprinkled on top. when you lift a piece they practically all jus topple off. (please also refer to the picture I posted)  did I also mention that each of these dishes were more than $20? so there goes an expensive and unsatisfying almost 60 dollar lunch."}
{"text":"O&B is conveniently located in the entertainment district. They have a vast variety of tasty foods. One nice thing is that they are constantly updating the menu so you have new options. Their vegetarian Tagine was one of my fives, not sure it still exists,  The beet salad and Salmon are lovely options. Once again not sure they still exist"}
{"text":"O & B is a good place to grab a bite, but I think it's a bit too expensive for what you get and honestly feels just a touch pretentious.  Still, if you're sick of bar food this is a decent alternative. I had a late lunch the other day before a movie and I was able to eat and pay with time to spare.  The chicken BLT is one of the better values on the menu; it's only $6 and will satiate a normal-sized appetite."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the roasted chicken dinner is delicious! The prosciutto was fantastic as well!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I came to Canteen on an early Sunday afternoon (brunch rookie mistake #1), right after the Waterfront marathon and CN tower corporate climb (brunch rookie mistake #2) - so this place was packed. That being said, the wait to be seated was less than 15 minutes (not bad at all). We ordered coffee, which came promptly and was great, and then two basic breakfasts (2 eggs, bacon, home fries). Wait time for breakfast was about 45 minutes. The home fries were awesome, eggs were fine, bacon was terrible. Overall an okay breakfast. I have 4 stars because of the convenience of location, interesting menu (although we went vanilla this time), and cute atmosphere. I'd definitely go back - though never again on a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Pretty pricey. I enjoy their grab and go menu as there is a variety of unique and delicious options, however you are paying a pretty penny to get them."}
{"text":"I had the gnocchi and my friend had the pizza, both were bland and couldn't be saved even with a generous sprinkling of pepper. My gnocchi was tough and not soft and pillowy as they should be. It seems like there is no real effort and love put into the food. Their beer selection is also awful (Grolsch and Mill Street Organic are their only lagers and are not typical winter beers). I ordered a Muskoka Detour IPA and it was served in a hot glass that came straight from the dishwasher. Serving beer in a warm glass is inexcusable and ruins it. My bill for bad gnocci and one bottle of beer was $37. Total waste of money, would not go back."}
{"text":"I would have to give this restaurant an A+ on all fronts! Every dish that I have tried, from pastries to sandwiches to pastas, have all been nothing shy of excellent. The ambiance is wonderful - amazing patio for checking out the scenery and people watching, and an ultra cool laid-back atmosphere on the inside. Meals are reasonably priced and a great go-to spot if you're looking to grab something quick and tasty.   The gnocchi was spectacular, and the lasagna was amazing the last we were there. Portion of gnocchi could have been a bit more generous, but the lasagna was definitely good bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Very convienent if you're planning on watching something at the TIFF lightbox.  It was full when we showed up but the wait was pretty quick, they even give you one of those wireless notifiers that flash and vibrate when the tables ready. Food was decent, i got their hamburger and enjoyed it (their toppings were a little weird, but tasted good).  The outside patio is a fun place to sit although their bushes seems to attract bugs.  Service was kind of slow but nothing unreasonable."}
{"text":"Not a hot spot for late night drinks or dessert.  They close the bar around 10:30 pm on a Saturday Night and will not seat newcomers even for dessert.."}
{"text":"Where to begin. I'll start with the positive: the waitress was nice enough and the wine we ordered was good. On to the negative: everything else. Upon sitting down, both of us were struck by an instinctual urge to leave, but neither of us articulated this vague unease strongly enough to instigate a positive, forward movement towards the exit, and so, in this stupefied state of indecision, we remained rooted in place as the waitress swept up to take our order. Our fate was sealed.   We both decided, in another mind-melded act of self sabotage, to order the steak frites. Both plates came with two slabs of indifferently cooked meat sitting atop a dollop of some kind of flavourless reddish sauce. A complimentary silver chalice of Heinz ketchup accompanied the cafeteria-quality French fries - I cannot bring myself to refer to them as frites, and I don't think the sad French fries themselves would, on their best day, have the audacity to grace themselves with that nomenclature. The steak itself - star of this culinary gong show - was tough, under-seasoned, and carefully prepared for maximum disappointment."}
{"text":"This place has some serious issues with SERVICE! W-T-F  Sat on the patio Friday after work and waited obscenely long to be seated (despite overall lack of customers). Once we had a seat, our server got us a few drinks quick enough. But trying to pay the bill was a complete gong show. After asking a few times and waiting a zillion years, we ended up going inside and harassing the hostess to let us pay.   I don't know if I can be bothered to go back for awhile given the horrible customer service. The food looked decent though."}
{"text":"the location is nice. the setting is appealing and you would expect a very original fusion food menu. but, unfortunatley, the menu is not that original and food is just ok... a correct place, but should make it better and more original and audacious in their menu."}
{"text":"I ordered a roast beef sandwich here, which is something on their fast food menu. That damn sandwich was probably one of the best roast beef sandwiches I've ever put my dirty mouth on. The bread was fresh, the roast beef moist and tender, and the horseradish slaw just made the sandwich a knockout winner. My only knock was I could have comfortably eaten 2 more of them."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the food. Started with the green bean caesar was delicious. The lentils were crunchy dressing really nice ...for the main the octopus salad was delicious perfectly cooked and tender I understand they steam it first and grill later ...  My wife had the lamb gnocci which was also excellent.  Service was fantastic as was the some like it hot cocktail...."}
{"text":"Over hyped. It's a good location but the food isn't worth the price. Definitely a let down for an O&B restaurant.  I had the grilled salmon salad the had edamame and wild grains in it that I could have made. There wasn't a way for me to find a distinct flavour that should make this dish worth $19."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Not unlike Luma, expect to wait and wait and then wait some more; not because it's actually that busy, but because of their anemic staffing policy.   Their \"Grab-and-Go\" menu is anything but, and is perhaps more suitably named the \"Wait-and-Go-Hungry\" menu. I've consistently had to wait 20-25 minutes in line to get a sandwich and drink whenever I come here. AND, each time it wasn't like the line was actually long - 3 to 4 peeps max!   The person handling the cash register, is also the same one making (and touching - yikes!) your sandwich, salad, drink, etc.. The absence of any extra help and kitchen staff is mind-boggling, but this seems to be par for the course for O&B establishments at the TIFF Lightbox (see my Luma review).   The food itself is pretty standard affair and nothing to write home about, and as such, my recommendation would be the street meat vendor across the street if you really need a quick bite, otherwise, there are WAY better options along the strip."}
{"text":"i really like the layout of this place looks like a fancy cafateria with a partial view of the kitchen and food preparation area. gives you a sense that the food will be made well.  when you first arrive the hostess with the mostess usually attends fairly quickly. if there is no seating available you will be offered to sit at the huge communal table until one becomes free. NO Reservations needed from what I could tell.   I ordered the oilive oil pizza with the parm, cured meat, and arugula. I didn't like it (period).  the bread was way too thick and it's basically something a six year old can whip up at home. providing the kid knows what procuitto and arugula is. But that's not to say other dishes are lame too. I've had excellent creative dishes at other O&B restaurants for sure.   I concur with other reviewers in that waiters seem to be \"unattenatative\" i didnt get any rude service in fact he was very polite for the few seconds i saw him but other than dropping off our dishes we never really had a waiter after that. nobody really came around to see how we were doing so in essence we needed to waive down waiters for service. i counted 4 times (refill water, dessert & coffee, napkins, and finally bill)   I wouldn't say I'll never come back but I'll say Bannock rules for now. Although Bannock's service is suspect sometimes too."}
{"text":"I come here from time to time because of the location. I'm always in the area so its a safe and casual place for a quick meal. To be honest, it shouldn't be labelled O&B as there was nothing remotely special here aside from the location.   I've been to Luma upstairs a few times too and I also thought that place was average. Food and service were all typical, nothing extraordinary or worth raving about. The space upstairs was nicer but neither place had a particularly fun or quality vibe. I almost felt like the place was trying too hard without delivering anything exceptional which was disappointing.   The only time I have been in this building and was somewhat impressed was a time when when we weren't eating at any of these restaurants, we were just meeting with TIFF and they actually have a really nice space and interesting story.   Come for a quick lunch but don't expect anything over the top. I would say everything here is good/decent but not memorable."}
{"text":"Love this place! Always a good selection and a fun cheapish place to eat before a film at TIFF. Amazing service really, very friendly and don't pressure you to buy anything. Only thing is that they took away their daily specials :( Last time, I had the calamari tacos. Pretty good but wish the calamari was grilled instead of breaded. Really like the mango sauce though. This is a must at least once before a tiff movie!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch over the weekend. The service was almost non existent for like 10 mins after we sat down... but when someone finally came to take our order, he was quite friendly and helpful. All was forgiven when I had their Calamari Tacos. Call me simple, but the calamari, mango sauce and herb crema in a soft taco really made my day. I did also see several more unique brunch items I'd like to try, so hey I might come back eventually."}
{"text":"Coffee was fresh n hot, the fruit pastry was the most delicious one in the world, I would say. Not too sweet not too soft, just perfect with a coffee"}
{"text":"Not sure why folks are so down on this place. It's not amazing but it seems to be good value with friendly service.  Vegetarians: they have a delicious tofu bahn mi sandwich."}
{"text":"My visit for dinner last winter was excellent (my pasta special which had an incredibly tasty savory spicey anchovy sauce, and the Morrocan tangine dish were stellar). My recent dinner there was just okay.  I really wanted their beef carpaccio but they were out of it that night. I had their special of the day which was Croque Monsieur, which I was excited to order but was majorly let down. I was expecting a rich, artery-clogging grilled ham and cheese sandwich, but instead I just got a rather bland dry lightly grilled ham and cheese sandwich. The fried pickle on the side was very good but the side salad was lacking in flavour and dressing.  We ordered the O&B basket of artisan breads, which was really good bread but lacking in variety (there were only two types of white breads), the small cup of olives and red pepper aioli were good, but for $8 it was very steep for what it is -- other restaurants would serve the same kind of bread complementary.  My cocktail of ginger beer, some kind of hard liquor and chopped cucumber was very tasty and refreshing.  There were strangely a lot of fruit flies in the restaurant for reason that night which I managed to kill half a dozen on the table through the course of the meal. I don't really know the cause or source of the flies.  Service was very good as always. Next time I would stick to their pastas or other substantial cooked dishes rather than their sandwiches (at least for dinner)."}
{"text":"Went there New Year's day for brunch since everything else was closed. The coffee was good, although the server didn't ask if we wanted a refill and service was sort of slow. I had the organic salad and added chicken. The chicken was nicely cooked, with some sea salt and herbs and I liked the toasted pecans and dried tomatoes. It was a bit pricey-$6 salad but $9 to add a chicken breast. My boyfriend got the mushroom burger, which was also good. The place itself was very open and spacious, looked trendy and hip. The breakfast menu was pretty basic, nothing out of the ordinary. For a hearty breakfast and friendlier service I would rather go to Cora's or Eggspectations."}
{"text":"My stomach was not doing too well so I was looking for something light which worked out well here. However, the problem I noticed is it seems to be a whole lot of space with not much going on for the menu and on top of that the items seemed kind of pricey.  I think when I am in more of a mood for a good meal I will take my hunger somewhere else."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here, some times are much better than others. A butter chicken pizza, the mac and cheese, the lamb gnocchi have all been memorable.  Lunch today was a burger and a glass of red wine. Good solid food, slightly absent server but all in all a good meal."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their Forbidden Rice Bowl and great selection of desserts! Banana bread pudding is a must try!!!"}
{"text":"rock-ons: -good food.  better-than-average.  local foods somewhat prioritized, and non-run-of-the-mill creativity with food (ex: today's sweet red pepper gazpacho came with olive oil drizzled and lightly fried capers on its surface); -nice outdoor dining environment where ppl actually weren't chain-smoking; -clean establishment;  say it isn't so: -prices aren't over the top, but they are more pricey here than typical areas, entrees are $10-22.  I paid $11 for a panini and small soup combo, plus $5 for a side salad.  I left comfortably full, but ready to again eat by the time I arrived home; -service was friendly but S-L-O-W with a capital S.  We kept trying to make eye contact with our server or any server for that matter.  Eventually our server came by and we requested more coffee.  The server came back again in a little while, after topping off other customers' coffees along the way (about 8 other customers' coffees, before coming to our table - odd, since it was our table that had asked for the coffee).  Would I go again?  Food was well-prepared, and I'd be curious about what other meal options they'll be offering.  The foodie in me says Yes, but the picky person in me doesn't recommend coming here for quick service."}
{"text":"This was my 3rd visit, and each time the food was barely mediocre. WHERE'S THE FLAVOUR?  - Not in my food, that's for sure.... I went with a group of people for Winterlicious. Now, in my mind I would expect the food to be (extra) good for an event like this. I mean, you're getting people in the door who might not normally go during a non-WInterlicious time AND 1st time customers... wouldn't you want to make sure the food you're serving is of a caliber that would want to make people return and PAY MORE? 1.5 stars"}
{"text":"My first review on Yelp becuz I can't stand the food quality. We ordered calamari tacos as a appetizer which is good. As main, we ordered prawn curry and gnocchi. The prawn curry is really not worth the money. It's 17 CAD and the rice is like from microwave and cold. The prawn is warm and on top of it there's a splash of curry which is warm as well. The quality is just like some plates from food court, or even worst. Not gonna comment on the gnocchi becuz I don't like lamb in the first place. But overall food is not good. Will not go again"}
{"text":"Third time at the Canteen and disappointed again. The third star is a bit generous.    Service has always been pleasant, but far too slow for the off-hours that I've gone there.  The food is solid, particularly at lunch, but at a recent dinner my sandwich had the feel of being sitting out too long. Coffee is sub-par, but the mixed drinks are fantastic.  Overall the location is great, the servers are friendly, and the food is quite decent, but the little things just keep piling up - cold food, slow service - which means your money better spent at one of the many nearby alternatives."}
{"text":"Canteen is a slick name for a restaurant. I expect no less from the Tiff Lightbox. Respect.   I popped in here for a quick bite before a movie, and it was A-OK. A bit pricy, and quite boring, but the soup and salad I had hit the spot. Lentils, kale and some sparkling water were only a B-, but the people watching was A+. Canteen is covered in floor to ceiling windows looking out over their patio and King W. It's quite the scene, and my normally chatty partner and I spent a lot of time gawking and mocking passersby. This might sound bitchy, but it's King W... so it's totally socially acceptable."}
{"text":"Visited a few weeks ago with my two kids.  My son ordered a kid's pizza for $10, he thought it was great.  I had the chicken panini with fries for $16 which I shared with my daughter. Panini was okay, but the fries were awesome!  I was very disappointed with the drink prices.  Ice teas were $6 each with no refills as they are considered mocktails... really?  No cheaper options for kids which I think is ridiculous.  For this reason alone, I am giving a lower rating."}
{"text":"Nice place good service. Soup was so bland , just not great. Turkey panini was good as are the fries."}
{"text":"3.5  I came here with a coworker yesterday. I have walked by many times but had no idea it had anything to do with O&B.  He really wanted to go and said the food was really good. Obviously I looked it up on Yelp before going in and was a little iffy about the 3 stars as that can be very hit or miss. I ended up being pleasantly surprised.  Our waiter was nice and attentive when he explained to us the specials. My coworker got a soup to start. He was starving and asked for crackers. The waiter said they didn't have crackers and offered to bring him some bread. When he walked away I jokingly said, \"if he charges you for the bread, they're losing a star on yelp because he didn't warn you.\" Well, unfortunately we forgot to check for that on the bill, but I feel like they might have charged him because they brought him a small plate with lots of bread and butter. Oh well.  I ordered the turkey pesto panini with tomato chick pea soup as my side. I confirmed with the waiter beforehand that the soup wouldn't be 'chunky tomato' as that does not appeal to me. He said it was not. It was fantastic and I really loved the touch of the chick pea and overall it was really delicious. The panini was out of this world. It was the best I've had in a long time. Not that I eat paninis often but this one was killer! I was kicking myself about it afterwards though because I'm currently dieting and that was a lot of bread. Oh well, gotta treat yourself sometimes I guess!  My coworker got the pulled pork sandwich with fries. The fries came in this cute little pot. He seemed to really enjoy it.  I'd come back but not as my first choice, not for any reason I just like to explore and try new things :)"}
