{"text":"drive thru pick up order. service was good, but the veggies were too sweet and not enough rice to balance out the flavors. I just don't like super sweet food. I save that for dessert."}
{"text":"Not bad went late and wasn't expecting much but was kind of shocked and really good definitely go back again"}
{"text":"By far my favorite Japanese Sushi place. Hibachi chicken with noodles is my personal favorite."}
{"text":"5 stars all the way. Affordable food and very tasty. Service is always awesome. Food comes out quick perfect for lunch break!"}
{"text":"Always a great place to stop as an alternative to fast food!  We eat in, and go through the drive through to pick it up.  Food is always great and consistent.  Prices are fair and portions are generous."}
{"text":"Easy dinner pickup. Sure there's usually a wait, but that's ok. It's coming out hot and fresh. Drive thru Japanese food may not be for all, but when it's been a long day and you don't want to cook, it's a nice change from pizza delivery"}
{"text":"I was in the area tonight and decided to give Sake Express a try. The menu gave a lot of choices and I decided to try something that should have been familiar, teriyaki chicken with fried rice. My dinner was anything but familiar. The chicken had very little flavor, and the flavor the rice had, was bad. The best thing in the box was the candied carrot. The ginger sauce was very good. The service was relatively fast but I was disappointed in both the quality and taste of the food."}
{"text":"Pretty much cafeteria Japanese food. Not bad but not worth going out of your way for."}
{"text":"My wife and I get takeout from there about twice a month.  Service is always friendly and the food had always been tasty and consistent."}
{"text":"Would be better if they used chicken thighs. Doesnt compare to Sarku Japan... a little bland compared to what we are used to..."}
{"text":"Great Food and inexpensive for what you get!  Eat there frequently and have never had a bad meal!  Definitely recommend it!  Very casual!"}
{"text":"Love their food.  Had my order wrong, but waitress was extreeeeemly attentive & eager to make it right & bring extra.  Would be nice if they(& other restaurants) had seperate seating areas for loud kids/teens & for adults/senors who'd like to be able to converse."}
{"text":"Excellent quick hibachi stop. The zucchini and onions are great but their carrots are unreal!"}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight with another couple at the Belmont location for the first time as we usually dine in Gastonia. We decided to use this location as each couple had a discount coupon from the Entertainment book. The coupon reads one free Entrée with the purchase of a second at equal or less value. NO mention is made of any dollar amount. Upon placing our order for two entrees from their menu I was informed that the second/free entrée cannot exceed $8.00 at cost which our two choices both did. I pointed out that nowhere on the coupon was any dollar amount shown but to no avail. They even suggested that the 'mistake' was the fault of the Entertainment book publisher. Be aware of this issue if you are planning to use this same coupon when dining at this location. No issue with the food but still did not come away with aleasant experience."}
{"text":"The food is so-so, but what really gets me is how bad the customer service is. You always have to wait in line for a minimum of 20 minutes to get your food and when you deal with the drive thru staff they are rude and/or unpleasant every time. The Mount Holly location is the ONLY Sake worth eating, it is fantastic every time."}
{"text":"In the past, Sake Belmont, NC provided good food.  The shrimp I received tonight were nasty. Evidently, Sake no longer properly cleans the shrimp they serve. The shrimp had thick bloated black poop shoots from one end to the other... Disgusting! Really, really disgusting! I'm not eating this crap! Do you like to eat shrimp poop? It concerns me if they are cutting corners here, what other shortcuts are they taking in the cleaning, handling, and safe food preparation of all their food?"}
{"text":"First experience and it was not the worst. I thought the drive through concept was really neat and the fact that you could order sushi in the drive thru was awesome. The drive thru experience was not the greatest. My family just moved to Gastonia and we weren't familiar with the items on the list so the gentleman taking orders asked two of his co workers if they could bring a menu out and they gave him the worst look ever. No one bothered to get us a menu. We ended up looking it up online. The food wasn't the greatest either. I thought that may have made the experience better but not even."}
{"text":"For japanese fast food, I love it. I can run in, order, head out pretty quick. The staff is friendly. If you want to eat the place has always been really clean. I just wished they deliveried!  :))"}
{"text":"Sake Express is Delicious!! Whenever I am in the area I always make sure to grab some Sake to go. I typically get the Shrimp entree with rice and sweet carrots. Its always hot, delicious and very inexpensive. If you are dining in this is a casual place for a quick lunch or dinner. 

I will definitely go back and definitely recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"This place is my weakness. Teriyaki chicken combo and the 3C roll is to for for. My favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"I love coming here. The food is good and the sushi doesn't make me sick. I typically get the bento box. This location is a lot faster than the Belmont, but I imagine it doesn't get as many customers."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go if I'm starving and have almost no money. I always order the kids hibachi chicken. It's cheaper if you order the kids but almost the same size just a tad smaller, I can't finish a regular plate anyway. It is great tasting, filling, fast, and cheap. Most of the time the service is great but if a new employee tries to work the cash register it gets a little complicated. But I suggest using the spot card if you are a frequent visitor, I've gotten several free items through that."}
{"text":"I must say I tried the Sake in Belmont again and they have REDEEMED themselves.  Their taste is more like the original location and it was as good as it gets.  Maybe they trained or replaced the cook.  Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"The food is alright but some of the female staff there have really bad attitudes. I called to place a sushi order and the girl on the phone was NOT friendly at all. It seem like it was a hassle for her to put in my order."}
{"text":"This is currently my family's favorite Japanese restaurant, and we don't even live in Gastonia. We make a special trip there every couple of weeks for the food. 

The Hibachi chicken and Teriyaki steak are delicious, and their sushi is some of the best I've had. 

We like it so much we ordered a huge amount of food for our Christmas party (you know, to mix it up instead of the same old ham, deviled eggs, etc). The lady, I think her name is Lisa, who took our order was so helpful in determining how much to order and when we picked up the food she even threw in a bunch of egg rolls! The food was a huge hit and we couldn't have been happier with the service."}
{"text":"The food is always consistent and good.  This is the origional location and I personally like the taste of this one better than the one in Belmont.  Mt. Holly is good too.  Their carrots are some of the best I've tasted.  Good inexpensive choice!"}
{"text":"Good food at a reasonable price.  It is a small quaint restaurant.  I like it better than their fancy Belmont location.  The food there has a different taste.  They have a friendly staff and the food is worth the value."}
{"text":"When you enter restaurant it smells horrible. That is a first sign of disgust. Food has an after taste. Manager/owners could careless about customer satisfaction. I ordered steak & broccoli.  Food came out and the meat was bloody. I do not eat nor did I order medium rare food. After Lisa brought out the food I told her the steaked looked disgusting and she threw my plate and walked off. I asked for a refund and she told me I was not getting my money back b/c she cooked me two plates. No, I wanted my money back b/c I was treated poorly. Aftet calling both locations I decided to call back. She lied & said I said the food looked like shit. \"What?\" I never; never used those words. That was her way of covering her butt. Will never eat there again."}
{"text":"First time at Sake Express.. went drive thru. Staff was friendly.  Ordered teriyaki chicken plate.  Taste was ok.  Didn't have enough rice to finish my plate."}
{"text":"Sake Express:  Great food at a great price!  This place is for the people who get tired of the fast food, deep fried chains in Belmont.  Typically you pick your grilled meat of choice (chicken/steak/fish) which then will be accompanied by rice and sweet carrots.  Although you can switch up the rice/carrots with other veggies/noodles.  This place simply makes great food at a very comparable price of other fast food chains.  I have also noticed that their chicken is very tender and juicy versus other fast food Japanese restaurants I have ate at who tend to over cook and dry the chicken out. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"I think their shrimp sauce is made from unicorn tears it's so good. The carrots are better than most. The teriyaki chicken plate is cheaper than a burger combo across the street and 100x better. I probably don't eat here enough, but it's always consistent, never a let down. I think it's the best Japanese around for the money."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Fast and healthy!  I always do the shrimp with brown rice and my husband does the yakinuku steak with mushrooms.  So yummy and the kids love it!  And with 2 toddlers, I love that I can do drive through there and not have to haul 2 kids out of the car and manage them while waiting."}
{"text":"Well it was my first time to eat at Sake Express (take out). So I walk in at 9:38PM, Saturday 11/14/2015 I start place my order and I was told they are out of sushi and maki rolls. WTF! I'm sure that's a flat out lie!!! They close at 10:00PM and all food should be available and served till closing time. I walked out ticked off and you just lost 30.00 in sales in a food order. I will never step foot in this place ever and I will let other know of the unacceptable service and to be lie I was told by the irreplaceable employee. The lie upset me more than the food from this wannabe sushi restaurant. They have sushi but they where in early clean-up and didn't want to make it!"}
{"text":"I get food here from the drive-thru about once a week.  On my way home from work and the food is good and priced right IMO.  I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Placed a call in order for 2 chicken teriyaki and when I went to pick up there was only 1 so I waited for other...the new one they made I had eaten and got horrible food poisoning ...throwing up & liquid diarrhea dripping in sweat and light headed for 2 hours practically dying with a newborn crying for me and a 5 year old at home! Glade I made something else for my son and didn't give him some of my food! This was horrible and I eat there alot...prob never again now"}
{"text":"Very friendly & helpful staff, great food at a low price. They have healthy options too. We are definitely frequent diners!"}
{"text":"Can't beat this place!  The foods great, the staff is even better.  Always friendly.  My daughter & I go here once a week!  Love it."}
{"text":"Sake Express does not disappoint, especially my wallet. Very good sized portions for the price and I would eat here for $7 before just about anywhere else in Belmont. I typically get either the teriyaki chicken or steak entree which is plenty filling. The steak has been a little tough once or twice but not recently, the chicken is always nice and juicy and tender, though."}
{"text":"Ok for quick Japanese Sake is very good.  A few more veggie in the main dishes and I would be set.  We had shrimp and steak, chicken and steak combs and a kids shrimp and haf more than we could eat. Yelp it was good.."}
{"text":"Guys. Seriously. GIVE ME MY CHOPSTICKS. It never fails, every single time I order take out sushi you guys NEVER and I mean NEEEVVERRR not once (and I've even reminded you at the speaker) have put chopsticks or soy sauce in my bag. And by the time I check the bag the server has already walked back inside (Since you usually have to park and wait for sushi). I love sake, but please for the love of all things delicious GIVE ME MY CHOPSTICKS AND SAUCES. I'd rather not eat them with my hands."}
{"text":"If anyone gives this place less than a 5 star rating, they are dumb.  They have some of the best Salmon I have ever had, the tilapia comes in at a close second.  There is always the tried and true chicken and steak plates too.  Everyone is always nice and service is great."}
{"text":"I love Hibachi, problem is, it tends to be expensive and it's a time commitment. Not anymore with Sake. This is a fast approach to hibachi, and the food is great and reasonable priced.

This is my second time here. All orders are prepared fresh similar to what you get at a Hibachi restaurant, except for the shoots, which I love and do miss, but other then tha this place is great.

First time I had scallops and shrimp, very delicious. This time I had just the shrimp, still very good, and They will even serve adults from their kids menu, the got my vote."}
{"text":"The food here has it moments of highs and lows. I humbly think the food experience here has changed since they moved locations. The food isn't as good as it was on new hope rd. Not all that thrilled about eating here unless I haven't had it in awhile then I crave it. I usually order the hibachi chicken well done with brown rice, my husband orders the hibachi steak with brown rice and Ginger sauce. Its OK but could be better."}
{"text":"I Love Sake Express!!! What can I say I'm a hibachi type a girl. I love going to the Japanese restaurant the only thing I don't like is having to wait for all of your meal to make it to your plate. With this place you don't even have to get out of your car! (What ) Sake has a drive thru!!! You do have to wait 5-7 minutes after you order and pay to get your food. Someone brings it out to your car. Not a big deal in my opinion for the amazing food that's in that white box. Whenever we go there my six-year-old always yells mom don't forget the Yum Yum sauce!"}
{"text":"Enjoy dinning in, fast service even when they look busy! Drive thru is also a nice bonus when we are rushing home to watch a show or the game. Sake has been a staple in our eat-out rotation for years and will be for years to come. Our go to favorites are the Chicken, Chicken & Shrimp, and egg rolls!!"}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill FAST.  We visited a few weeks ago and waited over an hour for food.  Tonight we decided to give it another chance.  When we arrived with our two young children at 6:45 on a Tuesday evening we were told they were only accepting take out orders despite the restaurant being half empty.  Oh!  I almost forgot.  We counted them throw away AT LEAST 20 plates of food the last time we ate there.  They just couldn't get it together."}
{"text":"Come to LA that's all I got to say 
**Also work on the sushi!! I'd give that no stars!**"}
{"text":"Great place to eat Japanese food fast, tasty and well priced. They are usually pretty busy, so just make sure you take your time, but HEY if it's busy like that it means is good, so I don't mind the wait!!!"}
{"text":"I really do like this place and am always satisfied when i go! but today I called for a take out order and wanted to order salmon with the noodles and the young man who answerd said it wasn't possible because he does not know how to ring that up. He offerd me a side salmon and a side noodle, but no veggies. I then asked him to ask someone and find out, and i could here him in the back ground \"hey, so there is no way to make a salmon noodle right, no way!\" \"yes mam, i can offter you a side of salmon and noodle with no veggies\"....i dont understand, i work in a resturant and this is something we could have done! If you have all the neseccary parts you should be able to put them together! maybe i dont want rice with my salmon!! now im going to eat taco bell!!!"}
{"text":"It's average, it tastes good for quick hibachi take out but they don't allow substitutions and they are quite pricey"}
{"text":"Always the best!
Prices and choices are fantastic. Lots of options. They serve sushi but didn't order it. Ginger sauce and shrimp sauce available when ordering. 
All the great things a Japanese steak house would have just not the Hitachi grill. (good for kids or 1st dates lol)
Tapanyaki noodles with chicken very good and lots of food.
Hitachi filet cooked perfectly.
Egg roll was a spring roll and fresh and yummy.
Service was fast and polite!
Will come back again and again"}
{"text":"This place is okay. When I pulled in the parking lot there were no cars in the drive through. However a long line grew behind me. I was asked to pull around and they would bring me my food. I parked along the side and 6-7 other cars joined the wait pool. It took a bit to long. In fact, other cars behind me received their order first. The food was just okay. When I'm in a pinch for Hibachi, I'd stopped there again to give them another try."}
{"text":"I live in Charlotte & every time I'm out towards Gaston County, I look forward to go to Sake.  I wish they had something like this over by me.  

I recommend the teriyaki chicken and egg rolls which are more like spring rolls.  The chicken is not dry like some of the other express Japanese places I've been to in the past. Oh and their shrimp sauce is amazing too.

They have you order at the counter and sit, then a waitress comes around and ask for your receipt which I've usually already thrown in my purse. That part seems kind of backwards to me. Why they don't get number cards like mccalisters, idk. 

Bottom line, food is great, price are super reasonable, customer service could be better."}
{"text":"Their food is always good and cooked to just the right way. I love the shrimp sauce that they give you! This location is always busy every time I've been here (around dinner time). The drive through sometimes does take a while to get your food out to you, and often they will have you pull in one-of-two spots to wait for your food. It is worth it though because it's hot and freshly cooked when you get it!"}
{"text":"Good food at a great price. Went to lucky samurai down the street first but after looking at the place I didn't trust the reviews.

This place is great for a quick hibachi style lunch/dinner for around $6-8.

I walked in during lunch to see the place quite crowded, a good sign.  The line at the register went quick.  They handed us a reciept and told us to grab a seat.  I wasn't quite sure how the drink thing worked at first but, after a few minutes a \"waitress\" came by and took the reciept and filled our drink orders.  The food was fast.  My counterparts chicken was really good.  Moist, flavorful, and delicious.  My steak however, not so much.  I should have spent the extra $2 to make it filet.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't good.  We also ordered the veggie tempura.  The mushroom was barely cooked and should have probably been cut in half.  Still a great deal at $3.99 though.

I like this spot.  If I'm in Gastonia and craving fastfood Japanese, this will be my first choice."}
{"text":"Very bad service in the drive through and then they were rude when I tried to redeem a coupon. The print was super small on the date and they said it was two days late."}
{"text":"Had the teriyaki steak last night and either they didn't cook the food well or it was just dirty, I got food poisoning last night from eating there and it wasn't fun. Wouldn't eat there again."}
{"text":"My husband and I like Sake Express, but we normally order the low carb chix, steak or shrimp.  We're not a fan of the sweet carrots and a huge portion of rice, so we skip that and get more veggies on the low carb plate.  There's a plethora of these types of restaurants in Gastonia and this one is the best in our opinion."}
{"text":"I  didn't like the food at all, my brown rice was hard and the carrots was very sweet . Very disappointing for Japanese food."}
{"text":"I live in Belmont, and this restaurant has the worst service ever!!! They are rude, the food takes an insane amount of time, and it's been the same every time I come. I'm done with this location. They have given be the wrong order several times, and I never receive so much as an apology."}
{"text":"Fantastic food with awesome staff!! A meal there can make anyone's day!!! Wonderful experience guaranteed!!"}
{"text":"I know it's a chain, but YUM!  We don't have many restaurants within a 5 minute driving distance so I was extremely excited to find that Sake Express is close to us AND has tasty food.  I've been here 3 times now and I always get the veggie hibachi entree.  It comes with an awesome mix of broccoli, squash, mushroom, onion, zucchini on top of fried rice and topped off with sweet carrots.  The portions are huge and there's always plenty for leftovers.  The food and service here have been consistently good.  This location is brand new so it's nice and clean.  When I'm starving and don't want to cook this is a reliable quick and delicious meal."}
{"text":"So when I first ate at this restaurant I was satisfied, it was the best Japanese food I had since moving from up North. Although it is not quite as good as the Japanese food I'm use to at home it is quite delicious and has grown on me more and more. The drive through however sucks, you wait for awhile and then just when you think the wait may be over, you pay for your food and they ask you to pull into a parking spot to wait even longer. I would definitely recommend this place though, especially the Hibachi chicken and steak with carrots."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!!  The Japanese food is so, so good. Even their dessert, the chocolate cake, is great.  Definitely a place I eat often and never been disappointed by.  Only hate that they dont do there coupons deals anymore."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. I got the Yakiniku steak. It was delicious!  Love the sweet carrots too!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick lunch on the way to charlotte.  Food was good and tasted fresh, the service was great.  The dining room could have been cleaner, table was sticky."}
{"text":"The entrees pretty basic. All of the menu options are essentially a vegetable (broccoli or carrots), rice (white, brown or fried), and some kind of rather bland meat. If you're lucky, you might get some cabbage or mushrooms. The shrimp sauce is good, though I've never encountered it anywhere other than NC/SC, so I doubt its Japanese authenticity.

The sushi is ok. Honestly, I've gotten better sushi at grocery stores up north. I think there are just pretty low standards for good quality Japanese food in the area. 

All that being said, the staff are friendly, attentive, and speedy. I know a lot of people favor it for a quick but yummy lunch break."}
{"text":"The restaurant is old okay?! But the food is amazing!!! A kids meal is more than enough food for me and only $5.33 total!! Super yummy food and really nice people. They also have newer locations in Gastonia, NC and Belmont, NC. I think they should open in more states! We eat at the Gastonia location at least 2xs a week! I eat at the Mt.Holly location because I work nearby! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"First restaurant I ever visited in Belmont and still one of my favorites! Japanese fast food without compromising quality. Recommend trying the ginger sauce over the ubiquitous shrimp sauce. $.99 onion soup is a nice appetizer. Lots of young wait staff (highschool aged)."}
{"text":"For a quick Japanese restaurant express, it's not too bad. I've eaten here a couple of times and today I tired the teriyaki salmon. It was pretty good, I could've used more teriyaki sauce on the salmon. The portion size of the salmon was pretty good. 

The salmon was supposed to be the daily special and the guy over charged me  I pointed it out to an employee and the manager apologized and refunded me the difference. Pretty good customer service."}
{"text":"Very good fast food type Japanese hibachi food. Their prices are good and you get a lot for your money. They have low carb options and great spring rolls. We like to order a side of fried zucchini with our food also."}
{"text":"Very good fast food type Japanese hibachi food. Their prices are good and you get a lot for your money. They have low carb options and great spring rolls. We like to order a side of fried zucchini with our food also."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place.  I have came here since it opened.  I love the teriyaki chicken with broccoli.  Shrimp sauce with my rice is the best.  I recently changed to gluten free lifestyle and even the gluten free options here are awesome in taste."}
{"text":"We were enormously impressed by the friendly customer service we received here today. Sake Express in Belmont, North Carolina exceeded our expectations by not only the food being hot, fresh and delicious but also by the excellent customer service we received from the moment we walked in the door to the professional wait staff. The atmosphere is fun friendly and upbeat while attending to our needs they also made sure the restaurant and restrooms were A+++ we will return again to eat here soon. Best Japanese Steak House Restaurant in town!!!"}
{"text":"The food was great as always, but got the service was terrible. Not only did the person taking our order over the phone take ages to take our order and answer our questions, we were told they would split our order in two no problem. Then when we get to the resultant our food was wrong, bagged incorrectly, and then they decided to tel us we couldn't split our food. Had they told us his would have been a problem we wouldn't have worried about it, but after having to deal with all of that nonsense I don't think I'll be stopping at his location again."}
{"text":"So my family and I had decide to go to the other sake on park street for lunch  and man was it good so for dinner we decide to eat it again, so we searched for a closer one to our hotel and so we found this one one mt holly , once we got there the first thing we noticed was how it resembled an old run down Chinese place  , but anyways we decided to try it anyways, my father ordered the steak and scallop with a Pepsi ,my mother ordered low carb scallops and I ordered the steak and shrimp and once we ordered we proceeded to sit down when we sat down the seat started to fall apart , but that's nothing compared to the food , the Pepsi was flat the fried rice was over seasoned ( too much soy sauce) the scallops were so-so with some slightly over cooked and some just under cooked and broccoli seemed under cooked to me , however my mushrooms were delicious and they gave me a generous amount of shrimp. Overall a three star rating I would much rather recommend the one on park street for multiple reasons first being superior service , bigger menu(sushi)"}
{"text":"This place rocks! The food is not only delicious and cooked quickly but you cannot beat the prices. Seriously, it is so hard to find well priced hibachi places until now. The staff are also very friendly and will be willing to help with all your hibachi/sushi needs. Sadly, I'm from out of town but I will be going back for more as soon as I'm back in Gastonia."}
{"text":"To each time I order this dish yakinu steak it's always different. This is the driest driest steak ever. You can literally count the pieces of vegetable in this case broccoli 5 pieces. See pic. Never going back bad experience with this order. This is nothing like the yakinu stek that I've ordered on more than one occasion. I give up on Sake Express"}
{"text":"My all time favorite Japanese express! I live in Charlotte and so wish we had a Sake.  The food is always fresh and not greasy!  Also has a great shrimp sauce!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner and tried teriyaki chicken and Dynamite roll. Food taste was OK. Ambience was good and staff were very kind and receptive. Service was fast. Dine in and Drive through available. Great place for lunch I guess."}
{"text":"Excellent appearance of completely tasteless food.  I went in pretty hungry and the large plate I got was really bland and the ingredients themselves appeared colorful, large and appetizing but Zero flavor!"}
{"text":"For the money you cannot get any better than this. Have never had a problem here and never had a bad meal. The portions are good and the food is great. This place has gotten even better since they have sushi. The service has gotten better more like sit down restaurant than a fast food place. The sushi is pretty good not as good as a mainly sushi place but the rolls are enjoyable. I eat there almost weekly."}
{"text":"Awesome Sushi! Dragon G Roll is by far the best Sushi Roll I've ever had! Awesome service as well!"}
{"text":"This is THE BEST place to eat in Belmont hands down. The food is always fresh unlike that"}
{"text":"The food here is generally good, but lately we have noticed a few things:
- they run out of Filet too often.  Plan better!
- the Chicken is not trimmed, get gristel and fat too often."}
{"text":"No stars from me. My wife and I were big fans. We used to go to the one in Mt. Holly and Gastonia. When they opened in Belmont we were excited. But WOW how their service has changed compared to Gastonia. It's awful. The one manager there is arrogant and has no idea about customer service. We called in an order and asked for no mushrooms. Go home and it had mushrooms.  Called them and that manager said you have to request no mushrooms. We did. Went back to the store after arguing with him that we can't eat it they were going to make it again. Got there and he asks for the receipt. Gave it to him and he says \"see it doesn't say no mushrooms \". Now if you have ever ordered from there you know that they out the order printout on your order along with the receipt. I told him that and that the server didn't give me that printout. That's where the no mushrooms would be. He shut up. Never going back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Have eaten here lots of times and have never had a problem.  Not sure this time what happened.  I ordered a Hibachi Shrimp and a Teriyaki Steak and my son and I both shared each.  We were both very ill last night and today. And I know it was from the food because the only other thing I had to eat was a banana in the morning. .  Not cool!  Food poisoning sucks!"}
{"text":"Ahhh sake express. Should I say no more? Or let's just be real about this, if your live in gaston county u learned that a cup of shrimp sauce, rice and sweet carrots is perfectly acceptable meal lol. Shrimp sauce, has absolutely nothing to do with shrimp but it's like crack cocain, once u take that first hit. Baby I hooked! I've been eating at the Gastonia location since I was 6-7yrs old n discovered shrimp sauce lol, 20 years later they are still the top restaurant in gaston county. Me living in Belmont my whole life n having Belmont location open, I was excited. I even decided to work at the Belmont location for a veryyyy short period of time. I'm better at eating then working lol. Since the addition of the sushi menu I have to say, I love the options! Get some sashimi or tuna tataki to munch on first then go ham on your hibachi.  Fast, fresh, delish."}

Mount holly location, it's smaller than the other two and I don't believe they serve sushi there, but that's my Dmv location, everytime I gotta go to the dmv I stop into this location for the hook up"}
{"text":"I love Sake.  This is our Saturday night in food.  I hate calling in orders to take out places because they never get it right but Sake does.  I call it in and drive through and get it and it lasts two meals.  I love the noodles woth Hbachi Chicken and Filet."}
{"text":"We had a bad experience previously at Sake Express. Erin reached out to me and offered to make up for our bad experience. He went above and beyond. Our food was delicious and no issues this time. It was speedy service and courteous employees."}
{"text":"Love Sake Express.  Great food, doesn't matter if it's take out or eat in. Love all the locations of Sake but Mt Holly is closest.  Always  great food."}
{"text":"Seriously the quickest friendliest most delicious asian fusion restaurant in the area. Maybe even in Charlotte area. Extremely great service and always quick. We eat here at least once a week. I've tried others in Gastonia but they can't match Sakes prices, food or service. If I were the owner I'd be proud to have such a devoted great team of workers. You can tell they enjoy their job and do their job very well."}
{"text":"My fave is the teriyaki chicken or hibachi chicken and spring roll. I have this tasty food at least once a week, love coming here!"}
{"text":"I am so glad I have discovered this restaurant! I have my weekly fix of the hibachi chicken with spring roll. The prices, food, and employees are great."}
{"text":"This place looks scary. When I first saw it I said there is no way I would ever eat there.  I have no idea what's the sanitation rating is, nor do I want to know because the food is fantastic. Fresh ingredients and always hot."}
{"text":"After a failed attempt to get food at the other new place in Belmont, Jax, we ended up at Sake Express. They are definitely a very welcome addition to Belmont eateries. 
This was our first visit to any Sake Express. It starts out as a normal fast food joint placing your order at the front counter, but then you pick your seat and a server comes and brings you your drinks and then your food. This place was a perfect fusion of fast food (got our food fast) and sit down service (more attentive service then 90% of sit-down restaurants).
As far as the food, we ordered the vegetable entree and 1 eggroll and the teriyaki chicken. With 1 drink and a water the total came out to $13.21 plus a few dollars tip.  
The vegetable entree was superb. A mix of zucchini, mushroom, onions, carrots, squash and broccoli were cooked in a soy sauce which added just enough flavor without taking away the full flavor of the vegetables. \"Deeeeee-licious\" -wife
The teriyaki flavor of the chicken wasn't outstanding, but the carrots that came with it were. The generous 4 ounce cup of shrimp sauce mixed with the chicken and rice made it a solid meal.
The menu seemed like a good selection, however no sushi in case you were wondering."}
{"text":"This place sucks it's nasty the service sucks I will not be returning me and my wife are African American Muslims and the way the staff treated us was sickening I felt as if we was mistreated because of our religious practices the little gook waitress could not keep our cup from going empty I will not be back thanks to the terrible service"}
{"text":"This is our go-to for evenings we don't feel like cooking.  We often just do drive thru but sometimes we will go in.  The food is even better hot off the grill and the service is great.  

I usually get the Chicken Teriyaki and sometimes add an eggroll.  I like the Chicken and Cabbage also.  The sushi is good also."}
{"text":"Sake Express - I wish I could quit you but I can't.  I had seen Sake Express for years but hadn't eaten here until a few years ago when my daughter came home and demanded that we go.  We are now complete slaves to the Sake and LOVE their food.  Typically I get the Chicken Teriyaki but sometimes I get Chicken and Cabbage or the Bento Box meal.  I had the Scallops once and I can't believe I have resisted having them again.  

In all, you will become addicted to Sake if you try it.  We introduced another friend to it and now he is on the Sake Express train."}
{"text":"Great customer service, quick and efficient drive through, good sushi options for the person on the go or in need of a quick hibachi fix!"}
{"text":"I grew up going to Sake Express in Gastonia, so I'm a little biased, but I always enjoy swinging through just to grab a quick bite. Nothing to knock your socks off, but always a reliable eat when you need a quick Japanese fix for cheap."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Gastonia, this is typically where my wife and I eat. There standard (hibachi) are good, but their sushi is really good too. Lots of very unique rolls and daily specials available at a variety of price ranges. They always have really good service too, so that's a plus."}
{"text":"For an express hibachi place I was very surprised that the food was good. Shrimp sauce is thinner than what I typically get but taste did the job. Will be coming back to try other items next time."}
{"text":"Food is great and comes out quickly. I used the drive thru Service. An employee took my order at my car. Only bad part is I felt a little rushed to order when I wanted to look at the actual drive thru window. Chicken and shrimp hibachi w/shrimp tempura roll and a side salad with ginger dressing."}
{"text":"Every time I come home this place is a must. Last night we were treated with excellent customer service. You can tell that the owners care about their guests. Thank You. \"We'll be back.\""}
{"text":"Went there last night, great concept, good looking food ... Tasteless and bland."}
{"text":"Twice in the last two weeks the order has been wrong, served with a side of attitude, and the good cold by the time I wait to get the correct d full order.  I think I'm done.  Once is understandable.  Twice on two visits?  No.  Uh uh."}
{"text":"Great food and good service. Love that they have a Belmont location. Never have I had a problem with the food. Even my kids will ask to eat here- which is rare with there being no playground- lol. Only wish they had Coke instead of Pepsi."}
{"text":"Food is good but when you tell them no carrots and extra broccoli you should get more than 5 pieces. My oldest son got extra mushrooms instead of carrots and got 7 mushroom bits. Not extra at all. Also the prices are too high for the little bit you get. A chicken and steak combo should be enough to split between me and my 7yr old son but it deffinently was not. I had literally 7 pieces of chicken and 10 pieces of steak along with about 1/2 a cup of rice. You get way more if you eat inside but not through the drive thru."}
{"text":"We were visiting friends in the Charlotte area and they had suggested Sake Express several times before. The food was excellent and the service was great.  I just wish we had one near to us."}
{"text":"This restraunt is a great addition to Belmont.  In the evening it is always crowded.  It takes a little longer than the Gastonia Sake Express to get your food in the drive thru.  This Sake Express also does not have sushi.  The inside is really nice with a waterfall near the main entrance.  If you want to eat in, go to the Belmont Sake."}
{"text":"I prefer the original Sake in Gastonia but it is no longer there, but this is a great second! Wonderful prices and delicious food! Staff is friendly and great atmosphere! I normally get the teriyaki chicken with shrimp sauce and its delicious!"}
{"text":"This is the new Sake in town. I have to say I miss the old one that used to be across the street which was definitely a five star. My husband and I both got the teriyaki chicken, which was delicious. Chicken was not dry and had lots of flavor. The shrimp sauce was not quite as good as the old location or the Belmont location as it was very orange. Other than that all was delicious and when I'm back in the Gastonia area I will be back."}
{"text":"Wasn't terrible but wasn't magnificent. Service was decent but awkward, kind of looked like a kid's plate coming out(which for $9 each I expected a bit more). The girl that seemed to be assigned to our area was quite spacey and forgetful, much more interested in talking with her friends who were seated at another table. Ordered a \"bento box\" which we knew would be a smaller portion, so when it came out as it did, that was on us, I suppose. Very basic, fast food.  I'd rather get a togo or drive thru in the future. Or go to another spot.
Edit: Giving another star because we decided to give it another go, this time on a Sunday, the food was hot and the service was much better, I guess our first time was just not the best."}
{"text":"Go there often on my way home from work. My family loves the food and the service is always fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This easy first visit.  This is a good alternative to regular fast food options.  I had the low carb chicken habachi which means no rice but double zucchini, onions and mushrooms.  This was actually a pretty good quick meal.  I also ordered edemame which was  not so good....tasted old or too done."}
{"text":"Always great food and great service! Some of the best fast food hibachi around! I drive 30 minutes from Rock Hill,SC just to eat here!"}
{"text":"This place is a mess!!!! My colleagues and I placed an order for our lunch break just to walk in pay and leave and the cashier didn't get our orders right and she put them under a different name so it took forever for them to find our orders and then the food was DISGUSTING. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worse enemy!!"}
{"text":"My new favorite spot for a quick Japanese fix. Their sushi rolls are spot on and the prices aren't half bad either! Lovely waitresses and fast services. 

Hibachi meals are wonderful, got the chicken and fried rice this time around. If you're in a hurry and want some sushi: these guys are my go-to. Love it!"}
{"text":"Apparently a Gastonia/Belmont staple (according to my husband), we almost always make a stop here when in town! Fast Japanese food. Who would have thought that could be good? But it is! The menu is pretty big and we usually go with the simple shrimp/chicken combo. It comes with rice but you can make it low carb and just have double veggies instead. It also has sushi, bento boxes, teppanyaki noodles, and more! We love you, Sake Express! Come to TX, please!"}
{"text":"Decent Japanese food for a decent price. Decent service and clean environment. Noodles are really good and zucchini and onions are good."}
{"text":"Favorite hibachi spot in the Charlotte area! Fresh food made to order && on your busy days they even have a drive through! The shrimp sauce is amazing!"}
{"text":"Fast service. For the price u don't get much good. The waitress stay 2 feet from your tables watching you eating waiting for you to take a sip of water so they can refill it. So Annoying! Anyway I prefer take out. Good for fast food!"}
{"text":"This place is dirty! They have waitress and the entire time I was eating nobody cleaned this table. They were not busy and the waitress were huddled talking. The chicken taste like rubber! Yuck flavorless food."}
{"text":"The experience here has been miserable. We ordered two rolls and a bento box to-go. I made the mistake of trying to order something i can typically get with no trouble anywhere else, spicy yellowtail extra spicy. The girl taking the order had to check twice on what should be an incredibly simple order. When i specifically asked if they had red pepper flakes i was told no. I'm not sure what restaurant, especially asian, doesn't have red pepper flakes. Because of my request i was then made to feel completely uncomfortable by the guys making the sushi who kept looking at me and laughing. The problem was quickly compounded when they forgot to give us our full order when we left making for a miserable night. When i called to complain i was not offered any compensation for our time, just the basic offer to redo it. What about my wasted gas and evening driving back and forth to this shitty restaurant. The place was not especially busy or under-staffed. so i cannot give them a pass. **Update** they comped us a $10 gift card for the trouble and apologized profusely. I was still underwhelmed by the sushi when i finally did get to eat."}
{"text":"Fast food meets wok cooking, Sake Express has worked out how to combine a bunch of ingredients and make it into a double dozen number of entrees. Pick your protein (chicken, steak, shrimp, scallops, etc), pick your veggies (mushrooms, snap peas, etc) and pick your starch (noodles, white rice, brown rice or none) and a few minutes later, it's brought to your table. If you're looking to filly your belly for only a handful of dollars, this is the place. The noodles and rice take up most of the space - so if you're eating low carb you might be disappointed with the quantity.

Here's my complaint. They have a wait staff who brings your order to the table and they are also responsible for refilling your drinks. There is a big sign over the soda fountain (Pepsi products) area that it's \"employees only\". Which is a problem because our waiter spent ten minutes talking to two customers at one of the outside tables instead of checking in on us. Bruce gets thirsty, donchaknow?"}
{"text":"I come here often for lunch. Probably too much. I've only ordered maybe 3-4 things on the menu. I usually stick with my favorite-the Dragon Roll. It's pricey but so good! I've never eaten in, I call ahead and go back to my office. I deducted 1 star because they have a practice of - instead of answering the phone when they're busy - they will just disconnect the call. So, you call and it rings and rings. No one answers and the next thing you know the call is disconnected. So you have to call back several times to get anyone to answer. Other than that the employees for the most part are nice and friendly. There's this one young teenage girl however who always appears to have a scowl on her face at the register. It's a shame because she's beautiful. I wrote on the tip line once \"smile more and maybe you'll get more tips\". Dunno if it worked. The next time I saw her she was still scowling."}
{"text":"This has been one of my favorite places to go for years, but tonight my experience was horrible. I made a mobile order, showed up when it should be ready, checked in,  and waited 30 minutes before they realized that it had been ready all along... I was a little annoyed but didn't say anything because I knew they had been busy. However, when I arrived at home I realized that they had given me a Bento box with no sushi. I called before coming back to ask that it could be ready since I had already spent so much time waiting. When I got there, it was sitting on the counter with a note that said pick up for sushi. I had no apology(come on!) and no offer for a discount or refund... I had hoped that they would at least give me a full order of sushi to apologize, but I got a half order. 

Long story short, some improvements need to be made for mobile orders on busy evenings, this was a mess and it will be a while before I come back."}
{"text":"Came across this place while traveling! I hate fast food so thought this was a way to get quick food; but not fast food. It was so worth it. Plan to spend about $12 BUT you are paying for freshly cooked food that is far more nutritional than Burger King."}
{"text":"What a little gem.  It sure doesn't look like much, but man, the food. 
I got the jumbo shrimp and broccoli. My friend got the chicken and scallops. 
The jumbo shrimp was really jumbo. The scallops are sea scallops. Big and tender. The chicken was moist. All of it was cooked to perfection.
This is just a little place with limited seating. Don't expect a date night location, but for being another hibachi food joint, the food is the top. I will be back any time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Food here is always great. Service is hit or miss with a lot of employees just standing around, it shouldn't take long to be greeted or your order taken, but it always does. Decent food/experience at a decent price."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food. But I ordered through the drive through at a few minutes before noon. Here it is several minutes after noon and I'm still waiting for my teriyaki chicken over brown rice. Not fast food."}
{"text":"I've been here many times; dining in and drive-thru.  I recommend, for sure.  My favorite is the Chicken Teriyaki w/ Broccoli.  The portion sizes are plentiful.  When dining in, the staff is very attentive; they check on you often.  The food is served quickly.  This establishment appears to be well-managed."}
{"text":"Soooooo come here a lot and have slowly seen a decrease in service, portions, and quality. 

Drive thru: slow, inaccurate, but there is one awesome guy who makes up for it. 

Dine in: apparently you have to be a young fit male to get attention here. Our waitress hasn't even been to the table. Someone else has been checking on us. 
This isn't the first time this has happened here either. 
Had to talk to the manager, he was kinda rude. Was suppose to get a free meal for the last mess up, I got 2.00's off instead b/c he had no clue. Wasn't going to argue, but they need customer service boot camp & to stop being skimpy. The kids meal had more food than the over cooked steak bento box we ordered. My noodles, were over done, and so was my broccoli.

All in all I would say not happy, and probably won't be back any time soon. Which is sad, I loved this place."}
{"text":"Sake Express is an interesting concept that my in-laws have fallen love with in Gastonia, NC, close to their hometown of Charlotte. When we visited with them we were struck by the fact that they have a drive-thru--through which you can order SUSHI!! So cool! They seemed to have some really affordable specials and the dishes on their menu ranged in price from $8-17. If you're dining in, you order your food upfront as you would at a fast food restaurant then you sit down (self-serve seating) and wait until a server brings it to your table. 

The interior of the restaurant was very clean and tidy and they have plentiful seating. The thing I liked most was their booths...they're huge! The booth we chose for the four of us could've easily have seated 10, making it a great place to have lunch with a bunch of co-workers or perhaps a birthday celebration. 

The food was served very quickly. I'd ordered two of their rolls and one of them was pretty good but the other one had a strange after-taste that I didn't like at all. My in-laws were treating so I didn't want to make a fuss by sending it back so I just kinda forced it down LOL. I also thought the size of the rolls were pretty small. My wife enjoyed her rolls and her sake as well but it was my in-laws' food that was the best. They both ordered hibachi plates and let us try them and they were delicious! The meat and veggies were tender and it was all very tasty. If we visited Sake Express again I know what I'll be ordering for sure."}
{"text":"Dined here with a companion recently.

I ordered hibachi shrimp with broccoli and carrots. The food was tasty enough. Drinking sweet tea with my meal actually gave me enough food for two meals.

The decor was modern and interesting though I didn't care for the color scheme or the close fit of the tabled booths.  I also didn't like not being able to get my own drink.

All in all, I would return if I was in the mood for hibachi shrimp."}
{"text":"For the money best bargain in Gaston county. Food is always fresh and tasty, good service. The staff takes pride in their work and it shows."}
{"text":"By far the best restaurant to get lunch/dinner! Great service plus the food is always fresh! I love the sushi and steak+rice plate AND to top it off with their delicious shrimp sauce. I can't get enough of this place. The decor, the food and the employees! I'll give 6 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Went for dinner yesterday good food but not worth 33 for two plates I got the scallops and shrimp w broccoli and my gf had the chicken teriyaki good but didn't feel like it was work that much... Very friendly service"}
{"text":"This is my favorite fast food place in Gastonia. The food is very fresh and cooked to order. There are lots of selections from chicken ,steak, shrimp , and scallops with choices of sides. You can do combos ,too. My favorite is the scallop and filet low carb combo. I get the steak  med rare and shrimp sauce for the scallops. The scallops are the big ones ,too. I get broccoli to replace the rice.  Fast service inside and from drive through window. Very casual and very clean. Sometimes they offer a coupon on groupon."}
{"text":"4 stars.  very good sushi when u put in context both price and convenience of the experience.  cheaper than a full sit down experience without losing out on taste.   id come back again when im in the area and on the run.  btw good miso... and yes there is such a thing as bad miso.  - on my iphone on site"}
{"text":"Well, I'm not sure about the price rating.  This place is definitely more pricey than typical fast food.  That being said, I love this place.  The servings are adequate, the food is outstanding and the staff are very friendly. I will definitely come back on my next trip through NC!"}
{"text":"Love the idea of a drive thru that serves hibachi. It was pretty good I ordered hibachi chicken. It comes with mushrooms carrots and a shrimp sauce. I would check it out again."}
{"text":"I went here a couple times. So far I love the bagel roll and Philadelphia roll sushi.
Their hibachi chicken and vegetable trays are decent as well the carrots are the best part."}
{"text":"Sake Express is a great place for your hibachi fix. The food is always delicious as I usually order teriyaki steak or chicken. They also have lots of different choices on their menu even sushi. It is a place to try, I highly recommend it ."}
{"text":"The guy taking my order stared at me for 30 seconds without saying a word, no hello, no can I take your order. I finally told him what I wanted, he swiped my card and rudely told me to pull forward. When he brought my order out he stood and stared at me again for an uncomfortably long period (I'm assuming he was waiting for a tip), but because of his shitty customer service I just pulled away. I not only will never patronize this establishment again, I will not patronize any of the other Sake Expresses as they're owned by the same family. The food is very good, but I don't eat at places with rude employees."}
{"text":"I really like their food here, but their service is just not good. I stood in line and was ignored while others were greeted and then, when I finally got my order taken, I was told to find a seat and a server would be with me. There were no seats. I stood there for 5 minutes until a spot at a area opened up and waited another 10 minutes before I finally flagged down a \"server\" to actually get some help. As I write this. I'm still waiting on my food. I get that it's a busy Sunday lunch, but this is just bad service. Maybe add a hostess at the door for crowd control on a busy Sunday. Still no food yet."}
{"text":"Love this local chain for flavorful grilled meats and veggies. Yes they have the yummy, creamy \"shrimp white sauce!\" They offer a low carb option without the fried rice and sub in more squash, broccoli, carrot, mushroom,  and onion. The hibachi steak or chicken are my go to since the teriyaki is just additional sugar I don't need. There's other options like veggie only or shrimp, scallops, noodle bowls, kids meals, edamame, spring rolls, seaweed salad, and sushi. 

The interior design is modern and casual with fun colors and cool wood design. There's a fountain that kids love but it could use a good cleaning. Service is fast and friendly which is a good sign since it's tons of teenagers there must be a good manager involved."}
{"text":"This place is so incredibly hit-or-miss. We've had experiences where the food was under-cooked, had hair in our food, but then there have been times where it is delicious. I'm sure you'll wonder why we went back after finding hair in our food but there is NO WHERE to get decent Japanese like this in our area. Sake has multiple locations and this and Mount Holly are the only option. Lots of options elsewhere for sushi, but we like hibachi steak or chicken. All in all, the percentage of times we've had 'incidents' here is low, but each time it takes several months to get over."}
{"text":"I cannot express the level of \"I will never go there again\" that I feel about this place. I had eaten here no less than 50 times in my couple years of working in Gastonia before I visited and ended up with the worst food poisoning of my entire life. I was miserable for hours and hours. I felt like I was going to die from food poisoning. I know it was here because I took one bite of meat and could just tell that something was off, but thought maybe I got too much seasoning on that bite. No, they must have just had one bad steak that they cut up and tossed with some others and several of us ended up with bad pieces. It's been three years since then and I will just now go to the other Sake location but I will NEVER eat here again!!!!!"}
{"text":"LOVE Sake Express!! The place is always crowded, but service is still quick and delicious! I order either the Hibachi chicken or steak with mushrooms and the Spider rolls. One bite of the carrots, which come with an entree, and you will be hooked! You can dine in or take order to go thru drive thru. Meals are fairly inexpensive and the portions are good sized. Sake Express is on my must have restaurant list!"}
{"text":"I can't express how much I love the food here. They give you a great portion for the money you pay. Food is always consistent and the staff is very attentive!  I would definitely recommend Sake!"}
{"text":"Sake Express is a fast and convenient way to get your Japanese fix. From the sushi to the noodles to the low carb dishes, you can't go wrong with any of the menu choices."}
{"text":"Always busy and its understandable why: reasonable food within a short waiting time. Consistently good and friendly service."}
{"text":"They are always so nice. Specially Gail because she's nice and always serve me he best fish. I come here once a week after the gym because I'm a fatass. Well food is healthy if you play it smart. Ok I'm just rambling about a bunch non sense. Just shut up and come eat"}
{"text":"Food is always phenomenal. I love Japanese food and have been coming here for years. The cashiers are almost always rude but the waiters/waitresses are always so very friendly. Its cheap. Its delicious. Its always a great experience. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"While the food is great the customer service at this location sucks!  The young lady that was getting our drinks said sorry I am late I was in the bathroom.  Yup I wanted to know that.  Also she never came back and checked on us for drink refills or to see if we needed to go boxes.  In fact no one did.  However she did seem to enjoy eating her own meal at a table while doing something on her phone.  When we pulled up there were 4 staff sitting on the sidewalk on the side of the building and four more sitting at a table outside.  Must be this business pays its staff to sit around and do nothing.  Staff spent more time socializing with each other than they did the customers. I will not return to this location but will drive out of my way to go to Gastonia to eat in or the Mount Holly drive thru.  Bad customer service makes good food not worth having.  Wake up BELMONT SAKE!"}
{"text":"Ugh. Drive-thru is a clusterf**k.  Food mediocre.  They probably should get rid of their drive-thru.  It's not practical. 

The staff is friendly, though.  Poor employees try to make the situation better. 

Not worth the trouble."}
{"text":"As organized as they can be for the sheer volume of customers they always have! Only had one time I got the wrong order and they remade it and told me to keep the wrong order too ..the manager handled it very well! Awesome hibachi and sushi for a drive thru!!"}
{"text":"Food is consistent and never \"bad\" but they seem to be cutting their menu short during later dinner hours. I went this evening around 8:20 p.m. (they don't close until 9 p.m.) with hopes of having sushi for dinner. I was told that they had already cleaned the sushi station and were not taking sushi orders. WHATTTT. I mean, I could understand if I had pulled up at 8:50 and they said that, but there was almost a whole hour before they closed. Disappointed, but still hungry, I ordered the teriyaki shrimp and a sweet tea. The boy taking my order said they were out of sweet tea and not making any more tonight. Again, why not just keep everything stocked until the very end of the night. Guess if I want sushi and sweet tea I'll have to show up hours before closing next time"}
{"text":"Good, cheap, delicious sushi. Nothing super fancy or inventive going on here. They do have the basics for like $6 so not too shabby!!! Similar to what you'd get at a publix deli.

I will say some things are pricey. I got this fruity tuna salad that was a little pricey. The portions are a bit small but it's probably hard to get seafood out here in the middle of nowhere hahaha. So I was like okay 

I would recommend. I ordered takeout the service was extremely fast. No wait. Perfect for a person who wants to grab something fresh but not spend a bunch of money!!! I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"I travel a lot for work and good Japanese food is hard to come by. I found Sake express during a week in Gastonia and ate here 3 times that week! I go out of my way to eat here and get excited when my route puts me nearby! I highly recommend the hibachi chicken and mushrooms. I see people eating sushi a lot, so I assume it is good. This place is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty disappointed in this location. I called in an order and though my food is sitting there ready, I'm standing in a line of over 20 people just waiting to pay for it. They prioritize the drive thru but don't take care of their customers in line. There's one person brand new working the register and we've already been in line over 10 minutes with our food sitting there getting cold. I'm ready to leave without our food because of the horrible service."}
{"text":"Decent quality. A little over priced. Portions weren't very big. Also put off by seeing my waiter walk over to the hot water dispenser to make my soup. Expected better than that from a restaurant of that brand."}
{"text":"Last visit wasn't so great unfortunately. I had to wait in a long line to pay even though my food sat there ready and getting cold. I even told the guy at the front that I was picking up and he told me to wait. Food was bland and rice was barely cooked... much less fried rice. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"The food is always so delicious and fresh.  But the last few visits have not been as usual. Today the food was cold. The rice could be lifted in s block. Carrots were cold and the vegetables tepid. A disappointment. The wait staff was great. Thank you Savannah."}
{"text":"Delicious fresh food at great prices!  And quite a variety. If you haven't yet try the yakiniku steak!  Mmmm.  And nice friendly people and some of the sweetest waitstaff there are."}
{"text":"Had the privilege of stopping in for a lunch and was very pleased. I ordered a salad with some side order of steamed veggies. It was delivered in a very timely manner, and the food was very good.

The service at the cash register was excellent, the waitress staff was A plus excellent, Very attentive, and very cordial.

This location, Gastonia, seems to have everything working exactly the way that it should. The gals that on this place, the family, should be very proud of whatThey have been able to accomplish.

This will be one of our to go places in the near future."}
{"text":"Gastonia is where I grew up...I've known it as a biscuit and BBQ town.
There is nothing wrong with that...just sayin that typically comfort food, traditionally sells better.

Me & James stopped in on a Friday evening soon after our flight arrival from DC.
By 730p the place is jammed. It get's a bit chaotic trying to get into the parking lot with so
many people trying to get into the drive-thru.

I had the shrimp & rice...meeh...just OK, not much flavor really."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times back when I lived in the area. The food never disappoints. It's always fresh, seasoned correctly, hot. Just what you would look for in a typical hibachi restaurant. Last night was as awesome as I remembered! The only downfall was they didn't have any fried rice or sushi since we came close to closing. Everyone who works in there is sweet. Overall enjoyed my shrimp hibachi and boyfriend enjoyed his chicken/steak hibachi."}
