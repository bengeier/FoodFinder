{"text":"A nice place to go for lunch Summer or Winter to watch the the river and the Chambly Fort while having a nice Portuguese \"Bistro\" food. Excellent appetizers to choose from  and good solid main dishes.  I had some excellent snails with a basil/cream sauce and a bavette with a smoked sweet pepper sauce. Fries are excellent too ! In the evening tapas are a great choice."}
{"text":"We decided to visit Chambly and the surrounding area in November. Apparently Chambly is mostly closed in November - who knew.   This cozy and inviting restaurant was both open and able to accommodate us for a late lunch at a delightful little table by the window overlooking the basin. The appetizers of beet soup and salad were delicious and the fish and Portuguese sampler hit the spot on a cold day.   The staff were very nice and we thoroughly enjoyed our lunch looking out at the view!"}
{"text":"The prices and portions were fantastic.  I had the grilled octopus, which I believe was $8 and I have easily paid $18-$21 for the same exact presentation elsewhere.  I also had the sardines entree, which was a bit shocking; 4 HUGE fish and generous portion of rice (saffron I believe), maybe around $21.  My date ordered the Portuguese chicken and said it was the best chicken dish he's had.  The sausage tapas was also inexpensive and easily 2-3 times the portion size I've had else where and served with a great spicy mustard.  I am looking forward to going back to this place soon.  The outside terrace was also great. Hand cut fries."}
