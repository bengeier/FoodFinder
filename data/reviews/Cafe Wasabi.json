{"text":"Cafe Wasabi is great place to go get some great sushi at reasonable prices.  The atmosphere is nothing special. Quite simple really.  The sushi is great though.  They have same unique rolls and the price is very reasonable. The Wasabi roll is my favorite and only $6. They don't have a happy that i'm aware which is a bit of a bummer.  I  highly recommend Cafe Wasabi."}
{"text":"Two words: food poisoning.   I live really close to Cafe Wasabi, and I had heard good things about the restaurant from friends, so I was hoping CW could be my go-to neighborhood sushi place. My boyfriend and I ventured over one weeknight and found the dining area relatively empty. Undeterred, we ordered several rolls, all of which were fine, if somewhat lacking in actual fish.   Leaving the restaurant, I was content. The food was decent but not spectacular, and it was relatively inexpensive. However, my boyfriend became pretty sick later that night, and that sealed the deal. No return trip for us."}
{"text":"I'll get straight to the point. Got a $25 off restaurant.com voucher. Pro: The restaurant is very clean, you won't get sick eating here. Health inspection is an A. Sushi and the food's presentation looks great! Extremely short wait times, the moment you ordered, the food came out shortly after. Paying special notes to the vegetables, its very fresh. Wasabi is extremely spicy compared to other restaurants offering wasabi.  Cons: Not a full service restaurant but charges required 18% tip. No customer service, no drink refills or anything like that. Food was okay, it's a tad overpriced. Ordered a few plates of food. It's a tad bland."}
{"text":"I went there with coupon from restaurant.com. As soon as the cashier(older lady) saw that she gave me attitude. She's not friendly more of the mean side, never smile. It seems like she doesn't care about customer at all. The food was alright not the best. The sushi rolls had lots of rice, just a little of fish. The service was very poor. She didn't even say thank you. By the way she charged me 18% gratuity for my take out order."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner there last evening. The rolls were good, we waited for our beer, and then my husband went up and asked for it. We were a bit shocked by the 18% gratuity included in with the total when we stood at the counter and ordered our food. The service was fair definitely not worth the 18%, it was nice, but we will continue going to our usual sushi place. This place was a bit pricey for the service that we received. I have NEVER  been served Miso soup from a normal coffee cup before last night. Definitely wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Recession of '08 has another victim.  Cafe Wasabi is closed.  This is the second time in a month that I've gone to a restaurant with good yelp reviews, only to find that the restaurant is gone, kaput, out of business."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I purchased a coupon off restaurants.com and decided to give it a shot after some pretty nasty reviews on yelp!  We got 3 rolls, bulgogi & teriyaki chicken and it was awesome! The rolls were normal size and tasted great!  If you get a coupon off restaurants.com its pretty good."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough. Very clean and hospitable. The music is great and at a volume to carry on a conversation. The menu is varied with a lot of new dishes I have never tried before. Great place to take a date or \"roll\" to on your own."}
{"text":"First time customers. My husband and I ate here for dinner last night. We had a $25 certificate from restaurants.com. Fist impressions of the place was that it is clean, modern in decor and has a large menu selection. We ordered two rolls, one order tuna sashimi and the kirin sake bomber special. The sashimi was okay. Plating was clean and the color / appearance of the tuna was nice. The portion size and cut was adequate. However it lacked the flavor and texture that I'm used to. I'm not sure if that is because the quality was substandard or not. The rolls were pretty much the same way. The presentation was nice but the flavor was lacking. The chairs at the main table were very uncomfortable. Service was attentive and friendly. Overall it was okay. I think I would rather go somewhere else though and have a more flavorful experience."}
{"text":"i really dig this place for its uniqueness and the sushi.  you'll find several one-of-a-kind sushi recipes here, and so far I've found them all to be delicious.  when your sushi is served, you can tell right away that the people preparing it care.  it looks beautiful and the taste matches.  no fishy smell at this place, either -- a big plus for a sushi bar, imo.  definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The sushi is some of the best sushi I've had in Phoenix.  The restaurant is pretty small and narrow, but clean, modern/trendy.  They don't have a bar, but some beers (and possibly wine, I've never checked).  It's a great place to take a date or friend.  Not really suited for big groups. I probably go here twice a month.  It's my little token sushi place.   The only negative comment I have is that they do not do happy hour."}
{"text":"Good sushi at a reasonable price.  Their sake bombers are always cheap, they have a great selection of rolls, noodles, and soup (and awesome seaweed salad!).  Service is excellent, fast and courteous.  Damn, now i'm hungry."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times with friends and again with my daughter. The food is godo for the price. It's not stand on your head spectacular but we've enjoyed it. We have never had to wait long to get our order.  The staff has always been very friendly and have always been attentive to our needs. The restaurant is always very clean.   We'll be going back again very soon."}
{"text":"Today actually was my 2nd visit to Cafe Wasabi, the place is pretty interesting. Nice decor, small, with a BIG selection of rolls. (they have pictures of all of their rolls and rice dishes in store) They are not the 'normal' Japanese restaurant you visited, but more of a mixture of different kinds of foods, Japanese and Korean are the main kinds, then they have a small selection of sandwiches and even panini (Italian??), salads, and sake. (that's why it's called Cafe? )  You pay right after ordering, like in a fast food restaurant, then go fill your own fountain drink, seat, they'll bring the food to you. I've tried the Grand Canyon roll, the Unagi Crunch roll, and the Udon. The food actually taste good, not that spectacular, but with the price I'm paying, I'm not about to complain!  I think this could be a place for your casual lunch/dinner with friends, cheap price, but decent food!"}
{"text":"They are a little expensive, but the sushi is first rate. Try the Sakitinis, they're ground up Jolly Ranchers with Vodka. Mmmmmm."}
{"text":"I work really near this cafe and eat there a couple times a month usually, I love that it is a \"mom and pop\" type of restaurant; the family that owns it are always extremely happy, gracious, and friendly.  The prices are great, I usually get the Flying High special which has a LARGE Dragon Roll and a yummy salad with avocado and a great dressing.  The green tea is also fantasic.  The decor is cute and bright!"}
{"text":"marginal sushi meets uncomfotable seating.  we used restaurant.com coupon and got stuck wtih an 18% tip...with no service, seriously???  felt scammed...think we actually spent more based on that tip than had we just paid full price.  avoid this one, just not worth it."}
{"text":"What a delightful little place! This new restaurant on the Southeast corner of Southern and McClintock has an ambience and class that are much too rare in Tempe. Tasty (and affordable) sushi and sandwiches in a lounge-type atmosphere that is modern and refreshing. We need more like this!"}
{"text":"The lady behind the register was so rude. First of all you order And pay at the register before u sit down. She had an attitude and kept asking us if we were ready yet upon looking over the menu. This was in the morning and she only had 1 order of Gyoza left which she reheated in the microwave and proceeded to pick stuff off of each peice with her bare hands while scratching her head. He cancelled that order quick. Sushi was ok. Imitation meat I've had better and cheaper. Soda machines were down. Had a $15 off coupons rom restaurant.com but they charged us $8 extra for gratuity using the coupon lol only 3 of us ate. Will not be going back"}
{"text":"I have been frequenting Cafe Wasabi since they opened maybe 5 years ago.  After my last experience, I don't think I'll go back.  My sister got me a restaurant.com gift certificate.  I thought it would be an opportunity to try more expensive rolls.  When I pointed out that the coupon did not indicate that drinks were not included in the the $35 minimum (simply to inform her in case she wanted to change the coupon's terms), the female manager told me to \"talk to restaurant.com\".  Plus, the 18% gratuity is ridiculous considering that they provide no service beyond bringing your rolls to you.  You serve your own drinks.  And they charged the 18% gratuity on our whole purchase, not just the food for the coupon.  This is simply an attempt to earn back what they're losing from this \"amazing\" coupon.  After this experience, with such poor service, I don't think that I'll return in the future, which is sad because their food is pretty tasty.  Cafe Wasabi...either treat your customers with some kindness and respect or take down the \"People Like Us On yelp\" sticker from your door."}
{"text":"expensive   but the best sushi in town  try the screaming orgasm  and the sushi taco  dirty, i know but the fish is first rate  and sit at the bar!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I just got a job teaching less than a mile from this little restaurant and I was THRILLED to discover it today!  Walking through the door, the place looks rather cramped: 1 four-top, 3 two-tops, and a long counter with about 10 seats on each side. The woman at the counter was polite, though not overly friendly.  I ordered a salmon salad and spicy tuna roll combo with an iced green tea (drinks were self-serve; take-out cup was provided at no extra charge). My salad was served in less than five minutes and I had not finished it when the roll came out.  The tea was freshly brewed and they had three different types to choose from, which made me happy.  My salad was nothing exciting, although the dressing tasted homemade and all the ingredients were very fresh (pet peeve: sifting through my salad for brown lettuce). What really sold me on the place, though, was the sushi. Spicy tuna is generally bland and unexciting, plus the fish is overworked... It's sort of a training bra for people who are not quite ready for real raw fish, but who have graduated from California rolls.  This, though, was perfect: the tuna was minced, but still cold and not pulpy; the spice came from raw jalapenos; and they added some cucumber slices, a really nice touch.  The restaurant looked very clean; tables were bused very promptly and were set up appealingly for the next customers. The woman at the counter stopped her conversation immediately when I approached to ask for more wasabi, and all of the employees said goodbye when I left. I will DEFINITELY be back to Cafe Wasabi."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! their sushi is delicious, the people are nice. i love the communal table- we always see friends there."}
{"text":"Via Yelp, tried their made to order buffet....just yummy!!!  Daily buffet starts at 8:30 pm and they have quite a selection of appetizers, sushi, rolls and entries.  We kept to the sushi cuz allowed us to try more.  The jalapeño tuna and the tourched scallops were excellent.  The presentation on the poki tuna was wonderful and delicious.   To top it off, you had to try their mango mocho and green tea ice cream.  You get to choose from the menu, made to order and eat til you're stuffed..hard to beat!"}
{"text":"Around the corner and down the road from my new place is the bestest sushi place!! Very mom and pop... if mom and pop were into lime green and sleek contemporary decor. Very clean and kinda ackwardly set up, Cafe Wasabi reminds me of Subway... except this is really fresh!   I've had the Hawaiian Roll and the Rainbow Roll - both were really good as was the Orange shrimp roll. The nigiri is good - but then again, nigiri is always good. :) Along the counter's sneeze guard are pictures and descriptions of the various rolls available. Some look too exotic to try and others are regular standbys. I can see first timers getting squeemish when they see them on display. One cool touch is the maaaany empty sake bottles that are decorated by the lucky souls that drank them. I have yet to try one myself - but the bottles on the shelves and counter sure look cute.  The sushi is good, I never had any stomach problems after eating there and I always leave there happy I came and promising myself that next time I'll try the green tea ice cream... i would - but I'm always too full!!"}
{"text":"Super uncomfortable seating. Small and cramped. Average food. Small portions."}
{"text":"We went here after buying a restaraunts.com gift certificate which was good for $35 as long as you spent $25. There were no restrictions listed on the gift card. Our order came to about $33 (sushi and food alone) so we wanted to add on saki bombs which would of been at least $10 more. The owner said NO and didn't care that the coupon was good for drinks. He just complained to us how he doesn't make any money on those restaraunt.com gift certificates. So instead of us adding $10 extra dollars we had to  just find something cheap to make the $35. The owner, who could of made alot more money, ended up losing that extra cash and us as customers. I would think if someone is coming in for the first time with a gift card they purchased online they would try to make the experience enjoyable, since, the reason for these gift cards is to get new customers to come in and keep them coming in. I will NEVER go back. The owner and his wife were very rude to us and the food was just mediocre. There are definetly better sushi places in the area for the same price."}
{"text":"Had a bizarre and horrible experience here the other night. I went for sushi with a friend about an hour and a half before they're supposed to close, on a Friday night. When we stepped in there was no one to greet us, and all the unoccupied seats were yet to be bussed with dirty dishes everywhere. We figured they might be playing catch up, so we sat down on a couch waiting for a spot to open. Another couple came in and went to the counter, where they had their order taken. We got up and followed their lead, but once we had decided what we wanted we stood at the register for over 5 minutes before a person making rolls behind the counter told us they were \"very busy\" and any food we ordered would probably take more than an hour. This was after we had been milling about the restaurant waiting for a hint of service for almost 30 minutes, before essentially being turned away. Maybe the food is as good as the other reviewers say, but it's not worth fighting for the staff's attention before being rudely denied service."}
{"text":"I have given this place 3 tries and they just suck.   It is expensive paper thin average fish and no personality.   Save your time and money.  Go anywhere but here."}
{"text":"Ok so the only time i come here is with a restaurant.com certificate.. Good deal usually.  The total comes down from $35-50 to $15-25...depending on group size (i'm usually there with 3-5 ppl) not bad, yes it is kinda weird they have you tip 18% there...only because there is no service to tip. You pay and order at the counter..  oh well the sushi maker needs it.   The food is great, I always order water everywhere i go, so can't comment on drinks. Oh the green tea sorbet or icecream is yummy! its served in a bowl with 3 scoops, good for up to 4 people maybe..  Yes and the decor gets kind of boring after awhile......kinda like a clean institution? ikea, ikea, ikea..............  But yeah try it out:)  oh and its a pretty small place, not that good for groups.. they have one long table in the middle and a few tables around.."}
{"text":"NOTE: Cafe Wasabi only gets four stars if you keep it simple. Stick with the fundamentals and stay out of the more...interesting rolls and you will get great value for money.  No nonsense, decent quality, decent speed. I actually like the place most because it treats sushi like what sushi is supposed to be: a convenient, simple finger food. Too many Americanized sushi places dress up the rolls and the experience too much - and charge for the unnecessary embellishment."}
{"text":"I've gone here since they opened as I live in the neighborhoods.  Quality & service continues to decline. Called tonight at 8:27 (Friday with posted hrs to 9pm ) & guy answering said kitchen closed at 8:30. I informed him that it was 8:27. I will never go back. I will drive to downtown phoenix to Harumi sushi. Much better quality. Worth the drive."}
{"text":"I was the only early-afternoon customer when I visited. I got prompt, positive service and a very tasty salmon roll at a fair price."}
{"text":"My friends and I met up here. Their idea.  I thought I had found the best sushi I could find in town. This place surprised me!  The decor is cute, the sushi bar is very nice. It felt like everyone in there was happy/pleased and it had to do with the fact that they were there and having an excellent time.  Besides the excellent sushi, I thought that the sushi chefs had great personalities. Sometimes you have excellent food and the staff is just LAME. These guys were talking, commenting on the stuff on TV, laughing, still very attentive, giving sushi suggestions (good ones at that) and were having drinks and saying \"KANPAIIII!!!\" and clinking glasses with us. Rolls were made quickly and nicely. Very nice place. Don't hesitate to try it out!"}
{"text":"Got a coupon for this place from restaurant.com - sucks they add an 18% gratuity but I knew that going into it.  I just thought there'd be table service so didn't mind including the tip.  Here, you order at the counter then they bring your food to you but thats all the service there is.  They don't come back and see how you're doing or anything - meh.  We ordered shrimp tempura roll, california roll, tootsie roll and caterpillar roll.  The sushi was pretty good and I've decided tootsie roll is my new fave.  The decor was modern and sleek and very clean.  I love that they have great pictures of all the rolls with the names - something I think all sushi places should do."}
{"text":"This place is kind of lame, honestly.  It has a lot of potential, and it's pretty cute and bright and colorful inside. But the food is just not good. The one time I ate here, I had a shrimp tempura roll and something else that I can't remember. The tempura was awful! I'm pretty sure it had been fried hours before I even walked into the restaurant. The crunch-less texture was a total giveaway.  There are so many other better, cheaper sushi places in Tempe. Don't even bother with this one."}
{"text":"Eeehhh, it was just mediocre. My brother and I went here when he was in town. He liked his rolls, I wasn't crazy about mine. The rolls I got just weren't great tasting, and they were way too big.   I am not sure if anyone knows what I am talking about, but I hate it when rolls are too big. I like a nice bite size roll. Nothing is worse than when you can not eat a roll in one piece. Rolls were not meant to be eaten in pieces. Nothing is worse than putting a roll in your mouth and barely being able to chew it, because it is so big. Maybe these places think Americans like everything bigger and are trying to accommodate us?  My brother lives in a really small town and doesn't  experience a lot of sushi, so his standards are slightly lower than mine. I definitely will not be seeking out this place, and will only go back if I have to."}
{"text":"We went here for dinner and ordered several rolls and edamame for dinner.  All of the rolls were fantastic and the prices are great.  The only downside to this restaurant were the chairs.  They are painful to sit in and all four of us were extremely uncomfortable... we contemplated standing up for dinner. Groups of two can sit along the wall in the acrylic chairs and have a better chair experience."}
{"text":"The spicy yellowtail roll was decent, the lunch special baked salmon wasn't good. The salAd was weak sauce.. Restaurant is too quiet n the service could've been more enjoyable.. I'd go somewhere else next time I crave sushi"}
{"text":"I'm always up for a good sushi night, and with Cafe Wasabi so close to home, I tend to go there frequently.    The inside is fairly small, but it is decorated nicely.  It has a contemporary feel which is different from most other sushi restaurants I go to.  I usually order the dragon roll and the spicy tuna roll which I always enjoy.  The service is quick and the food is worth it.    The price is also cheap compared to your typical sushi bar.  I would certainly recommend it to fellow sushi-lovers."}
{"text":"In the 11 years I have worked in this part of Tempe, I have seen quite a few restaurants in the current location of Cafe Wasabi. In fact, I only knew it was there when I invited a former student of mine to lunch and this was her suggestion. My husband and I have been perpetually disgusted by the quality of the seafood in the valley, with the notable exception of PF Chang's scallops. The freshness of this sushi was impressive and is far, far better than the fancy sushi places in town like Ra. The rolls are not only delicious, but absolutely beautiful- they look just like the pictures. Prices were reasonable for the quality, and the place was impeccably clean, with a slightly modern, industrial feel. I will be back for lunch for sure and will make a special trip from CenPho with hubby."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a gambler, but when I saw this place open up I thought, \"why not.\" I'll save you from having to ask yourself this by telling you that the food is not good. I ordered a salad and a Las Vegas roll and the salad just never came out. I kept expecting it before my sushi (which I had to choke down), and finally I had to go ask for it. The staff did feel bad, but the place was COMPLETELY EMPTY.  I won't be visiting Cafe Wasabi again."}
{"text":"No good. At all. Prices are awful. 1 star for the piped wasabi."}
{"text":"This was one of the better sushi experiences I've had in Arizona. The pricing is very reasonable, the fish quality was excellent, and they seem to play jazz over the stereo, as opposed to the usual techno in most sushi joints.  It looks like it would be a good lunch place. There's no happy hour, no bar, and the alcohol selection is pretty much limited to beer and hot or cold sake.  By the way, I'm not the greenest person by any means (I'm eating sushi after all), but what's up with that take-out packaging? It seems like an overwhelming amount of styrofoam and plastic bags for the amount of food that was in it."}
{"text":"I love Cafe Wasabi because it's where I go to eat when I can't think of anywhere to eat. I wouldn't choose this restaurant if I wanted a swanky sushi experience, but it does have its own virtues. It's very quiet and clean inside, the staff doesn't bother with small talk (I'm in the restaurant business, so when I eat out in my free time the last thing I want to do is bs with people) and the food is straight-forward, no frills, Americanized sushi. Also, the prices are amazing. I'm a big fan of the combos that include a roll and a salad- perfectly light in the middle of the day."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here last night (Thursday) at about 7pm.  The place was pretty dead which was good because I don't like crowds or waiting a long time for my food.  The decor of the place is pretty much how all the other reviews on here describe it.  It really is a neat little \"sushi cafe\".  I didn't much like the ordering process but I guess that is where the \"cafe\" part comes in.  You aren't seated, given a menu, then free to check little boxes on a piece of paper to let them know what sushi you want.  Instead, you walk up to the counter, look at a menu, and give your order right there.  I felt rushed to give my order as if somebody was behind me waiting to place theirs but there wasn't.  Our cashier/waitress was very nice and patient though.  *Sake Bomber = solid and not bad for $6  *Octopus Salad = gross and I couldn't eat it.  I was expecting something like what they have at RA but it was far from it.  Instead, it was slices of octopus that tasted super fishy and really nasty.  *Edamame = standard  *4 random rolls = pretty good but not outstanding.  We didn't order any crazy rolls though.  I still think Ra/Kona are much better for some reason.  I guess its because I think the fish is fresher at the larger more popular places.  I'm really not the biggest fan of strip-mall sushi places, but the sushi here was ok and not bad at all.   Anyway, I wasn't expecting this place to be as decent as it was.  I'm not sure I am going to rush back though.  However, if I lived across the street I would be there all the time.  We used a $25 Restaurant.com gift certificate we got for like $5 or something so it wasn't a bad deal.  I would highly recommend giving this place a shot but get one of those certificates first.  Oh, and with the certificate they add an additional 18% gratuity which is a bit weird because you wouldn't think you get service because you order everything at the counter.  You actually DO get service because the cashier/waitress brings you your food, clears your plates, and does the other stuff that standard waitresses do, so they deserve a tip."}
{"text":"We were also one of the customers who used the restaurant.com coupon. I had been to this place once before and thought it ok enough to return. Both myself and my daughter love salmon sashimi so we ordered it as usual. What they placed on our table was NOT salmon sashimi. It had the look and texture of smoked salmon. We brought it to the attention of the staff. Unbelieveable that they truly believed it was how it was supposed to look. I've had more than my fair share over the years and have never come across such stupidity. How can you serve sashimi to people that has been cooked and is obviously not RAW? So the guy took it back and brought out another serving of the same exact thing. Same conversation again. I finally had him take it back and got the tuna instead which I didn't want but was ok. I can't walk into the place again knowing that their sushi chef can't tell the difference... it's embarrassing for them. Even before the food was served my three year old knocked over a small cup of water. Not one single person on the staff... who by the way weren't doing anything but talking behind the counter, made an attempt to offer us a towel to wipe it from the table or the floor. We tried to get their attention but they ignored us. We finally got up and grabbed towels to clean it up... only when we did this did they take notice.   I will never go back to this place."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place, based on my two visits here. Me and the lady feel like it's our own little joint since we've been the only ones there both times we've gone.  All the rolls have been great. As you stand in line to order, they have color pictures of all the rolls so you can see exactly what you're getting. I've had the Vegas, sushi burro, tuna roll, cucumber roll, love roll, and one or two other I can't remember the names of, and they have all been great. Fresh, tasty, flavorful....good times. All the prices are reasonable too, as some other reviews mentioned. You won't get that look on your face like \"I paid $9 for this?\" which seems to happen with sushi sometimes. And we had soybeans and one of the salads which had a great dressing on it.  They have a small but good beer selection. Sake bombers are $6 all day which is a price normally found only at happy hour at other places. They advertise the $6 bombers with Kirin, but I get Asahi and I believe they give me the same price. Plus you get to choose hot or cold sake.  I like the interior design. Nice, clean, and modern but not trendy to the point of being cheesy. Plus I love how people can sign and decorate their sake bottles and they have them all on display. I'm secretly jealous that I haven't done it, but I get hot sake which doesn't come in the green bottles.  All in all I'm a big fan of Cafe Wasabi and will try and make it whenever I'm craving sushi. I don't know how busy they are on weekends or later in the evening. I've gone around 5-6ish on weekdays both times and we've been the only ones dining in. I hope they're usually busier than that because I'd hate to see the place go out of business.  One more note: Closed on Sundays! That's maybe the only negative I can find."}
{"text":"SOOOOOOO disappointed.   Was out with a friend and we were CRAVING sushi. Went to Sushi 101 (Rural and University, Awesome and Fresh) but it was packed, so decided to try Cafe Wasabi -- looked cute, bright, and clean. LOOKED clean -- from the outside.   We were originally a bit impressed -- they seemed to have a wide selection of interesting and different rolls. Everything seemed a bit expensive, but we're used to the happy hour pricing at 101. We decided to splurge. We ordered at the counter and paid (and tipped) up front. We ordered four rolls and miso soup -- we were hungry! The miso soup came first, and was disappointing. Bland, thin, and a very small portion for $1.50 -- it filled less than half a (small) coffee cup!   The rolls came and looked great -- presentation was definitely good. At first taste, though, our faces fell. They were bland, kept falling apart, and didn't taste fresh at all.   THEN, a nightmare! I found a hair in the cream-cheese garnish on my roll! SO gross. Friend took it up to the counter to complain, and they DID apologize, sort of, but didn't offer to refund our money. We both agreed that if we hadn't paid up front we would have demanded they take it off of our bill. After that, my appetite was gone, so after sitting for a solid 10 minutes to give them ample time to approach us, we left four barely-eaten rolls on the table and walked out.   Overall, even without the hair in my cream cheese, I probably wouldn't have gone back -- the food just wasn't that good.  Good luck if you're thinking about trying it out..."}
{"text":"Cafe Wasabi is super close to where I live and family owned. The people aren't the nicest, and you can feel a little nervous under their watch. But the best part about a family owned place like that is the delicious food. I don't particularly like their salads, but for any roll with eel, this place is unbeatable. The teriyaki is decent, but their udon and street vendor style chicken on a stick is to die for. It's a small place, and the atmosphere is laid back. Great place for a second date or a nice lunch with friends."}
{"text":"Great food a little bit pricy and uncomfortable seats.  My youngest always gets the classic California Roll my oldest gets the Dragon Roll."}
{"text":"This place is interesting.  They have a really large sushi roll menu, (with pictures) which is cool. But they also are home to some wierd sandwhiches such as cheese steaks and paninis.  Wierd, i know.  My friend and I tried the ahi salad, edamame, spicy tuna roll, and one other roll that the name has since faded from my memory.  The salad was great and the edamame came in a large portion, yay! Both rolls were really good as well.  Spicy tuna is hard to mess up but the other roll which was more complicated was tasty, it had a hint of orange. Lovely."}
{"text":"Would've given more stars, but the last couple of times I've been here it's been dirty. Last time, a whole table where kids had obviously been had been abandoned by the customers but was still cluttered with dishes, rice and sauces smeared everywhere, stuff on the floor, and...  ...while I was getting my drink at the self-serve fountain, I stepped in a puddle near this table.  I just removed one star, remembering how gross I felt as my jeans sopped up some mysterious liquid from the floor. And I remember very well how gross it was to have to look at that table, because staff didn't clear it/clean it.  It sat. And sat. Throughout my whole meal. And we were one of two parties in the venue. It really wouldn't have been hard. But I suppose cleanliness isn't that much of a concern, as I've seen the same cashier ring up a customer, bring a plate of food to another table, sit down at a table in the same dining area as the customers, stuff some food into her face, get up when another customer enters the cafe, and take that person's order. While she still is chewing the food in her mouth.  What surprises be about all of this is that I was intending to give a 3.5-ish star review, because for AZ and the price, this sushi menu is pretty decent. But all I could think of when I started to type this summary was the messy tables I've had to look at as I eat, the cashier gnawing away as she handles cash, and the time I was here and our order took forever...and I complained...and was met with a sour-faced scorn and not a single effort to remedy the situation.  Given my disdain for dirtiness and ineptitude when it comes to where I eat, I really should be giving this place a 1-star. But their Shrimp Tempura rolls are good. The udon is ok. They have seaweed salad (called 'Ocean Salad' on their menu) which I love. Their raw selections often have no taste...like the Rainbow roll, which incorporates raw tuna, because it's not fresh and cut from frozen fish. But it's not fishy. I like the green iced tea. Their prices really are decent overall.  So I think it's worth a try if you like sushi without pretention. The atmosphere is that of an Ikea showroom, because it pretty much is.   ====UPDATE 6/20/08====ONE STAR ADDED; UPPED TO 3====  Why? And why aren't you using the new update feature Elle?  First things first. I think the owners of Wasabi read Yelp, because they have been cleaner the last few times I've been. And no chewing servers. Granted, I haven't gone during peak hours in those last few visits, but let me give them the benefit of the doubt and grant them the extra star because I do keep going back. However, if I notice more of the rankness I'll take them back down again, adjusting this review so incessantly it will soon complain of schitzo-affective disorder.  Oh yeah, and why don't I use the new feature? Because I don't want to."}
{"text":"This isn't bad sushi, not by long shot. The place is clean as well, and you're not going to get sick here. That said. This is not $$ sushi.  It's nothing write home about. Again, not bad, but it's not great, it's just good. I'm sure they would argue that you're paying for the cleanliness and atmosphere. But even then it doesn't warrant the prices. Would I recommend it? Not likely. Will I come back? Probably.  If it was a tad bit cheaper it'd earn itself another star. So it's almost there, but not quite."}
{"text":"Got a restaurant.com coupon so decided to try this place. The restaurant is small with a long common table down the middle and a few two tops on the side.  The best part of the meal was the squid salad appetizer. Good portion and tasty. Things went south from there.  The rice for the sushi was very bland. The yellowtail sashimi was a major rip off. Fish was frozen and such a tiny portion for the price. Their namesake roll, the wasabi roll had this really funky tasting sauce on it. I don't know what it was but just left a horrible aftertaste."}
{"text":"mostly a rip off. but it's not their fault...entirely. we too had a restaurant.com coupon and yes, still wound up paying 22 bucks for 2 rolls, 2 sashimi, and an octopus salad.  yes, the decor is cool (all ikea...they left the stickers on everything). but the sushi is barely average. way better and way cheaper at sapporo, ra, pearl, geisha happy hours.  what miffed us the most was the 18% gratuity. sure, we know it's the coupons' fault for adding that, but paying that much gratuity for \"counter order\" food and not a single follow-up from the staff is absolutely ridiculous.  glad this place is more than 5 miles from us so we won't consider it again."}
{"text":"We used the Restaurant.com $25 off of $35 or more... and I still paid over $20 for 1 salad, 1 cup of miso, 3 rolls, 2 iced teas. The beverages were not included in the deal. 18% gratuity (for what?). For $6 more I could have gone to my regular place and got 5 big rolls with lots of fish in them, 2 large bowls of miso, 2 home made iced green teas, and a real sit-down service... I'd not go back to Cafe Wasabi, there was nothing compelling about this place - at all.  Food Quality: 2/5 barely average  Food Quantity: 2/5 below average - not much fish in the rolls, what I can easily call slivers of fish on top of rolls.  Food Flavor: 2/5 barely average, nothing great.  Food Selection: 2/5 below average, they had very few fish types and most rolls had the same stuff in it, just with different sauces. big woop. No nigiri, no handrolls - and they had regular sandwiches... really!?  Decor & Service : 2/5 below average, \"Cafe\" is a good way to describe this place's decor, style, and ordering method. I did not care for it at all."}
{"text":"When we pulled up we had doubts but decided to be open minded,To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. The service was beyond horrible. Staff was some of the most unfriendly people I have ever encountered. The food took a unreasonably long time to come out and was under par to say the least. Let's just say that if I was offered a free meal here I would kindly reject. Save your money and time and skip out on cafe wasabi."}
{"text":"I have been a customer for over 2 years now, since moving down the street. I have always had great service and the sushi has always been wonderful. There are several other sushi spots in the area, but few of them stack up to Cafe Wasabi. The place is small and sometimes crowded but that has never deterred me from going there."}
{"text":"I had the same problem as other people. I got a coupon off of restaurants.com to get a free $25 even after the free $25 I still had to pay $60 which is crazy because thats really expensive for food. The ordering is at the counter and then you sit down to eat so 18% gratuity is a little outrageous. Also, it said on the coupon that drinks could not make your minimum order, however, the gratuity is added after your drinks.   Besides the whole money issue the sushi wasn't even that good. I didn't care for the food regardless of the price. I will not go back to this place."}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant a handful of times over the last 7 years.  I have always enjoyed it because it's clean, small and not loud.  The sushi is consistently good and they have a great selection. I have two complaints: first,  the staff has no personality.  They don't make an effort to interact with you and make you feel welcome.  Second, it's a little pricey.  I was recently there with my 4 year old and she enjoyed it very much.  We will most likely keep going back until we find another small sushi place to go to."}
{"text":"I am a lover, but I also have to be honest.  First off, I give restaurants a chance to make me a satisfied customer before I type up a negative missive.  That being said...I love sushi, I enjoy a fresh and inventive roll, know what good sushi grade meat tastes like, and will even spend extra on some good Toro.  I have been to this establishment twice because it is minutes away from home (and an extra incentive was the ubiquitous Restaurant.com certificate.)  A great piece of marketing for this little sushi place, but I don't feel that they have taken the feedback to heart.  Cons:    Unfriendly staff.  I was almost afraid to tell the lady at the counter that the Dynamite Roll tasted like baked dog food.  Upon doing so, but with a more candid and diplomatic approach, my suspicions were confirmed that my feedback would not be welcomed.  I received no eye contact, a sneer, but an offer to let me order another roll.  No apologies, definitely no smiles, and certainly no questions to ascertain the root of the issue.  No one came to the table to follow up on our orders, to ask if we were enjoying the food, or to offer refills.  So what was the 18% gratuity for that was automatically added to the bill?  When we left the restaurant both staff members were nowhere to be seen, maybe they wanted to avoid thanking us for coming in.  Despite the certificate we had, we still spent over $60 there.  Every roll seems to have imitation crab meat, and the sushi grade is sub-par.  We sampled about six different rolls.  Quite frankly the best one was the passion fruit kiwi roll, which only had about four ingredients.  Even a baked shrimp and eel roll that was ordered had imitation crab meat.  Too much rice, not enough ingredients, and they definitely skimped on the sushi.  A $12 order of yellow tail sashimi was also disappointing, as the meat was a cut which none of us had ever seen before.  It certainly did not taste like what we were used to, and we spoke up about it.  The response was that this was just a different cut and it was all they had.  Really?!  Pros:   Prices are reasonable, average roll is $8.  Cafe style so you order at the counter  and your meal is delivered to table.  ***  There are so many wonderful sushi restaurants in the valley, dozens in that area, and I strongly believe that if you want to stay in business as a restaurant you have to offer something unique.  Whether it is the freshness and flavor of your food, or the incredible service that you offer.  Take \"Sakana\" for instance.  The moment you enter or leave their establishment, the entire staff greets you in Japanese.  You feel like an old friend stopping in for a visit.  Not to mention they have some of the best yellowtail sashimi, and they are generous with the portions.  Unfortunately we will never come back here.  The food is lacking in personality about as much as the staff's."}
{"text":"At the time we visited this place it was not busy, yet our sushi were made fresh with what tasted like fresh ingredients.  It's more like your fast food type of place.  It is nicely decorated and the service were friendly.  Our order : Teriyaki Salmon Philly Roll Volcano Roll Unage Crunch Roll  If we were in the area and in the mood for sushi we would visit again.  I can't remember all that we ordered but check out the photo's."}
{"text":"Walked in on a Saturday evening and the place is empty. Totally empty, save for the guys working. Not a good sign. Perhaps it was that the fact that their sign wasn't working. But perhaps that assumption is too kind.    You order at a cash register after looking at the menu and pictures of the rolls taped to the glass of the sushi bar. Kind of makes ordering difficult if you want to take your time perusing the menu. At least the place was empty and we didn't feel rushed.    We ordered edamane, dumplings, and miso to start. The edamane was a bit too salty. The dumplings were fried, crispy, and fairly tasty. I didn't have the miso, but my sister-in-law and daughter were not impressed. They said it tasted like the instant kind you can buy at a grocery store.     We tried a few rolls next. The vegan friendly caterpillar roll was ok. It was too saturated in the sauce though, which made it fall apart the instant you tried to pick it up. The Hawaiian roll was totally bland. I couldn't even tell you what was in it. The spicy California roll was indeed spicy. That's about all I can say. The spider roll was pretty good.     This is the deal. You pay more than you should for small, subpar portions of bland food. The restaurant tries to be trendy and sleek with its decor, but when the ordering is set up like a fast food place... well yeah. It kind of kills whatever ambiance the place could have.    2 stars because I didn't get food poisoning. But that certainly isn't enough to make me want to go back."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in Vegas.  The food is amazing and the service is perfect.  I especially like the shrimp tempura on the appetizer menu and the funky roll (soft-shell crab)."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The scenery is absolutely beautiful. The staff is very nice and eager to cater to every customer. Everything I've tried here is amazing. It's really quaint but I love it!"}
{"text":"Great sashimi, teriyaki and miso soup...  Cozy, a bit trendy and clean.  Great option in the Tempe/Mesa/Gilbert area.  Family owned, phenomenal service and food to die for."}
{"text":"This place is Ok. Lot's of variety and they even have sandwiches. Rolls so far have been nice and tightly rolled and the fish is fresh. They have some real unique rolls too like that crab and fruit roll. It isn't the best sushi I've had, but it is the best nearest to my house. So I like to get a quick fix if I'm heading to the nearby blockbuster. I think I have to go rent a movie soon."}
{"text":"As others have mentioned, the sushi is mostly crab mix. We ordered two sashimi and two rolls. The sashimi fish was very cold and still had ice in it! I guess they don't get many requests for sashimi. The dragon roll with eel tasted good and had a nice presentation. Basically, this is a training-wheels sushi place. The variety is limited, although they have many creative rolls - they all amount to the same few ingredients-crab mix, fried eel, shrimp, salmon.  Also, a warning. We used a restaurant.com certificate. The fine print includes18% gratuity. No big deal... IF there is a wait staff!! To be charged 18% for ordering at the counter ?!? The gift certificate gets $10 off a $35 purchase, and they charged me $9 for a mandatory \"tip\". So I saved $1.  Between the mediocre quality and the dishonest business practices, they won't be seeing me again!"}
{"text":"Quiet lunch with great menu options.  I like to think of myself as health conscious so I usually order the salad/roll combos. The price is reasonable.  The salad is fresh and good size and every dressing I've had is delicious. The rolls are yummy. I am a \"basic\" sushi kind of gal so a good spicy tuna or rainbow roll makes me happy and this place has it. You can also Belly-up which offers a frequent flier type of rewards system...I'm always a fan of being a valued customer. Friendly staff always greets me as I walk in and thanks me when I leave. My favorite fast yummy lunch time spot...and Starbucks on the side makes a nice combo for a midday caffeine pick me up."}
{"text":"One of my Fav Sushi joints to eat at. I go there for lunch all the time. I have never had this 18% gratuity thing added to my bill so it must be for Dinner only."}
{"text":"Disgusting.  Have you ever experienced a time where you are just craving sushi, so much that even a philadelphia roll platter would do? If so, have you ever been so revolted you couldn't finish the roll?  I hope you haven't. This was my first experience with that and I was left heartbroken and sad and wishing I had never decided to give this place a chance.   While the decor is amazing, the menu looks unique and spectacular and even the rolls looked amazingly tempting when I brought them home, the love affair stops there. It's all superficial, and I don't date that type."}
{"text":"Cafe Wasabi home of innovative Sushi. I use to live around the corner. I've eaten here so many times. I hold stock in this place. The Sushi master makes riceless sushi. He also uses thin cucumber instead of nori. They have different flavored rock candy martini's. I love Cafe Wasabi. We shall meet again. Soon."}
{"text":"My significant other had a $25 off coupon from Restaurant.com LOL. That could sum up the whole trip. I haven't been to many restaurants that participate with restaurant.com that are decent at all. I mean, I wasn't expecting much coming into this place, I shouldn't have expected anything here.  I was in the mood for some red meat, and sushi places do actually have decent dishes like teriyaki chicken and stuff like that sometimes. So, I didn't mind checking this place out since I do like a little bit of sushi on the side. The boolgogee, plain, simply plain. There was a salad with the boolgogee, but it too was plain. There wasn't nearly enough meat to warrant a price tag of $8, because the salad and rice probably didn't cost more than $0.50 to make.  Oh, the sushi? All of the sushi we happened to get were either super plain or super spicy. By spicy, I mean that there were just too many tastes going on at the same time and it was too overwhelming. I tried a few bites of the 3-4 different rolls we got. After I tried each roll I thought that I liked it but that the taste was too overwhelming for me to want to try another bite. We paid $18 for the food even after the coupon, and I honestly think that even at the price it might be a bit of a rip off considering you can get cheaper, higher quality sushi at Teharu.  This place is a rip-off for sushi in my opinion. Its not good enough to warrant the hefty price tag. The sad part is that the interior is very well done, if the food was actually good this place would be extremely interesting."}
{"text":"Go here with a discounted restaurant.com coupon and you won't be disappointed.  We used a $35 \"certificate\" that we purchased for $2 rather than $10 since we entered a 80% off code (try retailmenot.com for codes).  Cafe Wasabi serves a great variety of rolls- some are quite ubiquitous at sushi restaurants (spicy tuna, California), while others have a more exotic and creative flair (Passion fruit roll, which has mango and kiwi, or New Frontier roll, which has bacon in it).  We tried a variety, and while they all tasted good, like other reviewers have noted, they do skimp on the fish part of the sushi, slice it pretty thin, and bulk up the rest of the cheaper ingredients to keep down costs.  As a result, I wouldn't go here and pay full price, but I would definitely eat here again with another coupon.  We ordered 4 rolls and 2 drinks and our total was ~$20 dollars with tax and tip using the coupon.  Note that drinks, even soda, will not be counted towards the coupon."}
{"text":"good sushi, nice atmosphere and the price is right!!!"}
{"text":"eh, I don't know how to even start this. I guess I'll start on the positives the staff was very nice and I used the restaurant.com coupon so I got about $40 dollars worth of sushi for like $22 after tip. Also, the interior was really cool looking and the little sake bottles along the wall that had been signed and stuff was a nice touch. Now the problem is that this was probably the most bland sushi I have ever eaten. It's not that anything was out right disgusting (maybe it was due to blandness idk, but it wasn't full of any weird nasty flavors) but I didn't finish much of the food at all.  I had a good mix of different rolls.. firecracker (i think) which sounded good with spicy tuna and shrimp tempura, along with a spicy tuna, a vegas, and the sushi sampler with various nigiri. The prices were cheap so I wasn't expecting anything amazing but lets just say if I had paid full price I would have been severely disappointed and this might have gotten one star. Everything was just bland and the definition of \"Meh\", the nigiri had super thin slices fish on it which isn't a terrible thing but it was on a HUGE ball of rice so I was basically eating riceballs. The spicy tuna which is hard to mess up was just not good at all. The rest was just more of the same.   Overall, this place is getting a gift with two stars. I really like sushi and I have no problem eating it at cheaper places (think Ra happy hour or even Teharu Sushi) but this is honestly a place I won't be coming back to no matter how cheap it is."}
{"text":"Much better than RA or some of the other places around. I just wish the staff was a little more friendly. Also I am always scared my ass is going to rip through the chairs they have and everyone is going to laugh at me Well I have been here over a dozen times and if it hasnt happened by now I think I might be safe, no I am still scared."}
{"text":"Stopping in for a quick & quiet lunch, I am always delighted with the Sashimi & Seafood salad, with the most delicious soy sauce \"dressing\" I've ever tasted. I try to stop by here whenever I am in the area, maybe once or twice a month. The food is flavorful, good value & the staff are friendly and eager to give a good experience."}
{"text":"Their Sushi is not exactly the freshest, and the staff looked at me strangely when I asked if they had real wasabi.  I am not sure why you would name your restaurant after something you don't serve :(."}
{"text":"The fish didn't appear to be fresh. No warm rolls."}
{"text":"A friend and I were in the mood for sushi a few days ago, and CW is really close to my house, so we decided to try it out.  We walked in, and the place was small, but tidy, and set up with a few tables in a row along one wall, with one long communal table in the middle of the room.   It's sort of halfway between a sit-down place and a fast food place. You place your order for sushi at the counter, then take a seat, and they bring it out to you.    There are a TON of different sushi options.  My friend and I ordered the Las Vegas roll, the Philly roll, and the Shrimp Tempura roll, as well as a dish of edamame to nibble on while we waited.   The sushi we had was a fantastic quality, and it rivaled the quality of my other 2 favorite sushi restaurants.   I was thrilled with the LV roll and Shrimp Tempura roll.  The Philly roll was good as well, but I like my sushi with some crunch, so it's not a huge favorite of mine to begin with, so it's hard to rave about it, but my friend loved it, except they put a drizzle of sour cream over the top of the roll, which he wasn't sure if he liked or not.  But, all ingredients were fresh, the tempura crunchy, portion sizes were between normal and generous, I'd say. Some places make really small rolls, others bigger. This place makes them a little bigger.   Prices were standard for sushi. My LV roll was $9.95, and the other two rolls were $7.95-$8.95, I believe.   I spent about $25-27 for 2 rolls, the edamame, and a drink.   I will definitely be back. I really liked this place."}
{"text":"We love sushi and we have been to some of the best sushi places in most of the major cities in the US and Canada. We are always looking for good sushi at a good price. So after getting a discounted gift certificate from restaurant.com we decided to try Cafe Wasabi. It's located in a strip mall but is nicely appointed inside. We spent a good while looking at the countless rolls available which were all pictured across the counter. This is perfect for those people who like to see what they are about to eat. We ordered a several different rolls and nigiri to sample it all.  We spent about $70 for a two adults and 2 small kids. Good thing we had that gift certificate. Overall, the sushi was very good and the service was good. Again they have a great selection to choose from and I am looking forward to sampling more of the options."}
{"text":"Thank you yelpers for this great heads-up. I visited on my vacation to Vegas and was not disappointed in the least. The prices were not cheap, but much more reasonable than the Strip, and the food really was first-rate. The place was empty when I was there, but the service was very friendly and quick.   I loved the shrimp tempura, and the rolls were outstanding too. Didn't try any sashimi, so I won't comment on that. Bill for two was $50 even."}
{"text":"The food and presentation were excellent.  It was very colorful, tasty, and fresh.  My problem is with the service where I felt like I just got served by the North Korean Communist party member after being charged 18% service charge for counter service (I thought this is only given in a full service restaurant) by using restaurant.com.  The Chirashi Bop (Korean name for mixed sushi with Rice) were beautifully presented with caviars, tuna, shrimp, yellow tail, as well as ginger sauce laced salad.  The miso soup were made by instant package with heavy residue so I will NOT order another ever.  Edamame was cooked with perfection with sprinkle sea salt on the outside.  The restaurant is quite avant-garde but I know the server was probably the owner so be prepared to be served by stoic looking Chaebol who really don't want to be there but had to."}
{"text":"RUN AWAY. I would of given back the 25 dollar gift card if I could of avoided the food poisoning."}
{"text":"for Saturday night their website says the are open till 830, google says 9, resturaunt.com says 9 we get there at 7:13 and they say they just closed the kitchen. they obviously don't want customers or income"}
{"text":"I like this place! The staff is nice, the location is clean and cute, and the food's good."}
