{"text":"My fellow yelpers' I really enjoyed this place beers are cold food is warm price is what it is at an airport. I am looking forward to coming here again on my return trip! Not sure why everyone complains about speed maybe I got them on a good day food and drinks where pretty fast."}
{"text":"Family of four waiting for our flight and couldn't find any other options for grabbing something to eat at the airport after security check-in. The server seemed frenetic and was very moody, alternating between being nervous, friendly and PO'd. The restaurant was almost empty.  We got our entrees and I didn't like mine as there was no seasoning in the chicken. I could have just poured ketchup on it but was hoping to exchange the entree for something more palatable. I look up and she is already at our table with the card machine - never asked us did we want anything else, nothing. She charged like the wind and ran off after my husband paid. I told him that I was planning to talk to her about my entree. 

We called her over and I explained and she was outright angry, waved her hand and said \"I'll reverse it!\" and stormed off. She could have offered to switch the entree out for something else but seemed intent on rushing us out of there. During this period she was very agitated and was waving her hands around and angrily talking with a co-worker/manager.  

I think she was further incensed because we didn't put a tip on the card, but that's only because my (adult) son wanted to pitch in for his meal by paying the tip. To that end, we asked her for change, which she said she didn't have.  From what she was saying when she ran the credit card the second time, my son got the impression that she would be responsible for paying for the entree so he was pretty upset (I learned this just after we left).  Because of that and how awkward the situation had become, my son offered her the whole $20 (which was like a 40% tip) which we then had to beg her to take, she was being so difficult!  

When we left and my family went to the restroom, I went back to make sure she did not have to pay for the entree. She showed me the void receipt and said that she would have been responsible for the amount had she not done it a certain way, which is what she was telling us when she ran the card a second time. My family was then sullen for the rest of the time before our flight. My son's steak sandwich was good, drinks were good, so it's a shame. She made it such a negative, negative experience. An embarrassing time was had by all. I can't imagine going there again."}
{"text":"Flying out of YYZ yesterday I made it through security quickly and was super hungry while waiting at my gate for my flight (the downside to being early/on time). As those of you who are regular flyers through Pearson know, some of the Terminals are absolutely rife with amazing new food options, not Terminal 1 US departures. There was the Molson Pub (which was terrible) and a few chain options and other than that it's airport food and drink.

I happened upon Red Rockets and basically went in because I had never been and was hungry enough to try anything once. The decor is very similar to a 1950's diner, but with a Toronto TTC red flair (hence the Red Rocket name.... Ride the rocket is the catch phrase for getting on our subway system, for you travelers).

The menu was basic diner fare, some all day breakfast options, burgers, fries, standard mains and salads. Nothing really grabbed me on the menu so I decided to try something a little different and went with the Fried Chicken Salad. I was pleasantly surprised when the salad turned out to be cooked greens underneath 3-4 solid pieces of fried chicken strips. I believe the specific greens used were a mix of kale and Brussel sprout greens. The meal was surprisingly good and very satisfying, something I would recommend trying if a burger and fries just isn't doing it for you. 

The X factor for me was the multiple types of ketchup they had on hand: pepper ketchup, chipotle ketchup, Ghost Pepper Ketchup and a couple of others. While they were not spicy, they all had very unique flavour profiles which meshed well with the sweetness of the ketchup.

Initially I would have ranked this place a 3 star but the food and service were good enough and the specialty ketchups put it over the top for me this time. Next time I want something simple when traveling out of this terminal I'm definitely going to stop back in at Red Rockets.

{"text":"The service here was terrible. Our waitress was extremely rude. After being seated, our waitress did not hand us menus and told us to wait at the table to be given a menu. We were absolutely ok with that, but every time she passed us she ignored us. After a long while, I walked to the front to find a menu to look ourselves so that we could be ready with our orders whenever she was ready. To my shock she came to the front, snatched the menu from my hands and started yelling at me loudly to wait. I was horrified, we immediately left."}
{"text":"For airport food, this is pretty good! Had rushed to the airport to catch a flight after work, so hadn't yet had dinner! Walked around the terminal trying to decide on something to eat that was more than 'fast food', and decided on Red Rockets here in Terminal 1.

Had a nice little seating area with TVs with the options for sitting in or taking out. A larger variety than what I expected and had a full bar as well! Decided to get the Flank Steak off a chef's menu, and was quite happy with the overall plate. Quite a flourish of sides that cane with it, including a salad, devilled eggs, potatoes, and broccolini. The steak was cooked quite well, but wasn't expecting it to be cut already. The sauce itself was a bit strong and salty, but it you scraped some of it off, it was alright. Was a nice meal in the airport and decent for $18. The food did take about 10 min to get to the table though. 

If you have enough time before or between flights (at least 30 min), than this would be a feasible option."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: this in the context of airport food and everything is relative. More like 3.5/5.

Atmosphere: Really cool, very diner-ish, but it didn't feel like you were in an airport.  3.5/5
Service:  It's kind of weird here as you seat yourself and the servers will come to you and bring you a menu.  3/5
Food/price:  Not cheap, but it's different than your standard burgers/pizza/beer at the airport. They had a quesadilla, a steak (I think), veal liver plus the standard burgers/sandwiches. 3.5/5

My order: Veal liver and chopped onions - $12.00 and coke - $2.29 or $2.99 (I can't remember) .  The liver was grilled very well and tasted really good with the chopped onions.  Don't get me wrong, I'm sure I can find better if I go to three places in dowtown TO and one of them is bound to be better, but let's be honest here, this is an airport and it's not Pizza Pizza or Starbucks, so yeah, it's something different.


Verdict: If I were to be near this gate again, I'd look for this place instead of going to \"Upper Crust\", which is just sandwiches mostly."}
{"text":"After a frigid 12 hour flight with 4 hour layover and 5 hour flight to go, I needed something that would kill the bug that was up my a$$. 

I guess I went the wrong direction but this seemed to be the only option. It was pretty empty except for the friendly server. I thought the  food and drink was pretty good and certainly better than the slop Air Canada served on the flight."}
{"text":"Wanted to grab a bite before my flight and this place was close to my gate. Got there near closing but managed to get food. Servers were friendly and good was good and reasonable. Ordered the monster jam burger which came with fries. The burger was really good and the fries tasted homemade but seemed to be frozen. All and all it was a good experience and above the average airport food. Would go back again."}
{"text":"Prices are not bad for an airport.  Took a little bit too long for the food to arrive, I think it had to do with some confusion with the cooks concerning \"gluten free\".  \" You are correct a slice of bread should not be on the plate\". It was pretty slow and was surprised how long it takes for service and coffee refill. Whatever, it is breakfast at an airport, not a huge deal."}
{"text":"Very bad customer service. So so food. Many items in menu are not available. 
The lady who served our table refused payment until I accepted the tip percentage.
I will not come back to this place again."}
{"text":"Got $20 worth of complimentary certificates because the flight attendants were not able to hold the plane for us and they recommended this place.

I ordered were salad and he ordered the Philly cheesesteak. He liked the sandwich and was surprised how good it was. The fries were really good!

I on the other hand was very disappointed. I wanted a regular wedge salad. The wedge salad had a very lemon-y dressing that I did not find to be all that great. They had something pickled and it did not add anything to the dish.

The service was good, but I'm not sure I would stop here again if I were to come to this airport."}
{"text":"With a short layover in Toronto the wife and I decided to grab some food in the terminal rather than spend so much $$$ for an in flight meal.
Our gate was right next to RR 192 Grill, which was very convenient .
It's a quick service joint with plenty of seats as well as a bar.
The gent behind the cash register was very friendly and informative about the menu. 
We had about a 20 minute window before the plane would start boarding...he ensured us our grub would be served with time to spare, no sweat.
They delivered.
I got the breakfast BLT (BELT that is) and the wife got french toast.
My BELT was damn fine. 
Those Canadians love their mayo and I love a B(E)LT with plenty of it. My sandwich had a nice dollop layered on each half. Paired with fresh lettuce, tomato, bacon and a perfectly runny egg...I'm looking at a solid meal here. 
Not to mention the potatoes on the side were prefect. 
They weren't like regular french fries hash browns or home fries. They were length-wise sliced pieces, lightly fried, crispy with good seasoning. 
Never had breakfast taters like that before.
Quite good.
The french toast was ample. 
Four nice triangle served along with two pieces of bacon (which I must add, were big, crispy strips on both my sandwich and on her plate) and two chubby sausage links.
The price was typical to an airport terminal. 
I think my BELT was like 7 bucks and the french toast was about the same. 
Throw in some OJ, a coffee and tip...you're looking at about 20 bucks or so.
At the end of the day the food was good, served fast and friendly. 
That's an airport diners' trifecta right there."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of the place, mainly I found the service to be very slow. I finished my drink by the time my food arrived, and I had to ask for a takeaway container (they didn't bother to give me a plastic fork).  The food itself was okay - I got the fried chicken salad, a bit on the burnt side, but it was decent.

I was very disappointed in their menu. I was really hoping for an appetizer, but all they had was a limited selection of main courses."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast en route to the US for Thanksgiving. Food was tasty overall. Bacon was undercooked but they fixed it. Eggs were inconsistent but tasted good. Red potatoes were still firm but had potential to be delicious. A bit pricey but probably the best sit-down meal we've had at the Toronto airport. We would definitely give them a second chance."}
{"text":"Good airport food!
I really enjoyed the fried chicken salad and my husband liked his salmon. Pricing isn't too bad."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here and I was glad I had plenty of time.  Slow does not even begin to describe the service here.  Young waitress didn't want to be here and even said s*** when she noticed a problem with the order.  She then said, \"oh, I meant shoot!\"  Eggs were overcooked and Canadian bacon was charred.  Got tired of waiting and poured my own coffee.  Avoid their breakfast!"}
