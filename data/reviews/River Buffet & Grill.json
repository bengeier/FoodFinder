{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE!! This buffet used to be Tokyo buffet. And they were storing meat OUTSIDE near the DUMPSTER. Sanitation grade is always low. Google previous restaurant name."}
{"text":"I have found this Buffet for AMERICAN,CHINESE,Japanese to be of very good quality,friendly service and staff. I normally try to go here at least once a week.The price is very low for such quality."}
{"text":"One star because can't blah any lower blah.  Uh over fried everything fried, time and temp abused Philly steak roll (presumably from the dawn of time), pizza so undercooked the dough was less done than frozen ready to bake biscuits.   The chicken dishes...none made it past one bite. The only thing I found on the buffet that wasn't totally gross or bland was the yeast rolls. So tonight I'm living off the sketchy scoop it from the well yourself ice cream and the strange cookies that aren't as sweet as they look.  Mountain Dew was good though, Pepsi must be cleaning the fountain for them.  If I choose between this place and death, I choose death 9 out of 10."}
{"text":"They are close to my work, has plenty of choices, so I go at least twice a week for lunch. Yesterday I started to eat and found the fork had a sharp spot and cut my upper lip. So I went to the waitress changed a fork and told her it cut. Later during my eating, it bothered me, due to the different food, and raw sushi, I think it is better to record it.  I told the waitress again that I was cut, if it went away it would be fine, if it got infected, I would have to go to doctor and gave them the bill. She said \"oh, I thought you said the fork was dirty, I put it in the wash. You need to talk to manager. \" The manager came, a young guy, i described what happened, he said it was impossible. I told him \" I come here eat often, I am not here to make trouble...Can you write it up.\" He said ok and went to the utensils wash to search for the fork.  I felt the wound stung bad when I ate pineapple. After I finished, the manager was still writing the record. Then I was given it to sign\" In the end he wrote, they could not find the fork in the bin. I asked him what was the purpose of putting it there, saying I was not telling the truth? He said \"it would be for insurance, they pay you, we don't, we searched and didn't find it, you can explain to insurance.\" I asked him how he searched, he said looked. I said \"if I could see the thorn would I stuck into my mouth?! You have to touch it along the edge.\" He again said \"it is between you and insurance, you can explain to them.\"  By then I was upset and told him more people would get hurt by this. If you eat there, chopsticks probably safer. If you use those small thin steel forks, be sure to run your finger along the edges ensure no sharps."}
{"text":"Considering they were open on Thanksgiving, they should receive 5 stars. The food was all fresh and tasty. I know a big deal for people picking a chinese buffet is.....amount of seafood. Well for you, they had crab legs, scallops,salmon,talapia, and shrimp cooked about as many ways as Bubba from Forest Gump could name. The sushi bar was the best I have ever found at a buffet, even had shashimi. Pair all that with great service, and thats where I say. Ill be back."}
{"text":"Food is well flavored and fresh tasting. Great variety. The price is outstanding! Only draw back is the food that is supposed to be crispy has gone soft from the steam, sitting in chafing dishes to keep warm."}
{"text":"Out here at #NewRiverGrillandBuffet, previously #TokyoGrillandBuffet, who was previously in the news for poor food preparation which spurred the name change, in Charlotte, and there's some substance in the ice. I poked it with a screwdriver and it oozes. When the manager was brought to the table he decided calling me a liar was more appropriate than handling the actual situation. Horrendous customer service and horrendous practices. They still had the audacity to charge me too. WILL NOT BE BACK. #FOX46"}
{"text":"They get under new management for a while and the food are great! I love crawfish so much and always get 2 plates or more lol!! Definately will come back with my family"}
{"text":"So this use to be \" Tokyo's buffet\" this is basically the same place. Everything is set up the same. They still have the pound and water fountain, the same party room ( great for family get together, birthday party and more). Because I told my kids that's were we was going, they was happy. I personally was upset when I found out just the name changed (sad face)   I guess just the name changed... the question is I wonder why???"}
{"text":"The key with any all-you-can-eat buffet is to go when they're busy. The food is fresh, hot, and it doesn't taste like it's been sitting there for an hour. Of course, some buffets taste like that all the time. River does not.  If you go to River during their busy times, you'll be pleased with the quality of their food. Lots of choices. Usually there's a carving station with ham, turkey or prime rib. Sushi bar and Hibachi service are good.   All-in-all, I like it enough I've now been there about 25 times. I started going when it was Tokyo Grill and Buffet. I really don't notice a different between then and now.  The service might be worthy of a complaint, but my bar is set so low for service these days that it's really not worth complaining about. Customer service will never be like it was. I've just come to accept that. Besides, it's a buffet. You mostly serve yourself anyway. They'll bring you silverware, seat you and (mostly) keep your drinks filled.   I would recommend River to anyone who wants an above-average all-you-can-eat Chinese Buffet. I doubt you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Many many diferente choices The sushi is good  All type of fruits and sweet  Good price"}
{"text":"My favorite buffet in town!! A lot of variety in food, clean and familiar, the sushi it's good!!!"}
{"text":"Nothing was appetizing here. I tried their wings and it taste like shit. I tried their chicken broccoli and it did not taste like chicken. God forbid it be a meat other than chicken. Their rice was not consistent. half of my rice was hard. The waitress was very nice but didn't know english. I do not recommend eating here for the price of $11.90   Not worth it. Should be a $5 buffet instead because of the lack of quality even for a buffet. I think Cici's pizza has more thoroughly cooked food than this piece of shit. Never eating here again."}
