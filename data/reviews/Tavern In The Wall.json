{"text":"It's hard to screw up a mixed drink or a draft so no issues there. If you call a $10 bowl of iceberg lettuce, sprinkled with blackberries and goat cheese a culinary delight, then this is your place. My advice...pass when it comes to eating there."}
{"text":"Tavern in the Wall is a symbol of America. Though my friend Andy thinks it should be called Tavern in A Wall because it's in Aspinwall. God bless."}
{"text":"Always a great rotation of drafts.  First I've seen this season with Pumking!  Owner asks what we like and delivers."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times now and I happily regard it as a go-to place after a long day's work, when I'm too tired to cook. I'm guessing that the prior writer who said that this is not a restaurant, but a bar, has never tried the daily specials. These off-the-menu options are fresh, thoughtfully prepared and taste just like home-cooking!   Try the short ribs braised in red wine reduction, for example, or the chicken and dumpling soup - you'll swear your mom made it, and at a reasonable price, too! My husband is a fan of the fried fish sandwich. I also order the steak salad and the beet salad, which is chock full of fresh roasted beets!

I've found the waitstaff and apparent owner, Sam, to be extremely friendly and helpful. There are also good drink specials each and every day. 

I almost hesitate to disclose this information because I like our little secret \"go-to\" place in Aspinwall; so much, in fact, that we travel from the city to go there!  

Finally, save room for dessert -  these, too, are homemade. Try the apple pie (warm, of course, with ice cream) or one of the house-made cakes. You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Service has been great when I've been there. There are good beers on tap and we have always enjoyed our meals there."}
{"text":"I enjoy stopping here for some good priced drinks. They have different drink specials every night of the week. I enjoy just getting appetizers here because some of the other \"dinners\" are over priced. Definitely a chill place to hang out."}
{"text":"for starters the place is the same as before ,it's still to bright, food fare,beer selection fare,bad decor

same place different sign

we felt the food was the same as eating at Eat-n-Park
fish was over cooked, & just a plain ,bland chicken salad but the tomatoes were fresh


In this  case a change in the name didn't change restaurant"}
{"text":"Best pot roast sandwich I've ever had. The homemade gravy is excellent, and the staff are all very friendly."}
{"text":"Very customer unfriendly! No updated menu on line--I see that the owner has since updated this. Gave owner a big fish sandwich order of more than $135. Then the nickel and diming began. Upcharged despite being told about the price listed on line. Also charged delivery on each order--not a flat rate. We had a dozen orders! When I checked the online menu the following week, the fish sandwich was still listed as $8.99. The owner actually delivered the order and insisted the online menu stated the current price. Will neither go to this establishment nor order from them again. Just call me bitter."}
{"text":"A great place to grab a burger if you are in the aspinwall area.  The sister and I stopped in here because they had good yelp reviews and we were getting a little hungry for lunch.  Service could have been a little more attentive and they could use some better beers on tap.  The portions are huge so you can actually share a plate with somebody.  I ordered up a burger with bleu cheese and onions.  I expected my onions to be cooked and caramelized but I got a crunchy red onion which was not what I wanted.  Oh-well--there are several places in the area so I would probably opt for trying another one next time."}
{"text":"2nd time here. Good and friendly service. Got the tavern Salad with shrimp. Very loud when busy.  It overall a good place to eat."}
{"text":"CHIPS.  That is all you need to know.  When you order any sandwich on the menu ask for CHIPS, or just get a app of CHIPS.  They are great. Not sure if it on the menu as a side, but just ask.  

I love the small town feel of the Tavern on the Wall.  It is like your own little kitchen, home cooking at its best, with no clean up.    FYI, they have bands on the weekends."}
{"text":"The ribs were okay.  Menu stated I would get two sides and a salad, it was a misprint, so I got one side.  I was okay with that since our very good waitress let me know in advance, but the coleslaw was not good at all.  The other dish at the table was overpriced for what it was.  Ravioli, which was most likely frozen with canned sauce or a sauce that was substandard.  I think the menu is much too large to keep things fresh and quality.  Better to have a small menu and do those items well, than a huge menu that is mostly just frozen stuff.  If you are going to serve frozen items, the price need to reflect that, so the Ravioli should be under $10.  The salad was good though and pretty fresh.  The beer selection isn't very good for an area like Aspinwall.  It is tough these days with super high overhead and all the massive taxes from Onorato, but places still can deliver.   

The atmosphere, even though it is a sports bar with a ton of TVs is still friendly and nice.  I wish it had no TVs and had a small menu with really good food, but that is very hard to find in our region.  I will return and get snacks and a beer.  Like the people there."}
{"text":"I had lunch in a work day. The service was fast and nice. Food really tasty and lots of specials to chose from. The place is rally cozy and nice."}
{"text":"Met friends here for a late lunch.  The food was good but not great.  Reuben sandwich was filled with corned beef on good bread.  The waitress was fairly pleasant, but generally inattentive; she never refilled my water glass and only came to our table when signaled.  
The bar/dining area seemed clean overall, but a trip to the restroom revealed a dirty hallway floor and unkept ladies room.  
Tavern In the Wall is an OK place, but nothing special. I doubt that we will go here again."}
{"text":"I don't necessarily think of Tavern in the Wall as a restaurant, but a bar that serves food. With that being said, the prices are extremely overpriced for a bar, especially when the serving sizes are rather small. The only thing that keeps me going back is the buffalo chicken dip. It's the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Food is solid, drinks are well priced and the selection is decent. I personally could eat the buffalo chicken dip every day, my husband loves their burger. I'm giving it 5 stars for what it is- a great neighborhood bar with friendly service, colorful regulars, and great examples of the kind of food and drink you expect from a no frills neighborhood joint.  Pro-tip: come on a Friday night for Karaoke- the regulars are really very good!"}
{"text":"I really want to like it here but I've now been here twice and it just hasn't been a great experience either time.   Both times it's been service and atmosphere that's been my issue, not food.  I've sat at the bar both times, and I've felt like getting waited on was an inconvenience (i.e. interrupting the bartenders' conversations with regulars).   We've gone here to watch sporting events, have ordered steady drinks and ordered food...I promise we tip well.  Despite being at an rather empty bar, it's like I'm begging for them to take my order, refill our drinks or just plain take my money.   Call me crazy but make newbies feel welcome, so they become the regulars that you spend all your time on or else we'll go elsewhere.  Despite all that, they have a good selection of beer and the food is good for bar food."}
{"text":"The food was decent. I had cheese ravioli and the sauce wasn't anything special. Friend had a burger with Gouda that did look appetizing. I would recommend the bar for its selection and service. The early crowd is the older, die-hard patrons."}
{"text":"So I don't leave a whole lot of Yelp reviews but this place is an amazing little local bar. The staff is always incredibly efficient and nice! The food is also stellar. The Grille Burger is by far the best burger I've had in Pittsburgh. Easily beats all of these fancy burger joints that are popping up around town (and better priced too!!). Everything I have ever had at the Tavern is awesome. Oh and their bloody mary's are stellar!"}
{"text":"I'm fairly new to Aspinwall and have enjoyed trying all of the different places around here.  Tavern in the Wall is the type of business that Aspinwall needs -- casual bar/restaurant where you can grab a brew and a bite, watch your Steelers/Pens/Pirates/whoever games, and generally just have a good time. 

I enjoy Tavern in the Wall as a bar.  They have some great drink specials, friendly staff, and free live entertainment on many weekends.  The owner also seems like a nice guy.  As a restaurant, however, it's sorely lacking.  The food, I hate to say, definitely resonates as your typical blah, not-horrible-but-not-great bar food.  That would be completely fine with me if Tavern in the Wall acted like a bar serving bar food.  But their food is priced like they believe they are a legit dining destination -- seriously, $10 for a fried zucchini appetizer? For reference, the high-end Joseph Tambellini restaurant across the bridge in Highland Park charges $9 for fried zucchini. $17 for pasta with sauce? Again, just to put that in perspective, Girasole in Shadyside charges $13. Based on the \"bar quality\" of The Tavern's food, their prices definitely need to come down to Earth and be more in line with the type of food they serve....either that, or they need to up their game quality-wise and change their bar vibe to more of a nice restaurant vibe to justify the price.  

So, in sum, if you're looking for a good local watering hole where you can catch a drink, definitely give Tavern in the Wall a try...but if all you're in the market for is a great dinner, I'd look elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is a fun, cozy, welcoming bar/restaurant with good food, good service and good people. It is often
a regular quick stop in our way to anywhere. The soups are outstanding, the specials creative and delicious. The Grille burger was my husband's birthday dinner of choice!  
Sam, the jovial owner, is almost always around-greeting customers, helping tend bar, supervising the kitchen. Making sure everyone feels welcome and treating the staff and customers like family. Go before 5 and say hi to Alana- the most competent, charming, and knowledgeable bartender I have ever met!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous meal!!!  Great service from Sue.  Sam owner is a super nice guy and stopped by to introduce himself; how often does that happen!

We ordered the tuna sandwich.  One was grilled, one was blackened.  We agreed that it was the best fish sandwich we've had in years, yum!!  As good as any in the 'Burgh!

Sides were veggies (very fresh), and I got fries (crispy & delicious)!

Definitely will be back often!"}
{"text":"Good little place to grab a quick bite to eat
And support local business.  If you haven't tried their quesadilla your missing out as it's yummy!"}
