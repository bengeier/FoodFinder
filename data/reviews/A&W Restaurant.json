{"text":"Great place to stop for a quick meal.  Simple menu.  Good quality food. Retro interior alone is worth the stop."}
{"text":"Food decent. Manager is a rude SOB! I called about a coupon and a young lady said it was fine to use! We got there, the A**H***   manager argued no \" I won't take it!  Fine, we went to Culvers down the street! Much better service and food! Save yourself the aggravation. Just go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"I was in Wisconsin visiting my family, and stopped in to see if A&W was still as good as I remembered from my childhood.  Holy Cow, it's even better!  I got the coney dog, french fries (Mickey D's ain't got jack on these guys!),  cheese curds, and of course a root beer float-- everything was simply delicious!  The manager and staff were so friendly and helpful, and although the food was made to order, the wait was next to nothing.  And don't even get me started on the restrooms-- I am a bit of a germophobe, so it was a pleasant surprise to see them clean, very well kept, and pretty decent sized for a fast food restaurant.  The glass atrium and the mural just made my visit that much more special.  I will definitely be back!:)"}
{"text":"Lifetime favorite. Restaurant was recently renovated,  added more seating, and updated decor."}
{"text":"Worlds slowest drive thru. I've been here at least ten times in the last year - guarantee you may have to wait up to ten minutes."}
{"text":"I'm in here a couple of dozen times a year.  A&W root beer. Right out of the tap. That's the taste of summer"}
{"text":"We usually stop here on the way to Wisconsin Dells and this restaurant delivers every time.  Unlike some A&W's, this one is clean and gives you attentive service.   Our group had a fish sandwich, double cheeseburger, brats, fried cheese curds and of course, A&W Root Beer on tap.  The Root Beer was classic A&W, sweet with that vanilla aftertaste. Burgers and brats were good.  So were the cheese curds although if you have too many, you feel like you ate a bag of lead.  Manager was attentive throughout.  If' you're cruising up or down 90/94, you can't lose if you stop here."}
{"text":"Fresh root beer made right in store. A very nice touch. Manager was super nice, very friendly. Not often I have a fast food experience this enjoyable. Food still tasted like...grease but as far as this set of employees goes I was very pleased."}
{"text":"I feel like the food at A&W has continued to go downhill the last few years, and although my visits have become few and far between, the food gets consistently worse. I wish we would have circled around the drive thru and given the food right back. Bland burgers, bland hot dogs, and expensive as all get up. I don't think I'll be back at A&W unless I hear things have gotten better."}
{"text":"I was staying the night next door at the Super 8 hotel and decided to walk to the restaurant, since I have never eaten at A&W before.  I ordered a large vanilla shake and cheese fries.  They were delicious.  I would have given 5 stars but the lines moved too slowly.   They offer burgers and fries like fast food restaurant but with a casual feel being less rushed.  They sell A&W mugs and pitchers and have a ole timey tap for refills of root beer.  Nice experience and delicious food."}
{"text":"I love the root beer ! Service and atmosphere was cafeteria-like, food was average. Chicken strips and cheese curds were good."}
{"text":"Loved the root beer floats, the manager /owner really gave good customer service. They were very busy at lunch time and he every where making sure everyone had a good experience"}
{"text":"I was just passing through the area when I stopped for some quick food. This place was a very pleasant surprise. Everything was clean, the food was very fresh (we arrived 30 mins after they opened) and delicious, and the staff was friendly. Classic A&W themed decor was a nice touch as well."}
{"text":"Hamburgers were very delicious and we enjoy it very much however the staff messed up our order. We received someone's order and we ate. Then they delivered our order... what??? Someone can't read the ticket number? We kept pointing it out and they said it was alright so we ate... then they went oops. The place was very clean and comfortable."}
{"text":"Great staff and great food. Right off the exit, clean and well managed. The food was fresh and fast and all five of us liked our selections. The cherry on top is we left I left my hat behind on a chair. The manager chased us down at the stop sign to return the hat. This has definitely become my must stop when I commute through the area."}
{"text":"On road trips my wife and I try to look for A&W restaurants and this one was one of the best!! It had a truly classic feel without being tacky, it was clean and the manager (maybe owner?) delivered our tray and was wiping tables. The food & root beer on tap was also great! After receiving the standard frosted glass mugs, the burgers weren't messy with sauces and I've never had a hamburger with such perfection with the hamburger ad ons, like onions, pickles, etc. The other A&Ws we've been to have given out plastic mugs :( this place was great!!"}
{"text":"Stopped around 4:00pm today on my way home.  Haven't had a burger from there in a long time.  Just as good as I remember.  And the ladies that were in the drive thru were very pleasant also!  Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"Classic, just like you remember.,,,,  Perhaps, like me, you remember trips to the A&W as a kid on a hot summer day to get that enormous, frosty mug of sweet, cold root beer as a special treat.  I remember agonzing over the decision, ice cream cone or frosty mug of beer (parents wouldn't let us have both).   I hadn't stopped into an A&W in a long, long, time and was looking for something a little less fast-foody on my drive south when I decided to stop at this A&W.  I've driven by it on the interstate a hundred times on my way back and forth from Minneapolis to Madison but had never before stopped in.  I got a burger and fries, which were fine, but the real treat was a real frosty mug (eat in only) that I could fill myself at the beverage counter with straight from the barrel A&W root beer.  Now that was a really something special."}
{"text":"Normally I let places like this just be. They are just fast food restaurants. But hey, this was surprisingly clean, quick, polite, and an actually pleasant experience.   The root beer straight from the tap is incredible and is the obvious highlight.  A&W food is always \"just getting the job done\"."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times now - usually after a round of golf north of Madison as we're trekking back home to the west side.  It's a nice location and easy to get to.  The food is decent.  Nothing like a good ol' hamburger to quench the hunger.  The fries portions are nice.  I like the frosty mug for your root beer (dine in) out of the tap.  That's a nice touch.  But overall, I think it's a bit pricey for what you get.  The food doesn't blow away the competition.  I never think to myself, \"I need me some A&W food\".  Most times, I'll suggest having something else along the way, but my buddies like the novelty of A&W.  You just don't see many anymore, so it's kinda cool to check in on them.  This location does a pretty good business (at least when I'm stopping in).  It never struck me as very clean.  While not \"dirty\", per se, you'll see straw wrappers on the floor and other untidy sights.  I get it - you're busy and there's a lot going on.  I can live with napkins and wrappers here or there, I understand - you'll pick them up eventually.   Will I go back?  Probably.  Will I be the one to suggest we go back?  We'll see.  I haven't yet."}
{"text":"Brian? The manager here is great. Makes sure all his clients are happy and if they need anything else with their food. Good is good, too. 4/5 but service made me give them 5/5"}
{"text":"-Tasty burger -Friendly & helpful staff -Clean restaurant -Fries mediocre  -\"Stadium cheese\" is disgusting"}
{"text":"Great place to stop by! Staff is always friendly and fast. Give military/police/fire 10% off. Clean place right off the interstate!"}
