{"text":"I went here for lunch as I work in the area and I ordered the Chicken Kabob, half salad and half rice.  The food was very good and came with an extra yogurt cucumber salad which is one of the best I have ever had and I am Iranian, the salad also had delicious pickled red onions.  The meet was flavoured very well and overall I was very happy with my meal and will for sure go back when I need to buy lunch."}
{"text":"Visiting from Hawaii and found this gem via Yelp! Fabulous food, service and so fun to share several dishes family style! Ordered lentil stew, beef, veal, chicken kebabs and even the French fries were fabulous with a dipping sauce!  The Persian owner bragged about it being the BEST Persian restaurant in Toronto--we can testify ABSOLUTELY!"}
{"text":"This place is so so good. I tried their rice with chicken and veal skewers. The rice is so delicious. Not dry at all. It's fluffy and the rice absorbed all the bbq flavours and fragrance of the meat. The grilled tomato is really delicious as well. Large serving of rice, really fills you up. Would like a bit more meat if possible, for the price charged. Their fries are also quite crispy and crunchy, which I liked. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The best Persian style Kebob house in downtown TO... The \"Ghormeh Sabzi\" (traditional Persian herb stew) is absolutely amazing...  Their homemade \"Dough\" (yogurt mint drink) is just great."}
{"text":"Fresh food and friendly service! Took awhile to get our food, but portions are a pretty good size."}
{"text":"I have yet to write a Yelp review, but feel compelled to after the wonderful experience I had here earlier today. After asking if my friend and I were here for the first time, and seeing that it was, the friendly owner/manager proceeded to tell us in detail all the options available for the day. He also offered to give us different combinations so we could try as many different things as possible.  We ended up with a plate of white rice with lamb shank, another with chelo chicken and eggplant on the side, and a third plate of two different rice-- one with vegetables and tomato sauce and another with saffron and nuts. He counted this as two meals ($12 each, including tax), and so we also each got a yogurt, one mixed with cucumber, and another with eggplant. At one point during our meal, he also came out with a complimentary eggplant dish, with bread on the side.  It was a LOT of food, but it was all SO delicious we could not help but devour it all. Each kind of rice was flavorful, my favorite was the saffron one. Both eggplant dishes were wonderful, especially the side, which was ground with dried Egyptian mint. The chicken and sauce, which also contained potatoes, was flavorful and tasted delicious with the different rices. My absolute favorite part of the meal, however, was the lamb shank- it was cooked to perfection, absolutely melteddd in my mouth. Its sauce also blended wonderfully with the white rice, and the yogurt was a nice touch to it all.  Various members of the kitchen checked up on us every now and then, asking how we liked the food, everyone was incredibly friendly. I would recommend this wonderful new place (it has only been open for two months) to anyone in the area, or even those not-- it is worth the trip.  One final note-- all the meats are HALAL, which is a big bonus for anyone looking for that specifically."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place on my lunch break and after seeing a few great reviews on Yelp decided to give it a try. It's a very small, casual spot offering a great variety of meat platters and sandwiches (chicken, lamb & beef). Asked the owner for some suggestions and decided to go for the minced beef sandwich. What I like about this place the most, is that meat is grilled right in front of you, so you don't have to worry about how long it's been sitting there. All the ingredients both meat and the veggies were fresh and crispy. The meat was beautifully spiced, quite juicy and grilled to perfection.  I also added Sumac sauce to my sandwich for extra flavor. The sandwich is quite big, so they had to slice it in half and wrap it separately. It feels like you are getting two sandwiches for the price of one. I enjoyed my order and thought that it was great value for the money. Also, the staff was quite friendly and welcoming making the whole experience even better.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!  A friend and I ordered the same meals, and after waiting for half an hour, they had only prepared one of the two meals we had ordered.  On top of that, when my friend asked for his money back, the man at the cash register said no and that he would just have to wait for his food and did not offer any apology for the delay!  As well, the food is pricey and the portion sizes are quite small.  Do yourself a favour and save your hard-earned money and avoid this place at all costs!"}
{"text":"I work in this area and rarely go out to eat, but when I do, I mostly come here for lunch. I have been here many times and used their food to cater my office lunches as well. I have never had a bad meal here.   I have tried pretty much all of their meats and they're all great. They're freshly made and marinated; never frozen (I checked with their employee). All the meat is made to order so it taste great off the grill. I love the fact that they have a chicken breast option for those who stick to leaner proteins. Their rice is so good that it can be addicting (not dry, contrary to what another Yelper said).  Price here is reasonable as well. For $11, you can get their chicken breast option, which is rice (huge portion), 1 skewer, grilled tomato, and choice of salad or yogurt. Other items range from $8-15. You can also get their plate options in a sandwich form, which is delicious as well."}
{"text":"We tried tah-dig gheyme and koobide. They were both tasty. Staff were super nice and the prices were quite reasonable.  This is my regular go to for gheyme/ghorme sabzi pickup when I feel lazy to cook. I won't recommend their yogurt drink though it tasted weird for dough."}
{"text":"I was excited to hear that a Persian restaurant has opened up near my office! I took my co-worker there for lunch and we had a really great experience. This place is really cute and modern with a small amount of seating. The kabob was really good! The rice with saffron is fantastic. I cant wait to go here again for lunch."}
{"text":"Sumac is my go-to casual Persian in this neighborhood. The owners are super friendly, operate efficiently, and I have never been disappointed by the food. In a sea of Asian and generic nonsense, take a chance and give it a try. You'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Tried this place recently after passing by it numerous times. I ordered the chicken kebab and had to wait ages for it. When I did get my meal, it was extremely dry, tasteless and way overpriced for what you get. Definitely won't be bothering with this place again."}
{"text":"The chickens taste like burned plastic rice is like plastic too no taste at all spices are very bad by the way for the price I paid it's too much for worst kebab restaurant ever."}
{"text":"Probably the most delicious kababs I've had in a while. The koobideh (beef kabab) is tender, juicy and flavourful. The difference that I noticed is that the kabab is made with onions as an ingredient.   I like how warm bread is also served, instead of dried pita bread, which I often see at Persian restaurants. The washrooms were clean, which is a good sign of the general cleanliness of the restaurant.   What I also appreciated was the staff. The waitresses, who could have also been the owners, are like anyone's mom.   My only complaint is that the prices are too high. A few dollars less and this otherwise great restaurant will have prices on par with other Persian restaurants."}
{"text":"I came here for a weekday lunch with my friend to try something different as there are not a lot of Persian cuisines around the University/Dundas area.    My friend ordered a platter (cannot recall the name) with a skewer of beef (Koobideh - minced beef), a skewer of chicken, charred whole tomato and rice.  The person working behind the counter did let us know that the platter did not come with a salad as shown on the menu screens above.  Cost of the meal was around $19+tax which is quite pricey relative to other Middle Eastern take out places in the area. Despite the cost, the meat was cooked well.   I had the hormeh Sabzi which was well seasoned - you could definitely taste the herbs that was used.  Comparing based on food volume and cost, this was again a let down.  If I had to go back to this place again, I would definitely not order the two dishes noted above.  It seems like there are better lunch deals (i.e. sandwiches, wraps, poutines)."}
{"text":"The Ground Beef Kebobs grilled to doness yet still very tender and juciy. The rice was highly seasoned but paired prefectly with the meat and cucumber yogurt. I will definitely return to newly open place for another tasty meal."}
{"text":"Protein, salad and a bit of spice were the requirements for our Friday girl's night. It was my girlfriend's first time having Persian food and Sumac Kebab Kitchen was a good teaser.   The main floor of Sumac is a take-out frontier, designed for the grab and goers. The second floor is the hidden nest for eat in diners. After ordering and paying for food downstairs, you can take a seat in your choice of curved wooden booths, cushioned bench chairs, or the royal table. Yes, the royal table - exactly as you imagine, a 3 meter long table with one valet chair at each end.   We ordered the Vaziri plate, a menu item created for the indecisive foodies such as ourselves. It's a mix of chicken and beef grilled to perfection - moist, tender and seasoned well. It comes on a generous bed of rice with butter, and a choice between cucumber and tomato salad, or leafy greens ~$14 a plate.   Ran into a friendly visitor from SF and he agreed Sumac was a winning find. Eat here."}
{"text":"This was a strictly grab and go expedition which proved to be wise as on a day with sweltering heat the seating area with all the windows had unbearable heat. The menu is straight forward provided you are familiar with this cuisine.  A good sign was the raw marinated meat was sitting in a cooler up front and items are grilled to order. We ordered a combo of Kobbiedeh (minced beef) and chicken breast combo and a single order of chicken. We added in a couple of orders of salads as well. After a 10-15 min wait (expected as this is grilled to order) we were on our way with boxes of food.  The mains come with a generous portion of rice (decent) a grilled whole tomato (not the greatest fan of this as its always unseasoned). There was yogurt mix side as well to balance the dry approach of this cuisine towards grilled food. Kobbideh was just average (maybe I should have asked for Sumac). The meat was bit too lean for my liking.  The chicken was pretty bland as well though it did appeal to my fellow diners.  Just average IMO but a welcome relief in this stretch of below average restaurants. They do deliver as well so if you don't want to hang around here this is a viable option.  3 Stars mainly due to the location."}
{"text":"Hello everyone,  The Food here is not clean..  I had a horrible experience here.  Way over price for cheap quality food.  Words can't even describe how disgusting the food is here.  Please everyone stay away from this place if you want to stay healthy...  there is much better Persian food in the city."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for some time and out of hunger and lack of other options I finally gave it a go.  Cut to the chase, the soup was lukewarm, rice was cold, chicken kebab was fine and though i imagined it to have just come off the grill, it wasn't very hot?? The yogurt on the side was was delicious and  i really enjoyed the grilled tomatoes.   my friend ordered the veal&chicken kebab and could barely eat the veal. For the amount of food you get, i wouldn't have minded the price if the execution was better, but it wasn't worth it.  Few hours later and we were so hungry again.    wouldn't come back & really wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"The food is decent and the staff are sweet. I tried kashke bademjoon and soltani. They were both good and reasonably priced. It is conveniently located near u of t, so expect to see lot of student if you are going for lunch midweek. I would try them again if I am around and craving for a simple persian food"}
{"text":"The food is Great . Personally, I love the Soltani Kebab there's something about the sauce. It keeps me wondering what's in it, Lol. You have to try that out .Also,upstairs is a very lovely place to spend a nice evening with your close friends."}
{"text":"I live near Yonge/Finch and have access to many Kebob places in Iranian town. The problem I always had with Iranian food is they hardly have any stores downtown when I have a craving. So I was really excited to learn this place opened.   However, after trying this place once, I don't think I would go again. The main reason is just price. In Iranian town I can get a Viziri (Chicken kebob + Koobideh + Rice + Tomato + a drink) for just $10.99. At Sumac, they charge you $15 for the same thing and MINUS the drink. That's like 50% more expensive. I don't taste the difference vs all the Iranian grill places in Iranian town. I've tried nearly all kebob places near Yonge/Steeles and frankly, most of the quality is about the same. There's a very standard recipe for kebobs and most places are on point. Most places use a charcoal grill. So when you price your items almost 50% more for the same thing, I don't feel like going again.   I think you can price better by getting more efficient packaging? They use the nice plastic boxes instead of the styrofoam boxes that most Iranian places used. They also don't give you sumac spice in packets, but in little plastic containers which is probably costing them extra. Also, I don't need a napkin/salt/utensil package. Just put a tray of plastic forks/knifes/spoons for customers to take themselves like every other Iranian place. I love Kebobs but I'm not paying $15+ tax for just rice and 2 skewers when I can get the same thing near my house for much lower price."}
{"text":"Food is ok but only heated, not cooked fresh which is not how kebabs are supposed to be made...also pretty expensive for what is being offered....even really nice Persian restaurants usually charge less for the same dishes..."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Persian cuisines I've been to in Toronto. The workers are friendly and offered us extra yoghurt when the accidentally switched our sides. Food is great and healthier than other Persian food I've had.  Overall a great place for a quick and fulfilling bite!"}
{"text":"Super fresh and tasty. Very clean restaurant. Only 3 tables. Kebabs were fantastic. I highly recommend. Combo #1 with chicken and veal. You get a taste of everything. Easily shareable between 2 people."}
{"text":"For me knowing Persians families I know Persian food and as I am Canadian it's one of the BEST restaurants I ate at. Tender kebab and its made fresh. I like how I get the choice of yogurt or salad. My fave is garlic yogurt so ask for extra!"}
{"text":"This is the definition of Persian food. We just finished our lunch here and it was perfect!!!!!  Update: went there again for all meals except breakfast a few weekends ago. Still perfect!"}
{"text":"Been there once, and today we're going to have lunch over there. Love the taste of food. Clean place in a good location. Amazing Persian restaurant."}
{"text":"I had the best ghorme sabzi of the city here ... I tried it once and hope it's good all the time because I will go there again for sure.  My friend had kobide but it wasn't our favorite. Maybe because we were so happy with our Ghorme Sabzi :)"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch with a few co-workers, one of whom recommended us to come here. There are seating in the upstairs and a patio-like area in the back. This place can definitely seat more than it seems  FOOD: I ordered the chicken breast kebab with rice and salad. Because I haven't had many good chicken breast kebabs, I have to say this was the best one I've ever had. It wasn't dry and the seasoning was just right. The rice was very fragrant and you can add more sumac if preferred. Fresh vegetables for the salad and you get a delicious grilled tomato. Their best seller is the ground beef kebab which I have to say is better than the chicken. So try the beef kebab!  SERVICE: We were served quickly considering we had a group of 6. You pay for your food and go sit down. Their service was decent and we did not think to pay tip since we paid for our meal first. I personally think they deserve some tip.  All in all a very good experience of delicious kebabs. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and service has been hit/miss each time Loved the lamb and dill bean rice."}
{"text":"This place recently opened up on near Dundas and Mccaul. From my experience and what others have told me I'll for sure be coming back.  I only tried their chicken Kebab so far. It was a mix of a kebab and a sub. I enjoyed it but next time I'll try something different. It was better than Subway or Mr.Sub but nothing amazing.   Talking to other people they really enjoyed their chicken and rice dishes which I'll order next time."}
{"text":"My colleague and I seem to have a knack for coordinating our meetings downtown just in time for us to go for lunch and try out new restaurants!  Sumac Kebab was our pick this time and we were both in the mood for some koobideh!  When you walk in, there only a few tables and I suspect that the majority of their business is takeaway. There is however, seating upstairs and since we preferred to eat in, we placed our order and up we went.   We both chose to have the sultani kebab which consists of one strip of koobideh and one strip of barg. The meal comes with rice, grilled tomato and a small side salad. I switched out my rice for the delicious dill and fava bean rice... oh how I love that rice!  The meat was cooked perfectly and the flavours were spot on. There service was quick and friendly. If I worked in this area I would be here all the time!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday. The people are friendly. The rice was dry (not a surprise) and without salt. The salad came without dressing, which is fine if you're on a diet. The veal kebab was great if a little cold, given it just grilled. The veal really saved the meal. Not a great tasting meal overall and the price for the serving size is just too high. Quite disappointing. There is lots of potential here."}
{"text":"Great quality food and great customer service and descent prices. Great location in down town Toronto. Highly recommended for anyone visiting down town Toronto."}
{"text":"Located near the AGO, this is a good place to come for a convenient, no-fuss Persian meal. There is a nice dining area upstairs with some neat looking clay-work wall decorations depicting traditional Persian lifestyle.  For my choice, I had something new to me. It was this herb stew called a Ghormeh Sabzi which I read is well-known around Iran. The meal came with a salad that I felt counter the flavor of the stew, in a light tasting way. The flavor of the stew was good enough but if the rice had some seasoning it would have been a really great flavor combination.   But the bright orange distinct looking sign outside is a enough to attract the attention of passersby that I might want to come back to try the kebabs and grilled meat sandwiches."}
{"text":"We had the Zereskh Polo ba Morgh (chicken with barberry rice) - the chicken was extremely tender and juicy, with tasty gravy on top. The rice was also great quality and had fresh barberry. All in all great dish for $11! Would highly recommend. There's also ample seating upstairs, but seems great for takeaway as well."}
{"text":"Paid $20+for the veal and beef kebab meal. Should have listened to reviews. Too overpriced. Not good value for money. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Well, I tried Vaziri kebob, and everything on the plate had little taste to it, it was pretty mediocre. Pamier Kabob is way better, imho."}
{"text":"Food was clean and tasty. If you're looking for clean tasting \"real food\" - come here. Yeah, it may look a little rough around the edges yet the food is tasty!   Had the Sumac Special with a skewer of chicken veal, minced beef, with rice and a grilled tomato -- this was tasty and definitely Mediterranean! The chicken was well cooked yet still juicy along with the other meat. The rice arrived with butter on the side which is great!   Up the stairs opens up to more seating area, however, it's warm and a little dark so I was glad the table by the entrance was available.   It's a delight!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service, and hot to order dishes so be prepared to wait a few extra minutes. From the outside it looks like small, limited-seating fast food joint, but they have an upstairs seating area that is private and quite romantic - dim lighting with a great view and benched booths. We were even offered tea since we stayed upstairs for awhile dining. Food was excellent and prices were very reasonable. Would come back here again soon!"}
{"text":"Little Persian/Iranian restaurant serving your typical combination of rice and meat. But they also have other traditional stew dishes, sandwiches/burgers, and salads.   Overall the food was fine, but the price is a bit high for what you get. For $13-15, you get a skewer of meat (like chicken, veal, koobideh) which comes with rice and a roasted tomato. Unfortunately, they don't allow you to switch your carbs to a salad, thus forcing you to pay an additional $3, for a salad and yogurt. That works out to be almost $20 with a soda... a bit pricey given this is more of a take-out fast food joint.   The food is alright. Pretty average, typical Persian food. The skewers are all quite fresh, tomatoes are BBQ'd fresh. Your rice and meat dishes come with a bit of butter for your to add to your meal too. Also... the amount of rice they give is HYYUUGGGEE. If you're hungry, this is perf for you!   Although this place seems mostly to be a takeout joint, they do have a couple tables and some bar chairs available if you'd like to sit in.  Credit card is accepted here!"}
{"text":"Somewhere between 3 and 4 stars. Food was good just not warm enough. I had the rice and chicken kabob. I enjoyed the included side salad which has an Iranian name to it(cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, onions and lemon juice). The ground floor looks like a standard limited seating takeout joint but there is a seating area upstairs with nice and wide benches and tables. The two men who operated the restaurant were warm and friendly and were quite efficient."}
{"text":"Persian food is a fave of mine. I'm into saffron rice and any type of grilled meat. We stopped in here for a quick bite before visiting the AGO which has free admission on Wednesday nights after 6pm. We ordered a beef kabob sandwich with fries which was huge! I had a mixed veal and chicken plate with tomato and cucumber salad and saffron rice. I enjoyed my meal and the meat was cooked perfectly. My pet peeve is dry chicken or overcooked meat. I'd recommend this place for a solid grab n go lunch or take-out dinner."}
{"text":"Popped in here for dinner one evening, and was pleased with the food quality, given that it's pretty much a glorified fast food joint. I didn't find the guy behind the counter to be particularly friendly, and found myself questioning if I would catch food poisoning from the food while waiting for my take out order, but thankfully I didn't fall sick, and the food hit the spot.   I would recommend Sumac if you're in a pinch for something quick and are looking for some decent Persian food. Don't expect to be blown away, just satisfied, which is good enough for an average Wednesday or Thursday night."}
{"text":"The only time I have time to write reviews for take out is if I'm slow getting my food.  Slow. I ordered a sandwich and they made it fresh. But its still just a sandwich....  I hope it tastes good.  The combo is 8$ for a sandwich and fries or a drink. I tried to get a salad substitute but no can do. I think fries or salad would be better for business for them because then I would buy a drink anyways.  Anyways I'm pretty bored and its pretty slow. Sigh. And no place to sit.  I'm not going to come back for take out again. As others have said, it takes 10-15 for take out. That's way too damn long!  They are new so maybe they're just working out the kinks.."}
{"text":"Great place for Persian food, large portions, amazing quality, and very authentic ...competitive prices compared to other places. If you want to try persian food, I'd recommend this place over others."}
{"text":"Overall quality is good, and great staffs. Nice area, cozy and friendly, cheaper than a most of Persian restaurant, but quality is acceptable."}
{"text":"The kebab dish ( chicken & veal)was great, fresh & juicy. Upper floor was cute & cozy. Counterperson was nice & friendly. I would definitely go back to this restaurant whenever im in downtown."}
{"text":"This is my second time and third for my husband at Sumac.   We had their:  Koobideh (beef kebabs) - it's always a winner on taste and doneness. It's super flavorful, great texture and juicy! You have an option to pair your meal with salad or yogurt, both are fantastic. However if you opt for yogurt, try out the smoked eggplant yogurt, it has a really nice smokey flavor. The cucumber yogurt is refreshing if that is what you're looking for.  Eggplant stew - pair it with their special rice (rice, pistachio and barberrries), it's amazing with a hint of tartness from the dried berries. A really nice vegetarian option; super tasty!  The service at this place is top notch and super friendly. The seating area at the top is nice and spacious, and it's great for dining in or take out."}
{"text":"Visited this place over the weekend and ordered the chicken and beef kebab combo which came with rice and salad. The Iranian owner was friendly and made the kebabs fresh upon ordering. Although the kebabs were fairly good, I feel they lacked seasoning and didn't have much flavour. The rice and garden salad were both fresh and overall for around $15 it was a solid meal."}
{"text":"Pretty good addition to the neighbourhood but they need to work on consistency. The delivery versions wasn't as good as when I ate there."}
{"text":"A place with reasonably priced Persian food, especially good for takeout. The Soltani was excellent! A piece or two of bread, and some onion were the only things missing."}
{"text":"My cousins & I were starving so we decided to check this out. The portions are very small & the kebab was almost tasteless. The tomato was grilled on the outside but we saw it was frozen on the inside! It wasn't even fresh. Not impressed & I came all the way from New York"}
{"text":"3 stars here - just because its decent. Nothing to write home about and nothing to rave about but the food and service are decent. I have eaten here twice and I will certainly go back if im downtown and craving Persian food.  My first time saw me getting the Gormeh Sabzi with rice. It was quite good and filling. The portion was big enough for 2.  The second time there, I got the lamb shank - again pretty decent and quite tender. I converted this into two meals. Extra points for the free tea with your meal - I do recommend having a hot tea-  you really do need to wash down the food as it is rather heavy in terms of fat.  The portion size here is good, staff is friendly and nice. They have a yoghurt sauce that they serve with the meals as well that is quite nice but needs to be seasoned. Ask for the tadig with your meal - it's the crispy rice from the bottom of the dish. It's ok here - I prefer when it is really golden brown"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Got the vaziri plate for $17 with tax and tip it's $21. Should of got the koobiden kebab sandwich for $9.50 as it comes with fries and drink.  There was a sticky note covering the original price. Vaziri comes with chicken and minced kebab. The chicken wasn't that juicey compared to other places I've tried before. But not bad..  However I did like the minced beef a lot. Tender and full flavour. Came with slice lime, lots of rice (doesn't look like safforn) and a whole roasted tomatoe.  Overall it was good and I would recommend but would not pay that much for a lunch next time. Yes I'll be back lol.."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars.   Pros: Food portion size is great. We got the veggie sumac and the veal combo and there's plenty of rice but not as much of the other stuff proportionally. Food is also very flavourful.  There's also a second floor with plenty of space and nice lighting.   Con: Service is slow. There's too much rice compared to the other items on the plate. And it's also a bit on the pricier end.   Would recommend if you're really craving middle eastern food but it wouldn't be a must go-to in the area."}
{"text":"I have been looking for somewhere Persian downtown and I finally found the place. Delicious food and great customer service. The portions look small but very filling. Will be going back soon"}
{"text":"Like any hot-blooded Canadian girl, I get a hankering for Persian food every so often. However, I used to get it at Yonge & Steeles (an area which some have creatively named \"Tehranto\" - hee!) and that's no longer feasible, because I got rid of my car when I moved downtown.  That's why I was super delighted to see Sumac's sign going up when construction started!  The food is a little more expensive than Yonge & Steeles/Finch, but if you factor in the two subway tokens, it works out to be the same - plus I save a lot of time eating down here. The quality of the food is pretty good. Not the best I've ever had, but will absolutely do when I'm craving Persian food. It could be a little dry and they don't always give you butter/margarine for your rice - plus I've never gotten a wedge of lemon or, in fact, any sumac to sprinkle on top - but all things considered, the food here is solid. Everything is grilled fresh when you order it. Their Sumac salad, with the minty dressing, is fantastic - their veggies are always very fresh. I've never tried the stews but I'd like to!   This place is in a unique position because their competitiors in downtown Toronto are too formal and far away (Sheherezade/Pomegranate) or too formal and don't offer dark meat for their grilled chicken (Darvish), and ain't nobody got time for desert-dry grilled chicken breast!  I will happily continue to return."}
