{"text":"The view is great, like the other restaurants in Grandview but the exterior of the building is very deceiving. You wouldn't know how great this place is, even though small, from the inside if you just see it from the outside.   We went here for the first time for my boyfriend's 30th birthday to try the chef's tasting. The staff was nice and they even gave us champagne to celebrate the occasion. I can't give enough praise about the food.   We ordered different things off the 7 course meal so we ended up trying 2 out of the 3 options. It was like a journey, the menu was planned well. My favorite would be the scallop for the appetizer, the halibut for the fish course, and I can't praise the duck enough! The papaya sorbet after the fish course was a good palate cleanser before the meat entree. Even the NY strip steak was unbelievable. For desserts, i recommend the blueberry and white chocolate, I didn't like the chocolate one as much since the chocolate tart pastry that holds the ganache is a bit hard.  The meal is well worth it, proportion is about right not to make you too full for the next course. We will definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"We went there last night for a surprise anniversary dinner the husband had organized! I had no idea what was transpiring, and spent a few minutes telling him there were no good restaurants on Mt Washington and we should go back to Shadyside to eat.  Imagine my surprise- we are vegetarians with other dietary restrictions, and the chef at Isabela had apparently decided to indulge my husband's vegetarian-no eggs-little garlic-and please no Eggplant for main course request.   We had a delightful seven course vegetarian meal, starting with the amuse bouche (mango slices in some kind of ginger-lemon-rosemary sauce). The butternut squash gratin was fair, but the roasted pumpkin with pomegranate that followed was delightful. The pomegranate cinnamon sorbet was excellent. The salad was alright. The dessert- Dark Chocolate tamarind Pot de Creme  with Sweet Chili Caviar was perfect.  What stood out was the main course of polenta with wild mushroom ragu and green peppercorns- sublime.   The service was attentive but not gushing. Not prepared for the fancy dinner, I was in jeans and a nice shirt, but did not feel awkward. The view is amazing and the wine list is decent.   In all, it was more about the whole experience than the food- we'd go there again!"}
{"text":"Let's be honest, in a place like this, you are paying for the view - and Isabella's delivers.   Food was good, but nothing out of this world for such high prices (75 per person). My biggest complaint was the inconsistency in, well - everything. I went here with my girlfriend while we were strolling by. Again the view is amazing, and the owner was friendly, but the salmon was on par with the frozen stuff from the grocery store while the steak was very good (received rare instead of medium rare). Cheese plate with delicious cheese had seemingly random accompaniments, and the waitress forgot my beer.   All these things can be overlooked for a 20-30 dollar meal but not at 70-80 dollars per person. I recommend saving your money and going to Le Mont down the street for a better value."}
{"text":"For all the hype, was very disappointed with the experience. The beautiful view does not make up for the poor food. As vegetarians, we never expect much while fine dining but we did expect much more from this place. Had to pay the fixed price for basically five types of salads, which were extremely small by the way. The food is definitely overpriced for the portions and the service was also poor. Our waiter only appeared about twice, while other servers brought our food, cleared our plates, and even took our bill. Having our picture taken was a nice gesture except no one knew how to properly use a camera and we ended up with a blurry photograph. Sadly disappointed because I really wanted to like Isabela."}
{"text":"Closed! Not disappointed, either. Was there for a birthday dinner two years ago (memorable only for the company!). Food was unremarkable. \"Owner\" came by mid meal to introduce himself as the \"proprietor.\" I'm a friendly person, but I found his particular greeting to be a bit strange. I don't mean to be harsh - I appreciate the chef asking how we we like his/her creations, the manager checking to make sure service is good, but this was on the creepy end of the scale. But the piece de resistance, was that the dessert was awful. And this from a person who has admittedly never met a dessert she didn't like! (And what a horrible impression to leave your diner with!). Regardless, not sad to bid Isabella adieu, and hoping another fine dining establishment joins the neighborhood, now that the space is available. (I'm new here - can I give a half star?)"}
{"text":"The food was great, and unique - we were able to try frog legs, bison ribs, rabbit and homemade sorbet across the 7 course \"prix fixe\" menu  But what really stuck out was the service (and of course, the view)  Came for a very special occasion - they went above and beyond to accommodate, made positive that everything went off without a hitch, and made it a personalized, fantastic experience.  If you're planning any sort of special night, without question Isabela should be on your list!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great view!!! We were especially pleased that they have special menus for food preferences and allergies, such as vegan, vegetarian and gluten free. Three of us ordered the vegan selections and our son ordered off the regular menu. He felt the food was as good as the best he's had in LA, and not at LA prices. We will make Isabela a habit every time we are in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Ate here with a group of six for New Years Eve last night.  Salad was pretty ordinary, but otherwise the seven course meal was truly outstanding and the service was tremendous.  Easily the best meal that we've had in Pittsburgh.  We also did the wine pairing, which was excellent as well, and reasonably priced (a glass of champagne and four glasses of wine)."}
{"text":"There is something about Isabela that feels truly special, from the moment we walked in and were humbly greeted by the owner, who then took our picture to keep as a memento once we were settled. I definitely recommend a window seat on the 2nd floor, the view is breathtaking! We only wished the lights were turned down just a bit, the glare only took away from the gorgeous skyline. It's hard to recommend dishes 'cuz I know the menu will change (it was COMPLETELY different from the website) but what I can tell you is to get the 7 course tasting menu. The fish/meats were perfectly cooked (curry duck, lobster,arctic char,sirloin) & desserts were spectacular (passion fruit cake, chocolate rosemary mousse). Service was also very memorable. At one point, my boyfriend got up to use the men's room and the waiter came by, re-folded his napkin and placed it on the table. You can also see the two chefs servicing the whole restaurant in  the kitchen, which was also very cool...."}
{"text":"This restaurant will find no shortage of rave reviews.  They know most people come here to celebrate a special occasion.  The beautiful Pittsburgh skyline at night, is an amazing backdrop for dinner.  And the staff is excellent in complementing the evening with friendly service.  The $70/per chef's tasting was pretty good.  Each selection, apps, fish, meat, and desert have 3 choices, so if you're with another person, you'll likely get 2 out of 3 dishes offered.  Some of the flavor profiles were pretty great, but a tad salty for our tastes.  One of our fish dishes was the Cobia, and we sent it back because we thought it was still frozen.  We're not sure - we were told it was cooked to medium-rare, but we couldn't even cut through the fish - and it was ice cold in the middle.  So I still don't know if it wasn't cooked right, or we just don't know how to eat Cobia.    Some other hiccups in the service, included the wrong glass of wine, and actually the wrong meat course.  I had ordered the lamb but got the short rib.  I didn't say anything about the short rib, because, c'mon, who doesn't love short rib? Regardless, that many mistakes from such a high-end restaurant is surprising and disappointing.  We still had a very pleasant experience, but I think felt a little wanting for more of a wow factor from the food.    ------------ Appetizer - Choice of One Scallops - Nantucket Bay Scallops, Diver Sea Scallop, Cauliflower, Breadcrumbs Parsnip, Leek & Ginger Soup - Toasted Pepitas, Pumpkin Oil Ricotta Ravioli - Hedgehog mushrooms, Black Truffle, Hickory Smoked Chanterelle Puree  Fish Course - Choice of One North Atlantic Lobster - Melted Leeks, Red Beets, Mascarpone Risotto Cobia - Kale, Shiso, Pickled Ginger, White Soy & Yuzu Ponzu  Bass - Roasted Brussels sprouts, Golden Beet, Agro Dulche Buerre Blanc   Intermezzo - Chef's Daily Sorbet Selection   Meat Course - Choice of One Venison Rack Chop - Black Pepper Crust, Spelt Berries, Persimmon, Roasted Fennel NY Strip Steak - Salsify, Celeriac Puree, Malbec Reduction, Demi Smoked Duck Breast - Pumpkin Cavatelli, Confit of Leg, Celebration Squash, Sage, Huckleberry   Salad Organic Arugula Salad - Pears, Candied Pecans, Meadow Belle Goat Cheese, Apple Cider Vinaigrette   Dessert - Choice of one  Meyer Lemon Bar - Poppy Seed Crème Brulee, Raspberry, White Chocolate, White Corn Shortbread  Olive Oil Cake - Petite Rhubarb, Blood Orange Ice Cream, Chocolate Balsamic Chocolate Ganache - Organic Chocolate, Campfire Marshmallow, Graham Cracker Ice Cream"}
{"text":"We took the Duquesne Incline up to Mount Washington.  Great restaurant with excellent service and views of Pittsburgh.  We did the 7-course meal for $65.  It was superb - we were stuffed by the end.  Each course you get your choice out of 3-4 options and I love that since I'm picky and prefer variety.  My bf did the wine pairing and we discovered a new wine that we both enjoy.  I think the wine pairing is an additional $35-40.  A must if you go to Pittsburgh.  I can't wait to return in the fall to try out another 7-courses."}
{"text":"Food was good, but not worth the price. I have had much better food and atmosphere for about 3/4 the price. Service was good. For the food alone i would only pay about 1/4 what they charge at isabella. For the food, service and view maybe about 1/2. Overall too expensive, too small and cramped, not great food, not worth the money. Would not go back. Oh and i have told isabella this twice with no response, so they apparently don't care."}
{"text":"really i would say 4 1/2  we thought this place lived up to it's billing as romantic. we went for our 1st anniversary. we have only been in pittsburgh for almost a year, but coming from boston we have a pretty good idea of how it should be done.   shortly after arrival we were greeted by the owner ,who brought us a glass of complimentary champagne because of our \"special occasion\", later he came by and took our picture, which he gave to us later in the meal, also complimentary. these little things, plus the view and the great food, really made the dinner feel \"special,\" which is the whole idea when you go out for a special occasion, right?  the view really is great. next time we go back we will go after dark. even in broad daylight the view is spectacular.   we did the prixe fixe meals, which did not dissappoint. each course played off each other well. we weren't stuffed at the end, but we were not hungry either. the pace at which everything came out was perfect. not the best, best food we've ever had, but still very good. overall, it was just a seamless, relaxing, and enjoyable experience.   we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Don't come hungry.  We took the incline and looked for a place to dine near by for a nice dinner with a view.  The waitress was lovely and explained the $75 course tasting menu and I swear she said the portions were smaller (4 oz protein) as you got 4 entrees so my assumption was the other side of the menu where you could order what you wanted would be a normal dinner size...I was hungry so ordered the duck for $27, which is a splurge for me.  When my plate arrived I had a piece of duck the size of an egg roll (and I am being generous).  I looked at the waitress and said 'Is that it? I didn't order the tasting menu'  She said yes...the tasting menu and ala carte were smaller portion sizes....so where was my DINNER??  smaller than what?  what you USUALLY get at a restaurant for $27? I think it was tasty...I really didn't have enough to tell....the waitress offered me more bread...I didn't want bread...I wanted duck!  I came home and snacked on everything I could get my hands on as did my husband who had a 2 1/2 inch square piece of fish.  I know there is a markup, but duck doesn't cost close to $100 a lb! Nouvelle cuisine??? How about FEED your patrons. I shouldn't have to spend $75 to feel satisfied."}
{"text":"We had prix fixe menu.  Most items were excellent, but the scallops left much to be desired."}
{"text":"Definitely eat here! Great view. Great food. Very Romantic.  My girlfriend of 4 years and I came to Isabela on Grandview on January 17th for her birthday.  We loved it!!!  It was like they served each course at the perfect time.    Both of us got the seven course meal and we decided on the wine pairing too.  Plus,  a complimentary glass of birthday Champagne.  Each dish was pretty and delicious.    Each portion was small but with a 4 different glass of wine with the main courses. We had just enough.  Mmm.   I cant wait to come back,     It was neat to see the kitchen from our seats and romantic music was a plus.  Special thanks to Ene the Host,  Courtney and Justin our servers,  Mr and Mrs Cook, and the owner, George, introduced himself and provided us with a picture to take home.   Great Job."}
{"text":"This is the only place that I would recommend if you want a truly unique experience for eating in Pittsburgh. Since my husband and I happened to try this place a few years ago to celebrate our wedding anniversary, it's been our favorite place in Pittsburgh. We loved it so much, the food, the view, the service and everything, so we've been trying to make any special occasion to go there. So far, we've tried it 4 times, and their pre-fix menu with the 7 course meals never disappointed us."}
{"text":"Fantastic panoramic view of the city! Large glass windows, unbeatable service and ambiance.  The food was very spectacular. It is a flat price for a 7 course chef's tasting menu and I also opted for the wine pairing.  The food is exquisitely presented and extremely tasty.  You will feel like royalty. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I went here for my brother's rehearsal dinner before his wedding and I was blown away by how lovely Pittsburgh is.  Not at all what I expected and the view of the city at night was just beautiful.    The service was great and the food was very good, especially for a large group of people.   Strangely the setting was very romantic on the 2nd floor and the decor was a bit divey on the 1st floor.  However, the end result was very delightful."}
{"text":"I understand that you are paying for the beautiful view and that it is but the food was good but nothing more. It was quite an experience but we will not be going back. The service was great and our favorite part was the wine pairing. Great choices.   I am generally easy to please but when you are paying $75 for a seven course meal, I expect fantastic not good."}
{"text":"I took my fiancé here for his birthday dinner. We had a fantastic meal, and the whole experience was great - the views, the service, the perfect wine pairings - overall a very special restaurant. We did the Chef's tasting prix fixe, which i would suggest to others looking to try a little bit of everything. I thought the food was prepared spectacularly, with smaller portions that allow the diner to enjoy a wide range of flavors and textures, each course building on the one before. The wine pairings were spot on! I loved their use of fresh herbs and vegetables, locally sourced whenever possible. I think the soft shell crab was the tastiest I have ever eaten- crispy on the outside, sweet and juicy on the inside. They prepared it in a really unique way, dusted with a Thai-esque curry seasoning. That was just one of many delicious courses. To finish, a chocolate pot de creme topped with caramelized pear and paired with a smoky, chocolatey Madeira. All of this with the twinkling skyline of downtown Pittsburgh and the tree- lined rivers...how's that for ambiance?  Our server was really sweet, if a little robotic, loudly giving the table next to us the exact spiel she gave us, word for word. We had a very mediocre salad course, hence the one detracted star.   Next time we have a special occasion I would love to make another visit! I recommend Isabela wholeheartedly."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in the 'Burgh!!  I grew up in Pittsburgh and get back to town about once a year.  I am going to be incorporating Isabela into my annual repertoire.      This place is amazing because it somehow manages to exude fanciness without a hint of stuffiness.  George, the owner, is one of the warmest guys you will ever meet.  The food, though, is what really steals the show.  I highly recommend the prix fixe menu in order to sample the full scope of what the amazing chefs can do.  The wine list is also fabulous.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I was in Pittsburgh for a weekend get away (do not underestimate the drawing power of the Burgh) and had a chance to enjoy a few of the city's restaurants.  Isabela was not the first stop, but it was the culinary highlight up the trip.  I had the seven course \"prix fixe\" menu.  It was more like five course with a spoonful of sorbet and soup (amuse bouche).  Isabela is known for the view and I must admit it was a nice view of the city, especially after it got dark and it started to light up.  The atmosphere was nice and the staff played it up.  The seven course \"prix fixe\" menu consisted of four courses (appetizer, fish course, meat course, and dessert) with three options of which you get to choose one.  The other three courses (amuse bouche, sorbet, and salad) were the chef's choice.  The meal started off with the chef's choice of amuse bouche.  This was a spoonful of butternut squash soup.  The soup was very flavorful and seasoned well.  I would have ordered a bowl of it.  The next course was the appetizer course.  I chose the braised pork shank.  The pork came on a bed of very creamy polenta.  The pork was delicious and melt in your mouth tender.  There was also some type of hot sauce on the edge of the polenta that gave it a nice kick.  This was probably my favorite course.  Up next was the fish course.  I chose the ono, because I had been wanting to try it ever since it was the secret ingredient on Iron Chef.  It was prepared rare like I would like my tuna.  I found the ono to be a little tough and chewy in the middle where it wasn't cooked.  I don't know if this is just the way ono is or if it wasn't prepared properly or if it was a bad piece of ono.  This was not my favorite course.  The next course was the sorbet.  It was a melon sorbet that was very refreshing although they could have gave a little more.  The fifth course was the meat course  For the meat course I chose the braised beef short rib.  The beef was delicious.  Along with the pork it was my favorite part of the meal.  It came with a barbecue sauce that was more like a paste, but the texture was actually pretty good.  My one criticism is there was too much of the sauce.  This beef was more than capable of standing on its own and too much of the sauce would have just overpowered it.  Next was the salad course.  This was a tomato salad.  I am not a big fan of big tomato slices, but my SO really loved the salad.  Finally we had the dessert course.  I choose the rice pudding with pistachio.  I thought it was very good and was a nice size for a dessert of that type.  Again, very good way to end a meal.  My SO ordered different courses than I did and I had a chance to taste some of her selections.  For the meat course she ordered the pan roasted ostrich.  I have never had ostrich before and I found it to be a bit tough and gamey.  Everything else I tried was good but not great.  I definitely think I had the best selections with the pork shank and beef short rib.  The service was pretty good until the end.  For some reason while the tables around us were asked if they wanted coffee or espresso, nobody asked us.  Additionally, the tables around us who finished their meals after us, received their checks before us.  I actually had to ask for the check when one of the staff walked by our table.  Also, the owner was there and was very friendly if not a little overbearing.  He seemed to really enjoy his restaurant and wanted to make sure that everybody had a good time, but I still feel he was a little too present.  Overall it was a very good experience and I would recommend it.  I think the chefs are very talented and creative.  The price actually isn't that bad for what you get."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Pittsburgh Restaurant.  One the few places where the food actually matches the fantastic view and it is the only place in pittsburgh where you might experience a four star  meal as if you were in new york or LA.   Tasting menu is the way to go.   Excellent place to bring a date."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've ever had in Pittsburgh. Absolutely gorgeous view. I had the tasting menu with the wine pairing. Every course was great with the exception of dessert which was so-so. Bring your checkbook."}
{"text":"Great dining experience for visitors.   Of the Mt. Washington restaurants, Isabela on Grandview is my favorite (no disrespect to the other Mt. Washington restaurants...i like them too).    The restaurant is also popular for its view of the city & I would imagine a great place to watch fireworks.  The 7 course dinner is phenomenal.  Isabelas offers ingredients and dishes unique to many of the restaurants in the area.  The sorbet is refreshing and light and I especially enjoyed the seafood course.  The courses are novel and presently very stylishly."}
{"text":"No one would probably blame Isabela if they kind of skimped on an aspect or two of their restaurant. After all, their view overlooking Pittsburgh has to be one of the most incredible restaurant views in the world. But thankfully they're top notch from beginning to end.  Having arrived in the area at around 6pm with no reservation, I decided to poke my head in to see if I could get a table. To my surprise, no one was there (guess I was early). I was greeted by a very friendly and engaging hostess who got a table ready for me despite no reservation. I was seated right next to the window with the previously mentioned amazing view. This alone was worth the visit. But the food was equally worth the stop too.  My halibut was perfectly cooked in a kaffir lime sauce that was almost like green curry. Since I was doing the a-la-carte, I also ordered roasted broccolini that was perfectly roasted to a crispiness with the right amount of seasoning, and the chanterelle risotto which was absolutely divine. Service was just as friendly as the hostess, and was perfectly attentive. And prices were very reasonable given the quality of the food, level of service, and that view.  Whether you're just visiting Pittsburgh or you live there and want a nice place for a special night, Isabela on Grandview is certainly a spot to go to. I've heard that the view on the 4th of July is absolutely amazing with fireworks being shot from the river. I'll definitely return should I make my way back to Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I came here for Valentine's Day with my boyfriend.  Excellent food, service, and view.  We had the $70 prix fixe and the 4-glass wine flight.  It was the right amount of food and wine.  The owner greeted us at the door, gave me a light-up heart pin, and took our picture, which we got right away.  We were fortunate to get a corner table by the window.  A nice place for a special occasion!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had our wedding reception at Isabela on Grandview and we could not be happier with how it went.  The food was absolutely delicious and the menu was unique and creative.  The service was fantastic and we can't say enough positive things about the staff.  Isabela has wonderful food, a great view, and a stellar staff.  I'm so happy with our experience there."}
{"text":"Excellent food with a great view.  You can listen to Julia K. (below), but we've had many business guests from out of town (particularly NYC) who have all enjoyed this place.  Multi-course meal, so be prepared to take your time.  But the food is good & the view is the best in the city.  I always recommend it."}
{"text":"I wish I would have had the same experience as my Yelpmates.  My wife and I went there for our anniversary.  Even though I made a point of this when I made the reservation, we were treated like cattle. The hostess was just cold as ice. \"Sorry, we don't guarantee any table selection\"  Even though I understood this policy, we were escorted to the worst table in the place.  We could have been in a cave and had a better view of the city.  We simply got up and left. No apology, no \"George\" greeting, no special treatment of any kind.   Night ruined!  So I will NEVER patronize that restaurant again. The quality of the food might be great but, for me, the service and the experience outweight the food.  My wife keeps saying we should give it another try but I can't bring myself to agree.  There are far too many other places that want the business."}
{"text":"Very intimate restaurant. Enjoyed the seven course meal with my wife. Highly recommend for a memorable experience on mt. Washington."}
{"text":"ExThe place is very nice with a beautiful view. Had a great table. Service was very good. Did not feel rushed at all.  Appetizer and salad were delicious. I ordered the salmon and my husband ordered the NY strip steak. My salmon was beautifully cooked. However, my husband received 3 small slices. It felt more of an appetizer than an entree.  I wish restaurants would state on the menu that the customer will receive slices, not an actual steak. It is misleading. I understand they need to maximize profit, but 3 small slices? They can't throw in another slice??  I prefer delicious quality meals over large portions. When I saw my husband's plate, I knew he would be leaving hungry and we wouldn't be coming back."}
{"text":"Mixed feelings on this one.   The food was good (just good), the service okay, and the building subpar.   The 7-course prix fixe menu: Amuse bouche (lentil soup) was great, lobster risotto was a little weird (hot pink and the lobster was chewy, ever have that happen before?), the duck was okay, and the dessert (lemon poppy seed something) was fine. yes, that's only four, I already forgot what the other three were.  The service was slow (potentially expected at a nice dinner), but bordering on unattentive. My wine glass was empty for up to 10 mins at a time, as was the water. The fun part is the owner, who is a great guy, took pictures for us and gave them to us in a frame at the end of dinner.  The actual building itself is in horrible shape, although the view is amazing.   Probably will not return again, if you're going to spend this much on dinner in Pittsburgh, should go to Eleven."}
{"text":"Took my wife here for Mother's Day and from the minute we walked in to the minute we left we loved it.  Great staff, amazing food and a one of kind view.  We chose the wine flight to accompany the courses and wrote down a few of them to try again.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The bf took me here for our one year anniversary... Gotta say, what a huge disappointment. Besides the amazing view and the fact that they introduced me to my favorite wine (fyi - Dom. des Trois Toits Muscadet Sevre et Maine), Isabela is NOT 5 stars in my book.  Plain and simple: The food leaves something to be desired. Actually, it leaves a lot.  Don't get me wrong... Service was great (although I've still experienced better). It's just that the food was SO forgettable. It was so forgettable that I forgot the name of the restaurant until I went back on Yelp to look for it. For a \"5 star\" rating, I'd expect better.  I'm not from the Pitts, so I can objectively say that this is NOT a 4 or 5 star restaurant. It's an extremely overpriced 2 star restaurant (and again, I'm  talking strictly about the food here). Then again, it is in the Pitts, and the Pitts isn't a city known for its yummy fare.  Save your money and go to a cafe in Shadyside instead... then go to the Grandview Park afterwards to enjoy a nice view of the city."}
{"text":"Definitely the best meal I've had in Pittsburgh, but that certainly does come at a high cost.  The tasting menu is great and when paired with that delightful view, makes for a quite a special meal/night.  Splurge indeed but well worth it."}
{"text":"You can't complain about this view. It's really nice. The staff was friendly and helpful. They push the tasting menu pretty aggressively and with good reason; it's probably the right choice dollar for dollar. The food itself was decent. I started with a cold octopus salad. The texture of the octopus was a bit soft. Then I had a fish. The fish itself was perhaps a bit dry. Next was a duck leg. The skin was not as crispy as I expect. The dessert, a cheesecake, was good but I have had much better chocolate cheesecakes. The wine list is decent. I was disappointed by the knowledge of the staff on the wine list. They were unsure of what various (high end) bottles of wine were.   This all reads rather poorly, but it's not a bad place. Not to mention that $70 for the tasting isn't off the charts expensive. Worth visiting if you want the view, otherwise probably not."}
{"text":"We were visiting some local friends in Pittsburgh and they had mentioned that Isabela on Grandview was one of Pittsburgh's restaurants with the most spectacular view of the city.  I made reservations for the four of us at 5pm with the hopes that we would be able to enjoy a sunset while enjoying our meal.  While Mother Nature did not cooperate with us, the view of the city at night was incredible.  The menu on Saturdays is a seven course prix fixe menu that includes very unique dishes with skate, quail, bison, etc.  We complemented the dinner with a specialized flight of four wines to pair perfectly with the dishes that we ordered.  The service was outstanding providing helpful information on the wine, dishes and restaurant and yet didn't intrude on us as we enjoyed our evening with our good friends.  An unusual feature for the restaurant is the husband/wife chefs who prepare the meals in full view of the clientele.  This added a personal touch that enhanced our experience.   Just keep in mind that the dining experience will be expensive so that you are not shocked when presented with the menu and final bill.  Personally, we could not have asked for a more perfect evening and I look forward to dining here again."}
{"text":"Expensive, but the food is amazing and fun. Best restaurant on Mt. Washington!"}
{"text":"Get the 7 course meal... get the wine pairing... the best meal I ever thought would be possible in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Great experience at Isabela on Grandview.   We made a reservation online and arrived about 30 minutes early expecting to have to wait, we headed for the bar, but the nice hostess said she already had a table for us. Then we were greeted with a warm handshake by the friendly owner, George. He walked us upstairs to our table. A few minutes later George took our picture that he later brought out to us in a cardboard frame. Now that is a really nice touch! (even though pretend boyfriend and I felt we both looked awful in the photo.)   We were seated and instantly blown away with the view. You're sitting on top of Mount Washington with a panoramic view of the city. It's really stunning, especially at night. The view is what really sells this place.   For dinner, we both chose the 7 course prix fixe meal. Then decided on one wine flight to share. Neither of us were disappointed with that meal. It was very relaxing, spread out over a few hours, romantic, and delicious.   Dishes that stood out were:  - scallops tartar  - duck breast - ricotta crepes - rabbit and pork belly sausage - lamb stew  The staff were incredibly friendly and informative. (maybe a bit TOO informative on the wines -- we're not wine snobs.)   Overall, fantastic. If you're planning a special occasion in PGH, this is your place."}
{"text":"Just a wonderful experience,  We had the seven course prix fixe menu.  I wish I could remember the names off everything that we  had, but among the highlights were braised short ribs and a port tenderloin cooked to perfection. The main thing was that we dined in a very relaxed manner, trying smaller portions of some wonderful dishes.  I think for an extra $30-40 you could get wine parings with your various courses, but we chose not to indulge.  The other wonderful thing was taking the Duquesne Incline up to the restaurant which is a few doors away.  And  topping it all off was coming back down on the incline,  My boyfriend proposed to me (on his birthday no less).   I'm not saying that you will get a proposal, but you will get an outstanding meal in a beautiful space!"}
{"text":"I consider myself quite easy to please, especially with food. Now, this restaurant was a completely disappointing experience. Part of it was probably my fault - I saw $$$$ signs and automatically assumed it would offer upscale dining experience.  The view is good, probably the best in Pittsburgh, but I've lived in bigger cities, so the view itself wasn't too impressive. Now wine. My husband ordered a 2010 vintage red from the wine list. What our server brought was a 2011. She did not mention this until my husband pointed it out - from the looks of her face, I doubt she even knew about it. She said they did not have 2010 vintage, and could not offer lower price on 2011. No one came for an explanation. I thought it was unacceptable, but I did not want to disturb other customers eating in peace, so I didn't ask her further. Then the food. Scallops were ok but the broccoli was too burnt. I am aware of 'burnt broccoli' recipes, usually at home, but the menu didn't say I would be getting burnt broccoli. I honestly thought they were cauliflowers because it was too black. Then my steak...I ordered medium rare and my four pieces of ny strip sure looked like medium rare (red in the middle, pink in the outskirts)...but tasted like well done. Far from tender. My grill does a better job. Then the owner/general manager came to each table and offered to take a picture of dining guests...then he printed it out and gave it to us. it was a nice gesture, but definitely wasn't enough the make up for the less-than-impressive food. The best way to enjoy this place is to visit after dinner and have a cocktail, while enjoying the views."}
{"text":"We were exploring the city for the first time and as we were walking by, we dicided to stop in..turns out, we were the only people there.....and I have no idea why...it has a fantastic view of the city and the point....the food was exceptional and the service was very personable and friendly!  We loved it."}
{"text":"The only perfection here is the amazing view. Service is nice. Food... For a fine dining is BAD. We had a tasting menu. I really liked only one dish - lamb (which was actually undercoocked). Other dishes... Brrrr... Even I do better cooking myself"}
{"text":"We totally lucked out, choosing Isabella's for our first dinner on our first-ever trip to Pittsburgh. Lucky for us, it was a quiet Monday night and there were plenty of tables open, affording us a prime spot at the window. Yes the view is spectacular, in fact it's hard to imagine a better view of the three mighty rivers and the vibrant city that surrounds them. But even more impressive was the food.   Chef Jacqueline has created an amazing tasting menu, with inventive and sensitive dishes to delight the palate.  Dainty, crusty shrimp, delicately seasoned and cooked salmon and swordfish, delectable duck breast and lamb... We both had the tasting menu with the wine pairing, well worth the price. The wines were perfection, carefully selected and consistently excellent.  Even the coffee was exceptional, as it comes from Building New Hope coffee roasters. Server Paul was informed, attentive, genuinely pleasant, and always on the spot.  Portion sizes were certainly generous for tasting, and frankly if they had been larger, it would've almost been too much. At one point, I felt that I could just spend the rest of my life right there, looking over the Ohio River, with Paul bringing dish after dish to our table. Bravo, Isabella's."}
{"text":"Isabela is a unique restaurant.  We were staying in south side and we took the incline up to isabelas.  Was an unusual way to climb a mountain to get to dinner!  The views from isabelas can't be beat!  You feel like you are sitting on top of the world.  The pittsburgh skyline was beautiful! Seeing all the lighted bridges and buildings made you feel like you were on an airplane looking down on a magical city! You had a choice of a $75 prix fix or you could order a la carte.  We did the a la carte.  My husband had the duck and it was tender and lean...well prepared.  I had the sword fish.  It was good but slightly overcooked.  Salads were delicious as was the crispy shrimp appy.   Our server was personable and attentive without being on top of us.   They did have a wine pairing if ou chose the prix fix for $40 which was very reasonable.   Isabelas is a small intimate restaurant.  Perfect for a special occasion.  Definitely a place that foodies would enjoy!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are fairly new to Pittsburgh. His parents were in town, so we thought a nice dinner on Mt. Washington was the ticket.  I had made reservations only a few days before and had asked for good seating since you come to these places for the view.  When we got there, we ended up being seated at one of the inside tables, rather than a window seat.  Maybe you have to reserve way in advance to get a window seat? Oh well.   Our service was a little strange for the price point.  Our server explained the portions were a bit smaller, so we might want to order extra food.  That seemed a little unnecessary- almost apologetic?- as I found the portions to be about what you'd expect from a fine dining restaurant. We did follow her advice and get a few appetizers. We also had to ask our server for a wine list, get her attention to order said bottle of wine, ask her if we could order dessert.  Again- I think for the price point, your server should know that you want wine or cocktails. Maybe it's just me, but it makes me feel awkward- almost asking permission to order something \"extra\"?  I think the general consensus in town is that Mt. Washington is no longer the neighborhood for cutting-edge cuisine. The food at Isabela was good, but nothing too memorable. I got salmon with couscous and brussel sprouts- something you could get just about anywhere. My father in law did get a fantastic pork roast that we all sampled. It was juicy and falling-apart-tender, but again- nothing I couldn't make at home in my crockpot.   I did enjoy the kitchen being on view in the second-floor dining area, but it added to the noise level.  This dining room is fairly small (8 tables, maybe?) and the sound really filled the room.  That's not necessarily something I mind, but it can be tough if you're dining with anyone hard of hearing (as we were.)"}
{"text":"In an area known for price gouging in exchange for breathtaking views, Isabela is refreshing.  You certainly get the view, but amazingly you also get great service and well-executed dishes.  The chef presents a tasting menu (slightly different every day but more or less seasonal) of seven(I think) courses, of which you choose three from three options.  Each was thoughtful and not too busy--just elegant with great flavors.  Even the incredibly picky eaters (\"eww, that cheese came from a goat!?!\" --I'm not kidding) were happily surprised with their selections. I will admit that when I saw that there were some Asian-influenced items I winced.  Fusion is a fad, not a manner of displaying real culinary talent.  But those dishes weren't fusion, they were traditional techniques that used  Asian ingredients to enhance an established concept.  And it worked beautifully.  The service was great--our server was there when we needed her and never when we didn't.  She anticipated our needs and even handled a sticky \"re-cook\" situation with poise and grace.  We arrived about 20 minutes before the place was actually open, and she made us feel welcome, and actually chatted with us for a moment or two.  Normally this would be a down-point, but she was very polite and didn't make it seem like she was trying to \"buddy up\" with us (my #1 peeve). The family who runs the restaurant is warm, friendly, and eager to tell you anything they can about the restaurant.  That they love what they're doing comes through with every action.  The actual ambiance of the restaurant is a little unusual, but fascinating.  The entire free-standing building used to be a home long ago, then it was a show home for the condominium building across the street.  It was also a beauty salon at some point in time.  It's perched on the edge of Mt Washington, and of course it has a beautiful view as previously mentioned. This place is tiny--the first floor has a small dining room that seats fewer than twenty, and the main dining room on the second floor seats about 25-30.  Both dining rooms have huge picture windows to admire the view, and if you're lucky you may be there during a Pirate's game--they have fireworks afterwards that you can admire from your table! The most amazing part was seeing the kitchen.  Seriously, it's smaller than my closet.  Two guys, working their asses off, tripping over each other constantly, and putting out food that looks and tastes as good as it does--that deserves a serious round of applause.    If you're looking to seriously WOW someone, particularly someone from out of town, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Fantastic views! Great food, great management but the servers are a little wonky. So take the good with the bad, enjoy some interesting Top Chef worthy food and take in some lovely views of the city. This place used to be a house and that is apparent since you really do feel as though you're dining in a home. Interestingly enough there are parts of it that don't feel as \"upscale\" as the quality of the food. The bathroom for instance is what you might expect in a small town diner and the \"host area\" when you first walk into this space appears as though you've walked in on someone in their den working on a home computer...kind of odd. Overall a nice dining experience, attentive staff and did I mention the lovely view?"}
{"text":"Sad experience.  Spent 60.00 sending flowers to a guest reservation, restaurant manager and general manager both told me they bungled it and were very sorry but NO they don't really care much about helping me get a refund on flowers they lost.  Can't say this was a good experience or a good way to resolve a problem on their end."}
{"text":"Maybe more like 3.5 stars. When I first entered the restaurant, I thought that I was in the wrong place. I saw a woman sitting at a computer and desk and talking on the phone, almost like an office. I did not find the entrance to be welcoming, and I suggest that the restaurant redesign that area. The woman got off the phone and took my husband and me upstairs so that we could be seated. We were put at a table right near the window so we had a good view of the city skyline. The waiter came by and gave us menus. The à la carte menu has the same items as the chef's tasting menu, and it added up to about the same price--$75 per person--for all items that I wanted (yes, I checked!). OK foods: gnocchi and the salad with garbanzo beans and ricotta cheese. Good foods: scallops, salmon, New York strip steak, and apple frangipane. Great foods: swordfish, venison, and lemon dessert. The waiter was nice and brought out our courses when we were ready."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I came here to celebrate our anniversary.  Since it was Light Up Night, aside from the amazing food and service, we were able to see two and a half amazing fireworks shows!   From the moment we entered, we knew we were in for a special treat.  We were early for our reservation, but to kill the time, the owner greeted us with complementary glasses of champagne.  Shortly after, we were escorted upstairs to our window view table.  The view of the downtown skyline was stunning. The only option for the evening was the $70, seven course prix fixe menu.  It was well worth the splurge.  Service was extremely attentive without being overbearing.  Our waiter provided a description of each course as it was brought over which provided very useful information considering we were eating dishes that we don't have on a regular basis.   The owner made the rounds several times, including one to take our photos and one to give us a printed copy in a folder that said Isabela's.  It was a nice touch and a great way to remember such a fantastic evening. I chose to get the wine pairings which provided a glass of wine with each course that I chose.  The pairings worked fantastically and the wines were very tasty.  However, four full glasses of wine was a bit much for one person, even with the spaced out dining.  If you chose the pairing option, you may want to share the wine with a dining companion. Since it was Light Up Night, we were able to see two amazing fireworks displays in addition to an amazing meal. The only thing that was even remotely a dislike was the fact that the tables are close together.  Not so much that you can't get in and out, but enough that you don't feel very private. Overall, an amazing experience with great food, amazing service and a stunning view.  I hope I will be able to return for some future special occasion!"}
{"text":"Very small restaurant on Mount Washington, looking down on Pittsburgh. One of the few in the row of restaurants in that group that is worth a night out. View is excellent and the food is imaginitive.   Fixed price menu.  Without wine, expect $50/person.  For this price, expect a meal to take several hours.  They will not rush you.  Nice personalized touches.  The chef often sends little things to taste. My vote for a place to take special out-of-town visitors.  http://www.isabelaongrandview.com/"}
{"text":"One of the best dinners I've ever had, and with a spectacular view. Great service, awesome food. I recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Isabela is a great place to take esteemed visitors and very special people. I have been there for many business dinners, and have always been happy with the food, wine, service, and the view. Especially the prix fixe menu is pricey, but it is well worth it for the right occasion (or if someone else pays for it)."}
{"text":"My Fiancee and I were out atop Mount Washington with sights set on getting a drink and seeing where the night took us. After a drink at a hole-in-the-wall place we thought we'd get back in the car and find a casual place to eat as neither of us was dressed uber fancy. We drove by a few places and came by isabela. From the outside it looks pretty low-key, wooden building with some great glass windows which we thought would be nice to eat overlooking the city. We went in and were seated right away - no reservation (i think we got lucky). We noticed we were a little under-dressed but we don't dress like slobs so it was fine. I got the menu and realized we were in for a treat tonight!   We each got the 7 -course prix-fix menu (which isn't cheap at $70) but we only go out 1 night a week so figured we were here so we figured we'd splurge. Food was amazing, and the service was right there with it. Each course had 2 or 3 offerings so we each got something different and shared everything. Everything was excellent. We also did the additional (i think it was $15) to get the wine pairing along with our courses. The pairings were spot-on which completed the experience.  Now we also lucked out - as we were finishing up with our 5th course we heard people talking about the time and eagerly looking out the window at the Pirates game. Apparently this was a fireworks night, and we stumbled on to the best seats in the house.   So the long in short of it, this is a great restaurant for a date night - even if it's impromptu like mine was. Romantic setting overlooking the city, great food, wine and service if you don't mind paying for it.   My only gripe was that they charge $6 I believe) for Valet parking. My bill with tax and tip came to $230, you would think for that amount they could at least pick-up the parking."}
{"text":"*Meh* If it were not for the amazingly hot date I was with, I would have rated this place lower.  My recent quickie trip to the Burgh meant that I intended that no matter what, I was going to see the Monongahela Incline, no matter what, and have to cram into that view a meal.  We took a rather fun (And cheap) ride up the incline, then in walking up and down the touristy, overpriced \"view\" restaurants on the upside, we settled on Isabela.  It was a bit later than usual PA dining hours, 8:30pm on a Wednesday night.  The place was pretty dead, only 1 other table.  + 1 Star - Menu.  They have an outrageously priced multi-course prix fixe meal, but they also have some alla carte items.  Well thank heavens for that. - 1 Star - Service.  Nice maitre'd (or maybe he was the manager...) who greeted us downstairs (a little shocked at first that we just strolled in off the street, but he covered his surprise well and made us feel welcome). The table side staff was weak.  Waitress forgot, in this order: water, bread, butter, our 1 side dish we ordered, 2nd glass of wine we ordered.  And there was only 1 other table of 4 people in addition to ours.  Additionally, though I understand that the place was rather shutting down toward the end of our meal (we left by 10pm), it is still not okay to not check on us and for us to have to put lots of effort into waving you down.  There is a reason you are paid as a SERVER.  To SERVE. - 1 Star - Quality.  I just was not impressed.  My salad was tiny - just ridiculously small, and the lettuce had some grit to it.  Wash my dang lettuce, folks.  The ravioli started (just ONE ravioli? Are you serious?) was homemade, granted, but the dough was thick around the filling, making it more like a pierogi and not a very good one at that.  Dessert was not memorable.  My espresso was cold.  Come on! Geez! - 1 Star - Price.  I know, paying for the view.  But it was just too expensive and too mediocre to warrant the price. +1 Star - View.  I kept looking out the window and longing to have that view forever.  Just gorgeous.  Definitely a night time spot, on a clear night preferably.  All in all, a place to go to once, maybe, for a romantic meal.  But just once.  Next time I think a picnic at the top of the incline would be better food though."}
{"text":"Came back here for our anniversary three years after our first visit. Food was just as amazing as we remembered it, but the room was much more lively. One large party and a few other couples. The meal takes a long time - there are many courses - but it's worth it to savor it. We went in the summer this time instead of winter and the menu reflected the season. Tasty greens and vegetables that I had never heard of made for a very unique meal but still very accessible. The wild mushrooms were mind blowing.   The owner came out near the end of the meal and took a picture of us and gave it to us with his card in a nice folder. My wife was pregnant at the time-- they had complimentary champagne for our anniversary but they kindly swapped it out for sparkling cider when they learned that she was DD.   I love this place. Expensive but the food is so memorable."}
{"text":"An absolutely amazing dinner!  We were lucky to get a reservation (due to a cancellation) on Valentine's Day.  We both had the prix fixe option, so that we could taste a little bit of everything!  Staff was fantastic, food was fantastic, and the view was amazing!  My favorite was the ricotta ravioli with truffles.  Delish!  I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"This was by far the best meal I've had. Everything was just perfect. My partner and I just celebrated our anniversary this evening by trying somewhere we hadn't been before. What and an absolute delight. We had the entire place to ourselves and the best table. We both opted for the seven course meal and honestly, each course was amazing. The staff was terribly friendly and went above and beyond to make this a very special evening. We plan on returning if the feeling of being so wonderfully full should ever pass. Again, I can't recommend this restaurant enough - please treat yourself."}
{"text":"Very private (only a few tables) and the food is just out of this world. Ordered a bottle of chianti which was a perfect fit for the roast beef.  Enjoyed it very much."}
{"text":"Isabella's is a diva well past her prime.    When you're driving up to a restaurant and there's a ten-foot-long banner on the side that says, \"Pittsburgh's Most Romantic Restaurant 2010,\" you know you're in trouble (nothing says romantic quite like a giant sign that says, \"Romantic\"). It's true the view of downtown PGH is sweeping, but the dining room felt like it was a set from the movie Network or American Psycho: time has not been kind to classy 80's interior design.  Okay, the service. When our waitress first came over she asked if we wanted to hear \"the restaurant's story.\" My dining companion had already been there and I honestly wasn't that interested. After saying we were good on the story she said, \"Well, let me tell you anyway.\"  And that she did; it was long-winded (the chefs cooked other places, they now cook here, etc.) and pretty boring. Throughout the rest of the meal we had to ask for water refills repeatedly and she didn't clear empty plates for ten minutes. However, she did manage to do a fancy fold on my companion's napkin the second he went to the bathroom. Whatever you do, don't let the napkin rest on the chair for even a moment! I don't know, it was like she took a Saturday morning high-end service class but got high right beforehand.  Whoever conceived the menu at Isabela's knew what they were doing, but whoever they entrusted to execute it doesn't. The prix fixe menu is 7 courses ($70 per person) and you definitely get your money's worth if you're measuring in quantity: both of us were stuffed by the end of the meal. But if you're measuring by quality of food I'd say no. The shrimp soup was just a failure (the base was waaaayyyy too tangy to make sense), the steak and potatoes were doable and the ricotta cheese cake had oddly squishy bits of almonds crunch in it. The squid and octopus entree was creamy and remarkably delicious.  If you find yourself here on a first date (as I did), or worse, if someone you've been with for any significant amount of time thinks you should spend your anniversary here, be sure to split a bottle of wine: it'll put a warm gloss on things."}
{"text":"My husband took me to Isabela's for my birthday a couple of weeks ago.  It was absolutely perfect.  Though, I would recommend getting reservations in advance.  We did the prix fixe menu and wine flight, which ran us a bit over $200.  I have to say that it was worth it.  The wait staff is amazing, the food was to die for, and the owner stopped by to take a photo of us.  But, the best part was the view.  It was incredible.  Even if you just stop in for dessert or an appetizer, you should definitely go just to see the amazing view."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, beautiful location, excellent service! One of the best dining experiences we've ever had!"}
{"text":"The view is of course the first thing you are drawn to. A thoroughly enjoyable experience. I opted for the seven course tasting menu and either chose perfectly or I could not go wrong! Either way, I was a very happy camper."}
{"text":"Great place with a great view of Pittsburgh at night.  We were one of the only people in the restaurant.  I got the 7 course meal, while my boyfriend got the steak.  Food was very good.   During the dessert round, my boyfriend proposed, so this place will always have a special place in my heart!  They brought us champagne to celebrate which was so sweet of them, and we enjoyed our romantic night together.    It's one of Pittsburgh's most romantic restaurants, that's for sure!  One side note: We always try to find ways to save some extra $ so we parked at the Duquesne Incline parking lot (for FREE!) and took the round trip tram up to the top of Mount Washington."}
{"text":"Great experience! The food was very tasty and the portions are not too small or big for a multiple course dinner. The best part was the meat course, absolutely delicious, and then the dessert. We got a sorbet as pallet cleanser between the fish and meat course which was very refreshing."}
{"text":"As a restaurant manager from San Francisco I can be very difficult to please. I actually looked for something to complain about and failed miserably.  I really wanted to dine somewhere with a view and this is it. It has breathtaking views of downtown Pittsburgh from every table. Our server was Carly. She was wonderful and answered all of my questions with confidence and in detail. My date and I decided to go with the Chef's tasting menu and were not disappointed. Every course melted in my mouth and each flavor profile was paired perfectly with another.. Little things I really appreciate like the clearing after each course, and explanation of dishes when they are dropped, refilling of water without asking... all added to the experience as a whole. To top off this amazing experience, George the owner came by to chat with us and take our photo. Owner/manager presence is so important and it also adds a VIP quality to the tasting adventure. I highly recommend this gem. What a refreshing, class act!"}
{"text":"Came here with reservations for 4 ppl; no wait at all, we were seated right away. View was great and service was superb. Very elegant and warm service, setup, decor. The outside is not impressive, but the inside is nice and simple.   It's always a prix fixe here where you choose a first course, a fish course, a main course, and a dessert; the chef chooses your amuse bouche, intermezzo and salad course.   We had: First Course: tuna sashimi with a pickled papaya, napa and grapefruit salad. AWESOME! The tuna was so fresh and delicate, and the salad was light and delicious. The papaya with the tuna was out of this world. My husband got the ricotta ravioli first course with morel mushrooms and said it was fantastic too.   Amuse Bouche: bleu cheese stuffed olive, fried, on a small bed of greens. Not bad.  Fish Course:  2 of us had the soft shell crab with peas, pea sprouts and avocado mousse. Not bad. 2 others had the halibut with golden yukon potatoes; very light and not bad. Neither of these was amazing though, but still they were good.   Intermezzo: Yuzu Anise sorbet - amazing!  Main Course: Leg of Lamb: mom said it was very good; it came with a piece of lamb liver though that seemed just ok. More that most of us don't enjoy liver all that much.  Ribeye with greens and parmesan potato galette: I typically don't enjoy ribeye, but it was aged very well and so tender - one of the best steaks i've ever had.   Dessert: Panna Cotta - not bad Chocolate Cake - OH MY WORD this was so indulgent and so wonderful. There was a long brick of chocolate cake, surrounded by peanut butter mousse, chocolate mousse, toasted fresh marshmallow, blackberries, and more pieces of dark and white chocolate. The dessert per person was so large, but every component was so delicious.   Coffee: really good here  I also had a glass of merlot that was fantastic, and dad had a glass of chardonnay; didn't ask if it was good or not though; seemed good.   All in all, this place rocks. Solid solid food, and the service is superb. The owner came by to say hello, and he took photos of each table and put it in a cardstock Isabela frame for you to take home. Seriously such good hospitality. Worth every penny. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Isabela is a small, non cluttered-but inviting upscale restaurant.  The Pittsburgh view from any table is fantastic and you also have the open view to the kitchen where the husband and wife team of chefs cook your meal.  What an added treat to enhance the dining experience with the smells of fresh cooking.  Yes it is pricey but well worth the experience!  Enjoy the seven course dining experience and add the wine coupling.  Even at $110 a person- it is wow, a tasting adventure.  I must say the use of local fresh foods and exquisite selections make this meal fantastic.  At each course the flavors are so invigorating.  Small portions but- to enjoy each step- the portions were right on.  The Kobe beef cheeks- heavenly!! Also George Merrick the new owner takes a real investment in your experience, welcoming every table and thanking them for coming.  He also offers a picture op- and prints it out, places it in a very nice Isabela picture holder and gives you a nice present to remember this outstanding dining adventure.  I cant wait to come back and try the seasonal menu changes.  A true testiment to the atmosphere was our waitress who has worked here for seven years.  What a great way to enjoy your birthday!! Thanks George for the champagne."}
{"text":"Went here for a graduation dinner. The food is grossly overpriced and the decor reminded me of a converted doctor's office or 90's sitcom. Not what you'd expect on mount Washington."}
{"text":"Basically the only thing this joint has is an amazing view.  The view of downtown PGH is stunning; however the building is old and cheap looking.  The dining room felt like it was a set from a bad '80s sitcom.    The service was solid.  Our server was friendly and knowledgeable.    Now to the bad - The food was average at best with small portions.  I ordered the steak and saw five small slices of steak, so I knew we would leave hungry.  Lastly, this place is so expensive."}
{"text":"Wonderful!!!! Absolutely terrific food, terrific service wonderful attention to everything. Owner even comes over to greet you and make sure everything is ok. Best restaurant in Pittsburgh and the views are pretty incredible!"}
{"text":"Fabulous location, fabulous service, delectable food, loved the wine selection, so enjoyed the atmosphere all with spectacular views!  No need to look around for parking, complimentary valet was also available.  Truly one of the best dining experiences in quite some time!"}
{"text":"Totally delightful experience, delectable food, warm friendly proprietor and staff and exceptional ambiance, especially being able to watch the sun set and night lights turn on in the city below this cliff hanging spot.  A real treat for this California visitor."}
{"text":"Now let me first state that I enjoyed the food, and it was overall a pleasant experience.  I made reservations for around 6 pm on a Saturday, and got a very nice table with an outstanding view of the Point in Pittsburgh on a clear night. My waiter was affable, and we had the tasting menu (as I recall, there was no other option) and we both got the wine pairing for $40 a person.  My problem with this place is that, whether you are 'gourmet' or not, if I am dishing out $300 for a 2 person meal, I really shouldn't leave hungry AT ALL.  The portions were very small for almost every dish that they brought out, and it is a very disappointing experience when you spend that much money and are still a bit hungry.  For that reason alone, I would not go back."}
{"text":"One of the best spots in the city. View is phenomenal and even caught Friday night fireworks.   Overall, food was fantastic (although we ordered a la carte).   Started with a cheese platter that was very mild with strong crackers - would not recommend.  But, then came the good stuff. Swordfish was steaky yet tender and not too fishy. The duck was some of the best I've ever had. Tasted the strip steak and that was cooked to perfection as well. Cheesecake for desert was perfect.  Wine was reasonably priced and the selection, while small, was diverse. Also, we were started with a complementary glass of champagne.   Came in assuming that we would be paying for the view with ok food. Was very pleasantly surprised that the food stole the show."}
