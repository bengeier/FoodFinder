{"text":"I checked out Zav Coffee Shop today. Beautiful place. They had classical music playing which was a nice change from the normal hip coffee shop. They have Sloan tea, which is a nice brand. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Had a delicious latte here. Also tried banana bread and brownie. Both were excellent flavours which relied on good ingredients versus tons of sugar. Very nicely decorated space. Cool jazz playing in the background. Attracts families, old people and young people.  At the back there is a comfy sofa and chairs if you don't want to sit at a table.  Colourful modern artwork which I assume is for sale.  Very clean and spacious bathrooms. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Happen to be around the woodbine/danforth intersection with 20 min to kill. Decided to look for a decent coffee shop and spotted this Zav coffee shop. Only ordered cup of coffee (one size, cash only). It has a small menu of coffee/espresso drinks and a few baked goodies (muffin, biscotti, etc).
I really liked their coffee. Quality is definitely there. But mild and smooth is better description (to me) so maybe next time I will try espresso based drinks and see.
The arts on the wall are nice and they do have warm, casual feel to the shop. Enough seating for a small coffee shop too. Nice staff and yes, I will be come back here again when I am around this area."}
{"text":"Fairly new coffee shop serving tasty coffee :) The concept and layout of the place was very nice. There was art on the walls, everything was brightly lit (but not overly so), and jazzy music was playing; similar to the atmosphere at art galleries (hence the name). Good amount of seating space, including a larger table that you could probably use for group work! 

I wish they had a longer menu - I think only the basic drinks were offered in the beverage list. It would also be nice if there was a food menu as well, since from what I could see there were just a few muffins on display at the counter, and I had no idea if there were other pastries or such for sale."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  It is my favourite coffee shop in the city and here's why:  It is airy and spacious - not crowded.  Welcoming.  With amazing music and the best coffee in Toronto (not an exaggeration) you can't ignore the need to take a break.  So pleased with the recent addition of large beverages, as I often take mine to go and find myself wanting more and having to settle for Starbucks.  Such a warm addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I live just around the corner, but I would venture to Broadview Espresso/Te Aro for my coffees (neither of them walking distance) until I saw this wonderful place open up and decided to give them a try. 

Down to earth and friendly owners, espresso-based drinks are all expertly crafted, banana bread is to die for, and the decor is very bright, airy and comfortable."}
{"text":"A new coffee was desperately needed in the area and Zav's does not disappoint. 

The space itself is very beautiful, to say the least. Polished cement floors, a mix of group and solo wood seating and some couches in the back. Wonderful art lines the walls and is available for purchase. They have music in the background, which is a bit loud for my taste, but likely to be enjoyed by most. I mean, I'd be pretty happy if someone over there read this and they decided to select a lower standard volume because I'm basically a crotchety old man. They also offer free WIFI.

I ordered an Americano and biscotti for a price of 4$, which is appropriately priced for the area, and both were delicious. Other items for tasting including cookies, brownies, and banana bread.

I'll be back.

{"text":"Had a great time at this gallery/ cafe. Coffee tasted fantastic, the owners were friendly and the art was beautiful. Deff reccomend."}
{"text":"Nice place with lot of seatings. Family and babies frinedly with very good coffee. Looks like a neighbourhood favourite.

Would be nice to see bigger selection of snacks and pastries, but mainly missing the option to pay with Credit cards.

Overall nice setting and very pleasant environment for working or cup of coffee with friends."}
{"text":"Well appointed, new spot on east end of Danforth. Owners have done a classy job in decor and service was positively artesian. Alas, coffee was ok but not great. For some reason, tasted slightly salty but may have been a chance occurrence. Owners have responded to my review professionally and I have updated accordingly. I will try their coffee again!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable! I really felt at home with the furnishing and carpets in the space, it's super cozy. This would have to be one of my top 10 study cafes in Toronto right now. So quaint and quiet, and the flat white was done perfectly - though a little bit smaller in size than most other places."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the place. Loved it from the moment i walked in. My coffee was made with such a precision, as a result it tasted as a great coffee should. Loved the atmosphere. The art,  the music. Amazing place to start your day in. I am guessing to finishbtour day there will be good to :)"}
{"text":"Great coffee in a lovely environment. They play classical music quietly so you can actually talk, and the couches at the back are awesome. Run by nice folks too."}
{"text":"Great espresso in an inviting space. The owner's baked goods are also very tasty. This has quickly become our go-to neighborhood coffee shop."}
{"text":"Wow. A gem on a somewhat bummy stretch of Danforth Ave.
I would give it a 4.5 if I could (only because I dont think any place is perfect so cant do 5/5 out of principal).
I hail from Downtown Toronto so take food seriously. 
This place has the 2nd best REAL brownie I have ever had to eat in Toronto. Honest. It is not overly sweet, and actually tastes chocolaty and is coated outside with cocoa powder which is a great touch.
Most cafes ship in their baked goods from wholesalers or catering departments of known bakeries. 
Zav made this from scratch, and I can tell because I tour Toronto cafes and bakeries and ALWAYS try their brownies. I literally have travelled all over the Metro Toronto area to try brownies. 
Never had one like this.
This brownie is as good as the best brownie overall in town: Delight Choclate's.
Great setting and clean place too. Not expensive too!"}
