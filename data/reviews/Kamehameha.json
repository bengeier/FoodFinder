{"text":"Excellent poke. L'endroit parfait pour le lunch si vous êtes dans le coin. 
Mention spéciale à leur crème glacée, au parfum et au look extravagants!"}
{"text":"Staff is very nice, in a great neighborhood, and is a unique offering as well.

What brought me here was the Ice Cream -  but also got some poke as well. They have a vegetarian version so it was nice to see that.

I'll start off with the poke -  it was made well, tasted ok, but it's basically ALL RICE. I got the largest size of a veggie option, and it was laughable how much rice the dish was made up of. Maybe, maybe, 6 spoon fulls of the non-rice ingredients on the top and the rest of the big bowl was all rice. I hate to be harsh with a review, but it's too offensive to not let it impact my review. My tip to the owners: don't be cheap, especially when your vegie option is the same price as the fish ones. Maybe you can put so little on a fish options IDK, but paying 15+ dollars for a few cubes of tofu with some vegies and a GIANT GIANT bowl of rice is nuts.

Next the ice cream -  it was good. They were having problems with their machine so I couldn't have the flavor I wanted. Had Cherry/Chocolate swirl on the fish. It was tasty, but very average too. More of an Instagram moment. The Ube was DELICIOUS, I tried a little of it from my co-diner who got it in a cup cause it was too soft for the fish cake.

I would try this place again perhaps, but I really hope they change their stance on how much rice they use in the poke."}
{"text":"This is an ice cream review! 

Came here for those insta worthy fish cones and was pleasantly surprised by a gorgeous restaurant. 

The ice creams are lovely creations where they fill a fish waffle cone with either custard or Nutella. Then you pick an ice cream flavour. I think they change them up but I went for a mango. They can swirl the two flavours they have as well. The toppings are minimal but very aesthetic. I got Pocky and an animal cookie. 

The price per cone is a bit pricey: $8+ dollars but it's nice that they have an interior where you can chill out for a bit. 

Overall a good experience. The staff are friendly and the restaurant is a photo lovers dream."}
{"text":"Delicious poke bowls! The red tuna poke was spot on. They have different sizes depending on your appetite. It's a really cute trendy decor Hawaii retro style with soft pink and jungle Colors. 

The famous fish ice cream is something you must try! Why? Well not so much for the ice-cream itself but for the waffle instagramable fish cone. Oh and sorry to spoil the surprise but you can add Nutella inside too.
You should have seen my eyes when I heard \"Nutella\"...mmm yes please!

So why 4 star and not 5? The price, $9 for the ice-cream and the small poke is a tad expensive too. Service could be a little more smiling too!
That's all you need to know!"}
{"text":"Commande passée avec ubereats, 2 grands poke (si on peut appeler ça grand). Un poke avec du thon avec 6 petits morceaux dedans, un poke végétarien composé à 90% de riz, aucun assaisonnement (a part les sauces très bonnes même si peu présentes) bref pour moi une grosse arnaque vu le prix. C'est vraiment dommage parce que les goûts sont bons. 
Dessert délicieux (tarte chocolat, noix de coco).
Je ne recommanderai pas."}
{"text":"The resto I still can't pronounce the name of but sounds like something something haha. I've been wanting to check out this place for a while. The location is not visible unless you use google maps - I had to squint to see the display sign on the window. Stepping in, the decor is no different than any other Poké place - but I liked the use of fresh green leafy plants. There were only three choices of ice cream  - matcha, coconut or peach or you could get half coconut / half Matcha. I went with the 1/2 n 1/2. The ice cream is  served in a fish waffle cone (under baked - the dough was a little raw) that is filled with a custard or Nutella base. I really enjoyed the presentation of the ice cream - decorated with coconut flakes, an Asian pixie stick Cookie and a mini fruit medley brochette of strawberry and blueberry. The flavour of the ice cream was ok - I enjoyed matcha more. All this cost 8.50$ paid cash or card. I paid with card- BE WARNED, I chose no tip on the machine because I picked up the ice  cream and was still charged 2$ tip- totalling 10.50$. I decided to let it go. 

Will I be back? Probably not. Kem Koba still holds my throne for sweet frozen goodness."}
{"text":"I'd been looking forward to this place since we decided to come to Montreal & it did not disappoint. Lovely gals walked us through the French menu to help us customize our bowls exactly as we wanted. Tried & loved the Waikiki & Haunauma. Topped it off with a lovely rose kombucha. If I lived here I'd eat here all. the. time."}
{"text":"Poke bowl was good but it was pretty much all rice. The fish they did serve us was good quality but I was disappointed that the bowl was 3/4ths rice."}
{"text":"Very very disappointing ice cream.

For 9$ a pop, you better knock me out of my socks. 

I had the twist chocolate-passion fruit. The flavours did not shine through. They felt water down. The passion fruit was a bit grainier and was melting faster. 

The service was slow and they only took cash. 

Yes, the fish are cute. But really, it only feels gimmicky. Sure you will have a cute Instagram. But that's pretty much it."}
{"text":"When I got inside the restaurant; I was mesmerized with so much pink in this restaurant. I loved the table sets; looks like the backyards tables and chairs of Olden Europe. Plus so many plants around. I believe; we want a Hawaiian vibe. I never been to Hawaii ...one day hopefully.

The service was amiable. 

I got hanauman bay poke ball. It was simply delicious with mix of salmon and tuna. My sister had sunset beach with salmon and
Mixed fruits, which my sister devoured it. 

Desert time: we went for ice cream in fish cone. I took coconut flavor and my sister took peach flavor. Beside, the fruits and the candies, the base of the ice cream was Nutella. I thought that was the best part of this item.

Definitely, our tummies were happy!"}
{"text":"For the price of 8.50 you get the smallest serving of soft serve in a pretty fish cone. Aesthetically pleasing, but in my opinion not worth it. The soft serve I had was mango and dark chocolate was good though. Maybe for a one time thing, but for the price doesn't make it easy to want to go back."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place to see what all of the fuss was about - and also for that insta-worthy pic! 

Ordered a fish-cone ice cream yesterday. The cone was warmed and filled with nutella (you can also get it filled with custard). I got the passionfruit & dark chocolate swirl ice cream. Came with a small skewer of fruits and a small skewer of candy.

The ice cream flavours didn't really mesh well together and I found them to be bland. The cone was the best part - I would eat that alone with nutella. I think that for $8.20, it's overpriced and they can do better."}
{"text":"Came here on a summer trip to Montreal. The poke was tasty and decor was nice. My friends had the ice cream with taiyaki cone which had nutella at the bottom (the flavors of the day were amaretto and lime, and you can ask for a mix)"}
{"text":"I must admit their fish cone softserve ice cream is very instagram-able, however it is quite expensive at around 8.50$ each. The cone itself was original but it's soft like a waffle, and considering that it was a really hot day, it was difficult to hold the ice cream up while it was quickly melting. Therefore, you have to eat it fast if you don't want it to collapse. Another thing I didn't like was that the cashier made our ice creams first before making us pay, which was not convenient at all since we had to pay with one hand while holding the ice cream. Overall, definitely a place to try once and take pics but for 8.50$, it wasn't what I expected."}
{"text":"The poke all was pricy but good, would not necessarily order it back. The mango ice cream on the other side was delicious and worth the price. It came in a fish filled with nutella and it was cute and original. A must try!"}
{"text":"Worst icecream and customer experience ever. When we asked what flavours there are, the cashier pointed a French handwritten menu and said \"there\" with no further explanation. How awful to expect and assume your customers know French? I have a French background, but assuming a customer just knows how to read French is just wrong. Awful, awful place. And to top it off, their icecream sucks. The \"citron et melon d'eau\" was the worse icecream tasted in my life. Even McDonald's is better and consistent."}
{"text":"Most millennial, Instagram-friendly place in Montreal. The Poke bowls are ok (don't come with too much fish, but delicious nonetheless), but what really makes Kamehameha worth it are the taiyaki desserts. For $9.50, you get a Japanese taiyaki, Nutella or cream, a twist of their amazing homemade ice cream (2 flavours, depends on the day), a Pocky stick and a stick of fruit."}
{"text":"The ice cream was really good (i got matcha/coconut twist), however, they just added the coconut mix so the coconut side of my ice cream melted really quickly, have I known, I would of took another flavour or only matcha (I think the cashier realized it after serving me because she told everyone else that the coconut was really soft...). 

The fish cone was pretty good but it was a bit doughty (the feeling when something isn't fully cooked but I guess it's good if that's what they were aiming for).

The inside of the restaurant was really pretty and clean. The toilets are also really nice!"}
{"text":"The fish ice cream looks really nice, the flavour was like how others rated, just average. It was more like sorbet than ice cream."}
{"text":"Wow this place is so cute and the poke bowls are delicious! Firstly, when going in, go straight to the back bar to order and then seat yourself. I ordered a large bowl of the hanauma bay which had salmon, red and white tuna with garnishes on top of rice. It was lightly sauced and the rice was perfect. Yum! Everyone in the restaurant had ordered the ice cream which was equally as cute sitting on top of a cone in the shape of a fish but I opted out so I can make myself go back there again soon."}
{"text":"too much hype.
cutesy.
nothing else to say. was not worth the cost of parking and the aggravation to get there."}
{"text":"Fish cone ice cream sucks! Tasted awful, cone was like a piece of rubber. It went straight in a garbage. Money waist!!"}
{"text":"Walked in and was slapped with a heat wave. No air circulation in that narrow enclosure. Service was extremely slow. Food was not something inaccessible. I had similar poké bowls at other places in town which provided me with a better all around experience. Ice cream was very average and the cone was overly chewy. There was nothing about this place that push me to recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Went to try out their softserve. Flavours available were Matcha and Cherry. I chose the cherry one and it was pretty good. Got the fish cone, it fits a lot of ice-cream and toppings, so it makes sense it's more expensive that your regular ice cream although $8.50 felt like an exaggeration?"}
{"text":"Went to this Hawaiian place because of so many amazing pictures that are posted on Instagram, their iconic ice-cream in a fish shell (aka taiyaki) is so popular! I have to admit that the soft serve in taiyaki is quite expensive (around 8.50$), but it was worth a try!

The location of this snack bar is in gay village, a buzzing and animated spot of Montreal. The interior decor of the place is tropical plant themed, with flowers and green plants everywhere. They also offer a variety of poke bowls, with all kinds of fish and the plating is simply amazing! Will get a try next time!"}
{"text":"Very friendly boutique looking shop, wish there was a sign in front so I could tell where it was. I ordered the taiyaki ice cream with passion fruit. The ice cream itself was fantastic but couldn't say the same for the taiyaki. Not sure if they sold us an old batch but it was too hard to chew on. The ice cream itself for that price  point was a bit pricey compared to what we can get  in Toronto.  Overall:

Store atmosphere: 4/5

Ice cream: 2/5

Overall rating: 3/5"}
{"text":"Ce nouvel endroit est tout à fait charmant! La formule: on commande au comptoir et on s'assied à une table, ou bien on partage la table de quelqu'un d'autre et on va se servir la sauce de son choix à partir du frigo. 

La vibe est très \"Wes Anderson\", les pokes sont frais et colorés, et il y a deux options végétaliennes sur le menu (un au tofu, l'autre au melon d'eau) c'est un peu cher pour ce que c'était (surtout quand on prend des options vegan, on s'attend à de plus gros bols), mais on a été rassasiés quand même et on reviendra probablement!"}
