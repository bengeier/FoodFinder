{"text":"Our retirees group has eaten lunch there twice and we think it is one of the best Mexican restaurants in this area.  Among us we had a variety of meals and all liked them."}
{"text":"Best Northern Mexican cuisine I've had outside of Ciudad Juárez.  It is NOT the typical mid-west-mex mush you get at other places in Ohio.   The enchiladas verdes and chimis are awesome.  I don't know who this \"Zoie C.\" is below (probably got turned down for a job there), but the margaritas were perfect.  It wasn't easy to find, but here is a link to their menu,  http://www.lamexicanacantinangrill.com/pdf/menu_lamex.pdf

There is not much atmosphere (the lights annoyingly flicker and it is more of a bar than restaurant) but I'm not taking away a star for that because I believe form follows function when it comes to this type of food."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and authentic. The owner is a total sweetheart. The servers are all friendly and attentive. The portions are large and you do not go away hungry at all."}
{"text":"Went here last night before the concert on the circle.  Excellent food, service was great, the the new owners visited with each of the diners.  A  excellent addition to the Tallmadge dining scene.  The fish tacos were the best, we have had in the area.  The dark sauce on the enchilada was a bit too spicy for me.  I will try the baked potato, which is there specialty dish.   margaritas were very good.  We will be back"}
{"text":"I have had better Mexican at Taco Bell. If I  wanted canned or frozen food I would have gone to the grocery and saved myself $$$ majorly. The Salsa was like canned tomatoes with dried cilantro and the margaritas were an electric green mix with the SMALLEST amount of alcohol possible for the price. The service matched the food in it was both inexperienced and oblivious to taste."}
{"text":"This is my Margarita  spot-- 1/2 price margaritas on Mondays and Thursdays, and they pack a punch. (If you are feeling adventurous, try a shot of the tequila from the beehive on the bar!)
The food here is delicious- my favorite is the sope, which I cannot find at any other Mexican location. The servers are all very attentive, and really try to meet our needs. If there is some way we want a burrito that is not on the menu, they make it for you. Great place for happy hour or family dinners!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. 4 of us ordered lunch from the To Go Menu. Portions were very small yet very costly for what we received. We were also missing a chimichanga. When speaking with the manager, she was not accommodating at all. She could care less that all 4 of us were unhappy...so if you are looking for getting what you pay for...look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night with six other friends to enjoy Margarita Monday. I asked for the \"half-priced margarita\" and was served one about 12 ounces in size. Prices weren't printed on the menu so had no idea what I was paying until the bill arrived. Turns out it came to $2.25, which in my estimate is a fantastic bargain, especially when I could actually taste the tequila (unlike some other places I had been to lately). So I had a second! They offer other sizes but I don't know if all are on special, so just ask for the \"half-price\" margarita on Mondays.

I ordered a beef enchilada and a beef chalupa, both of which I enjoyed. I usually avoid anything with ground beef in any restaurant because it's usually the cheapest grade of beef possible. Not here. I am happy to say I would gladly order the beef again (but will probably want to try the pork the next time I visit). Everyone at the table agreed their food was very good and they would gladly return, giving it at least 4 stars.

Yes, the service seemed slow at times and we sometimes had to flag down our waitress. But that's by Gringo standards. When south of the boarder, diners are usually left alone to enjoy their meal without being rushed. So, by Latino standards, service was fine. And I actually appreciated that the food was being made as we waited and not just pulled from a freezer and reheated."}
{"text":"Got the chapotle shrimp wow just wow. I guess its a family recipe from mexico. Well worth the try so good and I need a box."}
{"text":"More of a bar restaurant, than a restaurant with a bar... Food and service were ok. If your looking for a place to have nice date, this isn't it, if your looking for a place to hang out and have some drinks, this place is perfect..."}
{"text":"It all started when we walked in and had to wait to even get someone to come seat us. When we finally got a table we waited again for a waitress, after multiple people went back and fourth about our table being whose to serve. We then waited over an hour for our food.. I can honestly say I've never waited that long for Mexican food. We couldn't barely get any refills, no extra chips no extra salsa. Saw our waitress maybe twice? Service here is horrible, food average."}
{"text":"Amazing food and friendly staff! Love that it is family-owned and they take pride in their dishes. I challenge you to find something you will not like. Extensive appetizers, entrees, and desserts. I had the distinct pleasure of meeting the owner, who is from Monterrey, Mexico. When you talk about her restaurant, you can see the immense pride and joy it brings her to make people happy. She also remembers faces, adding to the ever-welcoming feeling. Their quesadillas are enormous and delicious. Their shrimp street tacos are also some of the best, if not THE best, I have ever had. They keep checking on you, drinks and all. Also, I brought my family of four, the waitress took the order (even with customizations), didn't write anything down, and it came out 100% perfect! Muy bien y fantastico!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Had the fajita burrito with steak and it was delicious. Will definitely be back. Service was good, chips and salsa were good"}
{"text":"Very consistent food and service. I am partial to the chili Pablano and chicken enchilada. My fiancé loves the taco salad. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Super family friendly and such a great staff!! My family comes in for taco Tuesday often. Custom cheese dips are excellent!"}
{"text":"Ate there yesterday with my son and his wife first time the food was horrible dried plane no taste we told our waitress about it she didn't even offer to replace our food our bill was $46 they offered us 10% off was not happy at all we didn't even eat all her food we showed our waitress.I message the management on Facebook you can tell they read it but they did not reply so we will never eat here again you were other good Mexican restaurants in Akron this place just lost the list"}
{"text":"Interestingly, I lived in Tallmadge for 2 years and never went here but as I was moving, finally went when I needed to refuel. La Mexicana is different from other Mexican restaurants, and I frequent them so I'd know. 

First of all, the menu is much larger and has more to choose from. The drink selection was better too. I about flipped when they had mojitos because I like those more than margs and most basic Mexican restaurants don't have them. I got one and my husband got a jumbo marg since we normally split a half pitcher (note: I didn't see a half pitcher option on the menu here, just full.) 

Next, we got queso which is a given. It came in a larger crock than normal and was priced a bit higher, but worth it I think. I then ordered fish tacos and wow. They were as authentic as seafood can get for the middle of Ohio. There were 3 and they were large, topped with a light cabbage slaw. They came with a cup of some fresh pico and a spicy orange cream sauce that was delicious. I want to say it was sour cream and some hot sauce, maybe some mayo? Who knows, but the perfect cool topping for the tacos. The Mexican rice that came with it was different too. It had corn and beans mixed in, which I loved. I took one taco and half of my rice to go and scarfed it the next day for lunch. 

Service was good and so was the atmosphere. It looks like they have live music a lot. Luckily I only moved a town away, I'll be back! There's a lot more I want to try on the menu that typical Mexican restaurants don't offer."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure eating at this restaurant made me sick. My husband and I dined here 4/14 and I started feeling sick while at the restaurant. He and I did have different menu items, which may explain why I became ill and he did not.  We also had NOTHING else to eat this day so there could be no other source. I would consider my stomach to be pretty iron clad able to tolerate a lot and I have no medical disorders which would cause me to be as sick as I have been all night after dining at this place. I know eating out is a risk for food born illnesses, but we have dined at many other establishments and neither of us have fallen ill. Eat at your own risk!"}
{"text":"Great food,awesome atmosphere.Daily specials with bar area Ohio lottery!!! Hey it's Taco Tuesday"}
{"text":"I have been here on multiple occasions, has turned into one of my favorite Mexican restaurants! All of those times were very good! It is a small little place so it can get noisy! Last time I was in my boyfriend and I found out they make their own tequila - the owner gave us a free shot for a sample it was DELICIOUS! The food is very good, love the chips and salsa and queso. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is, one of the times I have been there they had a band playing, there were so many speakers up and super load I could not hear my friend across the table from me. We actually had to text each other to have a conversation. I love this place just not on a band night!"}
{"text":"This place has delicious food and a festive atmosphere. There was a very talented live band too! The server was friendly and fast. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Went in on taco tuesdays.. got a pitcher of Margaritas, chrorizo queso dip, and a couple modelos.. Josephine and Hugo were awesome! Great local Mexican place it was PACKED even on a Tuesday. Muy bueno!"}
{"text":"Great food and decent service.  We did have to track down our waitstaff during the lunch hour, because they were very busy.  The owner (I think) was the one we tracked down and she was very nice and helpful and took our order.
I wish their menu would be a little more authentic, but they are catering to an Ohio crowd, and not a Mexican crowd."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of kind. No other Mexican restaurant can top! Best staff, service, and food. Menu is unique, staff makes you feel at home, and appreciated. I recommend to anyone looking for more than than regular experience. Best Mexican in Akron! Love it and I will return!!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight and it was awesome!!! Great service, great food, great atmosphere. Will be returning for sure!  They also have a raffle every month and all you need to do to enter is spend $20 on your visit and you're entered!"}
{"text":"I've been here at least 20-30 times, this is our preferred Mexican restaurant in this area. Always good, fast, fresh Mexican food and drinks. Great Servers, the Murphy Tacos are fantastic and the Margaritas never disappoint!"}
{"text":"Great product and pleasant staff. I've only been once but it was a pleasant experience all around. Service was super fast. We got our food in about eight minutes. It was slow for them but with service like that I'd be willing to bet that their top times are still under 20 minutes. This is one of the best 'Mexican' places I've been to in and around the Akron area."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch the other day. We were in and out quick.  Had the fish tacos.  It's really hard to find decent fish tacos around here.  There's were very good. Fish was cooked just right.  The came with fresh pico, and a really good cream sauce.  Not the best fish tacos  I've ever had, but really good."}
{"text":"This place is gross!  Has to swat gnats away during all my dinner. Then ordered a dessert, and it was served with someone else's beef pieces baked into it. I cannot recommend strongly enough the gross factor at this place, for what contanimated food you are served, and the gross contamination if gnats buzzing around your food and table."}
{"text":"Don't even deserve 1 star. Went for lunch the place was empty and the service was also like the other reviewer said \"nonexistent \". The basket of chips were all broke and when we asked for another basket the waitress just grabbed them off the table. Will not ever come here again Business must be good for them to be be able to lose customers"}
{"text":"Excellent authentic flavor! Enchiladas del mar with shrimp and scallops and chilé relleños!  Margaritas, fresh chips, guac, cheese sauce and a menu that just keeps going...will be back for more!!"}
{"text":"Love going here. Everything we've eaten here has been fantastic. The Monterey potato could easily feed 2 people and still have leftovers. No matter what you get, you will not leave hungry or disappointed.  I love their beans and rice. The servers are all friendly and accommodating, and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"This is a good not great option for Mexican food. I don't find it to be too terribly authentic when compared to other Mexican restaurants in the area - Don Patron in Hudson is 5-stars every time and service is consistently better. Service here is hit or miss depending on who is working, how busy they are, and well, mood of the staff that particular day. The owner has been here on the couple of times I've been in, but she has not interacted with me or my table. The food has been as hit or miss as service with the one time being pretty good to the other times being so-so at best. I've given it a few tries hoping for a different result, but at this point probably won't be back for a while.  On a positive note, the margaritas have been good each time. So maybe it's just good for a margarita and chips and salsa."}
{"text":"Yummy margaritas. Never had a bad meal here. They're not open late and often crowded."}
{"text":"The most DISGUSTING food I have EVER been served in a restaurant in my entire life! It was absolutely horrific what was on the plates and their prices are so high for the total dog food they serve you! This restaurant should just simply not exist.
I feel sick after being here. There were children constantly running in and out of the kitchen the entire time we were there....so unprofessional and totally unhygenic. I should have gone with my gut feeling and left when we saw this. Totally unacceptable in a dining setting.
The service too was terrible...had to get up from the table and walk over to the bar to ask for napkins and plates while our waitress just stood in the kitchen in full view talking to her co-workers, when a side plate eventually came it was covered in kitchen grease, just so gross! The staff were so loud too shouting at each other across the restaurant...i mean the whole experience was just so terrible. My stomach turned again when the bill arrived and we were charged EXTRA for tortillas...total robbery! I am so mad to have spent my hard earned money here. 
DO NOT EAT HERE! SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR SOMEWHERE ELSE!"}
{"text":"Tried their lunch since I work nearby. The staff was not really friendly but I could was ok with it if it meant good food. It's Mexican food for the Caucasian with a bland palette. Assuming this is what the area surrounding it prefers. Ground beef/ shredded chicken are their staples. Burrito was more of an enchilada since everything is covered with melted cheese. If you want salsa for your take out expect to pay extra too. 
The food was fine if you enjoy theses things. I will not go back. It didn't have anything special about it. Unfortunately i tend to feel this about most Mexican food in Akron. There's a huge opportunity to really offer good food, authentic and flavorful. Not something served from the kitchen steam table."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried La Mexicana last night.  The food was excellent.  Our server seemed to be new but did a good job.  We never had to ask for drink refills.  It took a little while for our food to come but it was worth it.

Wednesday's is 1/2 price appetizers, so we started with the Queso Chorizo dip.  It was amazing.  The waitress said they make the chorizo in house.

David had the Chimichanga's and I had the Burritos.  Both were excellent.  I loved the beans, but the rice was slightly bland.

Over all, we will definitely go back and we will choose this over El Campesino in Stow but not Casa Del Rio in Wadsworth (my favorite)"}
{"text":"We had actually chosen another Mexican restaurant in Akron to go to that was rated 4.5 stars on over 150 reviews. Our friend arrived before us and texted me while I was driving. She didn't like the area the other restaurant was in and suggested this place. So we went here instead. And of course since I was driving I couldn't look up reviews. BIG MISTAKE! I ordered the make your own combo with a chicken burrito, beef sope and beef tostada. Mind you the beef is ground, not shredded as the menu implies. My pregnant wife and our friend ordered the chicken burrito fajitas. And a side of fries for the kids. My plate of 3 items was incredibly bland. Our friend and I lived in Los Angeles for over 10 years, my wife for most of her life. So we have had authentic Mexican food. This is nearly flavorless gringo Mexican food. Those stating this is authentic in other reviews have obviously never eaten Mexican food west of the Mississippi. To the restaurant's credit, the burrito fajitas tasted good, but it was covered in cheese sauce, not actual shredded cheese. I've never seen authentic Mexican food covered with cheese sauce. I thought the burrito fajitas tasted better than all the items on my combo plate, so I was regretting ordering it and not sharing the HUGE burrito my wife had ordered. Well, later that night when my wife was feeling ill, my bland regrets were abated. I asked my friend this morning if she and her daughter had gotten sick. She said they tummy aches also. My 17 month old daughter had icky poo this morning as well, and all she ate were the French fries. So it seems the issue may be with poor sanitary practices or personal hygiene. On a trip to the bathroom I noticed a woman taking a young child into the back of the restaurant. Makes me wonder what sort of things the boy is allowed to touch or made to prepare. Not sure they understand that this is likely not acceptable by the local health department. So, in summation stay away unless you want bland, overpriced food poisoning."}
{"text":"Very  authentic, small, no wait ( 7 pm  Saturday) enjoying the golden pitcher. Very good guacamole and tacos."}
{"text":"This little gem has been mentioned to me a number of times but I didn't try it out until a few friends insisted we go after a hike in the metro parks. If that wasn't the best decision we've made this month, than I don't know what is.
The vibe when you walk in is relaxed and welcoming. The owners are always there and make sure you are well taken care of. The salsa and chips they put on the table are perfect. Not too spicy but not bland.
The food is absolutely incredible! Their fajitas are the best I've ever tasted but the true shining star is the Monterrey Chicken Baked Potato. This meal is more like 4-5 meals in and of itself. They put in probably 4 lbs of potato and add a cheese sauce, bacon, more cheese, mushrooms, onions, and chicken to a massive bowl with a large dollop of sour cream on top.
The waitress called this dish a 'boxer'... because everyone who orders it immediately asks for a box upon receiving it. Bonus: it tastes just as good warmed up later.
With the combination of the friendly vibe, themed decor, and incredible food, I plan on being a regular here for the foreseeable future!"}
{"text":"The food here is ok, but not great. Definitely a step up from Taco Bell... but there is better Mexican food in the area.

The food itself would probably be 2.5 stars, but the service was truly awful. We were greeted somewhat promptly, but then abandoned at our table. I would have said they maybe forgot about us, but there were servers walking around us all night. It took a few minutes before we got our chips and salsa, and that was indicative of the rest of the night.

We had to wait about 20 minutes before someone came to take our drink orders. Which the server got \"wrong\" in that drinks were forgotten. By the time we all got our drinks, we were ready to order, but while I was trying to indicate that, the server walked away. We sat for probably another 15 minutes before our food orders were taken.

The food took a while to get to us, but that part I was ok with, because I'd rather my food be made after I order it, than it being pre-made and just heated up to be brought to me. Our server forgot part of my order and I had to flag someone down to ask about it. It happens...

However, once we were done eating, it was as if we were invisible. Literally a full forty minutes after everyone in the party had *stopped eating* I finally went up to the front and asked for the check, and for boxes.

It still took about ten minutes, at which time a server came over and slammed two boxes in front of me and walked off. After about another ten minutes someone dropped off the check.

Five minutes after that, only then did someone come by and apologize for the delay ... bringing another copy of the check that we were already ready to pay for. (Obviously there was a lack of communication).

It was not an experience I care to repeat. Next time if I feel like Mexican, I'll go to Mariachi Locos  or Ranchero's Taqueria.

I will say the mojito I had was quite good. However, despite what it says on the menu it comes with a salt rim, not a sugar rim. Or at least, mine did."}
{"text":"I always look forward to good chips and guacamole and a burrito. 

Unfortunately everything was terrible. 

The guacamole was bland and the only flavor was a little too much salt. The queso dip was something I could have made better at home. Just not as good as any other Mexican place I have been to. 

I got the pick 3 sope, enchilada, and burrito all with beef. The beef tasted like it was from a can and over cooked. The rice was good. I mixed rice with the lettuce. All the other food I ordered was surprisingly bad. I'm not picky and I love Mexican food, but this was all terrible and I wasted $30... My wife liked the margaritas but that's all."}
{"text":"New parts of the menu rock! They ate changing maybe quarterly. That bumped it up to 5 starts."}
{"text":"The usual bartender always has a sour look on her face. They tell you their specials end at 9 o'clock every night but that is never posted anywhere. One time I went there, the bartender actually complained that she hasn't been making any money. Maybe if she had a better disposition, she would make more money. Their salsa is gross. The margaritas always taste weird to me. This place has a really nice bar, it's too bad it's being staffed by a sourpuss. It has a lot of potential, but I won't be going back again."}
