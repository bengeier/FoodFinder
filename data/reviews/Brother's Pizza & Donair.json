{"text":"This place is the best. Everything here is good including the service. Best bang for your buck if your looking for takeout in the area."}
{"text":"Brother's has always been an excellent place for a donair. It's worth my drive from the NE.   The sweet sauce is about as close as I can get to The Halifax Donair.  However, it is closed now due to the southwest Ctrain route construction. There is a sign on the door saying it is closed until the owners can find a new location.  I sure do hope they can relocate."}
{"text":"I went to Brothers from middle school until after I was finished high school and was very mad when my house and this shop got torn down for the new c train! IT IS EXCELLENT Edwin is back in business and ready for action !!! The food is just as delicious as I remember, and the service impeccable as always! I am now married with a child due yesterday and am proud to bring family and friends to this prestige establishment!   If you are ever looking for great food, excellent service, and a place that just can't be beat, you have met your match.  I read some of the recent reviews, Lindsays review seems harsh, she gave it such a low review because she couldn't order what was not on the menu, and for such a small establishment it is not like he would have a back up deep fryer just laying around, that is one thing I miss about the old location is the poutines which are unfortunately not on the menu anymore =( they were deeeeeeeeeeeeelicious!  and I come from the nw haha I practically speed there when I read they were back open! that sweet sauce is to dieeeeeeeeee for!  and @ Cory, rays was good, it is unfortunate he had to shut down, but I am x1000000000000 happier brothers is back!! all the food here is just to die for! I seriously hope you get to try everything on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Received two very undercooked pizzas and disgusting huge chicken wings with the tips on and practically zero sauce. I called to talk to them about it and was basically told they didn't care and wouldn't do anything to make me happy. Even after cooking the pizzas in my own oven they were disgusting. Terrible, terrible food and service. I'll never order from here again."}
{"text":"Don't go here unless everything else is closed. Pretty rough food. Dirty like the rest of the area."}
{"text":"Wow. This is the best Donair pizza in Calgary. I also love the salt and pepper chicken wings."}
{"text":"My family gets take out from here a lot because we essentially live across the street and we hate to cook. We've tried a variety of the specialty pizzas, shawarma, falafel, salads, and pastas and we've enjoyed them all. They also have good baklava. The pick up time is always super quick and the food is delicious and affordable. I particularly like the falafel because it is huge and inexpensive."}
{"text":"Oh Brother's, where art thou? ...In the SW! 3967 17 Ave SW, to be exact!   Full disclosure - we wound up checking out Brothers because Viet Sub Express was closed. http://www.yelp.ca/biz/viet-sub-express-calgary Did I like what we found? Yah, I'd say I did.  The place is cleaner than your average donair shop, with brightly coloured walls. It's still not the kind of place you'd go to for the funky ambiance - you grab a donair to go, or sit at one of the tables for a few minutes while you shove it in your face - but it was still nice that there was a bit of effort.   Along with the usual selection of canned soft drinks in the sliding glass door cooler for you to help yourself to, they have Cherry Dr. Pepper! What a delicious find this was! Short of the more boutique candy stores around town, I didn't know you could get this anywhere.  My beef donair had a good amount of thick cut meat strips and was surrounded by the usual watery, bland shredded letuce and other donair topping. I wasn't stopped in my tracks by this thing by any means but it still stomped the late night hunger pangs into submission.   If you're looking to conquer every donair stop in the city, definitely give Brother's a try. It'll satisfy you when you're hungry but I still doubt it will be making your \"Best Donair\" list."}
{"text":"Gross.   That's it.  This chicken shawarma was bad.  Tasted like he cooked the chicken in a saucepan and dumped bad seasoning on it.   The tahina was not flavourful.  The garlic tasted like Ceasar dressing.   No sweet sauce at all.    The only thing this place has going for it is that it's clean and bright."}
{"text":"I was craving a donair (being from the east coast this is not a rare occurence). My normal places that I get donair from were either too far away or closed (9pm at night). I go to Brother's donair. I order a donair with sweet sauce with no veg. I get my donair about 5 mins later (which surprised me that it was that quick) and I drive home. I sit down getting ready to dive in when I open it up and I kid you not. On top of this huge pita bread is a measly 4 pieces of donair meat. WTF.   They sell this as a \"jumbo\" donair for $7.50. This is insane to me! I of course didn't pack it up and drive back up there cause 1. I really don't have the time and didn't feel like it as I had just got off work from my second job and 2. It's not really who I am.   I am a live and learn type person and I have learned to NOT get a donair from Brother's EVER again!"}
{"text":"Let's get this out of the way first off - I'm a chubby dude. As such, I trust my belly over any \"foodies\" out there who talk about ambience or other foofy foo nonsense that has nothing to do with good food. I was a fan of Famous Ray's Pizza on 17th Ave so it was a bit of a surprise to see it had been replaced by Brothers (which I remember being located across the street before C-Train expansion came along but had never tried). It was late and I figured I'd give these \"new\" guys a try.   First off, they may sell donairs, but make no doubt about it pizza is their primary offering. After checking out the menu, I was pretty impressed with the selection of specialty pizzas. To be honest, so many of them sounded so good that I had no clue what I wanted. It was at this time that a group of 3 people came. With how friendly Edwin (the owner) greeted them you'd think they were family. They ordered these things called \"pizza rolls\". I didn't even see them on the menu so I thought maybe this was a  \"regulars\" order. After re-checking the menu, I finally found them - nestled inconspicuously on the back page with no real description. Basically, they're donairs but instead of typical donair toppings you get to choose any 3 pizza toppings. I'm always down for trying something new so I got Edwin to throw together one with chicken, pineapple, spinach and sweet donair sauce. Holy crap on a cracker it was awesome, and for only $3.99, I think I may have found something to replace my Thai addiction.  I'm already trying to figure out what type of pizza roll I'm having next time. That's a pretty good sign that this place has something good going on. A high 5 recommendation to anyone."}
{"text":"Sorry, my Brother's, but I don't find anything too spectacular about your store.  I went in hoping to have a coffee and maybe a small donair, since I wasn't terribly hungry, but wasn't able to have my needs met.  They didn't sell coffee, which is fine, but they also weren't serving small donairs.  The best I could get was a large one for $9.  I definitely wasn't hungry enough to eat a large, and I certainly didn't want to pay $9 for it.  I decided that my donair needs would have to wait until another and that I'd have poutine instead.  What?!  They can't make the poutine because their deep-fryer is broken.  Okay, what about a small falafel?  No!  They are only serving large beef and chicken donairs today?  Well, that seems awfully strange.  Since I couldn't justify buying something I knew I couldn't eat, I settled on a box of orange juice and I got the hell out of there.  Luckily, the orange juice was only $0.85!  Hey everyone, head to Brother's to buy boxes of orange juice!  Nah, not worth it."}
