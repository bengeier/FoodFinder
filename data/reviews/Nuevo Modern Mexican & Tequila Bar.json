{"text":"If Barrio is to Chipotle and Momocho is to Qdoba, then Nuevo is to Moe's. As such, the food is poorer yet more expensive than its competitors. Or worse, the quesadilla reminded me of Taco Bell's crunchwrap supreme that I've had in the past, which isn't the Ratatouille-like nostalgic experience I'm looking for. The open kitchen in front of the tables kind of brings about a fast food vibe in itself. Moreover, it's a bit loud and hectic inside. 

The tacos with the pineapple slaw were slightly better, but el pollo isn't anything special. Furthermore, the (black) beans and rice, especially, were cold. 

Otherwise, the waiters are friendly. Although the germaphobe inside me screeched as they grabbed our water cups by the rim of the glass, and didn't provide straws unless one asked for the unwrapped straws that they, being nice, touched and put inside the drinks themselves. 

Nonetheless, it's certainly a good spot for drinks and some beach volleyball on the pier. There are plenty of tables out front along with a second-floor patio where one can take in a stunning view of downtown Cleveland. Additionally, the impressive design of the building pulls one in to make a stop."}
{"text":"Two** I had Arrived around 11 o'clock they were open till 12. So me and my teenager kids could not wait to try out this restaurant and hang out. Was not what I expected,  I had a margarita it was water down very high-priced, Tasting the way it did. It's took about 15 minutes to get my drink finally ordered my food when my food had came. The food was cold was not what I expected Mexican food should taste like. One thing I have to say the server (Rivera) was very nice he was excellent and made up for everything else. Hopefully they work on their production."}
{"text":"Way over priced. Maybe this place is just too fancy for me but I feel like you are paying for presentation. The food was good, but for $30 for my meal, I don't expect to leave hungry. Will probably not come back."}
{"text":"Venue is beautiful, Not at all impressed with the food. Guacamole looks like baby food. Kitchen was painfully slow.  Menus barely legible, our server was able to obtain the original for us to read. Spice up the food before the place sinks!"}
{"text":"The service was just ok. It was Labor Day weekend so they were busy. The atmosphere would of been nice but our table directly faced the kitchen, so not much of a view. The server was really busy and couldn't really go over the menu, so being that it was our first time here we didn't really know what to order. Also the drink menu was limited. We weren't able to order certain drinks off the menu because the server stated the bar was so busy they were not making certain drinks, which was a bummer as I definitely wanted to try one of the margarita flights. They also ran out of black beans! I don't think a Mexican restaurant should ever run out of black beans, like seriously! Overall for two people plus tip we spent $130, with no black beans, limited alcohol selection, a view of the kitchen, and mediocre service. I will give it another shoot on a less busy weekend or weekday, and I'll definitely be sure to ask for a better table. Otherwise based off my first visit it was just OK."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see how varied some of the reviews are. The service that we had on a moderately busy Friday night was great. It is an incredible new space with great views of Downtown, especially the Rock Hall and North Coast Harbor. My favorite things about Nuevo are the drink list and the space. If you are interested in trying some tequilas that you wouldn't be able to find in many other places, this is the place to do it. All of the bartenders were knowledge and willing to share their knowledge. The upstairs is worth taking a look also, and has really good views of the Factory of Sadness too."}
{"text":"I gave it a second try and both times they provided terrible service from the hostess to the food service. 
I'm still not sure why reservations are needed in order to be seated indoors for lunch service, particularly when most of the tables were not taken. 
We sat at the bar for 2.5 hours and when I left the tables were still not taken. 
Food is average. I do not recommend spending the money. Barrio is a much better choice."}
{"text":"This place was great for happy hour specials . 6.00 margaritas. Different kinds of flavors. 2.00 off beer. Cheap appetizer. 
So we sat down to eat. I ordered the beef braised tongue taco. It was ok. Has no flavor to it. I just put some house made hot sauce on it."}
{"text":"I have never written a yelp review and don't intend to write another. My intention is to warn others away from a place that is far below expectations and price point.

The host stand did not call to notify us that our table was ready. We only discovered this because we asked after people who arrived well after us were seated. Nuevo's initial solution was to try to cram us into a table too small for our group. We had to ask for a table that fit everyone comfortably. 

As other reviews state, salinity is a major issue. Almost every dish was bland and under seasoned. 

Margaritas were refreshing but also seemed to be devoid of tequila. 

Guac sampler was the same house guac for all 3, but 2 of them featured a slight sprinkling of other toppings. Not enough differentiation to justify the mark up. 

The mashed potatoes in the Carne Asada tasted cloyingly sweet as if seasoned mistakenly with sugar instead of salt. Very strange. 

The al pastor mahi was over cooked, smelled very fishy, and tasted off. The claim of \"modern\" does not excuse a preparation bearing nothing in common with its namesake. 

Both bean options were bland and strangely seasoned. Texture suggested that they were canned. 

I have never complained to a server before but we felt compelled to talk to our server about our issues. I got the impression that this may be a common occurrence.

Despite kindly taking a few items off of our bill I still left feeling like we drastically over spent for what was provided. 

I fear for the future of this restaurant and its staff. I will not be back and recommend that those considering a meal here look elsewhere."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Nuevo in Akron very much so I had high expectations for this location. Unfortunately, the overall experience was a disappointment.

My wife and I decided to try the Restaurant Week Special which included a short rib appetizer, the snapper entrée, a pork entrée, and some basic desert options.

The appetizers were good and so were the margarita flights but both main courses were really bad.  The fish was very bland and the pork was tough and chewy. Neither my wife nor I ate much of our meal.

The service was good and I liked the layout of the place but the main dish should be the highlight of any restaurant visit.

I will give this location another chance mainly because  of how much we enjoy the Akron location."}
{"text":"$35 to park just to eat during a Browns preseason game, obviously I didn't eat there and won't try to again. Way to work it out Nuevo."}
{"text":"Nuevo is supposed to be known for Mexican cuisine  and margaritas. We decided to get a round of margaritas and were told they are too busy to make them, took a good 10 minutes to get through to them that I would just like an alcoholic drink. God forbid you ask for a lager beer, it's like asking for a taco on a silver platter. For a restaurant being open 6 weeks and the roar on the shore crowd this weekend I was very dissatisfied with the service and would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd time having lunch at Nuevo. First time was right after opening and service was tremendously slow. I figured this was just new restaurant kinks that needed to be ironed out. Apparently not. 

This time we had a party of 7. After about 20-30 min of ordering food, three of us got incorrect orders. I ordered a bistec burrito but received a pork or possibly chicken burrito. I was pretty sure that it wasn't what I ordered but no one seemed to know for sure what was sent out. Few minutes later, 2 more orders came out. But the final 1 order took even longer and didn't come out until everyone else had completely finished eating. We had to have it packed up so that we could leave since we had been there well over an hour. 

I know how hectic restaurants can get, but what was inexcusable was the lack of real concern to correct them. Instead of checking in on our last order, it felt like the staff was intentionally avoiding us. 

And when we finally got the check, nothing was comped or discounted even though 3 orders were incorrect and 1 of those had to be boxed up. Also I was hit in the head with a plate since the staff was so hurried and confused. They lost 7 customers since none of us will be returning again."}
{"text":"Outstanding location downtown on the Lake! Atomsphere is very busy. Margarita ' s are definitely their thing. Many different flavors. I had the jalapeño cilantro & their signature Don Julio Marg. Both delicious. They have a flight of tequila that looks fun and many other fresh ingredient drinks to choose from. With the many different drinks to make the bartenders are VERY busy in fact they got swamped with drink tickets. Despite the chaos they all maintained their composure & got thru the rush. The food is just okay. Did the trio of salsa the Verde was very bland.  Other 2 were tasty. Tried two entrees the shrimp tacos, nothing special wouldn't get again. Also.tried the beef brisket, the meat was a bit salty but very tender. All in all a great place to drink & take in the beautiful downtown & lake views! Will hold off on food."}
{"text":"Not. Real. Good. After my lunch companion picked me up off the floor, I took another look at the bill...and promptly fainted again. $40 is/was/will forever be outrageous for a lackluster Mexican lunch. Got the Carne Asada with the the standard sides (rice and black beans) and the pico and \"guacamole\" (two slices of bland avocado). It was okay at best. Portion sizes are minuscule, but that was okay with me after tasting the rice. We were treated the the sounds of the turbo powered hand dryer in the bathroom, and the servers using the door seemingly in the middle of our table to serve the outdoor guests. Having the bus pan set on our table to clear the plates was a nice touch too. 

It's new, and can learn. I'm rooting for them, but I'll definitely wait awhile before revisiting."}
{"text":"I am in town for a conference and enjoy trying new places, as Nuevo Modern was near our hotel, my colleagues and I decided to give it a try. The place is very modern with a cool view of the city, and since we were seated near the bar, the bartender did double duty as waiter. The guacamole & shrimp appetizers we started out with were great, very tasty. The service was excellent throughout the meal. They ran behind with our main meals due to a large party also dining at the same time. We did not see it as an issue as we were enjoying the experience . Regardless the manager came over and apologized for the delay and comped our meals. This was not necessary. We were very impressed with with her customer service & the care the staff gave us. The main dishes were also very good (enjoyed the shrimp tacos) 
My colleges and I had a great experience & highly recommend  Nuevo Modern!!"}
{"text":"They have a great atmosphere!  The views from both inside and out are great!  The drinks were tasty and refreshing!  The guacamole flight (we had cucumber/mint, habanero jelly, and corn) were are delicious!  (My favorite was the habanero jelly!)  I also had some shrimp Ceviche which was amazing.  The entrée portions are average in size, but definitely filling!  A return trip is definitely in the future!  Make sure to make a reservation as the wait times can be quite long!  The $$ should actually be more $$$ though..."}
{"text":"Had dinner here August 20, 16 around 5pm.  Seeing the gourmet menu online I was so excited to try.  The restaurant is gorgeous and in a perfect location. We had a 45 minute wait which was ok as we sat at the bar and had a couple of drinks.  I commend this restaurant on their high level of customer service and tasty drinks.  Our dinners consisted of tacos al pastor (Mahi) steak quesadilla, house guacamole, salsa trio, and pollo crema.  Unfortunately the food was very lacking.  The house guacamole lacked basic ingredients.  The rice and beans were bland.  I think the menu is very creative but needs better execution."}
{"text":"This is a really great place. Came here about a month ago in June with my wife and dog. Beautiful weather made for a nice patio experience on the lakefront. Next door to Burke Lakefront airport so it was cool watching someone flying a Cessna around in the pattern practicing touch and go's. Our server, Kristen, was a very beautiful, sweet young woman who picked up on me being vegan even though I didn't specifically state so and recommended items on the menu that would be acceptable for me. Talked for a few minutes after our meal while she pet the dog.  I will be back."}
{"text":"We visited this Mexican restaurant after exploring the hall of fame. It has a lot of seating available and we got a table outside by the water. 
We had their lemonade and it was very good, the cocktail list looked very inviting! 
We just wanted to order snacks/apps but their menu looked really tasty.
Our server recommended the calamari and shrimp. I definitely liked the calamari better. Nicely coated, tender and a lot of flavours! 
The shrimp were alright, not crazy about the tequila sauce they were in. It would have been nice if they brought some bread to soak up all the sauces! 
Staff were really nice!!"}
{"text":"How can you be a high end Mexican restaurant and not offer complimentary chips and salsa or homemade guacamole? Guacamole tasted like it was from a pre made supermarket container. Saving grace was the margarita flight. Very disappointed as a whole."}
{"text":"The star of the show was the cheese dip. All other food including the papa Fritos was over seasoned and somewhat bland since all the food was heavily seasoned. The chicken tacos was something out of a slow cooker and too juicy and sweet with spices . Tourist trap."}
{"text":"AMAZING house margaritas.
We stopped here while we were playing pokemon art voinovich park and the science center (we could reach a stop from the restaurant. 
We're from Texas and have generally not been thrilled with Mexican food in Ohio, but two things here were fantastic: margaritas and polenta. Some of the best I've ever had. The rest of our food was pretty good, but nothing to store home about."}
{"text":"The only good thing was the waitress was very nice and good server. We had the queso with chorizo, it was horrible and I am being kind. The Diet Coke was good so that's worth one star"}
{"text":"We had lunch at this restaurant after visiting Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  The restaurant is located in the nice spot overlooking the water.    Their staff was very accommodating (we needed a table for 7) and found us a table outside in a few minutes.   Our waiter was pleasant, he  highly recommended to try their specials. We ordered several dishes from the regular menu and chicken n biscuits from their specials menu.  Overall, the food was average.  I had the jerked shrimp taco and it had no spice at all.  As a matter of fact, i would call this dish coconut curry or thai shrimp though it was pretty bland.  Chicken came severely undercooked (raw inside) and we had to send it back to the kitchen.  Again, the staff was gracious enough not to charge us for chicken.   We are not from Cleveland but if we come back to visit the museum again we will definitely look for a different place for lunch."}
{"text":"Raised prices for pride weekend.  Food was bland  -needed salt for everything.  $6 guac was only maybe 3 oz."}
{"text":"Registered on Yelp just to leave this review. The service was very slow despite about twenty of waiting staff running around. Waiting about an hour for my shrimp tacos if you can call it tacos. The shrimp was in one bowl and tortillas in another and I had to assemble them myself. The food was just tasteless. Plantain fritters were just burned. Basically waisted $30"}
{"text":"After visiting the nearby Rock and Roll Hall of Fame my husband and I came here for dinner. It was a busy time with a 30 to 40 minute wait for a table so we had our meal at the bar. 

My husband ordered the shrimp taco with Mexican rice and black beans. It was served with wheat tortillas. When he muttered to me, \"I forgot to ask for corn tortillas\", the bar tender heard him and said, \"I can get those for you, sir.\", and did so immediately. 

I ordered from the appetizer menu - Camarones and papa frita (potato wedges seasoned and baked). The large shrimp were perfectly cooked in a garlic and vegetable sauce. 

DRINKS. I had a cider available on tap. Can't remember the name but it had a very light flavor which went perfectly with the food. My husband, who can be very picky about margaritas said the house drink was quite good. 

All in all we were very pleased with the food and the friendly service. 

FYI About the parking. We used the high priced municipal Pier 9 parking lot which was fine since we were in the area for several hours, however it's way too expensive for anyone just visiting the restaurant. We were told that there are a few free spaces for customers behind Nuevo."}
{"text":"The margs are fantastic! Our server made excellent recommendations on them, as well as unusual salt choices for the rims- we were pleasantly surprised! I chose a classic marg with a Smokey salt rim. We also shared the Queso Fundido app..... will not disappoint! Slightly pricey drinks and apps only, but the atmosphere and views make up for it. Will be coming back when in CLE!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, creative menu and very friendly staff! I took my girlfriend here for our date night and had an extremely pleasant evening. The bisonte was to die for! And the view is incredible. Drinks were reasonably priced. Would definitely recomend for a special ocasion or just a night on the town."}
{"text":"Location: 5 stars
Building: 5 stars
Ambience: 5 stars
Cocktails and drinks: 4 stars
Service: 5 stars. Carmen was fantastic for us. 
Food: 3 stars. I'll specifically mention the ceviche. I kid you not the ceviche manages to taste like Fruity Pebbles cereal. 

Let's hope this restaurant succeeds. The location and decor are fantastic. I'm a little surprised to see so many people hanging out at he bar instead of sitting out on the patio."}
{"text":"I liked the habanero jelly guac much more than I was expecting too, and the sauce that came with the \"percha\" dish too.  Service was fine.  I think it's great that another place is taking advantage of the waterfont.  Biggest drawback here are the prices.  One app, one drink, and one entree, and my bill was over $65.  While I enjoyed my food and the atmosphere, it just didn't seem like the kind of experience that should cost that much. The margarita selection is above average, but the execution is just ok.  They should visit Johnny Mango's to see how a cilantro jalapeno margarita should be done."}
{"text":"The views!!! Beautiful patio and views for everyone in the dining room. 
We didn't have a reservation. But it was two of us on a Monday. We walked right in and we're seated at a cozy booth for two! Perfect for us! 
If you like a well made cocktail... this place is for you! We had four different margaritas and each one was delicious. Still unsure about all the fancy salts and seasoning you can get. But ask your server for advise. 
We were super lucky to get a wonderful server Christian. He gave us a true dining experience and indulged my fiancés questions about everything booze. 
We had the calamari to start, it was good nothing great. We each had tacos. They were ok. 
Honestly I miss chips! I like them on the table. I don't want to have to order them. But to each is own. 
Food is pricey and nothing truly special to get me up be a regular. But the views are great! And there is a CLEVELAND sign to takes pics with! 
Much love!"}
{"text":"Ok, we ate here due to the proximity to rock n roll hall of fame, we called ahead for seating. Glad we did as there were two large parties with reservations on the second level where we were seated. Only one other party of two and us seated on the second level with the other large parties present. I ordered the margarita flights, consisting of the house, spicy mango, & guava. The best was the spicy mango with a lime salt rim. Second favorite was the guava, the house margarita was a disappointment, it tasted like watered down lime juice. If I return I will order the spicy mango margarita, delish! We also ordered the trio guacamoles to try. Ok here's where they could really improve, all three were the basic guac, nothing on it (bland), corn on top, (ok but not worth the extra buck), or hot pepper jelly poured on top. That one was actually good, so if you have a mediocre guac pour some hot pepper jelly on top to spice it up, it was good. My companion ordered the arugula salad with chicken, it was just ordinary not worth the trip for that. My entree was the pork taco, instead of the sides I switched to the specialty sides of polenta and the corn bread, wow, the corn bread was fantastic, the polenta was good but not my favorite. My pork tacos, were construction style served with soft flour tortillas, so you add the meat mix and fold. Of course I added the hot pepper jelly guacamole to the mix to spicy it up! I really liked the pork tacos on the taqueria side of menu at the bottom of the list. Try these folks, you won't be disappointed and be sure to upgrade your sides, my recommendation is the corn bread!"}
{"text":"Food is good, especially for Mexican food in Ohio (I'm from SoCal, so I'm judgy when it comes to Mexican food!). Everything was fresh and this is definitely not the typical burritos and enchilada drowning in sauce you get around here. I had the queso fundido and chips (chips were not hot, boo). Queso was very good. And then the delicious tacos al pastore with grouper. Very good with a touch of pineapple. Margaritas were nice and strong too. Where this place could do better is service... while friendly, it was disorganized. My queso went to another table and there seemed to be an expectation that I would eat it after it sat on the other table for 15 minutes. Sorry, I didn't want it after others might have been in the chips and it was more than likely cold. Then, the guacamole and chips someone else in the party ordered, didn't come out, but was put on my bill. Then they couldn't get it off my bill and it just became this drawn out thing. While everything worked out ok, it just was a struggle tonight. But very enjoyable atmosphere and good food!"}
{"text":"Best margaritas I've ever had. Everywhere else use sour mix from a gun. These guys actually HAND SQUEEZE their margarita mix. And the bartenders know a thing or two about tequila. Blown away by their knowledge. Guac was superb. Salsas are awesome. And my hanger steak was prepared perfectly! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Loved this place, really enjoyed the atmosphere and the service! Black cherry margarita was a hit the beet vodka drink was really original and I enjoyed! Our waiter was Eric he was great gave us some good insight on the city, took his time to talk to us. Our food was great we ate during lunch but I'd recommend the habanero jelly guacamole for a appetizer!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I decided to stop and and eat lunch before we toured the facility as a possible wedding venue. We had mentioned out tour to the hostess in the event our meal ran over the hour we had before our meeting. 

We had plenty of time to look over the menu as it took some time for our waitress to come over. When she finally made her way over she was a little over enthusiastic but we placed our orders. My fiance had the Cuban with papas fritas and I the arepas and spoonbread. The spoon bread side dish came out first and a pretty tasty. My fiance's cuban was good but a little bit of overkill when it came to the mustard.  When my arepas came out i was a bit confused as they look nothing like a traditional arepa. They were beautifully plated and fairly tasty. I was about 3/4 of the way through my meal when I found a hair. I got the waitresses attention and told her I was finished and that there was a hair in my dish. Seconds later she was back to inform me it was removed from my bill and she was very sorry. Not far behind her I assume was a manager who also apologized as well and then made a joke about how her hair wasn't pulled back as she was clearly serving food. They had a great response to a unfortunate situation but I still just wasn't impressed overall.

I think that this place has potential based on their location. Being next to Voinovich Park allows for a beautiful view of the Cleveland skyline but also brings with it parking problems. Your options are meter, valet or pay to park and spaces are limited."}
{"text":"Great addition to downtown Cleveland! The location of the restaurant is priceless.. Had dinner on opening night & food is great. Had the Calamari as an app and was served promptly & trout for dinner when finally my server forgot about me. Had to ask hostess for my server... It's opening night and staff is a bit overwhelmed so be paaaaatient.. The hostess bought me a margarita after 45 minutes of waiting time to place my dinner order.. I def be back & hopefully staff will be better trained and organized!"}
{"text":"Food was bland! Service was non existent! It's so bad I am sitting at the table in the restaurant doing this review. It started when we came in and we're sat with the lunch menus, only to be told after we had our drinks and decided on our meals that we were given the wrong menus and needed to have them swapped for the \"more expensive\" dinner menus. So we ordered still and we're not impressed to find out the portions were the same just more expensive. Needless to say we will not eat here again. I had the carne asada, something I usually enjoy and it came to the table I was unimpressed. Rice and beans had no flavor and the steak was just alright. You would expect an amazing flavor and difference of portions. I should of listened to other reviews and went elsewhere. If they didn't already include the tip we wouldn't have even tipped our lousy server who it took 5 mins to track down for salt & pepper."}
{"text":"I am so happy we chose to go here for dinner. The views on downtown from the patio were amazing. The food was delicious. We had the guac and queso with chicken to start, both were phenomenal. My husband had the salmon and I thought he may lick his plate clean. The drinks were pretty pricey but delicious. I highly recommend the blackberry margarita.

Our server Adrian was enthusiastic and very knowledgeable about the menu and the cooking methods. She could even remark on the origin on some of the ingredients. She was great."}
{"text":"All in all it was a very enjoyable experience. 

There were a few small kinks (probably due to the fact that they've been open a week). The glasses on our table weren't perfectly clean. And when one of my party ordered an eggplant dish, they served her squash because they had run out of eggplant- a fact which they neglected to tell our poor waitress. 

On to happier news! The squash dish was incredible and the rest of my family shared it! We ordered guac and chips and the root fries for appetizers both of which were awesome! The root fries in particular were really innovative and served with a light habañero ketchup. I ordered the vegetable and tofu burrito which was also really excellent. The availability of vegetarian/vegan options was a huge plus for me. All the food at the restaurant was nicely presented, really modern and creative, and flavorful and delicious. Our waitress was incredibly sweet and helpful and the location is ideal. I feel confident that they will grow into a 5 star restaurant soon."}
{"text":"Why one star,  Simply put I am writing this review as I am waiting to receive our check.  Food was okay, but the service is horrendous.  To elaborate, waitress never took my drink order, and then never refilled my water.  If I am ever in Cleveland again I will not return to this place."}
{"text":"AWFUL!!!!! 1st off we had reservations for my birthday. They tried to sit us at a dirty table where people were already sitting.  So they sat us next to the bar. We were sitting over 10 minutes b4 the server came over to introduce himself.  We were sitting so close to the bar that B4 we could order drinks the bartender dropped a bucket of cucumber puree and it exploded all over the place and landed on the back of my husbands new dress shirt. Then the server finally came over and I said something about my husbands  shirt and he quickly discarded it. I hardly ever drink so when I drink I get buzzed off a couple sips.  I drank an entire margarita and did not catch any sort of warm fuzzy feeling so u KNOW there was No tequila in the drink. We had to pay for chips and salsa that u could tell came out of a jar and a bag. Not home made at all!  25 minutes later still waiting for the server to come back and take our dinner order. We finally were able to order our food and my husband ordered the pork dish with rice and beans.  It took anther 40 minutes to get our food.  We watched people get served 1st who sat after us. Then when the dish came it was completely ALL fat! A couple little pieces of meat and the rest was a big lump of fat! It quickly turned us off and i asked for the server to take it off the check and bring us the bill.  In a matter of 4 minutes they had anther pork dish on our table, ( if it was home made then how did it come out in 4 minutes? ) also some random guy sitting at the bar asking us if we want more water \"cuz it was free\" he said, lol, and the bill!!! Noooo thank u!! Take my word... DON'T waste ur time or money! It was NOT GOOD! Definitly NOTHING special here! Completely mediocre food for outrageous prices! 11$ for a drink with no booze, 19$ for a plate of fat!?!? REALLY BRO!?!?!"}
{"text":"Great location and space. I liked the atmosphere and the staff are very nice. The outdoor seating is great and there are very comfy couches/chairs. The presentation for the food is also great. It is kind of expensive - everything is $14.90. The food comes out super hot (temperature wise) so make sure not to burn your tongue when you eat. The food is good and tasty. The quesadilla is delicious and I love that they add squash and more unique veggies than in your traditional quesadilla. It was a healthy Mexican meal."}
{"text":"We heard the akron location is very good so came here because it's much closer to home for us. The location and view are incredible. Never saw cleveland from that perspective. Truly amazing. The building is new and spectacular. Worth the visit to see the building and the view. We were there on a Saturday night. The place was 1/2 full. The server was ok. The drinks were ok, had margarita and was very light on booze. The salsa and guacamole were disappointing, store bought is better. And the salsa is not complimentary. The quesadilla was very good and nice size portion. The beans and rice were tasteless. The Margarita was $9 and quesadilla $14. The food took over an hour to come. 3 of the 8 dishes were wrong, and it took 20 minutes for them to come back correct. This place needs a good manger, it was obvious there wasn't one present or they are very ineffective. It's a shame this place was so disappointing, if the food and service were just average it would be ok because of the location and view. If things don't change soon I don't think it will be in business long."}
{"text":"The drinks were amazing, the margarita flight were to die for, got a couple of them.
we also decided to come back for dinner at night, however it lacked flavors, but the overall experience was a good one, would just go back for drinks next time"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I may be biased as a native Texan and living in Dallas for over 20 years where 1 out of every 4 restaurants serves pretty good Mexican cuisine. 

That being said, Nuevo has a fabulous location! Right on the water, with a beautiful patio, it's no wonder this place is always packed with locals and tourists. Nuevo has a lot of things working in its favor: the location on Lake Erie next to the museums and the airport, the fact that it is new, the hip cool modern atmosphere, the outdoor seating for summertime, etc. So realistically, Nuevo could serve cold queso and stale chips and still make a profit. Good for them! 

Pros: location and atmosphere

Cons: The whole point of having a restaurant. The FOOD! Prepare to spend too much money on mediocre \"Mexican\". They try to be fancy and combine unique ingredients but this doesn't even taste good and it isn't done well. I mean.. come on... Blue cheese in guacamole?

Nuevo has potential. It's a new restaurant and they are still figuring things out. I'll give it another try sometime."}
{"text":"AMAZINGLY cheap happy hour its ($3.45 for queso and home made blue corn tortilla chips)

We stopped here to wet our whistle after the RRHoF.  They had a lot of happy hour cocktails - I had a fruity tea beer (yes I know...sounds weird). they also had 3 or 4 different kinds of fresh margaritas. My man had 2 different spicy ones, a mango and a cilantro one. Both very good.

The Queso was supposed to be plain (no added protein, I think the protein options were chicken or shrimp), and SUPER LUCKY us, it came with pork - which was very tasty, the bartenders said that pork is not even an option and thought I maybe got chicken, but when I pulled out a piece and it shredded, we all agreed it was pork. I should have played the lottery that day, 'cause I sure was lucky!

Bartenders were great and knowledgeable about Cleveland and the restaurant scene.

I HIGHLY recommend this place if you were parked for the RRHoF and still had time to kill before your meter expired. You are welcome for the fantastic tip!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places where you \"pay for the view\", except both times I've been, the upper floor (the one with the views) is reserved for a private party. When you sit at the bar, you'll be looking in the one direction that there is not a Great Lake.

I'n not exaggerating when I say that I could have paid $30 and made far better Mexican food at home (Bill was about $100 all told, for my girlfriend and I). Nothing was inedible, but it was all very bland. To take just one example, the beans and rice tasted exactly like someone had cooked white rice, dumped in a can of black beans, and warmed it up. Literally every single tex-mex place I've been to has been leaps and bounds ahead of Nuevo, let alone legit mexican spots.

Here's my recommendation: Don't go to this restaurant. Instead, go somewhere like La Plaza (Lakewood) or El Caribe (2906 Fulton), get some truly delicious food to go for a fraction of the price, then come back to the E.9th pier, sit in the park, and enjoy the view while you eat. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Have been to the Nuevo in Akron and this was a lackluster substitute. The service was just ok. The ceviche was forgettable. Even the margaritas (which are normally fresh, fruity and light) were syrupy and lacking. We will try it again because the location is superb. Hopefully things improve."}
{"text":"Really good food!  Even things like basic chips and salsa have and amazing spice blend and so flavorful!  Very fresh ingredients, and good menu selections.  Service was great and a fun location."}
{"text":"Would not come back here. Service was really poor.  Had to reorder our guac because the server didn't get it the first time. There was absolutely no music and for such an awesome location the vibe was really dragging. When we asked if there was music the manager gave us an attitude. And not to mention the terrible drinks. If you like ice you're in luck...they use ALOT. The sangria tasted like robutussin and all the margs were painfully sugary with a lack of tequila. The food was fine, but brought out wrong and at this point we had made two comments and weren't about to make a third. Such a disappointment for a place with so much potential. :("}
{"text":"Great new restaurant!! Great food!!!..AMAZING! Try the chorizo queso. Being a new restaurant it's a little slow (be patient...we all know Rome wasn't built in a day) but the setting makes up for it."}
{"text":"My family and girlfriend went to Nuevo in Cleveland for my birthday. I absolutely love Mexican food so I was really excited to try it out.The drinks and queso were excellent - we all ordered the mango jalapeno margarita and it was AMAZING. Guac was just okay..wouldn't order again.

The food....was horrific. There were 6 of us and not ONE person liked what they ordered. I cannot believe i'm saying this about Mexican food, but it needed salt!! There was absolutely no flavor. I ordered (one of the) only vegetarian options on the menu - the veggie burrito. It was basically a tortilla with almost exclusively arugula inside covered with butternut squash puree. It sounded unappetizing but I was sure it was just the description so i ordered it. It was exactly what it sounds like..undressed salad in a tortilla with mushy topping. Please make a veggie burrito, veggie tacos, or SOMETHING that isn't so..weird. Keep it more simple!!! The beans and rice didn't even have flavor. :(

Overall disappointing but the drinks and service were good."}
{"text":"We stopped here on a Friday afternoon for a snack.  Ordered a flight of margaritas and chicken queso.  Margaritas were delicious.  I loved the spicy one.  My fiance loved the blackberry.  The queso was very good also.  Large portion.  We sat outside on the patio and the view is spectacular."}
{"text":"The location was great. I loved looking at down town cle over dinner. The down side was how long it took for the food to come and how it was okay. Nothing to write home about but it is for sure a place worth going to at least once."}
{"text":"I have never been treated worse. Our server treated us with such disrespect that we almost left. We said we had questions and he rolled his eyes and walked away. I wouldn't recommend to anybody."}
{"text":"A unique take on Mexican food, great service, cool location. Had a trio of guac to start: classic, pepper jelly, and the goat cheese. Loved the first two, wasn't fond of the goat cheese guac. The chips are delish, plentiful, and came out warm. Ordered the espresso carne asada. For someone who doesn't drink coffee, I was nervous this was going to have a coffee taste and turn me off. I was wrong- this was amazing!! Good size portion of meat too. Rice and beans accompanied (can choose black or pinto, I chose pinto) and neither was great. The carne asada was very salty and it seemed that both the rice and beans were fairly bland. I love salt, and I even felt that the meat was too salty. Others in my party ordered shrimp tacos, grouper tacos, carnitas, and a pork burrito. A common theme with the food was a little too salty on everything. It was my birthday so they brought out a glass of patron and a chocolate cake. Both were good. Overall, very happy with the service and the food. Would recommend as a nice- casual place in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Expensive but worth it. Everything was delicious, great service. We had calamari for an appetizer
 Best ever!!. Over $400 for 6 people but damn everything done right!!  Margaritas were delicious."}
{"text":"Went here to try out the food, my boyfriend and I are always riding our motorcycles by the pier for the view and to meet up with other riders. So trying this restaurant out was a must! 

We went for lunch, our server was Kelsey! She was awesome, great out-going and friendly as can be. 

Unfortunately, our food fell short. We ordered the queso dip and chips to start, the queso had a chalky consistently. I did not enjoy it, then we ordered a burrito with bean sprouts on it with rice and beans which my boyfriend and I shared. The burrito was okay, however the two side dishes fell short which were rice and pinto beans. We just ate the burritos and left the side dishes. 

For close to $32 including tip, this was very disappointing."}
{"text":"We were in town for a conference and decided to check out this restaurant. We came away very impressed. The wait staff was great. The food was even better. I'm not exactly sure what I had except that there were scallops in it and I loved it. I enjoyed sitting outside and enjoying a nice breeze. Will be back if I return to Cleveland."}
{"text":"The location is fantastic with spectacular views of the city's skyline, and the lakefront. Outdoor seating, and a beautiful modern indoor dining area. Truly lovely. 

The wheels fell of when my entree arrived. I had the tamale that comes with a side of rice and choice of pinto or black beans. I chose the pinto beans, and they were flavorless and undercooked. They definitely could have used some more time in the pot. The rice was also on the bland side of boring. It was like the kitchen forgot to use any seasoning. Now in regards to the tamale (you only get one for $11) it was a disaster. The poor thing was covered in some sort of stewed eggplant and onion paste that was bitter and sweet at the same time. I ended up scraping it all off after one bite. The masa and meat (pulled pork) were also keeping with the theme of no flavor. This was perhaps the most embarrassing attempt at a tamale I have ever seen. 

Now, it wasn't all terrible. Their queso fundido was spectacular! It had an awesome layer of grilled/toasted cheese. The guacamole was also spot on. 

I also tried their house Margarita, and it was nice and refreshing. 

I'm giving 3 stars because I want to believe the tamale incident will not carry over to the rest of the menu as the other items ordered were tasty. 

I'll be back, and update accordingly!"}
{"text":"Nice stop outside of R & R Museum. Delicious trio of salsas, with organic chips. We had the chili pork shoulder as tacos. The flavors were magnificant. We didn't have liquor, but they had very large selections. Reasonable prices. Impeccablee service!"}
{"text":"This place is LEGIT! Hats off to the chef and kitchen crew as well as the bar. This is a must when in town."}
{"text":"I've only been to this relatively new restaurant once and I'm going to go back soon to give it another try.  I had a blood orange margarita and it was delicious!  My husband tried a flight of tequila and he enjoyed that.  The service was knowledgeable and attentive.  I'm sure this would be a great place when the weather is good; the view was beautiful even on a cold, fall night.  My only complaint was the food seemed a little bland for a Mexican restaurant.  We started with queso and guacamole with chips and then I had the Pollo Crema and my husband had the Carnitas as entrees.  Everything tasted good but, again, was a little bland.  Maybe we'll try something else on our next visit."}
{"text":"2 visits:

First visit: happy hour at a high top in the bar area. Prices are phenomenal during happy hour.

Second visit: left a lot to be desired. The food is incredibly overpriced. I have no problem paying steep prices but the execution was so poor the prices are not justified. The pinto beans tasted like someone opened a can and strained the beans and put them on the plate. Ordered the carne Asada - very dry and very little seasoning.

Disappointed since the location is amazing"}
{"text":"Don't think that this is your ordinary Mexican/Latino restaurant.. We underestimated it at first.... After spending 4 hours here, we was greatly impressed with the food and margaritas. The Huitlacoche steak was a complete mouth-gasm!! Yuuum!!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience here this evening with our family.  Daniel our server did a great job.  The drinks were great (margaritas).    Chips, queso , Guacamole and salsa were very tasty and so were our entrees.   We took it to the next level and went for it sharing 3 different deserts, all 3 tasty.   Tropical layer cake was amazing.   Great location also in Voinovich Park!!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of the Nuevo in Akron, so I was really excited to check out the new one in Cleveland. It's much more modern than its Akron location, and there is a big patio and volleyball court attached. The food and service were just as good as the Akron version, too, but there was just something about the ambiance inside that I just couldn't get on board with. It felt almost chaotic. The music was loud - the kind with drums beating that gives you a little anxiety, and there were at least 3 or 4 loud bangs from plates dropped or furniture tipping over. I just felt like I couldn't relax. Maybe it will work itself out after they've been open for a little while longer."}
{"text":"What? This place? 
First off bartenders counting tips next to the bar. Zero eye contact. Exhausted and clearly annoyed manager asking us after 15+ minutes \"do you want something to drink\"
Threw menus at us. I could go on about how bad it was but I'm basically lazy at writing reviews.
Bottom line I was raised on tips my mom made from a Mexican restaurant. These folks need to learn how to act.
Worst customer service EVER."}
{"text":"This is not Mexican food it really made puke and made my stomach hurt I do not want to come here ever again."}
{"text":"Go here for the views and a flight of margaritas.  They have several different flavors (all delicious) that you can pair with several different rims, 3 for $8.  (I can't speak for the food - I've been here several times for drinks only.)"}
{"text":"Visited here while traveling.  Super close to Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Big crowd as many of us were there before a concert at the also close by stadium.  Great vibe.  Waterfront location is amazing.  Bar scene was fun.  One hour wait was accurate.  Margaritas and drink selection with extensive tequila choices was impressive.  Loved the custom rim selection, my favorite being the chili salt.  I was happy with my margarita, hand made no mixes.  Food was not well received overall by our group.  I personally LOVED the queso.  Made with real cheeses and blue corn tortilla chips dusted with chili powder.  Honestly so good.  Not everyone in our group agreed with me.  Vegetarian tofu tacos were great, chicken quesadilla (made special not on the menu) was good but bland, goat tacos were good but rice and beans were really not liked by any of us.  You pay for the location and drinks here.  Don't go for the food."}
{"text":"I should've known the restaurant was flash over substance when the Hostess lied saying they had \"reservations\" for the other tables when I asked to be moved to a table that wasn't across the bathroom. I think the look of disbelief is what got us a table near the bar but the experience should've been a warning that this stylish restaurant lacked food substance.  To start, I and my two companions ordered the empanadas as an appetizer.  The waiter failed to mention the $7+ per plate only came with two palm sized empanadas. Stylishly plated, we looked forward to trying them. Imagine the look on our faces when we bit into not a light crunch but a mushy phyllo dough that enclosed a bland unappetizing combination of liquid cheese, spinach and corn. If they had served a hot pocket, it would've exceeded the flavors of the poorly done appetizer.  Disappointed we waited for our entrées. I ordered jerk shrimp tacos while my companions chose tamales.  When the food arrived I knew that we were to be disappointed again.  Mine arrived with a bowl filled with cooked vegetables and boiled shrimp that were obviously of the cheap grocery store frozen variety any housewife can buy for a cheap seafood night a home. Their quality so poor that to fry them would cause a family revolt at the dinner table. As I looked at my food shocked as to how anyone could call this mess in front of me jerk shrimp with a mango slaw, my friends looked upon open faced \"tamales\" with a rather ugly tan mole sauce.  Now, anyone,who has eaten real tamales, knows that this is never a good sign especially when the \"tamale\" is not a compacted cylinder but sloppy mound.  I haven't discussed taste because this restaurant doesn't CARE about it. I think most of its business is tourist because I know ohioans have taste. You may ask why we stayed after just seeing the disaster of our food it was only because I was torn between suffering a diabetic coma or eating. In the future, I'll have to consider the coma a better choice and save myself $70 dollars for lunch."}
{"text":"Unfortunately everything about this place was pretty bad. Not much was fresh - margaritas were PRE-mixed and poured into glasses (and way too sweet), gauc was also PRE-made and not very tasty, and even the my salmon torre dish was pre-assembled. Furthermore, everything was way too seasoned! I love spicy and flavorful food, but this was not that, it was just way too much seasoning. 

Sad because the location is awesome but really worth worth eating here."}
{"text":"I am confused by all of the terrible reviews on here regarding service.  We had amazing service by everyone we encountered - front desk, waiter, and the owner.  Everyone seemed genuinely cheerful and did not mind moving us when we asked to sit near the water view.  Our entrees were hot, cooked perfectly (scallops & sirloin) and we did not have long waits for anything.  If I had read these reviews before going I might have skipped Nuevo- I'm so glad I didn't !"}
{"text":"Great location on the lake and within walking distance of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The building is crisp and modern huge windows to let the natural light and lake views in. Long story really short we weren't greeted when entering. We waited at the sign that says Wait to be seated and nobody showed for 3 mins. We were about to leave and someone finally showed up to seat us. We sat at the table for about 7mins then finally someone showed up with water. We put in our whole order knowing nobody would be back for a while and that is exactly what happened. The food was just ok. I wouldn't go back for the food."}
{"text":"The service was great. The tequila was great. The view was great. The food was very bland. Portions were fine but the whole flavor experience was nonexistent."}
{"text":"This place is very scenic on the water, a cool place for groups. We came here for a large work dinner and sat upstairs.  It looked like they were still doing construction in the upstairs bar area. We sat in the adjoining room at the top of the stairs. The servers were very attentive and helpful. 

Honestly the best thing I had all night was the empanadas on the appetizer menu. So good. Creamy with corn on the inside - crispy and fried on the outside.  Must try. 

I ordered a spicy mango margarita because I'm obsessed with a sweet and spicy combo in most things. This was good. It was spicy. But the mango was almost too heavy. I prefer like a pineapple jalapeño version. 

The salsa is amazing here. Homemade, not spicy at all, chunky with fresh tomatoes. Really good. Guac also really great.  The chips are sprinkled with something that I really loved too - some type of subtle spice. 

For dinner I ordered the carne asada with the corn cake instead of the beans. The corn cake was really tasty. Had mushrooms in it, slightly sweet. The carne asada was cooked ok - medium rare. The steak was not super tender though. Thicker than most I have tried - usually the carne I get is a skirt steak but this was thicker. 

The desserts were something left to be desired. I am a dessert person. I actually love tres leches cake and this version was not my favorite.  The cake was hard and not very moist. This cake is actually supposed to be soaked and it was not. We also had the margarita cupcake and the icing was very solid and sweet. It was just ok, it was not bad though. Nothing I would order again on either."}
{"text":"In Cleveland, I thought this place was awesome for Mexican food. My server was very accommodating and everything went well. Unfortunately I have to stay on the mild side when it comes to spicy food and the chef prepared it exactly the way i like it. First off I had the Guacamole as an app and it was excellent. Then I had an interesting dish that you might be grossed out when I tell you, but it was delicious. It was beef tongue tacos. The meat was tender and the accompaniments were excellent. I wasn't in the mood for a Margarita, but they sure looked look. This place is conveniently located just outside of the Rock and Roll Hall of fame which is a must even if you don't like Rock music. I great way to end the day. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"We hosted our wedding reception here this past weekend and it was absolute perfection.  The upstairs event space is stunning, with a beautiful balcony that wraps almost entirely around the restaurant and provides amazing views of Lake Erie and the downtown skyline.  The waitstaff and event coordinators (Erin and Amanda) are SO accommodating and easy to work with, and the bartenders (Eric and Kyle) were friendly, outgoing, and super attentive.  I got so many compliments from my guests throughout the night and the next day about how much they enjoyed the space, the food, and the views/ambiance.  Cannot recommend this place highly enough to anyone looking for a beautiful, foolproof place to host an event in Cleveland!  We can't wait to come back and just enjoy the view and reminisce about our wonderful wedding :-)."}
{"text":"Location....cool
Parking....handled
Ambience.....sweet
Staff....nice
Bartenders. ....yesss
Food....amazing! 

Those of you who know me,  know I keep it real! 
This lil new, trendy, hipster spot on the Pier is the bomb-doggity! I said it.

If you like Latin, this is better than Paladar. Better than the Shaker Square or west side. Yesss. I said it again. 

If you love Tequila. If you love the salt rim variety.  If you love just good, ethnic. .. get in here and enjoy!

The staff love to please. We enjoyed the knowing  Carey at the bar.  He had winderful, confirmed suggestions such as the Habari Jelly Guac, the Tequila grilled Camarones with a delightful veggie toss in olive oil and the Spoon Bread (2 orders).

They Love to hear feedback and mine was all good. I ain't no slouch either when it comes to telling you what's going on and telling it like it is! 

A lovely view of the City, the Lake , the Rock n Roll -Science Museum - Browns (who?) Stadium.. it's right here. Upstairs patio to soak it all in... downstairs patio to people watch...actually three sides to be nosey. .. see ya soon!!!"}
{"text":"The food was good.  The service left a lot to be desired.  We were excited to go and try Nuevo, but looking back, we weren't all that impressed.

Game 6 of the world series was happening and we were happy that the place wasn't even remotely busy. 

The building is impressive. And the inside was nice, if not a little stuffy.  Very upscale feeling and nice.  But the service didn't match.  We found our server to be a bit put out by our presence.  And it seemed as if some how we interrupted his business.  

The food was okay.  My wife thought the scallops were perfectly cooked.  And everything else was okay.  The salsa trio was good.  The Verde wasn't great.  But the other two were good.

I had the chorizo burrito and it was okay, but felt like it was a bit underwhelming. For want we paid.  $80 after a carafe of margaritas, some salsa, and two entrees, we should have been blown away.  

We were not. And don't think we will go back.  A generic Mexican joint is half the price and better for a night out."}
{"text":"Food is very bland and just ok. I had higher hopes for this place because its location is excellent. Makes me think of an Mod Mex version of an Applebee's with cookie cutter food. Men's room door fell off of its hinges when I opened it. Our waitress (Sara)was very good and friendly. Margaritas are pure premix.   Would definitely not be back based on the food and drinks but may give it another try because of the location."}
{"text":"Horrible. Great location/atmosphere but that's where it ends. Wrong order was given to us and then just laughed off by the waiter. Ordered the carne asada and it wasn't cooked. At that point we had enough so decided to leave with no credit to our bill. Took a while for the bill to arrive because the wait staff is busy taking tequila shots. At least somebody was having a good time. Only good thing is that we can say we tried it but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Prime Location - Parking could pose concerns

Nothing to write home about Guac or Sides

Pretty slow and forgot an entreee

A busser spilled some water on my head

Menus were almost illegible 

Will not be going back, other than to play volleyball, anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great home grown food! Roof top garden! Home infused liqours! And great service! Try the plaintains and empanadas!"}
{"text":"Just OK  - waiter and patio were great. The queso fundido was weird, watery and didnt taste like anything. The chips were covered in some red seasoning that got all over your fingers  worse than Doritos.  Pretty hard to mess up melted cheese but they achieved it somehow. '

Nothing on the menu sounded very appetizing..beef tounge, grapefruit ceviche, braised goat...  trying to be too fancy when yall know we just want a chicken burrito if we are getting Mexican."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure to travel down to Nuevo last night with a few co workers. It was a Tuesday so of course we did not make a reservation, we were told it would be able 25 min wait so we decided on taking the bar seats open. I always enjoy the bar because then you can watch them work as you wait anxiously for your food. We started off with the Jelly Guac- super good a little sweet and comes with a bowl of blue chips. Since we were still hungry we ordered queso and plantains. The Planatins came with a sweet sauce as well really delicious. But the Queso was the star of the show. The cheese they used was the best ingredients! I ordered pork tacos kinda surprised it only came with a few tortillas for more than three tacos worth of meat. The bar staff was great super talented at making drinks while chatting with guest shows such confidence. I did see so many poor reviews but I believe they need to be a little more open minded on how tough it is to open a new restaurant with new staff to learn how to handle such high volume. Go check Nuevo for yourself and enjoy the beautiful sunset !"}
{"text":"i'm honestly shocked this restaurant only has 3 stars! #fakenews 

i was in cleveland for the first time this past weekend seeing coldplay, and the morning after we decided to hit up the rock hall. saw this place was nearby and served brunch (YAS) and stopped in to grub. 

i started with the captain frank (?). i think that's his name. heh. it was basically a jazzed up bloody mary. i appreciated the horseradish and cucumber--really lightened up the drink. 

next i got the espanola tortilla. (note: the brunch menu is not listed online so forgive me if i butchered that). it was basically a frittata/quiche/omelette kind of mix and i got two HUGE slices. with that were \"root fries\".. i was expecting french fries but they looked like taro fries and tasted DIVINE. seriously. i want some more right now. our server brought me their house salsa + peach habanero and jalapeno chipotle sauces and they all rocked. 

overall this place was great. their guac selection was extensive and i wish i could've tried some of that. it's very modern and bright inside and the views of the great lake are amazing."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk into Nuevo you know you are in for a treat. The atmosphere of being right in Voinovich Park and on the water is perfect. Our server was extremely helpful in selecting our drinks, appetizer and entrees. I definitely recommend the spicy mango or classic margarita and the scallop entree!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't great, service poor, wait long, prices high, hostesses grumpy.

Great location."}
{"text":"I wanted to do some modeling but I ended up modernling instead, which basically means being naked on a webcam for some old dude. Welcome to 2017.

But back to the food.

I'm not surprised the reviews are low, but I also am because usually people are quite easily fooled in the US when it comes to Mexican food. This is not Mexican food by any stretch of the imagination - it's overpriced Tex-Mex, but it's not bad to be honest. It's a little too expensive for me to give it 4 stars, but I certainly don't hate it, and it's decent at the very least.

My salad was okay, not bad, and at least it was somewhat cheap. There are 1,300 places I'd rather eat in Cleveland though. So there's nuevo I'll be coming back (get it - no way)."}
{"text":"New but slow service with mediocre food - rice was dry,beans overly spicey, and unimpressive. No salsa and chips on the table and a long wait for \"child's\" portion. People who came in after we ordered got served before our table. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Had dinner here tonight and it was a truly great experience.  I loved the food, service, and decor.  We sat at the bar and our bartender Eric was absolutely wonderful. He helped make my meal with pleasant conversation and service. Eric is a great bartender and you can tell he enjoys good drinks and food. The drinks he prepared were absolutely delicious and flavorful. I highly recommend asking for him. Incredible!!!!  I will be back and probably a regular when I return to Cleveland in a few months."}
{"text":"I hope management read these posts. Please hire experienced Mexican cooks, food will taste better. It's not real Mexican food, their pico de gallo was actually Salsa from a jar."}
{"text":"Carne Asada excellent. Queso with chorizo excellent. Margaritas. Well yea.. those were good."}
{"text":"If I could give a -5 star rating to a restaurant I would of done that here. I went to Nuevo for the first time last night against my better judgement. I had heard from multiple people that the service is extremely slow and the food is subpar. I knew this going in but I figured I would give it a shot.  I went there with 5 other people so we had a party of 6. The restaurant was half empty around 7 p.m. And the service was AWFUL. Again we had party of 6 people and it took about 10 minutes just to receive our waters, and then about an additional 25min to get our drinks that we ordered.  When we received our drinks the waiter then left the table again without taking our food order.

Once we finally ordered, it took almost an hour to receive our food! The chips and guacamole are \"meh\" and the queso is also subpar. I ordered the quesadilla, a simple dish really, but it was hands down the worst quesadilla I have ever had. The Spanish rice was awful and the black beans were garbage. Oh yea and I forgot to mention, the meal didn't come with sour cream (weird because it's a quesadilla) but then they charged me extra for a side of sour cream!!! Like what!? For 4 alcoholic drinks, 2 entrees, and the table split the guacamole and queso, for my girlfriend and I it was $90 before tip!!!!  When I compare this place to like a Barrio, it doesn't even compare.  I don't mind paying good money for good food and good service but paying over $100 for terrible food and service sucked mucho.

It's so unfortunate that this place is this bad and this overpriced because it's in amazing spot. The view from this place is amazing."}
{"text":"Ok so this is a beautiful place right on the water so if you want to go here, recommend a reservation or do like my friend and I did and go to the bar to order right away. Ordered the beef tongue taco which was amazing! Loved the food and the service was good even though it was busy. Would def go again :)"}
{"text":"First, the location is attractive and the dining room is very nice. It offers a clean, modern look, but remains warm and comfortable. The summer is nice because their many windows allows natural light to shine in. Also, they have an excellent patio.

Sadly, location and ambience are the only positive things I can offer in this review. The food was mediocre and in some cases, just not tasty. The menu lists items that sound authentic and delicious, but most things we ate were pedestrian at best. Their blue corn chips were nice. Thin, crispy, and warm. They were a nice vehicle for their guacamole. We ordered the Guacamole trio and the plain tasted the best, but was under seasoned. Forgo the specialty ones. Their Queso Fundido was hot and cheesy, but again, under seasoned. The jalapeño garnish gave it some flavor.

Folks in our group tried the Coca-Cola beef tacos, Cerdo Divertido Burrito, Carnitas, and Cuban Sandwich. All dishes were underwhelming. To varrying degrees, all the dishes were surprisingly dry. The beef in the tacos and the Carnitas were dry  and near chalky. The beef had decent flavor, but it's brittle, dry texture really ruined the dish. Carnitas are supposed to be very tender and unctuous. These were tough and dry. The burrito and Cuban sandwich are both breadier options and needed more condiments. They were under dressed.

Lastly, the price point for their food is way too high especially for the quality. \"School cafeteria\" and \"generic\" were terms we used to describe the food. The flavor in most of these dishes showed good effort and potential, but were just so poorly executed, in my opinion.

The server staff were generally attentive, warm, and courteous. We always had water in our glasses and they checked in a few times.  Though, on two occasions, one server was unable to describe dishes that peaked our interest. \"It's hard to describe\" is where they left it."}
{"text":"Shame on anyone who gave this place less than 5 stars!!! The name intrigued me...they had me at tequila. My husband and a friend of ours came here for lunch after touring the Rock Hall. This place was bustling and we were able to get 3 seats at the bar. I was mesmerized by the mixologists (and they were truly mixologists proud of their craft.) they had a huge list of drinks and helped me narrow down my choice to a simple margarita. But this simple drink was anything but!  So refreshing and he tequila was so smooth. I got a brief lesson on how the Patron tequila was unique and can only be found at that restaurant!! Patron is a feature tequila of this bar and they carry limited barrels which make your drinks truly special.  The food was tasty and flavorful...you could tell that the simple chicken tacos had fresh herbs and sauces. Truly an experience and the fact this was on the lake was special.  Have to go!!!"}
{"text":"We tried this place over the holiday weekend and really wanted to like it, but just couldn't. 

First, the atmosphere and location are awesome and are really what made me even consider two stars for this restaurant. 

The food was tasteless and very unremarkable. Both our entries, shrimp tacos and Mahi tacos had no taste at all. They also charged for salsa which for a Mexican restaurant is a bit strange, but I get it, new place, high rent. Our food also took about 50 minutes to come out and the kids were done by that time. 

It wasn't the wait for our food, charge for salsa or anything else that made me give this place 2 stars, it was solely that the food wasn't very good. There are plenty of much better Mexican choices in Cleveland. 

If you are just looking for drinks in a cool atmosphere with awesome views, this is your place. If you want good Mexican along with it, skip this place and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Skip the food and go for a drink to experience the nice lakefront location-its obvious strength. We were served blue corn chips that were totally devoid of any seasoning, no corn taste either, (these were NOT complimentary). We mentioned this to the server and she indicated we were alone in our belief, that there was paprika on them (since when does paprika have any salty taste?).  The accompanying \"salsa\" was nothing more than a can of Rotel tomatoes dumped in a cup-no significant seasoning, garlic, cilantro, chilis or anything, and the huge \"steamed\" tough chunks of tomatoe were gross. Thanks to the manager who did come around to ask how we enjoyed the meal, he did comp the chips/salsa and gave a small rebate. He seemed to care. The tamales were ok. Would not go back for food."}
{"text":"Food is incredible!! I had lunch burrito of steak, green beans, black beans, and rice. The rice has an amazing aroma that you \"taste\" more through the smell in your nose as you are eating. Meat perfectly seasoned, black beans not too salty, and green beans are perfectly crunchy. Top that with a great view of Lake Erie, and you're set!! Anytime I am back in Cleveland, I will definitely be here!!"}
{"text":"Pretentious atmosphere and price. Pedestrian food and service."}
{"text":"Never again! I was out with my husband, buying tickets in Cleveland. We both wanted to try something new, and we did. To start, we ended up paying $10 to park. There are parking lot attendants, but they don't take your money. So, we ended up paying cash to a machine that gives no change. Sadly, that was the best part of our experience. Our waiter was really sweet, and explained the menu, since we were new to the place. We ordered the Fundito cheese dip with chips. It was pretty good, but seemed overpriced. My husband got the Choritzo burrito, pintos, and the rice. I had the chicken burrito with rice and spoonbread. Neither of us made much headway on our meals. The rice was so incredibly sticky. I can eat almost any type of rice, but it was like glue! The burritos were awful, mostly because it was like eating baby food. The chicken in mine was so pulverized, that I couldn't get in more than three bites. And the spoonbread...it was a little square corn cake, that was completely charred all around. I'm not talking a little overdone on the top, it literally looked like a cube of charcoal, and tasted like it. I ate as much of the burnt up spoonbread as I could stand. I ended up asking for sour cream, basically to get the taste out of my mouth. The beans that my husband had were terrible as well. They tasted as though they had been soaked in booze. I felt bad when the waiter asked how everything was, since our plates had barely been touched. I ended up lying and saying it was fine. I mean, it's not his fault that food was atrocious. In the end, it turned out to be about a $60-70 mistake. We did pay, because we weren't looking for a free meal or discount. All I can say is that if you've never been there, make sure you've got plenty of money to thrown down. The other people seemed to love it, maybe the margaritas deaden the taste buds."}
{"text":"Our Friday evening started off okay with a trip to the bar. Our bartender was attentive and the margarita flight was fantastic, although they were out of half the items listed on the menu. Once the rest of our party was ready and the table was cleared, we ordered some more drinks and appetizers. This came out quickly and was very good. After the waitress took our order, she was not to be seen for at least another 15 minutes. Our waters were never filled, table was crowded with menus, plates, empty glasses, etc..., and my friend was ready to order a different drink. Eventually another person brought out our food. We asked for water refills and to see our waitress to order more drinks (none of us had anything to drink when our food was delivered). At this time, the waitress came back and said we could not have what we wanted because they were out of a mixer and we waited another 5-10 min. for our next drink order. The food was mediocre at best; our rice was unbelievably crunchy. A woman who appeared to be the manager stopped by, we expressed our frustrations, and she graciously took off 50% of our bill. However, she proceeded to scold our waitress two times on the restaurant floor. Our waitress awkwardly apologized and brought out our checks and some more chips once we had said we were done eating."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT!! Great food, extraordinary service. Highly recommended.  What a pleasant experience,  every staff member we encountered made us their top priority. We will return next time we are in town. Well done! Thank you Nuevo for a memorable time. 
P.s. The guacamole,  peach habenero chicken tacos and jerk shrimp tacos were divine!! ;)"}
{"text":"That was delicious. Yelpers, you had me thinking it was just ambiance. It's actually great ambiance, good service, and great food!

When I walked out of the Rock & Roll Museum, I was hungry (as I didn't want a $12 deli sandwich). All I saw, like a mirage on the horizon, was this contemporary brown building, by a pretty lawn patch, on the water.  It's a pretty day; let's do it.

I walked in to a pretty bustling joint. Three drink menus, and a dinner menu. The dinner menu looked pricey (for Mexican food), but exactly as I like things, with an original twist (e.g., it's MODERN MEX).

I had Root Fries (taro root with rock salt), shortbread corn (i.e., corn souffle), and shrimp tacos. Yum! Ma had chicken tacos with pinto beans and rice. Yum! The plates were pretty presentations. Both of our selections were good--and filling. No room for what looked to be delectable desserts.

Also, our server was nice, competent, and friendly--as were other servers passing that I bothered for this and that."}
{"text":"What a wonderful evening we just had at Nuevo Modern Mexican & Tequila Bar. The food fabulous! Enjoyed Haberno Jelly Guac for an appetizer...not spicy at all. The 3 of us had seafood for our entrees and they we each perfectly prepared. My scallops we tender and perfectly seared. The libations were also outstanding! Our server Victor made the experience even better. Prices were reasonable for a upscale restaurant. I would highly recommend this establishment to everyone. My only complaint is the parking. Options either valet or pay via parking meter. $8 for 1-2 hours or $15 for the whole day. Needless to say should have paid for the whole day instead of having to go out in the middle of dinner. More importantly read all the directions on the meter because it does not disperse change! $20 down the tubes! Again the restaurant was incredible!"}
{"text":"Absolutely a fantastic meal and what a view.  We spent a little over two hours at this restaurant the company was good the food and drinks were delicious.  I am such a fan now. The different guac's were very tasty as all the food we had.  The margarita flights with pick your own rim flavor were amazing.  We had such a great dinner here."}
{"text":"Such a good spot! I've been a patron at Nuevo for a little over a year now, and I tell you I just can't get enough! Each time I go in, I'm greeted with a smile, I have a knowledgeable server, and everyone I interact with is simply lovely. Regular recommendation: You MUST get the habanero jelly guacamole. Also, they serve the best margaritas in Cleveland. This isn't your typical sour mix and tequila, headache inducing mess.. this is truly a handcrafted, fresh cocktail. the structure of this place itself is enough to bring you in, but the experience is what sells it. Five stars!"}
{"text":"Want to update my review to reflect that I posted a similar review on Facebook and this establishment responded by posting a message that personally attacked me. Don't waste your money!"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos right next to the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame and the Lake Erie shore.You cannot beat the location!  You can have your tacos any way you like them. The portions are very generous. Delicious tortillas. I really like the pickled onions too. 

They also have many excellent beers on draft and they rotate them through so you always have something new. The place is known for its tequila selection.  I did not check that out in the middle of a Monday. 

This is my go to spot whenever I visit downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"This is the first review I've ever written on yelp. I am doing this so others don't waste their $ on a disappointing meal. For $0 you can walk around Voinovich Park, enjoy the view, then go to a restaurant that uses salt and serves edible food. I went with a group of 5 and we expected a wait which they estimated was an hour. We weren't notified our table was ready and had someone from our party go to the hostess stand after about an hour and fifteen minutes. They managed to put together a 5 top for us.  The margs were ok, guac needed salt and was blah, salsas were blah, and entrees were worse. My husband sent back my dish (the mahi-mahi smelled fishy). The rest of the entrees our party had were unmemorable.  The only redeeming aspects of the experience were the views and our waitress. I've heard mixed reviews and was hoping it'd be a good experience, but it wasn't."}
{"text":"Dinner for 8 and we waited an entire hour for our entrees. The apps were good. My friends husband was served and avocado that had turned.  The drinks were terrible. 2 drinks with olive oil on top were sent back. I know it's a holiday but hey ran out of beans. Beans... Our bill was over $400."}
{"text":"Food was cold and bland...drinks were good...overall there are much better Mexican restaurants in Cleveland...."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner at Nuevo. I had several draft dogfish head flesh and blood IPAs. We sat facing the lake. What a great time of year I be on the water. I started with their house Guac and Had the Cuban. Bacon, pork loin, jalapeño mustard, pickles and manchego cheese. I also had a side of rice and beans. The food and service were great. 

I have been to the Akron location as well but the view in the cle location can't be topped. 

Great people and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Margaritas were amazing. Food, although interesting menu items, was delicious.  Service left a little to be desired. But I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great spot for happy hour after touring the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame!! PS best margarita I have ever had - try the Blackberry! Not too sweet or too weak! Super refreshing"}
{"text":"Bland food that was too expensive.  Small portion sizes.  Bland chips. No salt on tables.  Had to pay for salsa.  I do not recommend this restaurant.  Do not come here!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for coffee and pastry before our cruise on the Goodtime III over the Memorial Day holiday.  The hostess station seemed chaotic even at 10:30 on a Sunday morning.  The coffee was very good (quality brew) & the pastries fresh.  Snarky waitress, but I overlooked that considering her place on the food chain.

After the cruise, 7 of us foodies returned for dinner.  The drinks were very good - Sangria just so nice!  The food, however, barely edible.  Not 1 of the 7 of us enjoyed what we ordered -- rice bland, beans - meh, and the entrees were smothered in some concoction of a hot spice.

Unfortunately, the taste of the ingredients in each of our dishes (shrimp, pork, etc.) was over-powered by the awful hot spice.

We won't be back - maybe for drinks, but not to eat.  And, yes we have eaten nuevo Tex-Mex in Southwetern states, in Mexico, and outside of CLE - no comparison,

5 stars for ambience & location.
Rocks for wait staff and Hostess station"}
{"text":"My five star rating was TOTALLY for our server Brad! He was awesome. It was our first time and he was very thorough going thru the menu. He even recommended his Fav items and they were good options..our food although came out cold the owner came and took care of everything which further made out experience awesome. I appreciate great service and because of that I will be back. Thanks Brad!!!!!"}
{"text":"We had the empanada for an appetizer. They were good but not great. The quesadilla was good. I had the scallops with a corn cake and mushroom and pepper garnish. The scallops were seared nice and tasted good but they were expensive at $24. Nice location but I won't rush back."}
{"text":"Holy Crap!!!  This was the worst food I've ever eaten and use to eat my boogers as a kid.  My son went with us.  He felt like he wanted to lay down after his meal. We went for a walk around outside after our \" meal\" because of the i seasonable weather.  When we got back to the car my son wasn't there.  This was the text I got"}
{"text":"I really want to love this place!  The location is fantastic and the food is decent.  Please Mr. Hirt, fix our beloved establishment.  It's is a holiday weekend with the Cleveland National Air Show in town.  The people are swarming this restaurant.  At least ten times, we've heard from the bartenders, they were out of a mixer.  Also, upon our seating, we were told that they are NOT making non-margarita cocktails, today.  ON A HOLIDAY WEEKEND?!  It's 2pm and they have only eight Bloody Mary's remaining.  Their brunch (a Bloody Mary rich meal) lists 11am-4pm.  I'm confused!   Also, the place could use a serious cleaning.  A meticulous restaurant manager on premise is the least this place needs.  Help!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing, are server knows everything about drinks to each dish on the menu. Glad we decided to make this the last restaurant of our trip."}
{"text":"The food taste like cardboard the chips needs salt!!!  And had to pay for chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant who does that????  I thought chip and salsa was like dinner rolls as in complimentary!  I won't be back and the service wasn't good either!"}
{"text":"Pros: Great location and modern decor! I brought my mom here for her birthday and they have gave her a free dessert.

Cons: we got here at 5 (way before busy dinner crowd) and our food took 45 minutes to come out. The rice wasn't cooked thoroughly and very hard and inedible. I got the burrito because it was vegetarian but it was definitely lacking flavor. My mom and niece had similar comments about their meals as well. My mom chose the chocoflan as her birthday dessert as they were out of the churro cupcake which is what she originally wanted. The cake was hard and the flan was so so.

It's cool for the view but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here for overpriced mediocre food."}
{"text":"An old friend was visiting from out of town and mentioned Mexican for dinner. I instantly thought of this place. Been wanting to try it, and thought it would make a nice experience for someone from out of town, to see a bit of the city while dinning. So, we went. On a Thursday, dinner time, walked right in, sat down no wait. 

Nice appeal to the eye all around. We thought we're hungry, Mexican, chips and salsa when you sit! Not so much here...Our waiter, Steven was excellent. He was a little shy when I asked where the chips and salsa were and he coyly said it's $2.00....LOL are you kidding me? Bring em out. But, honestly this was off-putting. How in-expensive is it for the restaurant to put out chips and salsa?! Which is expected, standard at least (I thought) at a Mexican joint. We had to pay for parking, that's the least they could do! The salsa was good though. If you're looking for a stiff drink, you won't be disappointed in the Margarita. 

The food: was decent. The pinto beans had some weird, wine flavor that we didn't like. The black beans were better. The carnitas taco was good, and rice ok. The quesadilla with bacon jam was great, the favorite thing we ordered, UNTIL the second to last slice was cut into and from inside came a HUGE  piece of plastic packaging....the service quickly came over and took the plate and the Manager came over to offer another or dessert. They comped the tainted meal, thanks. We ordered a chocolate cake with a white spongy/gelatin on top ( I can't remember what it was). She enjoyed it more than me. Over all based on my one experience, I would not go back and would unfortunately not recommend it to my visiting out of towners."}
{"text":"Let's start with how excited me and my friends were to eat here. The atmosphere of this restaurant is awesome. Outdoor seating in a nice area by water and a good menu. I can say some cons about how long it took to have our order taken or that the drinks we ordered were not correct but I don't care about that, those things happen. But the way the servers treated us made this whole experience a terrible one.  Any question we asked was a waste of time, our server would roll his eyes and huff in puff with any thing we asked for and overall made each one of very uncomfortable. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"The ambience was wonderful, but unfortunately the food wasn't quite what I expected. I'd have given it 2 stars if my guest's conversation hadn't made it a phenomenal evening. The wait staff wasn't the best, but he was very knowledgeable of the menu. All-in-all you'll have a better experience going to El Jalapeño's on West 117th!"}
{"text":"If I could use negative stars this place would not even rate that.  I did not know that crap was a seasoning, they must have used a lot on the food!  Because it was extra crapy.  

Do not even come here if you love your family or Mexican Food.  

The food was cold, the rice tasted like the beans which tasted like the cold coke-cola beef tacos.  I asked for corn tortillas and received flour.  Then I received the corn tortillas and they were steamed to make up for the lost time because they gave me flour tortillas.  I could only last a few bites of the meal because I could not handle the extra seasoning of crapy on it.  I was asked if I would like to have a box to bring it home.  I said No thank you then stared to laugh.  

The picture that I posted shows how much of the meal I ate.  Okay, not ate but choked down to the best of my ability.  I truly have had better Mexican tasting food in a MRE \"Meal-Ready to Eat\" which is what they give to the Military when deployed or in the field.  My Civilian buddies have a hard time choking that down.  Now you see the relevance.  

The waiter did not tell me his name.  He's a red headed dude.  Not very engaging. Now I know why."}
{"text":"Went with my girlfriend about a week ago after going to the Rock Hall and had one of our best happy hour experiences to day, actually. We had to wait a little bit for a spot to open up at the bar (the only place happy hour occurs) but once we did, man oh man, the experience never stopped getting better. 

First off: easily one of the best margaritas I've had in Cleveland. The fresh lime juice goes a long way. And for $4, hell I'll have two. We got some appetizers from happy hour menu, the guacamole (delicious and only $2.50), the calamari (also, DELICIOUS, so tender and perfectly crispy) and a plate of arepas which is made with beef cheek, came with pineapple and zucchini shavings and sat on top little cornbread cakes. NOTHING about this dish is disappointing. So so so good.

Other than that, the service was great and playful with the bartenders interacting with the happy hour crowd as if we were all friends from high school. Had a fun and short conversation with one of them about mezcal and he gave me a taste of his favorite and showed me their mezcal flight options which I can't wait to go try.

All in all, amazing experience and I can't wait to go back. One of the best happy hours I've seen anywhere. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"I was there the past Sat noon. We two ordered a drink, a app and two entry. I remember clearly I only end up with tips around $90. I checked my credit card today. I was charged $100. This is the first time I encountered this situation. I don't know how a restaurant could do this!!!!! I didn't keep the receipt. Because I never thought about that the restaurant would do this. I am so angry! check your credit card!!! I did get a refund after I called them. They said the handwriting is hard to read. Okay. 90 vs 100 is really hard to distinguish. Anyway, I get my money back."}
{"text":"A group of 6 of us drove out to Nuevo for their happy hour after my roommate had a positive experience with their other location while she was attending Kent. The happy hour deals only apply if you're sitting at the bar FYI and we almost had to move from our table to the bar but they ended up letting us stay. 

The happy hour deals are quite good. The margaritas are very tasty and will only set you back $4 a piece. They're served in a highball glass and come with an impressive amount of rim options like smoked salt and citrus peel. They have some fun offerings like spicy mango, apricot, and cilantro jalapeño. I liked all of the ones I tried which was damn near every option. We also got the salsa trio of which the verde was by far the most notable- even though that's usually my least favorite. The guacamole is also a good deal I believe it was only $2.50! 

As for actual food the happy hour list isn't extensive so we also ordered quesadillas. I've never met a quesadilla I didn't like until Nuevo. I had some of the chicken and some of the chorizo and I ended up taking them home. I took them to work only to throw them away (which I never ever do) after trying them again because they just weren't good. The rice and beans were super dry and the whole meal was just disappointing. 

Also- the parking situation sucks. If you park at Voinovich park expect to pay $8 for 1-2 hours. Usually places like this give you some sort of voucher or something but nope not here. 

It's a gorgeous location and beautifully designed. Happy hour is decent but I'd stay away from the normal menu. I think I'll return in the summer for happy hour if I'm already in the area."}
{"text":"SAD! Worst meal ever . Read to the end if u want to be really shocked . First off , its SAD! Bc the location is so nice. The meal started off with getting water with no ice. Then the waiter took our drink order came back 10 minutes later and said can I take your drink order? We said we already put it in. He said with who? In shock we said \"you\". My guess was he was on drugs or hungover. From there the slowest service ever took place for the next hour of hell we spent dining there. To end the meal as I ate my quesadilla I found a nice CURLY BLACK HAIR in my quesadilla. It looked like a pube. I didn't start vimmotting Bc I guess I was pry too mad to even be nauseous. Then never got our waters filled once more before they meal was over. One glass of warm water with no ice on a 70 degree day and a pube filled quessadilla . Hope changes are made Bc the surrounding area is cool but that restaraunt was the absolute pits."}
{"text":"Meh. No reason to rush down when there are plenty of other better \"Mexican\" places in the burbs. The atmosphere is just missing something. Maybe it was the music that was a 50's swing feel on a Saturday night in a mod mex restaurant. Decor and music definitely don't match menu and theme. Not happy about paying $10 for chips and salsa. Nothing special. Ordered queso fundido and expected a more flavorful, thicker dish to wrap in a tortilla, as opposed to just dipping some chips. Margherita was extremely weak, and when we ordered an extra shot to add to our drink, the barely 1 oz. we got explained it all. Other than the chicken creama which came with two nice sized breasts, the rest of our meals were very small and underwhelming. Lamb tacos said it was served with pickled vegetables. They weren't pickled and the lamb was cold and fatty. The rice was dry and flavorless. It wasn't crowded, so I'm not sure why the kitchen couldn't have taken its time to make a better meal for the prices they charge. With so many choices, you just can't serve average"}
{"text":"Despite the valiant efforts of an effusively apologetic waiter to diffuse the simmering tensions amongst this over-heated reviewer and his dining companions, the simple fact remains that the Nuevo experience is nothing short of an unmitigated disaster. The vast majority of the outdoor seating is unshielded from the sun so apply SPF 5,000 before arriving (or better yet, make reservations far in advance to secure an indoor table). The wait time was an excruciating and absurd hour and fifteen minutes, though, as mentioned, the waiter did his best to smooth things over, and would have been successful had the food been anything to write home about. As it stands, his efforts were largely in vain. The Nuevo tofu quesadilla was comprised of a scant onion/pepper medley, a paper thin tortilla, several lifeless slabs of tofu, and a river of grease which dwarfed the Cuyahoga. The accompanying beans and rice were achingly substandard, seemingly not seasoned whatsoever. To Nuevo's credit, the guacamole was outstanding, a perfect amalgam of savory-rich and salty. And the restaurant's location is admittedly a major selling point with a picturesque view of the lake and surrounding green space. There is also a sand volleyball court looming just beyond the wraparound patio, though it was apparently abandoned on Friday afternoon. Your reviewer's interest was piqued by the drink menu and a return journey will be in order to sample the horchata/bourbon cocktail and the pain-killer, so expect this review to be updated (and the rating quite possibly improved), as it stands now, however, Nuevo seems to be sinking fast...despite being located safe from the waves within the marina."}
{"text":"My star system:  Three if I'd go back, four  if I'd go out of my way, five if I wanted to be a regular.    Good food if a bit pricey, but hey, you are paying for the location.  Nice spot to eat lunch if you are visiting the Rock Hall of  Fame.  Staff knows what they are doing and can help you with choosing dishes."}
{"text":"Restaurant was ill-equipped to conduct business today in the midst of the Latino Festival at Voinovich Park.  I had the pork al pastor which was water-logged and flavorless.  The black beans had no seasoning; tasted like they just opened a can of beans.  When it came to dessert, we were told they only had one, a churro cupcake cause the kitchen was nervous about the crowd. Really???? The bill for 3 of us, no drinks or appetizers was nearly $50.  What a waste of money.  Not going back, plus we had to pay $10 to park."}
{"text":"The food was not anything to write home about. I ordered the Chicken Al Pastor, husband ordered the queso, and my son got a cheese quesadilla. I gave two stars for the positives!

Positives- 
Nice location, right on the water. We stumbled onto the Air Show 2016 and it was a perfect location. Beautiful.

Server- our server was very nice! The guy who was refilling our waters was really nice too!

Negatives- 

menu is way too complex. They were only serving dinner at 11am (because of air show). Server admitted it was a last minute decision by management. I watched endless people come in and look at the menu and leave. Y'all could have made a lot of money off of those people.

Food- 
Queso- weird cheese boils with blue chips. My husband liked it.

Cheese Quesadilla- came with a house blend cheese quesadilla, side of rice, and potato wedge type potato. Three bites.

Chicken Al Pastor- the chicken was very dry. Even though it was in liquid, it was dry. Everything on the menu spewed fresh and uniqueness. I honestly felt like I was eating store bought seasoned chicken. There was seasoned rice and beans as sides. The rice tasted like rice-a-roni Spanish rice. The beans were okay."}
{"text":"We almost decided against this restaurant due to the reviews, but we were so glad we didn't!  The salsa, guacamole, and queso were delicious!  Everyone in our group had a great time and enjoyed our entrees as well (get the polenta)! We will definitely consider returning on our next trip to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Drinks & atmosphere were awesome as most other reviews state. The lack of stars is due to the lackluster Mexican food: pollo crema was basically strong goat cheese sauce on top of extra dry grilled chicken with undercooked rice, the burrito was a handful of raw spinach or lettuce wrapped in a flour tortilla, the queso could have been melted down cheese spray, and the $30 hanger steak was chewy and boring. Although I'd return for drinks with friends, I would never come back for food due to the lack of flavor and poor execution as well as the fact that it took 40+ minutes to get the food we wished we never ordered."}
{"text":"At least the waiter was nice. Really didn't enough the food at all. Ordered the mani tacos al pastor and I almost couldn't eat them. Completely flavorless and smelled fishy. You had to make your own taco which is fine except it wasn't good food."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try Nuevo since it opened.  We arrived on a Friday early evening to find that there were no tables available, only bar seating which we were fine with. Once seated at the bar we were told beware you are on the splash zone, and splashed we got. We decided to order margaritas which were delicious and apps which were very disappointing. We had guacamole ,salsa and chips....the salsa was spoiled, guacamole had a half an avacodo untouched and the chips were store bought. Also ordered the salmon ceviche and the minute they brought it out there was a strong fish odor....yuck! No citrus was involved in this app. Inedible.  Service, view and drinks were great.....food.....don't eat it! Lastly, for the money we spent...total disappoint."}
{"text":"Super location, practically on the lake!  It's also a stone's throw from the Rock and Roll Museum. 

I came for happy hour and enjoyed an IPA beer with some tequila shrimp. 

The restaurant looked great. Very clean and new. The bartender was nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Less than impressed with their parking situation; if you want the business (which would, quite frankly) be more than the $35 it costs to park, you should buy out the lot that the city runs on tavos. I'll get mediocre tacos and tequila somewhere else ?"}
{"text":"The location is in a beautiful place downtown on Lake Erie, but the food was horrible!!!  Absolutely flavourless...no salt nor any other seasoning at all. Then I noticed that on all the tables there were not any salt nor pepper shakers.  I had to ask for salt.  The salsa was stewed tomatoes and that was it...again, made without salt nor seasoning.  The only way that this restaurant is still in existence is because of its location on the water and being next door to the Rock N Roll Hall of Fame."}
{"text":"Very expensive for lunch on the weekends. You only get the dinner menu. Food was horrible. Guacamole not very good and the salsa was out of a jar. Got the steak, very, very raw.  Beans and rice were nothing special. Will not return that is for sure. Drinks very high priced and tasted very sugary and pre made."}
{"text":"View, vibe and location all get five stars, but
Based on food reviews by myself and my 7 coworkers just average at best.
We had a guacamole flight, just ho-hum . The queso was yummy.
No one was raving about the food.
I'd rate food more of 3 stars but gave a 
Four star rating based on more of the atmosphere."}
{"text":"I didn't even know this place was here until I went to Voinovich Park for my engagement pics and we stopped here for dinner afterward. We sat at the bar, which has bar stools that have backs that only go up too the small of your back, so they aren't very comfortable. The have different flavor margaritas that you can get, and what's cool is the have different rim flavors. The restaurant is decorated nicely and they have what looks like a nice patio. 

The margs tasted like they had no alcohol in them. Flavor in was good, but I was questioning if there was actually any tequila in it. I ordered the pollo crema. The chicken was so dry, but the sauce on it was really super good. Beans and rice were also dry and had no flavor...a little salt and pepper go a long way. 

We also ordered a salsa trio, which the salsa literally tasted like it came from a jar. 

Took us almost an hour to get our food. The price for what we got...not worth it. There are way better restaurants around for less money."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and their empanadas were amazing. I got the carne asada was good but I would say the empanada was probably the best part."}
{"text":"Ran into this when we were checking out the waterfront of Cleveland for the first time (we are from Maryland). Our server Ian took great care of us. My wife got the tamales (they are vegan) and I got the tacos. My son got the cheese quesadilla. The food was well put together and delicious (the tamales have a bit of a spicy kick to them) and aside from being exposed to non patrons trying to \"sell pies\" the atmosphere was great. Ian took great care of us and we will return if/when we come back to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Best margarita I've had in a while! Black cherry on the rocks with a sugared rim. And my arugula malanga burrito with side of rice and beans was super. (Leftovers were great for breakfast the next morning). 

Chips brought to table were lightly spiced and really tasty, especially with the guacamole. I definitely want to go back during nicer weather, although I imagine it will be much busier in the summer months."}
{"text":"Went to this prime location restaurant this evening. Showed up 5 minutes early for reservation. Front desk staff was plain awful. Took 10 minutes to get us checked in. Seated at a table, dirty chairs and food remnants on the window next to the table. Someone came over to take our drink order quickly.  Ordered a couple of margaritas: they were AWFUL! I'm not sure how you can call yourself a Mexican joint and not make a decent margarita?!  Ordered guacamole and queso to start. The guacamole came browned on the outside and plopped in a dish with an ice cream scoop. Thankfully good flavor, it sure didn't look appealing. Queso: save your money. It was terrible. The consistency was watery, yet gritty. Strange texture for queso. Dinner was carne asada and carnitas. Both were okay (nothing to be excited about). Pinto beans had interesting, but good flavor. Enjoyed the Mexican rice, just wish it had more kick. Dessert: flight of reposado tequilas. Not the best tequilas, but not the restaurants fault. 
Server was polite despite my mother's insistence that the food just wasn't up to snuff. She was the only thing bringing rating to 2-stars. 
Definitely would NOT eat here again."}
{"text":"Food was sub-par, prices too high (along with high parking charge), but worst of all, the service was terrible. Our server aggressively kept trying to up-sell us in a way I have never experienced at a restaurant before. I imagine he was trying to increase the bill to increase his tip. He also brought us items we didn't ask for, making us believe that they were complimentary, but charged us after the fact. He was just sketchy all around. He also refused my request for my salmon to be cooked to a medium temperature, indicating that it would anger the chef and that it couldn't be done. With all of these factors combined, we definitely don't plan to return.

CAUTION: Two nights after dining here, we discovered fraudulent activity on the credit card we used here. While we can't be sure of how/where our information was compromised, we are highly suspicious that there's a connection here."}
{"text":"Really fresh and good.  Service is good.  The menu is creative but not so weird that you are hesitant to make a selection.  I had the carnitas on my first visit and beef short ribs the next visit.  Both were fork tender and flavorful.  Guacamole is really yummy.  Eclectic selection of margaritas, too.

Right on the lake and close to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, so the views are amazing."}
{"text":"Food was great. Didn't have to wait long. A little  pricey, but worth it. Staff was very nice. View from the patio was very nice."}
{"text":"Heard about Nuevo modern a few weeks ago and was dying to try it out!! Last Sunday we finally made the trip downtown and the group of us were absolutely delighted.. the food, drinks, service, and atmosphere was amazing!! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"New.  Mexican.  Great view and internal ambiance with nice location on the lake. I'm sure the start up for this place was a fortune    Food was decent.... we ordered the cheese fundido with chorizo and the catfish wrap   Service however was fair at best.  Hop, skip & a jump from the Rock &Roll Hall of Hame. Had to ask for chips 20 minutes after ordering my meal at the bar.  Let me repeat that... We had to ASK for tortilla chips at a Mexican restaurant. And it seemed to be a surprise that we were asking to the fella behind the bar. Strike one.  2 separate communication issues with the same forgetful bartender, who may possibly have been a bar manager as well.  Strike two   A very sweet female bartender had to make up for this guys shortcomings on a couple of occasions. It turned into a stressful lunch unnecessarily. Based on that, my recommendation is for you to walk a little further and go elsewhere.  Bar staff was very involved in a lot of technical stuff behind the bar while forgetting to take care of the reason that they are there... Us.  Keep it simple. Occasionally make eye contact with your customers and you will know when to respond and will do fine. Strike three will be if they ever have a customer have a similar experience.  


Nuevo Investors and general management, take note of your employees who look busy versus your employees who are busy. That is your hard earned money at stake there."}
{"text":"This place is a bit pricey when it comes to Mexican but you're paying for the scene. The location is perfect and it was super packed the night we went. The food wasn't very memorable as it was just shrimp not very flavorful but the drinks made up for it. The staff were polite and the decor is awesome."}
{"text":"Love love this place. Nick and Eric were awesome bartenders. Learned a lot about tequila as they shared their knowledge.  Fun time at a fun place."}
{"text":"This was surprisingly incredible. I was hesitant after reading reviews here that said to only go for apps, but I got main courses and was amazed. The appetizers are so good; we got the guacamole with pepper jam and the meatballs. The guac was the best part of the whole meal. I would go back there just to eat the pepper jam. For the main course I got the duck and LOVED it. It had a sweet, tangy sauce with buttery broccolini, and tender meat. The skin was very tough to eat, but besides that it was a beautiful meal with lots of balance. The thing I most pride this restaurant on is how interesting the menu is. Nothing seems like they didn't take hours and hours figuring it out. Amazing place!"}
{"text":"The view and atmosphere are amazing. The drinks were SOOOO good. The food.... yikes. Literally my food tasted and smelled like wet dog food. (i know harsh but thats exactly what it reminded me of. The guac was great with the chips. I would come here again for drinks and dips only. Not for dinner. Probably won't be back for a while tho."}
{"text":"The location, view, and ambiance of this place is great. The food and service however, is not! The food is very over priced and not worth it. There are many other much better places to go downtown!"}
{"text":"Pros: the VIEW!!! The drinks, volleyball courts, decor, layout, wait staff, authentic and classic Mexican dishes with a modern twist.

Cons: bland food, the usual startup hiccups (slow service), bartenders that can't tell the difference between vodka and tequila, and parking (unless you're docking your boat right there).

All in all - we checked out Nuevo last Friday for a friend's birthday dinner. Walking up, it was packed, patio was full, and it just looked super inviting. We were seated immediately outside. If you're going to sit on the patio, ask for the upstairs... your view is going to be amazing. As I mentioned in the pros, the food was good for the most part. Nothing to write home about, but definitely wouldn't keep me from going. I do expect this menu to change quite a bit as they get their shit together, but it's not bad. We had the guac, queso fundido with chorizo, ceviche (a different, creamy type, with coconut milk I believe), the calamari, and the salsa trio as an appetizer, and all were pretty damn good. The entrees were nothing special though. I had the pollo crema and tried the tacos al pastor from a friend - they were okay. Nothing spectacular, but also nothing that would keep me from going back.

Drinks were amazing. We tried several of the Margaritas Flights... they come in 8 or so different flavors. You pick 3 and they're served on these cute little 1x5 boards and they're actually a decent size. They were amazing until the server brought out 2 margaritas on one of the Flights, and a full glass of Tito's vodka in the other. He explained that the bartending staff ran out of the margarita I wanted, so they gave me Tito's vodka instead. LOL! They didn't bother letting me know before they brought it out, though. The server expressed a little anger over the bartending staff. I asked to speak to the manager. Some guy came out, said he wasn't the actual manager, but an assistant. He was really nice and apologized, and they brought out a new margarita. For that view and ambiance, I'd go back any day!"}
{"text":"Had lunch at Nuevo yesterday with my coworkers. We planned the luncheon in advance and made a reservation. We were seated and served water. Our waitress was friendly and the service was very good.

We submitted our orders and the food was out relatively quickly, given we were 10. I really wanted to taste everything, but I ordered the Cuban sandwich, which looked great in pictures. Fortunately, it tasted as great as it looked. With two or three kinds of pork on it, including bacon, the sandwich was high quality and delicious. My green beans were crispy, delicious, and excellent overall. I really enjoyed my $19 lunch! I'd visit again to try some tacos, but this place won't last long with these prices. How do they not know that?  How do they not adjust to market trends and demands? Maybe this review will signal that offering cheap lunch options is critical to a restaurant's survival in this metropolitan area.

Food was good. Prices were high. Service was great."}
{"text":"I work very close to this building and I was very excited to have something within walking distance and such a pretty view. Actual food and drink were just so so.

I will give kudos to the location and the service. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and friendly and the location is a gorgeous view of the lake. 

I ordered the cucumber guac and we got some chips and salsa while my friend ordered the plaintains.The salsa was pretty good while the guac and fried plaintains were just ok. I thought everything was kind of bland.

I was not impressed with my margarita. It was extremely sweet and seemed like it had little tequila in it. Maybe its just me though. I do enjoy more of a sour limey margarita. My friend did enjoy her blood orange one. 

Price was pretty good. Happy Hour offers 2 dollars off Margaritas until 6."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch after visiting the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Don't let the nice modern decor fool you, this place has mediocre food with slow/bad service, and a dirty dining experience.  Sure seems like it lacks the care and quality service.  The restaurant was 2/3 empty yet it took the hostess 10 minutes to sit us...then the waitress screwed up our order.  All of that - for average food.

Another great example of following the yelp reviews - this place lived up to the consistent poor reviews."}
{"text":"This review has nothing to do with the food and everything to do with the staff! The food is good. Not great but good. We were there with a party of six and stopped in for a drink before we were to board the Goodtime for the air show. It was Labor day weekend so we knew we might be in for a wait. To my surprise, it wasn't that busy, the bar stools were filled but many open tables they could have seated us at, but they said it was a 1 1/2 hour wait. We elected to stand at the bar and get a drink. After 15 min of no help, a waitress asked if she could take our order. Places the order and waited 15 min more before drinks. We don't wait that long at packed clubs! Stopped back again after air show to eat. Could not service a party of 6 inside even with open tables everywhere, but they could outside with an hour wait! Really? Tables freakin everywhere! We wait. We order. Wait some more. 30 min for food to show. I may try them again later after the staff gets it together but be prepared to wait and wait and wait. Unless theres two of you. You might do better then."}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday afternoon with my coworkers since we heard of the new Cleveland location opening up. Boy did we make a mistake of patronizing this place. The only redeeming qualities were the scenery and the nice waiter we had. It was beautifully decorated in a modern theme and the lakeside view was just breathtaking. That's where my enjoyment ends. The rest of this place is a total joke! Service was at a snail's pace unless you were at the bar chugging beers, it's a wonder that your food is still hot when you get it. Seriously, I could have gone gray by the time we got our food. On the subject of food, don't bother coming here unless you take out a second mortgage. The menu is so laughably tiny and limited, but the prices clearly show that it's compensating for something. The cheapest meal on the menu is $12, and this was their lunch menu! If you're not well versed in semi-upscale Mexican cuisine, you're going to have a hard time knowing what to order. The tacos and quesadillas were loaded with beans and other garbage I personally wasn't fond of, but my coworker seemed to enjoy it and was even big enough for her to take home leftovers. Not so in my \"lunch,\" which was the pollo crema. I had to keep from laughing aloud at just how puny the chicken breast was. I think the chicken sandwiches you get at McDonald's give you bigger chicken breasts, and for half the price! For however small it was, I will admit that it was very tasty and the melted goat cheese blended in jalapenos was a nice complement. The meal also came with Spanish rice and beans, but since I don't like beans I just got double rice. The rice was passable, but edible. I saw the regular sized portions of rice and beans on my coworkers' plates and I wasn't impressed. At the end of the meal, I left still hungry and with a lighter wallet. If starving your customers while simultaneously raking them over the coals and ignoring them unless they're getting drunk off their ass is the \"new Mexican cuisine\" way, then I'll stick with my Mom and Pop Mexican joint and Taco Bell."}
{"text":"I came here today with my sister and a friend. We sat outside and only ordered drinks, so this is bar and ambiance related only. 

(Tip: Parking is easy, pay at the stands marked P, just remember your license plate number!)

It was a nice overcast, breezy day. Sitting on their lovely patio was so relaxing. They have so many options of seating outside! Love seats, individual seats, futon type seating, an outdoor bar, and more. You have a lovely view of Erie and the path for the park is visible. 

We were greeted by friendly faces and all of our interactions with staff were genuinely pleasant from start to finish. Their drink options are plentiful. Tequila flights, beer, margaritas, piña coladas, etc. My sister and I had the margarita flight (one each, had to get as many flavors as we could haha)...and oh sweet heavens above--were they good. You can choose your flavor and your rim. They do not mess with you when you sit in the lounge seating and are ordering from the bar only. You can sit there as long as you like. We probably sat here-- all conversing, drinking, and enjoying each other's company-- for at least two hours. 

The facilities are spotlessly clean, the interior of the restaurant is sleekly modern design fused with traditional Mexican design. The parking is easy, the staff is friendly, the drinks and view are outstanding. I will return for food and of course drinks. I am just so happy with Nuevo!!!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the absolute best locations along the lake in Cleveland is completely undermined by both extremely poor service/training and unacceptable food. We ate there over the weekend and after we sat down we waited 20 minutes on a slow night to have drink service at our table. We had to ask the server who was clearly very untrained or unmotivated if they allowed drinks with dinner as she never asked us for a drink order which is typically one of the very first things done when dining after greeting the table. The actual dinner took about 40 minutes for our \"upscale\" Mexican meals to arrive. She never came to see if another drink was needed. The owners should be present to see what a mess this place is. Hopefully once they go out of business a much better destination restaurant will take this space over. None of us in our group would ever think of returning."}
{"text":"Food was....ok. Not great for the price. My girlfriend's food never came and we had to leave. They also tried to charge us for a meal that we didn't order. It other words, I got a $71 dollar tab for a beer and some tacos.....avoid this place."}
{"text":"Excellent service, food was pretty good, looooooved the prickly pear margarita, and the quinoa chorizo burrito was so spicy and delicious. Views also help make this an incredible spot."}
{"text":"Stopped in after wandering around the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.  Reviews were mostly good, it was within easy walking distance, and it was starting to snow/sleet.
The place had a nice look to it.  Would have looked even better if the windchill hadn't been zero. 
Warmed up with a Spicy Mango Margarita, had the Tequila Roasted Shrimp Camerones appetizer to complement that.
The staff at the bar was helpful and friendly.
The Margarita had a nice taste and bite to it.
The Camerones were exquisite.  The shrimp juicy, tender and hot.  All the spicy things with them gave them just the perfect taste.
Would love to come here when you could sit outside and enjoy the lake."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican in a good location. The atmosphere is open and inviting."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if we came at a bad time. But our waiter took a really long time to come to our table. There were some staff just standing around. 

There was a staff meeting or something where they were trying a pink drink together. Maybe they were getting ready for dinner service? I'm not sure but if you plan on doing that, should there still be some staff working and taking tables? 

When the waiter finally came, he was very friendly and welcome us to the city. It was our first time there in Cleveland. 

We order drinks and the salmon ceviche and it was presented very lovely. The decor is very new. I think this place is trendy and has very open windows to see the water. 

Other than that, this place was decent for being on the pier."}
{"text":"Food is really underwhelming.  Pretty sure the house salsa was just a bowl of canned tomatoes.  Commenting on margaritas or guacamole is asinine.  Downstairs atmosphere is cold, like a hotel lobby.  Didn't check out the upstairs.  So much potential, but it could use a good decorator and a creative chef."}
{"text":"Starting off with a Spicy Mango margarita was a good idea. The waiter suggested a chili salt rim that went nicely with the spice in the drink. You can get a flight of 3, 8oz margaritas for $15 or one for $8. 

I tried a guac for a starter. It came with a massive amount of chips, which were just basic. The guac was good; nice texture. I tried the Pickled Peaches, Goat Cheese and Hazelnut version, a $1 up charge for the extras. The flavor was good, but not a lot of the extras were provided and I'm not sure how noticeable their flavor was. The waiter recommended next time I try his favorite, the Habanero Jelly variety. 

For my main I was served a large portion. I got the verde chorizo burrito. This came with a nice mix of flavors of fig, onion, apple and chickpeas. This was blended together with a walnut cream sauce and made for a big stuffed burrito. The dish came with a side of rice and a choice of side. The wording on the entree section of the menu only offers a choice of two types of beans as a side, but the waiter offered any side we wanted. 

The dessert menu offered Vegan ice cream as an option. I recognized the flavor as one served at Mitchell's so it is my guess that that is the source of the ice cream. 

Overall a nice evening. Our server was vey attentive and provided service that exceeded my expectations for a place like Nuevo."}
{"text":"We dined there but while the server, Justin, was cordial he kept us waiting a long time when it came time to pay and then he did not present an itemized bill which he should. Later, I pointed this out but he didn't seem to know how to get one quickly. I tried to get one later but they failed. They have been open a month so these sorts of problems should not be happening. Maybe wait 6 more months before u try them. Food was so-so. Portions were small considering this was Mexican food. Rice was undercooked and crunchy. Meh.
I raised my review to 2 stars because Joe, the manager, sent me the bill after I spoke with him the next day. But, sadly, the food is bland still and proportions small. Texas and California serve it more true to form."}
{"text":"Our service was terribly slow. I had to ask three times for a soft drink. Our server was in training, but he didn't appear to be all that frazzled or overwhelmed, so I'm not sure why he seemed incapable of bringing my beverage. As for the fact that we waited an eternity for our app and entrees, a backup in the kitchen was apparently to blame. This all would've been easier to overlook if the food had turned out excellent, but that was not the case. The salsas and guac were tasty, but the chips weren't much better than the bagged variety heated up in a microwave. Our seared tofu burritos tasted bland. The lake and city views are magnificent and the interior sleek and cool. But those are about the only reasons to go. We doubt we'll return."}
{"text":"Not as bad as I'm reading. Parking was $8.00 but close to restaurant and water.
Ordered a house margarita with salt, they were refreshing. Queso dip was great, chips needed a little bit of salt. Ordered flank steak, rice and beans...they were good but also needed a little bit of salt/flavor. Overall happy and pleased with the value. Our waiter was also responsive and provided great service. Will return again to try a chicken dish."}
{"text":"Attended a luncheon upstairs. The views of the lake and downtown were fabulous. We had a BBQ buffet with salad. The food was okay, and then without dessert, it wasn't worth $30. I don't know how that price was justified. But we wanted to try Nuevo. The main dining/bar area is open with windows. And outdoors is a volleyball court. I will come again to try the modern Mexican food and to enjoy the view. I'll bet the nighttime lights are wonderful to see."}
{"text":"Great location on the lake. Nice contemporary decor and ambiance but that's not the primary reason for coming to a restaurant.

My very simple Casa salad with Chorizo came at least 7 minutes after the rest of my group. I've had larger side salads! The ingredients were fresh and the dressing was tasty but definitely not worth $18. 

To add insult to injury, they actually charged me $1 for 4 pieces of jalapeño pepper I asked for."}
{"text":"Hellll yeah! So good. Gorgeous location, amazing building so modern and cool. Our editor was beyond nice, answered all our questions and gave us great insight into the menu. As you walk in the entrance is very \"modern Mexican\" with sugar skulls and the modern building, but I wish they incorporated more Mexican themes into the rest of the restaurant."}
{"text":"At a very classy location, near the beach. 
The food was good, drinks were great. Staff were very welcoming."}
{"text":"A new player on the dining scene here in Cleveland, Nuevo is a welcome addition to the waterfront food scene. I sat at the bar. I was greeted quickly and with courtesy. A classic house margarita was recommended. It came quickly and is very well made. Cheers! I ordered the tamale. I wasn't terribly hungry but wanted to try a house specialty. The tamale was very good. A great balance of flavors. The portion was perfect for my now rising hunger! The crowd was lunch/ business casual but I'm sure it's going to get a little looser on the weekends! I love the look, I love the energy and I love that they brought this awesome concept to Cleveland. Captain Frank would be proud!"}
{"text":"UPDATE:  The owner, Lisa Hirt in a very professional way responded to my call to her other location in Akron.  She was very surprised for what had happened and did not know how patrons have been treated in the Downtown location.  She gave us her cellphone number and offered to personally take care of us in any of her restaurants.  Thanks Lisa for being such a professional entrepreneur and wanting your business to succeed.

I have been in many restaurants around the world and have never experienced such an outrageous bad service and lack of humanity in my life.  We were in the park nearby waiting for the restaurant to open.  There were 20 min left for it to open when it started raining and I was with my 3yr old waiting outside.  I very politely asked the bartender to allow us to wait in the waiting area for us not to get wet.  The bartender, the hostess and some other \"gentleman\" in a very rude way told us to get out of the restaurant and wait 20 more minutes under the rain.  I am still amazed of what happened and can't believe people like this would work in the service industry."}
{"text":"I wouldn't call this Mexican food, so if you're in the mood for some good tacos then this is definitely not the place to go to. The food didn't have much flavor at all. I ordered the pork tacos which was some pulled pork in a dish with an apple slaw on top, you had to assemble the tacos and there was no discernible flavor to be honest. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. Didn't Taste like much of anything. My husband had the quesadillas which didn't have much of anything in there. The habanero flavor was a little too strong and was really all you tasted. We left lunch feeling more than disappointed, the higher price point also left us feeling ripped off. It's a hipster joint that didn't quite translate, and hipster food is usually pretty good."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere, fantastic drinks, especially and the waiter who had a \"Johnny Depp\" look going on! He was so nice, knowledgeable, and a great waiter! As far as the food however, it was just ok and disappointing. The scallop dish was especially way overpriced ($27). All you got were four scallops, a side of plain lettuce and side of plain chopped tomatoes. Really?? Actually there wasn't much effort going on in any of our dishes and the shrimp tacos are really shrimp fajitas. You make it yourself but other than the baby shrimp, onions, green peppers and sauce, there's a side of really dry spicey rice and a very small amount of cheese, one more side. We'd go back for drinks but unless they are stepping up their food, we won't indulge on that end. Shame too because they have so much potential."}
