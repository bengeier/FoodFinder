{"text":"We have eaten Pho all over the country and this is some of the best we have had. The summer spring rolls are amazing as well. I had the P5 combo Pho with meatballs, steak, Brisket and shank. My Bride had the P1 Steak and loved it. Crazy good. Finally some good Pho close to Queen Creek. Come try it out and invite us to come along."}
{"text":"I'm always excited to try a new restaurant that serves pho since my favorite place is no longer in business. I enjoyed the pho and appetizers but dinner was on the expensive side. The menu stated that happy hour was until 3 to 7 PM but the server told me it ended at 6 PM. The pho was good just wished there were more broth and noodles.  This place was upscale from other pho places, decorated nice and the food was presented nicely but I guess I rather have awesome food at a reasonable price. So I'm still on a search for the perfect place......"}
{"text":"I had the tofu veggie pho in beef broth with the edamame app and loved it! All the veggies were super crisp and the broth was amazing. I thought the price was slightly high at $9.95, but the portion was so large that I ended up bringing half of it home, adding some beef bone broth and made another meal out of it. The restaurant is very clean and the service was impeccable. Love that there is finally a place in east Gilbert for great pho :)"}
{"text":"OMG!! This place is super OVER PRICE. I paid almost $12 for couple slices of meat, 3 meatballs in a quarter size and vegies. They even want to charge me extra when i ask for more been sprouts. I think this is my second times also the last time here. Sorry, your food is not bad but I don't like the prices. This is definitely not worth my almost $12."}
{"text":"2 thumbs up! Went for lunch today and enjoyed calamari appetizer and pho (#4 #15). Both were delicious and the broth was amazing! Interior of the restaurant was tasteful and it was pretty busy for a Saturday lunch. We will definitely be returning. The service was a bit slow which is why I give 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"Food quality was absolutely good!! I ordered Pho Tom which is shrimp and food taste amazing!"}
{"text":"The best Pho I've had in a long time! Everything was delicious and the portions were great. I'm so glad I found this place!"}
{"text":"Really happy to have a great Vietnamese place in Gilbert/Queen Creek area. We have enjoyed it so much that we have become regulars 1-2 times a week. The owner is amazing and remembers our order ever time. The pho is fantastic and the spicy edamame is the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"This place just opened up and I am so glad to finally have a decent Vietnamese spot near by. The food was actually really good and the Phó was excellent. No more driving to Mesa or Chandler for good Vietnamese food. The price is a little on the high side but I justified it by thinking of how much gas and time I would spend driving elsewhere. Please stop by this place give it a shot. It's very nicely decorated inside and looks cleaner than any other Phò spot around."}
{"text":"This place really surprised me.  Their food is very flavorful. If you want to try food from Vietnam, please do yourself a favor and try it here. I WILL be back!"}
{"text":"The Pho here is amazing! If you like a good broth this is it. I had beef, and had them add veggies. My Husband has the chicken and added veggies. Lots of noodles. 
It is comparable in flavor to Simi's. I will for sure be back."}
{"text":"New Vietnamese place. I totally love it. I love pho. So I had a bowl of pho tai. The broth was perfect. Had all the fixins. I drank so much of the delicious broth I had plenty of noodles and veg for later. Yum. I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is really good and exactly what the East Mesa/East Gilbert area was missing.

They have lots of great pho options and the broth is very flavorful and delicious. My husband and I got the summer rolls (A2), P15 (I think), and the chicken broth pho with tofu and veggies (H5). The takeout only took 10-15 minutes, service was good, and we enjoyed every bite of our meals.

This will definitely become our regular stop for Pho!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  I am SO glad this place has opened up in our area. Pho is superb!  Great depth of flavor and loaded with your choice of meats. 

Altered the summer rolls and Imperial roll. Also excellent!  

Will be a regular for sure."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS!! I go at least twice a week as it is located down the street from my work. The owner has become familiar with my order, and I am in and out within 45 minutes! I order the A2 Spring Rolls and P12 Chicken with Beef Broth Pho. I consistently leave full and very happy! The ONLY downfall that is common with many restaurants is how I smell after I leave...not sure what can be done about that if anything so it is a very small detail. The food and service is great, though! Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"So glad there is a Vietnamese cuisine place that actually taste great!!! No need to drive to Chandler/Mesa (on Dobson where all the Asian markets and restaurants are located). My sister and I dropped in and tried their vermicelli noodles.  It was good! The portion looked small but it was so fulfilling and it you get the steak and shrimp bun they don't skimp in the quality of the steak. It tasted like butter! We also had their pho... wow great flavors and delicious! This place is my go to spot to a pho fix"}
{"text":"Super yummy pho! Had the veggie pho and it's one of the best I've had in a while definitely worth coming back to! Summer rolls were Fresh and flavorful! Service was fast and friendly"}
{"text":"Date night with my hubby. Service was great. Food was wonderful. Perfectly hit the spot."}
{"text":"Let me start with the food is amazing. So happy to see a good Vietnamese Restaurant in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  Will definitely be back.  Awesomely delicious food that has great presentation."}
{"text":"This is the best pho outside of Phoenix. 

I moved here from California and I'm glad my search for excellent pho is over. I've been here for a year now. When you're from California, pho places are plentiful -- it's really up to you to find your 'go-to'. 

I've visited this place over 5 times now and ordered the same thing each time:

PHO SA DEC. 

They named a dish after the town they're from -- Sa Dec. This bowl offers everything. It's their signature dish. I'm not sure why this menu item is not bolded and enlarged at the very front page of their menu. It's hidden amongst all the other menu items. The broth is clear and flavorful, the meat cuts (steak, brisket, meatballs) are all of high quality, and the veggies that come along with it are all super fresh and crispy. I don't think I'll order anything else. 

Side Note: Get a Vietnamese iced coffee to go along with your meal. 

All in all, I'd go as far as saying that I feel like I'm right at home when I'm having a bowl of pho here. Great hearty meal to start your day or even recover from a night out. 

Won't go anywhere else for pho!"}
{"text":"I honestly come to conclusion that folks of Gilbert do not know what good Vietnamese food is! Another new Viet spot opened up and with high hopes I was hoping it was going to be my go-to spot...but unfortunately I didn't care to much for SaDec. I ordered the pho with meatballs and beef broth was simple and the noodles reminded me more of spaghetti noodles which I didn't care for. Summer Rolls were pretty awesome though. Overall I am still on my search for great Vietnamese food in Gilbert.."}
{"text":"I would have given them 5 stars but because of the price i can only give 3 stars. The pho is okay compared to the regular pho place I usually go to. The service and place is excellent though. I would go here only if i really want to drive short for a pho. Hopefully they lower their prices a little bit."}
{"text":"This was excellent Pho, I had Tofu vegetable Pho and hubby had sliced steak Pho. Excellent service, quiet cuisine, reasonable prices. Will definitely be back.!"}
{"text":"SaDec is SO good! The service is really good and the environment is so nice. The pho was AMAZING and the summer rolls were delicious. This is going to be our go to pho stop now that we've settled into Gilbert. Would definitely recommend this new place it's really good."}
{"text":"I really was excited to have a new Vietnamese place close to my house.  Wanted to love this place but it was disappointing.  We ordered the imperial roll which came with 4 small pieces for $5.50.  This is the only place in the phx area where we found spring rolls wrapped with rice paper, but it's a bit overpriced.  The combination pho is not as pictured from the business owner.  Much less meat and the noodles we got were not cooked all the way through.  The broth was too salty also.  The bowl might have been enough to feed a hungry kid.  At almost $12, overpriced as well."}
{"text":"Where do I begin?.....I've tried numerous places that \"Specialize\" in Pho and I have to say that straight out of the kitchen the broth was very flavorful and hot! I had ordered the P4 which is flank steak and brisket and I was amazed at flavor of the food. It's not super close to where I live but I will definitely be coming back soon and would recommend this place to anyone looking for good food! The server was very nice and attentive and that's almost rare anymore. Give this place a try it's worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Wow! 

Great service, location, and food. If you are looking for a new Pho place, this is the spot."}
{"text":"This is the best Vietnamese food that I've had in the Valley. The broth for both Bun Bo Hue and Pho Nam were very flavorful. You know it's good when you can see the fat bubbles on top.  The meat in each dish was tender and not dried out. The Cafe sua Da was excellent as well. Not overly bitter because of the coffee and not overly sweet from the condensed milk.  The Goi Cuon appetizer was very good. A good balance of shrimp, pork, and veggies. The peanut sauce for it has been the best I've had, a great combination of sweet and saltiness.  The servers were very polite and brought the food out promptly. The decor is the minimal, but well done. And they had nice easy listening music. This will definitely be my go-to pho restaurant in the Valley. To address the people concerned about the pricing, they are reasonably priced. It may be a dollar or so more than most places around, but you're getting quality food and large portions. It is well worth the money spent."}
{"text":"Wow this place knocks it out of the park! As soon as you walk in the door this amazing aroma hits you and you can't wait to sit and eat! Lol The fried calamari is light and crispy so delicious I haven't had something fried be that light and airy almost. The chicken satay and the sauce it is served with is cooked to perfection. And we haven't even gotten our lunch dishes yet! Lol come check this place out!"}
{"text":"Extremely good food and very good service. I would recommend to anyone that has not had Vietnamese food before. A lot of great options and the menu is layed extremely well.  One of the best places to get pho."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, attentive service, clean and well put together inside. I had the steak and shrimp and my husband some spicy beef bowl. So delicious! My daughter ordered the lemon mascarpone cake and it was heavenly. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We just drove up from Sierra Vista, checked into the hotel and looked for a close place to eat. We were so happy that this restaurant showed up in our search and was within walking distance. We have eaten a lot of Vietnamese before and this was better than most. 

The restaurant was about half full when we arrived.  We were seated immediately. Someone came over to greet us quickly and took our drink order. After promptly bringing our drinks the waiter asked us for appetizer order.

We have a shrimp roll (A2) in the new Sake garlic clams (A12)  for appetizers. This shrimp roll was excellent. Tightly wrapped with fresh shrimp and great crunch. The peanut sauce was also exceptional. I'd like to see Socci Gerwick clams even better. Small manila clams in a bath of garlic sake broth with a tinge of heat. The clams were delicious and my mouth had a beautiful tingling sensation not too hot, when we were done."}
{"text":"Best Pho I've had to date! Super chill atmosphere excellent acoustic music .. the summer roll was fresh and the staff is very pleasant!

Try these guys out you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant many times and the food is always very taste. Can't go wrong with the Pho very good as well."}
{"text":"We've been wondering when the south east valley would get a Vietnamese restaurant and I'm happy to say it's here and the food is wonderful. It's a little different than all the others we've been to in that the vermicelli dishes come with the meat on skewers. To say all three of us liked our choices would be an understatement. The only bad news was that we had nothing left to box and bring home. Place isn't cheap, but you get what you pay for. We'll be back again and again!"}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of Pho all over the country. Being new to AZ I was in search of good Pho. What I found here was the BEST most flavorful Pho ever. For me it's all about the broth and here it was amazing. The service was also great. Besides the Pho, the menu is extensive. Vietnamese coffee was also yummy."}
{"text":"The pho here is always great to have when I'm feeling a little under the weather when I throw a little chilli into it to help clear the sinuses. I love the food here it's good and fresh. Must try it out when you're In the area"}
{"text":"If you are looking for pho, look no pho-ther (further, get it?!). But honestly, this restaurant (which used to be called Red Vietnamese Cuisine and has the same owners and staff) nails it with every single item on their menu. The pho is fantastic and definitely tastes fresh. I would also recommend the noodle dishes, as well as the eggroll and summer roll appetizers. And, they are quick with take-out orders, which are just as delicious and fresh eaten at home, as they would be if dining in. Love this restaurant; it always hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Me: So we did not get the pho, but I don't think that negates our review. 

Craig: No, we can just say that. 

Me: What did we order again?

Craig: It's on the receipt. 

Me: Look at you. 

Craig: Cheat sheet :)

Me: Okay: A1: Imperial Rolls; S1: Dry Egg Noodles with Pork; and C4: Grilled Chicken Sate with Rice. I loved all of them.

Craig: Yes, they were all good. My favorite was the noodles. You?

Me: Hmmm, I actually think it was the Imperial Rolls. But honestly, I'd order all of these again. 

Craig: Now I want to try the pho, too. 

Me: Yeah, sometime when it's not 100 degrees. The service was also really prompt and friendly. 

Craig: And the place is really hip and stylish. Not as barebones as other places. 

Me: Yeah, it's super cute. And the music was soft and non-annoying. And I didn't think the food was overpriced. 

Craig: No, no, it was reasonable. 

Me: Okay, so stars?

Craig: Five. A hard five. 

Me: Hands down."}
{"text":"Great food, place is clean! Inside looks modern, unlike most Asian restaurants that have those old looking everything. Took my mom here and we ordered the noodle dishes (not pho) and loved it! Imperial spring rolls and calamari were delicious too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My husband dislikes all Asian cuisines; with that being said...he loved this place!! If that doesn't tell you something, note I'm also quite picky and this was definitely in my top 3 places in Arizona to get pho. We ordered the fried dumplings to start, then split the lemongrass pork ban mi and the beef steak pho. Everything was very tasty and we will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved the Pho. I had shrimp with chicken broth and my coworker had shrimp with beef broth. I just wish there were a none meat option for the broth and more veggies in the pho. But in all it was absolutely delicious. In hindsight i shouldve gotten the tofu and veggies pho but that'll be on my next visit"}
{"text":"This review is only for to go orders,and not the food. I tried to call in my order only to have a busy signal or constant ringing with no answer but we wanted pho so I thought I'd just place my order at the restaurant. I got here to a half full restaurant (on a Saturday night), and placed my simple order of 2 pho's to go. The hostess told me 15-20 minutes so I went next door to grab a beer. 40 minutes later and I am still sitting here waiting for my food. Not sure why it takes so long when it's pretty much all made in advance, just needs to be assembled. If you are going to offer takeout orders, then you need to have a working phone or way to order online otherwise you need to remove that you offer takeout orders."}
{"text":"Outstanding!  Nice place, love the ambiance and music selection. The service is always reliably good. The food is outstanding, appetizers, Pho, chicken satay....all wonderful. we go regularly and highly recommend SaDec Bistro"}
{"text":"Great local Vietnamese place. the Pho is amazing. we have been there a few times now and the food is always top notch and the service is amazing as well. They would be a great place for a family dinner or romantic dinner for 2. they did a great job with the ambiance and it is not loud in there, that seems to be an issue around here is everyone has a TV blasted well not here. 
Prices are in the 10 to 15 dollar range so it is affordable."}
{"text":"Some of the best Pho and Vietnamese food in the valley! Try it!  This rivals LA restaurants for flavor!  Nice decor and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"pan fried noodle taste delicious ! However would be better adding a bit more seafood I.e scallop , mussel ectt . All They had was chicken and shrimp not much of veggies either .
Pho and bun bo hue taste great !"}
{"text":"This was a great experience eating Pho for the first time! Service was friendly and helpful with letting me know different pho options. The decor in the restaurant is elegant and cozy. Love the color scheme and atmosphere. The location is a bit off the main corner so it's easy to miss. Worth the find !!!"}
{"text":"We moved from Minnesota, with a large population of Hmong, Vietnamese, Thai restaurants.  We had superb Pho options.  Upon arrival in Arizona, the first thing we noticed was the lack of these types of restaurants here.  Well, today, SaDec Bistro took our #1 spot.  It's not a huge place but it is beautifully decorated.

We started with an order of Summer Roll (A2 on the menu) and Imperial Roll (A1 on the menu).  The Summer Roll was fantastic.  Fresh flavors, plump shrimp, great peanut dipping sauce.  The Imperial Roll was good, but it was not my favorite.  There was a flavor on the back end that I did not care for.  This, however, is my personal preference.  My husband loved the Imperial Roll.

We shared a Banh Mi (R10 on the menu), of the Braised Pork variety.  Flavorful, great bread, One flavor did not over power another.  Very well done.

We both ordered the Combination Pho (P5 on the menu).  Wow.  This honestly was one of the best Phos I have had.  The broth was SO flavorful that I did not add Sriracha OR Hoisin to it.  A couple small jalapeno slices, some torn basil, and bean sprouts, and I was in heaven.  The meat was perfect.  I would've liked one more meatball, but over all, this bowl was phenomenal.  Flavorful, filling, yet not so salty, like others I have had.

We will definitely be bringing the 9 year old Pho connoisseur soon, as I think he is having Pho withdrawals since we moved from MN.

Well done SaDec Bistro.  VERY well done."}
{"text":"Get the tofu pho. You won't regret it! The tofu is fantastic and the broth is event better!"}
{"text":"We've been here a total of three times now. The first time was amazing. Great food, great service, and unless something drastic happened I'm pretty sure we'll be customers for life. 

Our second visit wasn't as great as the first. This was partially my fault and partially our servers. This is tricky to explain, but here goes.... The food I ordered was bad, TO me. I'm sure it was well made and most people would think it was delicious, but I didn't like it. The ingredients it had listed on the menu were plentiful, but it also had A LOT of cilantro too. I'm a noob to Vietnam cuisine, so maybe this is common and I don't know this, but the menu didn't state it had cilantro. Aside from that it was spicy as promised. According to my wife, her meal was on point, but she said the particular batch of chili paste we seemed to be lacking. Now for the restaurants fault. The service wasn't great. The waitress didn't check on us at all and after we paid she gave our change to a different table. This was troubling because we were one of only three tables in there. The way I see was this was it was my fault for trying something new, and their fault for poor service. But still I was willing to give this place another chance.

You can see that I realized the reason I didn't like my food on the second visit was because I just didn't like it. It was made fine and I have nothing poor to say about their food quality. With that in mind we went back a third time (in two weeks). Our last visit was mixed. The food was awesome, probably better than the first time, but I may have went overboard on the VERY effective chili paste. The service again was lacking. It was about half-capacity, but it still took a very long time to order our drinks/food. It took so long to just order our drinks we ordered our dinner at the same time for fear of being forgotten again. Once the food arrived service wasn't much better at first, but towards the end of our visit it picked up. 

All-in-all I can't wait to go back and get some more pho. I've been telling anyone that will listen to try this place out. This place is awesome and even though the foods always amazing, it's a hit-or-miss on the service. I'm sure it's nothing, but this is the type of place, due to the service, that I feel more comfortable only using cash at. Overall I'm pleased."}
{"text":"Delicious pho! Fantastic spring roles! Laid back atmosphere! This is a phenomenal place to bring a date or a friend for a chill meal."}
{"text":"Great authentic Vietnamese food. Pho broth was so tasty. Service was fast and friendly. Def will come back to try the whole menu."}
{"text":"Way over priced for okay pho! Will not make the drive all the way here. Be carful on what you add, they will charge you extra on everything!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and charges extra for a simple side even though we purchased an appetizer. I don't mind paying extra for additional meat or veggies, but to be charged extra for garlic is gouging. Prices are already at a premium. We will no longer come here. We have other closer options that don't charge extra."}
{"text":"Tried this place because it's close to the house. I'm an asian food fanatic! I was born Asian in another lifetime. I swear. Regardless, the food was pretty good. Not amazing Pho but great. I've had better elsewhere. The size of the pho compared to the price ($10) was also very small. Given it is enough for one person, at every other place I've been to the size of the bowl is twice than what it is here and either the same or less in cost. The biggest negative about this new place is the unfiltered air coming out of the kitchen. I'm not sure if a vent is broken or what have you, but the odor of fried rolls and deep frying oil was constantly in the atmosphere, so much so that my eyes were almost burning during my entire meal and my clothes stunk of it after leaving. For this reason alone I would not come back."}
{"text":"Loved the Pho here! So far that's all we tried but super yummy. Additionally it's small so it was nice that it wasn't super crowded when we went in there. But we did look around at what other people ordered and it looked pretty good too. No complaints thus far"}
{"text":"This place has the absolute best pho I have ever had but if they don't improve the service I will have to find some place else to satisfy my pho addiction. 1 1/2 hours is just unacceptable. Please improve your service so I can change my review to a 5."}
{"text":"Finally a fantastic Pho restaurant in Glibert/QC! We have been in three times and the food has been amazing. It is a family-owned restaurant; great service and great food. Try the seafood Udonanf the calamari and you will love the Pho."}
{"text":"I've been here when it was Red Koi and served only
Sushi. Then it became Red when they served sushi and Viet food. Now, as SaDec they only have Viet. Food is always good but overpriced. 
Tonight we tried the spring rolls. Very freshly made with fresh ingredients and delish peanut sauce. Reminded me of my mom's. Then we tried the jalapeño shrimp. Again delicious. Husband had the shaking beef and I had the salmon. Both tasted good. But our total was close to $50. I've been to plenty of Viet places and never have I seen spring rolls for $7 before. Normally it's $5 or less. I can understand a place charging more when they use high quality ingredients.

Granted like I said they tasted fresh and good. But the pricing has always been high."}
{"text":"Love the pho! I've been eating here for years (previous name). It's the best place I've seen with pho. Broth is flavorful."}
{"text":"This place is by far the BEST pho in the valley! Service is great too. We have tried many things on the menu and are always extremely happy!! I love this place!!"}
{"text":"Great place for dinner. Great prices... I am a repeat customer . The Pho Gua is good soup. Garlic fried rice is to die for"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch one day, and tried the Pho, originally wanted the Bun bo hue but asked to substitute with egg noodles and they said a $2 charge?  Just changing out the noodle type here guys!?  So I tried the Pho, Small portion for the price.  the Pho is good to average here.  I would give a 4 star, but 3 for how expensive compared to other Pho restaurants are in the valley. $12 for a small bowl of pho and water.  $14 after tip."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place serving pho closer to home. But this was the most expensive smaller bowl of pho I have ever seen. This little place is pricey for the not so great quality of food. I would rather make the drive for better tasting pho. However, they had decent service."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for a great place to get pho near my house. Excellent food! The pho is great and the broth is fantastic! My wife had a crispy noodle dish that was great as well. The summer rolls were light and very flavorful. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We are so happy to have a Pho place so close to home! Great service. Very nice inside. Amazing flavor in their dishes. We will be back to keep exploring the menu. I had the garlic steak with mushrooms and onions. YUMMY"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this location. Great customer service, food, and the environment.  Pricing was also reasonable."}
{"text":"After reading a couple other reviews, I thought prices can't be that much more then the average Vietnamese restaurants. Well I was wrong. Prices are ridiculous here !! Don't get me wrong, the food was decent, but the prices make me cringe a little. The most I've paid for a bowl of Pho is right under $8 dollars, but at this joint, one bowl of pho is the price of two at some other places. It's just really nice that this place is close to where I'm at, but my golly gosh i wouldn't mind driving to Gilbert or chandler for better pricing. Menu selection is pretty big, the environment was nice, a little too quiet for my taste.. but nice. But again I can't get over the prices. 2 summer rolls for $7, 2 imperial rolls(egg rolls) $6.50. To be honest I wanted to get the special combo but could not justify spending $13 dollars on a bowl when I'm use to spending $7 on average. The size of the bowl is pretty small too. Maybe I just have a big appetite but I've been more full ordering off a In N Out menu then after eating a bowl of pho here. Probably won't come back because I can't justify spending $40 on a meal for two when I'm use to spending $25 AT MOST, and that's with boba smoothies. But this is just my opinion, to each there own."}
{"text":"The food was yummy. I loved that they separated it for me. The staff was super friendly and kind. The prices were a tad on the high side."}
