{"text":"The other location has seemed to close, (noticed while walking to pizza place next door) saw that coming! Don't waste your time over paying for this food. Not very good customer service either!"}
{"text":"Swung into Joeys the other day to grab something quick while I was killing some time. Noticed right when I walked in their special of a chicago dog, fries, and a drink for 4.99 and gave it a whirl. It was awesome! great dog loved all the fixings! They gave a decent amount of fries that were good and the topper was that they had malt vinegar for them! The service was great everyone was really friendly and fast. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been eating Chicago Style Food for 25 years and this is not even close to authentic. I visited both of their stores, the new one just opening by my home, and I thought maybe with a second store they got something right. WRONG. The dog was over cooked, the beef was tasteless at best. With the strong Chicago presence in the Valley, I would think this place could find someone who knows how to make a Dog."}
{"text":"Not good or terrible. Just average. If you want a good Italian beef or Chicago dog go to Diazzo's in Glendale. And the fries are really good."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp during a business training here in northern phoenix. It was either here or the burger place around the corner. I'm glad I  Picked here. I was greeted upon walking in the door, I got the Chicago dog combo with mozzarella sticks. Whole thing was 6$ great deal for what I got. I love me a good Chicago dog, and this was by far the best I have ever had. Flavorful frank, great fresh bun and fresh veggies with just the right amount of mustard on it. Oh and the mozzarella sticks, exploded with cheese and were incredibly fresh. I am by far satisfied and will be leaving with a smile on my face. You should really check this place out."}
{"text":"I would drive miles just to eat at Joeys.  Quality food!. Great staff! I love everything on the menu."}
{"text":"I always enjoy Chicago themed eateries but I was severely disappointed in my dining experience at Joeys. We ordered a chop salad, Chicago dog  and chili.  There was us and one other diner in the restaurant, on a Friday night (hint). It took 25 minutes to get our very simple order. The salad was good, the dog was just ok and the chili was disgusting. I took a bite of the chili and so did my wife, thats all we needed. 
The staff was pleasant but just wasn't engaged in customer service. 
Probably wont re-visit for quite sometime."}
{"text":"And folks, there you have it! A legit Chi-Town beef in the middle of the Desert! 
When was the last time you had an awesome Italian Beef sandwich in February, and walked outside to high 70Â° temps?! Oh never?! That's because you've only had them in Chicago. 
Bravo Joey's! 
I typically prefer a fairly Dry Beef(Ordered Lil-Wet in Chicago) So I went for Dry here and also got a small cup of gravy/hot peppers on the side. Added just a little bit and it was exactly how I like it. Bread held together perfectly until the last bite! 
If you're from Chicago and craving a Beef, not willing to settle for that Chicago place that opened here, GO OUT OF YOUR WAY to go to Joeys! 
And for you Non-Chicagoans, if you want to see what the buzz is about with Chicago Style Italian Beef, this is your spot to go!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the fish and chips, my brother did not like the burgers but I tasted it and it was delicious"}
{"text":"If you are looking for an authentic Chicago style hot dog this is the place!  Only one that compares is Portillo's in Scottsdale!  Now it is in your own back yard!  More fries than I could eat and service was prompt and pleasant!  Give Joeys a chance they won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome.  Customer service... not so much.  Went the first night to have the girl at the counter getting ready to get off.  She takes my order and then proceeds to clock out with people standing in line.  The relief person isn't ready to take over.. she just walks off to get her soda and then proceeds to yell across the joint to tell the guy she's leaving.  Went again tonight so the girls could compare it to Portillos.  Ordered 8 items.. made it home with 7.  Called to let them know... no one even said sorry once.  Nothing... really?!?!  We're dying for good restaurants in this neck of the woods but this place will never last if they don't advertise (only found out about them by driving by and happening to see the back of the place) and improve their customer service.  I don't care how good your food is, I'll drive 30 miles to Scottsdale for customer service to get my Italian beef if it doesn't get better.  Way I look at it, I'm going to give it one more try.  Hopefully it'll be better and I'll get all my food."}
{"text":"Not what I was expecting.Good Joey's menu but Joey needs to teach how to serve good Chi-town food!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Joeys before, and enjoyed the food but my experience while catering a large event from this place was ATTROCIOUS. Hence the two stars. 

**EDIT: I was contacted by one of the store owners less than 24 hrs after my post. She apologized for the inconvenience and made the staff aware of proper packaging to prevent all future \"beefspills\" I appreciate the follow up and concern. Ultimately, If I had spoken with an owner I think the experience would have been handled better. This location gets an \"A\" for effort.***

Here's what originallyhappened:
I ordered the Italian beef which was packaged in one of those tin catering containers and was FILLED to the BRIM with liquid instead of the liquid being packaged separately (you know, to accommodate for traveling)  and then wrapped several times in saran wrap. WHY.  The juice had spilled out of the container, the saran wrap bunched to the side and the tin foil top was folded backwards. I'm no mario andretti on the road and I only life 10 miles away from this location so I can only factor POOR PACKAGING in to this scenario... BUMMER FOR ME, RIGHT?

However, I contacted management simply to let them know that this had happened and that it was due to poor packaging in hopes that I would in some way be compensated. The shift manager was polite and told me he would call me back once he had spoken with the owner. He called me back to inform me that there was nothing they could do for my car (ok- that sucks but I GUESS I understand) and that they would offer me 10% off of my NEXT catering event with them. REALLY? thats how you handle your customers? I'm sorry, but not even taking the time to assess my situation and then doing NOTHING to remedy it is POOR customer service. Why would I use this place for catering in the future? to get my car all Beef'd up again? no way.

Eat there if you like a chicago \"feel\" but if you are catering an event.... line your car with a shower curtain beforehand or at LEAST double check the seals, lids and containers before putting them into your vehicle."}
{"text":"When I am home sick for Chicago food this is my go-to! The Hot dogs and Beef are the best I have found in the valley. I would have given them 5 stars but they seem to have training issues."}
{"text":"Joey's was clean and the staff was friendly. I had the Italian beef sandwich with fries and a soda. The total was about $10 for my meal and the quality of the beef was good. I would definitely come back. Oh, got to have the cheese sauce with the fries though :)"}
{"text":"Went here for an Italian Beef.... Being a big fan of Chicago junk food, I thought I would give it a go. Friendly staff claimed that they modeled the place after Portillos in Chicago. Good place to try and emulate. That said, the beef sandwich was very good size, the hot peppers and sweet peppers were very tasty and the flavor was great. y only complain was that the beef was a bit tough.... If you ever ate a Portillos Italian beef, you would know that the beef should just fall apart and be very juicy... Seemed to me that maybe the beef didn't quite cool long enough.... Bottom line is, the place is pretty new and I think will get better and better. I would definitely go back. Give it a try"}
{"text":"The best Italian beef sandwich in Surprise. Glad we don't have to drive all the way to Portillo's or Luke's in Scottsdale to get a decent fricken beef sandwich. Haven't tried the hot dog yet but when I do I'll give you and honest posting. The beef with peppers, fries & drink was just over $10 which I find a bit pricey for a lunch deal."}
{"text":"I wouldn't really say reasonable prices. 21 bucks for two dogs and half a sub sandwich.  The jumbo dogs are smaller then circle k dogs. Not impressed.  Most likely will not be returning."}
{"text":"I was excited to find out this place was here, especially because I live nearby, and had high expectations. Unfortunately I was let down.

When we got there, a couple tables were occupied by people already eating. A woman and her daughter were in line ahead of us, placing their order. A man with three young boys was behind us. We all placed our order at the counter and grabbed tables to wait for our food to be ready to pick up. Nobody else came in to order while we were there.

The woman and her daughter got their food relatively quickly. I thought this was a good sign, but it was not to be. Although the three people behind the counter seemed to be scurrying around, no food was forthcoming. After a long time, I saw one of the people place an order of fries, presumably mine, on a tray under a heat lamp. A few minutes later, she placed another order of fries on another tray under a different lamp. Several minutes after that she added several sandwiches to the second tray. And then she added a sandwich to the original tray with the fries that had now been sitting there a good ten minutes. Nothing aggravates me more than seeing my food sit under a heat lamp for an extended period of time.

At this point my wife went up to the pickup counter to ask what was going on. They finally brought out her salad and said they'd bring the dressing to the table. 

At this point, the only chance the restaurant had of having us as repeat customers was outrageously good food, but things fell short. My wife's salad was big, had plenty of chicken, and she said it was very fresh, but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. I was expecting something amazing from the Chicago beef considering it's the restaurant's specialty, but it was just OK.

Maybe we caught them on a bad day, maybe they were buried with takeout orders, maybe other menu items are outstanding, and maybe my expectations were way too high. Regardless, I was disappointed and won't be back."}
{"text":"Tammie (co-owner),


First of all the service was horrible. Waited over 35 minutes for my meal to come up. I wish during that time I would have read reviews on the restaurant. You received a \"D\" rating and it was not for cutting boards, there were several health violations. I find this to be disgusting and when I asked about this rating,  your employees seemed lost and had no idea what I was talking about. Why is your health rating not posted ? On the door? Wall by check stand ?
I know you might be embarrassed by your rating but you can't hide from it. Fix the issues and don't allow them to go on. 
When I asked to speak to a manager there was no one available ? They couldn't provide a phone number ? Couldn't provide a name ? Anything couldn't be provided.
Unfortunately it seems like there are many issues here that need to be corrected.
I will be contacting the health department, very disappointed in the quality of the food, service, everything top to bottom."}
{"text":"I've never been to Chicago so I don't know what their food is like, but I imagine it's a lot like Joey's of Chicago. 

The restaurant used to be a Fazoli's, but with their unfortunate downfall (I miss their bread sticks so much!), its only appropriate that another decent restaurant take its place. 

When you walk into Joey's it's filled with memorabilia from Chicago, which is pretty cool. I really like the randomness of the different items on the wall. There is a lot of seating too. 

I usually get the Hot Italian Beef sandwich with peppers and cheese sauce. I also get fries on the side. The sandwich is pretty good. I recommend getting au jus sauce on the side and not actually on the sandwich itself. It makes the sandwich too soggy when ordered that way. The fries are not nothing to write home about. They seemed undercooked to me. 

The food seemed a little pricey to me. They do use Vienna Beef products so you might be paying for quality.

The service was pretty good. They took my order and brought my food to the table, which is awesome."}
{"text":"Pretty good food and prices here. Sometimes wait is a bit longer than expected. Good for a lunch spot."}
{"text":"Solid Chicago-style Italian beef with hot giardiniera peppers.  Fries were good.  I'll certainly go back to try the Chicago-style hot dog some time soon."}
{"text":"Cheap eats in a good way! This is a great place to go to for a quick bite on the go! I ordered the Jumbo Chili Dog All Beef Vienna Hot Dog, whoa.. look out. I know it's a sloppy kind of lunch when on the go, but sometimes, when you come to an establish that offers a Jumbo Chili Dog, you HAVE to order it. It was fresh and hot and every bit DE-LISH! 

I definitely recommend coming here and the menu items are very affordable!"}
{"text":"Being from the Chicago area it is great to have this place so close to home! I have been here a few times now and each time has been a great experience. The food is spot on and service is exceptional. I usually get the Italian Beef because well, it's great!! Always dipped with giardiniera peppers and a side of extra juice. Fries are fries, they are good here but its really hard to mess up fries. I have had their Chicago Dog once and it is a true Chicago Dog! One of the best parts of coming here is the Jays chips! If you are a Chicagoan you know what I am talking about, when they say \"just can't stop eating 'em!\" they mean it. 
It's nice seeing a lot of the familiar street names around the place and images of different \"hot\" spots from Chicago. the decor is clean and the seating is very open and nice. You are not on top of the next table or having to hear everyone conversations. 
Keep up the great service delicious food."}
{"text":"Would love to give it more stars but... I was let down. There are few things I love more than a good Chicago dog and when it comes to that there doing it right. However, the fries and onion rings were terrible! The oil must has been days old, you could taste the chemical breakdown that oil gets when it's been over used... Over all I would come back but mid day to the latest if this is going to be a corner they are going to cut on a regular basis."}
{"text":"Yummy, Italian beef was so good. Hot peppers were awesome. French fries are super tasty"}
{"text":"These are some Chicago style hot dogs I could get addicted to.  Great fries as well.

A lot of ex-Chicago-ans judge a Chicago style restaurant on their italian beef.  I always enjoyed a good Portillo's beef, but for me the Chicago style dog is where it's at. Neon relish, sport peppers, celery salt, tomatoes, and a pickle spear really make a perfect dog for me... and this place does it great, for only $1.99 a dog!   Not to mention, their chili cheese dogs and fries remind me of some 2am trips to Hoagie Hut, at which I gained 20 pounds in 3 months after moving in across the street.

Come to think of it, you might want to stay away unless you enjoy shopping for larger pairs of pants.  Enjoy in moderation, people.

PS - This is in the old Fasoli's, next to BevMo."}
{"text":"Very good Chicago style hit dogs and sandwiches. Beef sandwich was decent, I added hot peppers & provolone cheese dipped. Overall very tasty and I enjoyed the flavors."}
{"text":"You know what I love about this place? Everything. If you are from Chicago, you will really love it. Great hotdogs exactly like you remember them, Italian beefs that could possibly rival places in Chicago. That's hard to do.  I tried some Jay's potato chips instead of fries on my last visit since I have never seen them before outside of Chicago- delicious! 

They always have a Classic Rock Chicago radio station playing and when I'm here, I could swear that I am back in the windy city.   The booths are very nice and comfortable and each one has its own Chicago street named after it which is a very nice touch. Even the place mat has dozens of Chicago trivia on it: did you know that Chicago has 29 miles of lake front and 15 miles of public beach?"}
{"text":"I honestly wanted to give this a half a star or no stars at all we got there a little before 7:30pm ordered and was told when I told them we'd be eating it there they would be closing at 8pm which don't they close at 9pm? So by the time we got our food we would have had to eat the food in like 15 mins. So we ended up getting it to go. When we got home both my husband and I were not impressed with our sandwiches his didn't look or taste anything like what it sounded like a french dip to me & mine had barely any meat on it & had huge poorly cut up tomatoes and end pieces of lettuce. We won't be eating there again. Next time I want a good meal from Chicago I'll make it myself . With the money we spent we could have made more from buying it at the store. Or going someplace else when dinner is a last min. thing."}
{"text":"I hit Joeys on Happy Valley about once a month. Get the dog with the onions, peppers, poppy seed bun and chase it down with some fries and a soda....really hits the spot. I like to sit where I can look at the west wall which is a huge wallpaper picture of downtown Chi-town. Anyway, these are the kind of dogs that you cock your head to the side when you take a bite and all of the poppy seeds fall off on to the foil...then you dip the dog and bun into the poppy littered foil and take another bite. You know what I am talking about and don't even act like you don't!"}
{"text":"Live in Mich and can't get a semblance of a decent Italian beef. Visiting family in Phx had 3 of them on 3 separate occasions. Is it Portillo's, a fave of mine when in Chitown? No, but pretty darn good in its own way. Hot giardiniera pretty awesome. Really nice firm and tasty fries. And Green River to boot. All in all, got my fix. Nice folks too. Thanks Joey's for a taste of home.  Only thing, do something about the smell in the bathroom."}
{"text":"Great food better than Portilos. The hot dog is great, tamales awesome and wet beef the best."}
{"text":"Love Joey's!!! The closest thing to home (that I've found) in AZ. Great giardiniera & beef, vienna hot dogs, and good fries. Service is always friendly and prompt even when they are busy. Was in on Sunday for $.99 Chgo style hot dogs after Da Bears win and it was packed!"}
{"text":"It's always dicey when looking for a great Italian Beef sandwich here in Phoenix.  Most of the time I find the best ones at small places that end up not lasting very long.  I'm hoping that Joey's stays around as this is my new place for Italian Beef.  I've been here about a dozen times and I get the Italian Beef every time.  The fries are also solid, but I'm not a big fry guy.  Joey's has the option of adding cheese sauce to their Italian Beef, which I never get.  That sounds too much like a Philly-Italian Beef.  Joey's also offers it three ways: dry, wet, or dipped.  Now I like my Italian Beef very wet.  But it seems my liking is somewhere between wet and dipped.  Usually when I get wet it's a little too dry, and when I get dipped it's drenched.  That's the only complaint I have."}
{"text":"2 of my kids had the hot dog kids meal - Not bad the other had a burger which he loved. My hubby had a loaded Chicago style dog with onion rings (yum) & I had the chicken salad (man it was huge) It fed me my son & my husband....We would go back."}
{"text":"I have lived most of my life in the Chicagoland area, so I knew I had to try this place!

I came with very high expectations and was very pleased with the interior of this quick service restaurant. The tables were fun to sit at with the street names and decorated walls.

The food was pretty good, although I really didn't like the burger at all and wouldn't order that again. The hot dog however was on the spot and when I come again I will just stick with that!

All in all it's not Portillo's, but it wasn't bad and I would be pleased to try it again!"}
{"text":"Great place, I've had the hot dogs and the polish sausage, they're both pretty good, but my fave is the polish sausage. I totally love the malt vinegar on my fries.  
The food is always hot and fresh, the staff is friendly and the place is always clean.
Yes, this is on our regular rotation for lunch. Love the music as well!"}
{"text":"Over all I liked it.  For a family it is a decent place to go to get a quick meal.  All of us ended up getting hot dogs.  They were decent, but not great.  My kids each had fries which were o.k.  The wife and I split the onion rings.  I've had better.  We got out of there for less than a $20 bill.  I would go back, but it certainly isn't on the top 20.  it is a nice alternative though to other fast food establishments.  Service was quick and friendly.  Summary-decent but plain food with good service.  I would suggest to the young man cleaning tables to pull your pants up.  Really didn't need to know you had blue plaid boxers on-that were more then 1/2 exposed."}
{"text":"Came here one evening to check it out and was pleasantly surprise. I then recommended it to a group of retirees and 15 went for lunch. After five or six ordered, the manager came out and said they were \"out of beef.\"  How does a restaurant run out of its signature product?  Call before you go to be sure they haven't run out!"}
{"text":"Pricey for hot dogs, etc. Nothing spectacular or even noteworthy. Ted's in Tempe/Mesa was much much better"}
{"text":"They get one star for cleanliness and decor. Aside from that, the service was horrible and they were out of half of the items on the menu."}
{"text":"Wasn't a big fan. I didn't try the Italian Beef everyone is so crazy because I wasn't craving beef. All their other food just taste frozen."}
{"text":"Ive been in about 10 times and have yet to be disapointed. Chicago beef sandwich with hot peppers and liquid cheddar is amazing. Chicago dogs are also about as chicago as it gets without flying there. Fries, onion rings, fried mushrooms...all are excellent. My dad even prefers their burgers over many others. Great food, great service, and very clean every single time ive been in. Compared to other Surprise joints, this place kicks ass."}
{"text":"I get a chili cheese dog from here on occasion - the price is right, and the food is decent enough.  I'll try some of the other fare from here in the future."}
{"text":"Being that I'm from Chicago, I do have high expectations for a \"Chicago dog\".  It is by comparison a good \"Chicago dog\", however does not seem to have as much flavor as one from Chicago.  I don't know if this is due to the type of hot dogs used (I know at least most if not all the ones I've eaten in Chicago were kosher) or something else.  But they aren't bad.  The breaded mushrooms are good, although they are definitely greasy.  The French fries are also good (especially with the cheese!).  We did a takeout order and everything was wrapped in foil to help stay hot, and it made it back to our office (a couple blocks away) with no problem.  I would visit again, but stand by my current 3-star rating of the food."}
{"text":"Returned to Joey's and tried the Italian Sub.

It was by far the best Italian sub sandwich I have had in Arizona.  It was reminiscent of Italian sub sandwiches I had while in the Philadelphia area.

The Maxwell Street polish was also good.  The fries were hot and crisp.

If you are in the area it would be a pleasant stop for lunch."}
{"text":"Went to place an order togo last night..we walked in and there was a big sign saying 25% off their new pizza. So we ordered pizza for the kids and sandwiches for the rest of the family. After she processed my credit card I realized she didn't give me the discount, when I questioned it her response was \"oh I thought it was if you only bought pizza\" apparently she didn't know how to take the discount off one item and not the whole bill.....maybe a little better training next time..anyways after they talked amongst themselves and couldn't figure it out I just said \"forget it\" they didn't seem like they really wanted to fix the problem anyways. The food is fine and I know they recently lowered their prices but its still hard to pay $40 for dinner and walk away annoyed....."}
{"text":"Started a new job in the area - was looking for something good, but not fast food. This place is awesome!!!

I ordered the Crispy Chicken Salad. It is huge and it was prepped right where I could see.

The best part of Joeys, to me, today at least, is that they brew China Mist Passion Fruit Iced Tea!!!!!! This makes me disgustingly happy! I wish their drink prices were a bit cheaper. I can go to AJ's and get the same tea but a 24oz for $1.51. At Joey's I paid 1.75 for a 16oz. If it were not for the price of the drink, I would go daily!"}
{"text":"Beef sandwich - Yes!! We loved the fries and rings too!

Is it pricey? Yes, it is....but, it's a very good sandwich!

We don't go that often, however I have never had a problem - food is always hot & delicious."}
{"text":"Great hot dogs, fries and hot beef sandwiches!  Staff is friendly and eager to please..."}
{"text":"2-4 stars
Update- I am increasing the rating because of the owner involvement.  I have not revisited this location, but the effort to right a customer complaint is highly regarded in my book,"}
{"text":"Hey... they ran out of sweet pickles at 1pm on a weekday?  

Fishdog was not good! and costs a far bit.  I have been there and had better.  

Will be back..."}
{"text":"The specialty at this place is a Italian Beef.  I must say, it was not bad, but I have really had better.  

What really helped give the extra star are the french frys.  Perfect!  Really, perfect!  Great flavor, crispy but not crunchy, and not greasy.  

The Chicago dogs also help.  I think they are only like $2 each, and pretty damn good.  

Definitely worth stoping in if you find yourself in the area.  Just not worth extended travel."}
{"text":"OK Surprise folks. We need to make this place stick around! Italian beef with that heavenly liquid cheese is great. Italian sausage is grilled which adds a nice nutty flavor. Fry's are just OK but the sandwiches are the stars here. And don't forget the giardinira!"}
{"text":"I am a Chicago boy, bred and raised on Italian beefs.  Johnny's, Bouna Beef, Portillos and a slew of mom and pop shops.  

Having just moved to Phoenix, I thought I would have to suffer a bit without my regular fix of Italian beef, wet and hot.  I am pleased to say, I found a highly acceptable solution here in town, mere miles from my house.

The beef and sausage were dead on, the jus was great, the hot gairdinera (sp?) (Vienna) was exactly what I wanted.  Ok, the bread is not perfect, it lacks something, it is not Turano from Chicago.  Even the fries (skin on) were very good.

To top off the experience, the interior decor is a great shout out to my kind of town.  Familiar street signs, skyline views and even a Chicago rock radio station playing in the background made for a wonderful, homesick lunch.

Only negative - I had a cannoli that was only slightly filled at the ends and hollow in the middle - Not cool.

I will soon be a regular and ultimately the duke of Joey's.  


PS: last plus - I didn't have to climb over mounds of snow and slush to get into the shop."}
{"text":"Whoah. The most authentic Chicago dog in Phoenix. Other places (Luke's, Chicago Hamburger, Al's), can learn a thing or two. First off, the place is spotless. It's nice to eat at a place where the restaurateur understands that keeping his place clean is an important aspect of the customer experience. Nice not to have dusty nasty t-shirts hanging from the walls. The fries here are also better comparable to other valley Chi-dog eateries. They perfectly match. This will now be a required stop along the way for any trip to/from northern AZ.

The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars was the beef sandwich. Sorry guys, but my gold standard for thin sliced Italian beef is Portillos (Joey's beef was almost twice as thick, the bread didn't have that toasted flaky feel, and the gravy just didn't do it for me)."}
{"text":"This was the first place we ate at while moving to Cave Creek. We were in our home the night before the movers were set to deliver our things - and we were hungry. We called in an order for carry out about 30 minutes before closing - we didn't anticipate It would take long for this food to be cooked. The staff on the phone did not do a good job hiding their upset. My husband headed out and during this time got lost finding the location and made it right at closing time. He picked up the food and was again treated to a bad attitude.

The food was nothing to write home about. No dipping sauces were provided/offered, things were messily thrown in the box and the taste was average. I get upset when places mentally close before they are closed.

We haven't returned in 6 months of living here and have no plans to do so."}
{"text":"Chicago dog was terrific!  Our first time and we will be back for another and to try the chilli dog because it looked great!!!"}
{"text":"We visited on a Saturday evening. We had 4 adults and 4 children. The space is clean and well designed and interesting looking. 

We ordered 2 beef sandwiches, several hot dogs, the meatball sub, a children's cheeseburger, and a side salad. The salad was fresh and Italian dressing was tasty. The hot dogs were definitely Chicago dogs although they weren't hot when we got them. The fries all came out hot and were good. 

The beef sandwiches were quite dissapointing. The beef was visually unappealing- grey and limp looking. Quite frankly it was lacking any flavor, it mostly tasted old and microwaved. The \"gravy\" was not flavorful either, it looked like it was going to taste good and homemade and was quite the opposite. My daughter said she wouldn't order the cheeseburger again. My son enjoyed the meatball sub and would order it again. 

Overall the hotdogs and fries would be worth visiting again to get a Chicago dog fix and seeing if the come out hot next time. The service and cleanliness warrant another visit but I won't give more than 2 stars because if the food."}
{"text":"Joey's part two. Arrived at 12:40 on a Wednesday for lunch. It was about 1/4 full but I knew what I wanted: a fire dog (spicy polish dog with sport peppers) on a poppy seed bun, cole slaw and soft drink for $8. 

So sad-they hadn't made up the slaw yet. I chose chips, which were Jay's chips. Pretty weak choice there. Must be a Chicago thing. 

The dog was awesome as always. Soft, fresh bun, big sausage, mustard, hot peppers, smothered in caramelized onions. It was epic. Keep those fire dogs coming!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty bomb and their staff is very kind. P.s. Galen C. Is the best if you can, ask to speak with him. Very impressed."}
{"text":"This time when I tried Joey's the first thing I did was to try the men's room. It w much better than my first visit. The wretched odor was gone! YEA!!! That being said, the whole dining area was less than clean.

It wasn't filthy, as if I was watching an episode of Horders, it just needed someone to come through and clean off a table now and then. I know, the problem with people is they are messy. Come on, someone act like they own the place and they want people to come back. I don't want to have to clean up someone else's mess just to sit down and eat a hot dog.

Learn a lesson from In-N-Out Burger and have a flunky go through the dining area with a bottle of cleaner and a rag and give the place a once over now and then.

On the bright side, the got my order right this time. For that and the pleasant men's room smell they deserve another star, but please, please tidy the place up!"}
{"text":"Joey's is a fun place to stop and grab a Chicago Red Hot, and the prices are really sweet!

Like most Chicago places here in the Valley, Joey's has quite a bit of visual stuff going on when you enter the store.  Pictures of the Chicago River, etc.  The fake ivy and brick wall (photo) near where you order is a nice nod towards the Cubies.  If you are from the Southside though, you might not like it as much.  Oh, well!

I also really like the texts (so signup!) offering discounts during football season when the Bears win a game.  Nice!  The only drawback is the location off I-17 and Happy Valley.  It can be a little bit of a schlep from the east valley.  But, the food is good and well worth the trip in our opinion!  So, if you are up at the outlets in Anthem, this might be a stop on the way back.  Hint, hint!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Awful service and food. We ordered our food and it was pretty empty so when we were told 5-7minutes we believed them. After watching the girls play around for 27 minutes, we had to go ask where our food was. We were told that they were waiting for the cheese to melt because the bread was frozen...........they specialize in subs, yet their sub bread is frozen. Once we finally got our food, the Italian beef sandwich was pretty hot, but the frozen bread was now burnt to a crisp, yet soggy on the bottom. The other food we orders was ice cold, obviously it was made first. The beef tasted freezer burnt. I guess we shouldn't have been surprised since there were two teenage girls making the food. 

I will never return, and I hope I help others avoid this terrible place."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to joey's and I was just driving by. If you like and Italian beef sandwich you will not be disappointed here. Fry's are crispy and the juice is tasty. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"They're a unique and delicious place to eat. Friendly staff and a memorable atmosphere. I enjoyed the char-broiled cheeseburger, the Chicago dog and the turkey sub. I wouldn't go again for the meatball because of the poor execution and horrible quality of the meat. But if you're a fan of authentic Chicago style food and oldies music, it's your place."}
{"text":"How do they dare call this a Chicago hot dog?  The dog is the size of a pencil and you can't taste if it's real all beef.  If you are used to Chicago hot dogs from Chicago, don't go here!"}
{"text":"Great food!!!! Prices are a little high. Almost 4 bucks for a Chicago dog is a little pricy. However the food is excellent.  I personally would recommend the Italian beef combo (#3) . Amazing!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I've only been once, but I'll return if I'm in surprise again. I had the Italian sausage sandwich \"dipped\" with mozzarella and hot peppers. THIS SANDWICH WAS SOOO GOOD."}
{"text":"So I figured I would add this update. The owner contacted me over yelp and apologies and wanted to send me a gift certificate via email. I thought that was a good gesture to have me come back and try this place again. Well been months still not seen a gift certificate come across my email even in my junk mail."}
{"text":"Ate there or the first time and was not impressed with it. My wife and son ordered the Italian beef sandwich and were very disappointed with it. It was very heavily flavored with black pepper (overwhelming). Now if that's how its supposed to be, I apologize. I have never had this before and was caught off guard with the black pepper flavor (and I'm a hot sauce/spice freak)"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Joey's selection of the Chicago radio station, The Drive 97.1 FM; they feature classic rock.

On to the food. The Polish Sausage comes standard with yellow mustard, two sport peppers and grilled onions on a sesame bun. In Chicago we just say \"I want a Polish\". IMHO, this is the best item on the menu. 

The Italian Beef can be garnished with roasted green peppers and melted cheese but their version of roasted green peppers falls way short of expectation. They just thinly slice some green bell peppers and steam them. Plus they use way too much oregano and/or salt & pepper in the au jus. If I could fix one thing about Joey's it would be the Italian Beef.

Their Chicago style hot dogs are decent and worth ordering. I used to not like their Italian sausages because they used to overcook them. But they do a good job with them now. Although they seem to be on the spicy side but definitely worth ordering. Their meatball sandwich is good sans the oregano. They really love their oregano at Joey's. The fries are okay but they do tend to put a lot of salt on them, so say  \"easy on the salt Joey!\""}
{"text":"The Co-Owner contacted me only hours after I wrote my Yelp and informed me they are on that situation.

How Cool is that"}
{"text":"Met friends for lunch.  I'm from the Chicago area and they are fans of Chicago style hot dogs, so it was the ideal setting for us.  Now I've been rather hungry from a good wet Italian Beef and I wasn't disappointed at all.  Both of my friends also enjoyed it with one willing to drive the distance to return again.  One friend had the Italian Beef like me and the other had the Chicago style Polish Sausage.  We're good hardy eaters and we left satisfied with the portions.

The staff was fun to work with, even the cook coming up to the counter to talk to us before preparing our food.  The environment was Chicago themed, reminding me of the high-lights of home.

Will I return, sure will, especially when a craving for good wet Italian Beef returns, I will have to try something else on the menu sometime, but the IB is what they are famous for and I can see why."}
{"text":"Felt like I was inconviencing the cashier with my order. She seemed to have an attitude. They are not cheap so I had an isse with that.  the Italian beef was suppose to be wet and it was dry and looked better than it tasted. The hotdog was ehh but the polish sausage was good. Willing to try it again maybe was an off day. Customer service bothered me"}
{"text":"As I scroll down and read some of these reviews I laugh because those of you that have experienced a real \"Chicago\" hotdog or italian beef would know that we are the best at it. First if you're looking for just a \"regular\" hotdog go to Teddy's or some place that broils them. I go to Joey's frequently and they are the best hotdog place out here. Living in Chicago all my life then moving out here I have to say it was a hard 3 years trying to find a real chicago dog. I went there yesterday and had an italian beef dipped with hot peppers. Awesome!!"}
{"text":"Went with a group from work.  Ordered the special - beef and sausage and soda.  For $10.03 that is all I got, sliced beef, sausage bun and soda.  Apparently you have ask for anything else like peppers or onions.  Sure with the food server would have mentioned it.  Food was hot, but gosh it was plain."}
{"text":"Took the family out last night, and decided to give Joey's a try. It just recently opened up near the movie theater. 

Wife, the two girls, and myself ordered:
Italian Beef sandwich
Chili Dog w/cheese
Chicken nuggets
Chicken Sandwich
and Fries

The food was just OK, nothing special! I actually liked one of the girls chicken nuggets. Had very good seasoning, liked the taste. Their Italian Beef sandwich was alright. Did not like the gravy, glad I had it on the side. But the peppers, and onions made the sandwich much more appetizing.  Wife's chili dog was alright, they do serve Vienna hot dogs, but I would rather go down the street to Freddie's and have one of their dogs. 
Now Joey's has a Chicago's theme, seems like there is a lot of places like that here in the valley. But their decor just didn't seem authentic, just seemed cheap. The restaurant was clean, workers which was over staffed were very nice and always checking to make sure things were OK. But the smell this place had just wasn't right! The girls complained about it as we walked in, wife also complained. My opinion was it smelled like they boil their hot dogs? But it could also be their gravy. 
Glad we came by and checked this place out. Not sure if we will come back? But who knows!"}
{"text":"We had eaten at the other Joey's and heard that they had another location....loved this place just as much if not better! The service was out of this world! I loved eating here and the atmosphere! The hotdogs are amazing! 

The husband had the fish dog again since he loved it so much the first round. 

Would totally recommend either of the locations, they are both fabulous!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed this restaurant so much that I \"Liked\" it on Facebook! Although we don't live in the area, I recommend them check it out, and if you are passing through Phoenix, defiantly swing by there. 

So this place kind of comes off as \"divey\" but they have an awesome selection of all American food! I wanted a Hotdog, a burger, some sausage, some ribs, a little dessert......UMMM YEAH! It was that good!!! 

A fish dog? Never heard of such!! So, yes I had to try it! It was a breaded piece of fish on a bun with tartar sauce. The only thing that I did add to this combo was a little bit of onions! I also had a side of onion rings which made the fish dog even better! 

The husband had the jumbo chili and cheese dog with a side order of cheese fries. 

This place is great for a snacky type lunch! It was amazing. Loved the atmosphere..loved the food..loved the service! Just might have to make it happen to stop at their other location before we go home!"}
{"text":"Ok, so last night I was feeling a bit lazy and decided to take my nephew and sister out for dinner.  I had visited Joey's once before and had recently received a gift certificate from Tammie, the owner.  So we decided to give Joeys another try. 

 I usually don't like hot dogs but my nephew had the chili cheese hot dog with onion rings and all I have to say is, that hot dog was yummy, fresh, and served hot.  After just one bite my nephew had me convinced that there is nothing better in life than a hot dog with tasty onion rings and a soda.  

My sister had the Italian beef sandwich with cheese.  I have to admit,  I have  always loved a  good cheese steak but I hate getting fatty meat so I'm picky about where I get them, I am pleased to  say, not one bit of fat was on my sisters sandwich. Oh yeah, I love the amount of cheese that was loaded on the sandwich, no skimping there!!!

I went with the fish and chips meal and it was delicious!  The crunchy coating is not greasy, the fish is moist and tasty, and the portion size was enough for two.

My second visit to Joeys was wonderful ...  I will be back again!!"}
{"text":"This place is closed. It would have been nice if that was reported before I drove there. Hot dogs at home it is."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure how Joey's was voted best hot dog in the Valley by readers of Phoenix Magazine. I'll bet George W. was rigging that election too. 

I am a hot dog aficionado so anything decent in a bun would garner a good review from me. Needless to say, I was heartbroken to discover that Joey's was not what I thought it was. 

A couple of my fellow In-n-Out coworkers and I decided to meet up at this restaurant for lunch to \"talk shop\" so to speak. After ordering we attempted to get ketchup. This is a typical waiting for food activity, is it not? And wouldn't one expect to find a plethora of ketchup at a place the sells hot dogs? Well, no. Or at least not accessible ketchup anyways. There was a container with a large bag of ketchup available, but exactly how one was supposed to procure said ketchup still remains a mystery. 

After giving up the ketchup quest, we tried unsuccessfully to find a clean table. \"This would never happen at In-n-Out\" was fighting furiously to escape all of our lips by this point. 

Then our food came out, disappointment ensued. Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal. The taste did not make up for the portioning either. 

TLl;DR: Go to Wienerschnitzel or Costco if you want a hot dog. 


EDIT: I ate at Joey's sometime in January, and there were a total of 3 other customers in the store which doesn't excuse a filthy dining room. 
The ketchup was not empty. There was a large open container of ketchup sitting on the drink station. Since that violates several heath codes in addition to being extremely pointless, I'd say there is no excuse for that either."}
{"text":"firstly, I am not a hot dog eater. I do NOT like hot dogs and I do not eat them often if I do not have to. 

I went to Chicago in 2010 for the first time, tried a Chicago dog at a well known place and was not exactly \"sold\" on them. 

Im driving home a few nights ago, saw this place and thought, I should go try another hot dog (chicago style) and Im craving those \"sport\" peppers. 

My husband and I met there and we walked in and it smelled so good in there. We walk up to the counter and I see they have the REAL Vienna Beef Chicago Dogs with Sport peppers and GREEN Relish. Okay, I will take two, just because. 

We ordered to go and I also bought a jar of the Vienna Beef Sport Peppers to take home. 

We get home, open the dogs, and I take my first bite! WOWSA!!! AWESOME AWESOME!!! I ate the first one and half of the other, as Igot too full to finish and all I can say is we have been back twice since. I am now a hot dog eater.... Only from Joeys though! 

Staff is friendly, atmosphere is clean, and prices are reasonable, if not a little to the high side depending on what you order. 

Warning: Their \"Bag of Fries\" will serve three people! Its huge!"}
{"text":"Been to joeys of Chicago a few times. The food was ok I got the fish and chips which were awesome! The chili dog on the other hand was not great. Small more brown then I am use to dog and the bun was stale. Also not a lot of chili on the dog. If I didn't get the chili dog I would have given 4-5 stars but being this is a hot dog place wanted to have one."}
{"text":"Ordered several items the hamburger was over cooked almost burnt. The turkey sub was just ok. The beef dip the Augu sauce needs more flavor very watery."}
{"text":"Tried the Italian Beef with friends from Chicago and it was awesome!  They also gave it the thumbs up and said that it was some of the best that they have had."}
{"text":"The polish sausages and fries were definitely good. 

However, don't get the regular dogs (I believe the Chicago Dogs?), you might as well make it yourself!"}
{"text":"I saw that this place opened up a little while ago so I was really wanting to switch up from eating the regular ol' burgers and try the italian beef sandwiches. 

The inside is decorated with a lot of memorabilia and pictures, and I thought it was kind of interesting that they had street signs next to all of the tables by the wall. Anyway, the people working here were really nice and suggested some menu items when they saw we were taking our time looking over the menu. I finally chose the Joey's 6\" cheesy beef, wet (meaning they dip it in gravy) - that almost sounds dirty, doesn't it? Well, it was far from that! I got the combo with a side of fries and it was a lot of food...even for me. Plus, you're going to need a lot of napkins with this sandwich.

My overall experience was good, I'd love to come back and do a review update on some of their other menu items - most likely their Chicago dogs...until next time!"}
{"text":"Horrible service took 45 minutes to get our food. Garbage over flowing, tables dirty and the food was not good. Dry Italian beef.  Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"It has been years since I have been here. Last time I was just underwhelmed. This time was great. 

I had the 6 inch Italian beef wet. It was the prefect size even without an additional side. 

The beef was shaved thin and had good flavor. I asked for hot peppers on the side because nothing else was offered. 

The drink $ excessive. $2.29 for a small. 

The place is getting a little run down. Booths are getting worn out. Cleaning could be a little better. IE: wipe everything down not just the tables, napkin holders and beneath them lol. 

Music was good. Staff was ok... there was not much enthusiasm except for the young child who took my order. (No school today)"}
{"text":"Service was poor and so was the food.  Hot dogs are pretty simple - it's just animal byproduct in a tube shape.  Yet these people over charge and under deliver.  It is a family run business and it seems as if they are cutting every corner to make ends meet.  In the end they are being penny wise and pound foolish.

Oh!  And when we voiced our unhappiness to the owner she informed us that she has never heard a bad thing about her restaurant and it must just be us.  Really?  Does she not look at Yelp?  I've seen more than one poor comment on here."}
{"text":"Not much of a hot dog person, but this place gots me singing Hey Joey!  Joey's of Chicago has a couple of locations, but I always attend the North Phoenix one for lunch.  The place is decked out on Chicago sports memorbilia.  I love Michael Jordan!  I admire the man and what little boy during the 80's and 90's didn't want to be like Mike?

I always order the Chicago-Style Hot Dogs here.  When I first ordered it I was a tab bit surprised.  It came with of the fixins' but on top was a pickle!  Needless to say this hot dog was very different, but very good!  Also, topped with peppers, onions, and radishes, this hot dog is well packed and well --- very good ya know!  Served with a side of fries Joey's is a perfect stop for a lunch.  Hot dogs for dinner?  Not in my repertoire!  

Joey's claim to be authentic Chicago style hot dogs.  I've been to Chicago once in my life but never had a hot dog there.  However, I guess I'll have to take their words for it since I'm such a west coast boy.  Overall, experience at this place is never a lost.  It is what it is and Hey Joey is all fine with me! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Ha!  Joey's of Chicago is a total 5 star place to grab a fantastic Italian beef sandwich!  Despite what you may read in a few of the other reviews this place is a reliable 4 to 5 star experience.   You can count on it!  What the heck! who goes to a Chicago  style restaurant that is known for the hotdogs and Italian beef and orders a hamburger??  (Although I heard their hamburgers are burger-licious too)!

This place is locally owned by some very nice folks transplanted from the burbs of Chicago.  At least I know one of them is from Schaumburg, grew up there, at least that's what I heard while eavesdropping :-)  Seriously these folks are from Chicago and they know how to cook some great Chicago style hot dogs and some DELISH hot Italian beef!   It good enough to make to folks at Portillo's proud to have some respectable competition!   

Oh but this not Portillo's, for their Italian beef is a little different but in a good way!  I had their Italian roast beef sandwich with hot peppers covered with melted provolone cheese dry with a side of dip. (Don't call it ausue... Haha, that's what the peeps from Arizona called it.  In Chicago it's simply called dipping sauce :-)  Anyways, my sandwich was DELISH! The folks with me also had the same thing but they had the sandwich dipped and the other got their's wet.  I don't care for soggy bread but they seemed to like it all the same.  

Hungry for a fantastic italian beef sandwich or a super chicago style hotdog Joey's is a great place! It's almost guaranteed you'll meet some other folks from the Chicago area dinning here.  I'm not from Chicago but I travel there all the time and I know you'll have a 4 to 5 star experience.  I hope to see you there!"}
{"text":"We've driven by this place for years and never thought to stop in.  Last week I was craving some Italian beef and didn't feel like driving all the way to my usual go-to beef place down on Shea and 90th St. ....I finally remembered Joey's.  Nice, casual restaurant with counter service.  Chicago memorabilia on the walls and at least one TV that I can remember.  Self-serve soft drinks.  Very nice people behind the counter.  I got a combo meal with an Italian beef topped with provolone and sweet peppers.  Also, added a cup of cheese dip for my fries.  My kid loved the fries and kids burger.  Everything was hot, fresh, and delicious!  Great place!  Gives the other Chicago joints in the Valley a run for their money.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place left us underwhelmed and disappointed. We were very excited to see this place packed!! But once we got our food after about a 20 minute wait, we couldn't see why this place was so busy.  We got the cheese burger special (that doesn't come with fries) and an Italian beef. The burger was burnt!! And the beef left much to be desired, it was dry and was unlike a Portillos-type Italian beef flavor that we are used to being from Chicago. The beef didn't have a good flavor and was dry despite being \"dipped.\" What a waste of money. Do yourself a favor and go to Portillos or lukes of Chicago and skip Joeys!"}
{"text":"Being a fan of Chicago style food I had to go to Joeys when it opened. I usually go to Lukes which is in Scottsdale and figured this had to be the same. Boy was I wrong. 

The hot dogs were very small and the chilli dog had cheese that was ice cold and not even melted on it. The hamburger and fries that my family ordered weren't anything to scream about either. 

I will continue going to Lukes and not Joeys."}
{"text":"First time here and enjoyed it. Nice spot to get a taste of Chi city way out west. They have dogs, Italian beef, and then some other eats for those who may not want to partake. Looks like they cater also."}
{"text":"It was an OK hot dog.  This was the first time I had had a Chicago style dog and I wasn't impressed.  My current work schedule will bring me near here at lunch for a while and I may stop by and get a hot dog loaded my way (mustard, onions, dill relish on a regular bun) to see if my impression changes."}
{"text":"Italian beef is great.  be warned if you get it wet with cheese it's messy!"}
{"text":"Our first family visit to Joey's was great! My 4\" meatball sub was hot, fresh, perfectly spiced and served on a deliciously crunchy roll. The coleslaw was standard but fresh and good paired with the sub. Husband enjoyed his brat. Daughter enjoyed her Chicago dog. My son enjoyed his kids meals with the hot dog and fries. He said Joeys has the best fries in the world and he's not big on hot dogs but that hot dog made him a fan. Everything came out hot within twenty minutes of our arrival, on a Sunday afternoon. And all 5 of us ate for under $40. We'll definitely be back. Good job, Joeys!"}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal..usually get the Italian beef or Chicago red hots...Polish dogs with onions delish....if you catch it on the righr day they have the $1.99 red hot deal. ..today we try their $4.99 cheeseburger. ..very yummy!!"}
{"text":"Underwhelmed would be an understatement. We use to frequent Joey's a couple of years ago but we hadn't been in for a while so we thought we would have some dinner there this evening. It was 6PM and there was one other table with one person in the whole place. The cashier was nice but the look on the cook's face was less than enthusiastic in regards to having to work. My wife ordered a Chili dog and fries, both which were cooked correctly and she enjoyed. I ordered Italian beef and a Sausage sandwich with fried mushrooms. The sausage was so burnt on one side it was inedible, the beef was moderately warm but the sweet peppers tasted \"strange\". My mushrooms were overcooked and the breading was completely burnt.  A few customers trickled in when we were eating so we didn't complain or alert the staff because there was a cashier and one cook. When I finished eating what I could of my meal, my wife went and nicely showed the cashier how our food was cooked. Her response was, \"we would have cooked it again if you told us before you ate some of it.\"  We left it at that, never to return again!

I posted a picture of the sausage and mushrooms as graphic evidence"}
{"text":"We'd been there before for the Italian beef, while decent it definitely didn't knock our socks off. 
Today I wanted a hot dog. Instead I got a chilli dog and was none too happy about it, since it was take out I called to let them know my order was wrong. The guy who answered the phone was a jerk! \"Well I'm looking at your receipt and you ordered chilli dogs\" ....umm I can't dispute that since you DID NOT give me a receipt however I feel like the words \"chilli dog\" and \"Chicago dog\" sound very different.
Anyway on to today's food. GROSS is the only word that I can use to describe it. The fries were soggy and dripping with grease. Like two bites in and immediate heartburn, kind of greasy. My coworker had a burger and it was terrible as well. The beef was dry and had zero flavor. How do you mess up a burger? 
Will definitely not be coming back.

Ps... Went down the road to Freddie's and got a stellar Chicago dog."}
{"text":"LOCATION IS CLOSED!!!! I even went on their website to look at the menu and confirmed address before driving all the way over there."}
{"text":"It's good, but not great.  The Italian beef is tasty, but hardly unique or memorable.  I actually like the sausage better.  Aside from that, it's just another Phoenix place that thinks putting Chicago/New York/etc. in the name and on the walls makes the food interesting."}
{"text":"Well, where do I start? Service is horrible. Owners talked only to the white patrons and completely ignored the non white patrons! Staff are friendly, but the food is mediocre. The polish looks like a miniature version of a polish that you would get from maxwell st. The hotdog was cold! The Italian beef lack in flavor! The fries at McDonald's are better that theirs!!! I won't be coming back! I'd rather drive to scottsdale to get me some portillos!!!"}
{"text":"Was sick for 2 days after eating their polish dog. Upon further research of this place I have learned they got a \"D\" on their last inspection. Gross. Will not be back."}
{"text":"We walked into Joey's of Chicago on a whim on New year's Eve night. Procrastination at it's best, we had been searching for a quick place to eat before going out to celebrate 2011 with drinks but there were very few quality places open.

It was 9:40pm and we came across Joey's. Hoping they were open, we parked and went inside. They WERE open but we were the only ones there, and on top of that, they were closing in 20 minutes. No worries, the staff were AMAZING! They took our order, delivered it to our table, and closed up shop while we ate. There was no rush to finish and they were courteous and smiling as they asked how the quality of the food was.

Obviously the service was top notch, but the FOOD is what really sealed the deal. I don't think I've ever had such an amazing cheeseburger in all of my fast food experience. My boyfriend ordered the Italian Hoagie and I've never seen that guy devour a sub so fast! We did not try to hot dogs, but how could you with such an amazing cheeseburger combo deal? (Cheeseburger, fries, and a drink for $6!).

Overall, Joey's of Chicago has a new raving fan! I'll definitely be back for more :)"}
{"text":"They hit it outta the park tonight.   Split the Chicago beef, wet with hot and sweet peppers, Chicago dog, onion rings and French fries with hubby.   Best food We've had here yet, hands down.  All hot, tasty and fresh!"}
{"text":"Went here on Wednesday for lunch. Was excited to try it due to favorable Yelp reviews and I love \"Chicago Hotdogs.\" Sorry to say, I was disappointed. We arrived about 1:00 pm. There was a long line to order that moved very slow. We placed our order of 1 Chicago dog combo, 1 jumbo dog, 1 dipped beef with sweet peppers. We were given number 73. The other members of our party had number 72. We waited patiently while other numbers were called. When they got to number 72 we expected to be next. Not so. Number 75, 76, etc.... were called but not ours. Finally had to go to the counter and ask where our order was. It ended up they lost the order!! They did make our order immediately. The food was average at best. The beef was nothing special very average. My hot dog was cold. There is no way they could have had that hot dog in the water for more than 30 seconds. Fries had no flavor. I would not return to Joey's and I do believe in giving most restaurants at least three tries in all fairness. Things like losing our order sometimes do happen so I will cut them some slack with that but the food just wasn't that good."}
{"text":"Went in and had a decent wait for one Italian beef sandwich (20+ minutes). Asked for the spicy relish and dipped in the au jus. Got home psych'd to dive in to the sandwich and no relish. Plain jane beef barely dipped. The joint wasn't packed when I was in there so I'm not sure where the disconnect came from. Not sure if going to give them a second chance."}
{"text":"CLOSED!  Tried to go there today and it's gone :(. Sorry to see it go, I enjoyed it. EDIT: Well Yelp says my review is too short...I wish they had a better way is notifying people that a business is out of business.  I really hate to think people are heading to this place hoping for a good meal only to find a closed sign and locked doors.  So, in summary it's CLOSED!!!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.  Tried the Italian Beef and although it's not up to par as some other places, it's fairly good.  Problem is the beef has a strong vegetable taste to it..??..?? and the gravy is a bit salty.  Cheese was melted perfectly.  

Service was very good.  Very attentive staff who took their time and answered all of my questions."}
{"text":"I was raised on food like this in Chicago. I have been searching for a good Italian beef since I moved here a few years ago. While the Italian beef isn't bad it doesn't quite live up to the ones I get back home. However the fact that they have pizza puffs makes me extremely happy and is the reason I keep going back."}
{"text":"Good food food the price. Tried the Italian beef sandwich with sweet peppers...really recommend this sandwich. My lunch guest had their Chicago dog and said it was better than what you would get at the ballpark. The meal came with fries and a drink. I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"So, after a disappointing trip to the Bista deli, which was sadly closed, we ended up at Joey's.

And it was awesome. Chicago styled food, included Italian beef and dogs, sadly, no deep dish, and no gyros.

This is a place where you make your order and pick it up, so those expecting waiter service, not here. 

Their menu is varied, but as I said earlier, I would have loved to have some other Chicago favorites. 

I had the Italian beef, which can come in several ways, \"Wet\", \"Dry\", and \"Dipped\", all of which correspond to Au Jus application, I'm not going to describe them, its self explanatory. However, if you want to go for the \"I'm not going to eat anything else the rest of the day and part of tomorrow\" I recommend getting it \"Joey's\" style, where in a Philly twist, they pour on the molten Cheeze Whiz and Peppers.

The meat was well seasoned, and the jus made it good and messy. The cheese was probably horrible for my body, but delicious.

No liquor license yet, but that doesn't bother me so much, but I just know that once they get beer there, I'll be eating lunch there A LOT.

Fresh fries and the sandwich made for a hearty meal. Come hungry, because for the cost, about 8-10 a person, you get a ton of food.

The only reason this place doesn't get a 5 is because I've had the same things elsewhere, and they don't have gyros or deep dish.

But don't let that discourage you, definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"Husband and I tried Joey's on a Friday evening. We both had the Italian Beef, wet, with mozzarella cheese, mine with sweet peppers. It was good...decent...nothing spectacular. The beef was seasoned well and very tender. We ordered them 'wet' because that's what the sign said they recommend, but personally, I am a fan of au jus, so I should have had it dipped. The fries were thin and crispy. Yum. We will be back, but it probably won't become one of our go-to places."}
{"text":"I Really Like this Place. Their Hot Dogs are always good. One of my favorites here is the cheeseburger. It has a very good taste to it. Also Their fries are coded, whick gives them a good flavor."}
{"text":"Had there \"specialty\" which was the Italian beef. It wasn't bad but I expected it to have much more flavor and it lacked in that department. It was decently portioned and priced but I left not satisfied with the taste. The inside decor of this place is pretty awesome it's a comfortable fun looking atmosphere. I'm going to give it another shot before I make this a no go!"}
{"text":"We went here on a recent Friday night.  Originally, we saw this place when we went to Sticklers and put it on the list.  Well, we couldn't decide where we wanted to go and this popped into our head, so away we went.  Walked in and was impressed, this place was very nice looking on the inside, very clean and some nice Chicago memorabilia giving me some good memories of my time there.   

Ordering - You walk up to the counter and order and then your number is called and you pick it up, so that's easy enough.  The wife and I each got the italian beef sandwich, 'wet' with cheese.  She went w/ mozzarella, while I went with the 'liquid cheddar'.  I got a combo and we shared the fries.  

A big plus about this place was the drink fountain, they had cherry coke, which is the way to my heart.  Unfortunately, the mix seemed a bit off, though it was still good.  The food came out quickly enough.   My first thought was that I was impressed with the amount of fries you got.  There was definitely more than enough for both my wife and myself.  The sandwiches...well, they were ok.  My main complaint is that the meat seemed especially salty.  The cheese was good and the bread was good too.  

Overall I give Joey's three stars.  I think we'll be back and I might try a burger or a meatball sandwich."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why they had bad reviews, I thought that the Italian beef sandwich (wet) was yuimmy.  The sausage was also really good.  The decor was nice and the service was good as well.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I must be back in Chicago on Clark and lake enjoying a delicious Chicago dog.  Music from 97.1fm in the background adds the finishing touch.  If you lived, visited, want to visit Chicago this is a must"}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch and the only thing positive to say was that the service was good and people friendly.  However the food was blah..I had a chicago beef sandwich and the beef didn't have any flavor and was tough.  And I asked for the \"wet version\" which was just au jus on the meat..but it still made the bottom half of my sandwich soggy and the bread then was like glue..ick!  Also the bathrooms smell HORRID!  Like they have a sewer problem.  So, I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Went there with my wife. Neither of us liked our meal. My burger was extremely fatty. I was constantly removing cartilage/fat pieces from my mouth. It was disgusting."}
{"text":"Why have I not stopped here sooner?  This place was great, I ordered the Italian beef per all the great tips on Yelp and that seems what they are famous for.  It lived up to the hype, this location is a good size and very casual with TV inside.  You order like Chipotle and the lunch specials were not to bad (about $10).  I ordered my sandwich with dip on the side with spicey peppers.  Also got the coleslaw to go with it and ate the whole thing."}
{"text":"This place is a little slice of heaven for anyone that has lived in or around Chicago. The Italian beef is very authentic, sliced just right, perfect seasoning, and the buns texture is just right when dipped into the juice. This place used to be Fazoli's and I can tell you that this is the fist time this building has had good food in it. The Chicago dogs are cheap and made exactly to specifications. I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is the most over priced underwhelming food I've had in a long time. I ordered a chili cheese dog for $5. After 15 minutes my dog finally came but had onions. I told the guy I didn't order onions and I said can you scrape it off and put new chili on. He looked at me like \"what's the problem\" and took it back to do as I requested. So now it's been fixed and it's a tiny portion. The hot dog is a small frank and the chili tasted like hormel from the can. It was so small that I could pick it up with my hands and eat it without any mess. The bun was also petrified on one side adding a disgusting crunch. I'll never give another dollar to this place. Gross and overpriced and rude.

Owner emailed me after this review and wanted me to try again. This time I ordered the Italian beef sandwich wet with provolone and some fries. The sandwich and fries were both hot and fresh. I ordered a 6\" and between that and the fries I got pretty full. Probably go with a 4\" next time. An employee actually came to were I was sitting to check if everything was ok while I was eating! That was a nice change from my previous visit. This visit was pleasant and I'm happy to have tried again. Maybe it was an off day the first time I came in. I don't know."}
{"text":"We went here the other day before the Cardinals game to try this place out I go t a recommendation from a co-worker. He went to the one in Cave Creek and said it was pretty good. 

I will start out, the the place is nice and clean and has some cool chicago stuff on the walls. But, it is still the old fazolis place and they didnt change anything really other than some pictures on the walls. 

I had the Itialian beef with cheddar cheese and a hot dog. Where to start... The Italian beef was poor to put it politely. The beef has zero flavor and the bread was not crispy or airy at all.  I ended up just eating the beef out of the the bread because it had cheese on it, I enjoyed the cheese...  Comparing it to other places it was horrible. 

The Hot dog was good. But really how hard is it to grill a hot dog and put some veggies on it... I hate to say it but I would of rather gotten one from the Home Depot hot dog guy than here. They wrapped the dog up in the wax paper and it just condensed all the stuff inside. 

Overall I will not be back and my search for great food is on...."}
{"text":"Took Jr. here the other day for lunch (summer vacation \"dad, I'm bored\").  This was my first trip to Joey's.  

I had a 6\" Italian beef sandwich; \"wet\", with Provolone cheese and hot peppers.   I'm not from Chicago; been there a few times, but I am so NOT an expert on Italian Beef sandwich.   I can only say that I liked Joey's version.  My sandwich was hot and very tasty.  The only complaint about it, was that the hot peppers almost overpowered the beef.  I'm thinking next time I'll get the peppers on the side and add them myself.   The sandwich was packed full of moist beef with a good flavor, and was covered w/ a nice big slice of melted provolone.

My son had a 1/3 pound cheeseburger.  I had to take a \"small\" bite, since I was going to do a Yelp review ;).  The cheeseburger was fresh off the barbecue grill and had good flavor.  Only complaint (from me) was that it was too well done for my liking.

We split a side of fries.  They were fresh out of the fryer, and we liked them.

I wish Yelp would let us give a 1/2 star.  Joey's rated a solid 3 1/2 stars from me.  The staff was friendly and patient while we ordered (you know, the \"first timers\" thing).  The food took a few minutes, but was fresh and hot when it came.  Another big thing (for me) was that the iced tea was fresh.  There are so many restaurants and convenience stores that offer iced tea, but they don't know how to clean their containers out.  Not so w/ Joey's, tea was fresh and very good (China Mist).

We left Joey's full and happy.  We will be back again."}
{"text":"Was back in Arizona, and had to stop back in to Joey's for their Italian beef sandwich (last time I got a couple of their dogs while there and an Italian to go). How is this place not packed? The food is excellent, the prices are excellent, the staff is super friendly, it's clean and comfortable... We went in before seeing a movie around noonish during the holidays. That theater was packed, so the crowds were there. Maybe you guys need to do some type of co-marketing with the movie theater? I hope you guys get more business!!!

--- and to the customer Maria that commented the Italian beef was flavorless - sounds like you ordered it dry without the giardiniera? You need to get it soaked and get the giardiniera."}
{"text":"12/6/12 Update: I am giving Joey's a 1 star upgrade because I was recently contacted by one of the co-owners (Tammie R).  She inquired specifically about what the problems I had encountered so that she could solve them and improve the business.  This kind of customer service is impressive to me.  I wish that I could visit again soon to see if things improve, but for now, an upgrade from 2 to 3 stars."}
{"text":"I lived in Chicago for over 30 years and Joey's does a great job with their Chicago-style food. Really love the fact that they play a Chicago radio station. The restaurant and bathrooms are VERY clean.

I have tried their fries, Italian Beef, Chicago Style Hot Dogs and tamales and everything was great!

If you go to their website and sign up, they alert you about specials and send you coupons.

YUM!! My husband and I eat there whenever we are in the area!"}
{"text":"Very overpriced, beef is too well done, and you have to pay extra for any toppings you want. They are trying with the liquid cheese and the dipped sandwiches but they just fall way short, waaaaay short."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a higher rating but my second visit will now be my last. 

The setup: I walked in with my wife to enjoy some of their fine chicken sandwiches, which we both indulged in on our previous (first) visit to this location about two weeks prior. We also loved the fries and were anxious to have them again. 

The reason I'm not ever going back there? My wife and I stood in front of the empty counter for nearly five minutes. We knew what we wanted and just needed someone to take our money from us. Did that happen? Absolutely not. What did happen? Well, let's see. First one of the guys in the kitchen gave us a dirty look. Then someone else walked right past without making eye contact. Then the heavy-set (guessing manager?) type made eye contact not once but twice and continue to ignore us and go about whatever he was wrestling with in the back. Then another one of the folks in the kitchen gave us \"the look\" and went back to what he was doing, completely ignoring us. 

I should point out that even though this was a weeknight and around 7pm, the place was nearly empty. One person in the drive-thru, two parties seated in the restaurant and one of them already had their food. Understand this clearly in case it isn't obvious from the sentence you just read: There were more employees in the building than customers. Far more. 

I am sorry but I have absolutely no tolerance for service like that, especially when you've made eye contact with the both of us and don't even hint that you'll be right with us, just turn away like we're not there. My wife and I both turned and walked right back out of this place with nobody even noticing we had walked out. 

Get a clue, there's a reason your restaurant is sitting empty while your competitors down the road (one of which we dined at afterwards) were packed. Absolutely not acceptable in the least, you should be ashamed of yourselves for letting repeat customers turn around and walk out of your restaurant after being ignored by pretty much everyone behind the counter. 

Never going back and telling as many people as I can about the experience tonight. What a waste, we really did love the food the first time."}
{"text":"I was out on the west side doing a bunch of stuff yesterday with a friend of mine, and we were hungry by the time we were done.  We aren't all that familiar with this side of town, but thought we would cruise around to see what we could find.  We drove by and saw Joey's, and thought we would stop in and check the place out.

Overall, everything was great.  Joey's is in an old Fazoli's building, and its a great little setup.  We went to the counter and ordered our food, and sat at our table and waited for it to come out.  I went with the 1/3 pound burger with fries and a drink, and my friend went with the polish sausage, fries and a drink as well.  

My burger was awesome! So was my friends sausage, we both enjoyed our meal.  Service was great, and overall, I really enjoyed it here.  Fries were a bit crispy for my liking, but overall food was great and tasted delicious.  If I was on this side of town again, (which is rare for me) I would swing back in and eat here again."}
{"text":"Definitely tasty but I wasn't wowed the way that some people who also wrote reviews were wowed. I ordered a Chicago style dog with no onions and no relish. I love me some mustard and some sport peppers, but I def wish there were more of my fave sport peppers. Price-wise, it isn't too bad at all. Three bucks for the dog and another three bucks if you're digging that combo vibe (fries or other side and a drink). Everything was good, but again, I wasn't in love. 

The service was great and super fast."}
{"text":"Very good food..best Chicagoland food in Surprise.  Very similar menu to Portillos, without the drive!!!  Oh, and Jay's potato chips!!!...I've NEVER seen Jay's chips outside of Chicago before..brought me back to my younger years  in Illinois for sure!"}
{"text":"Joey's sure know how to make some high quality snack food.

Mozzarella sticks? Perfect.
Onion rings? Best I've ever had.

I also had the 1/3 pound burger, and even though there was nothing novel (no special toppings whatsoever) about it, it was above average. I hate ketchup and pickles on burgers, but suddenly they were tolerable. If you're feeling extra hungry, you can upgrade to 1/2 pound or even 2/3 pound for a reasonable price. My burger/sticks/soft drink came out to about $8. Not bad.

Keep in mind, however, that there isn't much variety here. They don't have much, but what they do have is made well. They specialize in hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches. Nothing else seems to boast anything out of the ordinary.

A solid 3.5 stars...would have earned a 4th if they had gyros!"}
{"text":"Good hot dog w/out that overly beefy, burp it up all day long feeling. I had the chilli cheese dog and my wife went with the classic Chicago dog. Both our dogs were good. Not the best ever, but definitely good. 4 stars -will return."}
{"text":"Wow I can't believe how many people think this place is awesome!  I love Vienna hot dogs but that is the only reason this place gets 2 stars is cause they use Vienna beef. The hot dog is never really hot, it seems like it's always sitting in warm water waiting to be ordered. The fries aren't fresh so that gives them no points. They use the crinkle fries. I haven't had anything else there so I can only give you my opinion on the hot dogs. The only thing this has over Luke's is that it's cheaper."}
{"text":"I have never been to chi town and have no idea what a authentic Chicago dog taste like, but if they taste anything like joeys, I'm sold on the city having good Eat. I've had the Chicago style dogs on 9 out of my 10 visits just to get my dawg fix. I tried the 1/3 burger once and enjoyed it, but not enough for me to ever over look the hot dogs. the fries are Yummy. Service can be hit or miss, but I believe it may be from a high turnover in staff. always different face there to greet me. The drink size offered with the combos are a bit small. Kind of annoying to get up for 3 diet refills on a visit."}
{"text":"Well I love a good Italian beef sandwich ! I must say this was the worse Italian beef sandwich I've ever eaten ! Provolone cheese not melted and the gravy was salty ! The peppers were horrible!  The bread wasn't fresh!  First time last, Last time."}
{"text":"This place is really great we ended up taking the kids and they got the hot dogs and I got the burger. I must say that the burger was really good almost as if a taste angel came down and touched the tip of my tongue with this blast of flavor. I will definitely be coming back. Oh yeah they have Mr. Pibb I love that stuff!!"}
{"text":"While the facility is nice and clean, there is little to draw you in.  The food is no better than average ...they can and should do better.  Part of their neon sign outside doesn't work.  What does that tell you?  This location closed several years ago for reasons I don't know, but reopened again recently.  They really need to step it up, or I fear they won't make it again.  There are just too many much better alternatives."}
{"text":"The hot beef is always really good. Hot peppers are really tasty. I always get a side of giardinera which is super flavorful. My only complaint is they have to serve faster. Only 8 tables were full and we waited 20 minutes for 2 hot beefs. No cooking, just putting together. I want this place to make it, get faster."}
{"text":"Good place for a quick bite

Joey's is close to Uptown Alley. We stopped in for a bite while waiting for some lanes to open up. 

Nice enough place with some cool Chicago memorabilia.  Service was quick, Chicago dogs were indeed Chicago style, and they had some nice options for the kids' pallets.  Reasonable prices, as well."}
{"text":"I used to be a manager for Fazoli's -former tenant at this location - which had a big problem with the grease traps, hence, the horrid smell in the bathrooms. JOEY-I can tell you how to fix it for a comped meal-lol

Anyone want some Fazoli's recipes?  Breadsticks- take 16 packaged breadsticks and put on cookie sheet with a high rim, mix 1 cup melted MARGARINE, 7 tablespoons KOSHER SALT (no, not regular salt), 10 tablespoons granulated garlic powder. Pour over breadsticks and bake for 8-10 minutes @325 degrees, Yes, they will be swimming in a puddle of margarine."}
{"text":"Standard Vienna Beef Chicago dogs, and Italian beef. The dogs are now price-reduced to $1.99 permanently rather than the price on the menu, according to the sign in the window. 

Dogs are good, place is nice & clean. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable.

Onion rings and cheese fries are excellent. Vienna beef dogs. They also have FIRE DOGS, but you wouldn't know it from the menu. I didn't find out until after I ordered. Oh well, definitely next time.

You can also buy an assortment of Vienna beef condiments, that are almost impossible to find except online (the neon relish, sport peppers, etc.)

They have a Chicago classic rock radio station (97.1) playing on the audio system, and a nice, well-adjusted Samsung HDTV flat screen (probably 50\") in case there is a game on."}
{"text":"Joey's is Da Bomb! 

I was in Cave Creek earlier this week for a Yoga Class and noticed Joey's of Chicago in the same plaza. Having liked the food at their Happy Valley location we had to give this one a try too!

We ordered hot dogs with everything, fries and onion rings. Everything was great and satisfied that craving we get once in a while for a good Chicago-style hot dog. 

So if you're from Chicago or like Chicago-style dogs Joey's is the place."}
{"text":"I said we'd be back and we have been. Whenever my partner and I are craving true Chicago Hot Dogs we head over to Joey's.

When you walk in the door you're greeted with the sounds of 97.1 The Drive - a Chicago Classic Rock station. They say they play the soundtrack of our lives which is absolutely true, for may anyway.

Step up to the counter and you have your choice of dogs Chicago style or Jumbo, go for the jumbo. Or you can order an Italian Beef, just the way you like. Today I went for the hot dog while my partner ordered the Italian Beef. We shared a bag of fries. Both were delicious. 

For a place that averages just over three stars, Joey's was sure busy on Sunday afternoon. Almost packed at nearly 2:00 PM. That alone must say something about their food. 

Best of all the prices are very reasonable. So if you want a true Chicago dog (the only type you should want) you can't go wrong with Joey's!"}
{"text":"It always makes me nervous when a place is very empty (one couple in the whole place) at lunch time, but it was a Monday.  The Staff was very friendly and accommodating, but when I asked to sub onion rings for French Frys, they were OUT at that location.....  But they did suggest their deep fried mushrooms, which were good.   Bottom line, it was decent and very affordable, and I would eat there again if shopping near by, but would not make a special trip."}
{"text":"We waited FORTY MINUTES.  It's a hot dog joint.  I've never waited 40 minutes at any takeout place.  How the hell do you take 40 minutes to make:

1 Beef Sandwich
1 Combo
1 Chili Dog
1 Bag of Fries
2 Chocolate Shakes

And...  Not once did they apologize for the wait or (and this is scary) even ACKNOWLEDGE that the wait was anything out of the ordinary.

It's sad really.  They're close to our house, and being Chicago transplants, it would be nice to have a good Vienna hot dog place nearby.  Oh, that reminds me - they tout that they serve Vienna hot dogs, but the chili dog didn't taste like a Vienna dog to me.  Did I mention that they also screwed up the order turning the combo into a beef sandwich?  Dead to me."}
{"text":"Today for lunch my buddy asked if I wanted to go to Joey's and I actually thought an Italian Beef sounded good so I went along to try this place out.  After having real Italian Beef from Portillo's in Chicago and their location in California I was hoping for something close.  They were the closest I've had here in Arizona.  You can order it dunked (self explanitory) wet (a ladle full of juice poured over it, or dry (no juice).  I got sweet and hot peppers on mine and got it wet.  Great lunch was a bit pricey though so that's why I don't give them a full 5 stars.  $10 for a sandwich and drink was a bit much IMO.  If you go only get the Italian Beef as the rest of the stuff didn't seem too appealing."}
{"text":"The food and service is good. Nice selection of sandwich's and salads.  The only complaint is that when they run out of something to let the person know at the register know so it isn't a surprise when you get your food.  Otherwise I would have given them 5 stars."}
{"text":"CHILI DOGS!!!  I get a chili dog every time I'm near this place!  I love 'em.  I'm not a hot dog connoisseur (and I probably wouldn't admit it if I was) but this place has good dogs.  Good Chili Dogs too!  Every eat a chili dog at Sonic?  THIS IS NOT A SONIC DOG!  THANK G!!!  This is good stuff!

My wife usually gets the Chicago dog and loves it.  My son loves the Italian Sausage here.  I'm just stuck on the chili d's.  :-)"}
{"text":"Joey's had a neat atmosphere, and okay food.

The ordering process seemed needlessly long considering the few people there, i would hate to see how backed up the line gets when it's super busy.

The italian beef sandwich is basically a french dip -- don't let any overly gung ho chicagoan try to tell you otherwise.  They recommend 'dipped' where they put the whole sandwhich in the sauce, and it's likely because the bread they use is pretty dry.  I ordered my sauce on the side for dipping, and the bread was falling apart a little bit as i tried to maneuver it into the cup of tasty but watery sauce.  

Whatever I had as a side was totally unmemorable, and the amount of time I waited for them to slap precooked meat on a presliced roll was not appropriate, considering the customer load at the time.

2.75 generously rounded up."}
{"text":"If you love Chicago Vienna beef hotdogs this is the place :-) super cute deli style interior, friendly staff, flat screen tvs and neon signs make for a great dining on the go experience."}
{"text":"Being from Chicago, I want to love this place.  But it was just okay....

I just had a hot dog, which was decent.

I ordered a bottle of water, got rang up and paid, and then was told that they were out of water bottles.  What?  Who runs out of bottles of water?  Drive down to Wal-mart and buy a few cases!  So instead they offered me a gigantic cup for pop.  Yuck.  I didn't want soda, I wanted water.

I'm not sure if I'll be rushing back here any time soon."}
{"text":"I've had Italian beef in Chicago. This is the real deal. They serve Vienna Beef hotdogs too, so they are serious.
This place is clean. Friendly staff!
Always enjoy going in!"}
{"text":"Same great food and better service! The ladies working today were nice, friendly and helpful and our food came out quickly. So glad I gave this place another chance! My father wants to come here every time he visits me now."}
{"text":"I only get the italian beef , It's solid always good."}
{"text":"As an Italian Born and raised in the Chicago area I was anxious to check it out. I are arrived about an hour before closing and the only customer the entire time.
I placed a carry out order of 3 Italian Beef sandwiches with the beef stock, and roasted peppers on the side. I also ordered 3 orders of potatoes, slaw and salad. Paid close to $60 and took it home. What a disappointment. All they gave me was the sandwiches and plain salad. Everything else was missing.
I'm not hard to please and if the place was packed and the employees pressured I would of gave them the benefit of the doubt.
I specifically sent an email to their  upper management but was never contacted. I'll never go back."}
{"text":"I love Chicago dogs.  This one was ok.  a bit cold though but flavor was just ok"}
{"text":"Friendly service.

Ribs were taken from refrigerator and put on grill to reheat. I would have preferred them to be fresher from a BBQ restaurant.  They tasted okay though.  The sauce was spicy as the default sauce, so be prepared for that. I was not, but they were still edible at the spice level.

The fries were not that great.  Soggy and wilted.

Prices are pretty high here. I only go when there is one of those Deal Site deals so I can afford it.  I would expect a wider range of pricing, especially for lunch time."}
{"text":"I'm upgrading Joey's from 4 stars to 5.  My reasons are myriad:

-The service is always exceptional. This is not hyperbole, go there and you'll see for yourself.

-They are going the extra mile to provide value, and then some.  From their deep discounts frequently available through the Groupon/Deal Chicken type resellers, Facebook/Email/SMS fan club to their discount stamp card that they'll combine with their other offers

-They are going the extra mile to improve the quality food.  They recently invited those in their SMS/email fan club to a taste test of many new products they were considering, allowing their patrons to choose the products they serve.

Oh, and the firedogs are a new favorite.  Totally an addiction at the moment."}
{"text":"This location is just as great as the one on Bell road.  You can find my review here:

{"text":"Outstanding service here - polite, quick, friendly, and followed up at the table to make sure everything is alright (and this is \"fast food\").  Fries were delicious.  Looks like some good fried apps options."}
{"text":"$12.25 + tax for a single 8\" sausage?!?!?!?!
Not again.
Mural was cool, but with all the sur-charges for everything, I was sure they were going to charge for air if I stayed any longer."}
