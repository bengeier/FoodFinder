{"text":"Great dive-y atmosphere, excellent beer list, engaging staff. If you are trying to find a chill experience in the east end, add The Only to your list!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: The cafe has a cozy feel and somewhat resembles an Indian-dwelling-gone-wild. This is mainly because of old couches or armchairs abundantly covered with all sorts of colourful pillows. The amount and spectrum of art pieces on the walls keeps ADHD-prone folks busy for a while.    Product and Service: The baristas are sweet and chatty. The coffee art nicely compliments the affordably-priced beverages. Mochachinos (the only drink I tried), caffe lattes, and macchiatos are $3.33 for a regular sized cup.  Overall: I wouldn't recommend the mochachino per se. However, the coffee shop is worth a visit, especially if you have the Indie Coffee Passport (http://www.indiecoffeepassport.com/)"}
{"text":"Once again \"The One in the Only\" does it so well. Although there were a number of people in line, the barista taking the orders was chatting everyone up and making jokes, obviously in a really good mood and happy to spread it around. He paid attention to what each person wanted, and kept up a steady stream of observations and comments that made the wait time for the drinks go really quickly. The barista actually making most of the beverages was efficient and smooth, seamlessly stepping in to take orders when necessary.  The Indie Coffee Passport is almost over [8 more days, but who's counting ... sigh] and they were very generous to offer me pretty much anything on the menu. I asked for a small decaf latte, but it certainly was not 'small'. It was creamy, distinctively bold - not always true of a decaf - and warmly welcome on this slightly chilly spring day. I enjoyed a few minutes of conversation with one of the regulars at the counter, and then, latte in hand, stepped back out into the sunshine a little happier for having stopped by."}
{"text":"Used to love coming to this place, great beer selection, but going down hill. The beer selection used to make up for some of the servers, but luckily there are many better establishments now open in the East end, with good beer and hospitality."}
{"text":"I love this place, Constantly changing Taps are amazing, seriously 24 Micro Brews and Craft Brews, a Gravity Cask, and easily hundreds more in the Fridges! Staff is Fun and Friendly, the Patio is perfect, and it's always a great time.  Expect my return."}
{"text":"Consistently great, kind service and I do love their Americano ;) Really great place to have in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"My favourite coffee shop to work at. Friendly baristas and amazing indie feel! Their drinks a pretty decent too."}
{"text":"Great patio, Excellent selection of craft beers and liquor. Cheap drinks and good fun! I love the laid back hipster atmosphere of this place."}
{"text":"Now, you may be asking... is it really the only cafe? Well, no, but it definitely is one of the best! A friend of mine who will remain nameless caught wind of a cafe in town which served our kind of beer at really-really-ridiculously cheap prices. We knew we couldn't let that information just slide, so we went to check it out. Turns out, the Only is probably one of the best places in the city to enjoy imported beer. At these prices, you're practically STEALING. Wonderful experience which was enhanced by the amazing atmosphere and chill clientele. I had such a great time, I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Despite the \"attitude\" the servers have, I like this place. I feel like this is the place to come if you're young, broke and awesome but I've also seen people of all ages having a good time here. The coffee is mind blowing and the beer selection is impressive. They even let us sample some to make sure we ended up with a pint that we would like. Could be a little bit cleaner... but then it would lose its edge."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and LOVE the coffee. The staff is really nice and the atmosphere is really chill. It's a great place to meet friends, and a perfect place to study."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood bar on the Danforth, with an excellent beer selection and good staff. The real downside is that they don't have any food options. They are fine with you taking in food from one of the restaurants across the street, though. I'm not sure if they have some deal with them, or if they are fine with any outside food coming in, but if you want good drinking fast-food I'd recommend hitting Square Boy down the street before (and after) here. This place is for drinking and hanging out, and occasionally live music as well.  During the day I think it's a cafe? I've never been before dark myself..."}
{"text":"Great little dive bar to grab drinks with friends. Excellent beer selection. It was pretty busy but grabbed a spot at the bar for after work drinks on a Thursday."}
{"text":"This review only covers brunch.  I could see that there is a great beer selection but I couldn't stomach a drink after too many the night before.  The brunch menu had some tasty options like huevos rancheros, a breakfast wrap, eggs benedict etc. but I was put off by the general filth and relatively small breakfasts.  The coffee mugs are an assortment of stained old mugs, the sugar jar had a year of dust and grime on the top of it and the tables looked like the walls - partially stained and spotty.  The food itself tasted fine, the sausage and eggs came with one sausage, a small scoop of potatoes and two eggs.  This would be fine for $3.99 but it was $5.99 which sounds like the price of two beers here or even worse 6 ice teas according to Kat F.  To top it off I'm convinced there is cinnamon in their coffee.  If not it was something from the dirty mug.  Stick to the beer."}
{"text":"Really fantastic service,  especially given the perpetually crowded nature of the place. The promptness of service and the friendliness are unbeatable. Having been unable to make up my mind, I was allowed to sample a few different beers. Very kind, and I didn't even ask, just found myself with a small taster of a few beers in question!   The beer selection is mind blowing.   The crowd is noisy, young and having fun.   The seating is mismatched and limited- it is part of the fun, but one often ends up at the bar. It is very exciting to land a 2 person small table up against the wall.  If you haven't been, just go. It is in a league of it's own."}
{"text":"Dropped by the only today for a bite at lunch time with my husband. I haven't been in years and was happy to see it still had it's laid back atmosphere and cool music. We ordered  coffee and two sandwiches... the coffee arrived promptly but then we waited for more than 45 minutes for our sandwiches.. which never came. We asked for our money back and left. They didn't comp the coffee for our trouble. Not going back."}
{"text":"Best bar in the city, hands down! Huge beer selection, killer patio, cool patrons and even cooler staff. What else do you need?!"}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection, including some high end selections that aren't easily found elsewhere. Service was friendly, but didn't make a lasting impression (bar service only, efficient and friendly without any special touches which I don't really feel are needed at a place like this). The patio was busy, but perfect for carrying on a conversation and soaking in a nice day. Awesome casual spot for the discerning beer drinker."}
{"text":"I adore this place. Don't let \"cafe\" fool you, their beer is what you should be going for. My personal favourite is the apricot beer - can't get that everywhere!  The atmosphere is very cozy, very laid-back, and if you're there for some nice weather, hit up the patio in the back! It's wonderful, and you don't get that \"creepy\" vibe from anyone.   The waiters are awesome - super friendly, very helpful, always checking up on you.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"This place gets dumb slammed. Went here on a Fri around 12:30am and oh Lordy. I get the appeal: a large beer selection, nice ambiance, and cool staff (one even returned a 10$ that we had unknowingly dropped when switching tables). If you can get yourself a decent seat you're set (which we happened upon via perfect timing), but I don't envy the many shoulder to shoulder standers. They had some board games on the wall which is always a nice touch. (One word one number: Connect 4.)   I heard this is the only cafe, which makes it pretty unique, so check it out I guess."}
{"text":"Its hard to review an establishment of such stature and successful longevity. These things pretty well speak for themselves. Hell, this Pub has a song written about it that concretely places it within Canadian culture. Lowest of the Lows \"Just about 'The Only' Blues\".  The first thing that strikes you about the place is the warmth that only comes from a space that has been lived in and experienced. Visual texture is everywhere.  Reproductions of great art in aged frames, historical concert posters and bric-a-brac hang on every inch of wall space. Postcards plaster the beer fridge. Hand written chalkboard beer list. A library of board games and a pinball machine in a far back corner nook.  All this bathed in the warm glow of light emitted from an eclectic smattering of small table lamps. It brings me back to my art school, record listening youth.   They key attraction is of course the wide selection of Ontario and Quebec beers on tap and an international selection of choice beers from around the world in bottles.  This constantly changing menu of beers is part of the excitement of each returning visit. What will I try today? Samples are free,  within reason, so no worries to committing to a full pint of something you may hate. That and the staff are well versed on all their beers,  and they are a willing group to get you what you want.  The crowd of patrons that frequent The Only is very diverse and always engaging.  I've gone here alone and in groups often to find myself involved in a completely random conversation within a short time. Always intriguing and socially satisfying. Never a dull moment.   The Only food service is limited to panini style sandwiches that are really good. No worries here though, food option are close by. Take out,  even delivery, is welcome. There is some great local fair to be had close by. Pizza, fried chicken,  all day dim sum and Caribbean,  even a 7-11, all within steps. In addition to this is a coffee and tea extension, The Only Within the Only, accessible from the street,  from within the Pub and from the massive back patio.  Nuff said,  The Only is more than just an East side gem. It's a Toronto gem. Visit and enjoy."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood bar. The type of place you could grab a beer and read a book (if you're there early enough)  They have a lot of \"regulars\""}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite haunts in the city. It has a certain musk to it that while foul, it is almost charming. Almost.   The beer selection is unmatched by most bars in the city and the tap handles are always rotating which is nice for the non-loyal beer drinker.   The clientele is eclectic and eccentric. Old and young, hip and introverted. There is a crew that plays Magic Cards in the back that are interesting to say the least.   Bartenders control the music and they usually play pretty rad shit. Lots of great old school hip hop and solid 90s rock. Also, the buzzing of the jager machine helps tune out the voices in my head which is a huge bonus."}
{"text":"Awesome selection of beers that is constantly rotating.  Every week I check out their website to see what's new on tap in case I want to go get a pint of something.  When the patio isn't open I suggest getting there early if you want a seat because this place is popular.  Sundays are $5 pint days and the rest of the week it'll cost you $7.  Another plus is you're allowed to bring in take out from anywhere to enjoy with your beers!"}
{"text":"This is not the place you take your Mom who grew up in Europe.  Bur it is a hell of a beer-honoring institution with large glass fridges of bottles, and 24 beers on tap plus a cask. Nearly all craft beer, and for today's prices it better be. Used  to be so cheap, now it's just reasonable and a cool place to stop by. The place does well and draws a mixed crowd of student travellers, hoary regulars, and just weird off beat and off kilter miscellanea as well as a smattering of hard core beer geeks.  Back patio very usable, has smoking though. They have grill press sandwiches and some brunch type things like waffles to get you through as well. They will let you bring in your takeout if you are only coming to drink. Hundreds of picture litter the walls. It's dusty and has an odd smell like old sweat & chewing gum but The Only is my local."}
{"text":"Be very careful here they sell different size pours of draft. The bartender tried to rip me off and didn't think i would notice. Younger guy, black beard. Tried to charge me for 4 Pints but was pouring 400ml drafts and wasn't even ringing anything in. Asked for the bill and just screamed across bar what I owed. He's stealing off the owners. Quite the little racket he's got going there.  Didn't print me a bill  How much are you pocketing every night?"}
{"text":"Best time I've had in Toronto since I got here a few years ago. Really cool place to hang out. This was the fourth stop on the Toronto Beer Week Pub Crawl recently and I will definitely return !  It was great weather the day I went so we stayed out on the back patio.  When we first got there we chatted up the bartender to get an opinion on beer selections and he let us try a few samples. Very friendly staff, good selection of beers and a great vibe.  Overall awesome choice."}
{"text":"So I recently moved to the Danforth area. No, not the trendoid, yoga-mat-toting, Big Carrot-shopping organo-mom zone between Broadview and Chester.  And not the Souvlaki-til-you-drop zone of packed (yet mediocre) Hellenic spots between Chester and Pape either. Nope, this is the Danforth at Jones avenue, east of all that claptrap.   It is a slightly dumpy part of the street that's home to a melange of Greek, Ethiopian and Indo-muslim shops, restaurants, and even a large mosque. It's charm is in its diversity, and in the low key surprises you stumble upon . . .such as the Only Cafe!  You enter to a dark but personality-filled room (actually two if you include the 'One in the Only' cafe next door) jammed with rickety tables, mismatched mugs and cutlery and a whole mess of prints on nearly every square inch of wall.   There is no separate kitchen, just a high bar behind which the staff cook simple breakfast and lunch fare, around the two giant coolers with a better bottled beer selection than you'd find at most LCBOs.  The staff are friendly, and include a fiesty 4'11'' white-haired firebrand, who dances to the 60s soul tunes they pump out there, when she thinks she's hidden behind the counter.  The clientele is always interesting, and includes a good number of what I would describe as \"working class boys\" from the neighbourhood. Mostly white and ball-capped, they are loud and sometimes drunk at suspiciously early times. But they are harmless and give the place a bit of down to earthiness missing from so many hipster and artist infected joints in this town.  Having only sampled the breakfast I will speak on its behalf: It's damn good! Nothing fancy here (despite references on the Only's outdated website menu to stuffed banana-bread French toast, such an item does not exist) but good, ample without being ridiculous, servings of classics done well.   Belgian waffles are that perfect blend of fluffy and crisp, sprinkled with powdered sugar and surved with a mound of actually quality fruit (kiwi, berries, honeydew among them). The fact that they're made in an antique looking all-cast iron waffle press balanced precariously on the edge of the bar adds to the allure. Thumbs up!  French toast, served with the same fruit as the waffles, includes four wedges of melt-in-you-mouth eggy bread, without the metallic taste that sometimes clings to lesser attempts. The sausage it came with was ordinary but plump and good. Extra points for syrup served in an old pop-top Grolsch beer bottle.  Breakfast burrito (elsewhere panned on this page) was the least impressive of the item I've tried. The burrito is actually not really the focus of the plate, taking up a scant one quarter of the plate. It was tasty though with the spinach and scrambled eggs inside a different experience. And it comes with a big side of tortilla chips, bean dip and a salsa that I thought was quite passable.   Other dishes such as Cowboy and Cowgirl breakfasts are variations on the two eggs, toast, ham or sausage and homefries. I have only eaten this of others plates (I'm terrible at saying no!) but have witnessed properly prepared eggs, and good, well-seasoned and slightly charred homefries. None of that bag to deep fryer crap some places get away with.  Oh how could I forget -- the coffee is good too. The shop next door uses Mercury Coffee beans, and I think the same are used at the Only.  All adds up to a pretty decent place to recover on a Saturday or Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Years have past since I've been to The Only Cafe, but after having had the opportunity to step in the other day I was glad to see the place still oozed the charm of my earlier visits. If you are looking for a somewhat hip, down-to-earth, local cafe/pub this is perhaps one of your best bets. Unless that is you are some kinda business professional looking for something corporate and sterile, to which there are plenty of Starbucks around for you to bask in.  The Only Cafe is actually two establishments in one, cafe and pub, separated by a wall. You crossover to either side via a magic drape located near the back. On one side you have a comfortable and cozy cafe with a fair amount of seating. They serve up coffee, tea and various munchable treats. Only one blend of regular coffee available but it's super yummy. Espresso based drinks go without saying. The prices are quite reasonable and the staff are friendly.   Cross over to the other side you'll find a small pub kinda reminiscent of bars along Queen St. W. back in the late 80's early 90's. 70's rock plays over the music system as people hang out and sip their beer of choice. To note, I think The Only Cafe is one of the few places you can get a Black 'N Tan beer in one of those jug like bottles. Kewl. The prices again are reasonable and there is a good selection of beer and spirits, just don't come here looking for some rare Speyside scotch.    Perhaps some of The Only's charm comes from the lack of it in this neck of the Toronto woods. The place stands out like a water hole in a desert. But I think the place stands on it's merits in comparison to other pubs and cafe's. I recommend if you are in the area. Here's a tip: The Only Cafe is part of that Indie Coffee Passport thingy where you can get up to a $5 drink at 24 cafes' across Toronto for $25 up front."}
{"text":"great place to come and relax. every time I'm here I feel at ease. the staff are friendly and solid people it seems. they hug each other. i get the vibe here and i appreciate it. nice that it's hinged to the backpacker crowd, separated by curtains. my only complaint would be that the music is too loud and wouldn't mind it turned down a couple notches."}
{"text":"FatCat have strategy for everything in life. Thats why FatCat so successful. Bar hopping is not exception. FatCat call this strategy \"Danforth Tri-Fecta of Bliss\".  Check this!   1. Get to The Only early and get good seat. BIG patio in the back in summer.. puuurrrr...  2. Have some drinks with good friends until hungry.   3. Run down to Danforth pizza and order pizza with favorite toppings. (also see FatCat review for Danforth pizza)  4. Wait 40 minutes.  5. Bring pizza into Only and enjoy with friends (Mr Owner so nice he not care if you bring food in)   But you thinking \"wait FatCat, Tri-Fecta need 3 things, not 2??\"  Aaaahhh.. Yes..  FatCat not finished yet... Continue  6. You drink much more at Only (because soooo many good beer on tap all times)  7. You forget you already eat pizza because you drink so much.  8. You run across street from pizza store to square boy to get Gyro on bun with fries + gravy, and bring back to Only to eat again. (FatCat also review Square boy)  9. You go home feeling like king. Not worry about tomorrow. Someone else will deal with problems tomorrow.  But you thinking \"FatCat, why you call this bar hopping when you only go to one bar.\"  FatCat tell you...   FatCat hop to same bar 3 times in one nite. So FatCat call this bar hopping.  SIDE STORY: FatCat learn to say \"Check this!\" from hip-hop friend. Hip-hop friend always add swear word at end, but FatCat not roll like that (also learn \"roll like that\" from hip-hop friend). FatCat tell you more about Hip-hop Friend in another post."}
{"text":"Went for coffee in the evening. Coffee was great and reasonably priced. The reason why this is 5 stars for me is because there was an AMAZING jazz band and tap dancers performing. It made the experience very enjoyable. I hope to try the bar side next time I go."}
{"text":"With plaid in hand I schlepped my way through Greek town to find this quirky pub/cafe. After parking my car (with ease might I add) I navigated my way through the 2 feet of space between the bar and the wall o' patrons that flanked the busy bar.   I discovered my compatriots to the rear and found a nearby chair to deposit myself. While this was not a frenzied search, I did however highly regret the giant purse I had on my person, as I indelicately knocked tables, lamps and fellow yelpers in my quest for a seat.   I was struck by all the famous art-inspired paintings covering the walls, oh and the passing people making their way to the over-sized patio to...breath in, and out as it were. Making my way to the bar was another trek through the maze of people and chairs, but I was happy to discover a true artist of customer service.   I am not a regular beer drinker, so when I come to a pub known for their on-tap fare I am a little lost. The delightful bar baroness poured me a couple of samples and started me a tab...get this...without a credit card necessary.   As a proponent of continued customer service I added a star to this review, normally this would stand as a true three star establishment in my books. Loud, uncomfortably crowded, and touting furniture older than my grandmother I might have written it off if not for the pleasant staff experience. Bottom line...get ready for bountiful brews and tight quarters, so make sure you bring a friend."}
{"text":"One of the best & cheapest bars on the Danforth. Can't go wrong with $7 pints of Ontario Craft beer.  All the bartenders are very knowledgeable about the beers they are serving. You can even order a pizza next door and have it delivered to you while you are enjoying a pint. Only downside is that it is very small and cramped and they close the café side early, however the spacious back patio makes up for it."}
{"text":"I want to update on this place BECAUSE I LOVE IT. The service: always friendly. Clientele: same. Drinks: delish."}
{"text":"Forgot to leave my review after the awesome plaid event!  I used to live just down the street from The Only Cafe, but never once went in for a drink. This was primarily because The Only is inconveniently located on the Danforth, east of Pape--an area that's a little sketchy once the sun goes down (and also while the sun is up). But for Yelp, I braved the 30 second trek from Donlands station. And so glad I did!  Turns out The Only is a cozy little pub with an excellent selection of beer. \"Cozy\" and \"little\" might be understatements, actually. This place is TINY! I arrived just after 9pm and almost didn't get a seat. The seat I did get had obviously seen better days and the springs and stuffing were poking out the top. A little dirty, a little scuzzy, but the decor wasn't all bad -- lots of artsy stuff on the wall to look at, including a painting print of a naked lady that I got to sit across from. Boobs and beer make a fine combo on a Friday night.  Which brings me to the beer. I'm not really a beer drinker, but when I saw the variety of bottles and cans peeking out at me from the fridge what other choice did I have? I hate making barmaids repeat the beers the have on tap and I choose my beer based on the label/can design so this was perfect for me.  Music was loud so it was tough to hold a conversation, but this didn't really matter. . . because they played Joy Division like all night long! Very nice.  My advice would be to avoid the area altogether, but if you simply must hit up a pub in this neighborhood, hit up The Only. I probably wouldn't go back on my own, but if there was another UYE there I probably wouldn't hesitate to attend."}
{"text":"A personal favourite. Overflowing with charm, history, 90s indie rock, and at times customers! Gets full because people know a good thing."}
{"text":"Very cute atmosphere! Also the Cowgirl Breakfast was delish. Went here for brunch, service was lovely, bartender knew what was what. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Lots of beers. I had the smoked porter from somewhere.... haha, im a little fuzzy on the details. Seems like a good spot, about 15 beers on tap and many many more in bottle. Was very busy on a Tuesday Night."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoy The Only Café. The customer service can be hit or miss, but I luck out more often than not. Ugh, hipsters, am I right??  Their coffee and beer selections are pretty awesome and they have a lot on tap, and the overall atmosphere is great! Sometimes I spend the day in the cafe working only to end up at the bar on the other side or the sweet patio put back all night. Sometimes, if you're lucky, the racoon will run under the benches out back and send people running, so you can snag their spot!   They have a decent food menu, but you can also bring outside food if you prefer something different.   Right at Donlands station, so you can TTC and they have lots of bike parking so you can ride come summer!"}
{"text":"A little dirt never hurt.   Though this was a cleansing stop on the Dirty Danforth pub crawl, I've actually been here quite a few times, so don't think of it as necessarily dirty.   This is a local hangout. It's not trying to win any awards but it certainly can be proud of a cheap menu, massive beer selection (two overflowing fridges) and I think its WTF-bohemian style is really something to see.   In addition to the beer, there's solid live music, pinball, board games plus knowledgeable and friendly staff to boot. That's a winning combo that keeps me coming back.   So, if you're in the east end and you're at all adventurous, don't be afraid to give The Only a try. Just bring a wet nap."}
{"text":"Hadn't been here in a while since we left the area, so we were definitely looking forward to coming back.  Have to say I was very disappointed.   Beer selection in the fridge is maybe a third of what it once was.  The taps weren't much better, still a vast selection but many that seemed too similar.  My biggest issue was the bathroom.  Absolutely spotless, I'm not even sure how they kept it that clean for a whole evening, but the stench of bleach was overbearing and lingered in my nose as if I snorted it.  Toss in too many hipsters who make no effort to get out of your way when walking through and I'm surprised I gave it a three.    The place is as busy as always, so they won't miss my business, and I won't miss theirs."}
{"text":"I used to come to this place like 10 years ago and every so often now and wow, this place has barely changed. It is still the same divey, low-key locale. Except for the laptop hobos, but then again, they are EVERYWHERE. Also if you come during the day, you are likely to find a mother reading a book with a baby stroller which can be a bit odd given the surroundings.     They used to have poetry nights and I used to come here to chill and be all creative, with my cup of joe, a cig, a pen and a black book to write my like-you, like-seriously-deep thoughts, man. In fact I was thinking of coming here to do my first poetry riffing... however I never made it. Free Times Cafe was the one that got that distinction/pleasure/bad luck :-P   They still do something akin to it but it is now called 'The Draft,' however I have not attended one yet, although they are now on their 7 season, so you just know that is something you may want to check out if you are into your underground literary scene.    They are still a mix between a divey bar with a cafe so you get to pick and choose just exactly how you want to stimulate/kill-neuron-cells in your brain, which you must admit is a good attempt on their part.   Why did I stop coming so many years ago? I came one night to hear some poetry and unbeknownst  to me, they were hosting a J.R.R. Tolkien poetry night and I must admit, I have never been a fan of hobbit-inspired acrostic poetry in septets.   But if you live in the hood, it is a cool place to check out and have a beer."}
{"text":"I don't drink beer but they have a very very extensive beer selection. So my beer loving friends love coming to this little place on the Danforth. I really enjoy the atmosphere and the other patrons as well.   One friend hosted a sub-crawl: a pub crawl via the subway, get off at one stop, find a dive, have a drink. Get back on the subway go one stop and repeat! The Only Cafe was one of the stops on this tour and compared to the other \"really\" dive bars we were at, I found the Only to be one of our better stops! I don't consider it to be a dive.   I would say the prices are fair."}
{"text":"man, I forgot to review this place! but here it is.  so it's a dark bar adjoined with the one and the only cafe. it seems to have a patio area (that would maybe fit 2 chairs? haha=) in the summer. and there are maybe 10 tables inside with a long bar sitting area.  they have a cool booklet with the list of all( or maybe it's not even all but just the most amazing ones?) the beer they serve. most of them have a description of flavors and such, some only have names listed along with logo and brewery name.   I, of course, got lost in the amount of possible choices and went up to the bar to ask for a suggestion of something light and unusual. the bartender lady immediately came up with two options and gave me two sample shot glasses to taste both! how amazing is that?=) so I had 2 shots of beer. one of which I fell in love with haha=)   I never knew maple beer existed now i know and its name is Erable and I will come back to have it again.  Great service. Great beer selection.  pretty awesome place in a nutshell."}
{"text":"I love all of the options that they have on tap, the atmosphere is really cool, they played classic rock when I was there and you get to hang out with tourists from other countries.  All in all its a good break from all of the other tired out old places.  Just don't expect to play pool here that and the servers run away before you can tip them."}
{"text":"The Only is the epitome of Toronto's east-end bar scene. It's been around for a while, and it holds a perfect balance between your regular coffee shop, and local pub. During my first visit, I had an Americano, and I loved the coffee. Second visit was during a craft beer tasting night, which was just amazing! The ambience isn't anything extravagant - what makes this place so great are the people, and just how casually you can pull up chairs together and hang around with your friends.   They do have food, not really an extensive menu - I've never eaten here. They are cool with your bringing outside food, so last time we ordered pizza from next door.   Super casual place to hand out with your friends!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once and I know lot of people dig this place, but even though I enjoyed it I wasn't blown away or anything.  The beer menu had some great beers but if you're looking for rare beers there are better places out there.  Had the breakfast there (for lunch) and it was little pricey but good.  I like that when you get a flight of beers you get 5 instead of the typical 4 at most places.  Overall a great place, but feels like the people that work there think this place is god's gift to the city or something even though there are better places.  I'll visit again one day and maybe it'll be a funner visit but for now i'll stick with 3 stars."}
{"text":"My favourite bar in the city.  I used to live about a block away, and now that I don't I miss it terribly. Ridiculously large selection of beers, quaint, awesome back patio, and always a relaxed & friendly crowd.  You'll have a hard time not running in to a friendly face at the Only. Make a point of getting there.  (Oh, and the drinks are quality and CHEAP)  -A"}
{"text":"Walking into this place I thought the only beers they would only have Pabst and Labatt's 50. I was definitely wrong; this place has a very impressive beer selection. In actuality I had heard great things about this place's beer menu and it certainly lived up to the hype.They have quite the selection of taps (around 15) of Canadian craft beers (mostly from Ontario with a few from Quebec), as well as two fridges full of bottles. They had a good mix of funky beers for beer nerds as well as some basic lagers and pilsners for the uninitiated. My friend and I opted to split a pumpkin strong ale which was pretty good. For our second round I opted for the sampler, which was 5 samples for $10 dollars, this consisted of 5 generous samples (a little less than a half pint). This is a great option as you get to try many of their beers; the only dilemma becomes which beers to choose! The bartender suggested I do more than one and try them all, brilliant! Too bad I had driven down on this occasion, but at least I have a plan for next time.    One thing that was really cool was that they had about 5 taps from Niagara College's brewing program. This basically constituted a bunch of 1 offs from students projects at Niagara College (I know! A school with a brewing program! I wish I had known about this when I was graduating high school). I tried 2 samples from Niagara College, one was quite delicious, the other was too sweet for my taste; however it's still awesome that they have stuff from a nearby college.   The ambiance in this place is that of a dive-bar. The space is small but they do have a street and a back patio which are both decent. The two bartenders were really nice and knew their beers quite well. I do believe they have food but this is not really a place I would come to for food. I believe they also let you bring in food as I saw some people bring in a dominos pizza. Overall a great experience in a laid back joint, this place doesn't take its self as seriously as other craft beer places (i.e. volo or beer bistro) which makes it a good place for beer nerds and non-beer nerds alike."}
{"text":"I just live around the corner from The Only and I always hear good things about their brunch. Sometimes, on a warm summer evening, you can hear soft jazz sounds emanating from their double storefront on the Danforth and you are reminded of why you love living in this 'hood.   While this part of the Danforth (you know, the part that is but one subway station East of the \"good\" part of the Danforth, where us average Joes can still afford housing) tries to tidy up a bit by bringing in a French Bakery, a few gift shops and the soon to be speciality burger place in the old Patris Restaurant space, a few things will remain constant: There will apparently always be decrepit, falling down rent-by-the-week apartments at Donlands & Danforth, a 7-11 with tacquitos (3 for $5) calling your name like whispers on the wind and a withdrawal management centre. Thus, there will always be a home for a dive bar or two here and that's a-OK by me.   I also run past The Only a few times a week, early in the morning. It never seems to be closed. What I like most is that they don't try to hide the fact that they're a dive bar, they just dive it up. Crazy tapestry couches that you can literally sink into and lose your ass momentarily, live music, scones and a massive beer selection for such a tiny place.   This place is like the poor man's Peach Pit. It's a hang out for the eccentric Eastenders. It's quiet, the patrons aren't judgemental and should the urge to eat or drink strike you, they can help. Nothing is crazily fancy, but everything is satisfying and inexpensive.   Although the menu is not extensive, it's solid. Lots of fresh offerings, most things come with a little bit of salad, they have a delicious brunch waffle with fresh fruits and whipped cream and lots of coffeehouse style confections.   Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. They have a lot of beers on tap, it's easy to find parking here, and it's a pretty nice to be. I think this is one of my favorite beer bars in Toronto. I asked for the highest IBU beer they had, and the bar tender seemed a little lost. But, he asked the other bartender and they know. I have probably been in the whole cicerone/bjpc scene for so long in California that I am spoiled. I can't fault them too much. I wish this place was bigger, but I didn't realize I could drink in the attatched cafe, so mea culpa.   I would totally go back to this place :)"}
{"text":"Inside, it was rather dim and pub-like - a long bar with plenty of choice of beers of tap, on one side. The wooden counter and tables work well with the wide range of chairs, which all seem to speak the same language of eclecticism. We were impressed with their selection of smoothies and veggies juices. With flue season in its full throttle, we opted in for a 32oz of Immunity from Everything. Just a few bites from our full review.."}
{"text":"***Bazinga***  I scored a Phone Number!  Not from a Girl, but from a Brewery.  That's a whole other level of Magic.  The Only Cafe hosted the Beer Fest - Winter Edition 2013.  From Back Patio Sampling Booths, I've \"sampled\" the Following:  Beaus All Natural Brewing - Burnt Rock(Vanilla Porter) Beaus All Natural Brewing - The Bog.Father(Imperial Gruit) Brewmance(Youtube)        - Rye Pale Ale Lake of Bays                      - Spark House Red Ale Lake of Bays                      - Spring Maple Belgian Blonde Ale St. Ambroise                      - Scotch Ale Sawdust City Brewing        - Ol'Woody AltCask) Sawdust City Brewing        - Whiskey Barrel Aged Long, Dark Voyage to Uranus Wellington Brewery            - County Dark Ale Wellington Brewery            - Smokey the Beer(Smoke Beer)  Fidel Gastro's FoodTruck   - Pulled Pork Chili [$7.00]  Open Back Patio puts the true meaning of WINTER edition. Came to the Party too late, missed Beau's Scarf give-away. Everybody drank the Breweries dry with sudsy conversation.  While inside, The Only was \"Hopping\" to their own Beat. Perfect atmosphere to discover many of the Bottles & Taps. A few groups of Young'uns played their Board Games too.  Plans on a return visit were spoken for some Taste Flights pleasure. Stay Tuned for more event details. Maybe then I'll get a Girl's Number!?"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check this place out forever. I finally got around to going in on a random week night excited to try some interesting beer. There were several people seated at the bar but the place wasn't packed or anything. I stood at the bar for 10 minutes waiting to make a drink order. The bartender was chatting with various people, not pouring drinks, and couldn't be bothered to serve me. Maybe you have to know somebody to get served here? I dunno. I left and went to a bar down the street."}
{"text":"On a recent pub crawl I led, this was our final stop, number 6 of 6.  I say we ended on a high note.  If I had a local, this place would be it even if the Wren and Sauce are more local.  I have been to the Only long before I moved to the Danforth.  It has hosted one of my worst Toronto dates (\"but I got a great story out of it!\").  The beer selection is one of the best on the Danforth.  The back patio is wonderful.  And the crowd is good.  I don't feel like there are many places a mid 20s-mid 40s guy/gal can pick up east of Pape but this one might be one of those places.    I have only ever been here for drinks and only ever for beer.  As mentioned below, it is a bit cramped and dark...it is the kind of place you can get and be drunk in if that makes sense.    Highly recommended--even if you have to cross the Don to get here."}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times and I've always been happy with the service! Employees are friendly and very helpful, if you're looking to try something new, and they have an awesome selection of beers. I'm more of a lager and cider person myself, so I stick to what I know, but if you can think of a random flavour, they probably have it in a beer! Also, if you're coming with a big group, head to the back and there's a huge patio. This is by far, one of my favourite bars on the Danforth."}
{"text":"A true beer fan's delight!  Service (which is bar service only) is a little sketchy at times but once you grab a bartender's attention, you're set for the day/evening.  Food here is not recommended but you can take in your own food from many of the neighbouring joints."}
{"text":"Came here spontaneously tonight, it was pretty crowded but we were able to get a table and hang out comfortably for the evening. They have a really good selection of different types of beers on tap. I am not a big drinker so I ordered a cider, the bartender was able to recommend and give me a sample which was very nice. Overall, the drinks we got were reasonably priced and the service was good. Would come back if I was in the area looking for drinks and a place to hang out."}
{"text":"I have been to many bars in Toronto. I have been to many bars which have an impressive selections of beers in Toronto. Of all of those bars, The Only Cafe takes the cake. They have an impressive 25 beers on tap i believe, and they are always changing with seasons. You are almost always guaranteed to have the opportunity to try beers you have never tried before here. The atmosphere is wonderful. I often come here and sip wonderful Belgian beers while playing a game of chess with a friend. And it is walking distance to my house. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came to the bar-side on this past Saturday night. it was crowded, but we luckily found a table for two quickly! Service was really nice and quick when we asked them to wipe down the table.  There are so many cool things about this place:  Vibe - a varied crowd, everyone is really casual and seemed comfortable talking to each other! They even have some games for patrons on a slow night.  Drinks - somewhat uncommon beers (Unibroue instead of Stella), most for 7$ each Food - they serve some sandwiches, but you are allowed to bring in food from outside. I enjoyed a sandwich and some fries from ASAP City while drinking my beers.   Apparently their patio is nice - I'll have to visit again in summer!"}
{"text":"By far the best bar in the city if you are looking for the largest selection of beer, a mixed and friendly crowd (20-30's anywhere from hippie to professional) and a really groovy atmosphere.    My only complaint is the lack of good English ales recently but I'm not about to knock a star for it.    In the summer there is a big patio open in the back, a small one out front and the cafe side is great for meetings in the afternoon or casual hangouts.  The Americano and lattes are unbelievable and their small but affordable menu has some pretty darn tasty fare on it.    However, if you only go one time, visit on a Friday or Saturday night and go for beer.  See you there!"}
{"text":"This little place won me over. I was a little skeptical walking in here. I didn't know if I would like it at first. It didn't seem like my kind of scene and I was a bit nit-picky, but I ended up really enjoying myself here. My boyfriend and I came to meet a few fellow yelpers for Beer Fest. When we entered a man sitting down gave us tickets to try a cider. So sweet! We then purchased 20 tickets and  began sampling beers. Everyone was so friendly and nice and talkative. The chairs at the bar were comfy (I was pleasantly surprised) and I really liked the live band there. Oh, I also really loved the beer and would 100% go to this again. After Beer Fest ended at 9:30, the place cleared out a bit and we were able to get a table to sit down and talk. We had so much beer it was hard to finish it! My only complaint was that it was a bit cold. I dressed warm but I was freezing on the one side (because the door was open and the beers were out back) and I couldn't warm up after that. I just kept my jacket on. This was a charming little spot and I would definitely visit again!"}
{"text":"with this much selection the best tip is to don't be shy and just ask the bartender for his opnion. I just went for a dark brown lager.... very good stop to charge my phone n chill out."}
{"text":"This bar has the most extensive selection of beers I've seen at any bar in Toronto. There are beers from several different countries, as well as some local brews. You can see from behind the counter what bottles of beer they have, and you can also see the brews on tap. It might be a good idea to ask for the menus, as they list the full selections.  I was surprised at how crowded the place was for a bar in the east, but it's a nice place to go. The decor is kind of rustic and eclectic, and the place feels welcoming.  Maybe it looked really crowded because the place is tiny and the layout is kind of weird, but there were several people standing up, when all the tables were full.  The bar is connected to another room, where they serve coffee drinks. When there were no places to sit in the room with the bar, my companion asked if we could sit in the other room, which was ok with them. I like the other room better, as it feels much more intimate and it's nowhere near as noisy (the bar gets really loud, it might be difficult to hear your friends talking)!  Plus, the other room has some comfortable looking couches. It's a place I could spend a few hours at comfortably."}
{"text":"Love to hang out here. So cozy. Yes its small but it feels like home. A very large selection of beers from around the world. Better in the summer when you can sit on the patio out back. I love that we can bring in our own food. Like the pizza place next door. The guy there was so nice he made it fresh for us and brought it over. Always great."}
{"text":"The Only Cafe is a pretty weird, unique place, but in a good way!  When you first enter the bar, it looks like your regular, run-of-the-mill pub. Kind of cramped, but in a charming, kitschy way. However, what is hidden is an awesome patio at the back! It's super spacious and beautifully lit for the night time in the summer. I saw more than a couple of (obvious) first dates taking place, and I'd agree that it's a pretty good place to grab a drink with that potential catfish.  The Only Cafe is another one of those places where you can bring in whichever outside food you desire, so keep that in mind if you're the snacking type. The beer selection is excellent, so you won't be left wanting in that department. If you're looking for a casual place to grab a drink with the friends, I'd wholeheartedly recommend The Only Cafe!"}
{"text":"Super laid back, great vibe, awesome neighbourhood watering hole!  Have been here for late night drinks a bunch of times. I also drive by quite often, and it seems to be the most popular watering hole in the area!  Looks like a dump but ISN'T! Strange decor but it all works - I think because THE ONLY isn't trying to be something it's not... it just IS.  Staff and fellow patrons are friendly and seem genuinely happy to be there. Love that!  Great selection of beer and yummy yummy cocktails! Perfect place to become a regular!"}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE beer selection, and great patio out back. Friendly staff and cozy interior. Will definitely be going back to sample more brews."}
{"text":"jeez. im stumbling on all the good stuff where no one has written anything yet. The Only Cafe (here to for referred to as \"the only\" but without quotes) is all about the feel good atmosphere.  and its beer.  FEEL GOOD ATMOSPHERE:  sit down and gab with the bartender, you are sure to have a good conversation.  take one of their boardgames and play with yourself (no one will judge) or a friend.  stare for countless hours at the walls which are plastered with posters of musical and movie icons and lord knows what else.  wonder how long that candle which has spilled wax over the bar, on the floor, up your shoe and onto your leg has been burning.  smile and listen to the music.  OR  just get tanked and do all of the above at once.    enter AND ITS BEER: so i wont list them; i wont be that tedious, but if you are a beer lover, connoisseur,  or cultured drunk i guess, youll love the choices they have from all the best beer making countries on earth (or maybe thats just europe and canada).  ask the bartenders, they know.  or just do as the romans do and follow the advice of the graphic designer that created the label good enough to dupe you into trying his beer.  both methods work just as well.  for a hoot, try their brunches on the weekends and lunches during the week.  ive only tried the brunch and it was quite tasty: say the queens breakfast or for the sweet tooth, the belgian waffles. and bands play on sundays i think. check the website.  ps theres a pinball machine."}
{"text":"This place is small and fills up quickly on a Friday night. There's a weird mix of patrons. The Only Cafe (around the corner from the Donlands subway station) seems to be the last decent place to get a beer before the Danforth turns sketchy. So you seem to get the night life crowd from Pape/Greektown and bar flies from east of the Donlands.   Yelp's lovely August L. asked a nearby patron (an older gentleman that didn't seem to want to take off his winter coat) if he could take a group shot (the Mad About Plaid yelp contingent) and he quickly suggested the women in our rather conservatively dressed group hike up their tops to reveal their chests. Hmmm. (Not that I'm one who should be getting up on his moral high horse... but I got dibs on those all those boobs, buddy.)  That all aside, what's really awesome about this place is the 30 or so imported beers they have in the fridge. They run about $7.25 but it's awesome to drink a Russian beer followed by a Chinese beer followed by an Italian beer.  All 'n' all, if I had friends that lived out this way, The Only Cafe would be a great place to huddle, slowly work our way through beers of the world as we slowly age, and chat about retirement planning."}
{"text":"laid back, great back patio, obviously lots of regulars who know eachother.  No bar service on the patio, but whatever! no big deal.  limited food also, but went next door and picked up a pizza and brought it over.  If you're looking for a laid back place to grab a beer on a great patio...with no pretension at all, then this is your place!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  It's as much an institution as a bar, but it's also my go-to local.  It's worn at the edges for sure, but that's part of the charm.  Friendly staff, great beer, a fun clientele and a true bohemian , local, independent vibe.  Oh and the patio is a summertime institution."}
{"text":"So cool is this place, it has been mentioned in a Lowest of the Low song.  So cool as well is the fact that the name is a lie.  The Only is not the only Only.  There's also one in Peterborough, each one modelled after the other.  As soon as you step in, you are affronted with a very bohemian, avant-garde bar area with collections of art work and sculpture scattered throughout.  An old wooden bar lines the side wall to the rear of the restaurant which is dark and candle-lit, making this a place you'd wish to hear poetry read...or ghost stories, take your pick.  The collection of beers and liquors is equally as eclectic as the décor.  Presenting beers from across Ontario, Canada, and the world, the drink menu is wide of range and not overpriced in the least, a testament to the starving artist community that imbibes there.  The food focuses on brunch and lunch only, but a snack menu is available featuring tasty dips and other snackables at most times throughout the evening.  If you catch them at a late point in the evening where the kitchen is closed, they have no trouble with you going across the street to the 7-Eleven (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/7-eleven-food-stores-toronto-2) to grab some chips or beef jerky to bring back.  I'd go way more often if I had an excuse to get to the neighbourhood more."}
{"text":"A dive bar with awesome beers!  The Only Cafe doesn't look like much from the outside...or the inside for that matter, but that's OK, they have a great selection of Ontario (and sometimes other Canadian) craft beers, both on tap and in the bottle.  Prices are as reasonable as one will find for craft beers in Ontario.  This place gets fairly crowded and fairly loud, so come early to get a table and to converse without shouting.  One plus, is that they do a very reasonably priced sampler.   It's 5, 5-ounce pours of anything on tap for $10.  Given that some of the high-alcohol beers are $8 for less than a pint, this is a pretty good bargain.  It's also a great way to get to try a big range of beers.  The danger, though, is that if you're adventurous you might leave one unconsumed, as was the case with a smoked-malt beer.  It felt like I was drinking liquid smoke and was one of the few craft beers, I just utterly gave up on.  I think they have food options, but I didn't see anyone eating, nor were they really advertised.  Of course, I'm here for the beer, and I enjoyed the casual vibe."}
{"text":"Casual vibe. They are serious about the beer and have a great selection. They a few tasty stout options, which I love. Bartenders care about this and will give you all the details you could ever want.  Patrons vary widely in age and type. A female friend was waiting alone for a few minutes, and she mentioned that she was accosted by 3 different men crudely attempting to initiate conversation. It was probably just her being hot and wrong place, wrong time.  Good patio vibes. It gets a bit shady at night. One time there was a racoon that did not care about being surrounded by humans. It proceeded to rifle through the garbage can that was outside and then saunter off past our table with some scraps of food.  Conclusion: Excellent casual option for quality beers"}
{"text":"Some of the most amazing lattes on the Danforth. Great cookies too. Definitely a go to place in the morning.   Have a lot of fun beers on tap with a wide variety of tastes and types. Pretty good patio on the back. Pretty sure you can order food from other places and bring it in with you which is nice (Danforth Pizza House is right near by). My only gripe is that if you're sitting at a table at the front and the windows are open, I hope you like smoking because you'll be inhaling second hand smoke the entire time."}
{"text":"the only is a one-stop-shop.  best beer selection in the city (save maybe bar volo and barhop), good coffee, good juice bar, wifi, sandwiches... and if you wind up too drunk after it all you can stay in their hostel above for the night. plus $5 pints on sundays."}
{"text":"I randomly happened upon this place after having given up on drinking anywhere other than an Ethiopian night club (I was coming from the easterly direction). It was a pleasant surprise. Good selection of bottled beers as other reviewers have said and one or two interesting draft options. This definitely feels like a locals type of place and has a nice vibe. You would be hard pressed to find a chunk of bear wall anywhere in the joint. paraphernalia is everywhere. some kitschy, some just plain random.  I would probably go back if i found myself in the neighbourhood..particularly if i have a craving for some Ethiopian food beforehand :)  Update: I went back here recently. Somehow I missed the belgian beer fridge in the front the first time. I'm upping my review to 4 stars because they have the cheapest belgian bottled beer in town! and they have nearly the selection of volo at 3/4 the price. westmalle tripel for $7.25! sweet! mort subite for $8. sweet!"}
{"text":"Ce bar est génial ! On s'y sent comme chez soi, vraiment. Un peu excentré du centre-ville, donc peut-être qu'il y a pareil ailleurs et qu'il ne vaut pas un grand détour mais j'étais logée à 5 minutes donc j'y suis souvent allée.  Il y a deux salles, un avec le bar et l'autre plus cozy qui fait office de café le matin, ainsi qu'une terrasse de l'autre côté (qui ne donne pas sur le trottoir donc). La déco est super top, avec les bougies dégoulinantes de cire, les petits fauteuils, les mugs qui font penser à la maison dans lesquels on vous sert le café le matin, les tabourets décorés du sigle coloré \"Only Cafe\", une carte du monde bien rigolote sur une table. Bref des petits détails top !  On y trouve un tas de bières, dont le barman se fera un plaisir d'expliquer les goûts, et vous pourrez même y goûter si vous n'arrivez pas à vous décider. Elles sont vraiment bonnes !  De jour comme de nuit, je recommande complètement."}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots in the whole Toronto area. You know, when you find spot that is very characteristic of the city-- that is The Only. Friendly vibe, many regulars (from hostel above),  only great (!) music playing  (you'll hear everything from Gorillaz/Pixies to Oldies to Electro versions of classical music).  Several times I stumbled on live bands playing in the cafe, mostly indie/ rock genres.   Great for: bringing open minded first dates; mingling alone with yourself, working passionately on computer, having relaxing coffee/beer late at night with friend.   My so far favourite drink in cafe is Matcha Latte, green tea with whipped cream, so thick you can eat it with spoon, bittersweet taste with hint of milk chocolate (well, that's what I smell there, but it is not included actually).  The bar is amazing, too: great collection of craft beer, and whenever I come there to try something new, the bartender kindly offers me to try first any of those before buying. Love it.  On Wednesdays (correct me if I'm wrong) they usually have dj coming with his vinyl records collection and he just plays them, rare and interesting tracks.  In summer don't forget to mingle in the back patio, only once we were chased off it by angry and annoying herd of bees, otherwise it is very pleasant and quiet place.   Oh, and did I forget: boardgames and pinball machine...?"}
{"text":"My favourite East end bar.   An incredible beer selection for all those aficionados (try the Schlenkerla Rauchbier), nice staff, a frustrating but addictive pinball machine and an excellent 2 storey patio out back.  What more could you want?    The coffee bar, couches, laid back atmosphere, trivial pursuit and other games are also good additions.  With Opera Bob's in the West, Smokeless Joe's in the South and The Only in the East,  what could the North have in store...?"}
{"text":"Great (and reasonably priced) beer list, BYOFood, sweet back patio where you can hang with the friendly neighbourhood raccoons. What's not to love?   I always walk out of The Only thinking they've undercharged me or missed some beers because my bill is always cheaper than I think it is. Every single time. But nope, just good beer at good prices."}
{"text":"A Danforth favourite, that's for sure.   VIBE  It's dark, it's cluttered and crowded, the staff won't come to you and it's hipster aka not Ronnie's Local 69. Welcome to the Only. Back patio is great. Not sure if they're still here but the old ladies that serve brunch on the weekend are the best. Good fun and great crowd. There's a pin ball machine in the back and board games too. Just watch your elbows though --you may knock someone over!  I DRANK Lots of lovely craft beers here. If I'm in the mood, I'll get a Fruli.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  It is the \"only\" one with seeping character on the Danny."}
{"text":"I have never eaten food here.  Moxie tells me there is no food served in the evening, just drinking, but that you're welcome to bring food from somewhere else to go with your beers.  The good: - Good selection of draught beers and very good selection of bottled beers - Coopers and the special edition Innis & Gunn - Cheap.  We had 4 or 5 Coopers and it was like 24$ - Great staff - very cool people, very cool recommendations, great time all around - Great crowd - it was a bit older, people who live in the area, everyone was happy and there for a good time, no one was out to cause problems  The bad: - it's hard to get to from my house.  Seriously, I can either take a trolley and a bus or a trolley and the subway.  I want to only take a trolley. - I wish they had SOME food  Would I visit here again? Yes.  Yes, yes, yes.  Absolutely.  If it was easier to get to it would bump Prohibition for my local."}
{"text":"As far as dive bars go, this is a pretty good one. It's got everything that a little \"indie treasure\" like this should have: pretty good beer selection (including a fridge full of one-off craft beers), excellent music, and creepy washrooms. Wouldn't say the drinks were cheap though.  It's a bit dark, and there really isn't any decent seating to be had in the winter. It's got the usual blend of hipsters, and sad old drunks, but that's okay. I sort of like drinking alongside ironic, and unironic beards."}
{"text":"The Only Cafe led to my discovery of the Indie Coffee Passport because it was apart of it last year, which I was glad to stumble upon.  I got to speak with Kat, the barista, about the history of the cafe and how it differs from other Toronto cafes. The Only Cafe has been opened for about 3 years now, as an extension to The One in the Only bar, which was established 30 years ago. The owner. James, is a traveller and wanted to be able to welcome travellers all over the world to Toronto. So this past July, he opened a hostel above the cafe! In order to get a room, you must live outside of the GTA and sign up online through their website. It's $28 per night and you will receive a free waffle breakfast with unlimited amount of coffee and tea. Since it first opened, it became #4 hostel in Canada! Instead of just being local, The Only Cafe aims for an international feel with its customers.  The owner likes to support local businesses. The food ingredients are from Masellis Supermarket and the cafe sells coffee beans from i deal coffee. In helping the community, The Only Cafe would donate coffee to community events, particularly ones that are hosted in The Pocket, in order to give back to Toronto.  The food and drinks served are vegan and vegetarian oriented. James didn't want a cafe that overcharges for coffee, so the prices on the menu are aimed to be low. For a latte, you will get a pint for only $4 and adding syrups does not cost extra! And for customer convenience, all the prices are rounded after taxes.  I decided to get the large iced frappe and let me warn you, do not try to sweeten it yourself. It is not a sweet drink, though I am unsure if it could be sweetened as per request. But if you attempt to dump in sugar and honey like I did, it would be a mess. Since it is a cold drink, the sugar and honey would harden and drinking it would NOT work out. I managed to finish it but if I didn't attempt to make it sweeter, it would have been perfectly fine to drink.  What's my personal take on the cafe? It's a very artsy community and I studied here a few times in the past. However, I realized this time when I was studying, once night falls it gets really loud and becomes integrated into the bar scene. So if you do come here to get work done, I suggest early in the afternoon. But if you want to grab your friends together for drinks/coffee, then it is definitely a good place to hang out."}
{"text":"Welcoming and affordable spot for casual drinks with a few friends. Came by on a weekend lunch and easily found a spot. It seemed like a neighbourhood dive bar with regular customers of all ages hanging out. It was a long narrow space but we got a lovely spot by the front window. The decor was vintage and eclectic - without any irony because it was actually added to the space over the years.   There was a good selection of local beers and ciders on tap - hooray for Pommies ($4.50), which tasted way better than the bottled version. I also had the Sophia Lauren sandwich ($8), with tomato, basil leaves, bocconcini and a pesto spread. It was better than expected and pretty big for the price. The staff were friendly, nice and fast. Overall a neat bar without the hipsters or their prices!"}
{"text":"This was definitely an interesting place.  When I first walked in I walked in on the bar side (entrance) but the coffee portion had its own entrance or you can walk through the back.    It reminded me of an old school English bar that was repurposed with a lot more small tables and surprisingly loud given that there was me a lot of talk.    It was very casual, latte was decent.  Everyone has their jackets on inside sitting and working or reading--a bit chilly but otherwise a great place to work on something."}
{"text":"So this is where my mom threw away all my shit from my childhood! I thought this place was adorable. I was wandering the Danforth and wanted to grab a coffee somewhere.   I ordered a large latte and it was LARGE (the barista handed us our lattes in a Mill Street pint glass!) It was ok... I guess. I get the feeling that even though the word caffe appears in its name, this place shines best as a bar. To best honest I don't think I would eat here... in fact I didn't even know they had food until I read the other reviews for this place. No one brought us a menu.  In any case I sat down in some comfy chairs and took advantage of the numerous boardgames in the back. I will definitely need to try this place out during the night one time."}
{"text":"Part One - Warming up for the Winter Beer Fest at The Only Cafe  Love the beer selections here both on Tap and in Bottles. I like how they have a little booklet that has the profile of what they have on tap with characteristic, tasting notes and pricing. I ended up ordering:  Aporkalypse Now Oatmeal Bacon Stout ($4.50) - more smokey than meaty, but really easy to drink and I can tell myself I am having some healthy grains.  I need to come back for some of their bottles. I wish my fridge is loaded with all these beers too..  Part Two - Sampling Beer in the Back Patio for Winter Beer Fest at The Only Cafe  Beer Fest Winter 2013   Armed with 20 $1 sampling tickets I was able to tried quite a few of the offerings, OK almost all they have (thanks for Untapped App so I kind of remember)  Great Lakes Brewery - Lube Job Baltic Porter Great Lakes Brewery - Belgian Quad Great Lakes Brewery - Harry Porter and The Bourbon Soaked Vanilla Beans Porter Great Lakes Brewery - 25th Anniversary Bourbon Barrel-Aged Russian Imperial Stout Flying Monkeys - Balls To the Wall Russian Imperial Stout Flying Monkeys - The Matador Imperial IPA Aged on Spanish Cedar Nickel Brook - Maple Porter Nickel Brook - Old Kentucky Bastard Imperial Stout Grand River - Jubilation Winter Warmer Hogtown - Hog Wild IPA Mill Street - ESB Extra Special Bitter Cameron's - Rye Pale Ale (RPA) Black Oak - Double Chocolate Cherry Stout Steam Whistle - Pilsner Unfiltered Plus King Brewery - Dark Unfiltered Kensington Brewing - Baldwin FishEye IPA  I never thought I would be drinking beers for 2 hours outdoor in below freezing temperature. But this is one of the best beer fest I ever been to. People are nice, Beer kept flowing and those high ABV % Stout kept me warm and toasty.  I will definitely be coming back to The Only Cafe for more beers.... LOVE"}
{"text":"I love this place. I found my favourite beer here, and it's the bar that I compare all other bars to. Nobody can beat their impressive and always changing list of beers on tap. Go to their website and check it out. The patio is also great, and much needed as the space is small and can get really full on a friday or saturday night. And don't miss their beerfests and events! Plus the crowd here is an interesting mix of old-guys, hipsters, dates, girls/guys nights out, and basically if you can think of it, you'll see it here.  Have I mentioned that I seriously, really love the only?   Years ago I went to school across the street, so I'd get my coffee fix from the one, and it was *my* cafe. It felt like home, with it's mismatched chairs and mugs, and dark, cozy atmosphere. Pinball? Boardgames? heck yeah. Then I grew up and fell in love with beer, and yet again the only has become mine. Sundays are especially awesome since a pint is $5, over the normal $7 (which is still a great deal).   Downsides: Small space, so you dont always get a seat, and it's also bad for large groups if you show up in the middle of a busy night, the music and staff can be hit and miss, but who cares? If you love beer, you'll love this place.  Also, squareboys is across the street."}
{"text":"A rainy Saturday late in April, around noon, when we walked in to The Only Café and ordered Americanos with some pasteries. Perfect coffee, delicious pastry in a very Bohemian cool café. This place plays a key part in Linden MacIntyre's novel \"The Only Café\" a complex and very good story, but never mind! ... then in walk a group of people who ask the barista, Cody to read a poem! About the café and him. They are part of \"The Neighbourhood Poetry Project\" at Pape branch of the Toronto Public Library on a tour of the hood after their workshop. This is what a local café is all about; friendly, relaxed with good coffee and vibes."}
{"text":"This place is pretty legit. I am in Toronto for a family reunion and while in town we have been going out trying to find a place that has good craft beers that one can find outside of Canada which we hadnt really been able to do prior.   The ambiance was cool. We ended up going with a group of 5 and got the area up  front that had a table and a sofa for us to sit on. The lighting was intimate and the music was the right volume as to where we could enjoy the tunes without having to yell over each other.  As for the beers, they were good and the selection was great with craft beers from the states that we were endulged in. The prices were about average. They werent cheap but werent expensive they were average.  I would recommend this place and will probably end up going back before our trip ends :)"}
{"text":"OK, so now that I know better than to ever order the food here, I'd recommend it for all beer lovers. On the first Sunday of every month they host a Beer 101 course next door at The One In The Only. Come for a drink on the bar side and you just might get some free runoff...  Huge beer selection (like, three fridges' worth), the staff is cool and knowledgeable, and there is a sweet back patio that I'll bet you didn't even know about. Iced tea (Nestea) and pop are both humanely priced at $1, which is much appreciated when you're having a non-alcoholic night and don't want to be gouged for being a teetotaller.   I say no to \"good for groups\" because this place is narrower than a matchstick and unwieldy when at capacity. The bathrooms, as expected, are terrifying.  The decor is kinda dumpy but you'll surely find something to fall in love with: Smurf figurines on the countertop, mismatched portraits of high school crushes like Ruhollah Khomeini and Yoko Ono, or perhaps the macrame barn owl that I secretly want to steal for my bathroom wall??"}
{"text":"Nice enjoyable place for drinks and food. Free wifi, serves alcohol, sit as long as you want. It got a little bit louder nearing evening time so it's not a place to study or work but great for socializing."}
{"text":"A great place for a first date. They have a wide selection of beers (and stout) and if your night there goes well, they make an awesome brunch and have good coffee. Diverse music is played but not too loudly. Also, they have a limited dinner menu but are ok with you bringing in food from elsewhere. As for this being called a hipster bar, it's been here for over 25 years that I know of. Crowds shift, fresh faces are almost always good."}
