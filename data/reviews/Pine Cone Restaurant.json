{"text":"This place doesn't look like much, but the food is solid home cookin' and the service is super friendly. The baked goods are very good - and you can buy extra to take with you!"}
{"text":"Continuing on my Saturday morning hangover theme: there's just something about a plateful of greasy food when you're slightly hung over that makes it all better. The Pine Cone has down-home, rib-sticking, greasy food in spades.  The SO and I split the chicken fried steak, which comes with plenty of toast, hashbrowns, and two eggs.  I could'nt finish mine!  The gravy must be the same that they use for biscuits and gravy, because it tasted sausage-y, and as my plate sat there I could see the grease rising to the top.  BUT--I didn't come here in search of health food, and it was just what the doctor ordered. I'll work out later."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Madison MINUS the coffee!  I have tried the coffee on multiple occasions to give them the benefit of the doubt, but could barely stomach it every time.  By all means, go and eat breakfast, but take your own coffee!  I've never eaten lunch or dinner there."}
{"text":"I went for the fish fry and that's why I gave it two stars (I'd like to try breakfast.).  The place looked promising for their wasn't a seat in the house.  However, the fish fry was very disappointing but at least the price was right.  You get the typical choices of fish and the way you want them prepared.  The menu says your choice of potato but I don't think the waitress said \"baked potato\".  I ordered potato pancakes and it was served with butter on top.  I never heard of that.  The other sides were mediocre and the store-bought bun was huge.  Nothing I would go back for."}
{"text":"A delicious breakfast.  Amazing fresh bakery and pastry items.  HOWEVER, the parkinglot/gas station area is filthy.  Strewn with debris, dead cars, broken glass.  If you judge a book by this cover you would NEVER venture inside.  I hope the Mgr.  sees this and cleans up."}
{"text":"This is definitely not your usual truck stop. Pastries look delicious. Dinner rolls are large enough for a meal themselves and good!  We had a young waitress who I think was new. We found her to be sweet, polite and trying very hard. The lady managing the restaurant was really rude to her. We could all hear it."}
{"text":"Enjoyable experience for the whole family. The wait staff was courteous and friendly; the food was reasonably priced and a good value. A word of advice--LEAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT! the deserters are great but huge! Plan to bring some home"}
{"text":"The banana bread French toast was out of this world! I would drive 2 hrs on occasions to eat here"}
{"text":"A great place to eat. Friendly service with a smile. A1 food and bakery with a fair price"}
{"text":"I frequented this place daily for hours on end. Yeah the Food is Great. But I feel really bad for the staff working there. It's a constant revolving door for employees. I had a redheaded beautiful sweet gal wait on me 5 days in a row. Last summer the owner had some remodeling being done to expand the bakery. As a result the air conditioner kept running non stop, and it was down right cold. All of her customers except me sat in her station then quickly moved to sit in back area where it was warmer. She asked if she too could move or pick up tables that moved. She was told No. She asked to wear her coat the remainder of her shift. She was told yes, then no and maybe all at once. Because the fill in manager at the time on duty couldn't make a decision and stick to it for fear she would be fired. So being true to herself she put on her coat and then caught hell all night by her coworkers. So she asked permission to buy long sleeve uniform or to speak w owner to wear her coat. No and No were her answers. She came in next day w long sleeve shirt under her polo. She asked for permission first it was yes then later she was told to take it off bc it wasn't part of her uniform or to go home. She went home until she could get long sleeved uniform and talk to owner. So she comes in next morning to talk to owner. John tells her she doesnt work there anymore and she's fired.  A week goes by I'm having coffee this gal comes in for her check and asks John to sign paperwork for unemployment and food stamps. He refused and added if she came back he would call the police. She begged him so she could fend for herself and her kids until she found something else, but he said she was harassing him and she was now trespassing. I sit there day and night watching how these people treat their employees and  its beyond belief. They must not have a heart or soul to be that vicious to others. The 2nd shift manager is just very ugly to people always trying to be funny but instead becomes obnoxious, sarcastic and often her belligerence spills out like puke from her mouth. I personally have heard her tell several customers including myself and other employees she was gonna punch them in the face. Truck stop or not I didn't appreciate it. I kept my mouth shut up until now but after that threat from the manager I figure everyone should Know. It takes more than good food to make a great place. Don't bring your kids folks, b/c it's hard telling what the owner and manager might say. And for the young lady who was harassed by them and fired for being true to herself, I hope you're doing well and wanted you to know someone saw that treatment you endured and is now voicing it. I won't be back I'll be spending my time and money elsewhere,"}
{"text":"All around good.  Huge portions and Massive baked goods. Not much for the health minded diner, but if you want truck stop chow, this is the place on the north east side. Wait staff is typically good and don't care if you sit and talk for a while after you eat.

The Eclairs are pretty legendary and cinnamon roll that will feed 2 or 3 for a few bucks. Been going for years and won't be long before I go back!"}
{"text":"hands down one of the best breakfasts my wife and i have had. stopped in here based on the positive reviews from fellow yelpers and was sure glad i did. 

this is a good sized diner at a truck stop. the first thing that caught our eye was the pastries - they were all huge and all looked great. tip - be sure to save space for at least one. 

i went with the cinnamon roll french toast and was very pleased. very large portion and great taste - go witht the sausage patty over the links. people behind us had links on their plate and they didnt look too appetzing. the patty was good. 

wife went with a chicken friend steak, eggs, and hashbrowns. hashbrowns left a bit to desire but they get bonus points for being real potatoes and fresh. 

overall, great experience and we were in and out in 35 mins so we could continue out journey. looking forward to stopping here again sometime soon."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled because it's in a truck stop, truckers know where there are good places to eat. Stop here just for the desserts, I bought an eclair that must have weighed a pound, delicious, like they are supposed to be made. Cream Puffs look like they wouldn't fit in a one pound coffee can... grin. Don't miss this place..."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband and kids.The seating part was confusing. We were told that they were going to put tables together and to wait. Then We were told to find any spot and have a seat. Once we did that, I felt that we weren't supposed to do that because the waitress seemed upset with us. She wasn't the friendliest waitress. Anyway, we ordered our drinks and coffee and the waitress gave me a cup of coffee then set the pot down and walked away. Okay.. so I searched for creamers and sugar and did my own thing. We then ordered our food and one of our kids had her head down because she was tired and moody. The waitress then came with our food and set a plate down under our tired girl and her hair ended up touching the food. Out of all of those spots to chose, she set the plate down under our moody girls hair. We were sharing pancakes and ordered their 3 of their 3 pancake meals and added some extra sides and we just asked for empty plates. The waitress came back once to check on us. As I sat and watched her friendly demeanor with the other customers and refilling their waters and coffee, I couldn't help but to wonder what we were doing to deserve the cold shoulder? Our kids were quiet, we had one moody girl that was not being rude, and we were just there to eat breakfast. My food was okay. It was breakfast. Nothing fancy. Anyway, I filled my own coffee, shared water with my kids, and just couldn't wait to get out of there! The place itself was not impressive. It's a lot older and seems a bit dated. Some of our cups were still dirty but we were not complaining because we wanted to be respectful. We just didn't drink out of the dirty ones and drank out of the cleaner cups while we waited for refills that never came. Anyway, we probably won't come here again for food. We'll stick to the Norski Nook and Gus's diner."}
{"text":"We are from Illinois and vacation often in Rhinelander.  Every time we head up north we make it a point to stop at Pine Cone!  Their baked goods are AMAZING!!!  Cinnamon rolls drenched in cream cheese frosting!  Peanut butter cookies that are so rich!  Elephant ears, bear claws, eclairs!  You name it, they've got it and EVERYTHING from the bakery is delish!  We have had breakfast here as well and their breakfast does NOT disappoint!  I personally like the thick and fluffy french toast while my husband is a bacon and eggs kind of guy.  Don't miss this one!  It is WELL worth it!"}
{"text":"This is a breakfast review. I ordered the 5oz. Country Fried Steak (CFS) and was supremely disappointed. I understand that with a dish such this you want to put a twist on it. Now, I can't say that what I will describe is accurate as far as technique is concerned but I'll paint a clear picture. 

First, the hash brown were ok. They are definitely made from fresh, not frozen potatoes. The eggs were done perfectly- I order soft scrambled. The toast was almost dry, which is not bad if you like it that way, but I don't, and my server never came back to ask if I needed anything such as butter. 

The CFS arrived extremely dark fried as if it had been double fried- once to cook it, and a second time much later to make it warm for me. The crust was brown and maybe black and tasted of burned fried food. The steak was not tender, had not been pounded, and was very dry, and cooked beyond well done. The battered steak tasted of old oil and left an aftertaste that I washed down with powered iced tea- another WTF. Really? Powdered iced tea?

Recommendation: don't order the CFS. Everything they cook here is a little different from what the norm is. So, expect something- whatever that is. 

PLUS SIDE: The Pine Cone has a small pie and pastry case with delicious goodies. I bought the pecan roll. great!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best breakfasts I have had! Is the decor dated? Absolutely but it just adds to the nostalgic charm! The place just reeks of beef cooking... Ahhh delicious! Check out the pastry cases!!!! OMG, is all I have to say!"}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast. Omelette was ok. Hash browns were greasy. Nothing special. Bathrooms definitely needed attention."}
{"text":"Only went here once about a year and a half ago, but they had great pancakes! My only problem with it at the time was that they allowed smoking, so I left smelling like a cigarette. With the change in law, I'm sure the atmosphere has improved!"}
{"text":"The breakfast is absolutely fantastic and quick. I always stop when traveling through!  It is a classic"}
{"text":"We had no intentions of stoping here   Pulled in for gas stayed for the food. Great service and great food. Treat selection was I wanted it all!! Huge variety and right on the amount moistness"}
{"text":"This place was very highly recommended by many friends who travel through WI.  The staff is friendly and very attentive.  The food however is extremely bland.  Beef was dry and had no taste.  Potatoes taste watery.  The Dumpling Soup was bland as well.  I am giving 3 stars for phenomenal service.  Very reasonably priced as well.  Try for yourself though as my friends all love it."}
{"text":"This place is actually a pretty good diner, which is surprising considering its a truck stop.

I'd say that even though it's pretty similar, this Pine Cone is actually a smidge better than the one out in Johnson Creek. It's still a truck stop, mind you--the food is still greasy and hearty, but this location always seems a little bit cleaner and the servers a bit more on-the-ball. I've had messed up orders at the one in Johnson Creek, but never here.

The bakery of course, is the main draw. They have a huge variety of sweets and  they're always very delicious. I'd say for the baked goods alone they're worth checking out if you haven't been--in that respect they could easily compete with standalone bakeries.

The prices are extremely low compared to a lot of places around Madison, as well."}
{"text":"With a recent addition of a truck driver for a BF I have found myself frequenting truck stops to dine. This little place is quite a pleasant surprise. Basically it is just great home cooking. Everything is homemade and quite good. The baked goods in the front counter were amazing. The size of the cinnamon rolls was insane. And of course I couldn't leave without a piece of pie."}
{"text":"Good filling food. Nice waitresses. Great flavor, dinner rolls of fluffy goodness.

Wouldn't bring my date, got some serious stares from the clearly more common patrons. Next time I'll wear my trucker hat.

I'd definitely recommend the place."}
{"text":"As pinball wizard blasts loudly on the overhead speakers, and the lack of WiFi I thought for a moment I was caught in a time warp back to 1969, but then upon further examination I realized it was some sort of a trap! I too may of been in snared in  this gruesome hell, with withered old gray haired men, doomed to haunt this place for all of eternity. Ever so slowly growing older as we all sit in silent torment. The décor has shown the wear of an eternity of tormented souls in its mits. I feel the worst for my server, a kind and friendly 20 something who manages to keep high spirits while slaving to serve the withered souls who are forever doomed to haunt this aged relic of a far gone era. The one glimmer of light other then my server who made my internment here better was the fair quality of the food. It is by far higher quality then a Denny's, or Perkins. If I can find a way to escape this surreal environment I cannot say I will be back, but not because of the food or service, but because I'm only 40 and by far too young for this place."}
{"text":"I eat here often.  I always say I'm going to get something different but I never do.  The biscuits and gravy are so good they will call to you in the middle of the night and keep you awake.  That's not a problem, they are open 24/7."}
{"text":"I may not be a truck driver, but I do appreciate the portion sizes.  If you are looking for big cookies and other bakery items, be sure to stop here!

I love their chicken and dumpling soup.  It's always warm, and hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Love love this place... My husband is a truck driver and we get stuck with the same old truck stop food.... But here is good home cooking and prices are great compared to the size of everything... And If you have a sweet tooth then this is your stop... Great food and great people...."}
{"text":"Pretty good dinner with a nice selection of food. Open 24 hours and provide nice service. I usually go here after a night of partying. My favorite dish is the Fried Chicken Eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner with my family. Ordered some soup. When it was brought out, it was sour. Like it had sat out for a week before being warmed and served. When it brought to our waitresses attention she attempted to fix the problem when I heard another waitress make a comment that we are just looking for free food. This waitress was walking around the restaurant in flip flops talking about her serve safe.... I found that laughable. Clearly not a food trained professional. This establishment used to be great, known for their astonishing portions and desserts. Now it's just a sad dump on the side of the road that smells of filth, chemicals and rotting food."}
{"text":"It's nothing special. I'm new to the Madison area, and my local friends talked this place up and down. I went into the experience with a ho-hum attitude, which may be affective of my ho-hum review, but it's really nothing more than a truck stop, cheap food joint.

We went later at night (there from about 10PM-midnight), which was probably the best part about the experience - that its open forever. It feels like a gas station, as it should, because that's where it's at. Our waitress definitely reflected that she was 3rd-shifting it, because she was basically a 65-year-old zombie. Okay, part of the experience, I suppose.

The baked goods looked DELICIOUS. I was starving at this point, and them being the first thing you see when you walk in was probably what influenced me to get the cinnamon roll french toast. Also, though, I consider myself somewhat of a french toast aficionado. (Whatever that means.) Let me just say: this is NOT for the weak of heart - literally. Pretty sure I locked myself in to a diagnosis of diabetes within the next 6 months. There were three of their housemade cinnamon rolls - a perfect amount, you think, as you dive in with your fork. You immediately realize that you'll need a knife for these bad boys, though, as the sugary everythingness of it is essentially encased in a caramelized shell of even more sugar. I LOVE that there is icing inside - not many cinnamon-roll-french-toast-serving establishments can claim this about the dish. However, after two-thirds of the dish, I was ready to throw up, and had to force the rest down my throat (not because I payed a lot for it, just because I wanted to tell Yelp that I almost threw up eating these). It's just SO much sugar.

I did have some of my friend's omelet, which was amazing, and I had a side of sausage with my plate of death, so I know this place serves stomachable food. Just stay away from the stuff that legitimately sounds like it could kill you. Because it can."}
{"text":"Yeah, thats right a five freakin star rating.  

Five Star Truck Stop Dining At Its Finest.

Be prepared to eat.  

I was first introduced to the Pine Cone at its Johnson Creek location years ago and freaked out at the size of the awesome, delicious desserts.   Then on a recent road trip someone mentioned about eating at the Pine Cone, I thought is there really more than one?  I looked out the window to see exactly where we were at and it wasn't near Johnson Creek -- when we arrived, and I saw the bakery....I knew I was home.

It was near dinner time so I ordered stuffed chicken breast.  The dinner roll alone is a meal.  I can't say enough about dinner.  Everything is homemade. They don't add alot of salt, if any.  You can tell its fresh.  Its plentiful.  Its cheap.  You literally can stuff yourself for next to nothing.

You can't possibly leave this place without indulging on some bakery goods to take home, IF they can make it home.  In our case, they were safely packed in the trunk for our safety and yours.  The last thing we need to explain to the police is we were under the influence of bakery goods from the Pine Cone."}
{"text":"Excellent food!! Stopped here for breakfast on the way back from the dells and it was fantastic. I had the chicken fried steak and friend had chipped beef. You get a lot of food for your money and our over easy eggs were cooked perfectly!!! Glad we stopped there!!!"}
{"text":"Been here twice in less than a week. Here's the deal. The Pine Cone is a 24 hour truck stop diner. The menu is expansive, covering everything from 2 pages of breakfast items, typical diner staples like club sandwiches and burgers, fish fry, pasta dishes, steaks, chops, fried shrimp.... pretty much anything you can think of. I never go off the beaten path at cozy little diners like this. I always go for the greasy spoon stuff because Pine Cone is a greasy spoon. What's not to love about a small town cozy place with some good grub and speddy service? 

1st Trip- I got a brat with hash browns and sunny side up eggs. Friend got a rueben with fries. We both had no complaints. it was very satisfying. Judging by the texture and of my friend's corned beef on his reuben, I could tell it was fresh and the Pine Cone's corned beef moves quickly. Alot of greesy spoons with 100+ items on the menu serve inedible slices of corned beef with a metalic shimmer on them. NOPE! Not here. Thick slabs of butter tender goodness.

2nd Trip- My friend got the chicken salad club house with fries and I got the rueben since I never got to eat a bite of his on the last visit. It was delicious.

Another thing to note is the incredible bakery section. Try the cinamon rolls. They are to die for. I will definitely be back soon and try more than a cinamon roll next time.

I noticed reviewers write some complaints about Pine Cone so i was skeptical. But, if you stick to the basics like breakfast or something simeple like a burger or sandwich, I can assure you you won't regret it. After all, we all love little cozy diners like this."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here. Slightly crowded space at front of restaurant - the back looked like it was a maybe a little roomier. Delicious hash browns and eggs, Canadian bacon was full of flavor. The cookies are big and tasty. Friendly servers."}
{"text":"Ate a Saturday morning breakfast at the Pine Cone.  Friendly,quick service, normal prices.  But for the new year - the special was all-you-can-eat pancakes for $2.12, I added a breakfast sausage patty ($3.00).  Father had the typical, two eggs, toast, hash-bowns (seem fresh cut), sausage links.  Food was tasty, no major qualms other than - the hash-browns need a bit more cooking and the coffee needs a bit more bite.

very nice assortment of bakes goods - massive - as large as your head cream-puffs, eclairs - I took a blueberry muffin to go - which I enjoyed.  

Quick exit from I-94...just northeast of  Madison"}
{"text":"I normally go here all the time and the service is ok food is decent. but today I decided to have to go. walked in and a blonde girl name brenda I believe was told she was the manager. which surprised me cause when I asked to order to go instead of giving me a menu she told me to go get a menu on the table. I just stood there cause I know I'm not going to get a menu cause that's her job. she then walked away and threw me to someone else to go throw salt outside on the side walk. she has wavy hair, ive seen her  few times there and she is not a friendly person. please find a different job if your not happy doing your job expecially a manager. won't be coming back here any time soon"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints :) love the giant dinner rolls with the yummy Grassland butter. Portions are quite large. The chicken and dumpling soup is delicious! Huge and yummy desserts"}
{"text":"This place is great. I work late nights sometimes and will stop here on the way home. Their chicken fried steak is the best I've ever had and the bakery section is incredible."}
{"text":"We had a awesome meal , I love there Philly Scramble delish.The service was great I don't know how the waitress can carry the plates are heavy and hot,but she was friendly as efficient and the food was great.Place may not have the ambiance but when I go out to eat I want good food and good service and I got what I wanted and more,that pastry counter gets me all the time.  yummy"}
{"text":"Ordered the eggs Benedict and blueberry waffle. Both were yummy. The waffle was super soft like I was biting into pure air fluff. I highly recommend ordering at least one, treat yourself! 

My friend ordered the eggs Benedict with country fried steak, which looked and tasted soooo good. Next time I am totally ordering that with gravy, skip the hollandaise.

So just as you're about to leave after eating all that yummy goodness, you're forced to see the desserts lined up as you walk out. I tried to contain myself, but failed. I ordered a cherry boat (pretty good), lemon bar (ehhh, not my style - straight sugar pudding), and chocolate covered rice krispy treat (delish)."}
{"text":"Some times Jane and Michael Stern are on point and other times the story of the place beats the food.  I would definitely return to the Pine Cone.  It's a bakery and diner attached to a truck stop on the Wisconsin highway.  I live in Chicago and work in a famous Mexican restaurant and I get up to Wisconsin for the old school steak and butter as much as possible: it gives me the energy to do my job.  Pine Cone has eclairs and cream puffs the size of my cat.  And I got a pig cookie.  This little truck stop gives me the big energy to get even deeper into steak and butter territory."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great greasy spoon diner but also makes some of the best desserts in town.

TRY THE COCONUT MACAROONS. OH MY LANTA!

As far as menu items I like to keep it simple with the following options (not in order of ranking, just listed randomly):
-Pine Cone Steak and Eggs
-Combo #1
-Chicken Fried Steak"}
{"text":"We randomly found this place on a road trip to a ski hill in Wisconsin one day. Now, it's a regular stop for us and we actually build it into our itinerary every time we are in the area for any reason. The main draw of this place is the front bakery counter. They make the most mind-blowingly delicious frosted sugar cookies (cow shapes are their trademark, but they have other designs as well) that taste way better than anything you've ever had in your life. The cookies are the perfect texture of just crunchy enough, but still maintaining the soft, doughy inside. The frosting is like crack. You think you're going to just have a small bite, but then you find yourself going back for more and more because it's so dang delicious. They also have gigantic cream puffs that look like an entire can of whipped cream was used to construct each one (although their whipped cream is made from scratch). Oh, and gargantuan chocolate eclairs as well. We sometimes eat at the diner and the food is really delicious as well. Chicken fried steak, hot roast beef sandwiches, burgers, fries, you name it. It's all pretty tasty and full of midwestern goodness. The place is at a truck stop of a giant shell station, and it can be hard to find once you exit, as you enter from the far side, but definitely well worth the stop."}
{"text":"If you like lot lizards, you'll love the Pine Cone!"}
{"text":"Whenever we are in this area we stop here. WE LOVE THIS PLACE! Not a whole bunch of atmosphere,  but food and service is great. Then...at the checkout is the most incredible bakery! Hugh cinnamon  rolls, elephant ears the size of a dinner plate! Do not drive by, you will regret it!"}
{"text":"I like this location better than the one near Johnson's creek.  It is a bit tight when you walk in, but the charm soon takes over.  

I was not really impressed by the food.  However, their pastries won my over.  Try it all!  The pie was delicious.  I went with a simple apple selection.  Delicious, perfection.  It is nothing crazy, no fancy name but truthfully one of the best piece of classic apple you can find around here.  

The service is a little slow but once again, it is a small restaurant with lots of charm.  You get what you get and I love it.  It is near a Christmas tree farm so it is the perfect place to stop and get some cocoa on your way."}
{"text":"First of all, I'll get the obvious out of the way - yes, the baked goods are ridiculous and amazing.

BUT DON'T BE FOOLED.

Pine Cone is so, so much more than 3lb eclairs and bear claws the size of your face. Their food is some of the best diner food I've ever had. I'll be honest and admit that I usually order the same thing (BLT and chicken dumpling soup), but each is an exemplary specimen. BLT with the freshest, crispest veggies, perfectly cooked bacon, and - and here's something so many restaurants fail on - plenty of mayo! Ever notice how so many BLTs are lacking in the mayo department? Not at Pine Cone. A literally perfect sandwich.

Now. About that chicken 'n dumpling soup. Here is, word for word, an actual text message I sent to my boyfriend: \"Do you think if we called ahead, they'd sell us like, a quart of that soup to go? I think it's worth trying.\" Most chefs CAN make chicken soup...not many can make it PERFECTLY. Pine Cone does. Well-made soup is very, very important to me, and something I tend to judge a restaurant on. This soup is perfect - excellent meat/veggie ratio, dumplings that are neither too fluffy nor too chewy, but right in between, just salty enough...I could go on and on, but the bottom line is, if you've never had this soup, you owe it to yourself to go out RIGHT NOW and get some. 

My boyfriend usually gets the biscuits and gravy, and they are also excellent (we eat a lot of those too...). 

Prices are cheap, service is fast, food is unbelievable...that's all there is to it. Get yourself to Pine Cone."}
{"text":"Attention fans of David Lynch.  Do stop by this place.  The atmosphere, staff and patrons will certainly help to make your visit enjoyable.
Last time I was here I ordered the caramel nut covered cinnamon roll.  The waitress asked if I wanted it warmed with some butter.   I thought that sounded even better and said to go ahead and do that.  She nodded agreement.  Then when she brought it to me it was unheated and no butter.   Odd but also kind of humorous.  I always enjoy being in a David Lynch film from time to time.
The service and food is way better than the country restaurant just a mile south on 51.  Be sure to go here instead.   Their booths are made for skinny people from the 50s.   take a table.  start a conversations with the truck driver to your left. 
We used to go to the Pine Cone when it was across the street.  Must be hard times for these guys because the interior appears to be older than what they had when they were on the other side of the street.   That place now sits empty.   Why is this area depressed?   Don't ask me, I don't know.  Do I look like I have all the answers?
The food here is good and the prices are cheap.   Go here for a nice meal and a flash back to the past and don't forget to take home some bakery.  Or if you aren't hungry just stop by for some great baked goods.    Well worth the stop.
This place gets four stars because of their five star bakery selection.  Crazy big cinnamon rolls and good prices.

PS The pecan cinnamon rolls are the best.   The frosted cinnamon rolls are too much frosting in my opinion and too doughy.  The apple fritters are quite good.

Tip.  The entire place is made for skinny people.  If you are heavy set you will not fit in the booths.  Take a seat at the counter.   I am a rather big guy and it took me over an hour to squeeze myself out of the bathroom.  (just kidding)   But it is tiny all around.  A reflection of times past."}
{"text":"Great truck stop restaurant.  I've had breakfast and dinner here and it has always been good.  Huge portions and reasonable prices.  The bakery I guess is legendary.  They have doughnuts the size of your head!  Eclairs the size of your arm and Cream Puffs that are about 10\" high.  On our most recent trip in the area, stopped at the gas station attached to the restaurant fo some quick snacks and of course BAKERY.

If you are driving by and see the sign for The Pine Cone Restaurant - Take the next off ramp and stop it."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food isn't the best, but it certainly isn't bad. Their dinner rolls are amazing though. The food is well priced and the portions are huge.

The real reason why I love this place is for the environment. It's far enough away from downtown that it's almost never busy at night. The waitresses are always fantastic. Some can be slow from time to time, but usually they're obviously busy with other things.

The average clientele tend to give my friends and I a weird look or piercing glare, but they've never been rude to me. Some of the teens who come here can get a bit rowdy at night, but it's never that bad.

I really adore coming here between 11PM-3AM with my boyfriend or some friends to play a card game and relax. Something nice about knowing you're not going to run into anyone you know.

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes real diners."}
{"text":"I kinda like this place a lot.
Nothing fancy but solid diner menu with good baked goods. 
Love the fresh hot  dinner rolls and breakfast lunch or dinner specials or off menu is equally tasty with generous portion. Maybe not healthiest food or greatest atmosphere but darn good grub and  friendly service"}
{"text":"Nice diner feel, very friendly staff, desserts look amazing, but the food....just tastes like grease....coated in grease....bummer."}
{"text":"One of my favorite truck stop diners with solid food and friendly, quick service. My god, those desserts are huge! I can't imagine eating that giant cream puff. 
All the food we had was delicious and I love how they leave a carafe of coffee on the table. Love this place. Would definitely be back if I was in the area!"}
{"text":"i rarely give five star reviews but for what this restaurant is, it's pretty perfect.  i've only eaten breakfast here (twice in the last three weeks) and the eggs are cooked perfectly, the sourdough toast is made in the kitchen and is delicious, and the bacon was perfectly crispy.  the hashbrowns are the best i've had in a long time - perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy inside.  the pancakes are huge and light and amazing.  the cinnamon rolls taste just as good as they look.

prices are right on, baked goods are pretty great.  service is fast and friendly - really fast.  i haven't had to wait more than 5 minutes to get my meal.  i might be in the honeymoon phase, but perfectly cooked poached eggs or over easy eggs are hard to come by!  it shouldn't be an anomaly to discover well cooked food, but i suppose it is.  sure it's a \"greasy spoon\" but how many greasy spoons bake their own bread?  can't recommend this place enough for great breakfasts."}
{"text":"This place is the worst. I was charged twice for my food and management did nothing for me. I will never step foot in here again."}
{"text":"This is the standard for a 24 hr place. Everything is outstanding. Baked goods and all made from scratch. You can't find one thing that ain't delicious. What a great place to eat. 
Outstanding."}
{"text":"Lord tell me why I came into this place thinking they were going to feed me with a normal size portion. When I say they came out with am enough food for 4 people, I'm not joking. Hanna waited on us. Great service and good food."}
{"text":"We ordered the blueberry fritter French toast. Made with real/whole blueberries. It was huge and delicious. Surprising sweet without being too sweet. The breakfast menu is very diverse and there are tons of choices. 

Plenty of seating and it's very clean. Easy on/off the interstate. An excellent choice for locals & travelers."}
{"text":"Love this place. Always have. 

I worked here in my teens and can confirm everything is home made and with care. 

Their bakery is like nothing else ive ever seen. Gigantic protions, any and every sweet tooth satisfied, and prices are great. 

Waitresses are hit or miss however. Sometimes a very helpful one will cross your path and other times you suffer from the 'I hate my life' 40 yr olds. 

Either way. Everything from the Ruben to chicken fried steak is always amazing."}
{"text":"Hmmm I am conflicted. I could tell you about the best carmel apples that I have ever had-so big, so carmelly, so juicy. Or I could tell you about how the grease they fry their food in makes your food....unpleasant.

I love their giant, fluffy dinner rolls. 

I dislike how wet the fries are and their taste is so bland yet so greasy. Their onion rings are disappointment, pretty much everywhere else has better o-rings. I've gotten sick from their chicken tenders and their chicken sandwich is also bland and greasy.

The cinnamon roll french toast is delicious and sweet. The bacon is typically too crispy for my taste.

My mother once ordered the roast beef and uhmmm I even lost my appetite. 

While they give you lots of food, it's pretty flavorless and greasy. You can get a ginormous pastry, that's really the way to go.

Oh one time I asked for a hot dog kid's meal and the waitress refused me. Hey you it'll be the same price if I order a salad and a roll, why not just let me have a hot dog. But nope, :("}
{"text":"I will have a hard time returning to this restaurant after a run in with the manager/owner this morning. What an obnoxious, customer unfriendly person. When I said my eggs were not cooked enough he said I shouldn't spend so much time on my phone and learn how to order properly? I have been ordering my eggs at this very same restaurant this very same way for over 40 years! What does checking my messages on my phone  after I have ordered have anything to do with how my eggs are cooked. He made several other snide remarks and when I said maybe he didn't need my business anymore, he said he didn't. The food has never been great but it has been a convenient stop.Talking with the truck stop management they noted they have had numerous complaints about him but that the restaurant is not owned by the truckstop. I wouldn't even give this place one star. Leastwise if I don't patronize this place anymore I won't have to gag everytime I use the ladies room which smells like a sewer."}
{"text":"Wow! A hidden gem. Best bakery. 
Had the giant cow cookie, under $3. Great flavor. The pig cookie is super cute. 

The giant cinnamon roll is nothing like I have ever seen before. It is gigantic and very good. 

The pumpkin square with cream crease frosting is wonderful. And the size is enormous! 

The dinner rolls are sweet tasting and huge! It's a meal in its self. 

This is worth the stop off the highway."}
{"text":"If you are hungry for comfort food this is the place for you! Delicious homemade entrees and baked goods await you. Try the apple fritter french toast, burgers, or stuffed chicken with gravy. Save room for desert!"}
{"text":"The baked goods are definitely the main draw to Pine Cone. The breakfast dishes were good, not great. The hashed browns were terrific...crispy but not greasy."}
{"text":"Don't treat this like a upscale restaurant by looking at the seating and ambience
Don't even treat this place like a sit down restaurant to take your girl out
This is a truckstop restaurant with a bakery for the locals or for you if you're into that
I'm not, don't have a sweet tooth so I can't and won't comment on the desserts
If however you're looking for a hearty delicious breakfast omelette then this is for you 
I had the philly cheese steak omelette with extra jalapeño and I can tell you it was just fantastic
No overwhelming cheese and steak chunks cut to the right size made my breakfast perfect 
I will definitely be back for more that's for sure"}
{"text":"This place was excellent. We were a little nervous because it is in a truck stop but the food was absolutely delicious and the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Hungry!  We stopped in and decided to stay for breakfast. It's a Sunday so they were very busy but we got a small corner table. We both had corned beef hash with scrambled eggs, and I had coffee. The waitress brought me a pot of coffee! I felt bad I only drank 3 cups of it! lol  we have been to the other location a couple times about 5 years or so ago. They are both tasty! I do have to say, I wasn't crazy about the donuts, the oil needed changed or something, just tasted off.  But hey! Try them anyway! The cinnamon rolls & pecan rolls look incredible as does pretty much everything in the case.  We will stop again if in the area.  GO DUCKS!!!"}
{"text":"This place is great
Great food and excellent service and 24 hours I will come back as often as possible"}
{"text":"Hot turkey sandwich was just ok. The mushroom soup was super thick and tasted like flour. We sat in a booth a bigot truck driver decided he should talk to us. All in all the entire experience wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Good truck stop dining at the right price. We love coming here on the weekends when we don't feel like cooking."}
