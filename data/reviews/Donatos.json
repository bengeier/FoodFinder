{"text":"Great, consistent pizza -- Unique thin crispy crust, you've gotta try it!  Service can be slow during the day, but what do you expect at an uptown lunch joint?  Slices to go are the best deal."}
{"text":"Since the time of the other reviews there has been a change in the General Manager which I believe has GREATLY improved service.  Donatos also has exceptional offers that meet or exceed the other pizza place !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"i love Donatos, it's my favorite pizza! i have been to many different Donatos locations and always have a great experience. if you're looking for great pizza it's definitely worth a try. my favorite pizzas are the founders favorite and peperoni. i am not a big fan of their cheese pizza, it's kind of bland. and i recommend always getting the thin crust."}
{"text":"I order from Donato's at least once a week, and unfortunately this location screws up my order more often than not.  When I call to complain its hit or miss whether I get a manager who will take the appropriate action and give good customer service. Tonight when I ordered a salad for my daughter with no nuts or cheese, I of course got one with. All I heard from the manager was a \"sorry, next time maybe order by phone instead of the Internet\".  Obviously, from the other reviews this place still hasn't gotten it together in the 4 years that it's been open! @donatos"}
{"text":"Donatos would have received three stars except the management is horrible. I have always had a positive experience at Donatos and have always enjoyed the food. It isn't the greatest pizza in Charlotte but it is certainly not the worst. My mother, however, has not had the same experience. 

My mother has a hangup with pepperonis. She likes them but she doesn't LOVE them. Everytime she orders her usual pepperoni and onion pizza she always specifies light on the pepperonis. She had never been to Donatos and was unfamiliar with their obsession with pepperonis. She called in her order and told the girl on the phone that she wanted 25 percent of the pepperonis they typically use on their \"edge to edge\" pepperoni pizza. She picked the pizza up and brought it home to find that they had given her an edge to edge pepperoni pizza. She promptly returned the pizza and politely asked to speak to a manager about the situation. She explained the situation and he acted like she had lobsters crawling out of her ears. He was unwilling to remake her pizza and even shared a laugh at her expense with a fellow patron who couldn't understand why my mother would not want 500 pepperonis on her pizza. She called the district manager and complained about the general manager but has not been back to Donatos since. 

I don't know if this will change your opinion or not but even though Donatos has decent pizza, they clearly have issues with customer service."}
{"text":"Here we go again, with a place I've only heard rave reviews of. This time it was my boss, who's from Ohio, blah, blah blahing about how great Donato's is. And he wasn't the only one, I'd also heard it from quite a few of my other Friends who all were from Ohio too. Maybe Donato's is actually good in Ohio? Maybe? Either way the one here in Charlotte is not my style. I'm a New York Pizza kind of guy, I like my slices long, greasy and cheesy with a few Pepperoni, lets say ten per slice to be generous, I like the crust to be soft and doughty and thin, but not crispy. 

I wasn't feeling the thin crispy crust, or the weird square slices. And way, way too much pepperoni. 

There were some good things though. It wasn't all bad. The crust though too thin and crispy for my taste did have a nice buttery texture and plenty of flavor. You can tell the guys at Donato's know what they're doing, its nothing against them, its just not the kind of pizza I like. Try it for yourself and let me know what you think, I've got an open mind."}
{"text":"\"You Can't Always Get What You Want \" used to be the song I sang when thinking of Donato's. I craved it all the time yet it hadn't made its way down to NC yet but insisted my sister order it every time I went up to Indiana. Fast forward a few years and we have it in Charlotte-woo hoo! Except I didn't have it until tonight. Not in the mood to cook, I took the lazy way out and ordered online.

I didn't want a huge pizza but ordered two individual pizzas (one so I can enjoy later this wk) and love that you can get the think crust on the individuals as well. Got the confirmation email from them-order would be ready in 15 minutes for pick up and bam, it was in my hands 15 minutes later. Still the same gooey, cheesy, heavenly pie that I've been accustomed to in the past. They offer mad coupons in the Wednesday flier and have a few coupons in the Citipass book as well."}
{"text":"I know Donatos is a chain, but I continue to be impressed by this particular location on Park Road. Located next to Ed's Tavern, they have great specials. $8.99 bakery style pizza with 3 toppings. Think pan style pizza. 16 square slices for $9?! Awesome. For take out, expect 15 min and delivery 30 min. That's for Southend area. Staff is friendly too."}
{"text":"I once managed a very busy, very new pizza place. I understand there are always kinks to work out, and this can be tough especially when someone accidentally drives a car through your storefront earlier that day. But there is no excuse for the only guests in your restaurant to have to wait 25 minutes for 2 one-topping pizzas, a non-functioning soda fountain, and pizza that tastes like but is twice as expensive as Domino's, located in the same shopping center. Sorry, guys."}
{"text":"My friends and I decided to try out the new Donatos location at Gateway Village. We got pizza to go and took it home for a VP debate watch party. I generally have low expectations for all pizza in Charlotte, but I was pleasantly surprised by Donatos. We all agreed the sauce had really good flavor, and the crust and pepperoni were crispy. 

I was just checking out the Donatos web site and noticed that you can order online for pickup or delivery. That convenience is a big plus, and I wish more places had online ordering."}
{"text":"Bye Bye Donatos.  I never thought you would last.  Nothing in the space does but apparently poor service was more your problem along with an outdated GPS system ...must have been a very early model because my neighborhood was built in the 1970s and your online ordering service marked it as an invalid address.

Goodbye Donatos.  I am sort of glad you didn't last."}
{"text":"Third times a charm??? Well, no.

OK the first time was opening weekend, so the service was whack. Our party had ordered Stromboli, individual pizza, and a meatball sub. For starters I had ordered a small side salad and my friend ordered some cheesy garlic bread. The first thing out? The meatball sub. 10 mins later the garlic bread... then 10 mins after that the entrees, and after asking 4 different people I finally got my starter side salad after I finished my pizza! OK, so everyone said the food was decent, well except for my friend with the meatball sub, but he never likes anything so I can't really count him. The individual pizza was pretty good. I had crispy with pepperoni, pineapple and red onions. 

So the next time was during the week for lunch. I called in my order on my way home from lunch. I ordered the same individual pizza again. I had a 20 minute drive from work, so I figured it would be ready. I get to the store to pick up my lil pizza and a 105 year old lady was working the register. It took her 10 mins to ring me up. Srsly!!! Then she was just holding on to my debit card the whole time.. that bugs me for some reason. I actually had to ask 3 times for her to hand me my card back.. apparently she can't hear very well?

Third time's a charm???.. nope. Me and hubby were starving after bowling and decided to call in a pizza to pick up. See this place is like one block from our house, so that's why we decided to give them another chance, plus the pizza is actually decent, just the service is crap. So we called in our order which took 10 mins on the phone.. should have took that as a sign not to continue. Hubby had to repeat order 3 times and was put on hold at least 5 times during ordering ONE pizza! OK, drive 20 minutes to pick up pizza, hubby runs in and waits.. and waits.. and waits. I'm trying to practice my patience skills so I think perhaps I am being irrational, but then I start timing our wait. Yep, 20 mins he's in store waiting... add that to the 20 minute drive and that's 40 minutes for a call in... and they don't look too busy to me. Apparently they sent our pizza out with the delivery guy.. oh, they didn't tell us this... my hubby just observed their behavior. They started freaking out and whispering when he asked the status of our pie. They started shuffling and making a new one really fast. Seems they were too busy playing around throwing things at each other in the kitchen to pay attention to what they were doing with the completed pizzas, this I saw from the parking lot. I called hubbs from parking lot and asked if he had already paid, when he said no I told him to walk out. Screw that! I could have picked up a frozen pizza from the grocery store, properly pre-heated my oven and baked it at home all before getting my already called in order! SRSLY!!!!

The pizza is decent, but I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Where to start?  I guess I'll start at the entrance.  Donatos shares a building with Bojangles.  Maybe \"building\" isn't the correct term, but hopefully it makes sense.  That is a problem, because when you come in, you're just about smacked in the face by the menu, which is up on a wall.  Not above the counter, but right in front of you - the counter is off to the side.  This can be an issue because people waiting for food to go seem like they choose this area to stand, meaning you can't get a good look at the menu (which, as I mentioned is right in front of you in the first place).  Strike one.

The staff is helpful - they offer to hand you a menu - but as with many places where you order at a counter, looking through a menu in your hands with people waiting isn't a great idea.  Being able to look at something larger and make a semi-informed decision would really help here.  Strike two.

Next up is the seating (should you choose to eat in).  There are a grand total of twelve tables for two, which can be moved around somewhat if you are able, so you can make tables for four, six, etc. if others aren't using them.  But if you can do the math, that's seating for 24 people, shared between Bojangles and Donatos.  Add to that the fact that service is not fast - it took upwards of ten minutes to get my sub, and others who ordered before I did took even longer.  Strike three.

As to the food: It wasn't bad.  My sandwich was not huge - think a large ciabatta bun from Jack-in-the-Box, with a reasonable amount of meat and toppings.  The only problem is that I ordered it without lettuce, and it came with lettuce, as well as a monstrous dollop of mayo, most of which was removed when I removed the lettuce.  But the flavor wasn't bad.  The pizzas looked okay, if a bit on the thin side.  I also had a cookie, which was okay but for a crust that tasted a bit burnt.

The staff was helpful, except for being a bit on the slow side - since they were overstaffed and the oven-cooking took so long, they could probably cut back.  And since the credit card machine spit out a receipt that prompts for tips, it ticked me off a bit.  Also, pre-made salads in the cooler is a bit off-putting.  Pizzas and subs are definitely the way to go here."}
{"text":"I had horribly late Donatos pizza about a month ago. The highlight was a conversation on the phone with Justin (Manager) that led me to believe that he hates his life.

I called corporate and left a message detailing the problem, but they never got back to me."}
