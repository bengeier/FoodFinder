{"text":"We enjoyed the Moscoto wine and the house salad which was enough for both of us.  This is certainly a nice place that I'm looking forward to coming back to."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some of the best pizza in town, you've got to visit this place! I can't speak for any of the chain stores but this is a hidden treasure in Gilbert! Off the beaten path, I think they rely on the locals a lot and offer some of the best customer service around!
Fantastic customer service and it's truly a friendly smile from everyone in the place! They are all making sure you're a happy camper!
3x the tip for this service!"}
{"text":"i have been going here for years now and even with Lou Malnatis opening 2 miles from my home i would rather make the 30 min drive to salernos.  i know people say chicago pizza is deep dish but really for me it is not.  i never had deep dish unless we went to lous or unos or giordanos. if your looking for true chicago pizza go to salernos order a thin crust with sausage. their sausage is the same as it was at their original shop in chicago. what i like most. you never have to order extra cheese. they put on the perfect amount. my wife is a vegetarian and the only time she eats meat is when we order a pizza from salernos.  the place is no frills. if your looking for a place with trendy signs and fancy decor this place is not it. it is clean and well kept but its a pizza shop. if your from the midwest or chicago... you will love this place. prices are not high. 22 bucks for an extra large pizza with great cheese and hand made sausage is a fair price.  i have tried almost every single pizza joint in the valley and salernos is still the best by a long shot."}
{"text":"We went here for my son's 21st birthday. Honestly, it was the best pizza I've ever had! The cheese is the best! To me, even better than Oregano's!  They make their Italian sausage homemade, incredibly tasty!

Maybe the most impressive thing is what they did after making a mistake. I ordered two pizzas, one thin crust and the other Chicago style. They delivered both as thin crust. They were incredibly apologetic and insisted on making us another one on Chicago crust as I had originally ordered. They gave us the thin crust pizza they had made by mistake for FREE and topped it off by serving us four free Cannolis, too!  Delicious!

Sometimes, it's not doing everything perfectly, but what one does to make up for a mistake.  Salerno's did this very well!  We'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"To all who read this please head this warning and DO NOT EAT HERE.  BEWARE.....I read a few reviews on here before visiting and disregarded the negative reviews.  I ignored the warning signs and took my family here for dinner.  Virtually every negative review is accurate.  

The food quality is very bad, ingredients are highly processed or canned and every dish including the pizza was water boarded with oil.  

My review simply is to STAY AWAY......"}
{"text":"The only thing that was appealing was it was family owned. Ravioli was cold in the center and in general was not good. My salad was a head of lettuce. Wanted to try this restaurant for a very long time. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Tried this tonight for the first time even though we have been in the neighborhood for 7 years.  The combo sandwich was great.  I was a little surprised at the cost but after getting home (I got take out) I saw one sandwich was enough for two people.  The nice young man even brought my food outside for me!  I will definitely be going back and I am looking forward to dining in with my family one night very soon.  I wonder what dessert will be???"}
{"text":"Yes, Chicago Pizza Fans, there is a Salerno's in Arizona. If you are in the area, we suggest that you stop in and taste some of the best pizza that we have had in the Chicagoland area. They relocated to Arizona much to our surprise but when we found out they were there we made a beeline for a taste of the pizza that we have enjoyed in years past. Salerno's had an original store in the Berwyn, Cicero area of Illinois. Best tasting pizza, huge pieces filled with cheese, great sausage and a delicious tomato sauce. YES, stop in and get a taste of Chicago style pizza. We enjoyed it for years and I am sure that if you give it a try, you will enjoy it also."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago to use a groupon we had. We were very surprised on how good everything was. We had a sausage pizza that was incredible. I would recommend anything with their homemade sausage. We also had the roast beef sandwich and it was good but nothing compared to the pizza. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza in the valley. 
Straight outta Berwyn, Illinois....Salernos isn't about the frills and crap like these deep dish places who are just coming to phoenix. 
I recommend salernos to anyone who wants a real Chicago neighborhood pizzeria."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! Love this place. Super friendly staff  and always great service! Highly recommend this family business!"}
{"text":"Being from Berwyn,Chicago I was excited to try this place.  I have had many pizzas in my days, many great Chicago style and many great ones from other places.  I can honestly say this is amongst the worst pizzas I have had in a long time.  The thin crust was not thin but about 1/2 inch thick, in the middle of pizza crust no mans land.  It was bland and tasteless.  I was going to compare the crust to cardboard, but that's not fair to cardboard. The only thing worse than the crust was the glob of cheese that literally slid off the pizza.  At least the pizza could be salvaged as I alway love eating a pizza cut in squares.  Wrong.  Each slice was cut into 1 by 4 inch strips.  Certainly won't be going back as too many other better options around, i.e. Rosatis, Spinatos."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite Italian Restaurant! The staff was so friendly! They made us feel so welcome and wanting to come back again! We tried the Calamari, Lasagna, Ravioli,  Bruschetta and Cannoli. The Ravioli was amazing!! And it was the first time I ever had Cannoli! It was delicious!! They make their own bread that is served with their meals and it was soooo good!! Handmade each day! I highly recommend this place, but you might want to call ahead and make a reservation."}
{"text":"Frozen crust.  Too bad.  I am from Chicago and wanted to have a nice medium thick type crust that new yorkers wouldnt understand.  Sure enough they had it but it was a frozen crust for sure, half raw.  Too  bad because the sauce is good, the italian sausage is good, but the frozen crust is shooting themselves in the foot.  Hand toss it like its suppose to be done."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place, I really do, but I'm definitely stuck right now in the category of \"maybe I just got the wrong thing\". Probably serves me right for ordering a pasta dish when all the Yelpers are raving about the pizza, but the pasta, while not bad, was only satisfactory. Next time (and there will be a next time) I'm ordering the pizza. 

Salerno's is definitely a friendly place. While it seemed busy, we were able to get seated right away on a Friday night. My dad taught me to judge a restaurant by how fast waiters refill your water glass (long before the days of Yelp) and if I were going by my dad's standards, this place would get more stars. Their young staff was very attentive and quick to serve. Water was always full. Parking was easy too."}
{"text":"We love eating at Salerno's for a taste of home! As a kid, my parents use to take me to the original location in Berwyn, so it brings back lots of memories for me. We don't like many pizza places in AZ, so when Salerno's opened we were thrilled! It tastes just like I remember. The pizza is very cheesy, great sausage, and vegetables are fresh. The antipasto salad is delicious with authentic Italian dressing. Even though this location is a bit far from our house, we make the drive because it is always worth it! I'll admit it's not much on atmosphere, but that's not why we go there."}
{"text":"After reading some of these reviews I really felt like I needed to do a review.  I am from the Chicago area and love really great pizza..   I moved to Mesa from Barrington, IL about 9 years ago.  I had totally given up on finding good pizza but I can tell you I love this pizza.  I really feel like I am back in Chicago, which everyone knows has the best pizza.  I do not care about the atmosphere.. just good pizza.  I can truly give a solid 5 star to this place.."}
{"text":"I have been to this establishment numerous times trying a variety of the menu. There isn't a dish that I have not liked! Every day, they make the cheese ravioli and the red sauce in house, which is the best in the city by far! Typically this is what I ordered, but the chicken Alfredo with broccoli was by far the richest, most delicious I have had. 
The staff is courteous and always values a return visit - even asking if I want my usual glass of Cabernet. My boyfriend and I will gladly be returning for not only a bowl of the amazing minestrone, but also for the exceptional service!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try this place on a Saturday night. The place is small and looks out into the parking lot. I liked the murals on the wall, but did not like sitting in the middle of the restaurant and the push carts the staff uses. My hubby had the pork tenderloin and pasta. Big portions but marinara sauce was plain. I ordered the Chicago style pizza. The crust was thick and the pizza cheesy. Not the best I have had but it was good."}
{"text":"The owner and operator of Salerno's is one of the most arrogant jerks I've ever met. We came into his restaurant to use a coupon that had been expired for a few days, and instead of honoring the coupon or giving us some kind of partial discount, he chose to not honor the coupon and tell us to leave the restaurant. You never know the kind of true colors an owner has until this type of situation, unfortunately, he is the worst - treating a paying customer like crap with unnecessary verbal assaults. He is exactly the type of person that should never receive your business."}
{"text":"I had never tried the Berwyn IL location, but since I'm from the Chicago area, I thought I try Salerno's.  What a pleasant surprise.  I prefer the thin over the thicker crust though.  You don't go for the atmosphere, you go for the hearty portions and tasty pizza.  The kids size portions are huge and the staff is friendly.  Pizza is excellent!  I drive 15 mins to get this pizza and pass several other pizza joints along the way that I've tried. Good food, good prices.  Pizza done right!!"}
{"text":"Went dinner with my kids on Friday. 
Owner/manager walk whole restaurant and introduced himself 3 times.
Except our table, we were the only color people in whole restaurant. 
The food I ordered was so bad I could not even eat more than two bits.
It was worse dinning out experience in my life.
Just simply bad all the ways around.
Too bad!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza outside of Chicago.  Great service too.  I rarely write reviews for restaurants,  but Salerno's is outstanding!"}
{"text":"First timers last night.  We've been missing real pizza since we moved from Northern Indiana almost 3 years ago.  Salerno's is the closest and best by far in the greater PHX area.  I have a new favorite.  Best sauce.  Great cheese.  Crust is a bit different than I wanted.  But only lost 1 star because of it.  Love the staff too.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Most amazing Italian food I've ever had at a restaurant. The pink sauce is to die for"}
{"text":"Met up there with friends last night. The food was great. Service was very good. Everyone had something different and all were very pleased. The pizza going by looked fantastic. Can't wait to go back and try it."}
{"text":"We have eaten here at least 5-6 times now. We've always ordered the Chicago style pizza.  We do love it!  I have not tried any of the pasta dishes - honestly, I would have a hard time paying the prices they charge for them. We've brought my parents with us a couple of times, and we've never been able to completely finish the large pizza. It is a lot of food!  Our fav combination is Italian beef, artichokes, tomatoes, and black olives. I've seen reviews where they don't like the cheese covering the toppings.  Well - that is my favorite part!  Service has been pretty good (4 out of 5 stars). I don't mind the less expensive looking tables and chairs, although I can see why some people may not like them. I think it is definitely worth a shot - go for the Chicago style pizza. If you don't like it, then at least you tried it!  Chances are you'll like it!"}
{"text":"We had a thin crust sausage pizza and it was amazing! Felt like we were back home in Chicago... The staff are also very friendly we will be back! Best pizza around here!!!  
My only issue is the lighting is kinda annoying. It shines right in your eyes and it seems to be the same at every table."}
{"text":"We have been going to Salerno's for a number of years now and their pizzas ARE the BEST in all of Phoenix. 

Their sausage is MADE FROM SCRATCH, as well as their crusts. My mouth is literally watering right now wishing I could have some today !!!

I am an EXTREMELY SATISFIED AMD LOYAL CUSTOMER!!!"}
{"text":"The salad the hubbie and I split (antipasto) was different from others in that it was mostly lettuce, but we liked that.  It was swimming in dressing, so I would order it again w/ the dressing on the side.

The pizza...tried the thin crust and I did not care for it because the dough was too tough for my taste.  The hubbie who is from Chicago said that it was true to a Chicago style where the dough is more chewy.  I couldn't even cut it w/ a dinner knife.

My favorite Chicago style pizza is deep dish.  Since there is no Gino's East, I will continue to get my deep dish craving taken care of by Rosati's dine-in location on McQueen and Ray.  When I want thin crust, it's gonna be either Rosati's or Oregano's wheat crust."}
{"text":"If this is what Chicago pizza really is, then I think it's time to move to the Windy City. While the pizza at Salerno's is not the best I have ever had it is certainly in the top 5. A crust that can actually support the weight of its ingredients and more of everything (except sauce and that's a good thing) than any pizza you can find in the Valley. If you can consume an entire Large pizza by your self from any other pizzeria in town then be sure to order a SMALL at Salerno's! I'd bet you would still have slices left over, I certainly did.

The restaurant is not high class by any stretch, it made me think it had opened in a rush only last week instead having been in place for 6 years! But that's ok, what it lacks in ambiance it makes up for in good food. The garlic bread is crispy and tasty, the Calzone which the menu says will serve 1-2 people, in reality could make a fine meal for 4 with out much problem.

The pizza benefited greatly from a touch of salty parm but that is really my own taste shining through.

While this is not the most inexpensive pizza in town it is without doubt one of the best, and certainly the finest example of Chicago Style to be found here.

We are looking forward to trying the veal and other wonderful sounding and looking Italian dishes on the menu.

Do your self a great favor and give Salerno's a try. It is worth the trip."}
{"text":"Had company in from Minnesota. They wanted Pizza. Took a chance and gave Salerno's a try. It was a very good choice. Very friendly/attentive staff, pizza was Great and the price was not out of line. Our company agreed and were very satisfied with the whole experience. Noticed some of the other offerings being served around us, we will be back to try out some of these offerings for sure!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best little Italian Restaurants. Their food is excellent their service is outstanding. Plus their gluten free pizza is awesome."}
{"text":"Just picked up 2-pizzas from Salerno's for my family while we are in town after reading previous reviews. Extremely satisfied, they had never had Chicago style pizza, they enjoyed it as well. Can't wait until we visit again. Thank you for the taste of home."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza!  We bought a large 3 item pizza the week before Christmas for about $29, so not cheap, but well worth the cost.  You can really taste the quality ingredients.  We liked it so much we ordered another one two days later.  Since there was plenty left over, we actually had pizza 4 nights in a row.  OK, not good for us, but it sure was tasty.  We promise to eat more salad this year :)"}
{"text":"We are long time fans of Salernos pizza. Went to the one in Berwyn for 40 years and also the St. Charles, IL. site. The Gilbert site is equally great. Ask for the thin crust pizza if you don't like thick dough. It is our favorite and the best pizza around plus the homemade sausage is fresh & tasty. The Mom & Pop Salerno still oversee the food in the back and the home made cannoli are excellent truly Itallian. We drive an hour to savor the great taste of Salernos thin crust pizza."}
{"text":"So good!!!! If you ain't been here....it is a must!!! Seriously,  been trying to make it here for a while and here I am! Best service ever too!"}
{"text":"Not good.  We ordered pizza, salad, and lasagna. Nothing great about the pizza at all, the lasagna tasted good, however the next day was horrible.  When I was eating it I actually had second thoughts about the quality, the meat looked like mush. I paid for it horribly the next day. I will never eat here again.  Totally reminds me of a restaurant that would be on Chef Ramsey's kitchen nightmares. Inside of restaurant is very dirty and outdated."}
{"text":"Soooo disappointed. This is not what I think of when I hear Chicago-style pizza. This was a thick-ish crust. True Chi town pizza is pan style with the toppings below the cheese, and sauce over top of it all. If that's what you want, don't go here. We started with wings which were still raw in the middle. We didn't make a huge fuss, and they were very apologetic and brought a new order right away, though with the wrong sauce. Our server disappeared before we figured that out and never came back until our pizza was ready. We ate them anyway as we were hungry, and they took them off our bill, so no biggie. 
We'd ordered sausage and pepperoni Chicago style pizza, and all I can say is the cheese was very good. I used to work at a pizza place, and can tell good cheese from cheap cheese. Something tasted off-  maybe the sauce, which was very thin and runny, was too acidic? Or the sausage was bad, I'm not sure. Almost inedible. Despite friendly servers, we won't be back. The hunt for true Chicago style Pizza in the valley continues."}
{"text":"We are beyond impressed with the catering service from Salerno's. Angela and her team did a phenomenal job. Leading up to the event, Angela was always available to answer questions and make last minute changes. Salerno's has a partnership with a rental company, Y-Knot rentals, so my linens were taken care of by Angela/Salerno's. They did the payment, pick-up, and return for the linen rentals. It was definitely nice to cross that chore off of my to-do list and put it in Angela's hands. Amazing! During the event, Angela and her staff were extremely kind and helpful. The staff was constantly scanning the dining room for empty plates and water glasses. They arrived several hours before the reception started, helped with setting up, and stayed for a quick and organized clean-up. The food was amazing and got a lot of great feedback from our guests. Overall, we could not be any happier with our experience with Salerno's for our wedding. Delicious food, fantastic staff, and a stress-free planning experience. They have earned lifetime business from us at their local Gilbert restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been going to Salerno's for years but finally got around to writing a review. In my opinion the restaurant can be hit or miss and usually miss with the service recently. To me Salerno's is an Arizona version of Chicago style pizza. The pizzas are sometimes super greasy which is not like what you'd get at a Chicago style pizza place. They also don't have a deep dish/thick crust pizza that you'd find in Chicago at like Lou Malnati's or Giordano's. That being said, their pizza is still one of my favorite \"Chicago style\" in Arizona. The one huge complaint I have about the restaurant is that the ventilation sucks. You end up smelling like the restaurant for the rest of the day unless you change your clothes or shower."}
{"text":"Ordered a lasagna from them, gotta give them an hour and half to have it prepared . It was pretty good kinda like a frozen lasagna. My son and husband both enjoyed it. Grateful that they deliver now"}
{"text":"I am Italian. I have a hard time finding good Italian. Especially in Gilbert. I have never stopped here because of the Pizzeria sign thinking it was just pizza. My hubby decided to take me as a surprise for my birthday and WOW! The pasta was amazing. The tiramisu was so authentic and delicious. Even the pizza was Chicago style delicious! The owners were friendly and wonderful and the waitress was a blast. Great experience all around. I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"If you are a fan of \"REAL\" Chicago style pizza you must come here. Having grown up 90 miles from Chicago I spent a lot of time there. And I have eaten quite a few pizza's there. Lot's of places claim authentic Chicago style but this place delivers. Friends of ours from Chicago recommended this place to us. Said everything was very authentic.
It is excellent and authentic. We were not disappointed. We ordered a 12\" and we had to take about half home. Next time I think it will be baby pizza's for us.
The cheese is heavy and the crust is thick and crunchy on the bottom. As it should be. My wife is a thin crust girl but I said we were going Chicago style. She LOVED it even she was surprised.
I can't wait to go back and try everything on their menu."}
{"text":"This place is like a more \"restaurant version\" of Casanova's Brother's pizza. Salerno's restaurant was definitely very casual, but I'm casual, so it suited me well; my family is white-trash-casual, and to them, it was probably a nice change from Filiberto's.  

The carts they deliver the food on need to go! We are not in a nursing home, we are eating a nice Italian meal. I've seen this in other reviews, so owners- maybe you should take our friendly advice. :-)

The food though, now that's what everyone cares about. I got the cheese ravioli, which were delicious, and were a large serving. In fact- everyone got large portions and 5/6 of us took home leftovers. My husband got the veal and he loved it. Everything we had was awesome- and the salads and bread before the meal were great starters."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza but other food is meh.

The first time we went, we ordered bruschetta which was terrible -- it was like store bought garlic Texas toast with salsa on top. Maybe we came on a bad night! Who knows. Anyway,  We went into our main course with a salty taste in our mouths (literally the bruschetta was very salty). 

However, our feelings quickly turned around when we got our pizza. The crust was nice and thick. The flavor was spot on. The toppings were hearty. We now go there frequently (making sure to not try other appetizers).

The setting is ok. It is a step or two above a diner. The staff was attentive and helpful. The prices are excellent for the amount of food you get. We go regularly, sticking to pizza and always bring a few lunch's worth home :)"}
{"text":"I've read many good reviews about Salerno\"s and I've come to a realization...don't believe what others write !
Fathers day brought me to this restaurant and so did my daughter, the place sits in a strip mall and the inside is rather depressing.
We were seated and it was extremely warm inside...we were approached by the wait staff and I questioned the temperature inside and she shrugged her shoulders. I decided to have a glass of wine, I usually buy a bottle but I was the only one drinking. I asked the wait staff if wine was a good seller here and she responded, \"You ask a lot of questions: I responded jokingly \" You haven't heard them yet \" Her response was \"oh shit\" Oh well what do you expect, we were in a strip mall.
The salad that paired up with the main entree was boring like the decor, warm spring mix with a few limp shredded carrots slivers. That\"s it folks !

We ordered ravioli and I also ordered a meatball and Italian sausage which was forgotten when the raviolis were served. We also ordered a small pizza with eggplant and anchovy . The pizza served to us was minus the anchovy and when I kindly brought it to the servers attention, her response was \" You're shitting me\"  No I wasn't there wasn't any. She told me she would comp the pie, nice gesture but I didn't come for a free meal, I'm lying, Fathers day, meal on daughter. None the less.

The cheese ravioli was alright, nothing to dream about and the red sauce was red.
The Italian sausage was over cooked , hard on the outside and dry on the inside, the ball of meat was, well, you know, a meat ball. After an Italian dinner I want to burp garlic and taste the food for a few hours after, the only experience my buds are having now is dryness.

Bread and butter were brought to us right when we were seated bur the butter in those little packets was liquefied, and I was melting too because it was very warm inside.

So, not to rain on anyone\"s parade that loves this place, I have to disagree, and as the waitress would say, I'm not Sh--ting you."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Everything is great and the portions are huge. We drive all the way from Glendale to chandler for their food. The pizza is great if you are a Chicago style lover. Their sauces are all homemade recipes by the owners. Some may not think the presentation is great but that is not what I care about. I am about the taste and portion size of my meal. You can tell everything is just like if you were in your Italian grandmas kitchen. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite Chicago Italian restaurants!!! The pizza and sausage is amazeballs and the stuffed artichoke is a must! Have you tried their mozzarella sticks? Why they are so thick and juicy you will cream your pants. The food here is very good and these guys are straight outta Chicago. We grew up going here in the Oak Park location. Definitely worth a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I came to Salerno's a year ago, so if it's changed, I will not know. I came to Salerno's with my family and I ordered pasta, mostly due to not being hungry enough for pizza. The pasta was watery and had almost no taste to it, the only taste being an unslightly amount of oregano that almost made me nauseous. Trust me when I say that I love pasta, I eat far too much that could be considered healthy.

However, this was outright disgusting to eat. My family only had complaints, all of their food watery and distasteful. 

The one thing to boot, there was SOAP in my drink, which made me incredibly sick. Nothing like almost having to go to the doctor because I drank SOAP."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on a recent Friday night. This isn't an upscale restaurant by any means but it's roomy (tables aren't too close together), quiet, and very affordable. The food was good, not great. But what I really liked about Salerno's was the service -- it was excellent in every respect. We left with the feeling that the staff genuinely appreciated our business. So if you're looking for a nice place to eat with good food and a friendly staff, check Salerno's out. My wife and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Always very good food and service  our go to Italian restaurant in Mesa.   Awesome pizza and pasta dishes.  A must try !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have lived in Chicago for 42 years until I moved to Gold Canyon, Az. 13 years ago. Salerno's pizza in Berwyn, Ill. sucked then and it sucks in Mesa, Az. We just got back from there a half an hour ago with 4 nother people from Chicago. I ordered the ravioli and it was cold and sent it back, never to return. One couple ordered a thin crust pizza and it was thick. The other couple ordered a medium crust pizza and the thickness of the dough was like texas toast. People around the country think thick crust pizza is Chicago Styule, very, very wrong. Chicago style is very thin crust. New York style is thick. This place is very overpriced too. Maybe Mr. Salerno and his wife can fool all the Mormons in Mesa with his garbage food but not me. If you want some great thin crust Chicago pizza, go to Scuttlebutts. It is located in Apache Junction on Apache Trail about a 1/4 mile east of Ironwood Dr. on the north side of the street. The blue and white building does not look like much on the outside but inside it is wonderfully decorated and the pizza and other entrees are great. Once again stay away from Salerno's."}
{"text":"One of the hidden treasure's in the East Valley, The food is great (especially the pizza), prices are reasonable, staff is courteous, responsive and fun. All good.

Give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"Three months I ate at Salerno's and gave it five stars and I am going to give them another five star for catering my wedding!  Vince maintained constant contact with me and answered any questions I had.  Arrived as promised, set up and everyone and I mean EVERYONE loved their food.  We had the chicken parmigiana, pink pasta, sausage and meatball bites and bread with butter.  Just amazing and I am getting hungry just reading this.  He helped to make my wedding a success and if you are looking for catering with great tasting food Salerno's is the place to call!
Jim D."}
{"text":"Had the eggplant parmigiana for lunch. Looked good, but it was sliced so thin and then fried all I could taste was the oil. Disappointing. Also, a bit pricey for what you got."}
{"text":"This place was a HUGE disappointment.  We were recommended by a friend to go, and i would never recommend this to anyone.  There was four of us who went and three out of four of us hated our meal.  There was no flavor and very bland.  The prices were crazy and we walked out pissed that we paid $40 for what was awful food.  DO NOT EAT HERE YOU WILL BE VERY DISAPPOINTED.  COULD OF HAD BETTER FOOD FOR $5 AT HOME."}
{"text":"Food was good. I had the meat ravioli with homemade pasta and the pink sauce. You must try the pink sauce. Very good!  My husband had the spaghetti with meatballs  and was pleased as well. A little disappointed they don't have fresh grated Parmesan. Not a fan of the lighting. Felt like I was in an interrogation room. The spot lights are too harsh."}
{"text":"My family and I went here for the first time and ordered a pizza. The service was mediocre and the pizza was awful. The crust was so hard we could barely bite into it and there was so much cheese and barely any sauce. Don't get me wrong I like a lot of cheese but it was way too much. We will definitely not come back."}
{"text":"Called to order carryout. Ordered medium regular with half pepperoni & tiramisu. I also ordered one can of Old Style Beer! They say 30 mins and $26 + some change. I was told to remind them for the beer upon arrival.

Get there a little before and realize there is a side entrance for carryout only. Head over and they ask me for my name. The food was done and they bring it up. I remind them for the beer. I was then told that their liquor license does not allow them to sell it to me! Wow! They asked me if I wanted to drink there.

So I leave kinda in a jumble. Once driving home I realize that I just got ripped off as a medium pizza and tiramisu should not cost near $27. I call and they offer me a $4 credit towards next order. I paid with cash and they stated you only get a receipt if you ask for it when paying cash.

Then I said hopefully the pizza will make up for it. Well it wasn't bad but it wasn't excellent either. Would I get it again? NO.

BUT WAIT!!! There is still the tiramisu that can make up for it! Boy was it a let down! Bottom lady fingers were extra soggy to the point that there was standing water in a corner of the container. It was not frozen like Rosati's, but it was definitely lacking coffee flavor and it was a disappointment.

Therefore, if you are used to Casanova Brothers pizza, then this is excellent pizza, but if you already have a place you like to get pizza from, don't venture out on a limb with this place."}
{"text":"Always great food! I love this place! Fast, friendly service and the food quality is amazing. I had the Nicolina Special OMG the best ever!"}
{"text":"There were some good things but none of them were the food. 

The decor was spartan but I don't have a problem with that. To me it's all about the food.  It was just some tables and chairs with green table clothes and paper napkins. 

The hostess/waitress seated us promptly and took our drink orders right away. She also brought out some bread and butter that was decent but not great.

The pizza on the other tables looked very good and it looked like people were enjoying it. 

I am from Chicago so when a place says they are from Chicago I usually give them the benefit of the doubt.  To me that usually means the place has good food. Not as good as it would be in Chicago but better than most Phoenix Italian fare. 

I will give you a baseline to compare to since just being from Chicago doesn't mean you know good food. 

I like the original Uno's or Due as well as Lou Malnati's. I also like Gullivers if you are from the north side. For thin crust Home Run Inn, Barnaby's and The Spot are all good. 

In Phoenix I like Rosati's, Oreganos and Johnny's although if they were in Chicago I wouldn't go to any of them unless very other place I mentioned was closed.

So I saw this place on Check Please AZ and the reviews sounded great and the food looked great. The pizza looked good as well. Even though it isn't what I consider traditional pan pizza it did look good and not all pizza places in Chicago make the Ike Sewell pan type pizza. JBs on Clark long since gone had a good non traditional pan pizza.   That's what I was hoping this was. 

So there were four of us and we all ordered something different. 

My son ordered the Submarine. It had ham, salami and lettuce on the same Italian role they served cut up for bread. Ok but you could make far better at home or get far better almost anywhere else.

I got the soup to start. It was a Chicken Tortellini. It was ok. Not better than if you bought the fresh Tortellini in the dairy case and added some chicken broth and diced chicken but ok.

My wife and sister got the salads to start. They had a choice of iceberg, romaine or field greens. That was a nice choice as my wife likes weeds and my sister likes romaine. My wife got the blue cheese dressing and my sister got the Italian. My wife commented that the dressings were in little plastic take out cups and how tacky that is. My wife did not like the blue cheese. My sister thought the Italian was OK. Don't get blue cheese at an Italian restaurant. Don and Charlie's or Carson's probably has the best blue cheese dressing I have ever had. That's my comparison for it. A pretty high standard for sure.   

I ordered the Chicken Vesuvio. This is something that is special to Chicago. I used to work at the Italian Kitchen in Evanston and the sister restaurant 3 Doors Down used to make a Vesuvio.  I used to eat it once a week. Google it and look at the pictures. If you are the owner of Salerno's then do the same.

The Vesuvio came out and my wife asked why I even tried it. She said if it was on her plate she would have sent it right back. I thought although it didn't look like it should it might have tasted like it should.  

It was a boneless chicken breast that looked liked it was boiled in the sauce, which looked more like chicken soup than a soup and wine reduction. 

It had mushrooms and onions that were boiled more than sautéed as well. The potato wedges were slightly browned but the so called sauce turned them to mush.

The chicken was sliced into bite sized pieces. The first nite was the part of the breast that is all cartilage and gristle. Not good.  The rest of the chicken was like chicken soup meat. I would not ever order this dish here. That is if you go here after reading this. Google Chicken Vesuvio from Harry
Caray's. That's what it should look like. 

My wife got eggplant Parmesan. Since I didn't try it he comment was it was mediocre. 

My sister ordered Chicken Francaise. Google that as well. The chicken she got looked more like a Chicken Schnitzel. They put the sauce on the side. The sauce was really bad. No lemon at all.  She also got a side of over cooked pasta. The red sauce was very good though. 


I also ordered a pizza. After all, that is what they consider their specialty. I got a baby pan pepperoni and mushroom.  It looked really good. Sadly it wasn't. I actually had to add salt. The crust really had potential but it needed to be a bit crisper. It also needed a bit more sauce that had a bit more spice. It was better than. Papa Johns or Domino's. Maybe the thin crust would have been better.

So my wife asks both me and my sister why we don't send our dishes back. We have no problem sending anything back from good restaurants and they always make it right. Here what we had was a difference in what we considered good food. Some people like Arby's. Some people like Chipotle. I do like Chipotle by the way.

We paid our $100 bucks and were very disappointed. For not much more we could have gone to Don and Charlie's"}
{"text":"If I am on the East side of town I make it a must to stop here. Best Italian food in Arizona hands down! Pizza is out of this world. Love the family touch as well."}
{"text":"I was told that this place was pretty cool, so I was here with a group of people, meeting new friends while getting reacquainted with friends I haven't seen for a long time. 

And so, the feasting and conversation began. It was the eve of the 2016 Lost Dutchman marathon and half marathon on Saturday 13 February 2016 and majority of the group was here in Gilbert, AZ to partake in awesome Italian fare / carb up for the big race the next day. For the prices presented to me, I always have felt that getting a decent sized pizza was the best value for my money vs high priced pasta dishes. I did ultimately get a pizza, which was pretty delicious and definitely hit the spot for sure. It was a small size, versus the baby size. Had about 1/2 of it before boxing it up for future meals during my stay in Phoenix. Salerno's pizza and Italian restaurant is certainly one of the better places to dine here in Gilbert, AZ. The overall experience was decently good and average. I don't think there was air conditioning.

Salerno's pizza and Italian restaurant is located at 202 E Guadalupe Road in Gilbert, AZ. It's located on a strip mall along this quiet stretch of Guadalupe Road and has its own private parking options directly in front of the restaurant as well as adjacent to it, supporting other retail merchants in the strip mall. I arrived here around 5:15pm after shopping at the nearby Walgreens. Reservations were at 5:30pm and it was nice to see everyone. The prices here were consistent with other comparable Italian restaurants, as far as price points go; and the ambiance was very good. Salerno's accepts major credit cards, so that's always a good thing. The service was pretty good and the server was funny and told some jokes, since we told her that we were carbing up for the marathon or half marathon the next morning. It was pretty funny the things she said. I guess you just had to be there for it. Yeah, sounded like she was a non runner for sure.

Yup, so I ultimately ordered a small pizza with eggplant, garlic, and of course, bacon. I ended up paying about $18 for the entire pie, but the main pizza was about $13 with $1.50/topping The melted cheese smothered on everything melted in my mouth and it was legitimately awesome. Granted that those topping ingredients aren't ideal for the common person, but I enjoy garlic on everything and eggplant is great. Plus bacon is awesome regardless. The gooey goodness of the cheer on anything is always a good combination. Gave me a smile on my face during my time in Phoenix, especially before running a race the next day. 

I'd like to recommend this place to anyone and everyone who loves pizza, pasta, and just a good place for good food in the Gilbert area of Phoenix, AZ. Fresh, hot, and delicious at your fingertips!

4 stars solid!

{"text":"Wow!  I ordered a thin crust large pepperoni pizza for pick up and I have to say that it was so bad that I couldn't believe that they even sold the pie to me.  I ordered it and was informed that it would be about 25-35 minutes until it was ready for pick up.  I arrived to pick the pie up in approximately 20 minutes after ordering and it took another 5 minutes for me to get home (around the corner) and dig into it.  OMG!  Cold, of course; yet, despite that issue, it was thick, gooey and chewy, too!  The worst pizza that I have ever tasted in life to date.  Seriously, I am not overstating this fact.  I know that there are all types of pizza types that people demand but I could not believe that this chewy, gooey, cold, tough crusted pie actually was sold to me and for 20 bucks too!  Im completely done.  Order and eat at your own risk.  In this case, you really do not have to ask me not to order from you again.  I was so disgusted that I ate one piece and the rest made its way to the outdoor trash, immediately, too!"}
{"text":"Ordered from Door Dash. Arrived hot and order was correct. A little upset about this \"thin\" crust which is more like hand tossed.. Wings are baked :( was hoping for regular chicken wings they are super soggy and I asked for extra crispy which ..... not so much. Good flavor!! Overall ok! Hate to compare but I might like Buddyz in Gilbert better"}
{"text":"This is real Chicago pizza!! Salernos has the best pizza in Arizona. The original Salernos is located just outside of Chicago. This pizza is the yummiest, and you wont have to ask for extra cheese because it comes loaded with cheesiness. If you want a really good pizza then stop by Salernos."}
{"text":"Appetizer of parmesan crusted chicken tenders was great - 4 sizeable tenders and ranch dipping sauce.  Excellent - half a meal by itself.  Wife had special bow tie pasta with bacon & Italian sausage.  She felt the bacon could have been crispier.  Only reason for not giving a 5 was her less than awesome feeling.  Mine however was the combo Italian Sausage & Italian Beef - FANTASTIC - not just in taste but SIZE DOES MATTER!!  Largest Italian Sausage I have ever seen and supposedly make their own on sight.  EXCELLENT.  Served with two dipping sauces.  Huge portions of both the sandwich and the bow tie pasta.  Service was really great with constant checks.  Was a mix-up with pasta order but was quickly addressed and corrected.  Have had pizza in the past here and it was always good but first time ever tried REAL FOOD AND WAS VERY SATISFIED.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent garlic bread. Had angel hair pasta with meat sauce and it was very good. Their pizza is amazing."}
{"text":"Best Pizza Ever!!  Drinks great, servers awesome!

Garlic bread with marinara sauce.. TO DIE FOR!!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is good, not too greasy and the cheese is delicious. One thick crust pizza was good for all 6 of us. We had toasted ravioli and mozzarella stick as appetizers. We have been there a few times and food is consistent, which I like."}
{"text":"If you're from the East Coast and you've eaten here then you know that this food stems from authentic eats you can find at your local Italian joint. It's a good fix for us when we want some chicken parm (my favorite) without all the mess in the kitchen because I usually make it myself. I love their food and the red sauce is perfect because it's not over seasoned and lets the tomatoes sing. We've never eaten inside because we live so close so we always get takeout.

My only reason for giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is the sometimes the pasta tastes like tap water. It's something that we have noticed since we moved here and pasta's one of those things that you have to be careful with because it takes on the flavor of whatever it's cooked in. I would think a non-mineralized water would work so much better and improve the quality of the food greatly. 

Definitely looking forward to the pizza! The staff has always been nice to us on the phone and it's more simple than ordering pizza with less of a wait. We usually only have to wait about 20 minutes to get our food and it's ALWAYS hot!"}
{"text":"Pizza is ok, but I found the regular crust to be a bit too thick. There wasn't anything exceptional about the pizza, so next time I'm in town I would try someplace else."}
{"text":"My family and I visited the pizzeria this past weekend and over all the experience was OKAY. The marinara sauce was really good the fried zucchini was good and no greasy, mozzarella sticks were good aswell.
My father in law really liked the gnocchi and the pizza was ok.
WINGS - couldn't believe that they had plain, hot and 1 or 2 others but - no mild or medium I had to add lots of butter to there hot sauce to tame the heat for my daughter.
They must be proud of there pastas because there price are on the higher side and the decor is on the lower. 
But this is just our experience, if you haven't tried this place for for yourself then you really ought to see for your self it could be your new fav."}
{"text":"I gave it four stars for its tie back to my home in Chicago.

However, if I did not have that emotional tie in, it would have only gotten three stars.

Why?  
 
I felt the counter service was a bit lacking for my takeout order.  Slow, tideous, disappearing counter guy was to blame.

Secondly, the calamari was subpar for my tastes - a big disappointment.

The Pizza is the reason to go here.  I had a rugular crust (note this is thick crust, not pan pizza) with sausage, pepperoni, onion and green pepper.  This pizza was spot on what I was looking for.  The sausage was delicious, sauce abundant, cheese overflowing and crips veggies.  Excellent pizza - great memories of the previous 40 years of eating the same Pizza in Berwyn and Oak Park, IL.

I will give them another shot.  I will try to dine in next time.

I have to say - their restaurant side of the house was well used on a Sunday night at 6PM.  Doing some good business there.

Second side note - you can buy italian bulk and susage links from the the takeout counter, among other items."}
{"text":"Oh, darling. Let me tell you about this place. To be honest I may never have gone in (it's a bit off my path and next to a gas station) had it not been for my husband and his family. Sicilian, they want to honor everything Italian and as accountants, they've also done work for the family who owns this restaurant. When they brought it up the first time, I rolled with it. Honestly, I'm not one to turn down carbs and hot cheese, so off we went. 

Delicious is an understatement. Everything I've ever had has been amazing. At this point, I ask them to bring me whatever they would want to eat and every time it gets better. We've even done large dinner parties (rehearsal dinners of 40+ people) and everything was fresh, hot, and wonderful. Most of the time though, it's our cute little date spot. We order a bottle of wine and enjoy ourselves there. 

I think one of my favorite parts is that it's family owned and they all work there. Who doesn't love seeing a family work together?! 

Weekend nights, there's going to be a wait. I promise it's worth it, but if you'd rather you can also call in your order to go and pick it up in the back where you don't have to wait in a crowd. 

And if you're starving, get a calzone. They're the size of a dinosaur egg and will feed you for a week."}
{"text":"Been there a few times over the years. I like it. It's an indulgence, being on the cheesy and doughy side. I do wish they had a better selection of beer and wines."}
{"text":"If you like good food and don't get caught up on fancy décor or expensive linens... you will love Salernos!  I've been going to Salerno's for years, but stopped going when I moved to Scottsdale because of the drive.   Boy have I been missing out! I went back this weekend and was in pizza heaven.  There is something about their cheese that just makes a pizza... oh wait, maybe because it's fresh!  I've tried their Gnocci and eggplant parmesan, which were great, but I go there for the pizza and sauce.   I could drink the sauce it's so good, which is why I always take a pint to go!"}
{"text":"I tried this place couple days back, it's by far the best pizza I've ever had!! Great staff & atmosphere. Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a great pizza joint!!"}
{"text":"Salerno's is my absolute favorite place to eat in the valley. The staff is always welcoming and the food is great. Try a calzone if you haven't already, it's my favorite item on the menu. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Cheese is from Wisconsin they tell me. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"I've ordered pizza for take out and have never been disappointed.  Today I stopped in for lunch and ordered the Meatball Sandwich.  Meatballs the size of baseballs, delicious sauce and melted cheese.  My party ordered the Cheese Pizza and Lasagna.  Warm bread and butter to hold you over while you wait for your meal.  Out comes the dinner salad (3 options to choose from) with your dressing of choice on the side.  Family run and operated.  Comfortable and Casual.  Friendly staff."}
{"text":"The food was decent, but it is definitely overpriced. The soup that came out before the entree was cold. Our server was very friendly and provided great service. The atmosphere was fine."}
{"text":"This is definately just a pizza joint and we came for Italian food, disappointing on that front.  The prices are high for the quality and flavor.  There is no Italian restuarant ambience, the butter come in packaged plastic squares.  
If you are looking for pizza only maybe give it a try"}
{"text":"Always looking for local good food. I've been trying to find a good Chicago style pizza place. Someone recommended Salernos. I read the reviews and decided to give it a try.

I had no problem with the decor or the strange carts. The owner came out and was very friendly. Our waiter was okay, not the best service. The calamari was okay. The pizza was not good.

The crust was weird, it honestly reminded me of my mom's homemade pizzas using Chef Boyardee just add water crust. Lots of cheese, but not good quality cheese, more like Kraft cheese. 

When I think Chicago style, I think of a huge pie, thick good cheese at the bottom, then toppings, and then sauce on top (backwards). And this was just a normal pizza (Not Chicago Style). 

It was crowded, so they have fans. I guess it's just an acquired taste. To each his own!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out. Food was overpriced and not very good. My salad looked like deli meat thrown on lettuce. Pizza was not hot. Highly another restaurant over this one."}
{"text":"Growing up on Salerno's Pizza this is one of my  regular stops. The Pizza is fantastic and it is also good as leftovers the next day. The dining room is no frills, so if you want a fancy dining experience, this won't be the place for you. I've tried practically everything on the menu over the years and I can't ever recall anything bad. They also have a really good lunch special.
Five Stars!"}
{"text":"Best pizza around.
This is the real deal from Berwyn.
The sauce is good, so it doesn't hurt to ask for extra.
Good Italian beef sandwiches."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood Italian food! Pizza is great for dine in or carry out. The large cheese raviolis are great and my wife raves about the salads! 

Salerno's has dark windows and sometimes looks like it might be closed, but be sure to go on in... You'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"We love this neighborhood pizza joint. As far as I know this is the only location in the Phoenix area. Original location is in the Chicago area. We prefer the thin crust pizza. Garlic bread, baked ziti and their wings are also delicious. You are also able to buy all the ingredients to make your own pizza at home. We sometimes just by the dough and make homemade pizza at home with the kids."}
{"text":"I have had the pleasure to eat at this restaurant. While not all pizza is the same they do make an amazing Calzone and Alfredo Pasta which I had sirachi sauce added. The kids and family are always greeted at the door by the host and or owner which is a nice change from the bid scale eateries. This is a great small business and would recommend everyone to try. Remember if you don't get the same level of service that we have had, please speak up and talk with the management or owner. They deserve the opportunity make your experience enjoyable. Owe and the cheese steak Calzone with sauce on the side is number 1 for this guy."}
{"text":"This review is for sandwiches only. Pizza gets 4 stars, but sandwiches were awful. Have been getting pizza from there since they opened. Finally tried the Italian beef combo and eggplant Parmesan. Both were awful. Beef was tough and chewy. Eggplant was undercooked, no breading just fried, and flavorless. Hardly any cheese on the sandwich. Just terrible. We are Chicagoans, and know our beef!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Italian restaurants!
The food and the people are the best!  
I love the Salerno clan!"}
{"text":"Best sauce EVER!  Meatballs off the charts!!  I drive from N Scottsdale to purchase both every few months & get double so I can freeze to have later.  Worth every penny & drive time.  Authentic Italian - owners on site.  Moved from Chicago where they had multiple restaurants.  How do I know this?  I talk to both the Mr & Mrs while waiting for my order.   They have a customer for life!!"}
{"text":"Great food, delicious pizza and very friendly service.  The best italian food in the East Valley and one of the best in the entire Phoenix metro area."}
{"text":"The pizza was very good and the staff was nice but the service was very slow. Interior is not fancy but didn't bother us. Liked that we could use a Groupon."}
{"text":"The pizza was good, but don't order extra cheese. My two pizzas must have weighed 10 lbs! Way way way to much cheese. The thin crust cheese and sausage was over an inch thick. Not worth the drive for carry out personally. I'll stick with Rosatis."}
{"text":"It's actually the closest restaurant to our house. When we first moved to Gilbert, five years ago we gave it a try, twice, and were unimpressed. We decided to give it another try last night and after waiting for our food an hour we took it to go. The servers were all really nice, but the \"pizza oven was backed up\". We ordered the thin crust so how long could it take??? Next time, Grimaldi's."}
{"text":"This is no frills traditional Italian food and they do it right.  The pizza is the best around...I'd recommend getting it with Italian beef."}
{"text":"This place does not seem to care about the quality of the food coming out of their kitchen.  Ordered a pan of lasagna for a party. The pasta was super firm, very chewy. It's like they were in a hurry so they put the lasagna together and then didn't bother to bake it off. Ordered pizza another time arriving when they opened. They must have just made the crust because it had absolutely no rise to it and was so tough, hard and chewy I was only able to eat one piece. I took the rest home thinking my husband would be able to eat it (he'll eat almost anything), but he found it inedible also. Threw the entire pizza in the trash. Two strikes you're out."}
{"text":"Always great service and the red sauce (gravy, as we call it back east) is sweet and delicious.  A great place to take a large group or family."}
{"text":"I would rate it a zero if I could. Minestrone was cold. Pizza looked like a frozen shell. Flavor was just ok. Wouldn't order again. Veal was over cooked, looked like a Chinese dish. A bad one at that. They saw me for the first and last time."}
{"text":"Chicago style deep dish is great.  REAL deep dish.  Like you need two hands to pick up a piece it is so heavy.  It screams Chicago. Expect to wait a while for that monster to cook as well.  makes great leftovers.  Never have tried anything else."}
{"text":"Really plain with not a lot of flavor. The decor matches the food, gray, nothing special at all. We left feeling ripped off, $50.00 for pizza and wings worse than Little Ceasars!  The waitress was nice perhaps the only decent part of the visit. I never give negative reviews but this place needs improvement soooo badly.  The crust was way too dense and not even close to Chicago deep dish style. Bland sauce, bland cheese, pepperoni undercooked?
The chicken wings were so tiny, bones were microscopic like they were from super tiny chickens, honey bbq sauce had a tomato like flavor? The mozzarella sticks looked like eggrolls and the marinara sauce resembled chef boyardi. The lighting above each table were literally like jail interrogation lights 200 watt bulbs or something, they gave my wife and I severe anxiety, and made the dining area seem hot and stuffy.  If you love Pizza and Wings don't go here."}
{"text":"This place has amazing Italian food and delicious pizza. We tried it a few years ago because we had a coupon and have been going back regularily since. The staff is always friendly and the restaurant is clean.  I recommend the baked masticiolli with sausage and pink sauce, the thin crust pizza with sausage and the ceasar salad is yummy. They serve fresh hot bread with butter and I love it."}
{"text":"The pizza was the best I've had since being in Arizona. My waitress was very sweet. The side salad I had was only romaine lettuce and some croutons. I won't bother with that next time. The cannoli is homemade and delicious. The bread they bring to your table. Very good. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"They are remodeling to the trendy modern gray look...we did enjoy the Chicago neighborhood family restaurant ambiance...i thoroughly enjoyed the manicotti with a side of 2 meatballs...the marinara sauce is spot on...it's enough for a whole meal the next day...now that's Italian!!! My husband ordered sausage and mushroom pizza which is very good....
definitely authentic Chicago sausage and cheese as we know it but we feel the crust could be thinner so it's crispier....as always would I go back...YES!!"}
{"text":"Salerno 's catered my daughter's wedding 10/7/17. Staff were prompt, courteous, efficient, and conscientious.  They worked in my kitchen like it was their own. I was very impressed with their service. The food was just like you would enjoy if you were  seated at their restaurant.  Didn't recognize my kitchen after they left! I would definitely use them again for an affair."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, excellent eggplant parmesan, excellent cheese stuffed manicotti with marinara, and the linguine with clams and marinara is to die for.  We've been going to this neighborhood favorite for years and I've yet to stray from these outstanding meals.  I could enjoy the linguine and clams every day.  The food is great, not a big selection of beers but that's OK....we can walk home."}
{"text":"Average. Ordered what they said was a Chicago style all meat pizza, but what got was just a pizza with a slightly thicker crust. Also, the toppings had no flavor. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Mary is AWESOME! Great portions and wonderful food. The Mrs. fell in love with the Chicago style pizza and the calzones can feed an army!"}
{"text":"Not the best pizza.  Went there with my parents one afternoon.  My mom is a cheese freak and even she thought it had too much cheese.  I had to chew it 5,000 times to keep from gagging when swallowing. Sorry if too graphic. I just ate the end pieces instead and the whole thing needed more sauce. Their homemade sausage on the pizza was pretty awesome though and the vegetables were very fresh.  I did like that you could make it anyway you want, even the thickness of the crust. The staff was super friendly and the prices were reasonable. The atmosphere was terrible, but the atmosphere only seems to matter when the food does not impress.  
I'll give it another shot, but I'll try a sandwich or something instead."}
{"text":"I was thinking I was going to a order-at-the-counter style pizza place, so almost walked out since I was alone, and don't typically dine alone in table service restaurants. But, I'm glad I didn't. Had the chicken parm sandwich lunch special which came with a salad for $8.xx. Pretty darn good deal. Lunch also came with a small loaf of warm bread and butter. My server was polite and attentive and dropped off the check in case I was on a lunch break. The food was delicious! I'm looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"The sauce is amazing! You can't find a better valued calzone. I highly recommend this place! We've been a few times now and it's consistently delicious!"}
{"text":"Very good Italian food. This is the real thing, and yes this is from Chicago where people know good food. We do have other AZ style Italian food restaurants around where we live, but I will drive 30 minutes to get the real deal. They go the extra mile, no short cuts here. From there sauce, cheese and home made pasta to one of the best pizzas around. And if you ever did have a problem let them know they stand behind there product. My family and I have been enjoying Salerno's for over 25 years"}
{"text":"Very cute little place. We were there for Jill and Jesse's rehearsal dinner and they made sure that if you left hungry, that was your fault. From the bread, to the salad to the yummy panini's to the mostaccioli it was all good. Everyone raved about the desserts but I was not a fan (sorry guys but me no like the nutella brownies tiramisu or cannoli's) I could have had an entire basket of the warm baked bread and some olive oil and I would have been a happy camper. The only thing that stopped me from hogging it all was the fact that I had a bridesmaid's dress to fit into the next day. Otherwise I would have done some serious damage.

If I am ever out in the Mesa area and craving some Italian, I will definitely stop by again. Good food and great staff!!!"}
{"text":"Yesterday, I was able to try their catering at a wedding I attended. The food was not bad at all. There was a chicken parmesan, Alfredo, and ziti with red sauce. All were nicely prepared and very good. I'm interested in trying them in the restraint to see the comparison. Staff was very friendly as well."}
{"text":"I LOVE the lasagna here.  It's huge and never dried out.  They put lots of the amazing red sauce on it.  I love that red sauce!  They also have amazing Italian sausage.  Best in the Valley.  If you get the pizza, ask for THIN crust.  Not a fan of the regular crust.....it's too thick for me.  I enjoy eating here for lunch."}
{"text":"Everything I have had here was excellent! The service was helpful and friendly and my glass was never empty. It looks so unassuming from the curb, if you didn't know better you'd think it was just another come and go strip mall restaurant but this is probably the best Italian I've had in east valley!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to us by several people so the wife and I where very exited to give this place a try. Salerno's also caters and we have had some of their dishes at several events around town and liked everything we've had.

Unfortunately the restaurant experience was very disappointing, so much so that I don't see myself trying this place again.  The restaurant has no atmosphere and the weighers use these carts to push serve, makes you feel like your stuck in an airplane!

I had the Lasagna and it wasn't bad. I have never had any good Lasagna since I moved to the states from Germany so on that note, it was one of the better Lasagnas I have had state side. BUT, the Lasagna was about $15 and way to big. I only ate about a quarter of it. My recommendation to the owner, cut the size in half, add some fresh seasonings and charge $10.

I really wanted to like the food, people keep telling me that they make their own pasta, bread and other ingredients but the overall experience was just to disappointing."}
{"text":"My favorite place for Pizza hands down. The sausage is homemade. I would come here at least once  a week if we lived closer. We ordered minestrone soup to start with my husbands favorite side of their mama's recipe meatballs. All the ingredients are fresh. Since we don't get here that often we order an large to take home. Check out how much left overs we have! Jim's favorite beer too. Negra modelo... you can hardly find it anywhere."}
{"text":"Good but a little pricy. I would definitely recommend! The pizzas have plenty of cheese, just like gooey heaven. I had the Salerno's special salad, the vinaigrette dressing was good but the greens and meats looked as if it something anyone could put together. All in all everything was good enough for another visit. The service wasn't to shabby either."}
{"text":"Do not waste your time or money! I don't normally write reviews but this place was so bad. My husband and I placed a take out order from here. We ordered the eggplant Parmesan, the lasagna and two side salads. My husband picked it up and when he got home no lasagna. So he had to go back. My eggplant was inedible, so hard I couldn't cut it, and the house salad was sliced meats on top of  iceberg lettuce. Not what I was looking for. My husband said the lasagna was decent after waiting a half hour to get it."}
{"text":"The garlic cheesy bread was really good. The pizza sauce was watery and lacked flavor. The vegetables were fresh and the pizza was really cheesy. Very overpriced!Nice staff. Probably would not come back a second time."}
{"text":"The best Italian food I have had ...tadte just like my family cooking every one has passed away and I never got the recipes .great great food"}
{"text":"We ordered for delivery tonight. We are Chicago transplants and have not been able to find decent sausage pizza. Not sure what that shaved stuff is from most places... We decided to try this. We were pleasantly surprised!!! It was the first time in the 4 years we have been here that we have had NORMAL pizza! It was hot and flavorful! Oh and bonus plates and cutlery and napkins arrived. Thanks. Took off one star because the delivery charge said 3.99 but was actually 6.99. Also, whoever cut the pizza had issues. The lines were not straight and were irregularly placed."}
{"text":"Love everything about it. Being a Sicilian man its hard to admit these Northerners know how to do it. So I'll say they're south-ish. Great food every time! thank you"}
{"text":"Been here many times the pizza is very good also ordered fried mushrooms the marinara is so good  you could eat it by it self the beef sandwich and gravy are also a tasty treat ."}
{"text":"This place rocks!  Always amazing service and fantastic Italian food.  Don't let the negative reviews fool you.  Try it!"}
{"text":"This was our first time at Salerno's which is located within a small strip mall. The interior was rather plain and cold looking - not much spent on ambiance. But it was really clean which is more important to us than anything when dining out. 

The waiter was pleasant, but he messed up our drink order and tried to charge us for the mistake until we mentioned it. Additionally, they did not offer happy hour drink discounts which you can find most other places at 3pm. He also brought out a small cannoli when we ordered/were charged for a large. When we brought this to his attention he said another small cannoli would be included with our \"to go\" order (?). This made no sense to us, but he ended up taking it off the bill entirely so we didn't complain. 

We ordered both a thick and a thin pizza which came out in about 45 minutes (it was not at all busy). Both were cooked to perfection and tasty. The crust was just right, the sauce delicious and the toppings fresh. 

My only complaint is that they don't serve what we consider to be true Chicago-style deep dish pizza - the kind that's baked in a deep pan and has the sauce on top. We should probably have known this from all the Yelp photos, but I guess we were still hoping they had it based on how the pizza was described on their menu. In any case, the pizza was great and the price average. 

There were a number of alternatives to pizza on their menu, but the prices for most entrees seemed pretty high. Especially considering the atmosphere. I'd have to KNOW for certain something was going to be really fantastic (and a large portion) before I would spend nearly $20 a plate. 

Overall, this is one of many good places to get what we consider 'regular pizza' if we happen to be in the neighborhood. But for true deep dish, there's nothing like Buddyz or Lou Malnati's."}
{"text":"Before we came here I had heard a lot of great things, especially about the pizza. So I walked in with an open mind. 

Decor- this place definitely needs a makeover. I think they are going for the mom and pop look but it comes across cheap or ghetto. Using the bathroom you have to go through a maze past the back of house and it's cold and creepy. 

Service- our waitress offered us drinks right away which was great but she seemed so rushed I wasn't sure if she was listening. Then, when we were ready to order it took forever. She had disappeared. When she finally returned my husband asked about a couple menu options(again we had never been here before and wanted her advise on what would be a good choice) she just said it's good but can't go into detail because she's too busy. Like WTF. I get your busy but   That's not cool. Not a good first impression. We ordered the kids and my husband ordered his and before I could speak she grabbed the menus out of our hands and started walking away. I had to almost raise my voice to get her to stay to listen to my order. Apparently she thought we were just sharing everything. A while later the food came out and she decided to sing to my kids because my youngest was getting fussy for waiting so long.  This really
Bothered me. You have time to sing to my kids with your tone deaf self but you don't have time to talk about menu options??!! 

Food- VERY bland. The sauce is tasteless, and boarder line slimy. My kids wouldn't eat their pizza and I had only one slice. For the price it was such a disappointment. I think if they changed their sauce the pizza could be really good but I don't think that's going to happen because they sell it by the bottle. 

Don't waist your time and if you really want to try it then order out and don't deal with the staff and creepy location. 

Where is Gordon Ramsay when you need him?"}
{"text":"SALERNOS is my Italian Restaurant! We celebrated for Mother's Day ! We had pizza , Lasagna, Stuffed Shells , delicious Lemon Chicken, Gnocchi & Chicken Salerno!  Ross goes above and beyond to make his customers happy!! If you like authentic Italian go to SALERNOS ... his address is 3921 E Guadalupe RD , Gilbert Az ! Phone number is 480-892-0040. Closed on Mondays but open the rest of the week !  You will love the food ! I give Salerno's a 5 star ."}
{"text":"Great authentic Chicago pizza.  Our waitress Trish was awesome. Best service I have had in a very long time.  I would go back not just for the food but the outstanding service."}
{"text":"The pizza is not the best, especially if you are use to NY style.If you like real Italian food this is one of the best in the valley,a little place in the middle of Gilbert.Try the cavatelli  with white or red sauce, they are homemade,as well as the gnocchi, if you try these or the zucchini parm I guarantee you will be back."}
{"text":"Salernos catered my wedding this past weekend and it was the best restaurant I could have chose! The food was amazing and everyone was raving how delicious it was! The staff was all great and took care of us from the tasting up until the night of the wedding. I have absolutely no complaints and will recommend them to anyone!"}
{"text":"Since we are from Chicago and used to go to this pizza place in Berwyn, IL we could not wait to get there for the pizza.  We went there and ordered an XL pizza and when we got it, the dough was soggy and it was overbearing with cheese.  We were both way too tired to complain but will never go back.  Service was great, but pizza a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Italian beef sandwich is awesome, Chgo deep dish pizza is authentic. Stay away from Chicken Marsala...it does not resemble or taste anything like I've had at numerous Italian restaurants and the pasta side was forgotten until halfway through the meal.  We asked if this really was Chicken Marsala......and the answer was 'that was what you ordered didn't you?'  Had to explain what we were used to getting when that dish is ordered and was told, 'that's how we make it.' Definitely would not order that again and considering how 'they make' certain dishes, I am inclined to only get Italian Beef (especially at lunch time, better $$) sandwich or pizza.  Definitely pricey for the decor and overall Italian food quality."}
{"text":"Having been to the original in Berwyn and also to the Villa Park location way back when I was excited to see that they were going in by my house in AZ.  This place brings back memories of \"Back home\"....the pizza is still the best.  The italian beef was a little too thick and lacked the flavor of Johnnies or Mr. Beef but then again it's a pizza shop.  A++ pizza that reminds me of home....thanx Salernos!!!"}
{"text":"My Fiance had grown bored with the eggplant parm at Macaroni grill, so we decided to find somewhere new.

She loves it here, says it is the best she has had, and the portion size is huge.

I always order a pizza, they are great here, by far the best out of anywhere I have been. The \"baby\" size is more like a small everywhere else, and the thin crust, and regular crust is great.

The owner is always there, and more than happy to wander about and talk, and the staff is always uber friendly and on top of things.

I HIGHLY recommend this place for great food, and service!"}
{"text":"Cannot believe the 5 star reviews of this pizza. I just paid $30 for a thin crust pizza and have to say the worst I have ever had. I'm from Chicago and this pizza is not. It's a good looking pizza, but when you bite into it, it is horrible. The crust was so tough we couldn't even eat it. There was no flavor either. What little sauce they put on was tasteless. The cheese for some reason had no flavor either.  Bottom line a no flavor cardboard crust pizza. We only ate a few pieces and threw out the rest. A waste of $30. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"I must say I'm surprised with some of these reviews. I've been coming off and on since they opened. Ross does a great job and is almost always there. Most of the time I order the pizza, but I've also had dinner several times in the restaurant including a great Valentine's dinner a few years back. They are in my rotation of places to go. 
   The restaurant is clean and service is good. Yes, the atmosphere is a little on the dull side. Kinda like a pizza pub trying to cross over to finer dining. My guess is if they could get a better interior you'd see more people coming in for supper, but that's why I don't own these places only eat at them. 

  Ross has great food and fresh pasta every time I stop by.

  Pizza = Thick and cheesy like I love it. Crust is chewy and tasty. And I love the italian sausage they use. 

  Chicken Parm= Out of this world. Love the sauce and they use a nice plump chicken breast.
  
   Ravioli = Fantastic, fresh made and one of our favorites.

  Try it and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Salerno's did NOT disappoint for our rehearsal dinner! The food was plentiful (seriously, what E said...if you left hungry..that was your fault!!) and everyone was pleased with the quality. My favorites - The paninis and the warm bread. Hi everyone. My name is Jill and I'm a carb junkie. The staff was very friendly and helpful. While the restaurant closes at I believe 9pm, they accommodated out dinner which started at 8:30pm. I called Tracy a week or so prior to let her know that we were unfortunately down 2 people and she said that while wouldn't be able to get a refund, we'd be getting a gift certificate for the amount. THAT WORKS FOR ME! 

We look forward to using that gift certificate too!  :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian food ever!!! The pizza is amazing & I love the giant calzones!! It's family owned & operated. They are from Chicago & so friendly & happy to chat. 

Oh, and we love going over there & buying their pizza dough it's so cheap! And we can make our own pizzas at home! They have a side door for takeouts. 

Do yourself a favor & try this place!! You won't be sorry!!!!"}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed dining here. Based on my experience this sat Saturday, I may never come back. After a casual night, we wanted to have a great meal. Upon arrival we were told that there will be a 15 minute wait. During the wait of 25 -30 minutes, other groups came and were seating before us. When asked why, the host said that the others were reservations. I believe that we were not seated for \"other reasons\"."}
{"text":"This is a decent pizza place that has a good sized facility for lots of capacity. The style of pizza is Chicago but the crust, while thicker, isn't overly greasy so it doesn't sit like sludge in your stomach.

The crust actually is the surprising thing about this place. I had pieces from two pizzas- sausage and pepperoni. Both were very good. Both had tons of cheese. And again, the crust is thicker than normal but not grease-heavy. 

Pizzas do take a while to cook, but it was worth it. I personally prefer New York style pizza, but this might be one of my favorite Chicago styled pizza places.

Prices seemed reasonable."}
{"text":"This is my family's go to restaurant for Chicago pizza. Great pizza and pastas- everything always tastes fresh and like classic comfort food. I take everyone from out of town here!"}
{"text":"We went with takeout, getting a Chicago-style pizza (pepperoni and sausage) and a Linguine with Clam Sauce (white sauce). The staff was friendly on the phone and when I came to pick up my food they were quick to retrieve it and the process was painless. For the price, you'd think the dining room would be nicer, but it looked more like a cheap sports bar.

The pizza was as most on here have described -- the toppings are tasty (but don't stay on the pizza), but the crust was gummy and chewy to the point where I just couldn't eat any more. I'd go with Lou Malnati's or Rosati's 100 times out of 100 over this pizza.

The pasta was unlike anything I've ever encountered in my life. You expect a garlic smell and certainly when dealing with seafood there's always the possibility of stink. My wife (who loves and regularly cooks with garlic) got through a few bites before deciding she would also have to give up. We had spilled a little bit of sauce on the counter and threw away the rest of the pasta. Less than 30 minutes later we realized the mistake we had made, as our house stunk in the worst way. Not only did we have to take the trash out immediately, we had to disinfect the counter and throw away the towel. It was that bad.

In the end, it was an expensive meal that we ate little of and because of the price, there's no way we'd give them another chance."}
{"text":"The red sauce is delicious and my husband and son love the pizza( too much cheese for me). We order take out here on a regular basis and I have also picked up quarts of the red sauce to put in my own pasta dishes. We are normally very happy with the chicken pasta salad but the last time we ordered it, the pasta itself had a horrible frozen and reheated gelatinous mess texture to it. I could not eat it and just picked the chicken and veggies out. Stick to anything with the red sauce or the pizza and you'll be happy."}
{"text":"Our favorite Italian spot hands down.  Great Italian dishes made from scratch.  Pastas, pizzas, sandwiches, all super delicious.  I have tried several different items and have not been disappointed.  A must go to restaurant, but bring an appetite, portions are hardy!"}
{"text":"Ross the owner is amazing! Such a great guy and he has the best pasta in town. I ordered the Fettucine Alfredo with Chicken. Such huge portions and SO good! Hands down my favorite place in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Never again will I eat here. 
Went for dinner here on a Friday night and the place was packed! Based on the reviews I thought it was going to be a nice date night.. Oh boy was I wrong. 
After being seated it took longer then expected to get drinks & menus, which was fine since they were so busy. 
We chose pizza & lasagna for dinner. Judging on the price of the lasagna $15.00 + $5.00 for sausage, we thought it was going to be excellent! When it came to our table, we both looked at each other speechless. It was a plate covered in basic marinara sauce. Looked as if it came out of a can. There was no cheese on top, nor was there much filling between the layers of noodles. He took a couple bites and was done. Could not even try to push it down. 

Moving on to drinks & environment. We each received 1 cup of water that was never refilled. Need I say more? 
And for the grand finale.. They didn't have their AC on! I'm a person who always takes a jacket places since I get cold easily, but not here. It was so hot! We were sweating just sitting there. The poor waitress was sweating so badly and doing what she could not to drip sweat in the food. 
The whole establishment needs a Redo. They look like they are pinching penny's in all the wrong places. 
I don't understand how they have so many good reviews and the place was packed? It's mind blowing."}
{"text":"The food here is beyond terrible and overpriced.  I honestly don't see how people are actually giving this place decent ratings.  The staff brings EVERTHING and that included the to go boxes out on a bus cart.  The salad (if you can even call it that) had no green in it whatsoever.  It consisted of only the inside pieces of iceburg lettuce mixed with what I think might be trying to pass as ham.  All though my dinner companion theorized that it may be catagorized as spam or bologna.  The pizza was covered in burnt cheeze and the crust was undercooked.  It was so tough you couldn't bite into it, instead it had to be cut with a steak knife.  Their Italian beef sandwich was cold and the meat was completely dry.  The fact that we were there at what should be peak dining hours on a Saturday evening and the place was totally empty should speak for itself on the popularity of this place.  I honestly can't say that I've ever had worse Italian food ever in my life.  

If you want good Chicago style pizza drive a few more minutes east to Old Chicago Pizza.  At least there you won't have to worry about an upset stomach the next day."}
{"text":"Salarnos neighborhood pizza and wings is one of the best in town! Worth the drive to try this Chicago style pizza . Both the thin crust and reg are great lots of cheese and sauce is so tasty! Wings are breaded and super crispy,\" we get sauce on the side\" it's always consistent. Lil hard to get extra ranch but it's a small price to pay for great food!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in the east valley.  The crust & handmade Italian sausage are the reason this pizza stands out.  And this is the only marinara that never gives me heartburn.  It would get 5 stars if the ambiance was a little nicer (could break up the room with some booths and carpet to dampen the sound, but it's still nice).  The staff were spectacular--and we had 4 kids under 10 with us!  Been many times and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"The pizza was good, the service was good, the decor a little plain.  I enjoyed the pizza, it was a thick, tasty, pizza.  The sauce was sweet, the cheese was heaped on, and the crust was perfectly cooked.   I would go again."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to spend a rainy Friday night in instead of going out for dinner. I'm not sure why we hadn't tried Salerno's sooner, it's right by our house. 

We each got an XL pizza so we'd have leftovers for the whole weekend. That was an understatement! The pizzas are HUGE!  I got a simple extra cheese (with ricotta cheese added as well) and hubby got pepperoni and mushroom. The crust is thick Chicago style and while I usually perfer N.Y. style (where I'm from), this was amazing! The thick crust with ricotta added tasted almost like a pizza calzone. 

We definitely will be back. I'd love to dine in and try some of pasta."}
{"text":"I love pasta. This place is the best. Rather I get it to go or dine in, my food is fresh and the way I like it. They remember me and my order. Desserts are good to."}
{"text":"We had a party of 15 people at Salerno's last night. We made reservations ahead of time. Nina was our serve and she was fantastic! We ordered a variety of pizzas for the table to share. The food was hot and delicious! Half the pizzas were thin crust and the other half were original crust. All of them tasted great. We've had large parties here before and returned because we knew Salerno's would do a great job. Thanks to all the staff who made our family get-together a relaxed and happy event. We will be back."}
{"text":"Pizza is thick, chewy in the center, crunchy on the outside and tasteless"}
{"text":"Found this place from watching check please, it was very delicious! Great family atmosphere, great pizza! You won't be disappointed, portions are generous!"}
{"text":"I ordered a thin crust sausage, CB, and green pepper (which they forgot to put on but that's alright) medium pizza, and it's a bit of a disappointment.  Sauce is good, ingredients are good but the 'thin crust' was not thin and it just wasn't good at all.  The crust is where the pizza lost it for me.  It was thicker like a hand-tossed style, it was extremely chewy, and it didn't proof correctly--could still taste the yeast.  If it weren't for the crust, the pizza would be decent.  I wouldn't go back, but for the people who live that far east, it's an okay place for pizza.  And for all the  AZ Chicagoans out there, if you are looking for that thin crust checkerboard cut style pie that we're used to----you will not enjoy this joint."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great pizza. The people are so friendly. Family owned I would drive across town to eat there."}
{"text":"My wedding was on 10/7/17 and I had you guys cater it. The food was amazing and I have received great reviews about you also from all my guests. The staff showed up on time and were friendly and attentive throughout. The pricing for it all was very reasonable. The kitchen required no clean up after or any of the tables. I was very impressed. Thank you again"}
{"text":"Meh. I really wanted to like this place. I've never been so disappointed. SMH. Definitely DON'T come here if you're looking for ambiance. I felt like I was in the waiting room for prison visitation. The lights hang right on your head and I was getting anxiety from the heat and the feeling of being interrogated. My hubby has an anxiety disorder and felt he was in duress the whole time. Pizza was a phenomenal disappointment,  bland, doughy, ZERO flavor. I asked for half cheese for my toddler and got a firm \"we don't do that!\" The tea tasted stale, (you know that wet socks taste) and growing up in AZ, I know good tea. The wings are like little fried chicken with sauce on them, heavily breaded, NOT good. Tomatoey flavor for honey bbq? Ugh. The mozzarella sticks where battered, like a fish batter though, thin, flaky, crunchy, served with a thin, watery marinara, not good!! NOT EVEN CLOSE! Living in San Diego I had some life changing pizza so I know what awesome pizza tastes like, my last trip to NY we had some STELLAR pizza. I don't know what Chicago style pizza supposed to taste like but Im pretty sure Chicago would be disappointed. Barros kicks this places ass if you can believe it. I'll go there or Twisted Pies next time. What a waste of $50. #feelingpissed #2starsforcleanliness #beyondsad

P.S And what's with the plastic food cart to serve and box up food? That's the most awkward, nursing home, cafeteria feeling I've ever felt!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the east valley,no hype just good old fashion chgo pan pizza,memories of 16th st in berwyn. Thanks Salernos."}
{"text":"Once again, had a great Italian dinner at Salernos. Love this place."}
{"text":"This was sort of a disappointment. We had high hopes for the old style restaurant, but the majority of our dishes ended up being flavorless or just sub par. Soup, salad, pasta (we didn't try the pizza). No ricotta or fresh cream/cheese, just regular mozzarella that didn't seem high quality. The canoli was sad. 

The prices were too high for what they offered. To be fair, the manager came to check on us and we did mention everything was ok, because nothing was particularly wrong, just sub par overall. Can't understand the crowds."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant on numerous occasions and will never go back after I found a dead fly in my salad and flies inside the restaurant.
The restrooms are dirty and no soap in the men's room.
The pizza isn't anything like the restaurant in Chicago or the pasta sauce .
The pizza is always over cooked and the owner doesn't accept criticism very well.

I found a true Chicago restaurant in Queen Creek Arizona called Baci Italian Bistro which has authentic Italian food and the best thin crust pizza I've ever had. The 

We revisited this place before Christmas and the place was empty and the service was absolutely horrible.!! We ordered pizza again this time it came out burned. The cheese was black and of course we sent it back.!!  That will be the last visit to SALERNOS.!!  It's very obvious when they are selling Groupon's for $8.00  for $15.00  value during the snow bird time your business is doing poorly.!!  We will stick with Giordano's and Lou Maloti's both now here in the valley .!!"}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this place yet? A friend told us about this place and we are hooked. You must try their cheese sticks. They are not like any other moz cheese sticks you'll find everywhere else. 
We usually get \"babies\" individual pizzas. I'm not even a big pizza person but I love their pizza. Crisp on the bottom. 
They have a pasta special every once and while bow ties with Alfredo sauce with shrimp and chicken. Omg. Best Alfredo I've had! Not oily and super cheesy. I eat the whole thing every time. Lol. 
Service is great. People are friendly. Great place."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. It tastes like they put beer in their dough which I don't like but they do it right and it's okay! I know others say there's too much cheese but I love cheese, in fact I can always use more :) We also got fried cheese sticks and they're coating is different than others. It was unique and really good. We will go back!"}
{"text":"The salad, pizza, meatballs, and pasta were fabulous. 
Atmosphere and service was excellent."}
{"text":"So I've driven by this place a million times and have never stopped to eat here. It had been recommended to me by multiple people so I finally decided to try it. 

The Good: The pizza!!! I like Chicago style pizza and have had very good Chicago pizza, and I have had very bad Chicago pizza. This place ranks in the very good side! I can't say it sticks out but was just as good as I had hoped it would be. No complaints from me on the pizza. I also shared one of their canolis and it was also amazing. Loved it!!! 

The Bad: The dining room. It is probably the ugliest restaurant I've ever been in. THE WORST!! This place has no atmosphere!! everything is painted dark brown. The tables and chairs look like they were left over from the family reunion 15 years ago. The servers don't carry anything, they push around plastic busing carts, even for drinks. Very weird and not at all inviting. Also, I had iced tea, it tasted like water. No flavor at all. 

Overall - I gave it 4 stars because I will totally eat here again, the food was great. I'll just get it carry out!!!!"}
{"text":"K and I stopped by while C did his rehearsal thing down the street. First of all, the lighting sucks. Really. These little halogen spots above the tables just don't work in a restaurant setting. I will say it is the brightest dining room I've been in but that's not such a good thing.
Our server was really nice. She was attentive without bothering us. On to the food.
Why do so many people rave about this type of Pizza? Now K is from Chicago. She's eaten at Salerno's before in Oak Park and Berwyn. Even she understands the frustration when the toppings, including the cheese, slides off the crust. What is that? She says it's Chicago style pizza. Well, thank goodness I'm from So Cal and we don't have a \"type\" of pizza. I like good ingredients, which this place has, in a good package, well . . . I guess I'm just not a fan of the cheese OVER the toppings, or should I say fillings? Regardless, to be fair, the crust, the sauce, the cheese and the toppings we had all tasted good. It's just the entire package that disappoints me. Since the toppings slide off and the whole piece isn't integrated, it doesn't work.
We also ordered a large house salad which was sad for the price. I mean for over $9, you need to have more than lettuce, some shredded carrots and croutons. Maybe for $5 it would be worth it.
Strange restaurant lighting, expensive house salad, slippery pizza. 3 Stars."}
{"text":"I had the lasagna. It had a hard layer of mystery meat on it. I've never had lasagna like that in my life. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Just moved back to the Valley and used a welcome coupon for take out. 
Paid $10 for a large antipasto salad that was truly one piece of sliced up cheese and a few pieces of meat and a couple of pepper on a crisp, healthy portion of salad. Apparently I paid for great lettuce. The pizza was a gloppy mess of cheese with a very small amount of sauce and dry crust. The sausage(what little there was) was fabulous. Don't order what I ordered unless you like it that way. I won't go back. Oh and the cheesy garlic bread was too hard to eat."}
{"text":"Love this place! Awesome pizza, insane calzones! Owners and staff are top notch!!!!!"}
{"text":"I always use Doordash to get Salerno's delivered. Always super hot, and yummy food. Have only had one mix up on delivery (missing my husbands meal), but that was more of door dashes fault. The pizza is delicious, and the baked pasta's are amazing! Highly recommend. 

The only thing I do not like about the business, is if you eat there, the lighting is terrible!"}
{"text":"Couples night brought us here for dinner. We had a couple of Wisconsin folks that wanted Chicago style deep dish pizza. Well, we learned they have what they call thick style not the deep dish so we all decided to go another route. Our waiter was very friendly and accommodating to this group of first timers and took the time to explain various dishes and make suggestions. I had the chicken parmesan w/mostaccioli & red sauce. The chx was a massive cut which covered half the plate. My girl just had the mostaccioli w/red sauce. That was a large plate of not over cooked pasta. Italian dishes are all about the sauce so, if you like a more acidic less sweet style you may enjoy it. Another in our party had one of the specials which was a baked spaghetti with pizza sausage and the pink sauce. Now that, is a mix of alfredo and the red and was well received.
The last dish had was the Lasagna and it was a large serving. We all had leftovers. I will say this, the pricing was a quite high as each couple paid $50 with tax & tip. I just have a hard time spending that kind of money for pasta."}
{"text":"I grew up down the street from the original Salerno's on 16th Street in Berwyn, Illinois.  It was a Friday night tradition to get a pizza from Salerno's.  One that I missed terribly when I moved to California -- and found, much to my horror, that the \"best pizza\" rated locally was Papa John's.  Ick.

Recently, I discovered that the Salerno family spread wide and a new Salerno's was in the Phoenix area.   My folks live in Tucson now so on the way home from visiting, I made the 50 mile out of the way detour to hit up Salerno's in Gilbert.  It was worth the drive.

Salerno's is true to what made us love it in Chicagoland.  The pizza is lavished with toppings and then covered with a gigantic blanket of cheese.  I am told they fly in the ingredients from Chicago, and it shows.  The tastes were all the same, biting into the \"regular\" order we would place, this tasted just like I remembered.  On my last trip through town, I placed a \"to go\" order with a large pizza half-baked to show my friends back in California just what a pizza was like.  The staff was beyond friendly and helpful, making sure that I was set to take the pizza back and with plenty of directions to properly bake it at home.

I only wish they'd open a Salerno's in Southern California!  It truly is a fantastic Chicago pizzeria.  County yourself lucky, Phoenix, to have this here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! Great customer service and pizza to die for!! The owner and son absolute cuties and the daughter such a sweetheart! Definitely my new pizza spot!!!!"}
{"text":"It has been several years since we have been here. The decor and lighting has been updated and looks nice. The food and service was great"}
{"text":"I had heard Salerno's is a good option for Italian food in the east valley, so I decided to give it a try. I went about an hour before closing and was seated very promptly by a very friendly employee. 

I decided I would try the pasta and went with the manicotti. I thought it was a bit expensive compared to several other options (Casanova Brothers and Buono's) in the east valley, but went forward with it anyway. The manicotti came with a salad and bread, and I selected the Italian dressing. 

I received the salad and bread promptly. The salad contained fresh, crisp lettuce, but the dressing was very oily and lacked taste. The bread was decent, but nothing spectacular. Not too long after the salad came, the manicotti arrived. I was surprised to see it on a plate that was dripping sauce off the sides. I cannot recall ever going to an Italian restaurant and receiving a plate that so poorly contained the dish. The red sauce was fairly tasty, but the manicotti was bland in taste and was not hot enough. I wondered if it had been heated up rather than baked. The portion was large at least, so there was food to take home.

Overall, I was not that impressed with my experience at Salerno's. Everything about the place including the service and decor was OK, but not particularly good or memorable except for the sweet employee who greeted me. I think I will stick with my other favorites for Italian food rather than returning here."}
{"text":"Don't go for the atmosphere... Go for the awesome tasting food and great friendly service! We had the chicken amore and a sausage mushroom onion pizza on their regular crust and an order of onion rings ..... OMG... Everything was amazing! Definitely get the onion rings they were memorable!! I'm a New York pizza guy but this Chicago style pizza was amazing. We will be going many times to come!"}
{"text":"The pizza was quite bland, the chicken in the chicken parm was chewy and undesirable. The sauce was next to tomato paste. However, the bread was really good."}
{"text":"Pizza is awesome. Great neighborhood pizza place. Looking for sophisticated, this isn't it. But pizza is awesome.  Family owned. Try it. You won't be disappointed."}

{"text":"Horrible Food; First off we never got bread/butter; Never saw an Italian place that did not give bread. The salad came. My wife had a spring mix, it was good. I had regular salad,it had alot of brown in it. The House Italian dressing was just oil & Balsamic Vinegar. The Brushetta had a nice flavor but it looked more like salsa than fresh. The Meal...Wow!!. My wife had chicken francaise that was crispy & covered in chicken broth, no flavor other than what tasted like campbell's. They also gave her sauce on side that had a long black HAIR. I had Chicken Parm that tasted old & re-heated. The pasta on the side I ordered with alfredo sauce. It was greasy & too watery. The waitress actually said that it is homemade & it will thicken. They did not charge us for my wife's meal. We will never go back. Enter at your own risk."}
