{"text":"I don't usually order chicken menu but I ordered Aloha Chicken there for the menu name was interesting. It was so different and great!  Very friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Hon pocha is by far the best place to have a drink with korean tapas and socialize in a korean atmosphere. One thing we've been always missing in Las Vegas is somewhere to have a drink with korean food and atmosphere and this is THE place to go! The owner is so nice and very welcoming all the time! Food is good, atmosphere is good, service is good! 10/10 recommended"}
{"text":"Great food! The owner was very kind!!! I recommend tteokbokki and aloha chicken!! I recommend this place :) Also, great place for drinking alcohol!"}
{"text":"This place hit the spot. If you are looking for korean gastro pub try this place out. We had soju (korean rice drink) and whole fried chicken and jjangpong soup. Jjangpong was spicy and the chicken was fried perfectly. Light and crispy. Our server Jay is very friendly and made our night pleasant. I will definetly be back!"}
{"text":"??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Came here for the 3rd time for dinner after an event with some friends who hasn't been here before. We actually originally wanted to come here months ago but back then, before they had an alcohol license, they closed fairly early.   So now, they finally got the chance !  As usual, the same waitress had served us. Always great service and attention. ,! haha !   My friend had gotten the Aloha Chicken. Another had gotten the spicy chicken feet. And I, again, had gotten the fried chicken with a sweet and spicy sauce. Except, the difference was, the chicken feet and fried chicken, requested for EXTRA SPICY !   Although their spiciness doesn't match Yasik Nara's ability to go even spicier, but their extra spicy was pretty good. Hot but manageable. All of us were able to eat it, even the not really spicy eaters.   Whats funny is, this version of extra spicy fried chicken with sweet and spicy sauce, reminded my friend of a Chinese pork dish, Peking Pork Chops (????). After she mentioned it, I did taste some resemblance. HAHA how funny.   For the first time, I had gotten a bowl of rice to eat with my dish as well. Soft but chewy Korean rice w/ spicy fried chicken. Yum ! ugh im getting hungry while writing this.....   Friends aloha chicken was pretty yummy. Smaller pieces of dark meat across a plate on a bed of cabbage topped with seaweed. Not spicy as well. Kind of sweet. It was pretty good. I wouldn't mind eating that as a snack XD wonder what kind of seasoning they used.   As per usual, another good meal. XD Coming here more and more often now... uh oh XD"}
{"text":"Fatastic service and food Food is  really delicious We will come back again I love this store  Dont change anything plz"}
{"text":"Visited Vegas from LA and came here after a recommendation from a friend.  Great food, especially for the price. You won't find similar high quality korean food at nearly the same price. We got the ddukboki and donkatsu, with soju and beer. Their sauces are perfectly marinated with good portions. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem!  After a couple hour wait trying to get into clubs. We decide to ditch that scene and find some good food. It was around 1 a.m. when we decided to Uber ourselves to Hon Pocha. It was a Monday night, not much of a crowd there, but that didn't bother us.  Note to self: Always take a picture of the menu. They do not have the most recent menu posted so I will try my best to remember names and prices of everything we tried.   (Best to least fave)  Meat Jun $12 I've never had this before so I'll describe my experience. It's thin slices of beef that is coated in an thin egg based batter and lightly fried. Ahhhh, talk about some tender juicy pieces of meat! There was a light soy dipping sauce on the side for some more flavor.   Aloha Chicken $12 I had a hard time deciding if this was my favorite, but it's a close second! First of all, it's soooo tender it just melts in your mouth. You really taste the sauteed green onions and hints of ginger throughout each bite.   Spicy Cheese Bulgogi $12 Hellooooo, deliciousness. No really, I don't normally eat much of any dairy but I really enjoyed how the mild cheese complimented the very flavorful bulgogi!   Fried Chicken Wings $12 These came out pretty basic, but wait... the korean spicy paste that you dip with it - is addictive. I've tried many korean spicy pastes, but this one was different and more spicy! The cabbage mixture in the middle felt a little out of place - some kind of salad with ketchup?  Chicken Cutlet (Katsu) $15 These came out fresh and hot! I really liked how crispy the batter was against the tender chicken.   La Kalbi $15 - Bulgogi $10 These were your classic dishes you can find at almost any korean influenced restaurant. All were marinated and seasoned very flavorful. No compliants here.   Stir Fry Chicken Gizzards $12 This would be the first time for me to have gizzards stir-fried and I didn't hate it. The pieces were just as tender as all the other dishes we had.   Spicy Seafood Ramen $6 The broth was more like a really light miso broth. It was okay.   Chamisul Grapefruit (Soju) $11 This was soooo tasty - sweet and light! This has to be one of my favorite soju flavor thus far.   There wasn't much I did not like about this place except for the kimchi being our only banchan (side dish). The concept is gastropub so I'm assuming that could be the reason why. Besides the food - let's talk about service. Our waiter was beyond attentive and friendly. She made us feel very at home and said we could stay as long as we would like. Their late night closing time is 4 a.m. and they don't try to push you out like most places would. We found this place on yelp and gave it a try. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for some good grub!"}
{"text":"Hon Pocha!!! This place is the bomb!!! Great atmosphere. Great food.  Loved the whole vibe. Came by dinner and fell in love with the feel for this place. The food is the absolute best. This authentic Korean Bar good spot is a great place to bring a group of friends and hang out. Service was very good and servers were kind, friendly. I really enjoy the atmosphere inside the restaurant and would love to come back. Defenitely 5 star!!! SSa Jang Nim~  I wrote a great review give me 1 soju bottle for service. kkk"}
{"text":"Excellet service!!! Great food options and atmosphere. My dumbass friend ate the cartilage but didnt know you could eat the cartilage. Hahaha idiot"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Korean pub place in Vegas. Their foods are also amazing and service is wonderful. I recommend Aloha chicken. If you are good with spicy food, I recommend Tteokbokki. All the foods are delicious."}
{"text":"'Meat jun' n 'Spicy pork rips' r so great with drinks. Especially 'Spicy pork rips' is really good with soju. U must try it! However i like 'Meat jun' more without drinks. Ive never eaten this kind of 'Jun' ever in my whole life! I love this place :)"}
{"text":"I came here with my lady's co-workers, we had chat n food and beer ... it is a spot if u want to grab some korean fusion n have relaxed time with u firends, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Where do I start? They have dinner plates at $10. So we ordered the Kalbi plate for my husband and I ordered the spicy squid plate. Very large portions with kimchi and two other sides. We also ordered the seafood pancake and the chicken gizzards.... all I have to say is everything was very delicious. It all reminded me of my mother's cooking ( which is very delicious also) customer service was excellent. Our server was so polite and very engaging.  We will definitely be going back!!!"}
{"text":"All the dishes are too delicious compare to other restaurants even though this place is not a restaurant, Korean traditional bar. Do not hesitate to visit this place!! You would regret if you don't try foods here."}
{"text":"I don't recommend this place. We waited way to long for two dishes food. Actually, one came out and the other came out 30 minutes later. The waiter kept on either apologizing or just trying to avoid confrontation with us. On top of all this the food was pretty bland and flavorless. The only thing they had going is the rice. They have good rice. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere for Korean food. There are plenty of better options."}
{"text":"Dukbokki is the best Udon is the best I loved their service!"}
{"text":"New drinking spot for me in vegas. I loveed their spicy pork cartilage with rice balls. New gem in this town!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my boyfriend! One of my friend introduced to me to check out this place. Foods were incredibly delicious, and servers were very nice. Therefore, I could feel the delightful atmosphere in here. Since it opens until 5 am, it is a wonderful place to get delicious food in the late night. Today, I tried chicken feet boneless with rice ball and green onion fried chicken. The food is very nicely presented. This restaurant is best place to experience Korean food and alcohol. I will definitely come back again with my other friends!"}
{"text":"This place is very very good.  My husband is Korean and we eat at a lot of Korean resturants.   Some very expensive, and some not as much.  This place has great service, and the price is amazing.  The Food was very good.  We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This place has incredible, nostalgic Korean food. There's so many items here I don't even know the direct English translations for so I'll just describe them as best I can. Hon Pocha focuses on featuring food that's lesser known such as the aggujjim, dakbal and meatjun.   This is one of the few places that sells aggujjim if you're into that. What the hell is that you say?? It's 'braised spicy angler', according to Google but I'd describe it as spicy monkfish. If you've never had monkfish before the texture is similar to catfish. Be careful because it's commonly served with the bones intact but it's very easy to eat around it and dispose of it properly.  The dakbal is literally chicken feet and it's served in spicy seasoning sauce. I'm not a huge fan of dakbal because the meat is pretty scarce. However it is pretty good considering how flavorful the seasoning is. Not my first choice but not entirely bad either!  The meatjun, which is similar to Korean pancake (pajun), is delicious. It's a safe bet if the other two dishes sound a little too crazy for you. It has a thin layer of batter on the outside and tasty meat in the inside. Can't recall what type of meat but I want to say beef.  They didn't have their liquor license when I went there but the owner did mention they will carry all popular Korean alcohol such as soju, makgoeli (rice-based) and bokbunja (berry-based wine).  The interior is dark and dimmly lit, which is perfect for some late-night drinking and fun. It certainly has that vibe to be a go-to hang out spot for me, once they serve alcohol and finish up the decorating. It felt a little empty in there.  Will definitely return around December for a follow-up meal."}
{"text":"First impression when I walked in was \"this place is empty\". Found out from the owner that they've only been open 10 days. Makes sense to me. Checked out the menu and went with the bulgogi plate and the aloha chicken plate, to go. While I waited, the Owner gave me some Kona coffee-tea. Really good stuff. Service was excellent, and she offered me extra kimchi. Who could turn that down?  Now.. for the food. All I can say is wow! The portions were huge, and full of flavor.  The meal is accompanied with potato salad, kimchi, and another house salad..hence the huge portion. The bulgogi has just the right amount of onions, and it's crazy good. Make sure to try that out. I was sad I didn't finish the Kona stuff before my meal was ready,  so the owner kindly gave me a cup to go.  So...I will be back. Great service, and the food is legit."}
{"text":"The service is very good. Nice music and vibe. The dish is very big and provide a free beverage."}
{"text":"The Meat Jun, Udon, and Aloha Chicken were some of the best menus items there at dinner time so I decided to go out again. This time I went out during their lunch times and ordered a kalbi plate and it was out of this world. The waitress there was also really nice. Next time I've decided to bring the rest of my family along wi"}
{"text":"Overall experience: not impressed at all  We had such high hopes because of all the positive reviews. We came to find out that what more than half of previous review raved about (combination special) has been discontinued - even though those reviews were only 2, 3 weeks old. Nevertheless, we decided to give it a fresh view.  Service: We ordered bulgogi and fried chicken wings.  It took close to 40 minutes for us to get our fried chicken. There was only 1 other party sitting there. Mind you this was about 30 minutes after the bulgogi came out. We got so irritated to the point that we wanted to just cancel the order.  We also didn't receive the warm tea like another reviewer stated.   Food: It was disappointing. Bulgogi meat was HARD. As if I was chewing a rubber band. But rice was good. Fried chicken was worse than the ones you can get from Albertsons. The ones from Q karaoke was 100 times better.   At least the server was OK, and was apologetic that the chicken took long time to come out.  Not sure how they got so many positive reviews, since the food was bad.  We probably won't come back."}
{"text":"I took advantage of their lunch special, ordering the aloha chicken, while my friend opted for bossam. The warm and gracious server welcomed us with cups of complimentary hot barley tea, served up generous portions, and asked if we wanted more sides whenever she saw we were running low. The chicken was very tasty and had texture, with perfect accompaniments of sweet potato/macaroni salad and cole slaw. Bossam was also on point, paired with kimchi on the more fermented/tangy side.  Despite the edgy, dark ambience -- they were going for gastropub -- this place serves up simple, well-made Korean dishes. It's clear that the restaurant has built quite the goodwill, as there seemed to be many repeat customers. Not unexpected, given the quality of the food and warm service. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow my friend from out of town found this spot. Authentic Korean food and service was awesome. Waiter and waitress that night offered us all kinds of stuff and recommended dishes we wanted to try out of the norm. They were very attentive and will definitely come back. They are open til 4am!!!"}
{"text":"Sooo disappointing!!! This is how a lot of businesses trick us yelpers, they reel us in with good deals so people leave raving reviews then 3 months later they \"up\" the prices and food quality goes down hill.  This is my first time trying here and was excited based on pics and review on yelp. Went in and ordered take out so this review is based only on their food.  First, they don't have japchae, 2nd everything is ala carte no special plates or whatever is depicted on here.  Ordered bulgogi $10, and meat Jun $10. See pic i took, no rice comes in the plates, or any sides. They were kind enough to give me a small side of rice? And I had to ask side of kimchee which she kindly said \"ok I won't charge you\" hmmm most korean eateries I know you get kimchee for free, you also get veggies, salad and a soup for free. So not sure why this place does it like this.   Flavor was even more disappointing, both the meat jun and the bulgogi was dry and tasteless, even the dipping sauce for the meat jun tasted like straight soy sauce. No body finished a plate of food. The best thing was the steamed rice, but how can you mess that up?   Man...I really wanted to like this place too..."}
{"text":"I'm from Hawaii so I was looking for a late night meat jun place. This is it!  The meat jun was so moist and made out of rib eye. If anyone is looking for a good Korean restaurant you gotta check this place out. The service was one the best I ever experienced."}
{"text":"Came here later night at 8:30pm on Dec- 28  , the Service Jessica was very nice and informed us they will close at 9pm to make sure we have enough time to eat . Jessica take care us everything and offer some free Extra rice and more .... ! I promise to gave her 5 stars review on yelp after i come back to LA . And the Food was very Tasty too. Will definitely come back again on my next visit. Thank you Jessica!"}
{"text":"A good spot to grab late night Korean snacks or munchies. My friend and I ordered the bossam and the rice cake soup. Both was very delicious! Very satisfying and happy with the food here. The bossam was so good and our server helped teach us how to eat it. It was yummy and the meat was hot and flavorful. The rice cake soup broth was soooo good. They give you a lot of rice cake in it too so they weren't cheap about it. They also threw in a salad for us and it was so good. I liked the balance of the salad. Definitely will come here for Korean munchies."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Good presentation! The server was very welcoming and friendly! I cant wait to come back again! We got the Kalbi and Meat jun and Aloha Chicken! The best thing was their Kimchi! It was on point amazing!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and plenty also the service is good, Korean style omelette and rice bowl is tasty! Having Great service, free soup and beverages!"}
{"text":"Finally tried the new place - korean restaurant. Owner told me they will sell soju( korean alcohol) soon but not yet so i tried only for some meals now. Over all very nice and the owner couple is very kind and professional.  We tried spice pork bone soup, chicken cutlet and stir fried squid- highly recommended and couple others and i will try other menu also in future!  Very clean and kind. Cant wait to go back when they ready for Soju and fully ready every menu with even new !!"}
{"text":"I'm a visitor from SF who had a great craving for Korean food. My standard for Korean food is rather high as I was born and raised in Korea and still travel to Seoul every other month.   Anyways, found this place on Yelp and went for a dinner. The place must have opened recently - very clean and modern. They explained it will soon be \"sojubang\" where Koreans go for drinking with great snack food. The staff were so friendly.  I ordered Gamjatang - and this pork bone stew blew my mind. I didn't expect this tasty food in Las Vegas, let alone in this unassuming gastropub. The pork meat was tender, and the broth was not salty but just right with wild sesame and sesame leaf aroma. Other side dishes were good as well.   Definitely coming back here for the food and for drinks!"}
{"text":"Finally they got liquor license!  Yay :) I'm so happy that I can have their bomb dishes with soju"}
{"text":"Delicious food, Excellent service, Beautiful setting. We're from Orange County. Just found down about this place from Yelp. The restaurant offers unlimited kimchi and they even get us some for to go since we like it so much. We will come back again !"}
{"text":"Fantastic meal here at 11:38 am on Sat/6 Jan 2018: - Friendly server brought me a cup of hot tea and offered ice water. - I had the Special BBQ Plate #10 Hon Pocha Combo, $14 and includes can of soda. - Pleasantly surprised by how much meat/food was included and how tender and tasty the meats were.  I (attempt to) do Paleo but the potato salad was too good to forego and I wanted to eat more of their delish white rice (only had a couple spoonfuls, thankfully the meats were plenty filling).  - The Smith's Supermarket plaza Hon Pocha is located in has seen lots of mom & pop Asian eateries come and go since 2010 when I first started going there.  I hope Hon Pocha builds the clientele and receives the recognition it deserves.  For sure they'll have my eager repeat business when I'm in the neighborhood.  /////////////////////////  My 10 favorite overall value eats (great food + great price). - As of 7 Jan 2018.  No particular order.  Bonus brownie points to places close to my homes. a) KoMex - Korean-Mexican b) Big Wong - Chinese c) Village Pub (Henderson/Gibson location) - Bar Food d) Manna Mediterranean (Henderson) e) Estiatorio Milos (Strip) - Mediterranean, $25ish three-course lunch f) Hon Pocha - Korean g) Jackson's Bar & Grill h) HK Seafood Garden - Hong Kong style(?) i) Jjanga - AYCE sushi k) Flock & Fowl or anything by Chef Sheridan's family (eg Great Bao, RIP)  Honorable Mentions: Three-way tie between Henderson's Kitchen Table, Served and CRAFTKitchen.  I'd put them in my top 10 but I'm usually not in to brunch (too early to get out of bed)."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Korean pub in town. Most of the food is around $10!! Server is very friendly. The food that the chef cooks is as good as the hotel chef,  Especially for me who likes spicy food.  I am very happy to have this restaurant in our town. Hon pocha that you can always feel free to meet friends!"}
{"text":"Jin the server provided me with professional service. Water and other amenities were provided promptly and Jin gave me good suggestions. The Meat Jun and aloha chicken were bomb. The udon is a bit spicy. They do provide Korean spices upon dead like doenjang and kimchee. Many of the patrons were Korean speaking Koreans so the place had an implications of approval by the local Korean community.   Overall bomb food for late night munchies."}
{"text":"i came here with my sister and it was such a welcoming and warm experience!! our server jessie worked to try and accommodate my food restrictions (gave me a special house salad) and gave us free kimchi and rice. she was so sweet and kind!"}
{"text":"Food was great and portions were big, service was terrible i wouldn't go back. The server was texting on his phone the whole time and sitting around. Also when he took my order he didn't write anything down and i ordered 4 items and a bottle of rice wine for the table and i already knew he was going to forget because he didn't write anything down. Sure enough i watched him punch in the order then he sits down and starts texting on his phone and 10 mins go by and no drinks until i flagged him down to remind him."}
{"text":"This is the place to be, if you need some Korean Soju and tapa style food. Everything is hand made from all the dishes to even their signature coffee water!! Hidden Jewel of Vegas and must try place! (Open till really late too like 4am in the morning)"}
{"text":"Sweet spot with amazing food and drinks! Great service and good ambiance. Recommend for late night drinks and munchies!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, very sweet and attentive staff, and good pricing! I got the pork neck bone soup and it was awesome, my friends and I got a bunch of stuff to share and it was all tasty."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Same lady served my friend and I both times and has always been very nice. So sweet!  Spicy chicken feet - yums. We actually got this both times (came with same friend both time). I like it especially compared to the crappy dim sum ones. $14 My sister prefers the mushy chicken feet but I prefer the texture more firm.   Enjoyed the fried chicken lunch combo we got last time. Came for dinner the second time.   Fried chicken with sweet and spicy sauce $15 this was surprisingly very good! I love this. I will probably get this every time now. It's boneless chicken.   Spicy pork cartilage $12 this was harder than expected so expect lots of hard chewing if you get it.   I hope to come back soon to try other stuff. Definitely want to try the fried chicken gizzard and possibly the meat jun in a future visit. :0)"}
{"text":"I wish there were more places for Koreans to go in Vegas. So I much appreciate this spot, it make me feel at home. It's a nice cozy drinking place for your soju night out with friends. Definitely recommend this place!"}
