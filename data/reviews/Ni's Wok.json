{"text":"Decent Chinese food. Not the greatest, but decent. A little pricey, but nice and local. Delivery is nice, always in a timely manner, but only accepts cash."}
{"text":"Great food!! Outstanding quality! They are super  fast and I've gotten food here three time and they never seem to disappoint. I recently moved here and it's a very short walk from my apartment. The only reason I didn't give them five is because they aren't that great at customer service."}
{"text":"Their Hunan dishes are delicious and their fried rice is the best BUT 2 things to ABSOLUTELY AVOID is their Hot and Spicy Shrimp. It is neither. Just a bunch of stuff in a very sweet orange sauce and their Won Ton Soup. These are very hard lumps of pork filled pockets. You cannot cut them."}
