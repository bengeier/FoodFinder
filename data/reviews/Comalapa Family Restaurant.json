{"text":"This place is great!! I had pupusas and tamales and the taste was delicious !! Really nice staff, really cozy ambiance. The staff was awesome and  the owner very friendly and enthusiastic. It seems that they love what they're doing and it shows.  The whole place just has a good vibe--I think it is all emanating from the The owner and his food. I definitely will be back at Comalapa Family Restaurant."}
{"text":"Carnitas were flavorful but salty.  Chicken quesadilla was salty, the chicken was oily and undrained.  The same chicken was in the burrito, and again, too salty.  The waitress was very nice, but the food we had was just too salty & oily. Meh."}
{"text":"Can't judge a place from the outside. Comalapa is a friendly little place. And the food is good. Yuca and chicharon... great!!! This place is missing the wow factor which I think is the lack of recipes. The 1st time I went here the pupusas were spot on. Then today I ordered the same pupusa and they were not the same."}
{"text":"This has to be one of the best family restaurants I have ever been to, and I have eaten all over the world.The place is so clean you could eat off the floor, the food is magnificent to say the least.Me and my family eat at this restaurant every time we come to North Carolina and that is about 4 times a year.The owner treats you like family and the staff treats each customer as if they were a movie star visiting their restaurant. Belive me this restaurant is the best that you will ever encounter .Do yourself a favor and visit this place .you will keep on coming back."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst Salvadoran restaurant I ever been, the food is not that great, is over price,  definitely I will not recommend it to anyone!"}
{"text":"So glad I stumbled upon this restaurant! The super-friendly owner greeted me immediately and walked me through the menu, explaining how they serve more than just Mexican food.   I ordered guacamole to start and it was great! The owner explained how they make each order fresh, and you can really tell!  For my meal, I had the Mole Enchiladas. Mole sauce was great, but I was more impressed with the chicken.   I will definitely be back with some friends to try some tamales and Pupusas!"}
{"text":"Outstanding customer service and food, I don't go here often but I should definitely start. The quality of their food screams authenticity. I recommend compalas to anyone and the great thing is, they're open in the morning so you can have breakfast. Then turn around come back and have lunch. The staff will hold good conversations with you like your best friends. I get the Chimichanga with Rice and Beans! Try them for yourself"}
{"text":"South Boulevard is lined with plenty of family-owned Latin American restaurants, after getting my car serviced I decided to stop in one for the first time. I was there between 4 and 5, understandably not peak hours, but I was one of three customers in the place and I only encountered one employee during my entire visit. The feeling was very strange, she only turned on music in the restaurant after I sat down and it felt like my friend's mother was making me dinner while her own son was away. She was very kind and suggested some Hondurean entree called pinchos, I ordered them with chicken. While waiting on my entree, the server brought me chips and salsa, standard for a restaurant of this type, however the salsa was very bad, tasted more like tomato soup. The entree arrived, I'd describe their pinchos as meat with onions and peppers on a stick arriving on a sizzling skillet. Also coming with the meal were rice, beans, plantains, and a salad with sour cream and pico. The rice, beans, and salad were average, nothing to rave or complain about. The chicken was very, very good. In hindsight would definitely have ordered a more traditional chicken dish. The two plantains were unusually large, almost like pancakes, and were hard as rocks. The bill for just myself was $12, which seems to be overpriced given that their customer base would be lower-income transplants. Overall, an average experience, don't believe I'll come here again"}
{"text":"Excellent service, friendly people. Delicious food! I would recommend Comalapa Family Restaurant to anyone. Thank you!"}
{"text":"My birthday is Feb. 14th, and Valentine's Day birthday dinners for the group can be challenging, but we always find a great place. Last night was no exception. I've been wanting to try Comalapa Restaurant near us, and figured it wouldn't be too busy. Well, that was an understatement. I knew it was going to be a great night when we walked in and we were the ONLY customers there! Exceptional, personal service and great conversations with the owner. Not to mention, the food was SO good. Even mom's Grilled Vegetable Plate was outstanding. Barely any scraps left for a doggie bag. Thanks Francesco for a wonderful birthday celebration and feast!"}
{"text":"Yum.    You're going to enjoy the authentic traditional Mexican cuisine here like their tacos, but don't be afraid to try the Honduran or Salvadoran items, too.  I liked the pupusa and chicken tamal.  Spicing the food up with some side orders of guacamole or pico de gallo can be a real taste adventure and can make the difference between an average meal and a terrific one.  This part of South Blvd. isn't really the best part of town, but don't let that scare you off.  They also do carry out."}
{"text":"Best chicken tamale I've ever had! They've got great ceviche too, not very spicy tho... I'm thinking they toned it down for me. I don't speak Spanish so I had slight difficulty ordering, but after having worked in a place like this in CA, that's a good sign! Will definitely be back, often."}
{"text":"Comalapa tries for every south of the border flavor in our hemisphere - they have a huuuuge menu - but for us, nothing stood out. At all. Like eating shadows of the favorites we ordered, things were pretty blah.  Papusas - eh - mild in corn and cheese flavors, a little tough. Got the \"cheese and veggie\" ones, they came with some interesting orange slaw I'd never seen that had an odd black pepper thing happening. Most interesting part of the meal.  Rancheros - skip - chopped peppers, bland tomato sauce.  Rice - something chinese-fried about it. Unexpected and unwelcome.  Salsa, chips - watery, bland and fried waaay earlier, consecutively (to be fair, we hit them 10 minutes after they opened).   Our waitress was sweet, and brought me some hot salsa. Not bad. All garlic. Owner guy greeted us loudly and enthusiastically, but if the food's meh...  I'd estimate 90 percent of the menu is meat, and I hope that's where they excel, because for veggies, this ain't a stop to make."}
