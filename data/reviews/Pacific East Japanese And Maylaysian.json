{"text":"Just like its flagship store located at the conner of Mayfiled"}
{"text":"If you're a fan of good sushi, authentic Japanese, or Malaysian food, this is the place to go! I've been here around 6 times since it's opened and have tried a variety of each type of food and have yet to find something I don't like. If you're in the mood for some great food and service, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Stopped here while traveling for work. The food was incredible, the staff was friendly, and the atmosphere was clean and inviting.  If I'm back in the area again, I'll be returning"}
{"text":"Walking in brought back memories of Malaysia, the aroma of the spices, heavenly! Nice staff and a simple, clean restaurant with ample space between tables as not to feel crowded. The coconut seafood soup was delicious with light and delicate flavors, their curry puffs -superb! The main course was their Randang curry with chicken - Yummo  Super nice food, great flavors taking me half way around the world! Do yourself a flavor favor and eat at this restaurant!!!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and reminds me of my past trips to Malaysia. This restaurant is excellent and very cozy."}
{"text":"Great food! Love love looove the laksa :D Definitely will come back again to enjoy some authentic southeast asian cuisine!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food!! We tried 2 different sushi rolls that were incredible, and for a pretty good price! There are some special sushi rolls that are a little more expensive, but still fairly priced. My friend and I both got the Pad Thai and really enjoyed it! I can eat a lot of food, but I couldn't finish my plate, and had enough for a whole lunch the next day.   My only complaint was that the service was quite slow. The staff was all friendly and helpful, but as long as you're willing to be a bit patient, and you want some really good sushi, I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Clean with friendly staff. Decor is sparse and chairs are narrow and rather hard to sit in. Sushi is very run if the mill here - good enough but not amazing. Other diners looked to be having tasty tempura and other dishes - if I go back I'll def try something from the other side of the menu."}
{"text":"Horrific restaurant. Lazy interior with barely any decorations and ugly vibe. Saw a waiter sneeze is his hand then tend to guests. Waitstaff did not listen and were very awkward and rude. Only took half our order, sushi rolls were TOO big and hard to pick up and eat. Did not taste fresh or good. Same with the chicken teriyaki- it was a bland mess. Overall would not recommend and certainly am never going back"}
{"text":"Good food at a good price. Pad Thai was yummy! Clean. Nice waitress. Lots of options to choose from. Also good chop sticks"}
{"text":"Opted for carry out since I had my toddler with me. Ordered the vegetable dumplings and Hainanese chicken. Parking was dicey since the street was closed for a festival, but the food was great."}
{"text":"Same owner as the one in Cleveland Heights. Very contemporary and new to this area. Defiantly fits the Kent University life style. Try it out if your around."}
{"text":"Amazing food, I had the shiitake soup to start, then Lemon  Chicken fried rice as an entree; which was deliciously different with wonderful flavors.  My husband had the Shrimp Pad Thai, equally good.  We can't wait to visit again and have some of the sushi."}
{"text":"I decided to try again.  This is still just 3 stars.  This time, I had \"fragrant\" fried rice with seafood.  I guess the rice was fragrant.  I'm not sure what that is supposed to mean with regard to rice.  It was fairly bland and sat there in a gooey, starchy lump.  There were a total of 3 shrimp (yes, I counted them, it is not hard to count to 3), apparently to fulfill the menu description.  The were overcooked and rubbery.  Obviously, seafood is going to be frozen in this part of the country.  It is still possible to do better.  There were a few small, white, rubbery pencil erasers that seemed to be passing as scallops.  The rest of the dish was mushy and unidentifiable.  There was no egg to be seen, even though it was mentioned in the menu description.  This place has a really hard time producing dishes that are fully matching the ones they describe.  Overall, this dish wasn't \"bad\", but I would not have it again.  It would have been greatly improved even by a few red pepper flakes or some chili paste.  The server never appeared the whole course of the meal, so it was not possible to get any.  I had also a spicy crab maki roll.  This also gets about 3 stars.  Again, not \"bad\" to eat, but certainly not spicy as described and the crab was *almost* very fresh.  Probably this is my last review of Pacific East.  I don't believe I will visit again."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I had the Malaysian Curry, it was awesome. Reasonably priced for such good food."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Kent! You'd never expect to find such fresh sushi and delicious Japanese food in Kent Ohio, but it seriously amazing. The service is always quick and friendly. I've eaten here many times since they opened and have never had any complaints. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"So far, so good! It's hard to find Asian food in this area that isn't laden with sugar. My son and I stopped in for lunch and were pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere which was subdued, fairly quiet and tastefully decorated. The food was very good; we had miso soup, sashimi, tempura shrimp and veg. It was all very tasty and perfectly cooked. We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"One of the best Asian restaurant in the area. I tend to eat a lot of sashimi and they do not disappoint. Their appetizers are top notch. Try their roti and calamari. The sushi is a bit pricey, but it's worth it in my opinion. Sometimes there's a wait to get seated, but it's not out of hand. My favorite waitress is Anna. She is absolutely the best and I ask for her every time. They have a wide selection of food, so there's is no reason not to find something you like."}
{"text":"First trip so I wasn't familiar with varieties of food. But everything we ordered from sushi to sashimi to noodle was great"}
{"text":"UNBELIEVABLE!  I grew up as a child through high school at Kent, Ohio. Downtown Kent always was a quaint, artsy and stylish location with a plethora of shops and restaurants.  I traveled back to my hometown after 30 years to find this GEM of an Asian fusion, and AUTHENTIC restaurant blessing Main Street!  I was dubious at first, questioning how there could ever be a really good sushi restaurant in Kent, Ohio - Tree City. I was pleasantly proven SO wrong!  I walked into the well decorated, and soothing establishment that exuded contemporary fashion with ceramic natural wood textured flooring, and classical music playing in the background. Even at lunch time, the restaurant was well attended with hungry patrons.  Now onto the food:  I have a Chinese and Thai ethnic background, I love sushi and have had the pleasure of sushi indulging in these raw delicacies across the US.  This restaurant provided all the assortment of sushi I would come to expect from a premiere sushi establishment.  I ordered the sea weed salad (wonderful crispness with a nest of fresh radish embedded), uni (in Kent! Rich melt-in-your-mouth yoke-like flavor), mackerel, salmon roe (fresh and moist), and sea bass (tender) a la carte, along with the tempura jumbo pacific oysters (very well encrusted with flavorful tempura batter; plump oysters!), and Naruto roll (yellow tail, avocado, fish roe, wrapped in cucumber and resting in a delicate pool of Yuzu sauce).   Looking at their menu, there are SO many dishes I wanted to still try, ranging from Malaysian, Thai, Japanese, and Chinese - all hitting in the mark of dishes that inspire Asian taste buds. Looking for noodle dishes (dry or soupy), they deliver.  Looking for specialty drinks, so many boba (YES, in Kent!) options.  Service was excellent, fast, friendly!  Portion sizes were larger than expected, especially the seaweed salad!  I look forward to visiting my home town again, with a newfound excitement   to revisit this special place.  THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"Great food and even better lunch specials!! If it wasn't for the lunch specials, my girlfriends and I would defiantly never meet there as much as we do for lunch. Really wish they accepted FlashCash - it would make many more student go there since many love sushi."}
{"text":"This is the only restaurant in the Akron/Canton area that serves Malaysian food so far. The other closest restaurant that does is in Cleveland Heights named ... Pacific East! They are well known for their fresh and tasty sushi but don't overlook the other dishes."}
{"text":"Really excellent Asian food, a courteous and helpful staff makes for an excellent addition to the Kent food scene. I had the Malaysian style spicy beef which was very good. We'd heard some great things about the sushi so ventured forth for a couple spicy tuna rolls. Was a little disappointed since the fish didn't have much texture & the rolls were prepared pretty loosely, making it fall apart & hard to eat. If they can tighten up that aspect (pun intended) or maybe stick primarily with Malaysian/Indo-Chinese fare, this place has real promise."}
{"text":"Quality AND Quantity  This place is such an upgrade over the tattoo parlor that used to be there. It's was nicely redone, nothing too fancy and over the top, just a basic solid decor. FYI, they don't give you a fork, so you either have to ask for one, or in my case, save some pride, but look like an idiot eating. Or maybe you're a competent human being, and chop sticks are just fine.  Our appetizers were tasty, and very inexpensive. I'd never had veggie dumplings and really enjoyed the taste. The satay tofu had a really good peanut sauce and mixed well with the bean sprouts.  My wife had been here before and thought splitting a dish would be enough food. I'm a big guy, so I wasn't sure whether or not to believe her. Well, she was right. We got the Curry Mee, and they were gracious enough to split the dish in two bowl-   great customer service. Even though it was split, each bowl was a huge portion. I was absolutely stuffed afterwards, and it was, get this- 8.95. It was soooo good. I'd absolutely get it again. The spices had just the right amount of kick, and the chicken was so tender and flavorful. I loved all of the veggies and potato mixed in there. Homerun.   Their menu is humungous. I can't wait to go back. I was staring at all the food going to other tables and it all looked awesome. Especially the sushi. I really enjoyed the large windows, showcasing the vibrancy of downtown Kent as you eat."}
{"text":"I have lived in Malaysia and love their cuisine. Happy to find this new restaurant. I tried roti canai and nasi goreng. Both were very tasty and similar what I had eaten in KL. Next time gonna try nasi lemak!"}
{"text":"I'm moving to Columbus and this restaurant will be one of the few things I'll miss about Kent. I've come here every other week since it's opened and I've never been even remotely close to disappointed. The service has always been absolutely wonderful, and I'm a server as well so I can almost never enjoy going out to eat because of problems with service. It's a clean environment with an extensive menu that will cater to anybody's food preferences. The hamachi (yellowtail) is the best in Kent, hands down. I ALWAYS get the latte bubble tea (when knew bubble tea could have coffee in it?) and chicken coconut soup. I mix up the sushi every time I've come in and it's been lovely and tasty every time.  Bottom line, if you're on the fence about checking this place out, go ahead and give it a shot. It will be worth it.  I'll miss you guys!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, friendly staff, quick service, and fresh taste!!! We have been here twice already in a short time, and have had great experiences. Our first time we dined in and the service was EXCELLENT. We had a rainbow roll to start which was so fresh tasting, and two of the chef specials: Tom Yam Seafood Clay Pot and Yakiniku. The Yakiniku had a great flavor of sweet and spicy... only a little kick. We also ordered  the Honey Yuzu tea with cream cheese. It looked strange with the cream cheese on top, but it was very good! Almost like a cream-cicle. Our second visit was take out and the standard of service was still high! We ordered two noodles dishes: Pad Thai and Mee Goreng-- definitely recommend Mee Goreng!! After moving here from California we weren't sure whether we would find a place with good sushi and a diverse menu, but this place is a new favorite!"}
{"text":"We had laksa, sashimi and sushi roll, totally satisfied with each one! Surely the best Asian food in town!"}
{"text":"I am very VERY happy with my experience at Pacific East!  My husband and I were greeted by a very friendly hostess and quickly seated.  Drink orders were taken and we were given ample time to explore the menu.  I had the shrimp pad Thai and I must say, it is one of the bests I have ever had!  I also had the mango bubble tea and loved it!!  They boxed my meal for me since I got a lot more than I could finish.   The place was clean and for lunch, well lit.  I can't complain!!!!  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"First time here, we loved it! Great prices, HUGE portions. Half of our party was full after appetizers. Great location, wonderful atmosphere. We will be coming back. I'm so happy for more fantastic options in Kent."}
{"text":"The food is delicious! We had the Roti Chanai and the Chow Kueh Teow and both were very tasty. I'm looking forward to going back to try other dishes."}
