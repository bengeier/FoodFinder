{"text":"the restaurant itself is very nice and clean. it's right on the lake, and it has a great patio and bar area. I was in a group of 6 people, and we were seated outside. it was pretty, but I wish they had misters and a big umbrella bc the sun was either right in your eyes or on the back of your neck. our waiter was helpful and nice, and made a point of checking up on us every 15-20 minutes and refilling drinks. however, the food took forever (about 35 minutes) and we were there on a Sunday evening. the food was okay. I had the portobello sandwich which was quite small and it came out cold. my boyfriend had the fish tacos and they were also cold. we would have gone on one of the boat rides that they offer, however the battery was dead by the time we were ready to go, which I figured would have been the redeeming quality of the evening. they gave us about 10 free boat tickets. I would suggest going during happy hour to watch a game and load up on appetizers (which were all very good!) then do a boat ride around the lakes. not sure if I would visit again if we didn't have the boat tickets."}
{"text":"The menu here is stock standard fare.  Perfectly ok but not inspiring. Same old menu template.  I had the rack of ribs which were great. 

Major problem was that our server wanted to go home (at 7:30 pm!!!!!!) so we were rushed the whole way.  Guys-screw that.  When I go to a restaurant I don't give a fig about your staffing schedule.  Don't rush me.  I can cook.  I come out for a relaxing experience.  If I wanted a soup kitchen I'd go to one.  You messed that up.

But to be fair, this was one time.  I'll try you again as it might have been bad luck."}
{"text":"We showed up at open time at 11am. Door was still locked. We waited for the server to open the door smelling of BO and an extremely wrinkled shirt. 
There are two \"brunch\" items offered a breakfast burrito with either bacon or sausage and a breakfast sandwich. 15 minutes after we order said server tells us they are out of sausage. (You just opened and its Sat!) I ordered the breakfast sandwich. Bread was hard as a rock and cheese was not melted. I sent it back and decided to just share with my husband. 
My coffee was cold (mind you they JUST opened and we are the ONLY people in this place. I ordered a new fresh cup. That one was cold too. Disappointing to say the least! Terrible. Never going back! 
Beautiful view, such a shame...this place is going out of business soon I guarantee it."}
{"text":"The place is big and beautiful and the waterfront made even better. I had chicken cujons with fries and it was good.  I really like the mustard sauce.  I wasn't happy with the brownie dessert because they didn't have caramel.  I also was not happy to hear their blender was broken and I couldn't get frozen drinks because it is on the menu.  I will definitely go back because of the atmosphere and I want to try out the boat ride. The waiter provided good service too."}
{"text":"Today was our first day trying out the Watershed and it was wonderful. Our server was Michael and he was absolutely fantastic.  He even put up with our energetic 3 year old. The salmon fish tacos and cod bites were amazing...the sauce that comes with the cod bites was delicious. The drink menu made it hard for me to choose, but I went with the Huckleberry lemonade and Bloody Mary. Both were great but for a hot Phoenix summer afternoon, that lemonade was perfect.  It is super nice to have the Watershed in the neighborhood and we will most definitely be back soon. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Great patio and casual food with a nice bar.  Rotating craft beer selection and drink menu!  One of the best places in the Valley to watch the sunset over the water."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to the watershed tonight.  Everything was good. The food, service and atmosphere. The food was very tasty. The restaurant was kinda cool. The view of the lake was great too. Ignore the bad reviews, it's a good place and seems fun at happy hour."}
{"text":"The view is awesome, the patio is great, food is okay but be careful bringing your husbands and boyfriends here as I was completely appalled at the blatant behavior of their events coordinator hitting on my boyfriend with no shame right in front of me. It was extremely uncomfortable and unprofessional. If I ever go back it with be with my girlfriends."}
{"text":"What a great evening! Delicious well prepared food, a lovely lakeside outdoor setting, friendly welcoming service, and two great musicians playing oldies and their original songs. Special shout out to our server Laura who was conscientious , personable, and went above and beyond to make our visit enjoyable. Also kudos to chef James who not only accommodated my restrictive diet but came out to discuss my options and delivered a meal that met the restrictions but was also delicious: sirloin steak cooked perfectly, garlic spinach and a baked potato (that most chefs don't do any more because it's way off menu). My husband recommends his shrimp Alfredo and the Frozen strawberry daiquiri."}
{"text":"I got a coupon in the letter and that is how I found out about this place. It is very close and looked interesting so I tried it out. It was happy hour so we ordered a couple things off the menu. The waiter came back and forth 2 times to let us know that the menu item we chose were out. They were kind enough to give us a free menu item because of the blunder. I don't mind that part much but the food was not very good. I had fish tacos, which had fried fish balls. It was dry, fishy and tasted like it was frozen. It came on 2 layers of very greasy corn tortillas. The beans and rice on the side were mediocre. The free food, which was back ribs, was not very good either. It tasted gamey and just smothered in sauce. I will say they have the best cole slaw I have ever had. Instead of being super mayo-y, it tasted fresh, unique, almost like vinaigrette, and I loved it. I guess I am giving one star for the cole slaw, and one star for the nice view. Unfortunately, I know I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great place. Fun atmosphere great happy hour nice staff.. What can I say you GOTTA go.."}
{"text":"WOW Where do we begin?! ANY 5 star review on here is PAID for or a friend of the owners! I would give this 0 Stars if I could.

Lets start from the beginning... We got seated on the patio at a dirty table that the bus boy had to come over and wipe down a few minutes after sitting down. THEN we wait... and wait... and wait some more. 15 minutes go by and we have not even been greeted! On top of that another party that was seated 10 minutes after us got greeted before us and got their order in!!  Finally a waitress comes by and says she will send someone to be right with us. Then we waited again, and the initial waitress ends up coming back to take our drink order. So 20 minutes in and already off to a rough start. We ordered drinks and food all at once because we figured we would not see our waitress again.

As we sit and wait on the patio near the lake we get bombed with a million nats flying around the water. Gross. Then our meal comes, the coconut shrimp and the Albuquerque turkey. The 5 tiny coconut shrimp was tasteless and you could only taste the breading (not worth the $12 tag). The turkey sandwich was sub-par. As we eat, we order another sangria which never came after waiting over 10 minutes. By then we had finished our meal and did not want the sangria so we told the waiter to just take it off our bill and close us out.

During our dinner we experienced the sight of other patrons waiting as well for their servers and obviously getting very frustrated. One lady even demanded a manager which came and offered free food I believe. Another elderly couple looked upset as their drinks were empty throughout and waiting forever for their check to leave. 

As we left I wanted to briefly speak to the manager to simply express my concerns and experience in hopes it could miraculously make this place better. I initially asked one of the servers near the front host desk to grab the manager for me please. She said ok, and then I began to wait. After waiting a good 5 minutes I asked the host to please grab the manager for me. She continues to walk into the kitchen to tell the manager... and the next thing I hear is a loud 4 letter F bomb! ****! Then the hostess comes out of the kitchen and tells me \"THE MANAGER IS REALLY BUSY RIGHT NOW AND CANT SPEAK TO YOU\". HAHAHA! Never in my life have I been denied to speak to a manager in any establishment. What a joke this place is!

Come to find out the managers name is Matt and I guess he is part owner. What a shame this place is going to crash before it can even get built up.

Recommendation: STAY FAR AWAY from this place! There are much better places to go to with better food and WAY better service.

And to the owners, Matt and \"Dan Scott\" DO NOT contact me or offer me to adjust my review or offer free food. PLEASE DO US A FAVOR and get OUT of the RESTAURANT business ASAP.  And why do you continue to call it a \"soft opening\" when you've been open for over 3 months! Get outa here! And Dan quit replying to everyones bad reviews and talking about your personal life and your sorry newspaper in NM. No one gives a rats. You seem so selfish and disgusting you make me want to throw up, and I don't even know you.

Oh and also, read this link for a \"professional\" review if you don't believe my critique.

{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day Brunch. The food, service, and views were all amazing!! We sat on the patio. The drinks were great! I had the shrimp Diablo pasta... So good! After we took a boat ride it was so much fun and so relaxing! I would definitely come again!!"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic Father's Day meal at The Watershed. We had a party of 9, so lots of different meals were eaten. I had the tenderloin with potatoes and asparagus. It was truly delicious! 
Service was excellent, even with our big group. We all left feeling very happy with our experience. 
We will definitely make The Watershed a regular place for family gatherings."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been coming here since the grand opening and although the servers are great and are always trying to do what they can to make it enjoyable the management is always coming up with excuses as to why food takes so long to get delivered and try to shortcut the \"discounts\" they have given us for the inconvenience. Last time we were here we waited an hour and forty five minutes for NACHOS! Then they offered a discount and gave us ONE round of drinks for free when everything else was five times the cost. They gave us a \"free appetizer\" gift card for our next visit which when we tried to use, they tried to say was only good for the cheapest item we purchased when I specifically told them I wanted the free appetizer to be applied to the nachos we ordered again in good faith. Give this place a year to get their act together and the view and food might be worth it but at this point we have gone from frequent customers to disgusted patrons. Don't waste your time

UPDATE: After this review the GM was more than helpful and personally addressed this issue. The experience was frustrating but it was just a perfect storm and nobody is perfect. We have been back a few times since this first review and the service and food has been top notch!"}
{"text":"We have been going The Watershed for years so it holds a special place in our hearts... you truly can't find a better atmosphere and view - such a great gathering place for friends. 
My best friend battled cancer for nearly 15 years so when she went to hospice (at only 38 years old)- we planned her celebration of life together and she immediately wanted it to be at The Watershed because it held so many memories we all treasured. 
I can't even begin to express how incredible the entire staff made our experience... obviously a very emotional process, but Sharmayne and the crew truly went above and beyond from our very first meeting. Sharmayne worked closely with us so we could create the vision our dear friend had for this very important event. Sharmayne was detailed, compassionate, and extremely accommodating to our every need - she truly went out of her way to make it all happen. 
The day of the event... it couldn't have been more perfect. The entire staff - from the bartenders, the audio/visual help, the boat captain, the servers --- everything was exactly how we had envisioned it to be... and even better. There were a few hundred people there throughout the four hours we had reserved and so many people complimented the entire experience.... it was beautiful and the staff was extraordinary. 
I highly recommend The Watershed for any event --- if they can pull off a Celebration of Life with ease, compassion, and attention to every detail for hundreds of guests --- they can handle anything! We are forever grateful for the wonderful celebration and cherished memories they all helped us create.

{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, great food. My dad loved the German beer. I've had the Lakehouse Pie and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Visiting The Watershed we found that the food was enjoyable but nothing specifically exciting.  We ordered chicken fejitas and green enchiladas.  I was disappointed to find that the chicken in each was the from the same recipe just with different additional items.  The chicken just didn't have the expected southwestern kick.

Noting the other reviews, we thought the service might be a risk but while there we found the service to be excellent.  In addition, the atmosphere was relaxed and comfortable when we were there for lunch on Saturday.  There was live music in the bar, but we were not too impressed and chose to sat in the dining room."}
{"text":"Great, Unique atmosphere...beautiful sunsets on the waterfront patio. Can't wait for the official grand opening when the inside renovations are complete. :)"}
{"text":"I will admit I was a little concerned given some of the reviews but we had a wonderful experience!  Our waiter was very friendly and attentive and we received our food and drinks in a very timely manner.  I had the Greek Penne Pasta with the pan seared salmon.  It was absolutely delicious.  We sat outside on the patio which has a very pretty view overlooking the lake.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Even with reservations they're saying an hour wait because the kitchen is backed up. Poor planning for sure."}
{"text":"I've been to The Watershed before for Happy Hours and also a Wedding reception. Being on the lake makes for a wonderful ambience. I grew up in the neighborhood and my mom lives within walking distance. We made a reservation for a table for 6 to celebrate her 65th birthday. When we arrived, a hostess didn't greet us for at least 5 minutes. We were sat and ordered beverages while deciding what to order. As we started to place orders our server informed us they were out of everything we had in mind. It's worth mentioning these were common items: Tenderloin, Fresh Catch, Chicken Fingers, Etc. She made no attempt to offer alternate dishes. We made the decision to leave for another restaurant but attempted to order Pretzel Bites to finish our drinks and tide my daughters over until we could get to our next place. They were out of those too!  They blamed it on a busy weekend. When we left and explained why to the manager on duty, she was apologetic and gave us a free boat ride coupon but made no attempt to comp our check or offer anything further. The GM was supposed to call my sister the next day but never did. It's a shame to see a non-franchised and local restaurant fail at service and food quality. I'm not sure my mom, her nearby friends or I will ever be back."}
{"text":"The one thing that is first and foremost about any type of dining establishment is People, hey, that's what I am, a person, and I'm betting that's what you are too! So, if the people are made of good stuff, well that equals service, its there, in people, like you and like me; rather you feel it or not on your sometimes limited lst time experience. people=service=profit! None of my concern, profit! But I really get the people and service thing; and thousands like me get it to, cause that's the experience you'll get every time when step into the dining experience at the Watershed, I mean good food, good music, oh, and good people. It's ambience experience is matched by none south of Frank Lloyd. Right in your backyard! its like your hometown bar away from your hometown!"}
{"text":"Great location in The Lakes!  Perfect for happy hour.  Nice selection of wine, beer, and cocktails.  Try the ginger margarita!"}
{"text":"Though just in a \"soft\" opening state I already am a fan of this restaurant. The green chili meatloaf was fabulous with delicious steamed veggies and mashed potatoes on the side. I can't wait for the weather to warm up a bit and they add Sunday brunch to the repertoire. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of the best building and surrounding areas you could ask for in AZ, but very poorly managed! We keep going back for the convenience (it's within walking distance of our house) and for the scenery.  One of the times we went we sat at the bar and listened to a waitress complain for about an hour about having to cut ginger, which she was cutting on the bar that everyone was drinking at. I've felt every meal we've had there wasn't that great and was very overpriced."}
{"text":"Had the buffalo chicken wrap and it was good but the chips were very plain. Nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Beautiful location. The service and food is horrible. Slow service. Waiter forgot to bring some drinks. We ordered chips and salsa - by far the worst salsa I've had at a restaurant. I ordered the green chile meatloaf which was actually pretty good. My wife ordered fish-and-chips.  The fish literally tasted like cardboard - no taste. In my humble opinion, people that give this place good reviews are not doing it based on the food and service. Probably a good place for happy hour, playing games, and eating/munching once you're drunk. 

The kitchen - food and service - needs revamping.  Once that is fixed, this place will be great. 

Unfortunately, we won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Great patio right on the water and you MUST try the Huckleberry Lemonade!  We tried three appetizers and loved them all.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great family environment. They were very busy with reservations and made room for our family to enjoy he sunset and a boat ride."}
{"text":"Had reservations on Sunday. Got seated outdoors tucked away at the last table. No one bothered to make an appearance to take our order. After some time, I got up and mentioned to a server that we needed some service. He said someone would be with us, but was pretty curt and indifferent. Waited some more, but no one bothered to make their way to our end of the patio. After waiting some more time, we decided not to waste away the afternoon hoping someone would grace us with their presence. Won't be coming back. The lake looked murky and awful,too."}
{"text":"Great view, hence the two stars. We went there about a dozen times over the last two years since the restaurant opened. The food was just below average at first at above average prices. After the novelty had worn off, we didn't go for a while until a few weeks ago. Unfortunately, the food got even worse, much worse. Won't go again unless there are dramatic changes to the quality of the food, the management, the menu, and the drinks (totally watered down). What a shame because the location and the view is great, and we live in walking distance. We are rooting for the Watershed, but the way it is right now, it is not worth going there."}
{"text":"We came here because they said the had a dog friendly patio. It was nice, a beautiful view. The service absolutely sucks. My husband and I owned an Italian restaurant in San Diego for 11 years. When we were super busy we ALWAYS greeted our customers with a smile. Not once did we get that.  We were told to go out to the patio and wait for our table. Ok, we ordered drinks that took 20 minutes at the bar to get. Meanwhile I sat outside with the dog. There were 5 empty tables, I finally saw the hostess who said that the place we were sitting someone else requested to sit there, she asked if we had our name on the list???? You took our name!!!! Basically  at that point we left.... They need to educate their staff on friendliness. Get a manager that cares and maybe it will run smoother. Never going back. Oh plus it smelled like rotten eggs."}
{"text":"My sisters & I took my mother here for Sunday lunch to celebrate her birthday. Let me start off by saying the food was delicious and very reasonably priced! Our service, however, was lacking. Our waitress, whose name we never got, started off by not knowing the soup of the day. Then when asked if the French dip could be prepared without mushrooms, she did not know and acted like she was unsure if she should go ask. My sister got frustrated waiting for an answer and ordered something else. They use smart phones to put orders in to the kitchen, and she seemed to not be familiar with that or the menu, as she stumbled around on the phone, and repeatedly looked at my sister's open menu.
The food arrived in a timely manner, but none of the dishes were brought by our waitress, but rather by an attentive young gentleman with an amazing personality. I told my sister that he deserves the tip, and not the gal who, at this point, just took our order. When she asked him if he would get the tip we leave, he told us he was the Manager. At this point, my sister & I felt it necessary to let him know our experience with his waitress. I let him know I thought this was her first or second day on the job, (He said she'd been working there \"a while\".) and that we wanted the tip to go to him. (He assured us it would.)
From that point on, Zack (the Mgr) repeatedly returned to our table to see how the meal was going, bring us any additional items, take our dessert order, wish our Mom happy birthday, and joke around a bit. The only time we saw our waitress was to refill drinks, or to ask how the food was AFTER Zack had brought it all out. She wasn't even the one to bring the bill; Zack brought it out!
Had it not been for Zack, I would have given The Watershed only 2 points but he made our dining experience a fantastic one! I would definitely go there again."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Fantastic views, great ownership, friendly staff, and the best on the lake view in Tempe. This will be my new go to place to have some drinks and hear some live music"}
{"text":"We were very excited to try this restaurant for der, but unfortunately left very disappointed.  First it took approximately 20 minutes to get menus, and this took me going up to the hostess station to get myself.  You should probably order more menus if your hostess is not able to provide when she seats a customer.

After we ordered, we waited close to an hour for our food to arrive.  Yes, it was a Friday, but hardly \"busy\" in comparison to any other restaurant.  Most people decided that the wait wasn't worth it and left.

The food when it arrived was below average.  I ordered the burger, which I figured would be quick and hard to mess up.  Unfortunately half the toppings I ordered were missing and I wasn't about to wait another hour for it to be corrected.  My date's pork sandwich was average, but I wouldn't order again if given the opportunity.  The fries were cold.  Other items on the menu sounded more appealing, but for the location and type of restaurant, way too expensive.   $15 for an entree is too high for the area and quality, and I doubt too many people would be willing to order those entrees after waiting 20 minutes before receiving a menu.  Also, $7 for a craft pint is twice the price of anywhere else in the area.    Overall, a 2 hour dining experience not by choice.

Unfortunately, I will not return.  This was the second time I have been to this restaurant and it is the second time I have left disappointed.  I would have been willing to try again if a manager was willing to make customary rounds and apologize to customers for the horrible service (every table around us was complaining about the hour long wait for food to get to the table)."}
{"text":"Initially there was a mixup with our reservation but the management of The Watershed truly went over and above to fix it. Because of their efforts it turned out to be an even better celebration than we had planned. The appetizers, drinks and meals were exceptional and the customer service from management was more than professional. What a delightful visit, will be going back often."}
{"text":"Awesome Tuesday night open mic night!!!!  Brought an out of town guest...was perfect!"}
{"text":"Gorgeous setting!  Yummy appetizers and fun drinks.  We brought our teenagers and they loved the outdoor darts and picnic tables overlooking the water.  Our daughter want to bring friends for her birthday dinner.  Yes to the fish bites and green chili fries!"}
{"text":"The place was very nice inside and outside. Two of us ordered the ribs and they were the saltest ribs I had ever tasted, The slaw was also very salty along with the french fries, I felt like i just washed my mouth out with salt water. We mentioned it to the waitress but she did not do anything. We won't be backj"}
{"text":"Just Horrible. Save yourself the trip and stay away. The food was slow, mediocre, and we (along with others it appeared) received absolutely horrendous service by every single staff member there, including the manager. We stopped in for a \"quick\" bite with our kids, when we tried to put an order in after our server finally showed up having already been waiting for over 15 min at a table, the appetizer never came.... we waited another 10-15 min to receive waters, and then finally had the opportunity to order our meal only to wait another 45min for the incomplete food order.... The completely ineffectual manager awkwardly came to apologize for our crappy experience... only he never actually did apologize.... He gave an excuse of being understaffed, which might explain the slow service, but not the poor attitude  from the nearly non-existent service. This place is a waste of an amazing location. I feel robbed of my time and my money, I will not be back, and I will tell pretty much everyone to stay away. Like all the places before it.... this one appears to be another bust."}
{"text":"This was a nice spot to sit and enjoy the live music and a glass of wine. My friend had a sandwich that was very good and I had the nachos...can't wait to try other dishes on the  menu."}
{"text":"We had our daughters college graduation party in the Captain's Room and it was wonderful:)  The server, Nick, was very attentive:)  We had a Taco bar set up and everyone was raving about the food!  We had chicken, crispy pork, beef  and all the fixins.....rice, beans, a big salad, salsas, etc:)  It was great because everyone could eat as they wanted to and it all stayed warm:)  As the sun went down, we moved outside to play darts and some people went out for a boat ride.!  It was perfect:)  The views are amazing and the sun set was stunning on the water.
I would highly recommend the Watershed!"}
{"text":"We are pretty new to the area, but at one point, was looking at homes in the area so I was so excited to read about this restaurant. Locals boat around the lake and pull right up to the dock. We arrived at 3pm on a Saturday and there was maybe, a dozen guests in the whole place. We were seated immediately next to the lake and it was so pretty and very much a neighborhood environment. We let 3 different people know at three different times that we wanted to go for a boat ride since it was our first time. Two hours later, we left, no boat ride. We just got tired of asking.

Pros,
we were seated quickly
our food came to us quickly
So nice to just sit outside in the sunshine on a lake

Cons
Our water was never refilled or a refill offered
the food was not good: overcooked, boxed mac n cheese
slider was bland, not even piece of lettuce or tomato. There was just no love in the food, or what a restaurant is, like filling up a water glass or topper on your coffee, a hostess that comes to your table and asks how everything is. 

I could see us going to this place for a beer or glass of wine and watch the sunset, but that is about it. It's not a neighborhood café with a chef that loves his craft, the wait staff down the block at Denny's is 100xs more attentive to their guests and more professional. Eat elsewhere and come here for a drink and the game."}
{"text":"Though still in the midst of a renovation the interior was organized, clean and one can see the potential finished product will look amazing. Friendly staff, outstanding view from the patio : complete with adorable ducks and nearby residents in kayaks paddling by. 
I was underwhelmed by their vegetarian options but thats nothing new to me. I scoped out their grilled cheese and a side of fries. My mom got the red chile salad w shrimp. Our server was quick, friendly and kept our glasses topped off which I always appreciate. 
The food came out within 10 minutes. Perfectly presented, and i really have to say it: for a grilled cheese w fries it was Beautiful. Perfectly done. And the taste! Out of this world. I haven't had a meal exceed my expectations like this grilled cheese did in a long time! They use some amazing herbs and the cheese blend is fantastic! 
Fries were Cajun spicy! Addictive! Ma's salad was fantastic, the grilled shrimp perfectly grilled and marinated. Her words: \"i would eat this again for dinner tonight if I could.\"
  Bread pudding for desert! Don't even get me started! You'll just have to go there and experience it for yourself. 5 stars. Will be back and with those super reasonable prices it'll be sooner rather than later!"}
{"text":"We came here last night for Valentine's Day. Great views but unfortunately service and food were not so great. Our server often forgot about us I actually had to have others call her for us, even having to get up and actually walk up to here to pay our bill then wait at front door for our receipt. Horrible. Our food had no taste missing flavor and smaller portions for the price. We go to lots of restaurants so definitely know quality. Maybe because this was their Valentine's menu I'm not sure restaurant was not packed so the service we received has no excuse. Maybe regular menu with lower prices might have been a better choice. On the upside at the end of the night we did take a boat ride I have to say that I did give an extra star because the captain of the boat helped our night he was very knowledgeable and kind."}
{"text":"Only two tables occupied yet refused service because 'only one waitress'... Didn't make sense but trying not to read too much into it."}
{"text":"Hosted my company's 10 year anniversary party at this restaurant. Rave reviews by everyone that attended.   wondering where this best-kept secret came from.  Right on the water and the coolest lay out ever. We had over 300 people and only used up one side of the restaurant.  Great service and so accommodating to our group"}
{"text":"sever was great as were host staff..no wait time, even though we requested a table change.  Serving time a tad longer then we like, but not bad. Food : fish and chips were great..other entrees marginal appetizers average. May suggest list spicy or minor spicy (mother in law got the Sheppard's pie and the beef was to spicy for her. View amazing"}
{"text":"Living in the Lakes, I really wanted to like this restaurant. Great location and view....so much potential. Unfortunately, our last few visits have been disappointing.  We went there for dinner about a month ago, a family of five with three kids, along with another family. A Saturday night and we were almost the only ones there. Despite the lack of a crowd, the service was slow and the food was a total disappointment. My friend ordered steak, well done...it came out rare. My husband's fish tacos were unrecognizable. Even the kids complained that the food wasn't all that great. The server would disappear for 15 minutes and then be stopping by every 2 minutes. The wine selection needs a major upgrade. The selection of draft and craft beer is one of the shining stars. 

The previous experience was for Sunday brunch. We had a reservation but were told that even though they could seat us, the kitchen was backed up and it would be at least 45 minutes until we could get our food. Barely any service in the meantime. 

This restaurant could be a winner but mediocre food and inconsistent service are a recipe for disaster."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to give this place a shot, I don't understand the negative reviews because we absolutely loved everything about this place. Our waiter was Ken, he was friendly, attentive, and offered excellent suggestions. The food was amazing and cocktails came in a nice presentation. I got the enchiladas and the Lakeshore martini. Great atmosphere, great service, romantic lighting, clean, food to die for, it was a little smokey but we were sitting outside not a big deal. All in all a lovely experience, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The watershed!!!! The  ambiance, great beer selection!!! Come check it out!!server was great food was decent."}
{"text":"Great view of the lakes, tastefully remodeled, food was good, great place to take a date BUT service was beyond poor. When I say poor I don't mean they had bad attitudes. The staff is either very green or poorly trained. Drinks (water) shouldn't take 20 minutes to receive. A table of 3 shouldn't be plated with 5-10 minute increments between. I have gone twice because I like to give every place a second chance but I will not return until management trains and staffs up the place. This could be a gold mine for the owners and new hot spot for Tempe once they correct the issues."}
{"text":"We were at The Watershed last night for the very first time and had the most enjoyable experience. We were there for a fundraiser event, so it was a bit crowded as expected, but the food was great, the drinks were cheap, and the view... couldn't beat it. To end the night, a peaceful pontoon boat ride (it's electric!) took us around the lake. They even provided blankets for us. 
We love The Watershed and can't wait to head back there. We met the most amazing people there.  It feels like hanging out at a friends' house/backyard.... LOVE IT !!!!"}
{"text":"I want to say that I enjoyed my visit, but I would be lying. I arrived here a few weeks ago with a large party for dinner. I had ordered water and the caesar salad ($8) with grilled chicken ($4) because I wanted a healthy option. Had I know that the portion would be the size of my palm, I would have never stepped foot in the restaurant. When my plate was put in front of me I knew I had gotten screwed over big time. I had read the reviews beforehand, and people really did mean it when they said you're paying for the view and that the food is tasteless, but I had no choice since another girl had made the reservations. My total was $16 after they added state tax, city tax, and a VERY generous gratuity which they did not deserve since it took about 30 minutes for our food to be served. In my honest opinion, don't bother coming here."}
{"text":"Went for dinner to check out this place ! The view of the lake is amazing ! It's a shame that the inside of this restaurant is boring . The wait staff is polite but needs more training . The food is overpriced and the menu is limited. The only reason I gave this place 3 stars is because the fish & chips I had was actually very good. Well at least you have an amazing view while you ponder over their limited menu !"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing, great ambiance, view and food!  Casual atmosphere with food and hand crafted cocktails. The wings and pretzel bites are a favorite!!"}
{"text":"We had my daughter's baby shower out on the back, overlooking the water. I was so very very impressed with the whole experience, and the staff. Our server, Michael, was truly one of the best. He was there for anything we needed, made us laugh, and just made sure everyone had a great time.
 Hannah was super helpful with the planning, and let us annoy her with grace, lol.  Even the one tiny hiccup in the plans was quickly resolved and the manager was very understanding and quick to move it along.  
The food. .... beautiful, delicious and perfect for a shower. The setting was gorgeous as the sun went down, and people even took boat rides (offered by the venue) I would recommend it to anyone looking to do an intimate party setting that allows you to add your personal touches. 
One small thing: parking spaces can get scarce since it's a fairly modest lot in front of the restaurant, but if you don't mind a walk, there is overflow parking."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time on Thursday night. Nice view on the water but the atmosphere and service has a lot of room for improvement. It was too hot inside. Had to hunt down wait staff to get a menu, place an order and pay for it. My power green salad didn't have everything in it that the menu said it would for example no spinach, no bacon. It was over priced. I got a much better salad at Bourbon Jack in Chandler for much less and a drink for about the same price on Tuesday.  I don't recommend this place and don't have any plans to return."}
{"text":"Summary: Great location, deplorably managed.

It would have seemed an incredible location for a sunny afternoon brunch for a family after seeing Santa Claus in the middle of the lake, an annual event here. After the experience we had, we will not be back and would *never* recommend it to anyone. 

The problems boil down to profoundly inept management. Busy holiday event for kids next door? Don't bother to print kids menus or stock enough kids drink cups. Host seats a family? Be sure not to notify a server, so the family can wait for 25 minutes to get water and drinks and quick appetizers. Food arrives, no one has silverware or napkins? Make sure at least three waitstaff ignore the request before someone brings utensils. Server forgets to bring water or place appetizer order? Manager should be sure to offer an insincere apology and shrug it off and be sure not to try to make it right.

The problems were consistent across the board: a family docked their boat and claimed a spot (bussing their own table in the process), then eventually flagged down a host/busser and, some time later, a server. Another couple who had been seated had the same issue. By the time we had left, literally no one else on the deck had received appetizers or food of any sort.

The food was adequate, eventually, but the main attraction is location. It is a shame when you waste money and time visiting a restaurant, especially one that could be great if anyone running the place had any f*@#$ing clue what they were doing."}
{"text":"Horrible evening. Burnt pretzel appetizer. Waiter that is running by all night. Never asking how things are going. Jambalaya is so bland.. Rice is clumpy and not cooked. Would not suggest this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We were beyond disappointed with the taste and very, very poor presentation of the appetizers we ordered off of their Special Events Menu for a graduation party. I was a little concerned about the price when I booked the party, but figured it would be worth it, as the place is beautiful and location perfect, they probably know what they're doing. Nope. NOT the kitchen staff, and DEFINITELY not who is in charge of letting such unappealing, low end product out of the kitchen. I was wrong to assume that because they because have a Special Events Menu and great ambiance, that the food would be awesome. So wrong. I would be embarrassed to serve, not to mention charge, for that garbage. The service was there, but with low energy. I felt like every time I looked around, there were friends and family with empty drinks and empty cups/glassware in front of them. We left the Watershed feeling like we just got bent over the barrel and paid top dollar for it."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the rating would be higher if the bartender paid more attention to the paying patrons than his friend at the end of the bar.  The friend was not even female.  Food is above expectations and I was pleased. Good atmosphere and good crowd. Would definitely comeback but I need to remember to order two drinks at time to accommodate the non-attentive bartender."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this place! The lakefront  makes you forget you're in the desert. Sitting on the deck with your friends as the sun goes down with the lake in the background= PICTURE PERFECT. The food and drinks are always good and reasonably priced. Staff is always so friendly. All of which makes me come back for more time and time again."}
{"text":"I would give it a zero if that was an option. 11 of my family members went here for a Mother's Day brunch as they were advertising it on Facebook. We were the first ones to arrive. The waiter was slow to begin with and our order was taken about 30 minutes after we arrived. We still did not have our food two hours after we were there. We are still waiting on our second round of drinks also. We saw one table get food within the two hours we were there and they were served at different times. Clearly management needs to fix many things at this establishment. It definitely will be a Mother's Day to Remember. Off to McDonald's we go."}
{"text":"4 stars for location - love the waterfront spot. 2 stars because the food and drinks were not good. Drinks are watered down and despite how the website reads, it doesn't appear a mixologist was involved in making their menu. 

Staff is courteous and normally this would make my ratings increase but the food was not good. Bruschetta, which seems simple enough, was barely toasted, though edible, just ok. Wings were flabby - neither grilled nor fried. Not good. Overall just not the level of food and drink I want to pay for when going out. Their prices are average so it's not like you're \"getting what you pay for\" by receiving this level of food and drink. I love the location, but sadly I probably won't return."}
{"text":"Beautiful patio seating, with gas heaters to take the chill off.  No problem there.  Water view is very nice.  I entered through the patio and didn't see all the construction taking place indoors until I was leaving.  Maybe they should have finished the construction projects before they opened?  However, the construction was not the problem on this night.  The server was very friendly, and I truly felt sorry for him, because clearly the disorganization was not his fault.  The meal for our party of 8 came in four separate shifts.  The lag from the first two meals being delivered to the last one being delivered was nearly 10 minutes.   Mind you... it was after dark and chilly outside.  This left the first two diners with the choice of eating while others didn't yet have their meals, or waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and then eating cold food.  Unacceptable, and inexcusable-- not that there was anybody there who seemed to be aware enough to even offer an excuse.    Where was the help for this waiter???   A party of 8 is not a party of 20, and should be easily manageable-- especially since it wasn't busy.  Not a manager/assistant/owner/busboy/cook/runner in sight to help carry food.   I didn't see a single table inside, and it appeared that the majority of the half dozen tables sitting outside were mostly just drinking.  To the owner/manager--- please know that you are building your reputation NOW, soft opening or not.  If you don't have adequate service when the restaurant is nearly empty, what will you do on a genuinely busy night?  I will give this restaurant another chance (others would say NO WAY!), because the view is nice and the poor waiter seemed to have been set up for failure by the management and/or owner."}
{"text":"Good food , drinks, environment and view! We ordered argentina burger, mahi mahi sandwich. Moscow mule and a hurricane! All came out on point.
We chose to sit inside and still got a nice view of the lake."}
{"text":"To quote Tarantino from Reservoir Dogs \" The words to f@&!ng busy shouldn't be in a waiters vocabulary. \" 
I cannot comment on much as we didn't stay very long. To be seated and have the only greeting you get from your waiter in 15 minutes be I'll be right back...twice...was a preview for what we had in store for us for the evening and grounds for departure. Management was very nice and apologetic and gave us a free appetizer for a return visit but unfortunately Valentines night and our anticipation to try this new restaurant was ruined because of poor service . Any one can have an off night it's just to bad it was tonight. Wish this place all the luck."}
{"text":"It was down to the Rueben or the the Lakeshore Pie.  Server, Steve suggested the Pie.  Turns out.....  phenomenal!!!!!!  I'd get it again in an hour.  After a couple of laps around the building..."}
{"text":"It would be easier if I told you the things that went right during our visit last night:
We were with our good friends.

From the moment we walked it, it was a shit show. We reserved a table on the patio. We did not get a patio table. Instead, we were seated in the corner inside. We waited a very long time for someone to come to our table. A lovely gal named Marisa came to wait on us. She apologized we had to wait stating she had just arrived and wasn't scheduled to work and got called in. 

There may have been two servers working in the entire restaurant. We then waited some more for our drinks. Then we waited for our appetizer. We should've taken a cue from our neighbors at the table behind us who just plain walked out after their food was delivered and not to their liking. We then were visited by the manager who looked like he had been on a bender all day; he was wearing a t-shirt and plaid shorts. His shirt was a Lululemon shirt and he read us the quote on the inside of the seam about living happy, pursuing dreams and enjoying a few beers along the way. Pretty sure he had taken his shirt's advice. This is our introduction to him! He then offered us a round of drinks on the house. We waited for those for another 15 minutes. Still waiting for our meals. When they came out, they were cold. Got our free drinks 3/4 of the way they our meals. 

To make a long painful story short, it was the worst service ever. Marisa must have been the only poor soul who picked up the phone when her employer called her and asked her to come in. Dinner and drinks took
2 1/2 hours!"}
{"text":"Fun, local neighborhood place.   Nice people, good food.   Unique setting as it is on the water in tempe arizona."}
{"text":"Pretty cool place in Tempe AZ.   ON THE WATER.  Still needs A LOT of work inside as the bar wasn't even built yet. Not sure where they were actually making the drinks but at least they are open and the views are stunning.  
Try the Signature Martini Menu.  Quite creative!"}
{"text":"Disappointed is not the only word I can think of to describe our evening. We decided to come here for a nice Mother's Day dinner and made a reservation. When we arrived we asked the hostess (who was wearing a dress you would see in a club...we literally almost saw her butt cheeks) if we could switch the table she brought us to to another table closer to the water. She said there's a reservation. No one sat at the table the entire time we were there and the place was completely empty for that matter. The food was absolutely awful and barely a decent portion. Our bill wound up being over 200$ for terrible food and not the best service. We didn't even get asked if we wanted dessert and when we asked for dessert, apparently there wasn't any. Then we asked for coffee and we were told \"Well I can go make you some.\" Unprofessional comment, but sure we went along with it and ordered. The server came back and all of a sudden said they didn't have any coffee. Right... We complained to our waiter about the evening and nothing was done about it. No mentioning to a manager or having a manager come over and speak with us. We were frustrated and just completely over it. I can see why automatic gratuity was added because the server probably wouldn't have received anywhere near the auto grat amount. The fact that it was 20% is outrageous and the server was definitely not deserving of that money. As we were leaving, the whole staff was joking around and lounging around the restaurant area. Beyond unprofessional attire and behavior. This day was poorly planned and executed. We will never come back here. Made this Mother's Day dinner feel like a huge waste."}
{"text":"We had a graduation event here and were really pleased with the great atmosphere.  We had the vegetable tray, pretzel bites, chicken satays, griddle burgers, chips & salsa tray with guacamole and gazpacho shooters as well as several meals.  The only item that didn't go over well was the gazpacho shooters.  Heather provided excellent service and the event was a success!!   Loved the view of the lake!"}
{"text":"They changed up their menu and it was amazing! Even better then before! The manager Heather came over and talked to us and made sure everything was good. That was very nice of her! She was great and the service too. Will be back"}
{"text":"You guys!! I am SO disappointed in this place. My husband and I got married here 8 years ago (it was called The Waterfront at the time and only a wedding venue) and we went there last night to celebrate our anniversary. I was SO excited all week getting to come back to such a special place to us. I had no idea they had made it into a restaurant! We had a TERRIBLE experience. I am not one to complain but it was awful. We decided to sit outside (because I was being nostalgic and wanted to eat in the area we got married) and were only one of two couples who braved the cold outside. Our waiter started off great. Nice, friendly and attentive. He had a girl shadowing him. He got our initial drinks for us, took our order after we ate our appetizer and everything was great up to this point. Well it took almost 45 minutes for our food to come out to us. Cold and stale to be exact. In the meantime, my husband never got his drink refilled, I had to drink his water because they never refilled mine. Ridiculous. It was a Tuesday night. Come on! Our waiter finally brought our food to us and apologized saying my medium well steak took a while to cook. 45 minutes?!?! What? At least come out and check on us and tell us why we are waiting. But nope, didn't get that courtesy. We ate. My husbands burger was fine, but the French fries tasted like they had been microwaved. My food was so-so... not worth $29. THEN once we were done, we sat there for a while talking. We were on a date, so it's not like we were trying to rush too fast, but it was getting really cold and we needed to get home to our kids. We waited and waited and I finally had to ask the other waiter from the other table for our check (which I didn't understand why he just wasn't our waiter when there were only two couples outside?) he said let me go get your waiter and let him know you are ready. I looked down at my watch to see what time it was. It took our waiter 16 minutes to come bring us our check. I just don't get it. He had a girl shadowing him. She should have come check on us if he was so busy inside. He finally came back out and gave us our check and apologized for the lack of service. Even he knew he was terrible. He tried giving us a free boat ride. Umm it was 8pm... dark and cold. Why would we go on a boat ride at this time? I'm just so disappointed. I wanted to love it and have it an annual place we return on our anniversary, but honestly don't think I would waste the money again. We really wanted to bring our 3 kids here to show them where we got married. Something needs to change or this beautiful place won't be around much longer and that breaks my heart. Unless things change, don't waste your money, or just go to have drinks and enjoy the beautiful deck."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for an afternoon drink and was very pleased. The inside was very nice . We sat outside on the deck which was an amazing atmosphere. The service was very prompt and our waitress was great . We had the queso fun dido which was delicious. They had a great selection of draft beer as well."}
{"text":"We have been to the Watershed twice now and absolutely love it! I just don't get the negative reviews but everyone is entitled to an opinion. The views of the lake and the homes around it are breathtaking. The hostesses, servers and bartenders are extremely friendly and constantly check back to see it you need anything else. The Happy Hour is one of the best around with 2 for1 drinks. Their HH Specials are delicious as well as the regular menu. Especially the mahi mahi. We will return again. Next time for the $5.00 boat ride around the lake and some more good food."}
{"text":"Awesome!! Drinks are good service is good and so are the bartenders! Come see London hes an awesone bartender!!"}
{"text":"I use Yelp all the time to research restaurants and always think of writing a review myself but never have. Last night I had such a poor experience I felt compelled to share it, so alas, my first review.

The only good things about this meal were my date, the atmosphere, and the glass of Sauvignon Blanc I got. When we sat down, I asked the waitress about their white sangria and whether it was super sweet (since some are more than others). She looked at me like I was insane and a nuisance and we had this very awkward exchange. She said she had no idea what it tastes like. I think if you work at a restaurant you should at least be knowledgable about the general taste of things. She offered to get me a sample, but again, she made me feel like such an inconvenience I did not take her up on that, although now I wish I had. Needless to say, I ordered the sangria and it was basically sweetened water (aka no alcohol, I swear). I finally had to ask her for water because she never brought it and we were dying of thirst considering we're in summer temps now. As my date put it, the waitress had the personality of a rock. 

Now, onto the food. Oh my gosh, save your $80 (how much our meal was before tip). I think the atmosphere here is very cool and this is a great spot to go for a drink (just not the sangria) but go elsewhere for food. We shared the shrimp cocktail, jambalaya, and ahi tuna salad. 

Where do I begin? We asked for the shrimp cocktail to come out first, plus it's an appetizer so it should anyway. The shrimp cocktail arrived just a couple minutes before everything else so we got this onslaught of mediocre food at once. The shrimp cocktail wasn't that fresh but it was better than the rest of the food. The jambalaya was nothing like jambalaya I've had before. It looked and tasted more like spiced-up Rice-A-Roni with only a few pieces of chicken, andouille sausage, and shrimp. It was not what you think you're getting when you order cajun food. Now, the salad was the worst. The ahi tuna was tough and did NOT seem safe to eat. We both agreed the texture and taste was very off. The salad was supposed to have avocados and didn't, and the tomatoes were not fresh -- even though we are in tomato season! Finally, the wasabi-ginger dressing was super weird and reminded me of the taste of a Christmas cookie with nutmeg.

Usually I tell the server if the food is this bad, but I guess I chickened out and just didn't have the heart. Which is silly considering the waitress did not check in on us to see how the food was and didn't pick up on the fact we may not have enjoyed it since there was a TON of food left on every plate. You'd think someone would see that and ask if something was wrong. I felt horrible my date paid that much for a meal that left me feeling like I wanted another meal after, since I probably ate a total of five bites. We won't be going back here except for a drink and the vibe. It's a shame that a place with such a cool location on the water and an alluring atmosphere has such poor service and food."}
{"text":"Been in here a few times with a few friends, but this last time took the cake as I was enjoying my beer I had to listen to what I assume is some sort of a manager complain very unprofessionally about the employees on shift. You know because patrons want to hear all a businesses dirty laundry. He then finished his drink, not water by the way and magically found himself behind the bar. You know because intoxicated employees behind the bar does the liquor board proud. Whats the point of having a beautiful location if the service makes you question who actually runs this place. Although I will say the wings were pretty good but I can also get them somewhere that doesn't have fly's buzzing all over them. All in all this place needs help which is a shame because the location has some killer views."}
{"text":"This was our first (and last) visit.  We chose it for the patio views, which were beautiful. We arrived promptly for a 6pm reservation and by 6:20 were begging to have someone take our order.  The food finally arrived at 7pm, a full hour after we were seated, and even then the tri-tip sandwich was missing the au jus and the salad looked like it had been thrown together hastily. If the food had actually been high quality much would have been forgiven, but it was only mediocre - I've had much better food at Paradise Bakery.  When we asked to speak to the manager, he was defensive and said they had three birthday parties that they hadn't planned on.  Maybe they should require reservations for large parties rather than letting them drop in unannounced and ruin it for everyone else?  He offered us a free appetizer and glass of wine, which seemed strange after we had finished dinner.  When we suggested an adjustment to the bill might be more appropriate he walked away shaking his head like we were being unreasonable.  He finally came back and did adjust the bill grudgingly. Between incredibly slow service, mediocre food and a bad attitude that's three strikes and they're out."}
{"text":"I have been talking with The Watershed's management for a few months now. I have seen the building in every phase of renovation. Unfortunately, I was helping to plan a Celebration of Life for a dear friend with terminal brain cancer and the staff was aware I could be calling them at any time to set a date.  Tuesday morning, my friend passed away and I knew that we would need the inside as well as the outside. I have never seen a more dedicated group of people jump in to work night and day so the inside was as close to perfect as they could get it. I spent the last several days at The Watershed, setting up special items and placing candles and flowers. I had every person that I encountered go above and beyond to help me. The celebration occurred on Friday and things could not have been more perfect. The food, atmosphere, drinks, staff, and facility were just exactly what my friend would have wanted. I will be taking everyone I know to this restaurant. If I need to plan another event, I will be calling them. I hope the community gets behind this place and supports it as they perfect their service, food, and business."}
{"text":"View is great. Patio is really nice. Food is 3 stars, it's ok. Service is 1 star. Waited about 15 minutes just to get served. Brought my toast out after I finished my breakfast. Come in with low expectations and they will meet that for you. Shame on management. Could be terrific. But it's just blah."}
{"text":"Great food. Had the tamales. Great drinks and environment too. But really slow service"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here 3 times - once when it first opened for dinner, once for appetizers and drinks with some friends, and this last time for brunch. We love the view and the space. And... That's pretty much it.

This review is based on our last visit. We had just finished helping a friend move, and my husband was hungry. In hindsight, I should have driven us over to Snooze, but he wanted to sit outside by the lake. 

Once we were seated, a lady from another table walked over to a couple who were seated behind us. We could overhear the conversation and I almost wish I hadn't. Apparently the lady had been waiting for quite a bit of time and never received her food. The couple sent back their food because there was hair in the pancakes (gag!).

Despite this, we decided to stay. My husband ordered the Shed Head omelette. He said that it was dry and that the potatoes were too salty. I ordered the huevos rancheros. Once the entree came out, I realized that the server did not ask me how I wanted my eggs cooked or whether I wanted the red or green sauce. So I ended up with scrambled eggs (meh) and green sauce in my meal. It was a big dish - eggs, potatoes, green sauce, and lots of cheese.  Remember the salty potatoes? They were definitely in this dish, which rendered the meal inedible. It was just so salty! 

The final straw was when we received our receipt. My meal was supposed to be $8.99, but the receipt said $13.99. We asked the waiter and he took it back to be adjusted. However, I wonder if they got away with taking $5 from people who just didn't notice.

This space is amazing and the view is unbeatable. For now, we will only visit this place for drinks. The food just isn't good and the service is bad. Hopefully when this place closes for good, we'll be able to get a fun place in South Tempe. OHSO, The Vig, The Yard - come save us!"}
{"text":"The green chili cheese fries are so amazing and tasty margaritas! Sitting here viewing the lake is so nice and peaceful."}
{"text":"Love the mimosa! They have great mimosa bottle for $15 with OJ!! Great view and great patio on the lake and you are able to take a boat ride."}
{"text":"Made a reservation for 11pm, and when we got there (on time) they told us their kitchen was closed... Very poorly organized. Had to pay for a taxi there and back for absolutely no reason. Definitely won't bother to come here again."}
{"text":"We really liked the new menu. Many more choices.  Relaxed atmosphere   Great place to meet friends. Our waiter Len was attentive and provided great service."}
{"text":"5 star location & ambiance
3 star food..
The lake front view is one of a kind for the Phoenix area which makes this place so neat. Have been here multiple times, some of the food is very good (love the enchiladas) but the other dishes we've had have been good, not great."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere specifically outside by the lake. Average American food. Good selection of beers and spirits. Good for loud groups. Would not be the place I want to go with my family."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE SERVICE. Waiter was very rude and took over an hour with my food (even though I only ordered toast and eggs). They weren't even packed, yet my food came out cold and stale. I thought this would be a nice restaurant because of the great location, but I was wrong. Please, don't waste your money here. There are plenty of other restaurants around the area that have much better service and good quality food, unlike this poor excuse for a restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome location with a beautiful view, the service has gotten better over time and only continues to improve, this is a nice restaurant to go to with family, friends or on a date, I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I've tried three times, first time good, second  time average, third time horrible... They can't even get kids Mac n cheese right... Everything was slow, we arrived at 6pm, ordered at 6:30 and finally ate at 8:30.... I want this place to succeed, it won't, I live across the street and I won't be back.  They take forever, and then a little longer.  Save yourself the time and misery, eat somewhere else. We had to request silverware, request salt and pepper and then after several \"updates\" from our waiter the food finally came out dry, cold and bad.... I want to give a good review, I can't."}
{"text":"So I had been wanting to try this restaurant for years now. We finally made it on Sunday morning. I called before we went ,just to make sure they were open. 
When we first got there the place looked so run down, as if it has never been remodeled. There was only about 10 people there inside and out combined. The place is very large though. If it was nice, you could have a Wedding reception there or some other type of party. 
When we came in ,we were greeted by a nice girl at the receptionist desk. She showed us a bit of the place and asked if we would like to sit inside or outside. Since it was an amazingly cool day in the Valley, we wanted to sit outside. The whole point of this place is it is on the water. 
Even though it is a man made water way, it is still nice to sit and dine. You are limited on what you have to choose from here in the Phoenix Area.

Anyway, She sat us and gave us menu's. She said our server would be right with us. She also explained that we would fill out this piece of paper as to what type of omelet we wanted. Whilst walking to our table,she told us that they only served a buffet until 3:00pm , then they began dinner. The menu was pages of Alcohol. So I really think that they are pushing more to be a bar than a dining establishment. 
We got a nice table on the water, and filled out our omelet requests and then we waited. No one ever came. There were 2 other occupied tables outside and no one ever came to check on them either. They looked as if they had been there awhile.
We saw the hostess again, she came running out to help one of the tables already dining, maybe to get their check or something. She was nice enough to stop at our table as well. To check on us. We gave her the omelet papers and told her we had still not seen a server.
This poor girl seemed to be the only one paying attention to what was going on in the place.

We went up to get our food at the Buffet. What a mess!
 I know the chef making the waffles was very proud of it all but, have you ever been to another Buffet, another restaurant, a party!
Every thing was just thrown up on the tables. There was not even a resting dish for the serving spoons. So the spoons were inside the food containers. Scorching hot and full of germs from everyone's hands. The lids were half on some containers, not on others at all. Most of the food was really dried out. Either over heated, or over cooked. Everything was messy.

Some of the food items were quite good. Others I could not try! They just looked un edible. 
When we got back to the table we had 2 waters with lemons and straws. That was nice. However, that was it. No coffee and no salt and pepper or any other condiments. You also must collect your own Silverware whilst you are at the Buffet. A knife and fork wrapped in a cloth napkin. No spoons.  Our server Alexi(i think) did come over to ask if we wanted cocktails at 11:30am. I said no think you , but we would like 2 coffees, luckily I also added we needed cream. She brought them with 2 big Ice tea spoons, so maybe they do not have teaspoons here. I had to go looking for sugar and salt and pepper , and hot sauce. I luckily found them on a table inside.
Shortly after that a man brought out our Omelets and they were hot which was really nice.
We had to get ourselves refills on coffee,from the Buffet. I do not know why they even have a server.  The best part is ,IT IS $20.00 A PERSON FOR THIS BUFFET.  I never mind paying for a good meal but, this whole thing is crazy. 

I really wanted it to be good. I had been looking forward to going here for a long time. They could make a really nice place here. But, they have a lot to learn. The little blonde girl who was the hostess was literally running and helping other tables. I felt sorry for her she was doing so much, everyone else was just taking it easy. I even had to ask the hostess if we could get our bill as we never saw our server again. Till it was time to take the $$$. 
We sat with dirty dishes in front of us for 17 min. while the bus boy walked back and forth past our table. I said, we are through please. You can take these dishes. He said great, and brought the dirty bus pan over to us{ with dirty dishes in it} So we could put the dishes in it.
Atrocious! Sorry to say, we will not be back. We might try the little place next door. But, The Watershed is not worth your time or money.   Apparently this place has changed hands many times.This is a fairly new owner as well."}
{"text":"Started off well. Amazing view of a private lake. Good margarita, though pretty small. Their Sun Devil chili is excellent as well as their broccoli cheddar soup, though both were a tad salty. These are why they got a second star.

Everything went downhill from there. The grilled Mahi Mahi sandwich was dry and tasteless, as well as being dinky for the price. Completely inedible! When I complained, the waitress did offer to replace it, but when we explained we didn't have time to wait for a new entrée, she made no offer to refund us on that aspect of the order. The manager never came to our table to express concern or offer to comp us the entrée. 

Bottom line? It's an inferior-quality sports bar with a killer view. We will NOT be back!"}
{"text":"This place is all about location. The lake view and outdoor area are very nice and relaxing. They also have some nice lounging areas inside and the decor is overall cozy. 

The food however is nothing to talk about. I have visited twice, the first I got the cobb salad which tasted like one I would get at any regular ol fast food place. The second I was there for brunch and i got the BYO omelette with chorizo and avocado. This meal includes potatoes but they were so dry i only had a few. The omelette also didn't taste like anything, indicating bad chorizo which is usually very flavorful. I really dont recommend it for the food but if you want a place for drinks and a nice view thats probably not bad."}
{"text":"This place is a beautiful gem... Great service.. Awesome food and yummy happy hour goodies.. It's our first time here but it won't be our last."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Tempe.  My boyfriend and I went there for the first time tonight... Beautiful waterfront views! Wonderful live music!!! The food was awesome!!! Authentic southwestern/new Mexican food.  We had the green chile cheese fries they were amazing and the watershed nachos!! Our server was friendly, knowledgable, and attentive. We had a great time and will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Watershed is a hidden gem! Fell in love with the place the second we were seated on the patio. Staff is beyond friendly. Food is phenomenal! The prices can't be beat. Such a great happy hour and brunch. :) $5 Bloody Mary's are unheard of in the area and they're delicious! I personally like their jalapeño infused vodka mix. We will definitely be returning again and again. This is paradise at home. We love the Watershed!!!"}
{"text":"The service here is great!! Food was wonderful also. Our server was very friendly and helpful to us. Ask about the boat ride! It cost 5$ a person and the driver will tell you all about the houses along the lake and take you on the most beautiful boat ride. We went at night in the winter and they even gave us some blankets to keep warm. Beautiful place with very friendly staff."}
{"text":"A friend told me about his place because of the pretty view.  I will give it that as you are right on the lake but that's all that was good.  We have friends from out of state and wanted to give them a nice AZ experience on the waters edge.  My fiancée and I got there first as we wanted to try the happy hour menu.  The sangrias and frozen drinks were highlighted on the happy hour menu.  I ordered sangria, the waiter came about 10 minutes later and said they were out.  How can they be out, its 5pm on a Friday?  So then I asked for a frozen drink, guess what.....out of that also.  Being frustrated at this place, I asked him to tell me what else they didn't have and he assured me that everything else they had. The waiter could tell we were upset that the two main drink specials, they didn't have.  He said he felt bad and would bring us some chips and salsa.  He walked around for another 15 minutes or so and didn't bring anything during that timeframe.  Then our friends from MN show up and we warn them that the waiter is new and they don't have the drinks that we wanted.  Sure enough, my friend ordered a beer that they said they had (MGL) AND guess what, they are out!  So we read about the pretzel rolls being good so we order those and calamari for starters.  NO exaggeration, it was over 1 hour and they still hadn't brought them.  We asked several times, the waiter said he kept asking the cooks but still a no show.  We asked to talk to the manager.  The waiter said he already asked the manager several time to come to our table, he NEVER showed.  So then we ask for chicken wings... Guess what, they are out.  We were so hungry by then we just told them to cancel our starters as it had been over an hour.  We did order dinner which was fair and did come in a fairly timely manner.  I could see maybe if they were busy, but on a Friday night, only about 1/4 full and we think we learned why.  The waiter said he asked the manager at least 5 times to come to our table as he also thought what we went through was unacceptable.  We ended up being there for about 2 1/2 hours and only ended up with some drinks and the supper but no starters that we waited an hour for that never showed.  Please, do NOT take your out of town guest here and we also will NEVER go back.  I have no idea how they stay in business!  Beautiful location ruined by a terrible experience......"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here! LOVE IT! But the food is not good. I've had several items and they have all been OK to terrible. So I stick to the drinks and the atmosphere and hope that they get a new menu and chef."}
{"text":"Went here for my first father's day brunch as a new dad. Not a good experience. Out of almost every drink we wanted to order. Menu did not reflect summer beer changes. They were out of fish and chips. Did not give crayons with kids menu. The servers are made to order in little iPods and it is time consuming and slow. Everything is overpriced. Only good thing was the server, who was very attentive and helpful. The food is very expensive and extremely bland. I ordered the prime rib sandwich. The fries on everyone's plate were cold. My sandwich was Luke warm and not very appetizing. The Au Jus was with out a doubt the most bland and nasty I have every had. Not worth the $15 I paid for it. Would not come back here."}
{"text":"While the view at The Watershed is lovely, sadly my experience was not. We came on a Tuesday night and the restaurant was pretty empty, yet there was no one to seat us, no one to take our order, and we waited awhile for our food and checks. 

My friend and I both ordered glasses of wine - she ordered a 9 ounce glass and I ordered a six. However, when our glasses came the pours were the exact same. We're still not sure if we got six or nine ounce pours. 

I had the Southwest Salad and it was average at best. The dressing was described on the menu as a cilantro lime vinaigrette but it was really just a cup of olive oil. 

Our waitress was always nowhere to be found, which is surprising considering there was maybe two or three other tables in the restaurant. 

The bathrooms had an off putting smell and there was no trash can so all of the paper towels were being piled up by the sink. 

They do have an extensive cocktail list, so in the future we may just come to enjoy the view and sip on a drink."}
{"text":"We had our baby shower @ the Watershed in Sept. The facilities are quite nice & the menu options are surprisingly impressive! Our event coordinator Sharmayne was amazing!! She answered all of our questions and made the entire process/production go as smoothly as possible. We'll certainly think of hosting other parties/functions there in the future. Just a very cool spot with the lake and all..."}
{"text":"Gorgeous patio, great food, SUPER slow service! It's like this EVERY time I come here, but I keep coming back because the location is so great. (Sigh)"}
{"text":"It was our first time at this restaurant that was supposedly great. My husband and I booked a reservation ahead of time online for water-front seating, and when we got there they told us even despite our reservation they had no seating outside for us. This was the whole reason I wanted to come. So we sat at a table with a window instead. Then, next comes out less-than-friendly waiter who they informs out that they were out of drink menus to hand out. So I asked \"what kinds of white wine do you have?\" and the waiter had no idea. He just stood there. So then my husband says \"is it on the website?\" And then we had to search through their less-than-user friendly website on our phones to find a drink. He took about 15 Minutes to come see us again and when he did he said \"how are you guys doing?\"  Well, would have been doing fine had he taken our drink order. Then it took another 10-15 minutes to get our drinks (my white wine was warm BTW but chose not to send it back since I'd have to wait another 10 mins).  The food? It was just OK."}
{"text":"Can't beat the view! I also can't believe I've lived here all my life and didn't know this place existed. Very friendly service and really good drinks. I'll have to go back and taste the other food because I only had fish & chips and you can't go wrong with that."}
{"text":"This waterfront restaurant is the best experience I've had in tempe. It has great beers, great food, friendly waiters and a fun boat ride to enjoy on this beautiful lake. You cannot miss out on this."}
{"text":"Gorgeous view, poor service, decent food. 

We planned ahead for a large group and let the Watershed know however they still seemed to be very understaffed for us. Our server was friendly and the place was not busy besides our party however he was our server and what seemed to be the bartender as well which meant everything took 3x as long. My friend ordered a burger medium with fries and it took over 30 minutes, came with chips, the girl who dropped it off said she would be back with fries but never did. Another member of our table ordered the chips, guacamole, and queso. It came out as just chips and salsa...then eventually the queso...not sure if they ever received the quac.

Since I noticed everything was taking forever I opted for the buffet. The man working over there was extremely friendly and mentioned the buffet was new. The flow was extremely awkward and it would of been nice to have signs that said what everything was.

The only good item on the buffet was the enchiladas, they were AMAZING. That should be put on the menu full time. 

Once the other guests received their food everything was delicious. 

I could understand if we should up unannounced with that large of group and the staff being overwhelmed however many people we were with mentioned that the service is always that slow and unorganized.

I would only come back for the view and a cocktail."}
{"text":"This is a little gem tucked away in an established Tempe neighborhood that you'd never expect to be there. I've driven by a few times and saw lots of cars parked outside, but thought it was a private club. When a friend asked me to meet her there for happy hour, I jumped at the chance. 

It's a gorgeous setting on the lake. We sat on the patio and watched the sun set while enjoying a glass of wine. (all wine & craft beer 50% ALL day on Monday!) You'll see a few neighborhood boaters wave as they float by on their little electric boats. If you want to join them, there's a boat ride that's only $5, that you pay for inside. 

We both had salads that were delicious and fresh. They don't skimp on any of the goodies either (candied pecans..yum!). The service was prompt and courteous. There was a mix of older & younger generations. All seemed welcome and treated equally. Very nice place, and I definitely plan to go many more times, since it's less than 5 min from home!"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time reviewing this place.  I won't go into all the details of the establishment, but really just focus on 1 of the employees.  I have been a regular at this place since it reopened quite a few years back, so I have seen and interacted with this man quite a few times.  I feel my opinion of him at this point is rather just.  

There is one shaggy haired bartender who has been there since the place opened.  He has never been particularly good.  He is rather slow at making drinks, so when it's even slightly busy, drinks take an exceptionally long time.  He also has absolutely zero sense of urgency.  He always moves at the same lethargic pace, which is at about a 3 out of 10, and that's being generous.   

He is also rather unpleasant to look at.  His clothes are more than often unkempt, and his hair and facial hair don't add any sense of cleanliness to his overall appearance.  I certainly don't need supermodel bartenders, but I don't like feeling like my drinks are dirty either.  

To top off this gem of a worker, he routinely has one of the least pleasant attitudes of anybody I encounter.  He has personally given me nasty and snide comments on a consistent basis.  Doing it even once I would consider unacceptable but it happens more often than not when he is working.  His poor attitude is not only just in his choice of words, but is also conveyed through his body language and his propensity to completely ignore patrons who are at the bar.  Most of my friends, male and female, who have dealt with him have shared similar sentiments.  

I'm disgusted and turned off when I walk in and notice he is working, and I can say that he is one of the reasons I don't go to the Watershed more often.  

I look forward to the day when he no longer works there"}
{"text":"Terrible service, cold food, nice view. 
We were eager to try this place out. We can early on a Saturday night (5:30pm). Our waiter was no where to be seen throughout our entire visit. We placed our order and sat with empty glasses for 30 minutes before we were checked on. Once our food was delivered by someone else, our server never checked on us until we were done. I would have liked Ketchup with my fries and salt. I also would have liked a refill on my drink during my meal. I ordered the fish and chips. They were cold.  
We will not return."}
{"text":"My wife and I went in on Saturday to enjoy the weather and sit out and have a drink overlooking the water. Pretty hard to enjoy your time when you are being ignored by the entire waitstaff. After sitting for close to 10 minutes with no service, I walked up to one of the servers who was serving on the patio and asked if we could get drinks from her. She replied to me \"Did the hostess seat you?\" I told her no and that there was no one at the host stand when we walked in. We saw a high bar top open on the patio and grabbed it. The waitress then told me that if we wanted drinks or food, the bar could help us out. Pretty annoying, but we still decided to just go up to the bar and take our drinks outside. While drinking our beers, there were about 5/6 tables that had yet to be bussed and stayed like that for about 35/40 mins. There was another woman who came in and sat down at a table outside, and it was clear the waitress was avoiding her as well. About 10 minutes later the woman got the waitresses attention, she asked if she could order something. The waitress again asked her if she had been seated by the hostess and when the woman said no, the waitress replied \"well since you weren't sat, let me check and make sure this table isn't reserved.\" At this time, the entire patio was empty other than a few tables, and all the others had dirty glasses and dishes all over them. The woman then got up and told the waitress \"nevermind, I'll go somehwere else\" and she left the restaurant. We then overheard the waitress talking to one of the tables and explaining to them that it was time for her break so someone else was going to be taking over serving them. It is clear that the waitress was more interested in going on break than taking care of the customers. 

I worked in the industry for years and would never treat guests that way. I understand that you have breaks and all that, but at least take the order and then transfer them to the next server. The other woman just got up and left and in retrospect, that's what we should have done as well. I have now been to The Watershed about 10 times and have never really had good service. I keep giving it another chance because it is such a great location and beautiful building, but I believe that after this experience I will never return."}
{"text":"Honestly, I have no pros for the Watershed, only cons.  I booked my reservation for the Watershed online via Yelp for a party of 14 for my Meet Up Group's \"White Elephant Brunch\" a whole month before the date.  Pictures on the website looks so enticing.  It looks like it would be a lot of fun.  Would be! The date was Sunday, December 17th, 2017.  Someone from the Watershed called to confirm the reservation on Thursday, December 14th, 2017.  They asked what our final count, if we wanted to be inside or outside, and confirmed the time (11:30am).  I said Yes!  We're super excited ... see you guys Sunday.

Sunday morning, about 10:15am, someone from the Watershed called me back again to confirm my reservation for the second time.  She again asked if we wanted to be seated inside or outside.  I arrived at 11:30 on the dot.  The hostess said there's 2 members of your party waiting over there.  We're getting your table together. I said ... Oh ok!  Will it take a long time because you guys called to confirm everything with me twice.  The hostess said, just a few moments.  A few moments turned into us not being seated until after 12:00, about 12:10.  There was absolutely no sense of urgency to accommodate my party.  The hostess told us we'd be seated in the Captains Circle (or something like that).  We were told to stand in that area until the hostess pushed tabled together (by herself).  

Once we were seated, we received menus immediately.  We all ordered waters and mimosas to start.  We received our mimosas, our waters didn't hit the table until 12:30 Guys!!!  12:30. 
I can't remember the name of our server, but perhaps she should have had someone help her with our party of 14.  While taking everyone's orders, we also took everyone's name.  It appears she took everyone's orders correctly.  Everyone's food started coming out, everyone except for 3 people.  A different server told us the missing plates were on their way.  Minutes passed, nothing.  We flagged down our initial server and asked about the few missing plates.  She admitted that she completely forgot to put their orders in.  How?!  You took everyone's order by name.  How?!  

Again, there was no sense of urgency at all to accommodate us.  My section wasn't ready.  We received water 30 mins after being seated.  Out of 14, only 11 of us received our dishes in a timely manner.  Because of this I will not visit the Watershed again.  Ever again!"}
{"text":"We found this treasure on the water through a coupon in a magazine. We started going and have been there several times and brought friends with us a few times. Everyone has enjoyed the view and the food.Nice music and a very pleasant atmosphere. It is quite a long drive for us from Fountain Hills but we love going there."}
{"text":"I really really want to like this place, but.... I can't. The location is perfect! What a beautiful view of the lake and Christmas Island. However, the food just plain sucks and so does the wait staff. The food feels like it was boiled in a bag and thrown on a plate. Then the waiters first you're even there. You just wait... and wait... and wait just to put an order in for a drink. I've been here a few times just because I want to believe and hope this place would improve, but disappointing every time."}
{"text":"It has now been 3 weeks since I have been to this place. It took one week for a manager to even contact me after all of the hostesses did not give him the information to contact me. The manager assured me a great second chance which I have not received. I have tried contacting the manager 3 times since and have never heard back from him. All of the staff I have spoke to has told me they will tell him to contact me, yet 3 weeks have gone by with no contact. It's sad to see a business not treat their customers the way they should be treated. It's sad to see a manager not take pride in a restaurant and reach out to the customers who are trying to point out the flaws so that they can become better. Instead of taking it as a learning experience they choose to ignore it and pretend they are doing a good job. Disappointed to say the least. 

Initial review: This unfortunately was the worst experience I've had in a long time. I took my bf here on a surprise anniversary date and I left EMBARRASSED AND DISAPPOINTED beyond what I imagined. When I have come before it was great but now I won't ever recommend it to anyone. When I called to make my reservation I asked to have the couches outside and she said yes. When I got there they put us on the opposite side of the restaurant to where we can't even see the lake. When I asked if we could move she said we were full. Our waitress took over 10 minutes just to bring us water after that. Then we finally ordered and it seemed like forever until we got our food. My order asked for no tomatoes which I didn't think was that hard to ask for, but guess what they put, tomatoes and I'm allergic. So picking around it was a haste and my bf burger was so spicy he had to pick off everything on it just to finish it. She didn't come over to ask if we needed anything during and he was without water with his spicy burger. While I was eating my meal my chicken was ice cold while my chips were hot and it was literally disgusting. While Emily checked on every other table around us, she only came to us twice during or meal while she went to everyone else about 5 times. When we left I wrote a note to send to the manager and expected a call. I was absolutely embarrassed to haven picked a place that I thought would be a nice surprise. If there could be less than one star I would choose it and if you decide to come here just prepare for bad service all around. Honestly choose somepl"}
{"text":"So sorry to hear, from online reviews and comments from friends who've been here recently, that the service and food have still not improved.  I've been hoping for years for this restaurant to improve it's ambiance and quality of food.  Sure I'd like good service as well, but I'd settle for good food and a nicer atmosphere because it's both unique and pleasing to not only dine outdoors, but also on the water."}
{"text":"First time here, heard good things so we were excited.

Was told it would be about a 30 minute wait, which was totally fine, but we couldn't help but notice there were a few empty tables. We figured maybe they were reserved or something. After 40 minutes, the hostess approached us and asked if we wanted inside or outside. We said first available, and she proceeded to seat us at one of he empty tables we'd been staring at for 40 minutes. So make sure you specify, I guess.

We put our order in right away along with the soft pretzel as an appetizer, and it took 30 minutes for the pretzel to come out, which definitely had us a bit irritated. But our waiter was nice and apologized and comp'ed the pretzel, and our entrees came out shortly after. 

I got the ahi tuna salad, which was a tad overpriced for the mix you're getting, but the dressing was AMAZING. My boyfriend got a the tri tip sandwich and liked it a lot, and the fries were pretty great. 

Overall, we want to come back because we live in the neighborhood. I think they might be a bit understaffed, and it was a relatively busy night."}
{"text":"Great view overlooking the lake.  Slow service, fairly nasty food, no silverware.  Overpriced drinks. Wait staff could not care less.   Party of 11 , won't be back.  Manager came out when I asked for a manager to tell us they were out of pasta and the kids needed to order something different.  Got fries and a burger 20 minutes later.  Next time old get better service better food and lower prices at McDonalds.  Really Great Lake view, inexcusable food and service.  Bye Felicia."}
{"text":"The ambiance is great, nothing like sitting on an outdoor patio in spring, overlooking water.
Sadly, that is where it ends tho. The service was extremely slow, she was nice, but seemed extremely flustered and slow on everything. The food is below average, everything seemed to be out of a can, I could have made better nachos myself at home, heck Taco Bell has better nachos. 
I would only return to have some cocktails overlooking the water, I do not think I would ever eat there again."}
{"text":"Food was great and Ken the waiter was very knowledgeable and courteous.  A nice evening."}
{"text":"Had a great time at this place.  A group of friends and I had a party and they took good care of us.  The service was great, food was delicious, and the everyone was so friendly and did an awesome job."}
{"text":"WORTH THE READ.....when I say worth the read I mean it will save you 20.00 per person!! If I didn't have a Groupon for the Saturday/Sunday brunch I wouldn't have come based off of recent reviews. Unfortunately I bought this Groupon when they still offered the brunch menu only to come in and see they have recently changed to a \"buffet\". This might be a new thing they are trying and perhaps they need more data to determine it's worth so this needs to count as a solid negative for brunch buffet. We came in at 12:30, most of the food was gone and what was available was either burned or not a brunch food (salmon, chicken alfredo, lasagna)  we saw tables near ours with menu items so we asked and were told they had an appetizer coupon and menu items are not a part of the buffet which is all that is offered right now 
We did give our feedback to the server in a respectful manner but who knows if it will make a difference because we were told the array of crappy options is to please people on a larger scale...I have yet to read a review on how amazing any of the brunch options are so that should say a lot in itself.  Our suggestion is to have a smaller menu of options and include one drink. 
Note: this is not your normal buffet where you peruse the options and serve yourself, it is more you like you're at a hotel buffet or work conference meal. Food was horrible, options were horrible and we will not be back which sucks cause there is potential but I'm not willing to waste more money."}
{"text":"Pssst...This place is an amazing date night, reception, retirment party, etc. place. It is locate right on the lake and has a really nice patio with picnic tables on the grass and regular tables on the dock. Inside is spacious and open and has great views as well. Service was fantastic, our waters stayed filled, our drinks from the bar were quick and our food was well timed. 

The imporant part, the food: YUM! We started with coconut shrip with mango habanero sauce. really good! Then the skilled queso con chorizo, another hit! Finally we shared the fish tacos. Again really good. Nothing dissapointed. For drinks, they have $10 speciatly cocktails. I started with a edelberry flower, spinach, lemon drop martini. It was soooooo good and refreshing. Great flavor combinations. They have a large selection of craft beers on tap as well, I noticed some Oskar Blue and I had an Oak Creek nut brown ale.  

This really is a perfect spot for occasions as well as just wanting to enjoy a peacful, good meal with a beautiful view. So glad I found this place! It does sound like from some of the other reviews that they had a rough opening but they seem to have worked it all out. Service was fantastic, place looks beautiful and all the food was really good. The atmosphere makes food that is a solid 4 stars 5 stars easy."}
{"text":"8 pm. Couldn't even get seated because the kitchen closes at \"8:45\" but the restaurant is open until 11 pm? Worst first time customer service experience. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Watershed was great. Went in on a Sunday afternoon. Food was delicious. they have boat rides and just do peaceful to enjoy a yummy lunch."}
{"text":"Great service by Stephanie! The nachos are amazing as are the views. Great vibes. We come here often and always have a great time."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and staff. They were short staffed on a Wednesday night. We had a few hiccups but nothing major. We are excited to try it again for Happy Hour with a bigger group of friends. The one thing we did not like was the chicken on the nachos, seasoning tasted like curry?!?! We will be back."}
{"text":"Location, location, location. Then there is really good drinks like nowhere else. Service is fantastic. If your lucky the Manager may even pull a magic trick. 

Try their infused Bloody Mary's and Margaritas."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE The Watershed!  I've hosted 4 private events at this venue, both in their private Captain's Lounge room and out on the deck. The staff are always helpful & friendly, my guests have all enjoyed themselves and thanked me for choosing such a cool spot for our events! 
The chef is flexible and will make vegan & gluten free entrees by request and their bar is so cool!! Great environment and great people, I'll definitely go back many more times."}
{"text":"The fish & chip was fabulous & fresh along with the ginger margarita!! I will be back"}
{"text":"Love the view. Food was good too. Taking the free boat ride after brunch! We'll definitely come back. Maybe for the brewga"}
{"text":"The Watershed was a pleasant surprise in the desert. Easy to get to plenty of parking nice open area on a Lake man-made. The service was spectacular and the food was very good. We enjoyed the fish and chips which was plentiful and done to perfection. We also enjoyed the shredded beef nachos as an appetizer and enjoyed those with a couple of adult beverages of our choice. The waiter let the boat captain know that we were interested in a ride that came with our Groupon. The captain came over and introduced himself to us and checked to see how our meal was and when we might be ready to go for the 15 minute ride. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable from start to finish greeting to check payment. We will return and probably bring others to enjoy the Captain's Quarters and game area."}
{"text":"The Watershed is absolutely beautiful. But when I arrived I couldn't tell if the place was even open. Personally, my food and drinks were great. But my party of 8 had lots of problems with their food, drinks, and inaccurate bills. I'm on the fence in terms of how I feel about this place but I will be trying it for a second time very soon so we shall see."}
{"text":"The scenery alone makes it worth visiting.  Right on the lake, with plenty of surrounding greenery. And as a plus, the food and service is very good. My family and I found this place right here on Yelp. We were looking for dining options near the lake as a remembrance to my Dad who passed away a year ago. Our server, Ray, was very accommodating. We had concerns about nut allergies which he confirmed with the chef. I love red wine and he suggested the Dark Velvet Merlot which was full and flavorful with hints of blackberries just how I like it.  The salmon club wrap was fresh and satisfying. And the Grasshopper Pie!...superb! I definitely will be back. My only suggestion would be to add dinner music and have someone on site for boat rentals."}
{"text":"Great Patio, HORRIBLE HORRIBLE service, EVERY TIME! This place is screaming for proper management and qualified servers!   Good Grief people!"}
{"text":"My family went to the Watershed tonight for a birthday party.  I had read about the place but we had never visited it before.  Driving it felt like we had left Az and were in the mountains or at the beach.  the building is large, open and comfortable with a great view. The beer selection is pretty solid with a lot of choices (the O'dell's Red IPA is great).  We had shrimp, calamari and pretzel bite appetizers and all were good.

I had the grilled chees with ham, which I split with my son.  My wife had the Albaturkey sandwich with sweet potato fries and my daughter a curry pasta dish.  Everyone enjoyed the food and I saw people passing around salmon and other entrees.  

Give the place a try, good food, and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wonderful atmosphere and location! We experienced quality food paired with friendly service."}
{"text":"Well I've been to this place once and it was over a year ago. The place was very buys and the service was ok. I loved the atmosphere and they had Karaoke that night also. However my one question is this... Why does the Owner not reply to the bad reviews? This is their chance to answer the questions why only respond to good reviews? That worries me.


** Had to update the review** I called The Watershed just now to check and see if they were going to be playing the game tonight, and the person who answered the phone was very professional and helpful. I love when people have great customer service skills over the phone. Thats a huge plus... now let's hope that service is the same in person."}
{"text":"Great Sunday afternoon treat! Nice way to end the weekend as the sun was setting durring our boat ride.  Best clam chowder I've ever had, no lies! The clams were not chewy like most places!  Oh, and the red sangria... a MUST!"}
{"text":"I do not do anything to be spiteful. Prior to coming here this evening 9/27/17 I had read the reviews on Facebook & Yelp! Based off that I was nervous about coming but wanted to support the fundraiser event. I really wished I had went with my gut instinct because eight now my tummy would not be hurting. We sat at a table with 2 other families we knew. It took over an hour for 1 party's food to come out it also took 2 waitress's to get some mayo. The other party's burger was cold and they forgot to put bacon on it. $12 for chicken nachos the chicken wasn't even seasoned. The kitchen was slow getting the food out I felt bad for the waitress she just kept apologizing. We had 2 kids at the table we got kids menus after we had ordered for them off the regular menu which we had to ask for because they only gave us the limited menu. I will not come back, they have spider webs by the fountain and by where our table was. The view was pretty it has the potential to be a nice place but they really need to read the negative comments and fix those problems. They ruined a lot of people's mother's day. I regret going it was a waste of my money."}
{"text":"So I took my mother here for Mother's Day with a reservation, needless to say we stopped at Wendy's afterwards. 

So we came in before our reservation time and the hostess told us where we were supposed to be and I asked if there was any chance we could be outside on the patio we would wait longer she said \"I'll see what I can do\". So we go to the bar and get drinks while we wait and table is ready before the drinks are but she says I wasn't able to get you outside. This is where I start to get pissed, there's 10+ tables out there that are empty and stayed empty our whole visit. We looked at the menu online and figured out what we wanted beforehand but found out that they had only a selected menu that was 8 different items all at least $20 except desserts. I begrudgingly ordered the grilled salmon, BIG MISTAKE! So it came out super fast and I was thinking this looks tiny(didn't say how big the portion was on the menu) I thought it was a fillet of fish but it was fillet mingon size. I'm like I can't believe I paid $22 for this tiny fish at least at other restaurants that charge that have better service. I cut it open and ITS RAW INSIDE! I sit there for 10 minutes before my server comes and asks how I like it. I nicely asked can it be cooked more and she says oh yes I'm sorry and takes it back. By the time it comes back my mom has finished her food (which she says was okay) but I have to use her silverware since my new fish has none and the waitress ran off again. I paid the check and left. On my way out I was tempted to say to the hostess, \"who do I have to screw to get a table outside?\" 

I feel that since we didn't wear our super expensive clothes that we didn't get outside since it was obvious that all the customers out there were wealthy. 

I would only recommend this place for drinks because the bartender was great."}
{"text":"Great views, great service, and great view. Ordered some mimosas and tamales and it totally made my Easter! I would come back any time"}
{"text":"Slow or no service every time I go here and give it another shot.  This past time I was told I would be comped my drink for my wait but when the drink was brought to the table the manager asked me whether or not I planned to pay for the drink, leaving me feeling very uncomfortable.  I said no as I had told him earlier I didn't want the drink and wanted to leave.  When I told the manager I didn't plan on paying for the drink since he said it was comped he took it back when he saw we didn't plan on spending more money at the establishment.  Very uncomfortable experience to start the morning."}
{"text":"Great drinks, good bar food and excellent service! Next time we need to have dinner a little later when the sun is setting so we can enjoy the beautiful deck overlooking the water."}
{"text":"I have a love hate relationship with this place. They do a lot of things right, but there are little things that seem to happen frequently.  I should start by saying this location has been horrible for a lot of restaurants. They try really hard, but I think there is a disconnect with the person who has a vision for the restaurant and the person who is implementing these ideas. To be fair, they have improved leaps and bounds since they first open. And I should say I really want this place to succeed. 
That being said if they just had consistent, decent food and drinks I would consider it a success."}
{"text":"Totally underwhelmed by our first visit here. Slightly embarrassed as we took friends visiting from out of state here. Food was fair. I was afraid it would be cold for as long as it took to get it. They were not that busy for the wait we had with server to get us the bill. We were actually ready to get up an go find him. I guess we were anticipating more since they have been open for awhile to get kinks out. Looks like construction is still going on. I will be hesitant to return."}
{"text":"Every Thursday night my girlfriends and I enjoy dinner and drinks at a local Tempe restaurant. Our visit to The Watershed fell short of our expectations tenfold. The waiter was exceptionally slow, it took 25 minutes to get a glass of wine and the appetizer came out with the food. The food was sub-par and lukewarm. I came into the restaurant from the patio on two different occasions to ask for items for our table. When the food runner delivered ketchup- I asked for more and she replied \"is that not enough for you?\" The lack of respect and service is beyond disappointing for a $35/per person restaurant. 

It's no surprise this place has only 3 stars. The view is pretty but atrocious service is not worth any amount of ambiance."}
{"text":"This had to be the worst experience ever for a restaurant I have gone to. First of all I went with a group of nine people for brunch. The waiter Alexander was extremely slow and didn't seem like he knew what he was doing. He took our orders and kept forgetting to bring things to us when our order came. Three of us refused their food because it was cold or the wrong order. Mine tasted good but it was cold even though it was on a second plate that was hot. Most likely to keep it warm. My  coffee was cold and I never was served water. One lady who was a vegetarian got meat on her omelette. Another lady had just sent her order back because it was the wrong order. Another lady said her food was so cold that she refused to eat it. The bill for certain ones came up incorrect. And when I gave him my credit card to pay for my bill and he came back with it he didn't know whose credit card was whose and there was only one. When I went to the restroom it was so disgusting and had never been cleaned from the night before. There was pubic hair and toilet paper remains that were sitting all over the back of the toilet. The waiter constanly made excuses about him serving 6 tables but the place was basically empty. I would not ever recommend anybody eating at this establishment simple because of the poor service, the filthy toilets and have a scatterbrain way of cooking the food.
Came back again just to see what everyone was saying about the best time to go was happy hour. Went on a Wednesday and sat at the bar. I ordered drinks which were pretty good and strong. Also ordered a appetizer which ended up getting mixed up and was sent to another table. A hour later I finally got my appetizer. He comped me 10% for the wait. This place just can't get their act together."}
{"text":"As long as you are not hungry or thirsty this place is great. Beautiful setting, inviting building and wonderful, large, lighted deck on the water.  Unfortunately they were unable to accommodate people with the establishment close to full. There were only 3 or so wait staff for the large restaurant, and it would take 30 minutes to get our first beer.  The lake-tasting water served reminded us of what you got in the Valley 15 years ago--so glad most establishments use RO water now!  Good luck getting bottled water, we had to ask three times.  

We arrived at 6:30 for a 6:45 reservation but were not served our meal until almost 9.  The meal was not as ordered--a flour tortilla for our celiac suffering friend when should have been corn.  Also, it seemed they forgot to add water when cooking the rice. Not to worry, they comped our meal and offered free drinks.  We declined the drinks to get home to relieve the sitter--and two of the four would go home hungry.  Our meat loaf was good once we gathered the courage to eat it (they had lost our trust in so many ways that we were nervous). 

Perhaps if they hired more people they could charge full price and actually afford propane for their beautiful patio (it is currently $35 per hour for private parties only).  We were told to try them again--they were coming out with a new menu.  As our friend quipped--the menu is one of the few things they shouldn't change.  The delivery is what is lacking."}
{"text":"I'm really liking the Watershed as a place to enjoy Arizona's awesome outdoors and some tasty beverages. It's a place you visit for the ambiance. Good beer selection on menu though they were out of my preferred beer last time. Had a mule, and it was really nice to sip and enjoy by the lake. I wish they had a bigger menu -- for a place their size, it would be nice to have more options. Great place to bring friends for a relaxing happy hour at the end of the week. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday afternoon.  Our server was great and the happy hour goes until 7! The only downside (and it was a big downside) was that the food we pretty terrible.  We had a huge group that ordered some of everything and the best comment on the food was, \"meh.\"  Go for drinks and great atmosphere and then go somewhere for dinner after."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a great Friday evening with a buddy here & listened to a guitar player who took requests.  Just about every seat has a good view of the lake. The patio books fast & we landed a window table with a view. 
Happy Hour is from 3-6 Mon through Fri.  We had good quality wines for $5 & good chicken tacos & chicken flatbread for $5. This place has better happy hour foods compared to other restaurants. 
Our server, Janice, was very professional & provided great suggestions.  Also, she let us know about the boat tours. She was attentive without being intrusive which is a rare quality. 
BTW, boat tours are $5 per person. 
Parking can be a challenge but don't be discouraged since a parking area next door is available. 
With the great wine prices you might want to Uber or Lyft here. 
Two thumbs up for the Watershed."}
{"text":"The Watershed is a great place. Whether it's for a drink with some friends to watch a game in the bar, a nice glass of wine on the lakeshore or a romantic dinner at sunset, this is the place.
The staff are all very friendly and the manager Heather is always there making sure things run smoothly.
Great happy hour place and prices.
If you're looking for a cool lakeside spot in Tempe, this is it!"}
{"text":"Arrived for a birthday party/date night with my wife and 9 month old son. We don't get out very often because of the baby but we were really looking forward to this place.

Received water after 40 minutes (we were playing a game to see how long it would take). Came back to take our order but we were 10 minutes from leaving. We sat at this establishment for 1 hour 50 minutes and only once did our waiter look our way when we got up to leave. We gave up trying after the first hour. It's not worth my time to flag someone down to beg them to take my money. Crazy. Realize they were busy but my wife and I just gave up and promised to spread the word about this place.

Our other friends decided to stay and they did order. It took them an additional 70 minutes to receive their order. What kind of place is this?

I truly hope the owner will reach out to us. We left our party with two glasses of empty water $and no food and no bar tab. We went down the street and spent out $91 elsewhere and $31 for bar tab. I guess my $120 just wasn't good enough that night for attention. Sad part is we saw the website ahead of time and were tempted to book a large party of our own coming up shortly which I imagine would've brought in at least $800$900 in revenue with our group of 22.

Nice job guys.Thanks for a great experience on our one night out in the last 4 months. 

Owner's thoughts?"}
{"text":"Great place, right by the water. Nice for a romantic get together. Love the waterfront view, good drinks and great food."}
{"text":"We came here in a large group for a friends birthday. 

I understand on a Friday night, in a large group service won't be the best, but this was just bad. The server we had was very nice and seemed to be running a lot but there seemed to be a lot of wait staff just standing around. 

After asking different servers over 5 times for napkins and silverware over the course of 30min i went inside to get some. I also asked about a friends meal that hadn't yet arrived. They order over 40min before and were last to their meal, a chicken wrap. When i asked why the guy i spoke to said well its Friday night.

The bar was half empty there was another large party but other than that it was fairly empty. 

The food was ok, the beer was fine. But I wouldn't recommend and won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place is a welcome difference to the monotony of normal restaurants in Tempe. Sitting on the patio with the lake, drinking some cocktails with the friends and eating some delicious wings just feels nice! It's quiet enough for a nice date, but also a place to get a tad rowdy with your friends on the deck and enjoy some laughs... check it out!"}
{"text":"On Sunday the hostess told us we had a choice between the buffet and ordering off the menu. However, our server, after being seated for quite a while, told us we could ONLY  choose the buffet. We should have left then but we didn't.  The service was slow and sporadic.  I ordered  coffee, first the coffee came out, then the Splenda, then the cream....all punctuated by long (all least 15 minutes) waits despite it being relatively empty. A Coke was no better, nor the iced tea. Then to the food......half of it was cold, the other part inedible.  There were scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, french toast strips, plus a variety of pastas, pork, Mexican dishes, etc....all either cold, congealed or inedible.
Obviously, they are in search of the bar business and the food was secondary.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Went randomly remembering seeing this place while at a friends place off the lake and decided to take my friend and it turned out to be a Great atmosphere, great customer service and even better recommendations! Definitely my new go to on my days off and away from sir vezas. Big Thumbs Up to Stephanie our server  , the other friendly staff and the manager Steven as well! Get some more chalk for pool, darts and pita bread next chance you get ! still overall happy I went tho!"}
{"text":"So this place has some sketchy reviews and gets a bad rap sometimes.  I swear the bar is pretty awesome,  good drinks and drink specials. Live music and happy hour. All of the food ive tried has been really good,  they have a good selection of appetizers that arent the same ol bar food.

I feel like if more people saw the newly renovated place they would like it!

The problem here is tjat the restaurant is still open later and seems like the atmosphere is too quiet to support that bar being super active.

Still, i like it and its pretty :)"}
{"text":"Not real impressed. 

We decided on a date night and made the mistake of sitting at the bar thinking we would actually get halfway decent service... 

Bartender / Barbacks are slack. Dirty glassware left in front of us after we had to request to order a couple of cocktails. Asked twice for a couple of dinner menus - given only one drink menu. Then we asked for a couple of waters. How do they manage to run out of the cucumber mix for one of their signature cocktails (the Lighthouse) in the middle a holiday weekend?

The Huevos Rancheros - since when does that dish mean a plate full of french fires (\"dusted potatoes\" as the menu says) covered in green chile sauce and a couple of eggs?  My spouse requested to see the manager - Mark.  There were no beans in the dish - even though according to him there were a \"few in there\". So, after a request for  additional beans then did the dish seem actually like something other than green chili covered plate-o-fires.

The Monte Cristo would have been a better tasting sandwich if it was more than \"Texas Sized\" bread with hardly any meat inside the actual sandwich.  For the price of the dish - try putting some actual meat inside it.  

It would also be a good idea if the bartender had a clue about the food items actually listed on the menu.  Ours did not.  

We had visited this establishment earlier in the week - Kelsea was a wonderful server.  So, that is why we are not listing our experiences at only one star.  Kelsea was courteous and attentive to us.  Sadly, the crab cakes were more \"filler\" than crab meat.  Perhaps I am spoiled from the Maryland Crab Cakes I am accustomed to from the east coast - but again, more corn meal than crab. 

Sadly, while this location has a great amount of appeal and we do wish to give our business to locally owned and operated entrepreneurs, we would have been better off and had a better dining experience at an Outback or Red Lobster."}
{"text":"Our first time here, and based on the mixed reviews we've read we weren't certain what to expect.  Upon entry, the interior looked rather plain, particularly for the exterior and setting.  We were seated on the water-front patio, and based on this, my immediate impression was that this could be our next favorite place!  The wait staff was pleasant, but the food was sub-par.  We had the pretzel bites as an appetizer - they were hard, and the cheese had a skin on it.  The fish dishes that we received were bland, and my \"garlic\" mashed potatoes (more on this in a moment) and vegetables were not evenly heated (cool spots).  My wife's entree had a side of garlic cilantro rice, and it was just rice - perhaps they were out of garlic, because my garlic mashed potatoes had no garlic ether.  The plating was also lacking (you expect more by the prices) - oh, and our entrees arrived before our silverware did.  We passed on dessert because they only had two options, and we figured both would be as bland as the entrees.  Overall this establishment is not at all living up to its potential, and it has great potential.  One last thing:  there is an office to the right of the entry lobby that is haphazardly filled with miscellaneous supplies, and the door was wide open...hardly a view any guests should see when they first walk in.  The owners must just not care.  Too bad."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I love the patio. I can't wait until it is fully finished."}
{"text":"Sick of feeling like your in the desert? NEVER a bad meal Never a bad experience! Thank you Jordan!!"}
{"text":"The Watershed has a nice size patio and an inside restaurant with a gorgeous view of the lake. We tried the spinach artichoke, Mediterranean wrap and a green chilli bacon cheeseburger. The meals were well done and very tasty. The cocktails and the draft beers are also good and well priced. Our waiter, Jessie, was friendly and attended to our requests fast and warm. At the end of our early dinner, we got to take a 15 minute boat ride. The friendly captain and beautiful views of the lake ended our date perfectly. I will gladly come back here."}
{"text":"Last night, we held a business party with my clients, (past & present), business associates, and some friends at The Watershed. Our server was Janice! She was bubbly, high energy, and incredibly friendly! She provided wonderful service to our party, and I truly don't think our party would have been as fun without her as our server! Thank you!"}
{"text":"The food was a bar type, we expected a little better menu."}
{"text":"This is in my neighborhood, so I REALLY want to like it.  The atmosphere is great, but the service is so slow it's annoying.  Food is okay, nothing that will make you want to deal with the amount of time it takes to get the food to the table.  A few tweaks, and this place could become a hot spot in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"Wow... First time there upon recommendations from friends. We made reservations for patio seating which worked out fine.  It had rained earlier that day and the couch seating was soaked in parts.  Still seated us there and warned us to avoid the wet areas.  Unfortunately the bottoms of all the cushions were wet so I ended up with wet jeans anyway.  No biggie.  It took a very long time, in excess of 10 minutes, for anyone to acknowledge we were there.  Drinks took forever.  Order apps to share at first, they were very good!  We ran out of drinks and longed for refills.  Next came the meals.  Ribs were tasty and my wife ordered the shrimp penne.  When her plate was delivered the shrimp were burned.  After waiting forever to show the waiter (who didn't come) we flagged down someone else to report our issue.  They said they would get her more shrimp.  10 more minutes and a small plate of shrimp arrived.  Burned!  We couldn't believe it!  By then the waiter stopped over.  We showed him the pile of burned shrimp we were collecting.  He said he would get her more shrimp and ran off.  We were completely finished eating and wanting to leave.  Then comes the third plate of shrimp.  Only partially burned.  Joy!  She ate the appetizing 2 and was finished.  No compensation for crappy food, no manager was notified...  Nothing.  Avoid this place."}
{"text":"We went to the Watershed with a group of friends last weekend and would for sure recommend this great restaurant to others! First, we are always looking for unique restaurants in our area and the atmosphere here was great - we loved the patio overlooking the water, the twinkle lights and when we finished watching the sunset - it got a little colder and they quickly brought us over a heater. The waiter that we had was friendly and knowledgable. (Heads up they do use a phone to take yours order)

We started with The northshore - (grilled pineapple mojito) and The Pirates cove speciality drinks. Both my husband and I are pretty particular about our drinks and these were both unique and delicious! We also tried their tortilla coconut shrimp, queso fundido and chili fries. The sauce for the shrimp was spicy so it gave this simple dish a twist and although I don't typically order fries as an appetizer - the seasoning on these were very good. 

They are still working on completing the inside and we can't wait to see it when finished. We did have 1 drink in the \"fireplace/game room\" and the decor was homey and quaint. There were several big football games playing on Saturday and the manager was accommodating and changed one of the games so we could watch our team.

All and all I am giving this a 5 star and we will be taking our parents there very soon."}
{"text":"Ok today is Feb 6  I gave them my address on Jan 21 still have not rec'd anything in the mail in regards to giving their restaurant another try. So at this point I don't want to give them another try."}
{"text":"I used to love coming to the watershed. I thought the drinks were a little overpriced, but it was a nice atmosphere, so I dealt with it. Although I doubt I will be going back after my last visit. Went with a buddy and ordered a double of Jameson on the rocks. Was having a good time so I ordered another one. It wasn't until the check came that the bartender decided to explain to me that the doubles I was drinking were $18 dollars a piece. You know it's bad when the bartender feels the need to go over your tab before running your card. Thank god he did though because had he not, a scene definitely would have been made. He said it was because the old bartenders would give away liquor for free. I'm not sure how or why that makes my drinks more expensive, but I digress. Was offered a 10% discount which I took, but didn't make a dent in the fact that I was literally being charged the price of 2 BOTTLES of whiskey for 4 shots. This place is a joke."}
{"text":"My first time there was with friends during a monsoon down pour. The building and view of the lake both before and during the storm were great. We sat at the bar and Mike took very good care of us. Good selection of brews and the appetizers were tasty as well. 
Looks like a GREAT place for a large group. The vaulted ceilings and open floor plan, coupled with the water view did transport us from \"scotching desert\" to \"waterside\". And then the live band kicked in. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Take a break from your busy, fast paced life and sit by the water at The Watershed. With very options in the Valley for dining/drinking on the water, this place brings you to tranquility. Service is on par with what to expect from a casual dining spot, but the happy hour and cocktail menu is phenomenal. 

Everyone is friendly, but don't be in a rush when you come to The Watershed because the environment is catered for the easy life. Also, this is a Green Bay Packers bar, so if you are Packers fan, this is the spot to be on game day September through January.

Don't skimp out on dessert. They have this Grasshopper Oreo Cookie thing and it's delicious. If you are lucky enough, they will even take you out on the boat."}
{"text":"This is an edited review. I gave the watershed very poor ratings before and then their manager reached out to me to give them another try. They're back and better than ever. Management has shaken things up and got this restaurant back and running. The food is top notch once again and their meatloaf is back! The service was phenomenal and I definitely would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Friendly services; The food is delicious! My fav is the meatloaf w/ green chile sauce! I like they have a variety on the menu with their own added flair to the ingredients. Large portions, serve hot. The sunset is beautiful dining outdoors on lake. Musician playing guitar singing beautifully."}
{"text":"My friends and I were so excited to try this place for breakfast, because the location and view is just stunning. We got there  at 9:00 AM when they opened and when they unlocked the door and let us in you could tell they were annoyed, they didn't greet us or anything. It didn't seem that anyone was ready for customers, coffee wasn't brewed the only thing ready was water. After we ordered another table was seated, fast forward 45 minutes that table had their food while we still did not.We had to ask for refills on our beverages multiple times which also took much longer than it should have. The food was average, not good enough to makeup for the service or overall experience. The restaurant was not busy at all (employees were sitting at the bar talking), in the 2 hours we were there we were one 4-5 tables really no excuse for the service we had. As if all this wasn't disappointing enough the bathrooms were filthy, they had not been cleaned from the night before. Very unpleasant visit, we won't be back to try again."}
{"text":"Just got home from the watershed an we would certainly go back. Service was decent, we just had to wait some for a bit to get the check. Our only real issue was the fact that both our dishes , the Greek salmon penne and the grilled shrimp pasta were both a little burned on the shrimp and salmon portion, other than that the pasta on both dishes was good, the view was great and drinks were good as well"}
{"text":"THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST RESTAURANT IVE BEEN TO IN YEARS! ! I read some negative reviews, (amidst a lot of great reviews) and I decided to go see for myself. I did not find one thing I didn't like about the place!! I was immediately greeted by friendly people, seated and attended to promptly. My margarita was superb, The server was super friendly and the food was amazing!! You have to try the grasshopper pie for dessert!!! And the views and ambience are second to none! I will 100% be back over and over again! Thanks Watershed!!!"}
{"text":"Dinner with a view! I came here with a large group, which tends to be difficult for many restaurants, but our waitress was extremely attentive, and the food was fantastic. I had the super greens salad with ahi tuna, and though the portions were generous, my plate had not a speck left on it when I finished. The real treat at this spot is the waterfront view, accompanied by optional boat rides after dinner. My group had a wonderful time here!"}
{"text":"Service was awful. We waited a hour and a half for 3 burgers. No comps no apologies. Would NOT recommend."}
{"text":"Nice place.  A little dated but the location is top notch.  This place is right on the water.  Absolutely gorgeous.  If they would fix this place up a little it would be a true find.  But if your in the area go here, the food is good and the atmosphere will make it a great spot for enjoying drinks and hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"Great place! Was a bit skeptical after reading some of the other reviews but it was great! We had the shrimp penne pasta and the grilled cheese. Both were amazing. The coleslaw that they have as a side was so unique and very delicious. We had carrot cake for dessert- it was alright. Kind of dry. They were also out of Sauvignon Blanc which was a bummer. It was dark while we were there but the view was still beautiful. You don't feel like you're in the desert. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I don't want to write this review, because I always want to be able to get a good spot on the patio for happy hour. The fewer people that know about this place, the better my odds!
My first visit here was for a wedding on the patio. There was something so beautiful and magical about the bride and groom arriving to the ceremony by boat, and watching the sunset over the water certainly added to the experience. The food was buffet style Mexican - and quite tasty.
I went back for a happy hour with my sister. The margaritas and sangrias were a great compliment to a warm spring day. The weather on the patio was perfect - and having a cocktail while watching another sunset on the water was just as peaceful, beautiful and enchanting as it had been for the wedding.
We didn't have much by way of food. A couple of orders of wings, fries, and guacamole. I think they were all good. Honestly, they may have been mediocre, but with fantastic company and this setting, they would have tasted great no matter what.
The staff is friendly and laid back, and I am thrilled to have a waterfront happy hour just minutes from my office. Perfect mini-vacation. This will definitely be on my regular rotation!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the middle of tempe. Staff was awesome, food is solid. The tri tip dip was delicious. Beer selection is also solid and the patio is fantastic."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely terrible.   The only thing available was a brunch for 19.99 so we tried it.   Some of the food was burned, some was either warmed up or overcooked.   We only ate about half what was available and it was not good.   Very amature food for a place like this.   Even with only a few people there the service was bad.   We have gone here once before and the service and food weren't good that time either but since it's such a beautiful place we tried again.   Won't try again."}
{"text":"We love out local neighborhood bar! They have a great selection of food & drink, and am extremely happy to see some dishes from New Mexico on the menu. If you can, sit on the patio for amazing sunset views over the lake."}
{"text":"I had my graduation here last year and it couldn't have been more perfect. My parents loved the boat ride around the lake, my friends loved the outdoor patio where they played corn hole and drank some beers and my little cousins were enjoying the live music. I wish I would give this place more than 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I rarely write a negative review and try to find the positive in everything, but I can't hold myself back from sharing my experience of my 30th birthday here. 

Let me start by saying I've had 2 large events here prior (a surprise engagement brunch and a 30th birthday for my friend) so it was one of the first thoughts for my 30th birthday on the patio. My husband emailed them more than a month prior to the night of our dinner inquiring about a reservation for 30 on the patio. My husband received a confirmation from yelp for a reservation without speaking to anyone which was odd. So he called and finally got ahold of a manager. She told us no problem to a reservation on the patio with the option of going inside for those who were cold since there's no heater. We told them some people might eat, some might just get drinks. All sounded great. 

The day of the party in the morning, my husband gets a call from the host saying we see you have a large reservation for tonight and I'm just letting you know our policy has changed and you can't do separate checks. To which we replied - you thought the morning of was a good idea to tell us this? Not going to work for us - you're going to have to honor what you offered a month prior since you didn't give us time to know. We had to talk to the manager and get it straightened out and they finally said they would honor it. 

Thank god we showed up an hour and a half early to eat our own dinner. We got there and the host seemed confused. She said sorry, we don't have room for you on the patio. There's other groups and it doesn't say you wanted the patio. We have too many reservations tonight. We can try and put you in the captains room. The room is nice enough, don't get me wrong, but not what we asked for and not what we wanted. We asked to speak to the manager. No one could find him and it took about 20 minutes to talk to someone. He tried his best to be polite, but continued to tell us there was a communication error. He didn't ever say sorry, just that there was an error. Then said he would look at the other reservations and call them and see if they would change their reservations. ????? He came back and showed me a patio area that could seat 20 and a couch with a fire pit. I said thank you, this is perfect and we'd like this area. He took the opportunity to tell me that they were \"helping us out and doing us a favor by doing separate checks tonight since the policy changed.\" Honestly - what poor timing. It was like let me remind you that you can't have a need from us since we're allowing separate checks. It just rubbed me the wrong way. 

We asked if we could have the fire pit lit. They didn't have propane. They did bring us blankets. 

Fast forward 20 minutes into the night and waiting for guests still. The host ended up sitting a group at the couch we had just reserved. I said to our server and host hold on - we just worked this out. The manager came back. And no joke, he said to me, \"Really? There's no one sitting there. You have all this space do you really need the space?\"

I finally told him this was clearly too much for him to handle and we would make our own evening work and not leave the area. It was too frustrating and was just ruining the night. 

When the night started to die down, maybe about 1000, we moved into the bar area since we were cold. There were 10 of us left. They turned on the lights, shut off the music, and the bartender came to us to see if she could take any of our empty drinks. It was pretty clear we were being pushed out or the restaurant was closing 2 hours early on a Saturday. 

Food is good - try the chorizo burger it is great. The view is pretty on the patio. The brunch with mimosas has always been a success for us. Our server was amazing for my birthday in spite of everything and we made sure to give her extra cash tip because she was a trooper and was really pleasant. 

Don't do a big party and trust them with your event - you're better off keeping it small and just show up."}
{"text":"Groupons are meant to introduce you and make sure you want to come back. Highlights of the Watershed are the atmosphere and the boat ride.
Our server when asked for info on the boat ride- read our groupon and said ONE boat ride. He had the personality of a rock. Our drinks were so- so ( we waited 15 minutes for even water). The\" tacos\" we ordered for our one appetizer looked like ONE on the plate. The one taco was flat under the other. 
One tortilla side was crispy and dry. The other was soggy and dough. How that even happens is beyond me. The meat was stringy. Our server never came back to see how the drinks and food were. When I told him our taco situation- he stated\" well, I have never eaten those\" took our plates and walked away. I apologized to my man as this was a surprise date
Worth going for a cocktail and boat ride. Find another venue for good food and service"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved my experience here.  The view is gorgeous from pretty much any seat and the service was exemplary.  Alex was attentive and friendly and made me laugh multiple times.  Everything about our order was correct and He kept checking on us after the food came which is so rare these days.  Liz came around and made us feel like we were old friends.  Beer during happy hour is dirt cheap, and food is delicious.  Can't wait to try brunch on the weekend!"}
{"text":"I was concerned about going after reading some of these reviews.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  We had a large group and we were well attended to and the food was delish.  The ONLY thing I would say is for the price of the Lakehouse Pie, they should use a leaner meat as I found the meat hard to chew and lots of grisley fat throughout."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! We'll definitely be back when we're in town. Conveniently located and beautiful lakefront view gorgeous patio seating"}
{"text":"We went to Tempe's newest lake view restaurant a few weeks ago with a large group and enjoyed the patio at the picnic table area. We went for Happy Hour, but they currently only have drink specials, no food specials. Would be nice if they have some food specials to keep up with what other places are doing for h.h. $1  off beer & specialty cocktails and $5 house cocktails and wine. Hours for Happy Hr. are 3pm to 6pm, T-F.
We had the cobb salad for $13. which was good, but was advertised as having jalapeno buttermilk ranch dressing and I expected a little spice from it, there was no spice at all. Tasted just like ranch. We also had the burger which was $10. and came with a choice of toppings and a side like fries. I think there were other choices of sides, but I can't recall now. The server was friendly and gave us separate checks,which is a must in a large group! 
The view is nice as it is on a lake and the \"party\" boats came out about sunset and was fun to watch all the boaters.
The inside of the place is still under going renovations,but there is seating inside as well. There are quite a few steps to get to the patio, but there are a few ramps inside to get you to the patio. The inside bar looks like a great place when they finish with it.

I will be back soon, but probably will eat inside as the weather in the Phoenix area is heating up.
The place was quite busy for mid week at 4:30pm,we wanted the area with backs to the chairs,but the area was already full by the time we arrived.(patio)

Dan-please add some food happy hour specials."}
{"text":"I had almost forgotten about this place after moving out of the Lakes area. And after my recent Sunday Funday jaunt, I remember why I love this hidden gem amidst the desert playground. Where else can you feel like you got transported to some serene hideaway with sunset views that can only be matched by the friendly faces that dine here? This is such a great local spot that gives you the neighborhood vibe of a warm welcome the minute you walk in. If you just want a low key spot to catch the games, there's plenty of screens and bar seating to keep you entertained. Otherwise, the local music talent serenades you while you gab over with friends. My fave pairing is definitely the sliders with jalapenos accompanied by the house salad with grilled shrimp. To balance out the spice kick, drink up on the Kronenburg Blanc. You really can't go wrong except if you happen to miss the sky kissing you good night as the sun sets."}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials! Great food! Great drinks! Our waitress Janice was so sweet and so great!"}
{"text":"Watershed hosted a birthday party for my wife and fifty of our closest friends. They were extremely gracious and helpful from the get go. The bar area was perfect for our event and the Watershed has a great casual atmosphere. They even allowed my son's band to play on their stage. Would highly recommend for any event or party."}
{"text":"We went here for Mother's Day brunch. The view is the best thing about this restaurant (and only good thing).  The service was horrible and it took forever to get our drinks.  The food was mediocre, not worth $48 per person.  It stated that there would be free boat rides, which is why I reserved Mother's Day Brunch.  We literally were on the boat and got kicked off by the captain.  He wanted a \"larger\" party on the boat instead.  When he came back around again, the battery was dead.  This is after we had waited over an hour.  My ten year old daughter was very upset. Never again Watershed."}
{"text":"Food was good. Really liked the music they were playing. Waterfront location is awesome, but they could use a little more shade on their patio. Server Aaron was cool and moved us from the main patio to a side one where it was shadier."}
{"text":"Really dissapointed with the menu and the service.  I don't mind paying a premium for lakeside dining but it must be worth it.  I have family that live in the lakes and this was my 1st time.  I was thinking it would be a nice place for my Mother's birthday dinner sadly the menu and the staff were seriously lacking.  Our waitress read everything off a phone which really turned me off, she looked at the phone more than the people at the table.  I tried to order a beer but both of my choices were no longer carried but still on the menu.  We had 2 orders of crab cakes which where a mistake, more bread crumbs than crab.  I thought it was funny they serve a 15.99 tri tip sandwich with kettle chips and charge $2 to upgrade to fries.....  Was thinking about the ribs but $27.99 for a rack.  I had a $16 Greek salad and the dressing was aweful the dressing was way too sweet (never had sweet greek dressing people) and the chicken was dry and overcooked.  Bathrooms were dirty and the staff was poorly dressed.  Sorry but extremely short jean shorts and cowboy boots were worn in poor taste by the staff.  Do yourself a favor and don't go there for anything other than happy hour for a drink."}
{"text":"We came here for a family Easter brunch and should have walked out and not wasted our money. Overpriced food for the amount you get, horrible service (had to wait over 30+ minutes for the server to take our order), and the management at this facility was no help. We complained over 3 times to the manager who we got no apology from. After waiting 30 minutes to have our order taken, it then took another 30 minutes for the food to come out, and over half the orders were wrong. At this point, we were starving and were forced to eat something we didn't order. The food was average but nothing to brag about. Upon leaving,w e noticed the manager sitting at the bar. We wont be back. This place is a great location, and has a great curb appeal, but it lacks good management and staff which kills it's business."}
{"text":"Understaffed for a Father's Day Sunday!! Music was good, food was cold and incomplete. Everyone got their food and was eating, by the time I got my cold breakfast that was missing items. I gave it a 2 because Sylvia the waitresss, was running her behind off trying to get us everything we asked for and the music and ambiance was awesome. Food awful."}

{"text":"Man where do I start..... We made a Mother's Day reservation for one of the 1st reservations of the day.  1st when we got there some of us had to use the restroom after the 45 + minute drive there.  The bathrooms were so nasty dirty like nobody cleaned them the night before. The mens room had no paper towels and the women's bathroom my wife said was so dirty with towels on the floor everywhere.   (Hopefully their kitchen isn't like this.) So we do get seated at our reservation time then takes about 15 mins for someone to introduce themselves as our waiter. Then after we order drinks it takes so long we have to go to the bar to get our own mimosas. After another 15 mins of sitting there waiting we final get to order our food.  Waiting and waiting for our waiter to even come by to order another round of drinks we are now 1 hour and 15 minutes in and we don't have food or more drinks.  So we hit the 1 hour and 30 minute mark and we decided to talk to someone and just leave still without any food. If they knew Mother's Day was a big day for them they should of been prepared!   Nice place but our 1st impression not so good.   Hopefully they get their act together.  Had to make plan B in their parking lot so my wife, mother in law, wife's grandma and aunt all had the Mother's Day they deserved!"}
{"text":"My wife and I joined a group of coworkers last night for an informal dinner gathering. The atmosphere is INCREDIBLE! Beautiful patio, beautiful view, corn hole games, darts, billiards and a great menu. I am not sure if our group overwhelmed the staff, but we had a few big misses in service. Incredibly friendly staff, but just struggled to get things correct. Meals were incorrect for a few of our party. Solutions were so slow that we passed on a couple of the efforts (like missing chicken on the chicken nachos...the chicken was brought out nearly 30 minutes after we reported the missing key ingredient). Another member ordered a salmon salad and when all the meals were delivered we were told they didn't have any salmon. Another meat was selected and then 15 minutes later a salad arrived with a big junk of salmon on top....weird. Prices were HIGH too! Those nachos with no chicken were $13. Anyways, go for a nice spot to get drinks but don't expect the execution in the kitchen to match the scenery."}
{"text":"Karaoke every Friday at 9pm! Best place for Karaoke on Friday Night! Reverse Happy Hour too! Was good..... HA!"}
{"text":"Gross. Worst enchiladas ever. Disgusting. The bruschetta was equally gross. Expensive, wait for food was long."}
{"text":"Have come here a time or two and usually everything was ok. Mostly come to just hang out by the lake and have a few drinks. I mean who doesn't want a $15 bottle of champagne on Sunday. That was the best thing about the meal. We were seated outside and it was hot and windy so we asked to switch. Which seemed like the end of the world. I 10 minutes later a server came with water for the table. We got champagne and kids got their drinks. She returned 15 minutes later with drinks and got our order. Service was mediocre and food was decent. There's a promotion going on if you spend $35 you get $10 off for a 5 star yelp. Desperate for good feedback? Solution-write a 5 star yelp and edit it. Unethical-sure. But who wouldn't want $10 off $35. This place could be great since it's on the water and has decent food."}
{"text":"Love this place; it's always a great experience. Ordered fish tacos and some bubbly the last time I visited for a celebratory lunch. Highly recommend sitting on the outside patio facing the water- especially during sunset. Fantastic views. Yummy food. And solid drink menu. Unfortunately, I don't remember what rosé or champagne I ordered; however, it was tasty. I've had mixed drinks there too, and they always manage to go down nicely & fairly quickly #perusual I def recommend this place to those who haven't experienced this beautiful venue."}
{"text":"My birthday party was amazing. 2 servers were able to handle a table with 30 people. It was exactly what I hoped for. The private party room, drink service, amazing food, and cigars and scotch on the patio at night. I have never been happier! Thank you so much. The staff is great."}
{"text":"Great food, awesome environment! We came in for the end of happy hour, stayed for an awesome dinner on the patio overlooking the water. They have solid deals for drinks and food, and everything was delicious. Aaron took good care of us, and all his recommendations were spot on! The \"Shed\" burger is a must, fried egg, avocado, so bomb!"}
{"text":"Beautiful view and great looking restaurant! Horrible service.  Was seated and spent 20 minutes without someone asking if we needed even water.  Waiters passing our table the whole time."}
{"text":"The service is horrible. I'm pretty sure the waiter is on some kind of drugs. The food is 3 stars. The view is beautiful. The service is horrible."}
{"text":"Had a good experience here despite some previous reviews, and the food was delicious.  We were told that they have only been open 4 months, so there is still some training going on, but our service was excellent.  I ordered the chicken enchiladas which were very good (with a true NM green chile sauce).  Also had several Hurricanes on happy hour - very tasty and \"effective\" ;)  We sat on the patio on the afternoon with a little wind and the umbrellas are not weighted down, so be careful that they don't fall on you.  Our server noted he's told management several times but nothing has been done - a little disheartening to hear a safety issue with a simple fix has fallen on deaf ears from employees."}
{"text":"The only reason this place is getting two stars is because the location is AWESOME and the hostess was an absolute gem! I have been here a few times, again because the patio is stellar. The first time my food was awesome, I had a grilled cheese with sautéed mushrooms and onions. Everytime else has been VERY lacking. 

First I would like to mention if in your two years of being open I have never seen the same menu twice perhaps that is something that needs immediate attention. This particular time really irked me. They just rolled out their new menu which seemed okay at best, but way over priced once the food came out. I ordered \"beef and pork tacos\" off their happy hour menu, which only is one food item each day. The tacos came out with, I kid you not, meat and tortilla, NOTHING else. The lady next to me ordered tacos as well chicken and she at least had cheese on hers. They had a pinch full of shredded lettuce and I counted 4 pieces of diced tomato on the side, which wasn't even enough to put on two tacos as small as they were. When the server returned a long time later I asked if this was how the tacos were intended to be served AKA with meat and tortilla. His response was, it is off the happy hour menu, as if that means it shouldn't have standard taco ingredients. The other lady asked if we could at least get some salsa to put on it since the meat was SUPER dry. Again a very long wait later he returned. I had actually eaten most of my taco since I figured he had forgotten. 

Someone at the table had ordered a moscow mule as well and it was almost clear. Last time I checked they had ginger beer which is ginger colored. I tried a sip, it was awful!

Seriously Watershed you are so lucky your location is awesome and I have friends that can walk to this place because really you are getting worse by the minute. I will not even return with friends at this point."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service! Way better than Pier 54 next door. Jennifer Clark the manger made sure our party and our pregnant friend were comfortable since the air conditioner was struggling. I'd recommend that Steve to wait on you every time! Love this place!"}
{"text":"The worst experience I've ever had for an Easter Brunch as far as management and service goes. Best part was the bus boy and the food.  We had reservations at 10:45am and were seated immediately outside only to have to wait 30 minutes to even order any food. Normally for an Easter Brunch this would be normal if they were jam packed and busy but this wasn't the case. They were probably at 20% capacity when we got there and not too much more when we left 2 hours later. We had to go get the manager to finally order our food and even that took an additional 30 minutes to be delivered to our table. I ordered the tamales and received a burrito. I wound up just eating it since I didn't want to wait another hour to get it corrected. Half of the sides weren't delivered and we had to ask for them again. The manager tried to make it right with a 10% discount but even she was about as bland as the service. It's clear that the problem with this place starts with the manager. As we were leaving she was sitting at the bar as her wait staff was dealing with 2 other tables complaining about their orders and bills being completely messed up. The atmosphere here is great as well as the food but I will not be back and most of my table conveyed the same to me as we were leaving. Get it together manager.  Your wait staff is horrible!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed.  We were seated promptly but had to wait forever for our waitress to take our drink order and then again for her to take our food order.   She wasn't on top of refills at all. The food was mediocre - under seasoned, and my entree was supposed to have a white wine butter sauce, it came out with a small dribble of oily something.  We had five in our party and our food came out in three rounds with about five minutes in between each.  The Mac and cheese (which was $5 for a small cup- yikes) for my son was cold as were my mashed potatoes, and my husband's dish had more sun dried tomatoes than anything else in it and was swimming in a thick glue like Alfredo sauce.  Our waitress seemed incredibly distracted even though the restaurant was almost empty. I think we were her only table but she didn't check on us much,  and kept \"forgetting\" things we asked for. There's too many other good restaurants in the area for us to waste our time coming back."}
{"text":"Great location, facilities, atmosphere and views. Just wish management would prioritize good service. That's the only ingredient missing from making this place great. And maybe a little better happy hour specials too, as drink prices are a bit high."}
{"text":"I really like it here. The food was amazing and the view is great. The atmosphere is relaxed. My only complaint was the service. 

I'll start with the food. I had the coconut shrimp that came with a sauce that had a spicy after taste to it. My bf had the monte cristo. Really good with a very sweet maple syrup that also had a spicy after bite. My absolute favorite was the lobster trap. It's a shot of vodka, an amazing tasting Lobster claw after shot, a session lager and last a piece of lobster. 

Now to the service. Our server is Ryan d. She seemed to rush us out, got everyone else to come up to us so she didn't have to and didn't notice our empty drinks (doubt she cared). As I look around the patio, everyone else has a glass of water w a straw in it but us. We ordered 4 shots and a drink and she didn't offer us any water? I'm pretty heated. Were usually pretty good tippers. This is the first time we've left nothing.  

We might be back just for those amazing lobster claw shots but definitely going to ask for a different server."}
{"text":"Where to begin with the Watershed.  I love this place.  It can be pricey, however the great patio and views of the lake make it worth it.  The ambiance is laid back and the music selection is generally very good.  The very spacious patio overlooks this man made lake in Tempe.  It's a hidden gem that you really wouldnt expect to find in the area. 

My favorite time to go is during their really good happy hour which I believe is 3:30-6:30pm M-F.  I get my usual vodka cocktail and its $3 (even for a tall).  The food is a little expensive for my budget so I generally don't eat there, however it looks fantastic.  

If you're looking for a place to unwind with good views and good people, the Watershed is a place to try!"}
{"text":"What a great atmosphere for a place in Tempe. If you haven't gone here yet, its the best place in Tempe to eat outside. My girlfriend and I love it here. Great outside patio and a HUGE inside bar. Great beer selection and great house drinks...the hurricane is awesome and so its the sangria!! If you have a perfect AZ weather day, treat yourself to this awesome place!!!"}
{"text":"I'm really sad this place is disappointing, I live in the lakes neighborhood and it's a great idea to have a restaurant on the lake in our back yard.  Service is slow and servers aren't friendly or helpful. Such a waste and wish this place could get in the hands of better management"}
{"text":"I am so sad I can't give 5 stars as I really wanted to love this place.

Positives: the atmosphere is great! They restaurant is big, decor nice, lots of TV's if you are a sports fan, GREAT live band, and right on the water which was beautiful.

The service was also really good. Our waiter, Mike, was super friendly, he checked on is frequently and our food and drinks came out quickly.

Now the negatives: the food. The menu has a good selection, I would have preferred a couple of healthier options, but that is just my preference. Everything that we ordered just didn't seem fresh, it was bad bar food.

The crab cakes were pretty dense and not super hot, like they were premade and then reheated. Same goes for the kids quesadilla. I didn't think we could go wrong ordering that for our 2 year old, but once again, it seemed reheated. The cheese seemed old and not hot or gooey like it should be. The fries that came with were hot to touch but not cooked all the way. My husband had the ribs and those were actually quite good. The meatloaf was decent but I was hoping for better. And I think the mashed potatoes were the worst, just bad diner style.

I will still go back, but now with the mindset of listening to great music or watching the game at the bar!"}
{"text":"At the watershed, we sat outside, and though it was hot with minimal shade, it gave us a pleasant view of the lake. I had the chicken sandwich, which was much larger than I had expected. The food was wonderful and the service was great. Afterwards we had been given a free boat ride that was very relaxing. The experience that we had was both relaxing and satisfying and I am ready to give it a five star rating."}
{"text":"I've been here twice at dinner time and had the same experience both times.  More than half of the entree items were not available and were \"still being prepped, should be ready for you to order in 30 minutes.\"  Those in my party wanted to try these items because they sounded great, but did not get the chance.  The items we got (burgers) were overpriced for what they are.  The one saving grace of this place is that the wait staff is always friendly.  I really wanted to like this place because of the great views and cool vibe inside."}
{"text":"Best kept secret in Tempe! 
We had no idea this place was here and stumbled across it. The service was excellent! I couldn't make up my mind on what I wanted to eat so I asked our server to surprise me. She brought out the Tri-Tip Dip. It was incredible!  The meat was cooked perfectly and topped with a homemade horseradish sauce and some crispy thin onion rings. Then there was this bun that was so light, flaky and buttery that I can't even do justice trying to describe. My fiancé had the meat loaf with the green chile sauce. He loved it! 
We sat outside on the deck. It was so beautiful and relaxing that we didn't want to leave. Everyone there was so friendly. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is the poorest managed restaurant. We went a few months ago. There were maybe 20 patrons. We waited 10 minutes for the hostess. She sat us outside. Midway thru the 15 minute wait for the wait staff, they asked us to move tables. We chalked it up to a bad day and decided to go back today. Again,  we waited 5 minutes for the hostess. There was not more than 15 guests. She told us there was a 35 minute wait because they were short of wait staff. The owner needs to stop bringing his family here and hire a real manager"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant and gave it 2 chances.  It has great views and good service BUT the kitchen has fatal issues.  They need a new back of the house manager to get meals out in a timely manner, and a new chef so that the meals are memorable. Twice the order for a person in my party was missed, causing them to sit without any dinner while others are eating.  On both occasions we waited for hours for dinners.  Three hours for a one course meal is incompetence.  The meals were dull and uneventful.  The salmon was cooked well, but flavorless, and needed a sauce.  There won't be a third time, this diner, along with 8 of her friends, will dine elsewhere."}
{"text":"What a waste of a beautiful space! I had terrible service with unfriendly servers, and the food wasn't better than a dive bar. That's unfortunate, because this place is beautiful! The Watershed has a pontoon boat they will take you out on for free on certain days - what a draw - only to be let down by terrible food and barely mediocre drinks. Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"We made a reservation before we went. They called us three times in two hours to confirm it which was a little odd. We were seated on the patio next to the water, very picturesque. It was an early December evening so a bit cool but they came around and offered warm blankets which was nice. DH had the burger and I had the fish & chips, both were good. Our waiter was attentive at first then disappeared after we got our food so had to flag another down for water refills. After dinner we took the boat ride and looked at Christmas lights. The captain was very nice. It made for a fun date night and we liked that it was different than the average restaurant. We want to return and bring others."}
{"text":"Wonderful weekend brunch on the patio! Great atmosphere, food and service! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Horrible service. We have been waiting 20 minutes no server showed up even ask for drinks."}
{"text":"Ordered the Super Green Salad -not what they served me.  Their menu describes it as \"12.99
Arugula, kale and spinach, tossed with pears, blue cheese, candied pecans, hard boiled egg, bacon, tomatoes and basil-pesto vinaigrette\".  Not ONE pear in it, and verly little arugula!!  Not to mention it was dry with very little dressing.  Went with a large group for happy hour.  Felt bad for my friend who asked for their happy hour appetizer special for the day.  They were told the menu item was incorrect, and that it was a different item.  Waiter then came back and said there was NO happy hour appeitzer special for that day.  Who cares if this place is on the lake.  Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Sat outside on the patio. Accommodated our group of 8 no problem. Food was excellent. Must stop when in Tempe."}
{"text":"This place is within walking distance of my house and has an amazing view, so I really wanted to like it. 

My first visit was at happy hour on a week night. It was about half full and our waitress was great when she was around. The queso was good, the drinks were tasty, and the entrees were ok, but nothing fantastic. 

My second visit was for Sunday brunch. The sign said to seat ourselves but the hostess followed us around, clearly trying to guide us to where she wanted us to sit. The brunch buffet is $19 and not worth it. Service was slow, drinks from the bar were slower, and my friend's made to order omelet took nearly 20 minutes to arrive. 

I will not be returning for a third visit any time soon."}
{"text":"First time here and I LOVE IT!! Nice servers good food... I highly recommend this place for drinks and eats"}
{"text":"Held a party in their private room which was nicely decorated including a fireplace and a couple of tvs.  The food, service, and views were outstanding.  Also, the owners were there and came by to check on us and introduce themselves.  We felt like we were in their home and it was a great experience for our family.  With over 40 guests there was a nice blend of food, activity, and adventure.  They even took us on a pontoon boat to see the area.  Very cool and fun place with a lively atmosphere.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"What a cool setting, the patio is awesome. Jan is quite an awesome server. 

Beer selection was decent, with a good array of brands, but mostly ales, and light beers

They did have Guinness, so that's a win!

Food was good, maybe a bit expensive but good portions means the value is there!

I'd come back"}
{"text":"I have never been so disappointed by a restaurant before. We had a reservation for 7:15 and were seated by 7:20 which was great. After we ordered our meals and waited an hour and fifteen minutes for the food to come, we decided we cannot keep waiting, and walked out. They offered everyone around us chips and salsa because they knew it was taking longer then expected but apparently we did not count. It is a real shame because we had high hopes as the atmosphere and menu seemed really nice."}
{"text":"Nice place to eat dinner was good and the atmosphere was awesome I recommend this place"}
{"text":"Beautiful setting on a lake which is pretty unique in the Phoenix metro area.  All of the employees from the hostess, to bartenders and waiters were friendly, but I have never seen a restaurant so short staffed. There was a wedding reception on property and the restaurant was stretched far beyond its capacity. As a result we waited and waited all night, finally leaving over 3 hours after we arrived."}
{"text":"It was a very special day today for me and my bf to celebrate. We bring waiting to actually come to this place till we made it. 

We waited 20 mins and no-one even came to ask us for drinks or anything. 
Very few options on the menu and service the worst. 

The view is nice but honestly no even worth it with that kind of service. We end up leaving."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The atmosphere is awesome! The view is spectacular! The drinks are delicious! This is one of my favorite date night spots."}
{"text":"Omg! What a pleasant find. Just moved here from New York and was looking for a good quiet place to take my wife and kids to for a special occasion and this place was perfect. Great food, Nelly begins the bar is awesome! Drinks were great and Heather the manager made sure we had the perfect table and even organized taking us out on the house boat for a short ride to keep the kids entertained. Amazing at night with the lights. Never thought AZ could offer this experience at a neighborhood restaurant. Will be frequently coming back. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Our server Latesia was fantastic! Nice boat house feel. Lakeside view for brunch never gets old."}
{"text":"This place has such cool ambiance, the patio on the water is awesome and there is plenty of space inside. Aside from that I don't have much nice to say about it. The service was actually the top five worst of my life. At one point the server didn't come to check on us for 42 minutes. We had empty drinks and no water when he finally made an appearance we asked for the bill which took another full 21 minutes to get. Drinks were good food was mediocre at best. I want to like this place so bad but sadly I can't say there is much to recommend or return to."}
{"text":"I LOVE THE WATERSHED! The service is amazing and they just released a new menu and it literally took me 20 minutes to decide because everything sounded so delicious! Finally, I decided on the Mahi Mahi burger and DAMN was it good!! Ambience is relaxing and the sun sets right on the lake, so you can't beat the view. They make their ginger beer from scratch so the Moscow mules are the best I've ever had. The manager, Heather, checked on us and made sure we had everything we needed and were taken care of adequatley. She is such a sweet heart and is really turning this place around to encompass it's true potential!!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I stopped in today for lunch. We seated ourself's then it took our severs several minutes before he came over to ask use what we wanted to drink. We both had Arnold Palmers. Then we ordered the bruschetta. It was came out in a good timely fashion and was very tasty. We finished our drinks and I had to wave down our sever who was talking at the bar to another server or person who worked there. He said oh I saw you, I was talking. I replied that he should have acknowledge me as I was waving my arm around for a minute trying to get his attention. He should have at least looked my way in acknowledgement. I really do not like to have to wave down a server when we are one of three tables in the restaurant and the only one in his section. Then we asked the other server waiting the table across from if he could check for our food because we had been waiting so long. And it came out warm not hot. 

So long story short.
Foods great. Service sucks. I guess that is what happens when you have high school and college kids working for you not professionals or people who truly care about your business."}
{"text":"Great place to get a drink on the lake. The views are  amazing and they have a boat they will take you out on. Huge on the inside would be great for events. We came here for the after party for the IT movie premier. The owners son was the little boy in the movie. That was pretty cool. Food was just ok my fish was pretty bland but the flat bread my friends got looked pretty good. Def a great date place. Check it out just for the awesome atmosphere. Don't find a lot of lake restaurants in AZ"}
{"text":"Great family place. Great view of the lake. This place is a hidden jem. #1 place for a restaurant on a lake in AZ. You won't find a more majestic place to take your significant other . Happy hour all day Tuesday-Thursday. The hours are a little weird but they are always open at 4pm-8pm"}
{"text":"I can't remember what this places used to be back in the day. Sadly it looks exactly the same as it did back then only no one took care of it. Being on the lake is nice. Beautiful views. The interior lacked the \"umph\" needed for a place with such a great view. Wobbly tables, the lack of decor and the plethora of dust and cob webs that line the ceiling give this place a dumpy feel. My husband wanted pretzel bites w their own cheese and they tasted as if they were microwaved and the cheese tasted as if it came straight from the can. I had the fresh ahi tuna on top of a salad. The seared tuna was \"seared\" black. Hardly seared if you burn it. It tasted like bad stinky feet. My husband had the shepards pie and you really can't go wrong there. We also ordered the brownie sundae and it was beyond sweet for me. All and all, not the best place I've eaten in but certainly not the worst. I would come back but will never come back again on date night with my husband."}
{"text":"The view, from any table here, is amazing! The booth was perfect to feed the baby while we ate. Great food, great time!"}
{"text":"Disappointed.  
Positive: lovely building-clean and modern.  Beautiful views.  Had hoped to sit outside but there  wasn't enough shade covering.  
Negative:  food was just O.K.   My husbands salmon was very small, my son and his wife said their meals were OK only.  My salad was very bland, hardly any dressing however the shrimp on top were done very nicely. 
I ordered one of their house drinks but the waitress came back and said they didn't have all the ingredients to make it.  Really? A signature drink?  We ordered desert and wanted both a hot tea and a coffee to have with it.  No hot tea available.  My husbands coffee didn't arrive until after desert. She said they had to make some.  The cup was only 2/3rds full.  Waitress said she wouldn't charge him for it as it took so long but the charge was on the bill. 
We were looking forward to going here because of the anticipated ambiance by the lake.  So sad we won't be going back now."}
{"text":"I live across the lake and decided to try their happy hour because it looked like a cute joint being on the lake. The drinks were amazing! The prices were a bit high, but worth how good the drinks were! The jolly man was awesome!! I also had a couple different food items, the queso is a joke. It's melted shredded cheese on a thin tiny skillet with meat, very oily, hard and not very satisfying. The shredded tacos were dry and bland and the shrimp Ceasar salad had such a weird after taste I just wasted it. The staff was great! At first I thought our waitress was texting in front of us but realized she was taking our orders! I will definitely be back for the drinks, but not order any food."}
{"text":"So disappointing. Being from out of town, a friend recommended this place prewarning me it was a great environment, right on the lake, good food with typically bad service. Since we were warned, the environment outweighed and we decided it would be fun for the families. Be warned - the service is REALLY bad. 

When we arrived we asked if we could sit by the grass for the kids. Typically there are tables there and there were none. They were not willing to accommodate. Once seated it took 10 min to meet our waitress. When she came by we immediately ordered kids food and then asked about the type of fish in the fish tacos. When she came back over another 10 minutes later the answer was mahi. Great- so after placing the orders, she says 'oh I forgot we are only doing brunch menus today'. Stunned, we looked at what was on the bunch menu at Saturday at 1pm and it was all breakfast foods. We asked if Fish Tacos were on brunch menu - no. Again stunned as why would you confirm the fish with the kitchen and tell us the fish? It was truly the lack of any remorse for the fact that we'd been there over 30 minutes and the breakfast menu should be no big deal that made us ask for a manager. The manager that came out was the initial hostess who I really don't think was the manager - otherwise I full question the owners care and value in this restaurant whatsoever.  She also offered no apology or remorse so we asked for the check for the kids meal and left. So sad as it really could be so great."}
{"text":"This was a miss. Terrible bar food. The green murky water outside made us feel like we were near a swamp. 
The service was fantastic."}
{"text":"Over all okay. I wouldn't object to coming again. I got the chicken noodle bowl. Yellow curry with coconut milk with rice noodles, chicken, tomatoes and cucumber. The chicken was very delicious, the yellow curry and coconut milk mixture was a bit bland. I thought that the raw tomato and cucumber were strange choices of vegetables; I just ate around those. Very nice environment. I suppose I was pretty impressed considering all the other one star reviews. I had no problem with the service. All in all, a pretty average place with okay food; a nice place to hang out."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and that was all!  I have never sent food or drink back at a restaurant but I had to here, it was not edible (meatloaf). The Margarita was straight mixer, not good. I could hear someone yelling towards the back, turns out the manager was screaming at employees! The server handled all the issues like a pro, which tells me she has to do it often.  really bummed, I wanted to love this place since its in walking distance of my home. Maybe go here just for a beer and the lake view."}
{"text":"Beautiful property, with wonderful view of a . The lake sets the mood for any occasion."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! Incredible view! The spinach artichoke dip and calamari to die for!! Waitstaff was prompt and attentive! Everyone is so friendly!  The Canadian walleye was amazing too and specialty cocktails on happy hour, all infusions done in house. I enjoyed the La Frutilla margarita! Yum! Will be back soon with friends!!"}
{"text":"The location and architecture was beautiful, but the service was severely lacking. Service was quite slow, the queso appetizer was tiny, I received the wrong entree, and it took half an hour to get the check at the end. They seemed to be closing up the restaurant well before the hours stated, and decided to ignore us for most of the evening.

I will give this restaurant another chance, but just for drinks, definitely not for dinner."}
{"text":"such a great place!! my boyfriend and I went in early on a Sunday morning and we had such a gorgeous view and the manager and our server were great!! yummy food and drinks! we'll definitely be back. next time we'll be taking an uber so we can drink more hehe :) I'm SOOOO glad I didn't listen to the bad reviews. can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"This has so much potential. The location is just lovely and feels so different and special compared to other options in Tempe. It is perched right on the lakeside overlooking beautiful homes, boats and nice scenery. I made a reservation which was completely useless because there wasn't anyone there for brunch at all anyway. When we got there, there was no one available to help us and we weren't sure that they were even open. Twenty minutes later when we finally got someone to notice us and seat us, we looked over the menu and ordered. The food is pretty dreadful and uninspired. One of our drinks came from the bar with a little bug in it. Our server didn't seem to care much about anything at all. I won't go back here ever but I'll try the restaurant next door since it looks nicer!"}
{"text":"Food was great all around and the patio area was great for kids to roam around! The free boat ride was a perfect end to a great lunch!"}
{"text":"The Watershed is located in a pretty nice area and sits right on the side of a lake with great views. The inside is wide open with high ceilings, a bar and a pool table.
Everything seemed to be fairly clean and our waitress was friendly enough. There were a couple things I found off putting though.
I went for breakfast on a Sunday with several people right as they were opening.
 
1.) When we were seated we were given dinner menus and then no one came back to the table for 15min. Once someone did finally come back around we asked for the appropriate menu only to be given the dinner menu again! We were eventually able to get the right menus though.

2.) There are no condiments on the tables. Not a big deal in itself but when you only see your server once every 30min you realize how nice it is to have salt, sugar for your coffee, etc. Also note we were one of 2 tables in the entire restaurant.

3.) I actually made note more of when we placed our order and it took 1 hour for the food to come out. Most of the order was just eggs...

4.) Multiple orders were wrong! Some of the group I went with asked for things like no cheese or no onions but none of that happened.

5.) PRICEY! My order consisted of 2 eggs, 1 tortilla, a handful of diced potatoes and 2 strips of thin bacon. $11 easy.

6.) The server never returned...
 
Those were the main problems and as far as the food... just okay. Watershed has a lot of potential that they are doing nothing with. I don't see myself returning here again."}
{"text":"I was interested in giving this place a try because of the view and the fact that they are a GB Packers establishment. My first time eating here was terrible. My date and I waited at least 25 minutes for a bloody Mary, and an additional 50 minutes more for our food to arrive luke warm. I thought maybe this was an off day so I decided to give it one more try. The waitress was definitely nicer and more engaged but again the food arrived cold again. It wasn't even busy so I'm not sure why this happened. I will NOT be eating here again. Though I am interested in trying the Pier next door."}
{"text":"Wow, so disappointed! ! Was so looking forward to a good meal with a water front view.  What I got was a booth with a view of a wedding reception. Anyway, we were not starving so appetizers were our choice.  We had chips/salsa/queso & bruschetta. First it was all flavorless, not a drop if spices or even salt. The bruschetta was prepared on bread halves, too large for an appetizer.  My hubby ordered Arnold Palmer tea and got unsweetened tea with straight lemon juice poured in.  So bad!!! It took forever to get our appetizers, they came out 10 min apart. It was not even that busy for a Thursday night.   So will not cone back!  The ONLY saving grace was our waiter Ray!! He rocked!"}
{"text":"The view is great.. The food is good but cold by the time we got it.. The service is UNBELIEVABLY AWFUL.. It's not as though the place is heaving with people.. in fact it's pretty slow and quite.  But waiting for 15mins before you even see a waiter - then another 15 to 20 for drinks - then wait for food - then AFTER we finish our breakfast they bring the toast they forgot(?!?) - and finally waiting 15 mins just to ask for the check.. NOT coming back anytime soon.. Sad as it has the greatest potential!! Oh and I forgot to mention when they brought out the food to the table next to us and THEN told one of the people that they are out of wings (I guess that's what he ordered) and that they could make his second choice quickly.. WOW just awful!!"}
{"text":"We live right next to this place and this restaurant has always showed us great service and a wonderful time! I will definitely come back here again for the great cocktails and amazing food!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Awesome staff, drinks, and food! Awesome ambiance on the lake. I love watching the sunset from their booths or the patio. Love the live music, too! :) One of a kind place here in the valley!"}
{"text":"I went to the watershed for a bridal shower recently and I have to say the atmosphere is great.  It is right on the water, in the middle of Tempe's Lakes neighborhood.  The view is beautiful and they have a private room in the back that can hold up to 50 people.  
The food was simple, sandwiches and fruit, but it was a lunchtime shower so it was perfect for a shower.  They have a nice grassy area on the patio where people can play games or just sit by the water.  All in all, it was a nice place"}
{"text":"We went here for a wedding on Friday night and it was very nice.  I didn't expect much from The Watershed, as this has been several other unsuccessful restaurants relying simply on the lake views to bring in customers.

Watershed is different; and, although I only had the wedding meal, it was prepared by The Watershed kitchen and was very good.

The bar is great too, it is very large and has some great bar tenders to serve you.

Of course, there is always the large patio in the back that sits above the lake and is very nice to relax and have a meal, or just a drink.

Go and enjoy the sunset over the lake, which is an uncommon experience at a Phoenix restaurant!"}
{"text":"Hi, I'm Alex. Thank you for reading my review. I'll keep it brief. 

Parking spaces? Skinny. 
Music? Yes, live. 
Bar? Yes. Pony right up. 
Pool table? Yep. 
Waterfront view outside? Of course. 
TVs? Yes. 
Food quality? Good. Not insane. But good. 
Service? Fast. 


We brought a group of 20. The staff went out of their way to put tables together for us. Give this place a try."}
{"text":"Ambiance is neat but the food was bad. They have a limited menu. The pretzel bites came out burnt, the queso that accompanied it wasn't melted but rather a clump of gooey cheese. The food we ordered came out cold and the service was SO painfully slow!!! We definitely won't be going there for the food ever again, just the patio when the weather is nicer."}
{"text":"It's one of those places you just have to love because the atmosphere is so relaxed and enjoyable with a remarkable decor. The food was good, nothing spectacular and drinks were decent, but that view will take me back there again. Nice crowd also!"}
{"text":"I came here today for brunch with a friend and her dog, we invited several others with their dogs. I didn't make reservations because of the number of people who are prone to flaking out at the last minute. From the start I found EVERYONE to be very accommodating and kind. A few in our group got a little bit pushy about meat in a breakfast burrito but our server Stephanie didn't flinch at all. She was very kind and made sure to make her guests happy. Beautiful setting right along the lake. Can't wait to come back for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I love this place! With that said I love the ambience (the patio is awesome). However, every time we have gone here we have had an issue. It could be long waits, not having our reservation, cold food. With that said, they have always fixed the issues and have always been very professional with regards to dealing with it. I am very hopeful that this place will only keep getting better."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this for quite some time. Came for brunch and it was phenomenal! We will definitely be back when the weather cools down and enjoy the patio! Food was wonderful and the Mimosas were fabulous!"}
{"text":"I chose the Watershed this weekend for Brunch as a result of a Groupon that was recently offered.  Several months ago, another friend and I had visited this spot for dessert and coffee and at that time I was impressed by the atmosphere, friendly staff and tasty dessert offerings.  So it seemed the perfect place to gather with a couple of other friends for an informal birthday get-together. Unfortunately, my previous pleasant experience was not duplicated today.  

We requested outdoor seating to enjoy the cooler weather and were looking forward to hearing the sounds of nature during our conversation. Instead, we were treated to the thumping bass line of the stereo blasted from speakers hanging above every outdoor table.  Despite asking THREE times for the music to be lowered we never were able to hold a conversation in anything other than raised voices.  Outdoor, waterside, Sunday brunch is not compatible with a nightclub music mix, in my opinion. 

Although the food was of reasonable quality, it seemed overpriced. There was nothing noteworthy about it in terms of originality of flavor or creativity in presentation.  I could have spent half as much money on a similar breakfast at Denny's and gotten comparable food.

The wait staff was attentive as far as taking our order, getting the food to us in a timely manner and keeping our beverage glasses full.  The decor was inviting and beckoned the patron to \"come in and stay awhile.\"  Unfortunately, the noise drove us away and the food did nothing to compel me to return."}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant is terrible.  It's a shame because the spot has massive potential given its location alongside a beautiful lake.  Unfortunately though, this restaurant will leave a bad taste in your mouth (literally and figuratively).

Do yourself a service and avoid this place altogether.  If you are looking for a place to eat while enjoying the view of the lake, head over to Pier 54 right next door.  It's about average but the food is far better by comparison."}
{"text":"Fiancee took me here for Happy Hour and we were very impressed.  They have cool cocktails and the atmosphere is chill. The night we were there they had live music. Ordered good size hamburger ...it was tasty. Only Downside to this place is patio didnt have much shade. So they need to buy more umbrellas. Location is right off man-made lake so very nice view."}
{"text":"Live in the neighborhood and i dont know why we continue to come this place, everytime its a disappointment and i need to give my business to other local restaurants.  This place is way over priced for the food. Today I will have to say will be my time ever coming here. The place was not that busy, we waited 10 mins for our server, then 10 more mins for us to get our water. The food was cold and we waited 30 mins for that. The pasta was not worth $16! I could have gotten better pasta from olive garden. The waitress never refilled  our waters, sitting outside in 80 degree Az weather, you get thirsty and your server should always be checking your at least hydrated.
I also ordered an ice tea which i never got. Then i had to chase the busser to just get some water. When our server finally came by we asked for the check and before i could get my card out she took off.. now we have to wait to cash out. Waiting, waiting, finally cant wait no longer walked to the bartender and asked if someone could just cash us out. He said i need to get your server, i said look we have already waited long enough and he just leaves.. horrible service,  over priced food for just edible enough to eat"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  The Mexican Eggs were fabulous...we split them up as an appetizer so everyone could get a bite.  And the Carne Adovada was fabulous. With great food and a beautiful lake atmosphere I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great food, great service (Jordan is amazing), and the views are awesome. Steve (the manager) is super nice and this is a must visit for valley residents. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"First time here, and the food was great. Had the hatch green Chile burger and it tasted amazing. The staff was great, very friendly and attentive. Then there's the view of the lakeside area. We came around sunset and the view was beautiful and was great to see while eating. Will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place because my fiancé and I love dining on the water, but we were pretty disappointed. I think it has potential but they're a little confused on their identity and definitely need to reconsider their pricing. Here are a few observations:

- Pricing is way too high. This isn't Scottsdale and it's not nice enough to get away with the high prices being located off of Baseline in Tempe. As soon as happy hour ended the bar cleared out and everyone went next door to Pier 54.

- The food is ok but the menu is kind of all over the place. 

- The place turns into a \"nightclub\" after 8/9ish on the weekends. That was an immediate turn off for us (and we're in our early 30s). It was pretty cheesy.

- Gorgeous views, but the weird uplighting inside the bar reflected off the glass and skewed the view.

- Bathrooms are awful. Both my fiancé and I commented on how you could tell they skipped rehabbing the bathrooms and how important that was in a new restaurant. 

- There is a cool pool table room in the back and games on the patio but no one was in there. I think this goes back to pricing and a confused identity. 

- Our waitress (I think her name was Bailey) was awesome! Very attentive and personable.

Worth checking out for the view alone, but without defining their identity and lowering their prices, I give the place 6 months to a year."}
{"text":"Consistently horrible food.
Edible but nothing special.
Sad cause it could be a great place!"}
{"text":"I was in Tempe and came here on a google search. I had such a great time and they were amazing. Great service and great drinks! I didn't order a full meal but the wings were crazy good. I thought the view and the bar were so cool. This is a local spot and a great place to bring family... but also a crazy fun place to bring the homies!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere with the lake. The food was a little pricey and the portions were small."}
{"text":"Had brunch with friends on Saturday. The environment is great! Service are excellent. Food is okay! And you even get the free boat ride."}
{"text":"Great place to unwind! Love the lake and how open the place is. Feels like you're right at home. Delicious food and great customer service! Also great place to have a function! Patios for days! Wanna take a ride around the lake, they got it! Thanks for a wonderful Cinco de Mayo party you guys!"}
{"text":"5 stars for the pontoon boat ride alone!!!! Plus the awesome staff. Captain James took us all along the lake and shared tidbits of info about the area. The general manager Steve was super helpful,  funny,  and does magic tricks!!!!!! Seriously, he did a mini show for our group after we got off the boat. 
Ride is $5/person, no drinks allowed. It's super relaxing and seriously something I'd do again. You might need to reserve in advance if you have a big group. 
The bar has good drinks. We didn't eat there this time around."}
{"text":"Very unfortunate.. My wife and I have really tried to like this place... The food is decent but the seeming uncaring and lack of attention by the staff is very disappointing. For the price pick anywhere else!!0"}
{"text":"Try the Green Chile Meatloaf Double-Double Hamburger while having great service.  Hadn't been here in awhile and other than for the view didn't think we were in the same place.  Great food, drinks, and service.  Make sure you take a boat ride and check out Christmas Island.  Yeah - on top of all the other goodness they have a boat to take you on \"The Lakes\". We will now become regulars."}
{"text":"The food was really good for the prices. I got the Guinness trip tip dip and green Chile fries and they were both really good. The beer selection is great to and this is literally the first restaurant I've ever been to that has Hamm's. Great view and atmosphere, live music was fun. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Beautiful peaceful location. Great place for adults. Nice view of the water. Great selection of beverages and food. Customer service was excellent. Totally recommend sitting outside on the deck overlooking the water."}
{"text":"I was upset when I arrived because a table wasn't ready per my reservation but the staff could tell I was upset and they quickly made accommodations for us. The atmosphere is absolutely beautiful, but could use music. The red sangria is delicious! Our waitress was SO SWEET and accommodating!!!"}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time and it was excellent. I had the Seasonal Berry Salad with grilled chicken. All of the ingredients we so fresh and the portion size was very generous. My husband had the meatloaf and it was also great. 

The view is amazing. They have a beautiful patio on the water. I would definitely recommend it even just for a relaxing drink in a perfect setting. If you prefer to sit inside the view is still very good."}
{"text":"Great food & great atmosphere. Love the views!!
This place is a regular for our family. The calamari is delicious!! Highly recommend this if you're looking for a fun date night or laid back family lunch!"}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed The Watershed yet? Let me fix that tout suite!

BACKGROUND

I first heard about The Watershed in 2016 when some friends took me here for brunch, and I've been a fan ever since.

THE WATERSHED

The Watershed is situated on a 52 acre lake with over 4,000 square feet of lakeside patio and a spacious interior that boasts lake views from every seat. 

Located in the Lakes community at Lakeshore Drive, south of Baseline Road (next to another patio bar and cafe, Pier 54), The Watershed is the patio-focused project of Valley residents Dan and Robin Scott, who opened their new cafe and bar of American eats on December 8, 2013.

The name, \"The Watershed,\" gets inspiration from the watersheds of the southwest. John Wesley Powell (the Lake Powell, Powell) defined a watershed as, 'That area of land, a bounded hydrologic system, within which all living things are inextricably linked by their common water course and where, as humans settled, simple logic demanded that they become part of a community.'

That's what they strive to be: a place where people come together to meet, to eat, to cheers, to sing, to dance, to rekindle, to relax and to revel in the moment.

THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE

I was surprised the first time I was introduced to The Watershed, because I had no idea Tempe had such a place.

The Watershed didn't look like much to me from the parking lot, but when we walked in, the view was outstanding.

Is it an International 5/5 Star view? No, but it's pretty damn spectacular, especially for Tempe.

I really liked the restaurant/bar too. It's all wood and it has a open floor plan, that makes the view visible from every seat.

The first time I came, I had the bloody mary and crab cakes. That's the day I became a fan. The experience was that great for me.

I've come countless times since then. 

I've watched the sunset many times, whilst having their specialty drinks, and eating the sliders and coconut shrimp.  

I've come for Sunday brunch many times. I love sitting on the patio, whilst drinking mimosas and eating pancakes.

It's also a fun place to just drop in for some fresh raspberry martinis and soft tacos, whilst watching live music.

I even enjoyed the lake boat ride one Sunday with Captain Doug.

The bartenders/servers have ALWAYS been FANTASTIC: Two of my favorites are Katie and Aaron, but everyone is 100%.

CONCLUSION

I openly admit having a bit of a crush on this establishment; mostly because I've only had positive experiences here.

The food is outstanding. The view is the best in Tempe. The service is always on point.

My only complaint is the mosquitos on the patio, so I bring bug spray.

5/5 RECOMMEND

OF NOTE

*Closed on Mondays.

*Sunday Brunch with Boat Rides.

*Available for special occasions.

*Plenty of parking out front."}
{"text":"Came for happy hour to sit on the patio, place was empty and there was not even any music. The food was okay nothing special. They didn't have the cocktail I ordered, the one I ended up getting wasn't so great. Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Good food! Nice variety of southwest comfort food. Live music is a nice touch, you can have a conversation without talking loud."}
{"text":"Headed to this place after picking up a friend from the airport after she had a six hour flight.  We just wanted to chat and have something light to eat.  As we both live nearby and I had never been to this place, we agreed we'd give it a shot!  We were hoping to sit on the patio. We were at first seated at a table in the bar directly in front of the stage.  My friend asked when the band would come on and the hostess said, \"about 20 minutes.\"  Well, we wanted to just chat (and not have to yell) so we asked if we could sit on the patio.  There were many empty tables but she said they didn't have a server covering that section. That's ok, me and my friend both worked in the service industry back in the day.  Unfortunate but understandable.  Our other option was to sit at the counter side by side and so that's what we did.  

I ordered the seared ahi alongside a salad and she got a burger.  When our food arrived, even just by my eye, I could tell it wasn't right.  I touched the tuna with my finger and I s**t you not, it was 10 degrees from frozen.  My friend recognized my body language but I didn't want to make our dinner a downer. She insisted on knowing why I wasn't digging in (we were both starving) and I said, \"Feel a piece of this tuna..I ain't afraid of your finger-germs.\"  She did and was like, \"OMG you have to send it back.\"  I really hate the buzz-kill of that scenario and said that I'd take it home and fix it some way.  I didn't eat a bite of it at the restaurant.  It seemed that this tuna had been seared hours before and refrigerated in a TRES-COLD refrigerator for minimally a couple of hours.  I rock at making seared tuna at home and order it all the time.  I know that it should be served immediately so that there is still some heat on the outside and the inside should be room temperature because the ideal way to cook it is to bring the fish to room temperature before the high-temp sear.  Her burger was kinda thin, came a little overcooked but she enjoyed it.  She especially liked the bun.  We agreed we would love to come back to enjoy cocktails on the deck but never for the food. Twas a shame because there was a nice monsoon lightening show going on in the distance.  Ah well..... just file this under the un-socioeconomically-challenged-people problems category."}
{"text":"Great spot to hang out with an old friend behind the bar ML. Great to see this spot is here for the long run! I recommend the meatloaf, it's fantastic. Drinks are on point too."}
{"text":"I took my family to the Watershed for brunch for a Pre-Mother's Day celebration and it was perfect. The set up for brunch was perfect and there is so many choices of delicious food! Not to mention we enjoyed a beautiful and relaxing boat ride after brunch, courtesy from Zack. The prices are good and the food is great! I recommend anyone to try out this beautiful location and enjoy some great food."}
{"text":"After seeing all of the great reviews on Yelp I was so excited to visit the watershed. Outside seating was beautiful, simply beautiful! The huckleberry lemonade was a fantastic drink! The problem with everything else! After looking at all the pictures on Yelp I was prepared to either try the nachos or the crab cakes because both look delectable. Unfortunately upon arrival we learned that they no longer serve the nachos and they have a seasonal menu, in fact, they will have four different menu's throughout the year for each season. No bueno! There was nothing on the menu that seems appealing, I ended up getting the grilled mahi mahi sandwich which was bland, very tasteless, and the herb potatoes were mediocre! So then I decided to try the jambalaya, big mistake, even worse the rice was mushy and again very bland. The watershed would be an amazing place to celebrate birthdays, holidays, or just hang out with friends, your husband/wife, or boyfriend/girlfriend,  it definitely has a great outdoor atmosphere but unfortunately you leave hungry, very hungry. In fact we had to leave and visit another restaurant just to actually eat a meal for the evening. I was so looking forward to visiting the watershed but it was very underwhelming!"}
{"text":"Happy hour pricing is very good with a nice selection of drink and appetizers for just $5. I was, however, disappointed with the Tri-tip sandwich ($15) that was supposedly a customer favorite but our server replaced it with the Italian flatbread with no questions asked. All in all, I would definitely return.  The view is beautiful and the vibe very friendly."}
{"text":"Today was my first time going to this restaurant and the only positive thing I can say is the patio area had a nice view. The most upsetting part is this is where we chose to eat on Easter, the kids were excited about a boat ride that we called in advance to make sure would be operating on Easter and were assured they would be.Yet, once there, we were told no rides were being offered because the manager wasn't there due to a sick child at home. Are you kidding me? A holiday and no other management? The food was at best decent and I found them to be pricey. A family of 4 was $82 not including tip for breakfast and drinks. Also I asked for a cup of coffee, waited ten minutes and was brought out a dirty cup that was less than half filled. My husband ordered a burrito and asked to sub out the bacon for tri tip. Well he gets his burrito and they put in bacon. By the time they remade it the rest of us were done eating our meals. To make it worse he asked for green sauce and they put red sauce, then they must have caught the mistake and poured green sauce over it instead of fixing their second mistake. I asked for an extra side of salsa for my meal and instead was given none at all. Had to wait once I asked the server and was almost done with my omelette before getting it. No offers or discounts were given for our terrible visit and of course no management to speak to about all the complications. Unfortunately IHop would have been a much better dining option. Beyond disappointing."}
{"text":"Steve, manager, assisted us in booking a fabulous party for my daughters birthday. He not only went out of his way to show us different spaces to reserve but during the party he ensured all our needs were met.  He was professional and the wait staff were amazing for our large party. Thank you steve!!!"}
{"text":"Thank God this place has a view/ambiance  that people would get curious about. We're surprised that with all the bad reviews that I read in this place how come the management is not doing anything to improve their customer service,  the food, the wait, why!?
We still choose to come to this place last Sunday, mother's day hoping that there's something special that they can do to & we really wanted to see ourselves if the reviews were really true or maybe people were just exaggerating, but no we experience the same thing. But in fairness our server is so nice & apologetic with everything that's happening his name is Brandon, he tries to accommodate us in anyway he can to destruct us from complaining about the situation. 
Sorry to say that this place is not commendable until they take care of all these negative reviews."}
{"text":"Great food and service- Janice was an absolute delight. We had the tuna salad and two fantastic martinis. We always love coming here for date nights!"}
{"text":"If you have time to kill this is the place for you.  They are trying to be innovative with Thur menu. And they will get there one day."}
{"text":"First time I have ever sent back all three meals. Waited close to a hour for our food to come out. Waitress informed us that all of the food had been waiting in the window the entire time because of a tortilla. Who lets scrambled eggs sit for a hour? Everything was ice cold! Charged $1 for bananas on my pancakes and got 2 small slivers. Some gross slime from a unclean grill on the pancake. Absolutely a horrible experience. All of us completely lost our appetite."}
{"text":"This is easily one of the worst run restaurants I have ever been too. It is in our neighborhood so I have given it several chances and it never fails to disappoint. The food is mediocre at best and the service is worse. The view is the only good thing about this place. If I could give it a half star I would. Don't waste your time and money at this place."}
{"text":"We came for breakfast and the ambiance was amazing! The lake view is great. The food was good."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and while the views and environment were very nice the food and service was extremely lacking. 

Main issues: Dinner served cold, very slow wait staff

We don't planning on returning and can't recommend the Watershed in Tempe."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for my first Mother's Day and we arrived 10 minutes early. We were told there was an hour wait due to the kitchen being backed up on a fixed menu. What is the point of a reservation if you still have to wait an hour. We didn't wait because I could only imagine the horrible service and other problems we would have encountered. Disappointing for me and embarrassing for them."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and view of the lake however the food is very mediocre. Seafood chowder was good but came out very cold along with the cheeseburger. Would recommend the chicken goujons!"}
{"text":"Came here for the scenery but the food is delicious. I suggest coming after 6:30 to enjoy the sunset and go on a boat ride."}
{"text":"We went on a Wednesday in a group of 5 with 2 dogs and Sat on the back patio overlooking the water. First, I love the patio and fact that they allow dogs!  Service was good as well.  Appetizers were great. Some of our entrees were average tasting.  

I'm ranking 4 stars because they were out of many many things on their menu."}
{"text":"Underused amazing locale! Amazing water views, classy patio - even includes corn hole - darts - couches - great happy hour 2 for 1 on Mondays! Great place!"}
{"text":"I'm not even sure where to begin. I made a reservation for 10 people for Easter Sunday then when I called to change it to 7 people, I was told they were completely booked so I showed up understanding that service might be a little slow. First off it wasn't busy at all, and service was absolutely horrible!!  After waiting 30 minutes in the sun for service, one member of our party went to find our server. That didn't even work. Another member of our party then went to speak with the manager. I should mention that we're now hot, aggravated and almost out of water/drinks. We relocated to a table in the shade and our food came out in a reasonable amount of time, so all was now good...or not. Two out of 7 orders were wrong. We decided to not wait for food to be reordered and just ate it. The food was actually the best part of this experience, other than our awesome bus boy! I wish I would have asked for his name. He needs to be promoted to server and the server released from her duties. The manager so graciously took 10% off our bill, which didn't even cover the cost of one of the incorrect entrees. But thanks anyway. We won't be back until this place is under new management and has better staff and service. I'm pretty sure every table on that patio had problems with their service and orders today. That's ABSOLUTELY unacceptable!!"}
{"text":"We came here last night for my fiancées bosses wedding reception. 
Now this place really is awesome. I didn't know what to really expect.
I do love how you can sit outside over looking the lake it's so peaceful
They also have a ping-pong table and a giant oversized Jenga!! Which hands down my fiancé and I slaughtered everybody in both.
They did a buffet which included House salad, coleslaw, chicken on skewers, pulled pork, ribs and Hawaiian bread rolls... Now I'm not sure if this is on the menu that they serve on a daily basis but everything overall was pretty tasty the coleslaw was probably my favorite thing out of everything other than Hawaiian bread rolls..
After dinner we got a boat ride around the lake. Which was included after dinner and wow it was so awesome so relaxing it was the perfect way to end this wedding reception we attended!
I definitely would like to come back here and try food on their menu and go on the boat ride again..."}
{"text":"Wife and I went to this restaurant for lunch yesterday.  I had the beef tacos and she the pork sandwich.   It was their signature dish.  For a signature this it was not good. It want freshly made. Seemed like a frozen paddie.  Some guys were at the bar dropping f-bombs which I don't mind but when the bar keep drops them, as he did.  Not good.  The tacos were ok but so overpriced. Save your money and taste buds and go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Absolutely love love LOVE this place! Just moved from the east coast and was looking for a good place to eat on the water. I found this place which offers great food, great happy hour prices, and brunch. Very relaxing atmosphere with a nautical feel almost like your on vacation. Also on Fri nights they have acoustic modern music. Michael the bartender is one of the best I've had since I moved here!! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"They have great selection of draft beers. The food is delicious and the view of the lake makes for nice sunset dinner"}
{"text":"Talk about a hidden gem!  Best place to enjoy a Sunday afternoon.  Great food and lake front view.  Boat rides if you go for brunch."}
{"text":"Used to come here years ago-when it was a different place. We came in for an early Mothers Day dinner (before 6). 
We were seated right away, as it was not crowded. The table we were placed at was not clean-has food crumbs on it. The waiter was a nice enough guy, but it took over 40 min to get our food and he only stopped by the table once to tell us it would be right out....20 minutes later we were still waiting. 
There was no bread basket and no offers of anything. Then, out comes the food. My son ordered salmon for $28. It was LITERALLY the smallest piece of salmon I've ever seen; maybe 4 inches long. We all just stared at each other in shock. Yes, it tasted good, but ridiculously small. I ordered a Reuben sandwich, which was pretty good-nothing special at all. It came with a handful of stale chips. My husband ordered some ahi, which he said was okay-tiny portion and certainly not a dinner sized portion. We only saw our server four times, to take our order, to tell us (after 20 min of waiting) that the food would be right out, to bring the food and drop the check. Again, nice enough fellow, but horrible service. WAY over priced for what you get. Sadly, we will never come back."}
{"text":"The sad part of this is that I HATE yelp, and I absolutely hate doing online reviews.... having said that, I felt the obligation to leave a review consistent with the absolutely terrible \"friday night idea\" my friend and I had.  Sorry Sean William Scott, I know you own this place, but your staff is terrible.

1.  I got insulted by staff because some popcorn spilled on the ground (umm you insisted we try the popcorn)

2.  I could literally hear your staff talking about the 7 pieces of popcorn on the ground, and how they'd have to clean it up.  The popcorn YOUR company recommended.  God forbid they have to use a broom and clean up 7 kernels or popcorn .

3.  Your food was bland, overpriced, and took literally 45 minutes to come out.

4.  One of your waitresses or bar maids or whatever literally said \"seriously how do you spill that much popcorn, are you f***ing kidding me?\".  Wow.  Just wow.  

Please stop serving popcorn at your bar if you're going to hold that against customers.

DO NOT EAT OR DRINK HERE"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I have been a few times with friends and even while in the midst of the renovation, I always have a good experience. The staff is professional, gracious, and courteous, and the views from the deck at sunset are gorgeous! I will be back - and soon! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I live in The Lakes and The Watershed is very convenient for me. I have come to The Watershed multiple times, at different hours to try the menu offered at that time, and every time it is nothing but a disappointment. Tonight my boyfriend and I bought two beers and the chips/salsa with beer cheese. First off, our server was very sweet and respectful, I had no problem with him! It's the quality of the food. The Watershed puts on a front that it is this finer dining restaurant with all its lights and tall ceilings, but the food speaks for itself. It's as bad as dive bar food and it has been every time I come here. I have had horrible flatbreads, breakfast burritos and now salsa and beer cheese. Our salsa is the type that is all watery with not flavor and the so called beer cheese tastes like ballpark cheese sauce. I want to like this place but it is not worth any money! :("}
{"text":"As I walked up to the Watershed on a cold, rainy Arizona Saturday afternoon, I was thrilled to see how much this place reminded me of all the cool Cape Cod restaurants I have ever visited.  (We made a reservation for noon, Saturday, Feb. 18th.)  As I walked in, the incredible smell of a Gold Canyon Candle wafted out from the women's room. It wasn't busy, so we were seated indoors facing the gorgeous lake surrounded by all the beautiful houses.  For anyone who has ever wanted an affordable water view restaurant, this is the place!  My sister lives in Half Moon Bay California, and they have ocean views all the time, and she fought us for the water view!  They also have great space for groups.   I thought about giving the Watershed a 4 star review, but as we were finishing up, our server asked us if we were there for a birthday.  We said yes, my twin sisters' 52nd birthday was the reason we were there.  They brought us two huge ice cream desserts!  I think we said at least 10 times we were so happy that we found this place!  We can't wait to come back and be able to enjoy the gorgeous patio overlooking the water!"}
{"text":"We were so disappointed by our latest dinner experience here. For the first few months that The Watershed was open, it was our favorite spot. The views, service, and food were all excellent. We love New Mexican food and they had the absolute best green chili chicken enchiladas around that kept us coming back. We moved away from the area and hadn't been in several months, but when relatives from New Mexico visited, we made the drive for dinner expecting all of the same things. 

We arrived to discover that several of the traditional New Mexican items that we had loved so much had been removed from the menu, including the enchiladas. Much of the menu had been redone, but we figured that we would find the replacements to be just as tasty. We were wrong. The food was mediocre and the service was very slow. There were a total of six of us and only two of us got what we had originally ordered. When I asked what the soup was, I was told it was a chicken bacon chowder, but instead received a meatball and macaroni soup, someone who ordered a side salad never received it, and three of the others had to reorder their meals multiple times because each time someone would return and say that they were suddenly out of it. The manager came over and offered to discount the meal. Our waitress also offered to not charge us for a sirloin that arrived after everyone else had finished their meal. She honored this promise, but we were all so disappointed by the service and the food that we will not be returning. We felt that much more could have been done and that the manager didn't follow through with his offer."}
{"text":"The watershed is a nice night time date atmosphere. We are enjoyed our meal, which was a whole lot of apps. We had the chicken lollipops which tasted great with buffalo sauce. The space is very open and even has live music"}
{"text":"The Watershed hosted our first anniversary party last night and it was a great success!  Owner Dan and event coordinator Hannah both possess the very important 3 C's of event hosting, they are Cool, Calm and Collected.  The event was mostly outdoors and the weather was unsettled but Hannah took the right steps to keep everyone dry and the party on track. The food and service were both top notch. The venue is beautiful and is right on the water at Tempe Lakes (Lakeshore Dr.). I would definitely recommend the Watershed for any type of event."}
{"text":"Lack of service, girl at the desk didn't know what she was doing. She did not post my reservation at all. I don't know if I will ever eat there. Like the entertainment. We waited for a hour and never had any one to get us drinks, Manger never did show up to us to see what our problem was."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing atmosphere. Very nice without being over the top. They have pool tables and other things to entertain yourself with while you wait for food, and the Lakeside view is beautiful. 

The staff is very friendly and down to earth. Ask for Aaron. He knows the menu and will tell you his honest opinion on the items. He also talks to you like another person and cares about your experience instead of acting like you're just another customer like most people do. 

Definitely recommend this place. It's easy to miss, but you'd miss out not trying it!"}
{"text":"Great place!! Great setting and fabulous service!  Go almost every week for Happy Hour. All should try this one!"}
{"text":"Great food, service & view. Love eating near the water. They also offer boat rides. Perfect weekend brunch place!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I love the scenery at atmosphere. The staff are very nice and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I was SO thrilled to try this place out last night, just for the simple fact that the venue was adjacent to a body of water and had white lights draped along their patio.

The location is really tucked into the suburbs of Tempe, so this isn't a place you'd randomly stumble upon driving by.

Live music at both the bar and the restaurant on Saturday night. My friends and I sat on the patio and we could hear both musicians playing over each other. Rather confusing...

Our server (Jacob) was soo nice and had a joking demeanor, but forgot if he had/hadn't placed our order! We tried jogging his memory with menu items and the joke I made, and he finally remembered he had. He also forgot my sugar for my iced tea. It was hard to get annoyed w/him because he was so friendly and apologetic.

I ordered the Mahi-Mahi sandwich and it was so dry that I took maybe 4 bites at most. The seasoning was great, but I just couldn't choke down the sandwich. Steak fries were tasty so I nibbled away at those.

All in all, it wasn't terrible but it wasn't anything so special that would drive me to revisit again. It has fantastic potential - I hope the owner(s) read Yelp reviews and use the feedback for positive change."}
{"text":"This place is a complete mess. Why take reservations when you can't even feed the paying guests? We came here for Mother's Day and it was ruined. Don't go to this place if you want a laid back brunch. Absolutely terrible service."}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars I would.  When we first arrived the host told us to pick where we wanted to sit while he awkwardly followed us around menu in hand. The first spot we picked to sit he proceeded to tell us that the table was too big for us. We wanted to sit buy the water and all the tables were \"too big.\" We then sat for twenty minutes without so much as a look from the waiter that passed us multiple times. It started to get cold so we decided to head inside and we let a hostess know that we had moved inside we then sat another 15 minutes before we flagged down what became our rude waiter. The food came quickly and it was HORRIBLE. We will never go back."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a delicious brunch on the Watershed open air deck. While sitting in the warm morning sun we enjoyed seafood chowder served ceviche style that had a great variety of seafood including lobster. For a sandwich we ordered pork BQ served with a flavorful coleslaw and crisp chips. It was large enough for two to share. Mixed drinks are their specialty and there's a great assortment of draft beers. Service was well paced and friendly. We'll be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been here for brunch a few times. I have rarely seen more evidence of mismanagement. Today it took over an hour, from ordering, for five people to get brunch. I have never been a stickler for quick service, good food takes time and busy kitchens are busy. 

Our food showed obvious signs of having sat under a heat lamp for too long. Eggs that were just overcooked, cheese that was just a little too melted. Even better when the over-easy eggs that were solid got sent back, the place ran out of eggs. 

One more time, just in case, the place ran out of eggs! During Sunday brunch. When they said earlier they they were sending someone to buy OJ for the mimosa we ordered we laughed and said, \"OK!\" 

They ran out of orange juice and eggs during Sunday brunch. We saw the employee running up after fetching the eggs, very legit...he bought a dozen (they still had two hours or so of brunch left). 

The guy who was apparently the manager, came over during the egg debacle and said they'd comp drinks and  the messed up egg meal and offered us a free breakfast coupon for later use. Apparently, they had a big wedding the night before and that messed up Sunday brunch. 

After we got our checks, he did comp the messed up meal and some drinks. He also gave us a coupon for a free appetizer. No return coupon for breakfast. No big deal, we won't be returning for breakfast or at all.

He then shot my wife a dirty look as we left...cause y'know we were unreasonable customers wanting food to eat and competent management."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed for the third time. My friend and I went there because there was to be live music. The music was nice and so was the crowd. The restaurant was nice and clean and our waiter was very kind. The food on the other hand was terrible. We ordered pretzel bites for $9 they came out look like they were microwaved from frozen and the size of a quarter dark brown extremely chewy and with neon yellow cheese to dip in. I never sent things back to the kitchen but we told him we were not going to eat it so he took it away. On the other hand we ordered the fish and chips the fish was nice it was battered with a different concoction and the tartar sauce was different but nice as well. We were excited to try the hickima Apple coleslaw. Except when it came out it was traditional coleslaw and which had no flavor and was wilted, we didn't eat that either. Our waiter took off the cost of the pretzel bites and we simply told him they were not good. He was a nice guy but it is such a bummer because this restaurant has such potential I have been there 3 times in the last 2 years and everytime its bad food. I would not recommend this place. Unless you catered from another company and rented it out for the atmosphere. Also pier 52 which is next door has very poor food as well. Once again it's unfortunate cuz they are cool places."}
{"text":"We rolled in with a group of 20+ and the staff was immediately accommodating and welcoming. They quickly moved tables on the beautiful patio so we would be shaded and together. The drinks were good and had a nice pour. We ordered a bunch of appetizers, my faves were the chicken skewers and the guac was good too. Everything was fresh and the service was spectacular! We will be back for sure, I'm so glad we got denied service at Pier 54 and ended up here!!"}
{"text":"Got the groupon. It was a nice day so sitting on the water sounded like a great idea. We sat outside but the sun was low and coming thru the covered porch and too hot so we moved inside. Got an awesome table with a huge window. Ordered a Diet Coke and the weighted pointed out it was Pepsi which I appreciated. When he came back I showed him the groupon and was hoping for some help on what to do. That's when things went south. Refill on drinks took 15 minutes. He did bring it as soon as the cold food arrived which I also appreciate. Food took for ever and came out cold. Pretty sure he left it up there while he ignored us. Another waitress brought it out. Never saw him again. Never checked in how the cold food was. We ended up only spending 24 dollars of the 30 which made the deal not so great. And can't really comment on the cold food cause I suspect if it came out fresh it might have been good. Certainly not a fan of how long it took to get cold food."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times and I want to love this place  since I live in the lakes.  Came in today with my dad who's from out of town. The weather was nice and perfect to sit out side. We walked in and asked to sit outside ( it was empty outside) the hostess left and never came back. We ended up walking ourselves out to the back and finding a seat only to be kicked out by the hostess because of a 'reservation'. I explained we were on a time crunch and wouldn't be long but she continued to kick us out of a table for two on an empty patio. We ate had decent service and decent food. What bothered me was that they didn't  accommodate us. As we left, we noticed  the table we wanted was still available and the patio was still empty.  I've worked in the service industry for 6 years and hate to complain because I know how it works, but this place needs work. Wish we would have went to the pier."}
{"text":"Had Mother's Day brunch, incredibly sad and disappointing. Had a reservation at 10:15, they told us the brunch/food wouldn't be ready for 30min. Why would you even take the early reservation?? The food was horrible, freeze dried eggs, (frozen) stiff/still cold pancakes, burnt chicken enchiladas...McDonalds has better food. After, they charged us for the drinks for the table next to us then couldn't refund the money. What a joke. Boat ride was pleasant but had to pay. Happy Mother's Day!"}
{"text":"Dined here a few nights ago. Such a great atmosphere with an amazing view of the water! My server Alyx was very nice and attentive. She recommended the Green Chile bacon cheeseburger  and it did not disappoint. You will see me here again!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here and we ordered the fish and chips.  Have to give the five stars on the dinner.  The atmosphere was excellent and love the soft music.  Service was great."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting my best friend from High school and he said that he was impressed with this place on the water. And he was right great people, great service we were greeted with a smile and we left with a smile. The waiter was very knowledgeable and had great suggestions. Meatloaf was great. The Mgr came over right away very nice. Vic Williams of the Chicago Williams'/.  And Opie Hicks"}
{"text":"I enjoy this spot for it's atmosphere. The lakefront wrap-around patio is great and they remodeled the inside which is gorgeous. Great craft beer and cocktail selections. We have been here a handful of times for lunch. We also recently had our wedding reception here and they did an outstanding job with service and catering. They gave us private access to the Captain's room (pool table, couches, flat screens) as well as the area outside with dart boards. They allowed us to decorate however we wanted, and set up an outside bar for our guests (which they suggested). Also allowed us to have our own music from a PA system that they provided. The server was very attentive and went above and beyond to meet our needs. The catered food was tasty and received a lot of compliments from our guests. It couldn't have been more perfect."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service and horrible food. Stay away. We live in the Lakes and have given this restaurant multiple chances to prove it self and it continues to disappoint every time."}
{"text":"A beautiful late  Sunday morning, an awesome setting  (on the water) and a neat looking restaurant. I have mixed feelings about this place. We were immediately and exuberantly greeted by a pleasant male host who was obviously a \"morning person.\" Our table had a lovely view of the lake. In less than 10 minutes our waiter appeared, took our orders and returned with our sangria. The calamari appetizer was excellent. Lightly battered non-greasy calamari, perfectly fried and accompanied by a marinara sauce. My husband ordered fish and chips and got two large perfectly fried portions of cod, fries, and really yummy coleslaw. The chef must have liked him better. I got the buttermilk battered chicken sandwich. Hubby thought I ordered something Cajun. Nestled on a wonderful looking roll with fresh veggies and fries Ithe chicken breast was dark brown, very crunchy and attempting to saw through it with my knife was difficult. Our waiter, Brandon, quickly reordered it for me. While waiting, I filled up on some of the best fries ever and sampled from my husband's plate. By the time the replacement sandwich arrived (cooked better) I was pretty full so ended up taking most of it home. Whoever cooked that chicken breast clearly should have seen that it was overcooked, but probably hoped I wouldn't notice it tucked into the bun. With everything else so good, this had a major impact on our experience.Service was good, and the restrooms were clean, but I'm not sure I would travel the 30 minutes to return. However, if in the area might give it another shot."}
{"text":"One of my absolutely favorite places in the Valley. Good food, drinks, service and most of all, it sits on the Lake. The patio is large with tables and couches. Highly recommend!!! Go for a sunset, you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Although I always read reviews before I try a new place, I will still try a place for myself and form my own opinions.  Unfortunately, we will not be returning.  We waited an hour for our table, went next door and had a drink, no problem.  We then waited an hour for our food that was cold and mediocre, at best!   The server did not acknowledge any issues and disappeared frequently, this being the most unacceptable issue. We didn't want to complain for fear of waiting longer. They had a private party on the deck and I am not sure if that was the issue - but looking at other reviews - I am not sure that was the problem.  This place has such potential but the service and the food will be its demise if it doesn't change!  I guess if you're are not on the deck, you're getting less of an experience? If the reviews change I will try it again but at this time, we are decided, we will not be back."}
{"text":"We live in the lakes community,  waited over 30 minutes for a BLT  with only 2 pieces of bacon. Incredibly slow service. Filthy women's restroom. With a broken toilet. According to the waitress they have been trying to get it fixed for over a week  Bread for a BLT should be toasted.  Terrible food. Terrible Service.  Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"The salmon dish was amazing. Love the view. Our waitress Zion was very nice and helpful. Excited for a boat ride!"}
{"text":"First time here. Been to Phoenix a 100 times, can't believe I have never been here before. Located on a beautiful lake, condos and apartments on three sides, restaurants on one side. Several sections including a large bar area with live music, outdoor deck on the water, and inside dining area with a view of the water. Very nice ambiance, great for events or a nice date night. Good food and good craft beer selection. Will visit again."}
{"text":"Been here several times, but first time on a Friday evening. Sat down at the bar and waited approx. 10 minutes for 1 of the 3 bartenders to look up and realize I'd sat down. Received my first beer and half the glass was head.  I then asked for a menu which took another 10 minutes to find. I tried the fish and chips, holy shit you'd be better off buying Gordon's frozen fish sticks! Came with slaw which was buried under the fish and at a very warm temp. Proceeded to finish my beer and food as I watched the 3 bartenders scramble around washing dishes and not taking orders. No smiles, not even any small talk. Finished off my beer and sat it at the front of the bar, it went easily unnoticed for another 10-15 min.watched several folks approach the bar to order and walk away after waiting for lengthy amounts of time without being noticed. The bar tenders were upset and making excuses amongst each other. Before I go on, what happened to the live music? It stopped abruptly at 7 pm? That's when the bar was full and ready to order more drinks and dance. I witnessed one bartender cut her hand open while washing glasses and still proceed to serve/ make drinks!!! I'm disgusted and wouldn't even consider stepping foot into this establishment ever again. Super sad when this place has so much potential! #barrescue!"}
{"text":"Love the watershed! It's a great place to sit back and have a glass of wine or beer with a great view."}
{"text":"We had a great experience at the watershed! The atmosphere was fun, the service was great, and the food was amazing! Our server, Janice, had us smiling the whole night :) Definitely order the spinach and artichoke dip when you go! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went to the Watershed on a Saturday afternoon for some cocktails and appetizers. Our server Aaron was very attentive and friendly! Everything came out in a timely manner. We absolutely loved our afternoon here, and invited more friends to join! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Omg!! Ambiance!!!  Fantastic view!!  Bring your friends, family, parties!!!! Amazing ambiance!!!"}
{"text":"First of all this place is beautiful! It has a awesome  Patio & lake view...they did Great on their remodel and set up.

My family and I had my fathers celebration of life here last sat.  It couldn't have gone better.  Thank you Sharmayne(Events Manager) for pulling everything together for us on such short notice...you and your staff did an amazing job!  My father was proud and I'm sure was having a Daiquiri with us all up in heaven that day:)

Thank You Again,

Jonathan"}
{"text":"I recently found out about The Watershed in conjunction with their Wednesday open mic nights, so I decided to go. 

The staff is friendly. The bartender, Alex, is personable, professional, and and very knowledgeable regarding mixed drinks and alcoholic beverages in general. 

Michael Loney, the bar manager; however, is the reason this changed from a 5-star to a 1-star review. As the individual in charge of the open mic contest, Mr. Loney has displayed a lack of transparency, a fiery temper, and perpetuated general confusion regarding the open mic contest. Two weeks into the contest he pulled Alex Hristov aside and told him he would be \"perfect for Sunday brunch\" and to contact him regarding that. After the winner was announced on July 1st (Alex Hristov), Mr. Loney provided no details whatsoever regarding the nature of the \"regular paid gig\" that Alex won. After multiple attempts, via text, to clarify the specifics of the paid gig Alex won, Mr. Loney responded with exceptionally disrespectful texts, telling Alex he has \"no idea what you're talking about,\" when Alex texted him a screenshot of The Watershed's Instagram post, stating Alex as being the winner of the July contest. He told Alex that the gig he had won was the Sunday brunch gig in August. 

So, according to Mr. Loney, Alex won the contest just two weeks into the month. This means he had people competing for another two weeks for no reason. Think about that. What Mr. Loney is doing is providing free live music, under the guise of an open mic contest, without paying these musicians, and without giving them any details whatsoever about the nature of the contest, or details for the \"winner.\" Alex has yet to receive any information regarding what it means to have won this \"open mic contest,\" and in fact, has received multiple disrespectful and unprofessional correspondences from Mr. Loney, who continues to ignore and belittle Alex, via text message. 

To be fair, because I am, the venue is amazingly beautiful. I would recommend going out back to see the beautiful lake, the island in the middle of it, and the amazing views--especially at sunset.

There are reasons this establishment has a SOLID 3 stars. If you read all 317 reviews you'll notice the same complaints: bad service, inconsistent food quality, poor food quality, and generally being understaffed. You'll also notice that the positive reviews mention all the positive things I already mentioned.

Amazing venue. Much potential. Underutilized assets. And unfortunately, poor management. Observing Alex (the bartender, not the July open mic contest champion), I would say he is much more qualified to be bar manager. He's young, personable, likable, social, good at his job, good at multitasking (partly due to the understaffing problem), and in my estimation, a superior candidate to manage The Watershed's bar, and hopefully, be the reason people post more 5-star reviews."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, beautiful scenery on the lake, modern and very clean inside. Adelle was our server tonight and she was the best ?Will definitely be coming back, fun place overall."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour or anytime, people are nice and don't care if your local or out of town, they welcome everyone the same. Good for a drink and a bite."}
{"text":"After reading all the yelp reviews I was very skeptical in trying the watershed. I was pleasantly surprised! This place was so good! Our server was awesome, the food and even the dessert! A manager stopped by to make sure everything was going well too. I love the decor and the overall feeling of being in the water. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"First time trying breakfast. I ordered Huevos Rancheros. First off it looked like some one vomited on it . The verde sauce covered the top of entire dish,was cold and bitter flavor. Had to scrape away nasty sauce to get down to the eggs.those were done correctly but again cold. Menu said it also came with diced potatoes . I saw none until I scraped more sauce away and there were French fries mixed in w beans at the bottom of this monstrosity ! I like beans but there were more fries that beans and it was laborious picking through fries to fork up a few beans. So dissapointing.  I like this place but the presentation of the dish would be more appealing if plated the classic way ."}
{"text":"Sitting by the lake outside was beautiful and relaxing, and the hostess and wait staff were very friendly. These two things were probably the only positives about this place. The food was nothing to write about, and the cocktails were water-downed and sugary. We ordered the seafood cocktail as an appetizer and you could tell by looking at it that it was sitting there all day - tasting it confirmed it as it was flavorless and dull in color. The gumbo was lukewarm, and tasted like it came out of a can. We were kind of shocked to see that shrimp was an extra $5 to add - doesn't gumbo usually come with shrimp? The tri-tip sandwich fell apart and was not worth $15. Both entree dishes were forgettable and way overpriced. The tables and chairs are cheap folding plastic material. The price is outrageous for the quality of food and decor. We don't mind paying $20 for gumbo and $15 for a sandwich, but don't make it look and taste like it's been refrigerated and reheated for days on end. 

I recommend skipping this place and going elsewhere. Sitting by the water is nice, but not worth it for the overly expensive food that is nuked in a microwave. 

This place has a lot of potential, but the owners really need to put in some TLC and revamp the menu. Sadly, we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"It's a real pretty place but the hostess and wait staff were not attentive my daughters salmon came out raw it took ten minutes for waitress to check on us she took plate back she got a new fully cooked portion but no silverware bottom line maybe a good place for drinks but food was overpriced I would have liked the patio it was supposed to be reserved a lot of the tables were empty though it's a shame wonderful view just a crappy restaurant"}
{"text":"so I was trying to set up a Birthday dinner for my wife. Had a party of 15 adults. I was told by the young girl who answered the phone they don't do reservations at this time, not even for a bigger group! Hmmm...  Not sure if I'm starting a new business I turn away a possible $600-$700 food/bar tab! I understand your inside isn't finished but if you tell me that on a Thursday there shouldn't be a problem with a group that size then just reserve for me so when guest arrive before my wife and I they have somewhere to sit!"}
{"text":"The views were great. Love the  location  . And The waitress was good. But our order took a long time and the salmon dinner was cold. the waitress apologized and offered to replace but we did not want to wait that long to.  Also the server could use some training. Carrying the salad under his arm was gross and setting down our food almost spilled our drinks. Hamburger was good."}
{"text":"The restaurant was beautiful and the wait staff for our party was amazing. Very very disappointed in the event planner. She  was stand offish, didn't communicate efficiently, was worried about another party, and wasn't prepared at all for our booking. However, the food was great and the overall environment was satisfying."}
{"text":"We came for breakfast right when they opened at 9 A.M. on a Sunday. We were seated promptly and our server came by to take our drink orders. That's the extent of our good experience here. From then on things went downhill. Our coffee cups came with cream but it took a long time for someone to get sugar packets to us. I looked at my coffee cup. The rim was filthy with what looked like dirt as I could rub a powdery brown substance off of it. I requested another coffee cup which came out with brown stains still on the cup.

I opted for the standard breakfast, with carne adovada. Unfortunately we were told that they ran out of carne adovada (AKA they did not prep any yesterday to cook for today). So, I opted for the chorizo instead. The breakfast came with 2 eggs, which I ordered poached. After a few minutes our server came by to say the kitchen has no way to make poached eggs right now. Really? I refuse to believe that they do not have a pot and water to boil in their kitchen. 

The breakfast, when it finally arrived, was OK, nothing special. The chorizo overall had good flavor but parts of it were looking overcooked and black. I do appreciate that they added 2 extra pieces of bacon to the meal to make up for the lack of carne adovada and poached eggs.

At $9, you are really just paying for the great views because you can find a better quality breakfast with better prices at Denny's. Let the diner beware!"}
{"text":"Nice place and looks great , it's on the water at The Lakes. 
Went for brunch on Sunday I had the breakfast burrito. It was great! Alexander was a great server. So glad we stopped by."}
{"text":"Quaint little place! Great atmosphere and beautiful view. Perfect spot for a date night, drinks and appetizers by the lake!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Service was attentive and friendly. Ordered enchiladas, very nice. Defiantly be back soon."}
{"text":"The Watershed has an absolutely beautiful patio and will transport you out of Tempe, Arizona. I suggest sitting out on the patio which is on a lake and is beautifully lit. 

Inside, you can watch a game (it is a Packers bar which, IMO, is its biggest downfall) and play pool, you can have the best of both worlds of impressing your date with a scenic dinner AND you can sneak some peeks at the game....you're welcome. 

I enjoyed some nachos, which were tasty, but I am unable to comment much on the rest of the menu as I drank my calories during my visit. 

New Old Fashion - this was delicious. I'm not sure what was \"new\" about it as it tasted like a perfectly crafted Old Fashion, so good I had to order two...

Grape Fruit Margarita - Also yummy, but it was a little too grapefruity for my taste. I would skip this if you are looking for a pretty classic margarita. 

Happy hour includes $5 drinks and food, so sneak in before 6:00 to get an amazing deal.

At the end of your evening, you can enjoy a $5 boat ride which lasts about 15 minutes around the lake. It is a very smooth ride, so don't be worried about drinking THEN getting motion sickness. The captain was great, very personable and was super easy going while we waited for our meals.

The servers were very friendly, but definitely a bit more relaxed. We waited a while for our server to return to order food and additional drinks. I wouldn't suggest coming too hungry as you may have to wait a while before you actually eat."}
{"text":"My wife and I just finished lunch at The Watershed. Her grilled cheese sandwich with multiple cheeses, sauteed onions and mushrooms and my Monte Cristo sandwich were excellent! The huge glass wall offered a gorgeous view of the lake.  The service was very attentive and the manager was very accommodating.  We will be back with friends!"}
{"text":"I am writing this from the restaurant. I made a reservation for this place because the location looked great, and I asked specifically for an outdoor seat for my birthday. When I walked in they said all the tables in the shade were booked even though I made a reservation and when I walked outside there were at least five tables open in the shade. We waited 15 mins for a server to come greet us, then another fifteen mins for water, then twenty mins for a coffee. The server never apologized for being delayed, and the restaurant had barely people in there. We had to go remind them about our coffee and for our water, which is ridiculous. The food came and I ordered the gumbo, which is supposed to be hot but it was barely room temperature, and my wife ordered a breakfast burrito, and even though it said she had a choice between red and green sauce, they never asked her what she wanted and made the decision for her that she will have the green sauce. Her burrito was also cold and even the cheese wasn't melted. Overall the location is great but the service is beyond horrendous and the management needs to do better training. What they really need is to have Bar Rescue come in with Jon Taffer and just yell at them. Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"The Watershed has a beautiful view of the lake and wonderful ambiance including a really mesmerizing fire pit and comfortable seating around the pit. My experience here was wonderful! Isaiah was my server. He has a refreshing personality and is very helpful when making suggestions. I had the House Salad which is fantastic!
I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service was slow so we only stayed for appetizers. They weren't busy so not sure what the hold up was. I got the ceviche which was OK. They had cucumber slices that I used instead of chips so that was nice. My bf got the pretzel bits and said they were really good. I'll go back and try them again. The location was really nice and chill."}
{"text":"Second time here, wasn't sure I would be back after my first experience.  Glad we made the decision to go back.  We love the location and uniqueness that the Water Shed has to offer.  Not many water front restaurants in Phoenix.  Under new manager Steve, and server Alex we had a great time and excellent service.  Seems to me the place might be turning around.  While the food was not anything to rave about, it was good and I'm hoping the changes for the better keep on coming.  The bonus boat ride capped off our dinner and the kids loved it.  We will be back."}
{"text":"First of all.  We almost didnt come here because of all of the negative reviews.  Secondly, this place is Fantastic!!   We made a 5pm reservation, traffic kept us a little late, no problems.   Its January, but we decided to sit on the deck, we were provided nice warm blankets to which the wait staff even draped over us,  show  me a restuarant where the waitress will do that for you....Heather was awesome!! Our friends caught up with us 30 minutes after we seated.  We had a nice IPA, and specialty drink while waiting.  No rush no hurry, had an appetizer, and another drink before dinner,  Jumbalaya was awesome, fish and chips were awesome, the full rack of ribs that my friend ordered looked like brontosaurus ribs from the Flintstones.  Part way through the meal, Steve came out and did some up close magic tricks with us...  amazing!!!  It was my wifes birthday, they brought out a brownie sunday...( I know everyone does that....) heres the thing, usually you eat the icecream.....not this time.  Brownie was phenomenal.  Afterward the four of us took a cruise around the lake in the pontoon boat.  Beautiful.   This dinner cost the same or less than a meal at applebees.  You want my tip.  Make a reservation, bring some friends, make a night of it.  We spent three hours having an awesone dinner, enjoying company and conversation, interacting with the staff.  Wonderful evening.  We were so impressed that we had to tell them we were scared to come out but were glad that we did!!  Will go back again and again."}
{"text":"Had Previously been to the Watershed 2 years ago and had a lovely time, as my review relates. 
 Decided to have an early mother's day celebration with family.  Made reservations on Tuesday  May 2, 2017  for a party of 8 on Saturday May 6, at noon.  Arrived 10 min early,  was greeted nicely by the staff.  While awaiting the rest of the party to arrive was greeted by the server  Cruz he offered drinks.   It took approximately  15  min  before he brought the drinks.  The rest of the party arrived,  they ordered water all around   taking another 20 min to obtain.
we ordered our meal that took 1 hour + to arrive.  Cruz came to the table 3x  to see if anything was needed  with out ever explaining why things were taking so long.  When questioned he said there was another large party that had also come in approximately the same time.   There were few other patrons in the restaurant.   After over 1 hour  the meal finally arrived  with several things missing.    
needless to say this was a very bad experience.   
Any restaurant should be able to handle  several large parties especially when they were informed ahead of time.  
I will not be dining there again."}
{"text":"Great food, service, and ambiance!!
Reserved my Birthday for 40 people with Hannah which she coordinated a set menu for our guests to speed up service. From start to finish this was an EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE! Tyler & Jake were our dedicated waiters for the night which didn't skip a beat! Steve the Manager insured me that all would be taken care of and even drove our guests around the lake in the pontoon boat! Spent the entire evening in a private room called the Captain's Lounge which had a fireplace, 2 TV's, pool table, and even a sound system that we connected with our cell phone to keep the guests entertained with our favorite music. 

Outside there was plenty of seating on the deck along with darts, cornhole and portable heaters to make everyone feel comfortable. Come around 5pm and wait for an awesome sunset.

The only opportunity we experienced were the bathrooms, several ladies complained that the bathrooms needed attention. 

Overall a great experience and we will defiantly be coming back to enjoy this hidden oasis in the desert."}
{"text":"What a lovely neighborhood gem. Great inside bar space with TVs showing the games. Great outside patio overlooking g the lake. Such a great place to see the sunset. Get there during happy hour as the deals are amazing. Tasty flatbreads, garlicky spinach dip and better calamari than many. Outstanding craft beer list and excellent cocktail menu. On a lovely fall night this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Word of mouth is the best (or in this case, worst) form of advertisement; after a friend had a less-than-stellar overall experience on Mother's Day, I refuse to patronize The Watershed. My friend wanted to give her mother a unique gift for Mother's Day and chose a brunch and boat ride at The Watershed. As they both live in the West Valley, they drove nearly an hour to share what they anticipated to be a pleasant day. They were seated among 10 other patrons, ate cold food that was not refreshed at the buffet, paid $48 per meal, and were told that the boat (which was advertised as part of the deal, free of charge, no less) was \"not electrically charged.\"

After explaining their disappointment to the manager and asking to speak with the owner, the owner refused to address them and the manager was not friendly and as an afterthought, offered a free boat ride at their next visit. After the unpleasant time spent dining out, my friend and her mother waited an hour before they were able to pay their tab, having paid the full amount, not receiving friendly or timely customer service, warm food, or a boat ride. As they were leaving, my friend saw other people taking a boat ride on the boat that was \"not electrically charged.\" Needless to say, this business does not deserve my patronage and I will spend my time and dollars elsewhere; I encourage the same of others."}
{"text":"Excited to try some new food and Allison is a rock star of a waitress. Got the asado burger and we are enjoying the all night happy hour drink specials. Thx"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for our anniversary and had a great time! The boat ride was beautiful and fairly priced. The food was good and came out quickly. The owner was also very nice and put our window shade up for us. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place cuz it's next to the lake. And they have boat rides for 5 bucks per person. Food is ok and drinks are a lil expensive."}
{"text":"This restaurant has really gone downhill in the last couple years. My favorite item, the mahi-mahi sandwich, is no longer on the menu. I had the fish and it came in rolls like small burritos. I literally got less than a tablespoon of coleslaw with it. So I asked for more and I was given a small plate full of coleslaw. However, there was barely a drop of dressing on it. It was more like shredded cabbage that you get in a bag at the grocery store. My husband has had the baby back ribs at least two or three times. He said they were absolutely terrible and did not even finish them. So unlike him. The waiter was new but needed much more training. He never even asked what kind of dressing I would like on my salad. Just brought a balsamic. That was fine but it was hardly enough. When I asked to get my side salad before my dinner he brought out the entree salad with chicken that my friend ordered. I told her to just start eating without us. I doubt I will ever go back there. I will also tell my other friends, who used to go there , as well."}
{"text":"Great view. $12 for a measured pour of Hendricks and Tonic. I must have had my tourist hat on."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now. The service is slow and the food is mediocre at best. I ordered their ceviche shrimp cocktail and it literally had one piece of shrimp in it that was cut up to seem like more. It tasted like they made it with tap water. It was extremely bland and not worth the cost. I will not be back and I don't recommend it."}
{"text":"excellent food, staff was extremely friendly, location was beautiful, and how can you beat the view? I held a happy hour event here for 20 people and we all had such a great time. I will be back many times, thank you all!"}
{"text":"Went on a date to the Watershed, and luckily we cared way more about the glorious view than the mediocre service. 

We arrived and got seated immediately by the wonderful hostess, who was followed by the owner's young daughter (cutest kid I've ever seen!). The hostess was wonderful and made sure to answer questions about the happy hour that was currently going on. 

Here comes the shit show.

After maybe 10 minutes, our server arrives looking as though she is in a huge rush when we are one of three tables in the whole establishment. My date and I order sangria, figuring it is probably fresh. Nope... Tasted like an alcoholic Shirley Temple, it was so sweet. Switched mine out for The Velvet Devil merlot, which was excellent.

We order chips and salsa, which came out cold, and finally when our server came back to check on us, we ordered our meal. Date ordered a burger, I got the Thai curry bowl with shrimp. Did I mention they take orders from their cell phones? I thought when we were ordering, our waitress was ignoring us. It was the most awkward interaction I've ever had at a place like this. Luckily the lakeside view distracted us enough to not give a shit about the terrible service. 

Food came out. Pretty good, not something to rave about. The Thai curry came with slices of tomatoes which I thought was a little weird, but other than that, I enjoyed the meal. After about twenty minutes, our server comes back and says to my date, \"oops, forgot to ask if you wanted ketchup,\" laughs, and walks away. Luckily he didn't but what the hell...?! 

All in all, a pretty awkward experience and probably won't be back. Get your shit together, Watershed. Way too gorgeous of a location to have mediocre service and food like this."}
{"text":"Heard of this place from friends at work! Gave it a shot I'm new in town so enjoying finding new places. Their salmon pasta is beyond amazing along with their fish tacos! The service was great and really enjoyed the ambiance of it all. I've heard the happy hour is good haven't Been there for that yet. The domestic beers were a tad pricey but in all I enjoyed myself as well as the dinner!"}
{"text":"Fantastic handcrafted drinks and delicious food! Fun atmosphere with scenic views of a small lake!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 2 stars for outdoor ambiance, period, though if you just want to get together with someone for drinks, it'd be fine. 
DO NOT go there for the food, or you'll be disappointed.

I have to wonder if the owner/owners would rather just have a bar, and begrudgingly decided to offer food, because they figured they had to.
The food is of the microwaved variety, and sub par at best. Yuck.

Take note, owners - please try to give a **** about your customers, & overhaul both your menu & kitchen staff."}
{"text":"The Watershed is an official packers establishment and we were excited to try it out.  Our party of 5 along with another party we're not seated even though there were over a dozen tables open in the dining area.  

It became clear that they were understaffed and overwhelmed, but instead of acknowledging the situation and apologizing for the unintentional wait times, the hostess refused to seat us because we didn't \"have a reservation.\"

Perhaps it was an off day at the Watershed.  We do not mind a wait list, but please be honest with your customers and take responsibility for understaffing."}
{"text":"We came here last night for a work happy hour. The view of the lake is absolutely beautiful and the atmosphere is great. They have a huge bar with a good selection of draft beers, scotch, and mixed drinks. The staff is very friendly and helpful. My one complaint is that the appetizers need some work. We had the nachos which was very plain. We also had queso dip which after one minute on the table turned rock hard since it was just regular cheese just melted. We tried their chicken skewers which were pretty good. I can't comment on their main course dishes because I've only had apps but I've heard they are great. Overall I really like this place and will be returning!"}
{"text":"We gathered a large party for my brother's birthday, Christopher waited on us and never skipped a beat. He really made the entire experience a win. Drinks were prompt all night and food was great! Really great place!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Such a neat atmosphere on the lake. You forget you are still in the desert! Our server was Isaiah and he was simply amazing.  Truly fine dining service. The food was awesome. We had the crab cakes, cod fish n chips, and chicken skewers to start which were all really great. For my dinner I had the shrimp penne pasta...omg amazing...one of the best things I have ever eaten. I don't say that lightly. I also sampled the the green chili enchiladas and those were delicious. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is close to my house so we've eaten there a few times. Every time the service was really s-l-o-w. Recently after we were given menus, the server didn't come by for about 15 minutes. Then it took about 30 minutes for our food, which was cold when it finally arrived. Then after we'd finished the server didn't bring our check for about 20 minutes, so we finally had to hunt her down. It took forever to get out of there. Worse, the food is pretty expensive but isn't really that good. The view of the lake is gorgeous and this place is conveniently located, but it's not very well run. You can buy a lot more for your money--and not sit around for an hour--at lots of other places."}
{"text":"This place is really close to where I live. Driving or walking by, I expected it to be really dated... however, it was not. It was nice and tastefully (mildly) upscale with modern appointments and decoration. 

The inside was beautiful, and the outside patio had a great view (though not enough light to eat by if you're there after dark). The service was a mixed bag... I mean, everyone was super nice and seemingly attentive, however, I had to ask three different people five different times for a set of flatware and a new napkin, and they only brought it after my food had arrived.

The reason I needed a new napkin was because when we walked up to the both, someone was cleaning it with just a dirty wet rag (Denny's style) and no cleaning solution. That is not clean, restaurants. If you're listening, wiping down a booth - the seat and then the eating surface - with the same filthy wet rag you carry around with you to dry your dirty hands and clean everything you walk by - is really, really disgusting.

Since the seat and table were still wet when we were sitting down, I just took my cloth napkin silverware burrito and used that to dry off the area... when I was done, I looked at the napkin, and it looked like I had just cleaned a dirty toilet with it. Dirty and gross. So that's why I needed a new napkin... 

As for the food, it was sorta meh. The cod bites were terrible - somewhere between overcooked and burned. They also didn't have much flavor. I suspect they needed to change their oil. Didn't much care for my fries either. My date had a salad - she said it was good. We both ordered special cocktails. They were okay. We didn't stick around for a second drink though.

It might have been an off night, but I suspect the wet rag wipe-down is standard practice (that they picked up in the 90s). Also, it wasn't packed, but I suppose it was busy enough that I should forgive them for not bringing a napkin quicker. I'm definitely going to go back and try again because it's so close, but my first impression wasn't up to expectations or hopes - not up to par with these prices either. Also, I used to live near British Open Pub, and their cod bites are the best, so I was hoping this could be a decent substitute now that I've moved to Tempe. *sigh*"}
{"text":"I have frequented this place a lot lately since I discovered that it's close to where I live.  It's a really nice looking place with a lot of room.  I have had two dishes from this place (tenderloin sandwich and fish tacos) and the food is just average at best.  I think some of the drink and food items are overpriced.  

However, the scenery is outstanding and the customer service has been great for me.  They also have some great craft beers on tap.  I would recommend that you sit outside on the water and get a craft beer during happy hour or reverse happy hour.  I will continue to come here because of the customer service, view/location, reverse happy hour, and quality craft beer.  It's also a nice place to play Cornhole outside."}
{"text":"Aaron aka Drake was awesome. First time coming to the watershed and he's was super friendly. It was great. Beautiful view of the water around sunset time. Come check this place out!"}
{"text":"Visiting the in-laws from out of town and came across The Watershed.  It's hidden in the middle of a bunch of homes and not in the middle of other restaurants.  We sat outside on an April afternoon and enjoyed the sunshine and the beautiful view.  Service and food was fantastic.  We'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"We have been here a couple times and there was always something that was missing. Either the service was bad or one of us did not like our food. Well last time was our final time to see if things have changed. The view and atmosphere inside and outside is so great....that we really wanted this place to do well. We were impressed last night! They had other reservations but they still were nice enough to seat us on the water like we requested in the reservation for open table. Great waitress, got our wine/beer immediately. Happy hour was $2 off wine. Got our app's right away and our entrees very fast! Nachos and Greek Pasta w/ Salmon were great. Something changed last night and we were VERY happy about it. They really redeemed themselves and I hope they keep up this service. Great job last night guys and keep it up so we can keep coming back here!!! ;)"}
{"text":"Isaiah is very knowledgeable and friendly. The hubs ordered chicken enchiladas that were amazing. I had old school pork tenderloin sandwich because it reminds me of Iowa. :) Apple slaw rocked and the space/atmosphere is lovely and full of various potential."}
{"text":"Cool, new place. Went here for the first time for a friend's birthday gathering. Plenty of space, good food and drinks, excellent waitstaff, and an awesome location. Reminds me of being up north on lake. We will be visiting again."}
{"text":"Incredible layout, great food & service! I highly recommend the panko crusted Fish & Chips! Fall is also perfect weather for a boat ride!"}
{"text":"This was an excellent choice for dinner tonight. I had the Gumbo and what's Gumbo w/out Shrimp? Exactly! You have to add the Shrimp, but It was delicious and the service was Great!"}
{"text":"We visited the Watershed originally for the nice ambiance on the lake. However, I left feeling energized by the positive attitudes, smiles, and great service provided by ALL staff members. The hostess when I came in was warm and welcoming and went out of her way to get us seated. The servers were all efficient and truly a team. The food was very good and there was a wide variety on the menu from full meals to wraps and burgers. There was also live music which was great but still allowed for conversation. When we left it was like saying bye to friends, even the general manager was out on the floor chatting with guests and staff. You could tell by the way he interacted with his staff the shared goal of the entire team is to make the dining experience great for their guests. Enjoy!!!!"}
{"text":"I truly enjoy venturing to new places and trying new things. Upon arrival, the area and space seemed modern and upbeat. The place wasn't very busy and the person up front was very kind and nice. We waited about 10 minutes to be seated, which is normal. However as we waited people passing by told us the food wasn't worth the wait. We kept an open mind and waited. We were seated by the lake, which is a nice view. Server was kind and friendly. However, the food was a very long wait. On top of that, the food left much to be desired. Underwhelming and bland, not worth the price. As we were eating, a server was complaining loudly about her home problems, killing the vibe. 

TL;DR
Service ok. Food bland and not worth it."}
{"text":"The only thing I liked about this place was the view! Awesome view of the small-sized lake. Very peaceful. When we entered the restaurant it smelled like raw sewage. Yuck! The service was super slow (& it wasn't even busy.) The food was nothing special, and the cocktails were disappointing. We took a little boat ride around the lake, so that was relaxing, but pretty short. We will try the place next door, next time. Same view."}
{"text":"The Watershed would be a great restaurant if they replaced some of their staff, which is why I'm giving it a 2 star review rather than a 1. 

The planning process seemed to go okay at the beginning, but then The event coordinator did not show up to our meeting to go over day of details. She then had the audacity to completely lie and say that she was there even though the owner, bartender and waitress all tried to call her. She then said she did not have an appointment when we spoke on the phone which we were able to prove with her email confirming the day and time. I'm not sure why she wouldn't just apologize from the beginning instead continuing to lie. 

We held our event during the day on a Saturday and the restaurant was not busy yet there was no service. Each platter of food that was brought out had no serving utensils. Even after asking for some our food still had nothing to serve with. All our guests had to go to the bar every time they wanted a drink. After the event we were asked if we needed help after everything was already done and to top it off the staff was rude to several of our guests. 

Overall a bad experience and I would not recommend using this venue to hold an event."}
{"text":"The location of Watershed is unlike any other you will get in Arizona. It's on a lake! That's hard to find around there. Also, there's a ton of different places to sit! There's even a room with couches and a real fire place. However, our waitress wasn't the best. They weren't really busy, so I was confused why she never checked on us. The Bart we, Neli, she's super dope though! She took care of us because our waitress never came around. I love the Vibe of Watershed, though. Plus, they have super cool events like yoga and margaritas. Doesn't get any better than that."}
{"text":"Yeah... the food is pretty terrible, but the view is nice. The waiters were really nice too. But my dish was so bland and disappointing, I didn't even eat half of it. I hope they work on their menu for the future."}
{"text":"This place has really good fries  and the ambience is really good. NEVER EVER TRY THE BUTTER CHICKEN SANDWICH. Its the worst thing to buy it in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Drinks were great. Lake atmosphere was beautiful but service was slow and food was meh. I had tacos, husband had burger. Nothing was bad but it wasn't great either. Would definitely go back for drinks /happy hour when it's not so hot out. Patio is nice and it's not filled with smokers like pier 54 is right next door."}
{"text":"Great location- definitely a \"must\" for a happy hour during the months when you can sit outside. Service is OK, we had a large group but the rest of the place was fairly empty. Drinks took far too long to arrive given how few other patrons were actually there-when you've got a happy hour you need to make sure you can get drinks out."}
{"text":"No need to get a reservation, it means nothing to this place, you will still wait an hour to be seated. We walked out with no hesitation."}
{"text":"I've been 3 times now becasue its close to home and very comfortable and the food and drinks were really good. So we thought stopping in on Valentines Day would be okay for a quick drink and bite to eat. NOT!  Get there at 5:20ish, only a few couples on the patio (20% capacity).  The hostess stops us and askes if we have a reservation, I responded \"No\", she then said it would be a few minutes.  Ok.  The place is practically empty, it's been 10 min, a waitress we had the week before says sorry to us and that she's not sure why we can't be seated.  Other couples walk in, no reservations as well and hostess tells them it will be a few minutes.  She then looks at me and says it'll be awhile, what happened to a few minutes?  Did I mention the place is practically empty?  No bar, still being built and can't even get drinks to wait.  I send my boyfriend next door to Pier 54 (which we frequent alot) to look for an empty table, which he calls to tell me he finds.  I then look at hostess to tell her not to bother, we have a table next door adn walk out.  We end up having a lovely evening on the water, live music and Great Service.  Not sure why the Watershed hostess was rude and doesn't know how to organize the timimng of occupants to tables.  She kept saying everything was reserved.  Sitting next door, we watched the onslaught of reservations for the Watershed arrive only for them to not find parking and it was close to 6:30pm.  We could have been in and out in that one hour.  I've had other resurants inform us their busy, but we could have a table if we finished before the next reservation time.  No such thing offered here.  It's back to Pier 54, who is reliable and hires qualified staff."}
{"text":"Came here during the sunset. My friend and I sat outside to enjoy the view (what a view!) And the sunset. Our server Lora (forgive my spelling) was very attentive to our needs and had a very welcoming demeanor. It was my first time here and I have lived in Tempe for 15 years! It's truly a gem and will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Horrendous service. Food took over an hour and then was cold. Our waiter was disrespectful and was more interested in the 3 girls at another table than serving us. He then proceeded to take the girls on a boat ride. Never again!"}
{"text":"And it's a Packer Bar!
Everything you ever wanted in a bar and restaurant.  A vast selection of ice cold craft beers, scrumptious appetizers, burgers and salads.  All in a room with a view.  Nothing more to ask for here, except to be served by Michael.  That long hair, bearded, pot bellied bartender is really is nice guy.  This time I mean it.  Sit back and enjoy the game!
Aaron Rodgers is sorely missed.  The beer is still cold!"}
{"text":"Came here at the recommendation of one of my employees who thought this place would be the perfect spot to propose to my girlfriend. This was without question an awesome spot. The views were great and inside and outside are up kept very well. The staff went out of there way to make it an amazing experience we won't forget. She said yes by the way ;). 

Now for the food, I had the chicken enchiladas in red sauce wth a side of beans and rice. The sauce was spicy sweet, reminded me of mole sauce. I enjoyed them. I also tasted my sister's nachos and liked them a lot. My girl had the salmon wrap with kettle chips and she enjoyed it. Everyone at the table was satisfied."}
{"text":"The Watershed has a lot of potential with its cool location and layout. Right now it is far from where it needs to be. At this point, a small area inside the building and the patio overlooking the lake are the only areas that are open. Eventually they will have seating for probably double what they have now. 
The service was full of ambition but utterly lacking in execution. They use a phone app to communicate orders between the servers and the kitchen (which is also where drinks are produced from). The problem is they are apparently unreliable. We had a good sized group of maybe a dozen and several people's orders never came out after waiting a good 1/2 hour at which point we were able to get someone to acknowledge it and they sincerely apologized and were willing to comp some stuff but it needs to not happen like that. 
Having people wait for 45 minutes to get a drink (and theres no bar, so you dont have an option to get it yourself) is unacceptable. I really want to see you succeed but whether its understaffing or undertraining, the service issues certainly need to be corrected before you kill your own reputation."}
{"text":"Must have come at a bad time

Service was lackluster, couldn't get them to care for our group despite being one of only two tables being waited on. Beer was cold at least 

The Chicken was over fried and dry. I'm not a picky eater but they fried the heck out of that poor sandwich 

Boat ride around the lake was cool, definitely the better part of our visit."}
{"text":"Awful!!!!. It could be a great place because it's very pretty.    There were 12 people in the place and we were told we had to wait 35 
Minute wait because they didn't have staff.   This was our second visit. The first visit  isn't worth mentioning except for saying the Service was horrendous but we wanted to give it another shot!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for a friend's birthday last night. The patio and the view are really pretty . Food was just ok,  service was really good. It turned into singles night around 8 and thought it was kinda weird we weren't allowed to go inside on the dance floor since we weren't part of the singles group. Other then that check this place out around sunset so you can enjoy the view!"}
{"text":"Great view.  Cold brunch food for their Sunday brunch.  Jimmy was a good waiter but the cold icky expensive food outweighed his smile and attention. Website says they open at 9 am, made a 9:30 am reservation.  Closed until 10 am.  :o("}
{"text":"I had come here several times with family or my husband. It was always quiet and clean with a great view, so I decided to have a small get together with friends and family for my birthday last week.

I only ended up having a list of approx 10 people, but calling and asking for a table, the gentleman that answered acted like it was next to impossible, whatever I figured they were booked but he squeezed me in for 5-6pm arrival. My one friend arrived first, and the host acted confused and our table wasn't ready. My friend was worried and stressed about it but I shrugged this off too.

Service was slow and I let this go too, but beers came too late and we were excited to see a new menu thinking things would turn delicious. We were wrong when my brother said the salsa tasted like fruit place. No one at the table liked it, and when we explained that only the 5 of us would be dining and apologized that they set up a bigger table, they acted like they could care less. Looking around I was annoyed realizing there were about 4 parties around the whole place.

The server didn't know anything about the new menu, food kept coming late like the drinks, and splitting the check was a problem. Now I have been a server and bartender for years so I like to think I'm more than understanding, but when my husband asked for a propane heater they acted like it was an impossible feat and they were out of gas. Literally no one knew anything about anything. If it was busy it would be one thing, but now I understand why it's ALWAYS dead. I won't be back. I normally shrug things off but my entire party was annoyed and felt awkward... so frustrating."}
{"text":"Service is a tad slow because they are busy,  but the waitress, Latesia, was great.  She apologized and started the drink order.   The basil smash is a great drink. I ordered the green chili bacon burger and it was tasty.  My boyfriend ordered the cajun chicken and he really liked this.  Good view at sunset always with a cute patio."}
{"text":"Soooo.... I am stuck in two Seinfeld episodes at once at this place. The first one has to do with taking reservations. We have a 1215 reservation for mothers day brunch and we show up 15 minutes early only to be told that it is at least an hour wait because the kitchen is backed up... Ummmmm... Shouldn't they be prepared for a rush on mothers day, especially since they are booked on reservations. So now I feel like I'm in the lobby of the Chinese food restaraunt waiting for our name to be called. I can only imagine how slow the service will be if and when we actually get 
seated.. Avoid this place. The view isn't worth the incompetence."}
{"text":"Brought my girlfriend here because it looked nice from the outside and honestly...the yelp pics looked good.  As we walked in the door we should have known it was a mistake.  The restaurant was empty on a Thursday night.  We sat at the bar and the menu had 4 pages of drinks and 1 page of food with an average price of $15. Ordered the Ahi burger and fish tacos which were both burnt and cold at the same time somehow.  The food blew donkey chunks. We thought we were just picky lil beaches but the guy next to us was howlin like a dang coyote at how much his plate sucked.  Sorry Watershed....we know you tried but you can't charge that much for sub-par food."}
{"text":"Our reservations were for 7 and we arrived early so checked in and went to the bar. The hostess said she would text us when ready. We sat there for 7:20 then went up. She said she was working on the waiting list and deleted us. Found a table. This was 7:35. We ordered and then waited 55 minutes for our food. And the place was not packed. This was out of the ordinary but was annoying"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and a cocktail. The host was nice, the bartender was attentive and the summer beach feel radiated throughout the place. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty disappointing, this was supposed to be southwest chicken flatbread. The menu should describe the flatbread differently. The view is amazing, but it does not hide the overpriced low quality food. The server quickly offered to replace my item for something else on the menu, but how annoying to wait for the new item to come back. The Bloody Mary is $8 for half a shot of vodka and all tomato juice."}
{"text":"The drinks were yummy but the food was not seasoned at all and a little bland. I wouldn't necessarily go for dinner again but happy hour or just drinks w friends I would absolutely go! Ps- GO AT SUNSET! They do pontoon rides around the lake which is super sweet and romantic but as for the food... I got the meatloaf w garlic mashed potatoes and the veggies. The veggies were good and seasoned... But where was the garlic in the potatoes?! The meatloaf was yummy w BOTH sauces on the side but I had to ask for salt and pepper to season everything. The service was amazing though! Sweet waitress and great location."}
{"text":"Made a 9 30 brunch reservation for Sunday. Got to the door and the hours sign said it opened at 10. Tried to call the number on the website, but no one picked up. Tried the door and it was open, but the place was empty. Minutes later a waiter lead us to a table. We were told that the only breakfast or lunch option was a buffet. No price was given to us, not even menus. We had to wait 20 minutes for the buffet to be ready, and when we got to the buffet l, all the food looked raw and not appetizing. Plates were also still wet, hadn't even been dried off. We get back to the table, and the food was ice cold and undercooked. We asked for the check and was surprised to see it was  $20 a person. Ridiculous. Paid $100 for five people for gross food. Very disappointed. Our server was kind but the lack of information about the price of the buffet and the overall lack of enthusiasm of the staff made it hard to feel welcome in an empty restaurant and did not want us coming back for more. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant about 4 times.  It is a great location, right on the water. A novelty in the Phoenix area. The inside has a nice modern rustic feel.  Upon each visit the quality of service and food seems to be declining each visit.  I really enjoyed my Guiness \"French dip\" (they have a different name but this is basically what it is) on a previous visit.  They changed it and not for the better. It is now served on a very soft brioche bun not conducive to dipping and there was something else missing I just am not sure what that was.  I was really disappointed.  Neither the runner or our server had been there longer than a month to know that it had changed.  The service was very slow.  Our check had to be corrected twice due to incorrect charges. They did correct their errors but attention to detail would have avoided the situation.  On a positive note my husband did enjoy the green chili meatloaf.  I want to like this place but I don't know that I can give it another chance."}
{"text":"Bobbie is our server and very attentive. The drinks taste fabulous. The food is great happy hour food. What I like about this place is how accommodating they are for our ever expanding party. They are keeping up the service and the live music is awesome. Shake and bake!!'"}
{"text":"You can't beat the location! I recently cohosted an event for about 25 guests here. We reserved \"the lawn\" which is an AstroTurf covered section of the patio overlooking the water. It was adorable and perfect for our event. The GM was extremely accommodating of all our special requests including guests with specific food preferences and allergies. Our party had ample staffing and every one who we came in contact with had excellent customer service skills and treated our guests to prompt and efficient service.  We had a limited menu that mostly included small bites, desserts, and drinks. Everything I tried was fabulous including the sliders and bruschetta. They also had a great beer and wine selection and from what I heard made excellent cocktails for our guests who were enjoying them. 
My team hosted an event inside the restaurant earlier this ear which included plated meals from a limited menu. On this occasion the food was great, however the service and leadership were clearly lacking. We decided to give it another try anyway and were pleased to find a brand new staff and a new GM for our second event. To top the night off the GM came out and offered to take our guests out on the boat for a tour. If you been here before weren't impressed, give it another try! They have really stepped up their game!!"}
{"text":"The Watershed is perfect for an intimate, elopement wedding! We couldn't be happier we had our Civil Wedding here. The view was beyond perfect, the food is great, and the people are friendly and kind! Props to Ms. Sharmayne Maytes, the event coordinator at The Watershed, for working with us on our wedding day. She answered our queries, made suggestions that were very helpful for us and always there when we had questions or favors.

During the wedding, everything turned out the way I hoped for, Sharmayne helped me put up the designs and took care of the plating exactly how I wanted, the food was great, although it took a while for them to serve all of it, it was delicious nonetheless and most of all, it was affordable. The best part of this though, is the scenic view The Watershed offers. My husband and I had the chance to go to the island to have photographers and it couldn't be more perfect. The Lake as a backdrop was just breath taking. 

We first went to The Watershed on  Valentine's Day, and when our initial plan for the wedding didn't work out, we immediately thought this is the perfect place to have the Civil Wedding, and we did not regret having our memorable day spent there.

Thank you to Ms. Sharmayne and The Watershed, we will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"The watershed is wonderful! The food is great, the view is spectacular!! Service is phenomenal!! Especially Jordan!! Ask for him! Great place for day drinking!!"}
{"text":"We've come here twice now, and have walked away thinking that the place has so much more potential than the product they put out. The view and atmosphere are great, but the food is embarrassingly bad. Both visits have brought meals that look like they came out of a freezer 10 minutes ago, and this most recent lunch was just ridiculous. I ordered the turkey pita, and immediately recognized the pita, sliced turkey and fries as the exact same as the packages I have at home from Costco- the only difference is that I don't have the audacity to charge $11 when I make the same sandwich at home.
In all, a $70 lunch with tip should bring a better result than everyone looking at each other and saying \"nice view, but let's check out the bar next door the next time\"."}
{"text":"Invited by a friend for Les iz more. There were about 20 of us in the bar. We pulled three tables together. The head waiter came over and told us that we were omitting one seat per table by pushing the seats together. We recommended that he course how many ppl were sitting at the tables and re-evaluate. He was not able to sway us and left in a bit of a huff. Second issue-I ordered a marguerita .... It was served in a plastic glass! A full service bar on a Saturday afternoon and plastic glass .. I asked for and was provided a glass, but was disappointed in presentation . Had the crab cakes - good. served on a bed of lettuce with a nice sauce.  Service was efficient and our large group
 was handled well"}
{"text":"Terrible service and always out of drinks. It's kind of sad because it's a beautiful area and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is relaxed and views of the lake are beautiful at night.  Staff was friendly and the food was delicious.  We went on a Friday night and it was a wait to get seated but we had made a reservation online and were seated immediately.  Very enjoyable dining experience.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The watershed is a hidden gem for sure! Located near the lakes living community it is in a quiet and residential area away from traffic and distractions. PERFECT for sunset dinners and even better for lit up dinners after dark. The atmosphere is dreamy and very romantic. Great for a first date or rekindling an existing one. Lovely lovely atmosphere. The food is great and made to order. Not disappointed at all."}
{"text":"Can't speak for the food but the beer and service here is amazing. Especially the service. Everyone is friendly and brings drinks out fast. Shout out to Steve. Not sure if he's the owner or manager but he remembers names and keeps all parties entertained with some magic tricks. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Amazing tri-tip sandwich and the seared ahi salad is amazing!!  Beautiful setting and perfect for our awesome AZ weather!"}
{"text":"I am updating this review as the highly sensitive owner of the Watershed took the time out of his day to send his response to my Yelp review.  Enjoy!  

__________________________________________________________
 

Hey Brett,

Dan Scott, the owner, here. Thanks for taking time out of your late Saturday night to review my soft opening. I reviewed your ticket and you paid for two glasses of wine for two people. We also comped your meal. And, as someone who has been in this business and the media business for 20 yrs, it's very unprofessional to review someone else's meal. Especially when we made that situation right and the client was in the end happy.

Do me a favor and forget we exist. 

We make everything from scratch and are working our tails off to make this a fantastic restaurant/bar and I know we'll succeed.  By the way, my assistant manager talked to you because I was off the clock from my 16 hour day and just started to celebrate my good friends engagement that had just transpired at my restaurant. My newspaper, (Weekly Alibi) has been doing reviews of restaurants for 20+ years and we have a policy of going to a restaurant multiple times before giving our review. 

I guess that's the difference in qualitative professionalism between real reviewers and the Bretts of the world.

__________________________________________________________

I think this speaks louder than words."}
{"text":"This is a terrible place. Server, Jesse, was inattentive,  slow to bring mediocre food, had to be constantly asked to take away used plates. Would never go there again!"}
{"text":"Sometimes things are so wrong that it is nearly unbelievable and that would describe my experience at The Watershed.  Service was the worst I've experienced in a very long time...gorgeous setting but, food was barely mediocre and the restaurant suffered from extremely poor management.  This HUGE restaurant has a total of 3 high chairs so, our day started badly since 2 of the 3 chairs were being used and we had two babies with us.  20 minutes went by, so I went inside and asked them to send us a server...5 minutes later he showed up and took our drink and appetizer order...we should have run then.  It took another 10 minutes before the drinks arrived.  Oh, did I say the appetizer failed to ever appear?  It took nearly an hour before our food arrived...no kidding.  No silverware...no appetizer...virtually no service and to add insult, the food was nothing special at all.  It's not hard to see the problem--horribly weak leadership, failure to be connected to the community (it was Santa day on the island and predictably busier than usual), poor training of host and serving staff, no available kid's menu, no silverware, well, it was basically a whole lot of nothing that cost $51.  I spoke to the manager and expressed our displeasure and to his credit he offered us a gift certificate for future use, but frankly it doesn't deserve a 2nd try.  He should have comp'd the meal or at least discounted it, but nope--oh, that would be another nothing which describes our experience.  Shame on them on so many levels...stay far away."}
{"text":"Went here for an afternoon happy hour. Decent selection of happy hour munchies, but great beer selection as well as a full bar. Nice to play games on the patio by the lake, especially as nicer weather is approaching."}
{"text":"We went here for a sorority brunch. The location is beautiful and the restaurant seems nice. I can't wait to come back and try it on my own. The brunch was more like a continental breakfast so I don't think it was representative of the restaurant.  I'm giving it 5 stars because I love the view. We went for a boat ride afterwards around the lake which was $5 per person and worth it if you like boat rides (I do!). Come check it out. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food and boat ride to boot.  Service is great. Had a great experience on mothers day. Boat ride was a fine way to finish day."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Probably one of the coolest restaurants I've been to in Tempe. Overlooking the lake, it's gorgeous! We came in for Sunday brunch. The menu was great and drink specials were awesome too. We got the DIY mimosas for 15$. It comes with a bottle of champagne and your choice of juice. We got cranberry and pineapple for our mimosas. Super yummy! For food we ordered mahi mahi fish tacos, tri tip sandwich with au ju and delicious crispy French fries, and a berry salad with seared ahi which was to die for! The atmosphere was wonderful, they even had live music at the bar. For the cooler seasons they have a little fire pit on the patio right in the water. We loved the captains lounge which has sofas, a pool table, and life size jenga. There's also a patio where you can play darts. Such a fun place. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I should have read the reviews before we came here.  I love Happy Hour, and I love places that give you time to enjoy happy hour which is why we chose to visit the Watershed on a Friday night.

The location is awesome, right on the water with amazing views of the sunset.  The place is huge and would be a great venue for a special event like a wedding or birthday.
 
We arrived a few min after 6 PM and already the patio is full up, we were quoted a 30 min wait. I hate pointing out empty tables, there were several on the patio, so we chose to sit inside instead.  We're hungry, right?  The waitress says she can't seat us yet (even though the place is empty) and suggests we go to the bar first for a drink.  Ummm, ok?

We get to the bar and are promptly greeted by the bartender (battery operated motorized wine openers, really? Is it that hard your need a machine to do it for you?)  We order off the happy hour menu only to find out they are out of Sangria.  Out?  At 6:10 PM on a Friday?  By now the hostess finally got things figured out and we are seated.

We are seated and try to order drinks again with our server but guess what, they are out of Frozen drinks!  I order a regular drink and the boy orders a beer, both on happy hour and in stock. By now, we've been in the establishment for 20 min with no drinks, not even water.

We decide to start with the Chilli Cheese fries which comes with your choice of Chili or Chile, see what they did there?  Except we weren't given a choice, our server disappeared and we got Chili fries which were 70% beans.

The Boy was dying to try to their Green Chile Meatloaf Double Double and it was amazing!  He was so happy with the side of veggie upgrade told me to quote him in this review \"Peppers, Onions, Zucchini, usually they do some played out, lame, broccoli/cauliflower/carrot mix but this is really good.\"  I am not a green chili fan and I had a bite and it was indeed, really, really, good!  I ordered the calamari which was just meh and was served cold, not fresh out of the fryer.

Here comes where I should have read the other reviews.  It took almost 45 minutes for us to get our meal and this place was no where even close to busy. This is 45 min after we got our appetizer.  I could have sent my cold calamari back but I wasn't sure how long it would take for me to get a refire.  I noticed other tables who had been seated since we got in finally getting their entrees after a long wait.  This is not good.

Things were good, but there were so many timing issues and things being out of stock.  Come here for the view (and the Green Chile Meatloaf) but don't come if you are hungry."}
{"text":"Awesome food and water view! Great service and cold beer. Great boat ride. Quality brunch if you are into that."}
{"text":"I loved this place!!! I don't give many places 5 stars but here it is! 

I came here with my work crew, because one of my co workers was leaving the company. My bosses reserved the Captain's Room. Ok, if you ever have a group of 10 or more, reserve this room! It's great! It's your own private room, with a dining room table, lounge area, two tvs, fireplace, and pool table. The best part about this restaurant is that it is right on the lake so you have a beautiful view while you eat here. The outdoor patio is also very nice. They laid down some grass and have some tables out there as well as corn hole, and darts for you to play. 

Food & drinks.. They have happy hour from 3-6 I believe. We ended up ordering the nachos, coconut shrimp, green chile cheese fries. My favorite was probably the cheese fries. There's a kick to it but it's really good. For drinks, my bosses spoil us. We ordered 4 bottles of wine! I'm a red wine drinker and my favorite is Pinot Noir. It was really good as well as the Cabernet that they had. 

This place is really new so I don't think many people know about it. I think the inside needs some more interior designing and they need a huge sign outside that says The Watershed on it. Also, I would recommend extending the happy hour menu to 7 instead. The service was amazing as well. I need to start taking down servers' names when I go out because I never remember and ours was great! He was extremely friendly and very helpful with our group. I'll definitely be back soon! =)"}
{"text":"The Watershed could be an instant classic. The space and the setting are really stellar. But the food and service are laughably bad. And that's not an expression... every one of my trips there ends in a funny story about the multiple things that are weird and/or go wrong. The waitstaff is all oddly awkward. I've never been unsold an Arnold Palmer until I came here. The same dish, ordered twice during the same visit by different people I am with, will come out noticeably different.  I never imagined a question like \"can you turn your heat lamps on the patio on?\" would leave multiple employees utterly baffled. They used to charge $8 for a plate of French fries (?!?!) Once I asked my server for salt and pepper as he brought my entree. On his third trip back to my table without it, he snapped at me when I asked for it AGAIN. Just fucking bring it. Most recently, it took 3 requests for a kids menu to learn that they have one, but it isn't printed. So he had to read it off his iPhone thingy. It worked out but was just really weird. Same trip,  the process of paying took 30 min, including 15 min between when he dropped it and came back for my payment. Oh, the bartenders... holy crap. Apparently the main requirement to work there is the ability to find as many reasons as you can to stand with your back to customers for as l long as possible. I've seen them mess around with the POS system for 9 or 10 minutes straight without making the most remote attempt to acknowledge people 6 feet away from them staring and waiting for service.

Yes, these stories are plentiful because I have been there a bunch of times. It's an awesome place to hang out. They have live music. I live in the neighborhood. But I could imagine myself going to the watershed ALL THE TIME if their food and service were even solidly  \"passable\". If they somehow read this and opt to be responsive, they could gain a very loyal customer with a sizeable group of friends who live within 2 miles of the place.  General first order needs: consistency, competency, attentiveness. Next:a well thought out menu, where a couple things are done REALLY well and there are no surprises. Specific tip: don't tell me that the very obviously $0.89/lb roma tomatoes on the bruschetta are heirloom. I happen to know the difference."}
{"text":"Me and my wife went on a Saturday at 3pm for a late lunch. We walked in and got seated. Unfortunately the person who was seating us decided to stop and start talking to a friend. Pretty unprofessional. They sat us inside with a nice view to the lake. Our waiter came and we ordered Thai curry bowl and chicken enchiladas. For appetizer we ordered calamari. We also ordered a side salads instead of a side. 

First thing that went wrong was We got our entrees before our salad and appetizer. I mean that defeats the purpose of an entree. Then the kitchen forgot about my salad so another 5min go by and still no salad. Additionally the calamari was too oily and didn't seem fresh. The Thai curry bowl and enchiladas were pretty decent. But me and my wife for the next two days both got food poisoning. 

Honestly besides the view, this restaurant doesn't have much to offer. The bathrooms were really outdated. service wasn't great and food got us sick. Maybe we had a bad experience."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time (on one of those nights where we couldn't decide what either of us wanted)...  we had cocktails at a high-top table by the bar at sunset.  They had a great happy hour where all appetizers were $3 off and there were good drink specials also.  I'm a big beer guy and Alison, our server was super friendly and knowledgable about all the local beers they had on tap.  I was surprised to see quite a few I had never heard of.  After a stressful day, we had a wonderful time overlooking the really cool view of the lake through the panoramic window venue while enjoying great food and great service!  We will recommend for sure!"}
{"text":"Yes ...the first time I stopped in ,I ordered the half rack of ribs and I must admit they were finger lick'n good....My second time I took a date ....Now they use Ipod phones to place your order which is cool....unless the system goes down, now I must say they were on it realized the problem and took care of our order ....Made up for the wait by giving us free dessert ....They also offer \"Live Entertainment\" which is a plus ....So you can enjoy the best of both worlds and you won't  brake the bank....We will go back and tell our friends"}
{"text":"I hope these guys get it going....lots of potencial ...menu leaves you asking for direction..waiter says I'll bring a beer menu...why not just have it with you or on the table rather then waiting?...ordered enchiladas which were very good(a little over priced) had to ask for salsa as did the guy behind me for his fish tacos?..beer is overpriced but maybe \"ok\" at happy hour... Cesare salad had potencial but doused with chili powder and with added shimp the size of a pinky finger...?...anyway.....hope they dont just rest on the location as that alone wont do it...BIG place inside.."}
{"text":"Stopped by for after-movie beverages. 2nd time here. Amazing atmosphere, incredible beer selection, and friendly staff. Bryan was our server; he was knowledgeable and helpful. This place is on the rise. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice place to eat a romantic dinner and hang out by the lake while listening to live music. Cocktails are not bad either"}
{"text":"We came for brunch around 11am and were one of the first tables in the restaurant. We were sat in a nice booth by the window overlooking the lake. Our server was very nice. The mimosa bottle special is a great deal ($15 for a bottle of champagne and choice of juices) and the food was good! Only complaint would be it was really, really hot in the restaurant- had to have been over 80 degrees. Granted there are a lot of windows and a crazy heat wave was happening when we went- but the air conditioning only kicked on maybe two times during the hour or so we were there. We could hear other tables complaining as well.  Definitely a place we would've loved to hang out at for longer, maybe in the cooler months when we can sit on the patio or when the air conditioner works better."}
{"text":"I love the Watershed... the staff is so friendly and easy to work with. The Birthday  party was a success"}
{"text":"Pretty bad.  Went there last Friday.  Service was terrible, had to wait 45 minutes to be seated and then food was mediocre.  Place was so loud. I won't ever go back. Only nice  thing I can say is that it's a lovely lace too bad the management is bad."}
{"text":"Watched the super bowl here today! Food was incredible with free yummy brats at half time! Nice touch!!! Fantastic service....Stephanie rocked and knew all 16 of our names by the second round!!! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We took some out of town relatives to the Watershed last weekend in the afternoon. We hadn't been there in some time.  We sat in the bar area.  Despite the fact that there were 3 staff members standing near the bar no one came to offer us service.  During our stay we had to go to the bar each time to get our own drinks...however the bartender did find time to bring our bill over on 2 occasions.  Our relatives ordered loaded baked potatoes costing nearly  $12.00....what they got were 4 halves of  the smallest driest potatoes I have ever seen! The taste was like cardboard!

The bar area looks like it should be on a dive bar tour.  Loose hanging wires all over the place.  The Watershed needs a knowledgeable manager that cares and/or an owner that is willing to spend a little money and elbow grease to class up the place.  The location is perfect in The Lakes with a fantastic view!  What a shame to look like this on the inside and provide this low level of service.  With only one dish ordered I cannot comment on the other food, although I will say that the menu looks like it came from an actual dive bar.  The bathroom was dirty and uncared for too.  

Please fix this place up so we can be proud to take guests there again."}
{"text":"The view is the only redeeming thing about this place.  We made a reservation on line through Yelp, which worked great.  When we arrived, we were greeted by a surly hostess and we informed her that our reservation was at 6:30 (time was 6:24).  She said \"we will seat you right at 6\".  There was no one in the place and no one waiting!  We stood awkwardly in the lobby for 6 minutes and she took us to our lakeside table.  Great setting!  The waiter took our drink order while we waited for our friends.  Four times in about ten minutes, random waiters showed up with drinks for other people.  Do they have any kind of system?  We ordered pretzels and cheese.  \"Cheese\" is over-microwaved cheese whiz with stale pretzels.  We had to ask for plates, napkins and silverware and waited ten minutes to receive.  The drinks were all tasty.  We ordered fish and chips, a burger and ribs.  The burger was good, ribs so-so and fish and chips arrived stone cold after 45 minute wait.  The waiter took back the fish and chips, where I am certain they re-fried the same pieces and brought them back hot, but overcooked and chewy. Fries were soggy.  Our friends were nearly done eating when we got our food.   Waiter offers free desert vs. any kind of comp on the meal--very lame.  The restaurant was half empty for most of the night, but the bar was very lively.  This appears to be a 30-something neighborhood scene and probably great if all you want is a cocktail.  I sadly cannot recommend for a meal."}
{"text":"First time here and we were looking forward to having lunch here. Should have listened to the reviews. Bad service, server didn't even take a drink order. Just brought water and asked if we were ready to order. Never came by again until he brought the check. Food was extremely mediocre. Very overpriced. And bugs caught in spiderwebs on the ceiling. Someone in our party had bugs fall down into his eating area. We will not be back."}
{"text":"This place has everything it needs, except decent food at a representative price.  If you like being by the water, the location is outstanding.  The building, atmosphere and furniture is all comfortable and inviting.  And on two separate occasions, the service was very good.

Unfortunately, most of us go to restaurants primarily for food, and this is where The Watershed falls short.

We were going to eat dinner, but after tasting the two aps we ordered, we decided to move on.

We ordered the Pretzel Bites and Chips and salsa to start (and ultimately finish).  The Pretzel Bites were not pretzels, and they were not bites.  I am not sure who created this monstrosity, but the \"bites\" were about muffin sized.  And no, not little petite muffins, but full sized your mother makes for Thanksgiving sized muffins.  And, I was even sure how to describe the texture, but again, muffin is about right.  Granted, the outside was a nice dark brown color, and had a touch of soft pretzel like texture, but that is where the resemblance to a pretzel ended.  The interior of the pretzel was about the consistency of a muffin.  Oh, and they were $10.  Yuk......

The chips and salsa appeared to have come out of a bag and a store bought bottle.  Enough said.  

The do have a nice beer list. and the beer was nice and cold.  Would be a decent place for a happy hour, or late night beer.  But, stay away from the food."}
{"text":"Still bad food. Overpriced bad food. They need a better menu and or the chef needs to get inspired"}
{"text":"Could possibly have been the worst service I have ever  experienced. It is obvious that the staff is not trained and not well managed. Once we were given a drink menu, tried to order several different beers only to be told they didn't have them. Drinks were slow to come out. If you want a second drink, order it half way through your first so you get it by the time you finish the first one. Then they brought out two of our five meals. There was no silverware on the table, but there was no one around to ask for any. Had to go inside and request to have some brought out to us. By the time they brought us silverware, the two meals were cold and the three other meals had still not come out. When the other meals finally did come out, they were less than hot. Had to send the steak back. Meanwhile, still waiting on that second round of drinks! One would think that the service would get better once a complaint is lodged, but it only got worse. Waitress disappeared for 15 minutes at a time, no apology from her or a manager, no offer to comp or discount anything. Epic disappointment. The view from the patio is the only reason to go. Do not go, Do NOT go,  DO NOT GO to the Watershed."}
{"text":"FABULOUS! Having graduated from Coronado High School (Scottsdale), our reunion committee really wanted to have our reunion in Scottsdale. However, we wanted a nice place that would allow us to mingle. We were just about to sign with a well known Scottsdale Hotel when a committee member stopped in and talked to the owner, Dan. We ended up sharing half of the restaurant inside & outside with another reunion. So, the whole place was closed due to two private parties. We had about 150 people. We had a dance floor, DJ, the bar, two buffet lines, an area for registration. The food was phenomenal, the bar kept up with us (we spent about $3,000 in liquor), the restaurant made sure water, ice tea and lemonade was available, we decorated to add to the festive atmosphere. When I tell you that this was our 4th reunion (3 held in Scottsdale) and everyone told us it was the absolute best reunion ever . . . I am happy to take the accolades. However, Sharmayne was available for whatever whim we had. We were not the easiest people to please and she never said \"no\" to us. We had a pre-meeting and a tasting with Sharmayne. Sharmayne had a surprise event visitor and her co-event coordinator stepped right in to help us complete the planning. It was gorgeous with the lake as a backdrop, parking was no problem with the second lot, and I would be a happy reference for Dan and Sharmayne.  Thank you for making my event the best!  I am proud to give you my best of recommendations!"}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's party. Ordered the fish taco..taste very salty..worse taco I ever had..lake view is pretty but the food quality REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY needs improvement"}
{"text":"B O M B food!! Fun atmosphere & live music!! The service was great and fast! Get the cheese curds!"}
{"text":"The food was just ok but our server Kayla was awesome as well as the drinks! Nice atmosphere - waterfront in Arizona which frustrates me - IT IS THE DESERT- nice place to be for a few hours"}
{"text":"I was really nervous to come here based on the reviews that I had read - they were either really good or really bad, so I wasn't exactly sure what to expect.  

I must say I am so glad that I decided to go here last night for dinner! Everything was perfect. From the wine all the way to the weather!

Our server was absolutely great. He kept coming back every few minutes to check on us and make sure that we had everyt if we needed. We were in no hurry and were just enjoying the gorgeous sunset and sipping on drinks. Once we ordered our food came out pretty quick - and was really good. I thought it was slightly pricy, but  overall not too bad. Ps if you get fries - the sweet potato ones I liked much better than the regular ones! 

If you can make it in time to watch the sunset over the water it's absolutely awesome. Once it's dark the little lantern type lights they have come on - along with lights strung along the railing and above the patio (and give you blankets to use if you're cold). Inside they have a one man jazz band playing music, so you can't go wrong whether you sit inside or outside! 

We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Waste of a great view and space. Should have known since the place was empty for brunch on a Sunday. Menu was low quality bar food priced at an average of $15 per entree. Food was cold I  got a grilled cheese with the cheese not melted and cold, HOW DO YOU MESS THIS UP. I had to send it back. We had a new waiter who obviously wasn't trained or had any guidance from the very present manager of the facility. The service was horrible even for the poor attempt the new guy made to keep his head above water with the total of 3 tables he had.... slow service for 10 people serving 4 total tables which i am Told is the normal here. Everyone around us was unhappy. Food sucked, drinks sucked, service sucked. Never again."}
{"text":"It was very busy tonight with a wedding but Janice did a great job. The manger always takes care of us if anything goes wrong which only happened a couple times"}
{"text":"Anytime the owner is that rude and unprofessional you earn a one star review. Hey Matt, maybe your restaurant would be doing better if you treated your customers with respect. By the way your pasta drowning in cheesy alfredo sauce shouldn't be on the \"lighter side\" menu. It probably has 3000 calories. NOT RECOMMENDED"}
{"text":"3 and a half stars.  Nice place to eat by the water. Visiting from California. The brunch buffet was good and mimosas were too. We will go back if ever in Tempe again."}
