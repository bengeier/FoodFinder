{"text":"Came here skeptical because of the bad review, but I enjoyed the experience! 

Tuesday night, not very busy, and didn't experience the slow service that is so rampant in previous reviewers experiences. Had the grilled cheese with the tomato soup. Both were delicious. My only peeve was that we were charged $3 for each of our waters. What's up with that 

But overall, good experience."}
{"text":"I'm surprised to see that Belgo does not have higher ratings! I had gone to Belgo when my family came to visit and everyone loved it. The restaurant has a nice laid-back atmosphere with a business-casual feel. Being right in the heart of the city, many people working in downtown stop in for a meal or drink giving the restaurant a fancy appeal. Belgo, however, is rather expensive for food and drink, but the food is worth the price!

The service at Belgo was a little slow, but nothing too bad to complain about."}
{"text":"A seriously lacklustre experience, not to be repeated.  It took nearly 10 minutes for a server to come to our table to even take a drink order. 

The food itself was ok, but certainly not worth the 5 star pricing on the menu. One of our guests had to send his Cobb salad back twice, and that is NOT a complicated dish!

Barely an apology for the mistake from Belgo, and no discount on the bill for the problems we had. 

Won't be back."}
{"text":"Another tough one to fit into a '5 Star' system.  It's probably somewhere in between a two and a three but, oddly, I can also see a case for it being a four star (how weird is that??).  Belgo tries hard to be an upscale Belgian Beer Bistro... probably one of the first 'gastro pubs/lounges' to give it a go in Calgary but, unfortunately, I think they miss it on a few levels.

It's also a bit weird to sum up a review with 'Headings' but in the case of Belgo they kind of jump out at you when you're there (so to speak).  So here are my discussion points that completely sum up Belgo: Nasty Cleavage; Wide Beer Selection; Poncey Food; and WAAAaaaay Overpriced.

Nasty Cleavage - Ok... I get it.  Direct from the Paul Vickers school of restaruant management, there's no question the formula works.  That said, there's a good side and a bad side to everything.  When I get nervous that some poor dear's breast may explode or spontaneously plop into my pint we're clearly on the 'bad' side... when the 'uniform' is 'plunging little black dress' but many have to wear the Addition Elle version - 'bad' side (discussion topic: when a 'mini skirt' gets over a certain size, isn't it more properly a 'maxi skirt'?... but i digress).  

Wide Beer Selection - Probably the most interesting selection of beer on tap in downtown Calgary (which on its own would lead many to give Belgo 4 Stars... I mean, if you just HAVE to have a pint of Erdinger Weissbeir and you don't want to fly to Munich, you can get one at Belgo on tap.

Poncey Food - And this is a weird one for me.  I generally like 'upscaled' pub food but for whatever reason the fare I've had and seen at Belgo has fallen into the catagory of needlessly poncey; contrived; insincere.  Notwithstanding this, I had a very nice simple sandwich at lunch a few days ago that was really quite excellent (and the only 'poncey' part on this occassion was it being listed on the menu as a 'Club Maison').

WAAAAaaaay Overpriced - Another vestige of Calgary's boom.  It's softened a bit at Belgo but pricing is still a real problem.  A pint of beer ought not to be $10 and lunch specials shouldn't be running $25.  

All together, I suppose I understand why some call Belgo home.  I'll admit that I'll still go there from time to time.  I suppose when it comes right down to it my 2 Stars is really based on 'what might have been'.  Belgo could really be something special; I'm just saddly disappointed with what it is."}
{"text":"I really like the food here. The times I've had lunch here I've never been disappointed. I've had the seared sea scallops (served with beluga lentils, cauliflower puree and pancetta) as an appetizer and as a main course (not for the same meal but I totally would - they are that good!), the baby beet salad (an interesting and refreshing mix of oranges, watermelon and beets) and the corn, tomato and mushroom mac & cheese. 

The quality of the food is upscale, but I don't find the atmosphere or prices pretentious at all."}
{"text":"Came here for a business meeting on a Friday for breakfast. We were seated relatively quickly, but that's where the good news ends.

It took the servers 20 minutes to even acknowledge we were there, even though we were one of only about 5 tables being used. One group who were seated beside us actually got up and left because the service was taking so long. Finally someone took our drink order. When our coffees came they were cold and almost inedible, ridiculous for a place that charges so much for a simple latte.

The service continued to be sub par as the waitress forgot to bring two of the side dishes ordered and didn't bring a drink for the duration of the meal, but it still ended up on the bill. 

The food was just okay, nothing too special and definitely not worth the prices they are charging. I definitely wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check this place out forever but never really got around to it. Today though we made a last minute decision to come here. We didn't have a reservation but they were able to find us a table (it was around 12:30 on a Thursday). The host was really keen on making it work for us. Our server was helpful and friendly and very down to earth. Her attention to detail improved over time too which was nice. My friend has dietary restrictions and the server really made an extra effort to make sure that she was getting something that wouldn't make her sick. Our order also came at a good speed.

The food itself was 3 stars. Presentation was awesome. I had the burger and while the patty was quite flavourful, there was too much bun and the bun was too bland. The fries/wedges were salty and also kind of \"meh\". There was a truffle aoili that was quite tasty with it as well, but didn't really make me want to eat the fries.

They don't take debit (the server was very apologetic about that) but they do have a cash machine. I really think not taking debit these days is essentially like not taking cash. Most people don't carry cash anymore (they are just packing the debit card) and I resent having to use a no name ATM and pay crazy service fees or put it on credit. It is silly. And come on, at the prices they charge, the can afford whatever it costs to offer debit as well as credit cards.

Service was great, food was somewhere in the middle and the debit thing was just n unfortunate way to end the meal. So three stars. Still not a bad choice for the area though if you are packing cash or credit."}
{"text":"The experience started with our try to make a reservation for Belgo. We called them just to hear that they had no time currently to take our reservation and asked us to call again later... We did so, but nobody answered the phone anymore. I would have stopped right here but we had a gift voucher for Belgo, so we made an online reservation.

When we arrived on a Friday evening the place was packed. Our table was in the forward part close to the bar area so we had a quite good overview what was going on but it was also very loud.

The waitress seemed disinterested and just dropped the menu without pointing out any features or explaining anything. The service over the evening was 'relaxed' to 'slow' and we were in for about 2 hours for a two-course meal.

After all the food was ok but it was definitely not what you expect for the money you pay. We payed round about $80 for a meal for two persons including one drink each (1 beer and 1 glass of the wine-special).

Way to expensive and service is below freezing - there are better places for less money just around the corner.

I was close to giving one star only and we will probably not return. However, the food was ok and when you accept the 'atmosphere' and the high prices you might still like it."}
{"text":"First of all, this place doesn't take debit. I am still amazed that we have high end restaurants that don't have debit. That fucking sucks in my opinion and I would never ever return here simply because of that. And that is also why I give it only 2 stars. 

There were several other things that contribute to my low rating. Belgo is so bloody loud, I could hardly hear the people sitting across from me at our table. We had come here for a going away lunch for a co-worker. I was unable to chat with anyone other than the guy right beside me. The table we were sitting at was right by a heater and I was baking. I felt like I was in a basement. Not a great atmosphere. Again, I would not come back here.

Service was ok but I don't recall our waitress coming back to check on how our lunch was. I had the $15 beef dip which was very tasty. First time I've tried a pretzel bun and it was really good. The ceaser salad was tasteless. Where were the bacon bits? Disappointment here. One of my coworkers had a hamburger with a gluten free bun that looked all crumbly. She said it was dry and tasted like it was a week old. The manager came by to discuss the crappy bun and comped her meal. She didn't want to wait for them to make another hamburger. I don't blame her. It really looked brutal. Another coworker ordered the beet salad and when it didn't have the goat cheese it said on the menu, our waitress said a lot of people don't want it. But she did bring it out after. However, it was already after my coworker had almost finished her salad and if you can believe this, all the cheese she got was a tiny blob in a shot glass. You gotta be kidding me. What a joke. I don't think my expectations were that high. Bottom line, if the menu says the salad comes with goat cheese, then include it.

Belgo is over rated and over priced. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Food: 2.5/5
Service: 2/5
Overall experience: 2/5

(1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)

Came here twice in one week and I've concluded Belgo Brasserie is NOT the place to go for a nice meal or drinks. The one thing that stands out in my mind is how terrible the service is. On both visits, I happened to have the same waitress and it took her a good 10-15mins before she even acknowledged us... it wasn't even busy! She immediately asks us if we wanted any drinks, and on both occasions never offered us water. 

Belgo Brasserie is a fairly large restaurant with tons of seating. There is the front of the restaurant where the bar is, a second level, and then more tables towards the back where you can host private parties. It has nice high ceilings so it doesn't feel too stuffy, and has a simple yet modern French Bistro look. There were inconsistencies with the table setting though... the smaller dining tables had tablecloths while the taller 'bar tables' didn't. I happened to sit at one without a cloth and found that the table was dirty with cup ring stains and god knows what else.

On my first visit I had drinks and dessert. Majority of their drink list consists of wines and beers ($7+), traditional cocktails ($9), and martinis ($10). I tried their West Coast Caesar (Smoked Salmon Vodka and Wasabi Salted Rim). It had a strong Smoked Salmon taste which was interesting, and the rim tasted more like seaweed than wasabi. For a girly/sweet drink I suggest a \"Blue Orchid\" Martini (Gin, Soho Lychee, Blue Curacao, and Grenadine). Very strong, but delicious to sip on. 

The highlight was their \"Creme Brulee Napoleon\" dessert ($10). Big enough to share and packed with flavour and textures. The dessert is like a wagon wheel with dark chocolate and an almond cookie crust. Instead of the marshmallow fluff you have a yummy custard in the middle. The flavours and textures worked very well together and it wasn't overly sweet. My only complaint is that the sugar on top was burnt and the custard could have been smoother. I highly recommend this dessert!

The other desserts on their menu are generic: Molten chocolate cake; banana split with mango and coconut gelato; strawberries romanoff; maple toffee cheese cake, and lemon tart. I also tried their Strawberries Romanoff dessert which was terrible. Made of Florentine cookie, citrus mousse, and grand marnier infused strawberries, I was expecting the traditional dessert. Instead, I received plain old strawberries, and a hard buttery almond cookie shaped to encase a store bought tasting sponge cake with a grainy mousse on top. 

Their dinner menu has a little bit of everything: steaks, seafood, pasta, poutine, sandwiches, ribs, salads, etc... Belgo Brasserie's cuisine is \"French Fusion\", but I saw very little French influence. 

I ordered their Oysters on Half Shell ($3/each) paired with a delicious mignonette sauce. The oysters tasted very clean. I also shared an order of Mac and Cheese ($16) with lobster, bacon, mushrooms and cognac cream. A nice big portion with a lot of fresh, sweet lobster pieces. If you love mac and cheese, this is the perfect dish since it was very creamy and full of cheese. My only criticism would be that the cream/cheese mixture wasn't even distributed throughout the pasta. 

Overall, try to avoid Belgo Brasserie. It's like a more expensive version of Moxies. There is no real 'flair' to the menu and the service is terrible."}
{"text":"I have to agree with many others on here, the service is not good at all... I  booked my table a week ago to have a business lunch with a colleague. When I arrived I was disappointed to see that I was sat at quite literally the last table in the restaurant  we were in what felt like a long corridor, and while the front of the restaurant was bustling, we were in the back where it was empty and dead. 

The food - so disappointing. As a vegetarian I didnt see a lot of options, so I had the grilled cheese without bacon with the tomato soup. 
While the soup was tasty enough, the grilled cheese was incredibly average - Ive actually had a better grilled cheese at the Blackfoot diner! 
In general all the food that I saw going past  us  was decidedly small - small portions and expensive. 

The service was slow - we waited approx 10 minutes to have our order taken, and when you are clearly there during your lunch hour - unacceptable. 
Its a shame as Belgo looked promising.  
Food - average and poor value
Service - Slow
Prices - moderate 
I will not be back."}
{"text":"We randomly ended up at Belgo because our dinner plans at Craft didn't pan out. Located in Stephen Ave, Belgo for a Saturday night was...a not very busy. Which I hate to say, is a \"mediocre experience\" waiting to happen.

That's a bit harsh for me to say, and when I did talk to our waitress (who represented the place's friendly service) she mentioned Belgo was often busy on lunch weekdays and their main draw was the \"corporate crowd\"

First thing I found odd was for a large restaurant, they only had single person washrooms. Both times I went there was always a line-up.

Their meal experience was ok. Some of my friends were kinda disappointed at the blandness of their meal and constantly griped about how their food \"needed salt\". I got the 401 burger with yam fries. The burger was OK but the yam fries could've used some spicing up. I was hungry and was satisfied but the meal experience wasn't too great for me to want to go back.

Overall, Belgo is as pricey as a trip to Moxey's or Earls. And I would rather drop the same amount of money and get more at the local pub than go to a more upscale joint like Belgo."}
{"text":"I've had a number of business lunches here - the food is always really good, and the service is pretty good if you do not have a large group."}
{"text":"I went here for NYE 2011 for the first time and it will be the last time. 

I was part of a group of 7.  There were 2 vegans and 1 vegetarian so we were concerned about the prix fixe menu.  We talked to a lady in marketing and someone in the kitchen and told her we wouldn't come unless everyone had something to eat at each of the 4 courses and we were told a suitable menu was being created so we confidently booked all 7 of us.   

We arrived and I let our server know about the special dietary needs and he went to check the notes.  He came back and said nothing was noted on the reservation and we told him what the marketing lady had said and he just looked at us and said \"yeah but she's in marketing\" as if that didn't matter.   I made a stink,  he offered a large salad and dessert and I demanded to speak with someone.  Eventually he came back and said something would be created.    Later they attempted to feed the 3 vegetarians foie gras (duck liver) without the veal au jus (as if that makes it vegetarian....) and he attempted to serve the vegans both cheese and ice cream (despite being explicitly told what vegan meant).

The prix fixe ultimately looked like this:

Vegan
appetizer:  nothing
Salad:  good and created special
main: spaghetti
dessert:  nothing

vegetarian
appetizer: nothing
salad: as per menu
main:  a lentil dish (a larger portion of the side on the lamb dish)
desert: as per menu

definitely not as promised on the phone in three conversations before hand.  no one that got appetizers liked them,  salads were good,  mixed reviews on the entrees, and the desserts were unsatisfying.  

Aside from that:

Service was slow.  Everyone at the table was starving between courses.  We waited a long time from sitting for the first course.  Some courses were a 30 minute wait.   Some drinks were forgotten about by server.  Food arrived cold when it arrived (but no one dared send it back in fear of starving to death).  

Entertainment was weak.  It was obvious no sound check was done.  We couldn't hear the entertainment for a few hours.  The venue wasn't a very good one for the type of entertainment there was so they roamed around.... because the sound didn't work and there wasn't really visible entertainment I barely noticed it existed.   In the end everyone crowded into one area not set up for more than a couple handfuls of people to see and dance. 

The bill was messed up.  We were a party of 7 and it was a minimum 20% gratuity for a party of 8.  We had the 20% gratuity enforced anyway and we were furious and no one would talk to us about it.   This was 20% on top of the fact the vegans paid full price for half the food despite being told otherwise in advance.   All the wine was billed at the price of the most expensive wine one person drank  when 3 kinda were ordered at the table (which no one was responsive enough to correct on the bill).  The difference wasn't major but it's an extra grievance.  Anyway we were not happy with the billing or the service or the mix up.  

We weren't the only unhappy table.    I saw a friend there who only had their server pop by once to take drinks and their food was slower than ours (not brought by the server) so it was almost like they didn't have a server and the kitchen staff walked around with the extra food trying to find people who weren't yet eating.   Because they had over 8 people they also were charged 20% and the bar would not take their drink orders until a certain time period because there was table service (tongue in cheek) ...  they spent the remaining night arguing with management about the 20% forced tip when they didn't get service.   All they wanted to do was get their drink on but it was as dry as an AA meeting at their table. 

Some of my party left before midnight they were so disappointed and left to try and salvage the night... and frankly I wish I had never gone or left with them."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit to Belgo very much. I went for a birthday party, so we had the back of the top level to ourselves. The layout is a little inconvenient (a U shape with a big hole in the middle that looks down onto the lower level of the restaurant) but it ended up being a pretty good location for eating, mingling & (later) dancing.

The server was very nice, although a little inconsistent - she refilled my drinks & water constantly but completely ignored my tablemates unless I drew her attention to them. We laughed and worked around it.

I only had a French Onion Soup, so I can't say too much about the food, but that which I did have was excellent. Others at the table had lobster tail (fairly good), a clubhouse sandwich (sandwich excellent, fries left much to be desired) and a banana split (very good). Good value for the price.

I was shocked at how quiet it was on a Saturday night - not sure if that has to do with Calgary's downtown scene or the venue itself. Either way, I'll make another visit to try out more of the menu."}
{"text":"We went there on a Thursday night in a group of 7. The restaurant was almost empty. However, it took them at least 30 minutes to take our order. The beer selection is good but definitely over priced. We ordered the calamari and club wrap. 

For a 15$ calamari, you will receive a very small portion which taste bland and rubbery (probably frozen calamari). They pour a sticky sweet sauce on top of the dish which took away all of the crispiness, highly not recommended. 

The club wrap was a pretty boring sandwich. Nothing special. I asked for hot sauce to  make it a little bit interesting. Hot sauce arrived in a huge (0.5 liter) greasy bottle , I believe from the kitchen!!!!!! The house salad as the side, was good but again nothing special. 

And the grand finale was another 30 minutes to have the bill. For an almost empty restaurant, the staff were very distracted. 

We ended up paying $49 for two beers and two very small dishes/appetizers. There are way better restaurants in town that have both good beer and good food. I am not going back there again."}
{"text":"Poutine was amazing. We had it w their mushrooms and it was the best blend of a flavorful sauce that wasn't too salty, fries that were well cooked and slightly crunchy and a huge assortment of great beers to wash it down to gear you up for the next bite. Their seafood selection was well prepared and definitely take a look at their chef's choices as they're a great deal."}
{"text":"What a terrible experience.

Went there in a group of 8 people.
Our order took 1.5 hours to arrive (just a few burgers, salads, and a steak. nothing fancy).
We complained to our server (who was very nice and genuinely embarrassed by the service).

When the food arrived, they forgot one of the orders! So everyone else's food was somehow spoiled since one person was sitting at the table with no food. 
Again we complained... they finally brought the missing dish, and charged us double in the end!
The steak was so bad that we sent it back uneaten. (They took it off the bill).

- The Seafood tower appetizer is not worth the 80+ $ you have to pay for it. and I think the beer is over priced.

Definitely not going back.
The Food and the quality is not worth the price you have to pay.
There are lots of other better cheaper options in the same block. 

Don't waste your time and money."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once for a special cooking class (I'm not sure if they officially do them or if it was a favor they did for my boss) and once for a birthday.

1. It's TOTALLY dead on a Saturday night. Totally.
2. The beer is really expensive. Like $10 a pint for some (that are regular $8 at most other bars)
3. They think they're fancier than they are. 

I haven't actually had much food there. The calamari was good though.

All in all, I won't go again unless I'm forced (birthday, work party etc). The price tag just isn't worth what you're getting in return."}
{"text":"Atmosphere: 5/5
Parking: 2/5
Service: 3/5
Food Quality: 2/5
Value: 3/5

Aimed at the downtown crowd, this place is meant for those who want to be seen.  From that perspective, its quite good!  Upper and lower level dining area means that this place is ideal for the after work crowd and gives posers maximum exposure.  The dining area is also beautiful.  Great appointments make each table a nice little environment for your dining party.

The bad news is that the food doesn't step up to match the interior design and neither does the service.  This place is all about pretence with a capital P.  Once you get beyond the surface veneer, one finds that the food is bland and the service is mediocre.  In asking about drink specials, the waiter actually pointed at the liquor menu and said \"read it for yourself\".  The food was nicely presented but was utterly without flavour and in the end, I left wishing we had just gone to Subway.  Disappointed!"}
{"text":"Wifey and I went to belgo a few nights a go (the night before new year eve)

The restaurant was dead. REALLY DEAD. But all of down town seemed particularly slow. 

So service was great. Food arrived right on time and for the most part food portions were well sized and the food tasted pretty good. Wifey didn't enjoy the cut of chicken she was given as it was kind of hard to \"pick a part\" in her words.....(she can be fussy for an adult) 

All together our experience was great!"}
{"text":"Beer Beer Beeeeeeeeeeeeer, table for 1???
Amazing beer selection and well priced.  The service has been good so far and the food is tasty.   On Friday nights it seems to tame down around 10 but after work it's on wheeeels!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Belgo for a while and was just there today on a business lunch.  They had a folded up menu that was wrapped around my napkin.  It was a different approach to receiving a menu, that's for sure.  Then, the waitress came round and gave us the specials and they have this 2 for $25 deal.  You get to pick one of 3 appetizers and one of 3 entrees.  

The 3 appys for today's deal were:
Tomato soup
Waldorf Salad
Coconut Shrimps

The 3 entrees for today's deal were:
Alfredo Chicken
Salmon
Flank Steak

I selected the Coconut Shrimp and the Flank Steak.  I really liked the Coconut Shrimp sitting in a small mound of mesclun mix.  Very tender shrimp shrouded with a coconut-flaked batter.  The dip was soooooo good!  Mustardly aioli of some kind.  Delicious!  

I had the Flank Steak and had it rare.  It came with fingerling potatoes, brocolli, red pepper.  Not too bad.  

Dessert:  The waitress recommended us the Creme Brulee with a twist.  The custard part is dipped in chocolate, then the top part was caramelized.  This chocolate-dipped custard sat on 3 strawberries on top of the round thin almond cake base.  There was a mango dipping sauce decorated around it.  Interesting dessert.  

Service was good.  The waitress kept checking to see if we needed anything and made sure we were happy with the food we had ordered."}
{"text":"I like Poutine. (Especially with sausage) -  Anyone who doesn't?

My esteemed sister and I went to Belgo this week for a mid-week lunch and some deliciousness. I haven't been to Belgo for five years - so I knew I liked it then and was excited for this round two adventure. It didn't disappoint. I remembered a great poutine, so I surely ordered it again for an appetizer (because carbs are my friend) and it was really good. It was very hot (read here very fresh), awesome cheese curds, good sauce, delicious sausage slices and nice big toasty taters for \"fries\". Score one for the poutine.

A cute feature they offer is the 2 for 25$ deal which gives you a choice of three appetizers and choice of three mains for 25 $ - which is a decent price at a high end restaurant. However, we were swayed away to the lunch menu as there were numerous items that peaked our interest. My sister in crime ordered the burger which she shared graciously with me - and it was delicious. They did a good burger. I had the prime rib beef dip which was yummy! It came with a surprisingly large amount of really great meat and beef dip that was really tasty (not too salty either). Only complaint is the sandwich could have been a little hotter. The star of the meal was the mac and cheese as a side (yes - a restaurant that gives an awesome M&C side option like the USA - loves it). It was in a small dish to its own, nicely hot, roasted tomatoes and chicken included. It made me very happy to have as an option and happier it was well done. 

The beer menu as mentioned below is outstanding and they likely have one of the biggest in the city with lots of import beer. It makes for a fun Saturday night of taste testing with a poutine. The prices can be a bit high for the steaks and main dishes, but it's expected for the restaurant that it is (the lunch prices were very reasonable and comparable).

Our service on this visit was exceptional and the waitress was a joy to have as our server (wish I knew her name). Her perfect amount of joking with the right amount of professionalism made her fun to have at our table doing follow-ups and water refills. I easily booked the reso on Open Table which was convenient as it was quite full by noon with the downtown sales crowd."}
