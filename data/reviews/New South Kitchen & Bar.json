{"text":"My first visit was for restaurant week. If they can treat people this well during a $30 meal week then they have to be amazing all other times of the year as well.  We loved the atmosphere as well. Our server was so sweet and attentive.  The food was absolutely delicious and so great. My suggestion is the Pork Tenderloin dish! My goodness. I will be going back.....often!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for the first time with my boyfriend and it was awful. The service was very unattentive and slow. We ordered an omelet and egg rolls and it took thirty minutes for our food and we were the only two in the restaurant. And let's not talk about the mixed drinks. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Sirloin was cooked medium with pan fried potatoes and horse radish spinach with gravy and it was very excellent.  Service was on point, biscuits with butter free with the meal, and place had a romantic atmosphere."}
{"text":"New South Kitchen is the former Dakota's, located in the Arboretum Shopping Center.  Four of us went for lunch yesterday - and I won't go back again.  Pretty limited lunch menu plus a buffet option (spaghetti and meat balls).  Menu was \"small plates\", \"salad plates\" and \"sandwiches\".  Didn't try any of the \"small plates\" but the fried okra salad was a pretty small plate too!  Two of us ordered the burger which was small and came with a choice of one side dish - fruit or potato salad.  This looked like the best choice at the table.  Fourth person ordered the grilled club - ham, turkey, cheese on a flatbread - with the same choice of sides.  No discernable trace of the turkey on the club sandwich and it was very spicy, much more like a quesadilla than a club sandwich!  And the potato salad was bland.  All menu items were priced in the $8 - $10 range.  Desserts were more creative than I've seen on the menu elsewhere - cheese plate, beignets, roasted bananas.  But for the price (comparable to Harper's, a little less expensive than Maggiano's), I was very disappointed.  In my humble opinion, smaller plates (which I really think are a great idea - most places give you way too much food) should also carry smaller price tags.  Am I being unreasonable here?  Lunch crowd was VERY sparse.  If this is indicative of their overall business, better try this place - if you dare - while you can!  To the table of three ladies seated in the booth beside us - if you're going to discuss the virtues of latex vs. lambskin for disease prevention at the lunch table, you might be better served having lunch at home rather than out in public!    Service was nice (not great), food was barely ok, prices way too high for what you got - plus you have to battle the Arboretum parking lot!  Only two stars."}
{"text":"This place was so good! I had the fried chicken Lunch. With beignet. It was amazing! I really recommend at least trying it, bur be careful, you might be addicted!"}
{"text":"My family went to dinner at New South last night for my parents' anniversary. The atmosphere was nice - the dimmed lighting set a relaxed tone. The food was generally pretty good. I had a small plate, the daily flatbread, which was good, but more filling than I expected. I also had the macaroni and cheese as a side dish, which was very tasty. The biscuits were excellent. Also, we enjoyed the half price wine by the glass last night (Sunday). I gave this restaurant four stars, because our waitress was slow in refilling our drinks and some of the grilled vegetables served with entrees could have used another minute or two cooking."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is so good!!!  My husband and I went here on a Sunday night after a day of hiking. We cook at home often and do a really good job of it so I'm pretty hard on restaurants.   Im happy to report this one exceeded expectations!!  We had the pork belly, which was fried to perfection, the daily flatbread, a delicious and quality item, the deviled eggs, which came with three different varieties!, and the grilled romaine, possibly the best salad I've ever had!  They also have a good selection of craft beer and wine. Amazing. I'll absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"This place used to be consistent but my last couple of visits have been average.  Went for lunch with a few adults and a couple of kids.  Salad was small for $13+.  Wife said fried okra wasn't as good as she remembered.  Biscuits were OK but not great.  I hope they get their mojo back because this used to be a solid spot."}
{"text":"Wow. Great service and knew the menu really well. Dinner of pork chops with sweet potatoes and cabbage were off the hook."}
{"text":"New South is my go-to choice when I want to be taken care of. Sure it's in a strip mall (the Arboretum) and therefore faces the parking lot, but if you don't like the view, just face the other way!  New South features upscale southern food. Pricing is good and I'm really digging their draft beer selections and drink specials. I went there Saturday night and had some really delicious locally-brewed beer for $3 a pint!  I also had one of the entree specials: The \"local\" flounder (local? how local? whatever!) on top of herbed spaetzle mixed with delicious little pieces of sweet potato and spinach. I got my beta carotene and I didn't even feel like I was eating vegetables! My husband had the American Kobe beef, (they said it was Kobe-style but raised here) which was also yummy.  Cooked just right.  The service is always friendly and I love the fact that I can get a nice cozy table without a reservation (usually). We really love to go there in the winter, because it's kind of dark in there (more difficult to see the parking lot) and a good glass of cabernet and a warm meal just feels comforting."}
{"text":"I came in town for Charlotte Restaurant Week and was completely disappointed with my experience at this restaurant. After drooling over the pictures on the website, I was so excited to try this place. My friend and I were sat immediately, but were taken to a tiny tot table floating awkwardly in the middle of the dining room. We had to ask the hostess to move us to one of the other six empty tables where we wouldn't feel like we were on display.   Our server, let's call him Grumps because he never actually introduced himself to us, automatically assumed that we wanted the preset menu without asking. He missed an opportunity to introduce us to the regular menu, did not inquire if we wanted cocktails, or anything outside of the complimentary red or white. He acted as if it was a chore to serve us, and kept this attitude up all evening.  Now on to the food. To start my friend had the fried green tomatoes, bland is a great description for this, in fact bland could be used to describe everything we ate except for the pork belly and one dessert. For entrees we had the pan fried chicken and the shrimp and grits. The chicken was the better entree, as the shrimp had no seasoning at all. For dessert, we had the pound cake and beignets. The pound cake was probably the best thing we had all night, the beignets were more like hot fried balls of dough-more akin to a hush puppy or blob of funnel cake than a beignet.   Grumps continued to make us feel uncomfortable and unwelcome. I hate that I wasted an opportunity to eat at a great restaurant by eating at New South Kitchen."}
{"text":"Fresh food, locally sourced. Friendly staff and always new menu items to go along with the favorites. Homemade Pimento Cheese with flatbread!"}
{"text":"Took one hour 50 minutes to get food and eat dinner.  Food was ok.  Steak was not cooked properly - had to be sent back.  Waiter was busy waiting other tables, despite staff being everywhere - no one stopped by our table to offer us water refills.  All in all - meh.  Service fell off the cliff after we were seated.  They need a manager to make sure service is on point - definitely was not on point tonight. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Best meatloaf I have ever had hands down!  I went with about 8 family members and everyone enjoyed the food.  Definitely a new go to for me!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed a dinner here when visiting Charlotte. Nice vibe. Good food. Knowledgeable wait staff very much willing and able to accommodate allergies, etc.  Fresh and local ingredients. Don't miss dessert!  The blueberry pie with ice cream was a real treat."}
{"text":"This small restaurant in a strip mall was better than I expected. The warm biscuits and butter was a great start along with the New South Tea. I had the Chicken and Waffles and the hubby had the Fried Catfish. Everything was cooked perfectly. We also had a side of Mac n Cheese which is definitely a must. Overall this is a nice neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"I went during Queen's Feast which is like a Restaurant Week.  The menu consists of a wine, 2 apps, entree, and dessert - all for $30.  I thought the deal was too good to pass up, since ordering just an entree + salad would've came to about the same price.  The entree choices didn't have what I came for (flank steak), so I picked the meatloaf.  The dish came with potatoes, which is the most tasty I've had.  Instead of mashing everything, the cubes still kept a bit of their shape and had lots of flavor (probably thanks to bacon fat).    As for the meatloaf, I was not a fan.  The consistency was like over-processed mystery meat.    As for the 2 apps, the fried green tomatoes (my first time eating this) sounded better than it really is.... it's like eating a fried cornmeal crust with bland tomatoes inside.  The grilled salad was very good though.... the lettuce leaves have a nice charred / smoke flavor.   My dessert which is the bread pudding with ice cream was a bit too sweat.  The ice cream was tasty but too sweet and I felt ice crystals in it (maybe that's natural for homemade ice cream?).  It would've helped to get a spoon with it which wasn't provided.  The portion size was pretty small.  Not that I could've eaten more after the other courses, but if this is the same size as a normal order, then I'd probably be disappointed.  Overall the price was reasonable, and the waitress was very friendly."}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere was AWESOME!!! I will be back. A must try!! The waitress was very friendly and helpful with making selections for dishes. There was no wait. The host was friendly coming in and leaving the Resturant."}
{"text":"Overall view of this place: \"It was just meh! ... you could do better\" -- Read more to know why:  I've been to this place three times now. I know ... what is wrong with me? I've given this place \"two stars\" and have been there three times. You'd think I would have learned my lesson the first two times.  Each time I go there, I find myself saying in my head, \"Well maybe if I got this, my meal would be better ... or maybe my pallet is off today.\" The thing is ... it's not my taste buds or the dish I got, it's the chef. The food is just ok. Sorry but it's true.  On the bright side the decor is really cute. It's well lit and very \"shabby chic\" with cast iron skillets hanging inside rustic wood picture frames. You really want to like the place.   I bought one of those \"entertainment books\" ... you know, the books that the neighborhood kid sells for their church or band club at school. The book had a coupon for this place so we were like, \"what the heck ... let's try New South out.\"  The first time I went for lunch, well more like brunch, since it's was around 11:45ish and it was the weekend. I got the \"florentine omelet\". It consists of: 3 egg omelet with spinach, mushrooms, onions & goat cheese topped with creole sauce -- served with pan fried potatoes or grits (I got the potatoes)  The thing with this dish was, the goat cheese over powered the entire meal. It was like I was eating a plate of goat cheese with a side of everything else. Not good ... not good at all.  The next time I went with my gal pal who had \"yet another coupon\" from the entertainment book. This time I decided to order a fail safe plan ... the \"New South Burger\". This consisted of: a beef burger topped with house made pimento & cheese, smoked bacon, lettuce & tomato.   Again with the heavy hand on cheese. Yuck ... and I LOVE cheese.  Also, the burger was a bit dry and I didn't ask for it overly well done on anything. So that really should have not happened. It's like the cook squeezed out all the juices. It was \"just ok\" again.  AND then the last and final time I went there, it was for dinner with my dad and husband. We were super starving and figured the Arboretum shopping center is close so why not give this place another try. \"You know cause third times a charm and all that jazz.\" Well don't believe that saying for a minute because it a down right lie.    I mean the menu seems so creative. It should work, right? Wrong. The execution is just NOT done correctly. My dad got the Monday special of the night \"fried chicken with buttermilk biscuits and gravy\". His review of the meal was that, \"it was alright\" ... with a shake of the hand.   Both my husband and I got the \"cornmeal dusted flounder\" served with caramelized autumn veggies, local greens and lemon butter. It was \"bleck\" Spell that word out and you'll understand what it means. B-L-E-C-K ... Yuck.   The server suggested it. I was torn between the 1/2 roasted chicken and that. The waiter said go with the flounder so I did. Boy was he wrong. The fish was mushy and the veggies were vinegary to the point of no return. It was not good at all.   Also, geeze louise. We had the hands down \"worst service\" that night. It was like our server quit or something. BUT HE DIDN'T ... he was just MIA and the manager or owner or whomever he was ended up waiting on the majority of the time. It's was a big confusing mess.   I'd really like to rave about this place. I LOVE FOOD and really enjoy giving good reviews ... but if it's not good I'm not going to pretend it was. I eat for pleasure ... my mom's a chef and I know food. This place is just not up to snuff. Womp, womp!"}
{"text":"Glad to find a local farm to table restaurant in South Charlotte. Try the fried green tomatoes. Great friendly service."}
{"text":"Food was excellent especially the green tomato and pickled shrimp soup.  We also tried the fish medley soup and it was excellent.  I had The fried turkey with cranberries and stuffing dressing and collard greens.   My husband had the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and fresh green  beans.  Both were very good however I'm partial to turkey. The homemade biscuits were very good but unfortunately you get no refills. Otherwise I would've up my rating by an extra star. Would also be a great choice for vegetarians."}
{"text":"An amazing twist on country food. And the fact that the food is prepared by with local meats and veggies makes it even more special. I experienced the lunch menu, but cannot wait to go back for the diner extravaganza!!"}
{"text":"My whole family loves this restaurant.  It's our favorite neighborhood spot because the food is consistently fantastic, plus they source from local farms.  We love the southern, farm to table approach. I have two favorite dishes, the Okra Salad and the Pan Fried Chicken. Both usually come with warm buttermilk biscuits and apple butter. Yum. New South is the best restaurant for a nice brunch, lunch and/or dinner in the Arborteum area of Charlotte. We go way too much but we love it."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch right after it opened. Considering the reviews and the price, I was expecting more than a booth with a paper menu. Anyways, the waitress had an opinion (always weird to hear them say they don't like something!) and we ordered the chicken plate and the deep friend turkey plate.  They brought out a cinnamon and sugar muffin and a biscuit. If these things were warmed I would've cancelled the order and just eaten these. That biscuit with a little butter and the blackberry jam they provides? Best thing there. Nice to see a local business provided the jams, too. So the turkey was....ok. Deep frying didn't do anything for it, I think. Two of the pieces were so dried out that I couldn't cut them. The cornbread stuffing was not to my liking but that's probably because cornbread stuffing isn't the way I prefer my stuffing so don't judge it by that if you like it. There was no cranberry sauce (really? With a turkey plate?) or mashed potatoes - which turned out to be a good thing. My partner's chicken was pretty basic. Smallish chicken cutlets, fried, over mashed potatoes and services with haricot verts. They called them thin green beans for the people who don't know French food terms. It was all....ok. Except when I tried the mashed potatoes and realized they were INSTANT. We all know what instant potatoes taste a like. A $13 lunch plate with 2 small cutlets, some, ahem, thin green beans and a scoop of mashed and you couldn't give REAL potatoes? That's unforgivable. I should've gotten some with my turkey but I'm glad I didn't.  All in all, with 2 sodas, it was $31. I can think of about 20 places to spend that kind of money on lunch and get something tastier - starting with my favorite pizza place. Ice hears they do a great dinner and I see them on the a Restaurant Week list. It seems like a fool of the dice for me. I might skip further visits. All because of those mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"This is a neat little restaurant in the Arboretum Shopping Center. There aren't many of this type of upscale southern cooking in Charlotte. At least, I haven't seen any around. The atmosphere is great. They've got live bands playing occasionally. The food is actually quite good. One thing is that the portions aren't great and the price is a bit on the high side. The dishes are well plated, and you can tell they put time into the preparation of not only for taste, but also aesthetics.   The few times I've gone I ordered the fried chicken appetizer. That is very good. The chicken is tender and well marinated, and the breading is near perfect. For the main course I've ordered a fish dish. It was pretty good. I've also ordered the shrimp and grits. I believe that may be the signature southern dish. It was delicious. They lose a star due to portion size, but otherwise this restaurant is superb."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined at the place on a whim last year during restaurant week. Boy were we pleasantly surprised. Despite it being a busy Saturday evening, we were seated pretty quickly in the bar area without reservations. The restaurant week deal was great, I believe we got something like 4 courses and a free glass of wine for around $30. Everything we ordered was delicious. The manager made a point to come by our table and chat. I honestly have nothing bad to say about this place. Great food and good service. We'll definitely be back when visiting the Queen City."}
{"text":"OMG!!! I'm sure you can look at the name and easily mistake this place for some \"good eatin\"...but then you walk in and realize that the $10 lunch buffet only has 8 items. So as we did, you might THINK that the menu selection will be a little bigger but it's NOT!!! My mom and I actually got 1 thing from each category except \"sandwiches\". As my starter I had the \"exotic mushrooms\" which had NO taste! That was ok because unlike others I can appreciate the natural taste of foods but this was going a little far. Then we had \"soup & salad\"-Arugula & Brunswick Stew. The soup was OK but the salad only had oil as the dressing so it tasted like NOTHING. Then we got our entree...I had the shrimp & grits with sausage and my mom tried the crab cakes with grits and green beans. I tasted her food first and I was immediately turned off! The grits were tasteless and so were the crabcakes. Atleast the green beans had great texture! LOL! My cheese grits were tasteless as well, along with the shrimp. The gravy and the sausage had flavor but not enough to compensate for the rest of the dish. I have NEVER said any food didn't taste like anything but this was a FIRST. I know how to add flavor without salt and I don't think they do. There was no onion, garlic, herb or spice in those dishes. LOL I will NEVER go back unless a person dear to my heart BEGS me to go with them & even then I will not pay for my own food!"}
{"text":"I expected to dislike New South. I've been living in the South for thirteen years now, and as a Northern transplant, I've come to appreciate that not all Southern cooking means meatloaf and mac n' cheese. I had my suspicions that New South would be the kind of place that would try an upscale approach to Southern comfort food, which often times takes the \"comfort\" out of the dish.  New South does exactly that, blend an upscale approach with a respect for traditional Southern cooking. And it left me pleasantly surprised.   Take their fried green tomatoes, for example. A fairly standard dish, yet in their capable hands, a delectible, savory starter that had me sopping up the crumbs with their homemade bread. I say this with no reservation: Best Fried Green Tomatoes Ever!  The shrimp and grits also left me pleasantly surprised. Instead of what we've come to expect, a dish that's often left floating in a mass of gooey cream sauce, the chef tempers the dish in a delicious light mushroom sauce, thich enough to give the grits that consistency the dish needs. I thoroughly enjoyed this new approach to a classic dish.    The dessert, a dish of fried blueberry pie coupled with a scoop of homemade vanilla ice cream, was to die for. The perfect ending to a surprising dinner.  I'm looking forward to dining at New South again."}
{"text":"The food from start to end was amazing.  The pork belly sliders were tender and absolutely delicious.  Our entrees were fantastic.  The unique flavors of my flounder on a bed of limas and risotto blew me away.  The vegetable sides were lightly oiled and served perfectly.   This restaurant has easily become a favorite for our date nights."}
{"text":"A wonderful restaurant. They change up the menu to use fresh items and have a wonderful viewpoint in the preparation. Sue is the best - friendly and fun-- and her Hubby is executive cook extraordnaire. Great wine specials!"}
{"text":"Very good meal - lots of locally grown ingredients on the menu, very good service - great all around.  I had the pork shoulder with some vegetables and it was out-freaking-standing.  I was going to order the chicken, but because it is fresh (not frozen - locally grown), it takes 25 minutes or so. and we had to get crackin' so couldn't wait.  The server got everything right out and everything was perfect.  I love that so much of the food is local - we need to support that."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in Charlotte. With their good service, locally sourced ingredients, and extensive beer menu, this is a favorite date-night spot for us."}
{"text":"Traditional southern \"meat-and-three\" meets everything fine dining has to offer at the corner of Pineville Matthews and Providence Road. I would be reaching to find one thing wrong with the overall experience my wife and I had last night at New South Kitchen.   Prompt service in a casual atmosphere set the tone for the night. Our server was on point the whole time, from the time she took drink orders to the bill presentation. When she came to take our dinner order, I had 3 menu items picked, and they all sounded so good I was prepared to order all three. However, our server was able to present and sell the chef's special (soft shell crab) so effectively I went with one of those instead. I love a server who can knowledgeably sell her chef's inspirations. And I was rewarded for my choice with two soft shell crabs that were fried to perfection and so big the legs were hanging off the plate! Fantastic.   I recommend the grilled romaine salad as a starter. Their flank steak was amazing as well...it's very easy to turn flank steak into a piece of rubber...but this flank steak was tender and juicy. Substitute the roasted sweet potatoes for the grits...alot of places frown on substitutions, but this place is more than happy to accommodate. Also, they have daily rotating specials...sort of an homage to the southern country kitchens of old.   Wait...I remember now...there was one thing wrong with the overall experience. There was a hole in the booth's seat. Do I care about the hole? No.  Go to New South and have a great, Southern-fried experience."}
{"text":"We were excited to try this restaurant for brunch as a friend recommended it, although she hadn't been there in a while, which might explain things, I'm not certain if something changed in between when she went and when we went, but, we didn't have a very pleasant experience. We went here on Easter Sunday after church and walked to the hostess stand to inquire of a table. There was one family of 4 waiting in that area, no one else. We were asked if we had a reservation and we said no, we did not. We were then informed, quite rudely, that the only place they could seat us was outside on the front patio facing the parking lot. I turned around and looked again at the family of 4 and thought to myself, that's interesting, it isn't like you have a long wait or anything, and if THEY were sitting there waiting for an interior table then THEY must have had a reservation from what the hostess just told us. Okay, we said, seat us outside, A bit chilly that day, but not really an issue for our party of 3. Service by our waiter was EXCELLENT, for having to go in and out so many times through the front doors and his friendliness and professionalism. He gets 5 stars. The food and the hostesses, not so much. I ordered a huevos rancheros and first off, the portion was that of less than a child's plate. Oh well, I though, keeps my caloric intake in check I guess. The eggs were completely overcooked, the salsa nearly non-existent, a few teensy pieces of cilantro tossed on and the \"tortilla strips\" were tossed on as an afterthought. The plate was served messy, zero appeal whatsoever. The potatoes underneath were totally overcooked and burnt. My daughter had a pasta dish that was oversauced and the chicken overcooked in it. My better half had hash and eggs, with his eggs also overcooked and the hash was really only cubed potatoes like mine were, and overdone. A final note on the \"reservations\" needed, we noted that maybe, just maybe, a total of 5-6 families go inside when we were there, 2 of those families seated outside in the same patio area as we were. Going inside to use the restroom and taking a quick peek at the dining room, it was only 3/4 full, plenty of space to have put us at a table. Now that's frustrating. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Visited on a Saturday, a little after 5:30 pm. I was with my husband and two kids. The restaurant was pretty empty since it wasn't dinner time yet. The hostess asked if I had a reservation, which I replied no. She made a sigh and said she will see what she can do and stared down at her paper for a very long time. After waiting a while, I walked over to the dining area and there was only one couple sitting down , all other tables and booths were completely empty. I kindly let her know the dining room was empty to which she responded \"those are all reserved, I'm still looking to see if we can seat you\". She finally said she found a spot and sat us at a table. At this point I told my husband I didn't even want to eat there anymore due to her bad attitude but he told me to give them a chance; luckily our waiter was the complete opposite of the hostess and was very pleasant. We had the BBQ burger, chicken and waffles, and Mac n cheese.... everything was phenomenal. Service time was also great, we were in/out in less than an hour. Additionally when we left, there were still over 8 tables/booths empty. I'm not sure what the hostess' issue was but I'm glad I did not let her bad attitude drive us away from a great meal."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful lunch here today! I ordered one of the  specials of the day-porgy (a white fish) over spinach & grits-and it was delicious! Also, we had a small plate of the pimento cheese with pita to share...really tasty! My fellow diners ordered a burger and the florentine omelette...they were both very happy with their dishes."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars.  Been wanting to go here for a while and Saturday night Turned out to be the night we finally went.  Boy, sure glad we did.  The food was tremendous, our server was really good and we got something we don't find a lot of in restaurants - value.  Started with the deviled eggs and they are a must.  6 halves, 2 of each kind - regular, pickle and bacon. MMM.  I had the crawfish bisque and this is the reason for the 1/2 star off.  Taste was really solid, but it was a little thin for a bisque and there were no chunks of crawfish in it.  Not a one.  For dinner, my daughter had a burger.  I tried a bite and it was tremendous.  Someone put on a review of this place that the burgers were the best around.  Not sure if they are the best, but they are really up there.  I had shrimp and grits which were great, even though they were in a brown gravy.  Wife is dairy free and they were so accommodating to make the braised short ribs without the dairy.  Killer good, be they are off the chart if you get them made the regular way.  Last but absolutely not least was dessert - fried blueberry pie!  Are you kidding me?  think of a hostess pie from when you were a kid, deep fry it, sprinkle cinnamon sugar on top and oh yeah, lop a scoop of some of the best vanilla ice cream on it.  OYE!!!  First time there, definitely not the last."}
{"text":"This was one of the best dinners I've had out in a long time.  We had the zucchini fries and pimento cheese small plates to start.  Both were wonderful!! I got a mushroom burger which was awesome and he had the trout which was delicious.  And for dessert we ate the chocolate mouse which again was perfect.  We are definitely coming back again.  The staff was pleasant and I couldn't be happier with our experience."}
{"text":"My wife and I met a dear friend here for dinner. We were ultimately delayed by 45 mins. thanks to Charlotte traffic and the location isn't the easiest to find in the Arboretum shopping center (Charlotte, NC).   The ambiance was quiet and a bit dim. The noise level was respectfully at a murmur, although I can't say if it's because of the interior spaciousness or the lack of full tables. Either way, we definitely enjoyed the serene atmosphere.  Our menu selections were beef tenderloin salad for myself; the  NC mountain trout for my wife and the bistro chicken (Tues. night special) for our friend. Overall, the food was delicious and well-prepared. The prices were in-line with the quality and depth of food flavors.  As this is a bit more 'fancy' than my wife and I enjoy, it was nice to experience it."}
{"text":"I'm a good ol' southern boy born and raised in NC. The food I had tonight at New South Kitchen & Bar scratched my homegrown itch.  Walking in we were greeted and quickly seated. The style is modern southern. Classy, but not stuffy. Our server was prompt and pleasant and reviewed the specials with us. I opted for the pork cutlets with bacon and tomato jam. I ordered a side of collard greens to go with.  While waiting fresh biscuits and whipped butter was served. They were light, fluffy, and delicious. I could have been happy with a basket of biscuits for my meal.   The cutlets arrived next, and they looked wonderful. Two thin cutlets were stacked and topped with mushrooms, diced country ham, bacon and tomato jam, and a thin brown gravy. The dish looked wonderful, and tasted even better. The pork was cooked perfectly. The bacon and tomato jam was so savory and made a nice addition to the pork. My side of collard greens was perfect too. They were seasoned very well and didn't need any extra salt, pepper, or vinegar. They were soft but firm, not mushy.   I will definitely return to New South Kitchen & Bar. Their menu has lots of items I'd like to try. I give this one 5 stars y'all."}
{"text":"It's the kinda place where you want to eat your way through the menu. So much flavor! I also really enjoyed the atmosphere in this tucked away gem."}
{"text":"New South unfortunately no longer offers the RSVP menu I wrote about in 2010, but their food is still delicious.  Their old deal comes back for restaurant week, though, for $30.  Went for brunch a few weeks ago, and was impressed.  The brioche french toast was flavorful, light, and fluffy.  The mini muffins I ordered on the side came out warm, and were a great serving of totally unnecessary additional carbs.  As was the biscuit that I ordered.  For $0.50 for a muffin or biscuit, why not?  My girlfriend got the eggs benedict - definitely not traditional, as it was served with pulled pork instead of ham, and on top of grit cakes, instead of English muffins.  The red potatoes side was perfectly cooked, as well.  Girlfriend couldn't finish all of the potatoes, so what the hell, more carbs for brunch!  They still have a great beer selection - all but one draft was from a Charlotte brewery, and the final draft was from another NC brewery.  In fact, each Charlotte distributing-brewery (Four Friends, NoDa, OMB, Birdsong) was represented."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner the weekend before Christmas with my aunt.  We made reservations through open table and even got an email confirmation.  When we got there, they had no record of our reservation, so we had to sit at a high top table in the bar.  No big deal, but there are reasons why you make reservations.  We started off with the deviled eggs and and pimento cheese wontons.  Both were good, but the wontons were not cheesy or what I expected, just had a pimento cheese decorative sauce line on the plate rather than on or in the wontons.  Also kind of pricey when you only get three.  For dinner we ordered the chicken and waffles, pork chop and pork shoulder and split three sides - squash, succotash, and mac and cheese.  The chicken and waffles were good, but I've had better.  The jalapeno jelly was too spicy and I like spicy foods.  The pork chop was okay, but loved the pork shoulder!!  The sides were just okay to me, nothing outstanding and pretty pricey for the small amount you get on one plate.  Would we be back?  Sure, but it won't be my first thought."}
{"text":"Six of us had dinner here the other night. Very extensive food and wine menu with an additional specials menu.  Most of us got the fried chicken which was overcooked and just ok. You get three big pieces, more than you can eat at one sitting, but since it was overdone you didn't want to bring leftovers home.  Along with the chicken was mashed potatoes and gravy and some really nice green beans -- the beans were the best part of the plate.  Salads were pretty standard fare.   For a place that emphasizes organic ingredients something didn't quite come together. It's a tad pricey and the dishes sound better on the menu than they taste in actuality. Nothing wrong, but nothing to get sparked about.  Ended the meal with beignets and a dipping sauce. Should have been a happy indulgent end to the meal, but like all the other dishes, will be damned with faint praise."}
{"text":"Front of the house poorly managed. Arrived and told that we would be seated within 15 minutes.  Many empty tables available. After 30 minutes we left without being served. Most tables with diners still had no food. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I would love to actually eat here, but the 2 times we've visited we have been seated and then waited nearly 10 minutes without seeing a single server. We have left both times without having placed so much as a drink order."}
{"text":"This place was great! My boyfriend and I were in town from California and happened into here. My chicken was the best I have ever had and my boyfriend who is from North Carolina said the fried green tomatoes and  sour cream apple pie were the best he has had. I would recommend this to anyone who loves good food."}
{"text":"Came in here a few weeks ago for a late lunch and really enjoyed it!  There isn't all that many options in this area and we decided on here my sister had been in the past and suggested it for a quick bite. The decor is southwestern and a pretty nice size dining area.  We started off with Pork Spring Rolls which were great and an afterthought so we were happy we added them!! We both had the Grilled Chicken Sandwich with your choice of a side I had the Brussel Sprouts and she had the mushroom Risotto and they were great!!   If your in the area I would defiantly recommend checking it out for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"OMG This place is awefull!!  If these people call this good southern food then I am ashamed to call myself a southerner. Food was bland. IT ALSO WAS NOT FRESH!! We had the meat loaf, and shrimp and grits. Yuck!! Talk about poor quality and taste. The grits were soupy, watery. The meat loaf tasted like a ball of meat with ketchup on it. I ate what I was given but I wish I would not have wasted my time or money. They can take my picture, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Had a great anniversary meal #NewSouthKitchen&Bar.  Great food and service from Kelsey.  Had reservation and walked right in. Apps: Crab Cake and awesome cheese platter. I had the flank steak special w/ side of roasted beets.  Kim has big Pickle Burger, it was huge.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Not very interesting execution of their lunch items. Smoked trout spread was heavy on the mayo. But, very nice staff!"}
{"text":"We went here for an early dinner. The place was confusing as far as decor goes. The bar area had one vibe and then the dining area had old looking booths that were a bit dated. We got small plates for our meal and shared between the two of us. We left feeling hungry and like we wasted our money.   Deviled eggs-Too mustardy for my liking Pulled pork egg rolls- The favorite at the table. Not bad but not worth the price Grilled romaine- bad version of a caesar salad. It didn't have a good taste. BBQ Shrimp- my favorite they were pretty good, but barely luke warm Fried green tomatoes- bland breading, disappointing sauce  It was a complete miss for me and my boyfriend. I do not think we will make it back."}
{"text":"This is a really nice little sort of Nuevo Southern place but unlike most Nuevo - whatever places it doesn't try too hard it's reasonably priced and pretty much seems to get it right. Our lunch started with some yummy biscuits with apple butter and a three berry (I think three) jelly. I couldn't decide which I liked more. I went with the Lemon Pepper chicken sandwich with fries both were delicious. Mom had the  chicken salad also delicious. The service was fast and friendly. So give them a try next time you think you want Le Peep they're right next door."}
{"text":"Everything we had was fantastic!  If you are reading reviews here, you already know what this place is about so I will spare you further explanation.  We shared: Brie & Crackers, Shrimp and Grits, Grilled Romaine, and (awesome) Penne Mac & Cheese along with a couple of local beers.  The food was dynamite, and all (except the Brie) from a short menu they use during weird hours like Sunday afternoon before dinner.  So many places are CLOSED during this time, so I applaud them for being open.  Our server was great, too!  Enjoyed sitting outside in the nice weather, wish it was more ambient than an active shopping center parking lot.  Maybe some iron railing would help?  Plants?  Sadly, we saved no room for dessert - the choices sure sounded good.  We've already made a plan to return!"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time last night. We were glad we did.  Interior is fine, but maybe a little underwhelming for the price point.  Fried green tomatoes were good but a little bland and slightly undercooked but still good. Shrimp and grits were some of the best we've ever had. Chicken and waffles were best I've ever had. Biggest star was the grilled pound cake with blackberries. It was awesome. Service was good too. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and the food and service has always been consistently good.  It is southern recipes with a modern flair.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"David and I have eaten here many times and  overall, we like the place. However, I would probably give it only 3.5 stars because on several visits, the service has really been been hit or miss.  (This visit was so-so, but last time, we had great service).    Overall, the food is good, but the major limiting factor for me is that they put bacon in almost everything here, which really limits my choices. (Ok folks, we get that this is \"Southern cuisine\" but really, give us a break with the pork already!)    But, on the upside, they have a nice wine list.   Tonight we had the B.R. Cohn Cabernet Sauvignon which was a beautifully balanced wine. David decided to have a burger and the creamed corn.  I tasted his corn and it was flavorful but not at all creamy.  I would have been disappointed if I had chosen this side dish.  Usually I order the trout or whatever fish is on the menu at the time. However, on this visit,  I went for the daily special which was deep fried turkey  breast served with dressing (studded with cranberries) and fresh green beans on the side. (This dish normally comes with \"Southern beans\" which is cooked with bacon but they substituted the fresh green beans since they are not cooked with bacon.)    They are also now serving brunch on Sat & Sun - since brunch is one of our favorite meals on the weekend,  we'll definitely be back to check that out!"}
{"text":"I went here a couple of months after it opened and had mixed experiences.  So we did not visit for 4ish years. But now we enjoy going and enjoy the creative menu.  We usually sit in the bar area. We have had great to inattentive service. The food is creative but lacks execution to the the description.  Boiled peanut hummus was great.  A waiter taking care of their co-worker over us was not. I hope the owners can get the staff to be better professionals when they are not there.  The blonde bar tender is so aloof and inattentive, but it seems she is in charge.   Why can't Charlotte have Charleston standards of restaurants even when we have four culinary schools?"}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch here on Sunday.  The biscuits, besides my mom's, were probably the best we've had. My husband ordered the meatloaf and I had the fried chicken.  Both were excellent. Love that they try and use local farmers."}
{"text":"Screaming children ruined otherwise good dining experience. When owner was asked to deal with situation, she refused, saying it was \"awkward\" for her. A skilled manager/owner would know how to handle this situation. Our table of six will not be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I were given a gift card for New South as a welcome gift to the neighborhood. The restaurant came highly recommended and it did not disappoint. We had an amazingly friendly waitress, wonderful ambiance, and fantastic food. I had the Cobia special and it was cooked to perfection. It's one of the few places I've been able to find such a unique fish in the Queen City. This will be a staple for my family for years to come!"}
{"text":"Updated 3/2012.  Charlotte now has many good restaurants but I find that after a few years I tire of my current favorite place and move on; this has not happened at New South. Their food at dinner is always good and nobody in Charlotte makes better vegetables; they have a dinner special for $25 or $30 that includes a glass of wine and dessert you can't beat that price for the quality of food that they deliver. That is one kitchen that delivers above their price level. Best breakfast in Charlotte! I have always liked this restaurant for dinner as their kitchen delivers at a much higher level then their prices but this morning I tried their breakfast   for the first time and it is outstanding, plus reasonable. I had my standard American breakfast of eggs, meat, potatoes (as good as they get), biscuit. Even the small fruit salad on the side, which normally I push to the edge of my plate, was five stars and I could have eaten a bowl full. The menu also covered your standard brunch fare but I will let someone else review that as I will stick to my American blue collar breakfast. You will find my American pickup truck parked in front on any given Saturday morning while I enjoy the best breakfast in town. On Sunday their wines by the glass are half price, so that is where I have my dinner on every Sunday. They are open daily but only on Saturday and Sunday for breakfast/brunch. Enjoy."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent, however the menu is somewhat limited. I have been coming for about 2 years now and there have not been a tremendous amount of changes and there's not a lot of choices to begin with. However,  the food that you do get is excellent & very fresh.   All produce and many goods as possible are purchased from local farmers and producers. As far as I'm concerned that makes it worth it."}
{"text":"Super nice service and food is awesome! Farm to table without breaking the bank. Fried green tomatoes and black and blue burger are tasty! Nice craft beer selection for those interested. Will definitely come back again and again!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I was thoroughly impressed. Came at a weird time of day (around 2:30) so it wasn't crowded at all. So many things on the menu looked so delicious and I would love to come back for dinner next time. I got the chicken salad sandwich and French fries, and for a small eater, I finished the whole plate!! It was really really good! The fries were crispy and salty, just the way I like them. Our server was fantastic and our food was brought out quickly. Like I said, I definitely want to come back here again and try some dinner entrees!"}
{"text":"We went here a few weeks ago. All I really remember is that the night was unmemorable. I had high expectations and left a little disappointed. Not that I won't ever go back, but it's not my first choice."}
{"text":"Four stars for lunch, five stars for brunch. Ive enjoyed every dish Ive had here but the reason that I rate New South slighty lower for lunch is that the small plates are a bit overpriced which is unfortunate since the small plates are actually better than the big entrees. I love making a meal of a few small plates for he variety-I sometimes get taste fatigue-but at New South, the prices make that hard to do.   Now that Ive gotten the negative out of the way, Ill go to the positive and talk about my favorite dishes. The pulled pork spring rolls are excellent. Sometimes pork is dry and tasteless but the pork here is tender and bursting with flavor and that already excellent flavor is enhanced by the sweet chili sauce that it's served with. When I go for small plates, I usually get the spring rolls and the fried green tomatoes. My favorite entree is the pecan crusted trout. I adore nut encrusted fish since the nuts give it texture and crunch without having to deep fry. This dish seems to be prepared slightly differently everytime I go but its always awesome. Ive had it topped with lemon butter sauce and Ive also had it topped with tabasco aoili. The veggies that are offered as side dishes are always super fresh since they come from local farms but since side dishes are five dollars a piece (!!!), i only eat them when they come with my entree  Brunch is more affordable than lunch and the dishes remain great. I like to start my brunch by ordering a basket of muffins (you can also buy an individual muffin for 50 cents if you dont have a big group though they dont advertise this on the menu). They rotate the muffin flavors and the coffee cake ones are devine. The stand out brunch dish is the Southern eggs benedict. This dish consists of grit cakes topped with pulled pork, eggs, and Hollandaise sauce. The combination of flavors is amazing-I dont usually go for egg dishes because eggs are so plain tasting but the combination of the eggs, the juicy pork, and the lemony Hollandaise is supremely enjoyable. This dish also allows me to enjoy the same delicious pork that is in the aforementioned spring rolls in a dish thats much more filling and substantial. Charlotte has a lot of great brunch places but I think New South has the best."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant yesterday. It is in the Arboretum. The restaurant has a nice decor  and is very clean. It was early afternoon and the restaurant was not very crowded. The young lady that helped me at the bar was very attentive, friendly and nice. She recommended the shrimp and grits. She was spot on. The meal was absolutely delicious. I also got an appetizer of their deviled eggs. They also were very tasty - my favorite one was with bacon. If you're near the Arboretum give this place a chance. I don't think that you will be disappointed. I've lived in Charlotte for 10 years and can't believe that I'd never dined here before. I will be back and try some more options. The time that I was visiting they had a limited menu. But, I was told that they also have a more extensive menu at later times. I was also told they have a brunch."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  My favorite thing here is the grilled romaine salad.  I think if the location was different, such as Uptown or on East/South Blvd it would be impossible to get a reservation!"}
{"text":"New South is awesome!! Just go and enjoy one Charlotte's very best restaurants. Great bar, great service and the food is always delicious."}
{"text":"Have been to this restaurant quite a few times, most recently this past weekend. Food is always delicious and service great. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went there on a first date and had the Crab Cakes and Salad.  Was wonderful and the service was great too! Very classy and modern but felt downhome as well."}
{"text":"My new fave joint. From the fried green tomatoes to the charred salad, I am in love with place. My friend is still talking about the chicken snd waffles.   The staff is knowledgable and pleasant. If you're looking for the normal fare, don't bother coming here. This food is fresh, local, and tasty."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place!! The service was good, although the manager who was walking around seemed like he'd rather be at home then there lol.  Food wise I cannot wait to go back!! I had the  meatloaf which I know a lot of people raved about and honestly it was fantastic. Loved it :-)  My friends had the pan fried chicken and the pork chop item currently on the menu. The pork chop was phenomenal, it's a feature menu item right now so I'll be back to have it before it goes away!! Pan fried chicken was also delicious.  As far as small plates go we got the pork mustard bbq sliders and the chicken wontons. The chicken wontons were on the bottom of the totum pole for me as far as everything we got but the sliders were delicious!!   I can't wait to go back and try some of there other tasty tasty food and I\"m so glad I finally got over there to try it!!"}
{"text":"We had a great lunch today at New South.  We had never been here before but will definitely be back.  I had the grilled chicken wrap with fries and my husband ordered the New South burger.  The wrap was good but the burger was excellent. The burger was one of the best I have had in Charlotte - it is topped with pimento cheese and bacon.  The waiter told me the buns were made in house by the chef.  The fries were perfectly salted.  They also give complimentary homemade biscuits - I wish they served these with something other than regular butter but they were pretty good.  We will for sure be back and next time I'm getting the burger!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love New South.  I *still* want to love New South.  Alas... meh.  Located in the back section of the Arboretum with most of the restaurants (right next to Le Peep, and if you hit the car place, you've gone too far), the parking lot appears to have been designed by Helen Keller - but the Arbo parking has been a wreck for 20+ years.  I was greeted immediately by the friendly hostess and quickly seated.  The chair did not find my fat ass to be a fun way to spend the evening and creaked every time I moved.   It's embarrassing to be sitting by yourself in the middle of a restaurant talking to a wooden chair, pleading with it not to splinter.  Nice, simple interior, I liked the framed pictures on the wall.  There was a wall-length cabinet full of wine.  The table closest to me seemed to have regulars at it, which is typically a good sign, though with my early arrival time of 5:45, there were only a couple of other tables seated.    The menu was a simple 1 legal sized sheet of paper with a handful of choices for cheeses/charcuterie, small plates, salads, sandwiches and entrees.  I had checked out the menu online, so I was pretty sure I knew what I was getting already.    The food: A basket containing two thick slices of warm bread with soft butter was brought to the table.  The bread was good, nothing special or unusual, but warm and tasty.  I am not sure if the butter was a flavored butter, but I didn't like the taste.  I ate the bread plain. Pork belly sliders:  I have never had pork belly sliders, though they are on every non-chain menu in Charlotte.  I was told by a friend that it is sort of like BBQ.  It is most assuredly *nothing* like BBQ.  It seems that I like every part of the pig except for the belly (how can something so close to the bacon be so NOT bacon?!).  It was unpleasant for me, but that is a matter of my taste and not the execution of the dish - they very well could be delicious for what they are, but I have nothing to judge them by and I plan on never intentionally eating pork belly ever again.  Not ever.   Pan fried chicken:  Pan fried chicken is usually a little darker than deep fried, so I was expecting it to be a little more done than something the Colonel dishes up. Two small breasts, pan fried, served on a bed of mashed potatoes and a smidge of gravy with a layer of collard greens.  Chicken was tasty, crust stayed on the chicken for the most part, mashed potatoes were creamy, but nothing magical, gravy was sparse, collard greens were well flavored with only the slightest vinegary hint.  Plated well, but zzzzzzzzz  My server rattled off some desserts for me that all sounded wonderful, included a fried blueberry pie (hello!), but I was ready to call it a night.  My waitress was friendly and efficient and when I made a face at the almost full plate of sliders when she picked it up, I admitted to her that pork belly was not what I thought it was.  When I was through with my meal and she brought the check, without me asking she had taken the sliders off.  I asked that she please not do that, as it was my fault for not knowing what it was, but she said it was taken care of.  Excellent customer service - so I feel even worse about not being wowed.  I am guessing the gentleman circulating checking on everyone was the owner, he was very pleasant and was making sure everyone was happy.   All of the staff was wonderful.    I want to go back and maybe try another dish, I really did enjoy the restaurant itself and the employees were a delight.  I might need to return just to try the fried blueberry pie and then update my review."}
{"text":"Ahh... the South.  As a girl from the Appalachian Mountain culture, southern food is in my blood.  When a restaurant claims they're putting a new spin on what I often consider perfection, I'm often skeptical.  New South, however, knows what they're doing.  I had lunch here with three other friends a few days before Christmas.  The menu isn't huge, but it had a nice variety.  I saw several things I would like to go back to try.  This day, somehow the fried chicken dish was calling our names.  All four of us ordered it!    To start we had the fried green tomatoes.  I've lived my entire life in the south and can say with total confidence, these were THE BEST fried green tomatoes I've ever had!  They were simply perfect!  Our chicken entree was equally good.  The breading was a little crunchy, the gravy was amazing, and the mashed potatoes were silky and creamy.  I tried the brussel sprouts with mine and loved them.    We enjoyed good service, yummy bread and we all felt the prices were good, too.  Check out this great little gem at the Arboretum.  For me, New South is a new favorite."}
{"text":"My new favorite place! So impressed. The food is exceptional. The food is all locally sourced and the beef is grass fed. Every single item was my favorite. And, you cannot leave without having dessert. Truly wonderful. Everything is made from scratch. You can taste the love."}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant is amazing!  Everything my husband and I had exceeded our expectations.  It was very fresh and I love how they use locally sourced ingredients and grass fed beef.  Their sustainable fish from NC comes in fresh daily.  It is too bad that this restaurant is not somewhere like Ballantyne with more space.  The food is so good but the restaurant is so small and kind of hidden at the Arboretum.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because of the lack of friendliness of the staff.  The nicest person we had contact with was Lauren but we were disappointed by the rest of the staff.  They seem to all be rather curt, not at all personable and just lack customer service.  For the caliber of food they should have service more like the server we had at Vivace.  That server took the time to welcome us, go over the menu and specials, make recommendations and was extremely courteous.  The food as I said was some of the best I've had in Charlotte.  Probably the only place comparable is Customshop.  The service is just not inviting and didn't wow us.  If they could get some more space and train their staff on customer service or hire new people they would do really well.  Give it a try.  The food is worth it!  I want to go back for breakfast and lunch.  i just wish I could help them in the areas where they are weak.  I would love to see a restaurant like this have multiple locations.  It is so hard to find fresh food, made from scratch, without all kinds of junk, processed ingredients."}
{"text":"I would really give 4.5 stars on this one. The only reason I can't give 5 is because they have a patio in front however they were not staffed to serve on the patio on a Saturday night, with great weather. We did have the option to sit outside but service could have been really slow.   Now, on the very positive side. Let me start with our server, Mike. He was very attentive and very personable!  We had my 1 year old granddaughter with us and when he noticed we didn't have the kids menu he made suggestions.    We shared small plates--grilled romaine salad, fried green tomatoes, pulled pork spring rolls, and pork belly.  They were all amazing and couldn't pick one favorite.   At the end of the meal Mike made mention that since we obviously liked wine that they offer 1/2 price wine by the glass on Sunday and 1/2 price bottles on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"This place is smart, tasteful and makes me excited about food again. We just returned from Las Vegas, land of over priced restaurants and uninspired buffets. Our last meal was at Gordon Ramsay's steak. The food was small lacking flavor and three times the price I would have paid for the meal. New south Kitchen is everything food should be. Brave and bold and organic and fresh. My pork chop was cooked perfect and perfectly paired with its sides of cream corn and kale and pink lady field peas. This is a perfect date place  craft beers bustling bar and a nice moody atmosphere. Leave the kids at home for this one although they have a kid menu that is nicely priced it is not where their strength lies. Look at my reviews, I rarely give 5 stars but the New South Kitchen deserves 6!  Hurry and get here you are missing out!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, our food was overpriced and over salted. We got small plates - scallops, pork belly, and pulled pork spring rolls as well as a special. We decided not to order full meals afterwards because the food was just not great. Was so hopeful because of the locally sourced meats but it just wasn't yummy to us."}
{"text":"2nd time I'm here and always greeted right away. Nice to have a different style of food, delicious Southern style for a change. Nice having lunch with my son!! I ordered the chicken wrap. Wishing the food would come out just a little bit quicker, but on that note!!!! Delicious"}
{"text":"Fantastic! We had the fried turkey, pan fried chicken and pimento burger.  Amazing food and definitely a new go to place!!!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent!  Customer service is on point!  Try the pull pork egg roll... Ummmm...absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I can see the appeal of the more unusual items on the limited menu, but the portion sizes were small and taste was a bit bland. I'd recommend the pork belly sliders and Brussel sprouts. With some more work this could become a real hotspot."}
{"text":"Nice neighborhood place.  Pretty quiet and low key in the arboretum but really tasty food.  I seriously can wait to go back to try more of what was on the menu!  On this occasion I had the fried okra salad and a green tomato and shrimp soup.  Both of which were unexpected and tasty!  The decor reminded me of a place I've been in Asheville.  Not super fancy but nice.  The menu was interesting and I totally get with they named it new south putting a nice flare on simple southern cuisine.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is a delicious restaurant, I highly recommend it. Not a huge selection but everything looks delicious, I had a hard time deciding on what to order. I had the small plate of fried green tomatoes, eggs Savannah and beignets. It was all good! The service was excellent in addition to the fabulous food!"}
{"text":"The big and small plates were great.... BBQ shrimp and the cheese plate with only the cheddar. I had the veggie plate with squash (zucchini and yellow a little chunky but good), mac n cheese (penne and velveta-esq) and collard greens ( they were great. not too bitter I like the vinegar approach)  my dining buddy had the fried chicken. It was flavorful and tender. The mashed potatoes were homemade and the green beans were not cooked to death.... The bread was bland and not warm as others have stated. Both big and small plates were Delish...    The service sucked. When we first entered we were told that a table needed to be prepared. The hostess walks away and comes back. We were seated next to a fly inhabited window. Which was more so annoying than disgusting.... Ok it was actually both. We weren't up sold on wine or cocktails even tea. We were given the pitcher of water and that was it.  We ordered our small plates and then we were asked if he wanted to take our menus. Do ppl only order small plates here? We want to eat its 7:00 in the evening... After a bit of observing I realized that the tables are already preset and there were only about 5 other taken tables. Why we had to wait for a table to be put together? I'm not sure. We heard about the snapper special and soup of the day from the same server seating the table behind us.  Boooooooo Scott... I'll try again with a different dining buddy on a busier day and see if anything changes. For now you get 3 stars and that is because the food was delicious.  #MaybeNextTime"}
{"text":"New South's menu is made surrounding seasonal ingredients from the Carolinas. They take pride in supporting family owned farms that use sustainable, all natural farming methods. They make sure the beef, pork and poultry they acquire are raised with no antibiotics or artificial growth hormones, and they make sure their seafood is sustainably fished or farmed in Carolina waters. They even have a gluten free menu!   New South is most known for their deviled egg appetizer. This comes with 2 eggs of each: traditional, bacon, and pickle stuffing. Their yolk stuffing is unique in that you can taste a kick of mustard! I also recommend their other popular appetizer, the Pork Belly. This dish consists of pork belly cubes on top of sweet potato and pecan salad, and an orange glaze. The Pork Loin is arguable the best entree on the menu. A nice sized filet of pork is laid on top of baked mac and cheese, collards, bbq jus, and topped with apple chutney. The sauce on here -- sweet apple with a hint of spice -- really makes the dish!"}
{"text":"This place has one of my very favorite salads in Charlotte (FRIED OKRA SALAD) but New South only gets 3 stars for my most recent visit solely due to the service.  Our server was as nice as he could be when he was around but it was a challenge getting him there.  An empty wine glass while dining is a pretty big pet peeve of mine.  He did get some brownie points when he offered to make a fresh pot of decaf to go with our very delicious dessert (beignets...OMG!).  SIDENOTE:  Look for coupons.  New South is good about getting in the local Citipass books and other forms of promotional mailers."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, and  and ambiance.  The residence chef/owner preps and cooks the food -clearly with passion.  Ate here 3 times and every time tried something different, always enjoying each meal more."}
{"text":"I'd give this place 3.5 stars but again, Yelp and that too cool for half a star business. I'm giving them four because the service was excellent but the food hews closer to three. No, it wasn't bad but I was a tad underwhelmed. Food was good but nothing stood out and their menu was kinda small. Wings were pretty good, deviled eggs were decent. Had the fried catfish entree which wasn't bad but I've had better at multiple places. In short, yes I'd go back but maybe more so to sit at the bar and enjoy drinks and apps as opposed to a full meal."}
{"text":"I have been dying to go here and finally got the chance to last night for restaurant week. I thought overall the food was good, but it definitely wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Our services was slow too, but we didn't mind as we had a larger group and were enjoying our conversation.  For the starter I had fried green tomatoes. I have never had fried green tomatoes before so I have nothing to compare it to. The tomatoes were hard but tasty and the breading on it wasn't too much. It was definitely lacking in salt and I am not one to ever put salt on my food. My girlfriend that also order the tomatoes and has had them a lot said they weren't that great.  My entree was crab cakes and mac and cheese. The crab cakes were good, but again, I have had better. I did like that they served it with a mustard sauce instead of the remoulde. The mac and cheese was great. It had a few crunchy pieces which I always love and the cheese made it nice and thick.  The dessert was by far my favorite. It was a piece of chocolate mousse cake with raspberries. There is nothing better in this world than chocolate and raspberries.  Overall it was OK food and I may go back again to give it a second chance."}
{"text":"Serendipity blessed us with finding this gem in a strip mall.  We actually tried to visit another place across the parking lot and they couldn't seat us. Thank goodness for that.  As a Manhattanite visiting Charlotte I felt right at home with the decor, the food, the presentation, the menu and the bar.  You could literally plop this place down in mid-town Manhattan, and aside from having to double the prices, you'd be good to go.  The restaurant's name, \"New South,\" describes the concept with the food.  They offer southern favorites that have had the benefit of the diligent application of the collective knowledge and skill of modern restaurant artistry.  Favorites like Mac and Cheese, Deviled Eggs, Pimento Cheese, Meatloaf, Shrimp with Grits, and Fried Okra shimmy into a little black dress and get ready for a chic-chic little West Village party in your mouth.   The deviled eggs were served with pork confit, the mac and cheese had a nice toasty top, the roasted fingerlings were savory and creamy.  They have daily specials and a surprisingly complete prix fixe for $25.  I recommend New South as a place to take your friends who usually turn up their noses at restaurants in suburban strip malls."}
{"text":"We have eaten at New South twice now.  Once for dinner and today for brunch.  Everything is fresh and well prepared.  Pulled pork springrolls, deviled eggs and pimento cheese were tasty small plates.  The chicken and waffles are amazing; pork tenderloin, creamy corn and mac n cheese delicious.  Brunch was just as good, with bacon that definitely had the farm to table freshness and flavor difference. We will be regulars. Don't miss this gem in the Arboretum."}
{"text":"After over a year we finally came back to new south. We had friends visiting from California and wanted to take them to southern food, so we figured this was a good option. I went online and looked to see if reservations were available (it was a Saturday night) and they looked pretty open, so we drove the 10 minutes over to the restaurant. After arrival, there was 1 party seated in the dining room at 6:45. We were told there were no tables available except for a high top at the bar. The table was awkward to dine at as it was much too small for 4 people, and once we left there were more than half of the tables in the restaurant still empty. I guess if you have the option definitely make the reservation. Our waitress was fine, but not extraordinary. Everyone's dishes were plated beautifully but were kind of meh. My trout wasn't seasoned well, my husband's meatloaf was dry, and everyone else was meh about their dishes. The sides were pretty tasty. But overall, after this experience I don't think I'll be back. Especially since Cajun dog is so close and soooo good. I think we just felt like we weren't welcome or appreciated the whole time we were there."}
{"text":"I want to give them that fourth star but we've had just enough mediocre experiences to make that not possible for now. Still, you could havea great time on any given night.  We find the nightly specials to be very worthwhile: Fried chicken on Mondays, St Louis ribs on Wednesdays, and deep fried turkey on Sundays have all been good. The wine list is good as well, and they have beer and wine specials at various times of the week (see their website for details).  We have had one or two nights where the service wasn't the best and one night when the food really wasn't done as requested, or even well. The nights with poor service, I have no idea if this was the fault of the server or the kitchen, but they aren't charging Denny's prices and I do expect better follow-through than we had those nights. For that reason, the fourth star remains to be awarded.  But we'll go back, hoping to have a night that gives us reason to award it."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped here for dinner tonight, and things started off fine - good service and decent drinks at the bar. Then, we were seated, only a few minutes past our reservation. The waiter came over fairly timely, but started off fairly surly. He wouldn't make a recommendation. Then as we perused the menu, he disappeared for nearly 15 minutes. When he finally came back we ordered the New York strip and the butternut squash salad. The salad came out fairly quickly, and was tasty. We then proceeded to wait for over 20 minutes for our steak. The steak, which was supposed to be 10.5 ounces, was no more than 8, had not been trimmed so the grill had curled all the fat, and the steak was clearly medium, not medium rare as we had ordered. It was not well seasoned. The brussels sprouts, which were supposed to be cooked with onion and bacon, had neither onion nor bacon, and only about half of them were cooked. The waiter came back and checked once or twice while we were eating, but was hardly warm and fuzzy, and made no effort to make things right for our long wait. (By the time we received our steak, we had been in the restaurant for over an hour.) All said, a disappointing date night..."}
{"text":"The food is not bad. Lunch menu is limited. A few things on the menu plus the buffet option with 8 different things to try. Buffet was smaller than I expected. Service was ordinary. I think I was one of the few people eating in the restaurant. Never had a desire to make a second visit after I had already given the lunch buffet a try before.   There are numerous places to go for a better lunch experience."}
{"text":"We ordered the cranberry pecan chicken salad sandwich.  It was lacking in flavor, very bland. We also ordered the pulled pork spring rolls, which were not pleasing to the palette -- southern BBQ does not mix well with Asian cuisine!  Two small spring rolls for $7.50 was definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"First time here and it was good.  Had the fried cat fish and fried oysters and both dishes were very good.  Prices were reasonable and service was excellent .  Taylor was smart enough to bring out a sample of a soup...bright indeed!"}
{"text":"Excellent meal - fresh and homemade. Planning to come back for chicken and waffles. Love that many ingredients are from local farms."}
{"text":"For brunch get the potatoes and grits for sure. I got the BLT eggs and it wasn't very good, no seasoning and not enough B, L and T. I could've made them better. And for a $9 plate I'm kinda leaving hungry. My fam liked the poached eggs with pork. But a nicely decorated atmosphere and friendly staff. Would come back for sure, just wouldn't get this plate again."}
{"text":"This is a very nice restaurant. Nice and big and not too crowded seating. The Queens Feast was an excellent deal. We got some delicious food for only $30. it didn't start out great.. our waitress came over with water and happened to have a glass of wine on her tray and spilled that on us right away... my only complaint is she should have comped us something for that aggravation."}
{"text":"Went to one of our FAV restaurants again last night..but I have a bone to pick with the CHEF. We had a party of 3.Our Bill ws over 100.00  My daughter is 9 months pregnant...due tomorrow...She ordered the New  South  Burger for her Entree - asking to hold the bacon because of Nitrates!!  We asked if there was any way she could have some Fried Pickles on the Burger. We were willing to pay extra for them....The Waitress was hesistant..but The CHEF SAID..ABSOLUTELY  NOT!  Explain This one....He has Fried Pickles back there...they have a Frickle Burger which is a Burger with Fried Pickles...but he would not..Not even for a Pregnant woman who offered to pay for the extra ingredient add the fried pickles....Did I say Pickles..and She is Pregnant...WTH?????"}
{"text":"As soon as I read the words Fried Okra Salad I was like \"Ok, I'm in\".  The interior isn't anything to write home about as far as I could tell.  I ate here at lunch time and the place wasn't that busy but it's not really situated in a location that I would think would have a large lunch crowd.  More of a dinner kind of place to stop.  The beer taps and bottles were solid as they offered some craft beers along with your typical domestic staples.  Back to the salad.  This is where I was a bit let down.  I mean I loved the Okra but the food just didn't have any personality.  I know I sound like a brat saying that but with a dish that unique I kind of expected it to be, well, unique.  It was basically a cobb salad - sans egg - with fried okra on top.  Meh."}
{"text":"Awesome food and top notch service. I had a couple small plates and a Manhattan and all of it was great. I can't wait to bring my wife here for dinner."}
{"text":"Popped in for a spontaneous lunch and was pretty impressed with the results. More specifically, with their burgers. I'm sure the rest of the menu is great, but I only checked out the blue cheese burger and pork sandwich. Both were perfect. We were disappointed we didn't have time to hit them up again on our way out of town.  Service was very friendly. I would love to come back to try more next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Try everything! It's all delicious and local! The service is excellent and the food is even better. We have recently discovered this spot and plan on becoming regulars here!"}
{"text":"This is a very good restaurant. It's close to my home so I eat here a lot. I wasn't sure whether to give it three or four stars so I settled on four.  Good burgers and good eggs. I'm not wild about this place but it's good food."}
{"text":"We have been to new south several times over the past several months. The food has always been great. We have had a myriad of menu options and each dish has never disappointed. The service has always been friendly. The only complaint is the ambiance. I really wish they would update their tables, chairs, floors, bathrooms etc..."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch for the first time and this place is a hard pass. The server opened with explaining that they were farm to table, everything was local and fresh. We ordered the grilled ham and cheese with fruit for our one year old son, which turned out to be Kraft/processed cheese with cubes of ham on pita bread, not grilled but looked and felt like it was microwaved to just melt the cheese. The fruit was large chunks of unripened pineapple, nothing else. I asked if they had any other fruit as the pineapple was hard to bite through. The server came back and told us the chef said they have limited berries so it would be a $1.50 upcharge. Paying extra for ripe fruit - hardly what you think of with farm to table (along with processed cheese product for that matter). I ordered the soft shell crab benedict special and my husband ordered the meatloaf. Both came out cold. My husband did like the flavor of his. Mine was very bland even with extra salt. I also asked for no tomato on my benedict but it came with two tomato slices. The server was nice but didn't notice or ask about me not eating my meal. Their biscuits were good so I'll give two stars but there are plenty of other decent to good places nearby...no need to try this place."}
{"text":"I was soooo excited about trying the southern food of new south!!! I ordered pork loin, which is what I love to order when I eat soul food......annnnd I was not cooked properly. When it has not been fully cooked it makes the meat tough and hard to eat. I was disappointed. I had such high expectations for this place. My husband ordered shrimp and grits which turned out nice. Tastes good......but we most likely will not return. I think that for upscale southern food....Mert's is still the reining champs. If you want a relaxed meal in a normal environment try LaWans on south tryon. They throw down in there!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times. I like that they  patronize local farms, vendors and breweries. The crab cakes,Shrimp &Grits , Fried Turkey and Dressing are good. Fried Green Tomatoes for an appetizer are really good, as is the pimento cheese. My only complaint would be that service is inconsistent. On a few occasions, we have  had servers who were not very attentive, even when the restaurant was not crowded.  You should not have to flag down servers and repeatedly ask for items. And a server should greet you and take drink orders within 5 minutes of being seated, IMHO."}
{"text":"We are regulars here! Their food is amazing! The staff has always been kind and friendly. Scott is one of our favorite servers and is always great dealing with us and our two little kids.  The biscuits and gravy are my personal favorite but really everything there is good. We often take company from out of town here for brunch and they all have fallen in love with this little place."}
{"text":"I was excited to finally try this place since it's so close to my house in the Arboretum in South Charlotte. My husband & I are ready to check out some new places & are using Restaurant Week as the perfect excuse to experiment.  We don't dine out all that often, so when we do & when we plan to drop more than $10 on a meal, I want to be impressed. I want to really enjoy my time & my food. Alas, that was not the case at New South Kitchen.  First of all, we were completely overdressed. I had scolded my husband for wanting to wear shorts to dinner, but now realize his preferred attire would have been much more appropriate for this surprisingly casual place. Most of the workers were wearing jeans & tshirts. And the other guests were equally casual.  Bread - It's not often I turn down carbs. But this bread had no flavor. A flavored butter might have helped, but there was nothing to save this pre-dinner snack. Fried green tomatoes & salad - both were decent. Generous portion of tomatoes with a sauce that had some zip. Deviled eggs - would not order these again. The ones with pickles were the best since it added flavor to an otherwise bland appetizer. I also prefer my deviled egg mixture to be smooth. They use ground mustard in theirs, which I didn't care for. Meatloaf - the hi-lite of the meal! I'd go back for this. Very moist. Very flavorful. Pork - this was my husband's entree. Tasted good but had more fat than he wants in lean protein. Grilled pound cake & chocolate mousse - both were ok but not worth the extra calories in my opinion. We preferred the chocolate option over the pound cake, which the server recommended & raved about.   Speaking of our server... ugh! Very loud. Too over-the-top. Used the same ridiculous lines with every table while taking orders, bringing the food, and collecting the check. Instead of trying to be Mister Funny, he should have been paying attention to our water glasses that were empty and we had to ask for refills twice. The manager doing the \"table visits\" barely approached our table, as he breezed by several tables at once asking us all if everything was ok. I didn't get the sense he was actually interested in a response, but rather just checking our table off his list for the hour.  Lastly, the thing that really was a bummer about our evening was the flies. Yes, flies! I expect that when I dine on a patio, but when I'm inside eating in a nicer restaurant, I don't want to have to keep shoo-ing bugs away from my food. If this is what we were experiencing in the dining room, it makes you wonder what the kitchen is like. Not good. Not good at all."}
{"text":"Ive heard rave reviews for 10 months from friends, today I thought Id see what the fuss was about! Appetizer Roasted Mushroom soup                    Pulled Pork Spring Rolls Entree: Crispy Grits               Deviled Eggs               Tuna Salad sandwich  We both enjoyed everything and will definitely be back- our server April was also very accommodating and professional. Its nice to know that you can have both quality plated food and exceptional service at the same place"}
{"text":"One of our favorite spots in the Mint Hill/ Matthews area. We have taken almost every friend and family member that has visited us to New South Kitchen and a bad meal is never had. Friendly staff, rotating menu items, and excellent products keeps us coming back on a regular basis. Priced affordably and definitely get what you pay for (and then sum)!  The chicken and waffles, chicken dumplings, and anytime they have duck on the menu are great!"}
{"text":"So I'm hanging out with my good friend, and he says to me 'Last night me and Suzanne went up to New South and had a half off bottle of wine and fried blueberry pie.\"   \"Excuse me, what's that now? You had what now? You said fried something...\"  \"Blueberry pie...\"  And so began my desire to dine at New South. Now I know what you're thinking: \"Oh I can't wait to hear what he says about the blueberry pie!\". Well stranger, I disappoint, because when I got there, the dessert offering had items on it even BETTER than aforementioned fried blueberry pie. I should have written down what they were called. I can only describe what I had as \"Banana wizardry\". It was a decadent, light, fluffy, syrupy banana (and rum?) cake with ice cream, reminiscent of bananas foster. Divine without being overly sweet.   We also had a full meal before that, of which I requested a surprise vegetarian meal since they weren't heavy on the vegetarian selections. Now, my theory on asking for a surprise is that it should instill in the chef a sense of adventure and a break in their routine. This was the result here. I received a wonderful mixture of items that were sides on the menu along with new creations. Each were distinct in their flavors and pleasing to the palette. Everyone's meal was great, including a big juicy burger and a salmon dish with big fluffy corn cakes.  Our waitress was extremely friendly, funny, and helpful. I'm the type to harass waitresses playfully, and she handled my idiocracy with grace and humor. The manager also made appearances at our and other tables to check on things, which I appreciate.  Bravo to this fine place."}
{"text":"Dinner Sep 17   Don't be swayed by the fact that this place is in a strip center.  This is a quality farm to table type restaurant.  Fresh ingredients, home made recipes, and truly fine food.   The entrees were fantastic - Of the three I tasted the Pork Loin was simply to die for!   But honestly, I could of made a meal just of of the appetizers!   Smoked Trout Spread was best fish spread I have ever had!   Crispy Pork Belly was good, but man oh man - the accompanying garnishment which consisted of \"warm butternut squash & pecan salad, orange glaze\" made this appetizer on of the most flavorful dishes I have had in years! truly a \"wow\" dish!   The Pimento Cheese spread was 100% homemade but, to my taste, the pimentos were a  bit more spicy than I like.   I will 100% go back again as this is my new favorite local restaurant in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"First of all let me say... Our server Kelsey (whose twin sister also works there) was utterly amazing! You need to ask for her when you visit. Not only will she assist you in every way she can, she also is very informative and knowledgeable about the restaurant and menu. Kudos Kelsey! Now the food..OMG! So since it is Charlotte Restaurant Week 2015, I chose New South because it's menu was more conducive with my company's pallette..lol. The pork spring rolls were perfect and non greasy. They filled with smoky flavor and very juicy. The dipping sauce was sweet with a sneaky spice kick. There was a pickled red onion slaw that added the needed sour acidity. I had the fried green tomatoes. Since they pretty much taste the same anywhere, I did like the horseradish sauce that accompanied them. They were sliced perfectly so that you don't look like a salvage slurping the juices while chewing. Course 2 Exquisite Rainbow Trout seared to perfection and crispiness. It was paired with collard greens and a roasted pepper medley. My plate... the SUPER moistened meatloaf made with grass fed beef. Oh yeah, did I mention ALL OF THEIR INGREDIENTS COME FROM LOCAL FARMS?! OH YEAHHHHH! It's  like even if you wanted to cheat and wanted something fattening that you shouldn't.. it's still healthy and pretty much organic.. so no guilt! By the time dessert came, I was fat, full, and almost completely lazy! There was pound cake served with  homemade vanilla espresso ice cream and marinated peaches.. again OMG! Powdered Beignets...somebody loves me! Kelsey mentioned one more detail that just sent me over the edge.. COMPLIMENTARY  chocolate truffles! Look I know how this review must read however you HAVE to go and EXPERIENCE New South Kitchen. New South is the new twist in Southern Fare!"}
{"text":"I found new south kitchen on restaurant week. I was very excited heard some good things so 4 of went. Their appetizer started with pimento cheese spread with pita bread an pork spring roll an crispy potato salad an fried green tomatoes. I loved the fried green tomatoes an pork roll were delish. The pimento cheese had red peppers too hot for me. The crispy potato salad was pieces of potato n corn an not sure what else an a poached egg on top.  That was not a hit at our table. For entrees we ordered the pork belly with collards an fried chicken with smashed potatoes an string beans an the shrimp and grits with gravy. The pork belly my friend said was perfectly cooked moist an great flavor the collards were not as good. The shrimp and grits were perfect shrimp cooked just right n grits very smooth and creamy perfect dish. The fried chicken breast was disappointing , first I smelled something an realize as I'm eating my chicken they Burnt the breading on the chicken. It was 2 chicken Brest a lot of foodi should have sent it back but I was hungry so I took the breading off. My friend said they could see it was burnt that should have never come out of the kitchen . My mashed potatoes were good but very little gravy I didn't wanna ask for more since I was already charged .50 for an extra biscuit .  If I'm at showmars or McDonalds n I want another sauce it's .25 fine I expect that but not at a very nice restaurant . Your cost should be in each entree already. So for desert we had the grilled buttermilk pound cake with vanilla ice cream an black berries . It was okay I was thinking they would just have a few grilled marks on the cake which would make it warm n add the ice cream to melt that would have been so good. No they had a sugary taste so I assume they put either sugar water or sprinkled sugar than grilled it maybe but it was too sugary for pound cake. My dad makes homemade pound cakes they are to die for . We also tried the pecan bread pudding now that was good moist not over cooked an more pecans would have been nice. I wish I could give them a 5 but a 3 is the best I can do. I would only wanna go back for some appetizers :)"}
{"text":"We love this place.  The service is fantastic and I love what it stands for.  Sustainable, ethical, farm fresh foods. The food is delicious and so are the drinks.  This is definitely a staple of ours, and the price is very fair for what you get!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We decided to stop in here on a recent Friday night after doing some shopping it was around 8:15pm and most of the other places in the Arboretum had quite long lines.  We walked right in to no lines and a half empty bar area.  We were greeted almost immediately and were told it would be a few minutes.  It was a little weird as the host walked away and kind of left us just standing there for about 10 minutes.  When we looked around about 25-30% of the tables were empty so we weren't sure why we were waiting but, I digress.  We decided to get 3 small plates and split an entree.  We got the fried oysters, Pimento Cheese, and fried green tomatoes for our small plates and then the catfish entree, to spilt.  The server asked if we'd like the food to come out in any particular order and we said no.  I thought is was really awesome of her to ask that.  Her service was excellent, seriously, it was excellent.  She asked all the right questions, checked in on us at the right time, just fantastic.  Anyway, our 3 small plates came out.  The best thing of the 3 was the pimento cheese as it was the only thing with any flavor.  The fried green tomatoes were very bland, i had to smother them in the sauce it came with.  Would not get those again. Fried Oysters again, were bland.  i guess it's maybe a lot to ask to get flavorful shellfish this far inland.  We smeared the pimento cheese on the tomatoes and oysters just to give it some flavor.  we finished the small plates and then the cat fish was brought out.  The cat fish was good, but again, very bland. It came with a sauce that you had to smother the fish in to get any kind of flavor.  The grit cakes were just ok and my boyfriend commented that the Brussels sprouts weren't as good as the one's I make at home.    Long story short, while the service of the waitstaff was excellent, the host/hostess needs to manage things better and the for the price the food just isn't worth it.  75% of our food was flavorless and bland, though it came quickly and was piping hot.  I don't think we will be returning unless the food improves."}
{"text":"I just want to start off by saying this place is amazing!!!! We stopped here by chance because our normal brunch place had a long wait time and we saw New South has $3 mimosa! Winner!!  I had the chicken and waffles with a side of mac and cheese. The chicken was tender and juicy and full of flavor! The waffle was the best waffle I've had in a long time! It was so delicious paired with the syrup and homemade butter. The Mac and cheese didn't disappoint either! I was very pleased with my plate.  I also nibbled on everyone else's plate. My friend ordered a bacon, cheese & onion omelette. It was a nice portion and very flavorful and cheesy. That also came with potato wedges seasoned with sea salt -which were very tasty! My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken that came with his choice of 2 sides; mashed potatoes and collard greens. I tasted both and of course it was delicious!!   Overall I would definitely recommend this restaurant, the prices aren't bad, the food is fresh (& did I mention LOCAL?!!). I will definitely be coming back to try dinner. Brunch was a hit!!"}
{"text":"I love to eat at locally owned restaurants rather than chains.  New South Kitchen is among the best of these.  It is just the right size.  Big enough to be a successful business yet small enough to make for friendly personal service.    All of the food is locally sourced and selected daily by the chef.  He changes the menu often to reflect the best of what is available.  Whatever you order will be prepared carefully and presented artfully.   The staff is very friendly and professional.  They know the food and can help you order just the right meal.  Just the right blend of being attentive and being out of the way.  New South Kitchen is our favorite place to take out of town guests.  We know they don't have anything like it \"back home\".  We also can count on treating them to a great meal and a great dining experience."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The people are great and the menu always has amazing options (some healthy and some \"splurge\" items). They support local farmers so lots of fresh, seasonal items. The salads are made from local lettuce- which always makes a HUGE  difference. House made dressings. Also, The desserts are made in house and can't be beaten. Homemade ice cream. Pound cake is delish!  Good selection of drinks and wines. I have a weakness for their fried okra, pulled pork sandwich and the fried green tomatoes. YUMM!!!"}
{"text":"So what attracted me was the farm to table dining... Love Everything about that!  The food was just okay. Lots of salt and pepper needed to season everything. I ordered the deviled eggs. They give you (2) of 3 different kinds. All very bland... Disappointing.  I had the shrimp and grits with a side of collard greens. Great portion... But again, lacking flavor. I needed salt and pepper.   The best thing about this place is their service and the biscuits. The biscuits are to die for. Never had one like it."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now and each time the food and drinks have been consistently good. Staff are incredibly friendly as well. I like the comfortable seating and decor, both inside and out. At this point I've sampled over half the menu and everything was really good...I think you could order just about anything here and do well for yourself.   Additionally, prices are reasonable and portion sizes are good. There are some ways in which they could potentially liven up their menu, make it a bit more exciting, but there's something to be said in New South's reliability in terms of taste and freshness.   Of note, I have never had a salad w/ croutons keep so well (as leftovers) until I took home New South's roasted romaine salad in a doggy bag. I saved this salad (w/ it's house made croutons) for lunch the next day fully expecting to end up throwing a soggy mess into our chicken coop as a midday treat for our chooks. Instead I was met with a salad that was just as good as it had been the night before...croutons and romaine were still totally fresh and crunchy/crispy! I'm not sure how this particular salad accomplished what I'd previously assumed to be impossible...I've attempted this same feat for about 25 years now with no luck. To me, this little leftovers coup is a testament to freshness of the ingredients that this restaurant uses!"}
{"text":"The service was great.  Very friendly clean cute place.  The food was a bit disappointing. The chicken and waffles were good, however i was expecting actual chicken not little strips.  So that was a lil sad because the flavor of the chicken was good.  My husband got a burger and that was not good at all."}
{"text":"It was ok...the pan fried chicken needed more  seasoning..the fried green tomatoes were cut too thick and needed more seasoning..the cake was awesome!! I also liked the white wine."}
{"text":"ORIGINAL POST (ALSO SEE UPDATE BELOW)  New South is a go-to dinner place for us, for a reasonably priced, solid meal.  However, tonight was disappointing on a number of points:  We were seated at a booth that had a large patch of red duct tape over a hole in the seat (I hope this is very recent and temporary??).  We then sat about 5 minutes before anyone noticed us at a table, and then it was someone other than our eventual waitress.  The waiter who did greet us took our drink orders and promptly served us, followed soon by our waitress, who from then on did fine attending our table.  I ordered the mixed greens salad and forgot to ask for dressing on the side (my fault), and yes, it had too much dressing on it, but also just a disappointing salad for $6 -- greens and not much else, and the greens not all that fresh.  I ordered the flank steak, which I've had before and loved, but tonight I could only eat about 1/2 of it because of how chewy most of the meat was (some I just had to stop chewing and spit out; other parts I could get through by cutting really small bites and chewing a lot).  The dish was also overly sauced with a very salty brine that seemed to be mostly just W sauce.  The potatoes were pretty tasteless and watery (with some soft chunks in there too).  Green beans were crisp-cooked and good.  On the plus side, my husband ordered the pork, which he said was tasty and tender.  Also, you can't beat $4 for a generous pour of a very decent house cabernet.  Add to that their participation in Citipass and other discounts, and I am willing to overlook an occasional disappointing meal since the price is right, but tonight, yes, I was very disappointed in one of my favorite non-fancy restaurants.  UPDATE:  After posting this review above, the owner contacted me and offered to comp my meal.  I suggested I just visit again and give them another try, which we did tonight (11/11/11).  Everything was superb!  Got seated quickly, table visited & serviced promptly.  I had the red fish entree, and my husband had the pork shoulder.  Both were perfect, and the sides were great.  Loved the fresh greens \"slaw\" on the fish, and the braised squash.  Cooking time was still just a tad longer than some places, but the dining room and bar were both packed (Carrier Classic on the big screens), so I imagine there was just a temporary backlog as we were there at peak time.  I appreciate that New South offers deals in Citipass, etc.  Their menu is already affordable, so that makes it an even better deal.  I spoke to the chef/owner and his wife; both were gracious and interested in our impressions, and they comped our meal tonight.  It doesn't get much classier than that.  Thanks, New South.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I want to start off saying I referred a few friends to New South all have thoroughly enjoyed apart from one neutral comment from one. Which the couple that had went there for lunch, said the buffet was limited and that it was not over the top like she had anticipated. Maybe sounds like they need to change out menus for lunch and brunch.  I have only ever went there for dinner. It has always been awesome. We have tried most of the items on the menu. Starting on the kid's menu, the mac & cheese is awesome. It is completely homemade and delicious. The appetizers from Fried Green Tomatoes, Cheese plate and Redneck Cheese board our all wonderful. The grilled romaine salad is another favorite. We have the rotisserie chicken, the pork, and typically get the veggie plate that is served with only what' s best in season and the freshest. There desserts are tasty too and they have half priced wine tues for an extra bonus. Check this place out as I can only promise you that your dinner will be a delight, cute little classy southern joint. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Authentic. Great atmosphere and service. Emily recommended the trout. She was right. Had a wonderful anniversary. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"WOW! Very nice. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Large group handled well. Food was excellent as well. I had the \"Fickle Burger\" and my wife had the roasted Chicken.... her chicken fell off the bone. She LOVED it. My burger was prepared just how I ordered it and was very good -- and unique (included Fried Pickles on the burger). Wine was 1/2 price to boot. Add this place to your must dine while in Charlotte especially with a large crowd. Food is all local grass feed and hormone free. Several in our group were stating this is there new favorite place in town."}
{"text":"Dinner at 5:30 on November 16, 2015 Great food. Pork and chicken cooked to perfection!  Sweet potato side not cooked and very hard so could not eat the larger pieces. Greens, creamed potatoes and green beans cooked to perfection. Mike was our waiter and was slower than molasses! Be sure you do not have him if you are in a hurry. Will return!!"}
{"text":"Unplanned dinner stop on a Friday night around 7:30. Actually got seated right away. Server was very friendly, personable and knowledgeable. The food is locally sourced - all NC or SC (fish primarily). We had 3 small plates: flat bread, pork belly and a fried green tomato. 2 glasses of wine were reasonably priced. Small plates were $10 and very filling.  The crispy pork was fabulous! 3 pieces with sweet potato and pecans with orange glaze. We almost arm wrestled got the last piece.  The fried green tomato was firm and properly done. Nice ranch sauce.  The flatbread was good not great.   Overall a very nice experience with excellent food. Will come again with reservations"}
{"text":"This place is a little gem! I am so glad that there are good places to eat in the Arboretum. I went here recently with a group and everything was delicious! I had the N.C. Shrimp and grits. It was very filling and delicious, although it still can't compete with Charleston's. Very good food and excellent service!"}
{"text":"Food is four stars, but service was one star. This restaurant was highly recommended to us, so it was quite disappointing when the service from the beginning to the end was terrible. Our waiter seemed to love his other tables around us, but was lackluster to us, possibly because we were college students and therefore he thought we were broke?! We were treated with utter disrespect and were basically ignored all night-drinks were never refilled, dishes were never cleared from the beginning, and it took at least 30 minutes after we were done eating to get our check. Thankfully a kind young waitress finally cleared our plates and gave us the bill, probably seeing that we had been waiting for so long. Never judge a book by its cover!!"}
{"text":"When it comes to southern cooking with an modern culinary flair, this place is awesome. I had shrimp and grits, my wife had their fried catfish, and we shared their fried green tomatoes appetizer. It was simply delicious.   The service was wonderful. That atmosphere was elegant and nice. Definitely a place for a nice romantic dinner or brunch after church.   I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner....tried the pimento sausage won tons -excellent, followed by porkloin with andouille gravy and red pepper marmalade with a side a mashed potatoes and a fresh baked biscuits- HEAVEN! Attentive service and a nice cocktail menu too.  Wish I had room for the grilled pound cake with blueberries....next time for sure!"}
{"text":"Customer service is horrible if you go between lunch and dinner when they are not as busy. Our waiter it seems was a manager and it took him FOREVER to take our order...we actually had to finally get up and ask for someone to come take our order. Then when we were ready to leave it took FOREVER for the waiter to come and pick up our payment. We finally went to the host and said we wanted to pay only to be told to go back to our table and our waiter will come to us. Excuse me Mr. but I was in a rush and I don't feel like waiting FOREVER again. Smh ridiculous. Oh yeah and food was \"ok\"."}
{"text":"My first time coming here was for restaurant week.   And I'm so glad that we came.  My husband and I ordered the pull pork rolls and the fried green tomatoes.   The fried green tomatoes was just ok. But I loved the pull pork rolls.  Very good.   My husband ordered the pork chop medallions and I ordered the pan fried chicken.  Both dishes was delicious.    For dessert, my husband got the pecan pie bread budding and I got the shortcake.   I was very pleased with this place.  This restaurant is now on my favorite list.   Good job New South.  :)"}
{"text":"Went with 3 friends, happily surprised with half price bottles of wine on Tuesday! Waiter was friendly. They were out of shrimp, and I was really wanting the shrimp and grits but got the Carolina burger instead. It was yummy and thick! Our table split the fries green tomatoes, they were delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Huge fan of New South! I stumbled across this by accident for lunch and it was so great we've been back every weekend since. Not only is the food delicious it is also all local which is very important to me. Of course this means it's a little pricier but trust me, it's well worth it.   The wait staff has always been pleasant! The bartenders are super knowledgeable about the menu and make a delicious cucumber cooler. Try out New South - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best shrimp and grits I've ever had. All of the food is really great, fast and courteous service make this place one of the best in town."}
{"text":"Since moving to Charlotte in October of 2008, this has quickly become one of our favorite restaurants.  We have dined at New South no less than 20 times in the past six months and have never been disappointed.    Tucked away in the Arboretum, it has a rather cozy feeling for a place with a more \"modern\" design.  Our server (Jim) is very knowledgeable about the menu and is able to answer every question we have.  New South has a really cool mix of \"comfort\" foods.  I think we have tried at least half of the menu including a lot of their nightly specials.  The deep fried turkey (Sunday) is a favorite - I also like their meatloaf, the chuck roast, flank steak, and my favorite (which is the Monday night special) Fried Chicken.  The Grilled romaine salad and artisan cheese trays are great starters and the apple Charlotte is their best dessert.  I highly recommend New South for dinner.  They have different diner specials and drink specials every night so you may want to call or visit their website before you go.  I know that Tuesday is 1/2 bottle wine, Sunday is 1/2 wine by the glass."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is perfectly seasoned, tender, juicy & possibly the best I have had!  Will definitely be back to try one of the daily chefs specials."}
{"text":"I've tried to think of a better way to put it, but in short New South.. confused me. Looking at the menu online prepped me for one type of restaurant (maybe something along the lines of Bask), upon entering to the bar area and the array of printed booth cushions and four tops I immediately got a more family feel... not a bad thing, the casual setting was comfortable and welcoming. Then, our server arrived wearing jeans and a tshirt with chuck taylors (okay this is a little more casual than I expected) and then we received our water in beer-labeled pint glasses. I understand the concept of bringing an upscale and contemporary cuisine to the masses, I just think there is a way to do it without making me feel like I'm in three restaurants at once.   But, onto the food. Our server was pretty quick to let us know the pulled pork spring rolls were about to be 86'd, so if we wanted them we should jump on that. They had sounded good, so we grabbed an order. We then ordered the swordfish and the shrimp and grits. The rolls arrived, and I couldn't accept the contrast in consistencies. It was a perfect fried shell, but the inside was such a mushy pulled pork filling it was an odd mouth feel. The sauce was nice, kind of a thinned out and spiced up sweet thai chili sauce.   The swordfish was extremely pungent. I hadn't ordered swordfish in a while but I felt like the pieces could have coated the corner of the room in fishiness. Smell aside, it tasted great, and the ham vinaigrette was a nice touch. Really the whole dish was great as long as you avoided the cucumber slaw. The shrimp and grits had great components, but together didn't hold much in the flavor department.  Overall attentive service, water glasses always filled, and the food had some good flavors. Also, really nice portion size on the big plates. I think when they release a new menu I'll try them again, but they aren't currently on my charlotte top restaurants list. And they are located along the curve of the strip with Le Peep, not towards the Taco Bell/Walmart area."}
{"text":"We have been here several times. The food has been consistently good. I like the farm to table concept, although the prices are still a little high even when this is taken into account. My kids like the waffle and order it every time. The biscuits are delicious! The burgers are tasty. The shrimp and grits are good, but I wish the portions were larger. I was still hungry after eating it the last time and ended up eating everyone else's leftovers. The half roasted chicken is very flavorful.   The service has been hit or miss. We had one dining experience where the waiter ignored us the whole meal. We had taken guests from NY for dinner and it was embarrassing. We had to chase him down for the check and it took over 30 mins. We wanted dessert, but decided to cut our losses and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"We decided to come here for Easter Sunday, basically it was one of the only places I could reserve. I was dining with my mother and grandmother and we were immediately seated. The place has a nice decor, colored chalk boards list the local farmers they use and also the local brews they offer. We came at 11:15 so this was brunch. We started with the fried green tomatoes, not my number one favorite but a top contender. My mother got the penne pasta with chicken, grandmother got the salmon with grit cakes and I got the lemon chicken sandwich and got the braised greens in the side.  Since we were served brunch we were also offered a biscuit or a sugar muffin- sugar muffin please!!! All 3 of us were happy with what we choose. Moms pastas had some good flavors but to me you can order that anywhere, nanas salmon had all kinda stuff going on, the grit cakes, Brussels sprouts, and the salmon on top, all were cooked GREAT! She also got a side of Mac n cheese which was totally not worth the extra $5 they charged her. My lemon chicken sandwich had goat cheese and a tomato compote with a nice herbal mayonnaise, I took the bread off for carb purposes and was happy with the way it tasted! The sugar muffin ended up being a happy surprise and dessert!"}
{"text":"Best food in South Charlotte. Truly!  Local farm-to-table, local brew...amazing food EVERY SINGLE TIME."}
{"text":"I've got a lot of business meetings each week. What I love about this place- tables are not crowded into each other. There's enough  room for my plate to fit on the table- and also all my notebooks and meeting essentials. The staff has always greeted us, offered us info on the daily specials. Their beef is grass fed, and the burgers are amazing (they accommodate  me with bread free dishes- and never seem surprised or dismayed when I ask). Their side dishes are great portions and scrumptious!! Loved their roasted Brussels sprouts. They also are conscious of our meeting discussion, and have perfected when to ask us a question \"how is your food today\"? Or \"would you like more water\"? in a way that is not disruptive to our conversations. This is a great atmosphere, a little slow to receive food- but perfect for a business lunch or to catch up with an old friend."}
{"text":"Consistency! This is one of our favorite spots in Charlotte, the food is always excellent and the service is on the same level. Very happy they brought pork belly back to the menu."}
{"text":"Everything is to love at The South Kitchen! We have become regulars. It's nice to feel welcomed and leave full."}
{"text":"Finally ate here for queens feast and wasn't disappointed! The wait for a table was 2 hours but we happily ate at the bar and were served super fast! Great staff and amazing food. The pork belly was so creamy and the shrimp and grits were up to a Charlestown girl's exacting standards. A great date spot!"}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place when we were down far south on Providence Road.  The look and feel of this place felt like something I would see on Restaurant Impossible after the makeover....not sure why...  For an appetizer, we ordered the Pecan Crusted Goat cheese...wow...this restaurant is not f'n around when they call these items 'Small Plates'.  The goat cheese was good, but about the size of a super ball you get in a vending machine....  Next...the bread and butter came out...I love bread and butter...this I did not love.  It wasn't 'just ok', or a non-factor....it was horrible..if that is even possible for bread.  Usually you can just salvage the crust, or just drench it with butter, but not this time.  It was kind of like eating compressed dust...  For dinner, we got the KT's Penne, which was very delicious.  The sauce was unique and fresh tasting with some good bacon mixed throughout.  They should bottle it up....why not?  Overall, the service was great and the food (except the bread...wow) was good."}
{"text":"New South catered an event in our home for our organization Crohn's and Colitis foundation. Couldn't recommend more! The food was beautifully presented and tasted great. The staff came in and set it up with a full bar effortlessly. And they were a pleasure to have in our home and work with.  And the clean up was as seamless as the set up. THANK YOU and we thoroughly enjoyed our evening."}
{"text":"We went here because they have a prix fixe for $25.  It includes an entree, an appetizer, a glass of house wine, and dessert.  Not bad. The menu itself was pretty awesome.  Went with a total of 5 people, two of the guys didn't even go prix fixe.  And the bill was still respectable.  We went on a Tuesday I think, and it was 1/2 price wine bottles as well. We decided to go family style on the apps.  Fried green tomatoes, a meatball flatbread, a tuna spread, \"redneck\" cheese board (pimento haha), and mussels.  They were all delicious.  If I had to rank them, hmm I'd have to say flatbread, tuna, tomatoes, mussels, cheese. For entrees, one guy got the pork tenderloin.  2 of us got the baked chicken off the prix fixe, and the other 2 got the roast chicken from the regular menu.  The house wine was not bad, a bit sweet for cabernet, and the shiraz we got was peppery.   Then we got dessert, we also kinda split up between bananas/rumcake, butterscotch bread pudding, chocolate mousse, and a lemon tart.  Damn, it was a nice surprise and pretty good.  We'll definitely be back.  Oh yeah, the decor is kinda cool, like almost homey, but still modern enough to have a few flat screens at the bar.  I would describe this place as kind of a classy southern place, but not over the top."}
{"text":"More like a 3 1/2 rating but Yelp doesn't allow half stars. Our waiter was personable and attentive.    For appetizer had fried green tomatoes, so good! For main course had shrimp and grits which were phenomenal, and did not lack salt at all as mentioned by another yelper. Also had the special, braised short ribs on a bed of grits..so moist it melted in your mouth! Kids menu had fried turkey with mashed potatoes and green beans, meat was moist and green beans crispy.  For drinks had the Moscow mule, which was served in a  mason jar not a copper mug no mint on side. It was disappointing, would not order again. The kids lemonade was delicious, not Minute Maid crap. The iced tea was ok, but nothing to write home about.  Overall we would visit again if in the area, food was very good and fresh."}
{"text":"I was in town for a quick business trip and had dinner with great friends. I wanted Southern cuisine.  Every bite was amazing! The fried green tomatoes were perfection! The red snapper divine and the sweet potatoes just the way I like it! The fried blueberry pie was the best way to end a delicious meal. It was so good I forgot to photograph.  Great service and great food! I will return my next visit to Charlotte."}
{"text":"I like the concept of this restaurant. The food is locally sourced and fresh. The dishes are traditional southern, but prepared in a modern gourmet way. The shrimp and grits are outstanding. The seasoning and sauces were flavorful without being overwhelming. Highly recommended."}
