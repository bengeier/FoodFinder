{"text":"First of all, I'd like to say that the owners are wonderful people and it seems that everything they serve is handmade and from the heart! I ordered the chicken nachos as an appetizer. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the jalapeños were amazing! My entrée was the carne asada, which I have heard of but when I was brought a plate with a thin steak on it I was a little confused. Oscar (the owner) came over to the table and explained the best ways to eat it, and it was absolutely delicious! The pinto beans were whole and once again were absolutely cooked to perfection. He brought out 3 different salsas for us as well. One was the house salsa, which was the perfect blend of spice and sweet. The other was a much hotter salsa that definitely creeps up on you! It takes about 4 seconds before it tears you up! The third was a tomatillo salsa that was green. I'm not sure how to explain it but it was very good. For dessert I had the fried ice cream and it was awesome! The service was spectacular, as we were promptly seated and the food came very quickly! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for great handmade Mexican food! Kudos to Cafe Posada!"}
{"text":"Cafe Posada is one of Gilbert's best kept little secrets.  Its a great little restaurant you've probably driven by many times on the corner of Gilbert and Ray rd.   You've got to try the Carne Asada or the Pollo a la Parilla.  The never compromise on the fresh ingredients and you won't be disappointed.  Pleasantly Surprised!"}
{"text":"I am fan. We finally went here after many years of just driving by. It is not very impressive by the look of it, but the food is really good. Order the Posada items, they are really yummy. The service is good. the salsa is really good. We will go back again. The price is right."}
{"text":"Be forewarned, this is quite possibly the worst mexican food spot I have ever eaten at! If you enjoy authentic mexican food, don't go here!

The only reason why I'm giving their rating 2 stars versus only 1 star was because our waitress was very polite and serviced us well. The food however was terrible! 

My husband ordered the two cheese enchilada plate, and the enchilada sauce tasted nothing like enchilada sauce! The rice looked like orange pasty mush and the beans tasted like canned beans. I ordered the chicken taco salad and this is the first time I've had cold chicken in my taco salad. I couldn't eat it! The only thing good was the appetizer sampler that we ordered. 

We were the only people there on a Friday afternoon and now I know why! Overall we overpaid for crappy food!"}
{"text":"I had driven by Cafe Posada a million times and finally decided to stop in after we tried to hit Joe's Farm Grill for the Friday Fish Fry (they had run out).  The sign outside said \"Under Old Management\" which indicated to me that this was a good time to try it. It must be good!

Alas.

This is Mexican food like your white momma used to make. Think black olives from a can served on top of sour cream, shredded cheese, and some sort of variation of meat/beans. 

And we actually had to ask if they served alcohol because there wasn't an alcohol menu and the waitress didn't offer."}
{"text":"Meh...

I've been here a few times. That said...

When was this place built? I'm pretty sure the furniture is original... Check out the bar. What? I remember when TV's looked like that! 

The food os OK. Tiny little menu with only a few things to choose from. It is decorated like a Mexican restaurant. Maybe I missed something here but my opinion is that this place is like stepping into a time machine and being transported to outdated."}
{"text":"I want to give this place 2.5 stars until I can try something different. Went to lunch there on a weekday. Apparently we were the first one there. I guess whoever orders first for the day gets the call on the special of the day. So for those of you that went Wednesday, sorry it's taco. Looking at the prices on the menu, this place is definitely overpriced for your standard Mexican fare. The average food (not ala carte) is about $10-12. Taco was a hardshell taco. I asked for shredded beef. Taco shell is not home made. Your standard taco bell taco shell. I really really despise that. I want fresh deep fried authentic taco shells! Otherwise I can go and buy some Ortega taco kits! The shredded beef however was moist, flavorful and good. It wasn't totally dried up and flavorless as someone claimed. So basically the taco shell sucked, otherwise it was alright."}
{"text":"I so wanted to like this place because it is so close to our house. Probably the worst Mexican food I have ever had. Nothing we ate had any flavor or tasted fresh at all. Beans tasted like they came out of a can. Shredded beef was bland and tasteless. While we were there I heard another table complain to the manager about the food. To my amazement he recommended another restaurant down the street for them to go to where they might like the food better. It's as if they have just given up. Oh and the prices are ridiculously high. Avoid Avoid Avoid."}
{"text":"First time eating there, stopped in for lunch. SO glad I did. The salsa is fantastic with a fire roasted flavor and the chicken enchilads are made with home cooked, hand pulled chicken. You can sure tell this stuff hasn't been frozen or come from a can, you can taste the 'homemade' in it. The rice & beans were great and the red sauce one of the most tastiest I've ver had!  Can't wait to go back for dinner with a margarita!"}
{"text":"Now here's Gilbert's best kept secret. I have driven by this building for years. It looks like a ran down building that you think is closed. But, tonight my wife and I decided we would give it a try. 

We were very surprised when we walked in. It's bright, clean, and edges on pretty. It was 180 degrees from the \"run down building\" we were expecting. The hostess, who was well dressed (I thought I was under dressed for a few minutes!) gave us a friendly greeting and thanked us for coming in. All the staff was just as friendly. 

The salsa was very yummy. 

The Guac, though was good, seemed a little over priced - I probably would stick with the yummy salsa next time. 

My wife had a simple combo with an enchilada and a taco. Very yummy. I had the Ultimate Burrito; it was okay in that it had an okay taste. The ingredients looked great (Chicken, grilled onions, carrot slices, green sauce), but, it didn't necessarily wow me (don't get me wrong - it was still tasty). All the food was well presented, hot (temp wise) and had a good taste. My recommendation - go for one of there more unique dishes. I think we would have been very wow'ed if we had done that. But, we were tired from a long work day and didn't have our brain's completely in gear. 

All in all; we are sure glad we finally stopped. We will be back."}
{"text":"I have a rule about Mexican restaurants.  The first time I visit, I always order their tacos.  If the tacos are good, I can usually count on being able to find other items on the menu I'll also like.

A couple of weekends ago, we arrived at Cafe Posada just after 11am on a Sunday morning.  The interior of the restaurant was nice and much more spacious than it looks from the outside.  Since it was still early, we were the second table seated for the day.  The servers were friendly and attentive.

I ordered shredded beef tacos.  After a few minutes, our plates came out to the table.  The plates were hot and the rice and beans were pretty tasty.  However, the tacos didn't cut it.  It seemed like the shredded beef was leftover from the day before and as if all the flavor had been cooked out of it.

So my dilemma is, the atmosphere and service were good but the food was really bland.  I'm still deciding if I'll give Cafe Posada another shot. Maybe I'll head back on a Friday evening."}
{"text":"Cafe Posada is what good, home-grown Mexican food should taste like. The restaurant  nothing fancy, but is bright and clean. Try the 
mesquite salsa, the chile rellanos and the Pollo la Parillo. And don't forget the tortilla soup -- tasty and satisfying enough to make a meal of it!

There is also a lounge area with a pool table."}
{"text":"MEH... this used to be my favorite place years ago, took wife today, her black beans were cold and crunchy, I asked to see manager, he came over and immediately said \"yeah, that's happened before, we keep them on salad bar and if anyone orders them, we just microwave some....\"  then he walked off with the dish and never returned..no apology...no meal comp..nothing.... \"HOT\" salsa wasn't hot at all.  Prices were higher than other mom and pop places.  I like the interior, its clean and neat despite being \"out of date\" 
on the good side: Clean, good service"}
{"text":"Their salsa gets an A+. Not really spicy, but high on taste. The fish tacos are solid and the Posada dishes are tasty. They have plenty of Negra Modelo on tap. My only gripe is with their hours. They close at 9PM on week nights - that might play well in Boise, but we need a little more time eat out here."}
{"text":"Wow, what a find! Great salsa, darn good house margarita, and the Pollo Pasado was wonderful! Great place for lunch as the service was prompt and the food came out super fast! The owner Oscar came to our table and shared various salsa's with us you can tell his restaurant is his passion. I was impressed by the quality of the food. After reading other reviews I was expecting something a little more bland and less thrilling, but honestly the flavors and quality was great. My new favorite find in Gilbert. Don't hesitate to give it a try!"}
{"text":"I can't believe that anyone could ever write a bad review of this restaurant.  We live in the neighborhood and this is a treasure (unfortunately a hidden treasure).  The owner is Oscar and he and the staff are always accomodating.  Their SALSA is the very best made anywhere.  Keep in mind sometimes it is hotter than other times depending on how much rain the Hatch chili's have gotten in New Mexico.  There is no way to describe how good it is.  Try it and you will agree with me, I am sure.  We always order the same meal.  My husband and self split the meat fajitas and always take some home.  Very good value for the money.  Surprised someone had to ask for a drink as 1/2 of the restaurant is a bar.  It is tastefully separate.  Please support this restaurant as they deserve to be in business.  (Closed Mondays).  On the s/e corner of Ray Road and Gilbert Road.  You will be glad you tried it!!"}
{"text":"I too have driven by millions of times..Seems like everytime that I choose to go, it is Monday and they are closed.  Which is okay, so is my business.
Finally, today I went..Service was impeccable liked the decor..It looked and felt like a Mexican restaurant..
It was either the owner or manager who seated me, and was very accommodating and explained, after asking, if they had good margaritas,   He went the extra mile and explained how \"HE\" made them...I must say, one of the best Marg's I've had in the valley.  Delicious..
My server came and was very very attentive and full of information.  Salsa was flavorful, but nothing to write home about.
Like the gentleman below me, I too always order the tacos on my first bout of a spot.  Instead of rice (which I did not want) my server offered a salad.  That was a perfect offer for me.
Salad was small, but perfect size for me...nothing fancy, the shredded lettuce and tomatoes that they use for the tacos with some green onions on top..Ranch dressing was the good kind..;-)
My shredded beef taco (which was fried in the kitchen not bought) was ok, at best.  The meat was just a roast shredded with maybe salt and pepper and some chiles..the beans, I am positive came from a can and warmed in the microwave.  Absolutely no flavor.  Just like the tacos, I judge a place on the beans.  Epic fail on this one...Now the Flan, that I was offered and took, was Incredible!!!
Portions are very small with no flair...Nice for me, but might not be for some with larger appetites.
For the price I paid, I will not be going back.  Food was not Mexican at all...$30 for a small lunch for one, is just not worth it, unless it is FANTASTICO!!  I really wish it had been better."}
{"text":"My Hubs and I really wanted to try this place out. We LOVE supporting local business and this place is very close to our house. 
We tried it a few months ago and sorry to say it, but it was not memorable at all. The food was pretty mediocre. I'm a blonde hair, blue-eyed Italian and I have made more flavorful Mexican dishes at home. 
I suppose it's not for those who crave deep authentic flavor, but perhaps it's acceptable for those who prefer a far less authentic flavor than you would expect from a privately owned Mexican Restaurant. 
The place has potential if they updated the interior a bit and changed the menu completely, but it doesn't even feel like a Mexican eatery. It was kind of off-putting. The music was odd, as well. 
We won't be back, unfortunately."}
{"text":"We went inside and asked for a table.  The manager tried to move the table so it wouldn't rock since the floor was made out of the traditional brick just like the adobe I grew up in New Mexico (that was a plus since it was one of the original building in Gilbert).   I am ok with the dated restaurant as long as the service and food were up to par but they were not.  Once we were seated, an unexpected situation happened.  Since we had a voucher from restaurant.com, I pulled up my app from the phone and showed it to the server as required but immediately he told us he cannot accept them because it was not printed out on the paper which is NOT TRUE so according to the contracts they signed.  I had to personally lead him to call them so they can be processed.  He reluctantly did it and was flustered because I asked him make a simple phone call.  Waitress came by and took our order and the food was served promptly.  The food was decent but nothing that special but the attitude from the manager was uncalled for."}
