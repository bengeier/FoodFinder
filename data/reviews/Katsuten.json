{"text":"A nice little place with great food, like home cooking. Good service. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Best Katsu Don I have had in Calgary. On par with some places I ate at in Japan. Takoyaki was very delicious and right amount of crispy on the outside with decent size of octopus meat inside. Definitely plan to return and try out the curry and other options on the menu!! Great service and did not feel overwhelmed but never needed to get the attention of our server."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. High quality food - no dark meat poultry like other places. Friendly staff too. A+"}
{"text":"Good taste overall! But expensive. 

You're paying 16.70 for 5 piece of Chicken Katsu, 4 table spoons of rice, miso soup and a side salad. There are teriyaki places offering double the portions for $11-13 CAD. 
Go here to try the Cheese or Loin Katsu.

{"text":"Neighbourhood Gem. The chicken katsu was flavourful, moist and tender. They make the katsu sauce in house. I'm looking forward to going back and trying other dishes."}
{"text":"I really love their Katsu here! the meat is very tender and juicy! The outside is crispy and not too greasy, which is super surprising. We got curry katsu and okonomi-yaki katsu. Each dish comes with rice, soup, and salad. Very good value and filling. Deep fried gyoza and takoyaki was okay, lacking flavour. I would recommend the the lotus salad if you like red onions.

Will come back! to try their cheese katsu."}
{"text":"Nice little family owned restaurant. Small place and steady stream of people for weekday lunch. The lotus root salad isn't what I would consider a salad since it's merely crispy fried lotus root over thinly shaved onions and dressing but it was tasty. The loin katsu has a nice fluffy and crispy crust from the Glamorgan bread crumbs but my main disappointment was the bottom was soggy. My favorite was the creamy curry udon with the potato cream topping. Portions are on the smaller size."}
{"text":"Have been waiting to try this place. Went last week and had a great experience. Food was great, Katsu is perfectly fried with fresh made breadcrumbs and service was good too. Want to try more dishes on the menu. Reasonable prices. Location gets busy so make reservations. I didn't think I needed them as it was an early dinner but glad I did it anyway!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place to go for a cheese Katsu. My mouth is watering when I think about it. We had Bibinboo, Cheese katsu and assorted katsu. One place is enough for one person, I recommend to have Assorted Katsu for the first visit. The butter is the best."}
{"text":"Had the pork Katsu. Light crispy batter and really tasty. The dipping sauce seems to be their own blend of Tonkatsu sauce. It's served with Miso soup a bowl of rice and a shredded cabbage salad. The salad has a light lemony flavor.
My uncle had the gyu don. It's a beef and onion mixture with egg that's steamed on a bowl of rice. He said it was very tasty. I've had it before and concur with his opinion. 
The prices are a couple If dollars more for entrees as compared to other Japanese restaurants but I guess it's worth it ?

Oh well, not bad food all in all. I shall return in the future."}
{"text":"Really hidden gem in Calgary! D katsu is sooooooo good. U gotta try d cheese katsu. Oh my! One od best i had compared to d amazing ones i tried in Japan. Little bit on d pricey side though."}
{"text":"Got a chance to eat-in on Sunday with the Boy. Previous review applies in all the positive ways and even more. Cant get over how lovely the staff here are either. Great mix of people there to eat too. 

The restaurant actually closes at 8pm on a Sunday night. We were just paying our bill at 7pm when another table came in and had to wait for us as the restaurant had filled up since we got there. So excited this great place is taking off. Think we will have to start making reservations if they take them.

Katsu tastes just like Japan! Loved having someone with me so we could get a bunch of dishes and try them. As I have eaten my way thorough most of the menu we had duplicates of what I have reviewed before.

Tried the cheese katsu this time around and it is delicious. Had left overs the next day and it got a little too oily with the microwaving of the cheese. This dish was better hot and fresh - and man was it super tasty hot and fresh. Great dish to have and share with friends.

Yum, yum, yum!"}
{"text":"Since living in Japan, I have been searching all over Calgary for the last 10 years for katsudonburi that is as close to the real deal as possible. Some restaurants in the city can do an ok job but it's not the same. But my 10 year search is now over!!! Katsuten is offering what is the closest I have come in Alberta to what I ate in Japan. It is so tasty and I can't wait to come back again!!"}
{"text":"The best place for katsu in Calgary. Their tenderloin pork katsu is so crispy outside and tender inside. The size is large. Absolutely delicious dishes."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant. Delicious Katsu, nice decor, friendly and prompt service. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"A hidden gem that is less than 10 minutes away from me, and not in Marda Loop where you can barely find parking.  This place is perfect.

The venue is small, so get there early or book resos, otherwise you'll be waiting, watching the other patrons eat all the delicious dishes coming out of their kitchen.

We had the fried shrimp dumplings, takoyaki, lotus root salad (OMG, make sure you mix the salad to get to the ponzu-like sauce at the bottom - we ordered another one at the end of our meal because it was soooooo good).  Pork Tenderloin Katsu, Cream Curry Udon and the Spicy Beef Yakisoba.

Everything was super tasty.  Glad that the breading on the Katsu comes from Glamorgan Bakery too!  Another plus in my books when local businesses work together.

I'm secretly hoping that Katsuten doesn't explode on popularity - this way I can always get a table when I'm too lazy to plan dinner.

Side Note: Parents with babies/toddlers, the washrooms do not have change tables.  We had to change our little girl in the trunk of our car.  Not very convenient, but I wasn't going to lay her on the ground.  Just an FYI.  Hopefully Katsuten sees this review and installs some foldout change tables.  That would be awesome."}
{"text":"I have to update this place because I just got back from another flawless katsu dinner. The place is spotless, the meal was flawless. So much flavour in the soup appetizer. See my previous review for a full description--just flawless!"}
{"text":"I tried the Katsu Don ($15), Curry and Potato Croquette ($10), and the Gyoza ($6.50). Of the three, I would liked the Katsu the most.  The batter is light and fluffy. The pork itself is tender and thick. The sauce is incredible. Mixed with onions and egg, this was such a delicious dish I can't find anywhere else in the city. 

Recently I tried the Tenderloin Katsu ($15) which was a generous portion and so delicious. The rice has improved too, though still not as good as Shokunin or Redheads. However, I am a rice fanatic, so unless you are too, you probably won't notice the difference. The tenderloin katsu is a winning dish. 

John M, if you are reading this. YOU NEED TO TRY THE KATSU AT Katsuten. It will blow your mind."}
{"text":"Wow there pork katsu is amazing. The crust around the pork is so light and not greasy at all. I got the katsu with curry and it was so delicious. The food is more homey style....The restaurant small but cozy. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. 5/5 for the entire experience."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to take my girlfriend. They have great tasting food and the waiters are always kind. It's also one of the cutest looking restaurants you can find. So if you're looking for a small cute Japanese place. This is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Today eat katsu don, very delicious, just too little sauce."}
{"text":"Saw pictures of this place via Instagram and I had to make my way to get me some katsu! 

Located on 33rd SW, the restaurant is in Richmond shopping mall but I had no idea that this is what the strip mall area was called. We parked on the street directly in front of the restaurant as we did not see any designated parking areas and did not want to get towed/ticketed in case the parking lot was private. 

The restaurant is small and homey, and has lots of cute little decorations. It was basically empty when I visited, but I predict that once people hear about it more, it will fill up and reservations may be a good idea as there is limited seating. We made resos to be safe and they had our table set up for us upon arrival. 

Service was great with lots of friendly servers who offered help if needed. 

We ordered a variety of dishes to get a taste of everything; lotus root salad, tenderloin katsu, cheese katsu, okonomi katsu, potato croquette with curry, kitsune udon, and the cream curry udon. All the mains were served with a side of rice, salad, and miso. The menu is simply laid out with pictures. 

My favourite dish here was the tenderloin katsu - the meat was definitely much tender than the meat used in the okonomi katsu and the cheese katsu. For visual purposes, the cheese katsu looks very impressive but being the priciest item on the menu, I was not extremely wowed. The cream curry udon was interesting with the cream potato on top, and I would have loved this dish if it was served piping hot instead of lukewarm. The potato croquette and curry was also a good dish, and I thought it was a good amount of food and good value. The kitsune udon was good but nothing to write home about. I enjoyed the salad and the dressing which seemed like a homemade dressing with yuzu. 

If I had any advice for the restaurant, I would love it if they could step it up and serve all the food hotter. Not sure if everything just cooled down while waiting to get everything together, but nothing was \"wow-this-just-came-out-of-the-fryer\" hot. I think the udon dishes, especially, would taste much better if they were served hot. I took a star off my rating for this, but hope it can be easily fixed in the future and the place would be a full 5/5. 

TLDR? Parking in front, they take resos, best dish was the tenderloin katsu and overall really good! Try this place out if you have an urge for delicious deep fried goodness :)"}
{"text":"How have I not discovered this place sooner?  It's located on a small and unassuming street - blink-and-you'd-miss-it.  I came here for a late lunch with my brother, who was in town visiting and we decided we wanted some katsu.  It's not very big inside but it's roomy and clean.  I had the tenderloin katsu while my brother had the cream curry udon.  The tenderloin katsu was great.  The meat was so tender and the deep fried goodness outside was light and crispy.  I really appreciate that they had the tenderloin raised on a metal rack on my plate to maintain crispiness.  It was fantastic.  My brother's udon was also very good.  It had a potato cream on top and a curry soup/stew with the noodles on the bottom.  It was a beautiful dish and tasty too!  

In all, it's reasonably priced here and the food is fantastic. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant with great staff. Delicious curry and pork katsu; haven't tried too much beyond that and their cheese filled katsu which is also very good~"}
{"text":"Katsu to die for! Tenderloin katsu was extremely tender and flavorful. Curry was slightly too watery for our liking, but was flavorful. Cabbage salad and tangy/sweet dressing was so refreshing!"}
{"text":"Small casual (no frills) place that serves the most lightest, crispiest katsu that I've had in all of Calgary! They also have a creamy curry udon dish that's quite unique and not found at many places. (small menu, but no problem cuz you're really there to try their katsu!)"}
{"text":"I've had lunch twice here. We stumbled on this place by pure accident driving by a plaza near my office. It's tucked away as part of a plaza and not visible from a major intersection. Bright yellow interior, small and simple. 

1st time- we all ordered the hot stone bibimbap. Oh wow, it was tasty and love how everything stays warm. So many veggies and that sunny side up egg was perfect! One of my gf's is vegetarian and our waitress was very helpful- she offered to remove the beef and add extra veggies, asked if she ate eggs and if so, how she wanted it cooked. I said I was lactose intolerant and she asked if butter was ok for me. So attentive!  We had a lovely lunch at noon on a Tuesday and said we'd return.

2nd time- my gf and I both ordered the loin katsu with curry and shared the shrimp dumplings. These were small pieces but tasty. Not sure if I'd order them again. Also be warned that the \"curry\" is like a gravy with carrots, onions and velvety smooth. It is not yellow Indian or Thai curry in flavour or texture. The flavour is rich like a great gravy that'd I'd pour on steak or Yorkshire pudding.  The loin katsu had an excellent crispy coating and was very thick and filling. I almost didn't finish but was a trooper and left the rice but ate the katsu!!!  If you are the area, stop in for a solid meal.  I'm ready to go back for the bibimbap again next week..."}
{"text":"Review: dinner.

Bottomline: unique boutique restaurant that serves great Katsu (Japanese fried cutlets) plates.

Atmosphere: located in a strip mall in a residential area, this gem is easy to miss if you are not paying attention. The restaurant is small but has a nice Japanese cafe style feel to it. Recommend reso if you are coming here in a group. Service was good.

Food: we ordered the cream curry udon and the cheese Katsu. I was quite impressed with the presentation of the cream curry udon. You could tell they have a passion for making the food here. Taste was good, especially with the cream mixing with the Japanese curry that brings on a new unique twist to curry. However, the ratio of noodle to toppings wasn't great. There were plenty of noodles but not enough toppings. The cheese Katsu, on the other hand, was done very well. Batter was light and fluffy. The cheese was also a nice twist to a classic Japanese dish.

Value: portions were a bit light for the price they were asking for. The dishes weren't expensive, but don't expect to leave with a full stomach."}
{"text":"Went to the restaurant based on good reviews and great pictures.... Chef is not even Japanese and the Korean food that I ordered was so bad that I left as soon as possible to wash my mouth with strong coffee. Fried items look crunchy, but they are not. There is no harmony in ingredients. Way over priced."}
{"text":"I would had NEVER expected to have such quality katsu in (not-even-downtown) Calgary. It was unreal.
Because of work, I had to stay in the city for 5 days. One thing in the city is that everything closes pretty early, so I had to always make sure to have something in my tummy before 9 pm or else I'd get starved until the next noon (because everything opens LATE too).
I was walking around in the neighborhood searching for food around 8 pm and I saw this Katsuten. It was a cozy little restaurant. I wouldn't say the decoration was special in any way. It was more like a family style restaurant -  probably owned by a family and it's also excellent for families.
Although it is marketed as a Japanese restaurant, all the staff & some dishes were modern Korean (e.g., the cream curry udon). However, this did not stop me from dining here because I know some of the Korean restaurants make the best katsu, such as Mr. Tonkatsu in Toronto.
After having a very friendly conversation with the staff (because I love the R&B music they played in the restaurant), I ordered loin katsu ($14.9). The price is definitely not cheap - so I wouldn't say it's a place I would come for every meal if I live in the area.
The meal came with miso soup, rice, and shredded cabbage. Unfortunately, I did not like any of the sides. The miso soup was pretty watery, and the shredded cabbage dressing (lemon) was very mediocre. Just when I was about to accept the fact that Calgary does not have any legit Asian food, I had a bite of that lion katsu. The deliciousness of the flaky breading combined with the juicy pork chop blitzed me, which almost bashed me into another dimension. God, it was SURREAL. The breading was so flaky that it just dissolved in my mouth, yet I could still taste the freshness of the bread they used to deep fry the pork cutlet. It was a surprising moment for me because I just couldn't believe that I could taste a katsu this level in Calgary freaking Alberta. Wow.

In conclusion, if you're here you have to go for its Katsus on the menu. Although the sides were mediocre at best (I'm looking forward to any sort of improvement in the future), the katsu here was on the other level of the food heaven."}
{"text":"Food is consistently excellent. Their tonkatsu has a great texture thanks to the bread crumb crust. Highly recommend the cheese katsu and prawn katsu. I also recommend ordering a side of seaweed salad or lotus root salad."}
{"text":"I've only tried three dishes at this establishment, but I've thoroughly enjoyed the flavours and textures in each one. This place is tucked away, and definitely a gem in the neighbourhood. Each dish has been take out for me, so no pictures will do it justice, but I hope to sit in and ready soon :)"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favour and get over to Katsuten. Their cheese katsu is off the hook. We rolled in here tonight to try something new. We should have known this place was legit. I was the only white dude in the joint ala Lost in Translation. Fast, friendly service, followed by a delicious meal. We will be back!"}
