{"text":"A really luscious breakfast with a. Very good quality food. Dog friendly patio and friendly service. Never a line even on weekends. I had BLT eggs Benedict which were scrumptious. Everything we have tried here is good. It is our go to place for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"This place is nice and quaint. The food is amazing and the service is outstanding. To be greeted by the owner is something that is not done often enough. Not only did our server take care of us but ever one of the waiters/waitresses checked in throughout the meal. Definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"BEST FOOD EVER!!! The pancakes have to be the best I've ever tried.  I also really like the variety of hot sauces they have.  Definetly my favorite breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Was looking for a filling meal that had big breakfast. This was great. Amazing food and it was a great price. I had a huge plate that I couldn't finish for $10. Highly rec"}
{"text":"Not my favorite... My first impression is that it's interior was very dated. The service was outstanding. Our server - a man- was very personable, charming and helpful. The food, though, was terrible. The crepes were spongy. The blueberries were frozen and then heated. The coffee was subpar and the scramble lacked flavor. It was too spicy. It was a custom scramble. It had ingredients I did not ask for and didn't like and 2 ingredients I did ask for were left out. 
Not recommended."}
{"text":"1st time we have been here, service and food was on point! Large size portions and great variety on the menu. They were also able to accommodate our large party of 22 people, which made our Mothers Day breakfast one to remember. It's nice going to a place like this where the owners greet their customers too. Can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"I have had Desert Ray's twice now (once at the restaurant and once on delivery). I wanted to amend my review after going to the restaurant. I can't say enough about how this place is run and the quality of the food. I had the protein pancakes with sunny side up eggs and their smoked brisket (which, apparently, they do on occasion). The brisket came with two heavenly BBQ sauces that they make themselves (they were both incredible). The eggs were awesome! When I got ready to eat the brisket, I got a knife and fork ready, but didn't need the knife. The brisket fell apart with a little prodding from the fork. It was tender and juicy and perfect. The brisket's flavor wasn't overpowering and mixed well with the eggs, toast and both BBQ sauces (sounds weird I know, but it was divine). 

To top it off, my waitress, Julia, was without question the best waitress I've ever had in my life. She gave great recommendations, let me sample things free of charge and made sure I was full and satisfied before I left. Desert Ray's is a gem. Do yourself a favor and go as soon as you can."}
{"text":"I went for lunch for the first time and ordered the half smoked corn beef sandwich and salad.  It was delicious... freshly sliced, juicy, moist, and tender on marbled rye bread.  The side salad was also good with a big portion.  I took my husband 2 days later as I was still relishing the delicious corn beef.  We ordered the corn beef and reuben sandwiches.  We were very disappointed as the corn beef was obviously fried to warm it up and was very dry.  The potatoes in the potato salad was under-cooked and more on the crunchy side.  The rye bread was toasted very hard.  I'm giving them 4 stars mostly representing my first visit as the service was very good as was the overall welcoming look of this local restaurant.  I will probably visit again but avoid the corn beef which is one of their specialties."}
{"text":"Two stars for the meal. Service was awful.  Only two of us in the restaurant and had to wait on placing our order and drink refills. Had to wipe down my table and greasy grime all over top as if it had not been wiped down prior to seating us."}
{"text":"Sitting there for nearly 2 1/2 hours, enjoying morning adult refreshments while our best friend was rushing to get there. Been back several times and have not been disappointed."}
{"text":"We picked up a Uhaul this morning and checked Yelp for a breakfast recommendation nearby. This place is amazing! 

The corned beef hash is made fresh and the corned beef is smoked in-house. Potatoes, carrots, onions and a perfect amount of spice rounds out the hash.

Biscuits and gravy were also very good. Plenty of fuel for a day of packing and loading boxes. I'm just disappointed we found this gem the day before we move to Wyoming.

Even the hot sauces are made in-house!

Hubby had the chicken fried steak breakfast with country potatoes. Probably the best chicken fried steak we've ever tasted.

You won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets. It seems to be a mom and pop run diner in north Scottsdale. I have eaten here several times for breakfast and lunch as I work near it. They also deliver to my job but it is much better dining in. they have all the traditional diner fare breakfast, burgers, sandwiches. All amazing and cooked to order. Their burgers are gourmet compared to other diners and even compared to higher end restaurants. They are  1/2 lb burger patties with toppings like green chile or bacon and choice of cheese. All on a capable, toasted brioche bun. Their onion rings are great and their regular fries are a revelation. Seasoned with a chile powder, paprika, salt blend and fried crispy. They carry local beer on tap from Four Peaks, Huss and San Tan. They also have the usual in cans and bottles. Throw a dart at their menu and you can't go wrong. They never seem busy when I go, early morning or lunch time so service is always good. I have eaten breakfast here more than lunch and it is amazing but trust me their burgers should get more notoriety. My opinion, it is the best place to eat around the Northsight/Frank Lloyd Wright corridor in north Scottsdale and we all know the fare around here."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great variety! Ray greets you at the door and you can hear the passion for his food as he tells you about his specials. Must try!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. Good food, good drinks, good service & a great atmosphere. Their hot sauce is terrific. We bought some to bring home. Don't miss their delicious spicey bloody Mary(made with their hot sauce) and their fabulous Sunday driver(their twist on a mimosa). We had a party of four all order very different things & none of us left disappointed. We will definitely be back & will tell all of our friends about this place."}
{"text":"the smoker outside and the wonderful smoking smell made me go inside after a workout. I ended up buying 1 Lb. of brisket. I planned on this being a family dinner. When I opened it at home i was shocked to find that they gave me the end pieces. Literally 80% white disgusting fat with hardly any meat on it. Trying to separate some meat out of it it wasn't even enough for one person. That was upsetting.  

What made me feel very uneasy is that although I told the guy (the owner?), that it's a to-go, he came out of the kitchen and asked me if we are going to eat it now or later. I said later, thinking it was because he wanted to know if to wrap it in aluminum foil or something. 
Well.. it wasn't wrapped in foil. but now I felt like they intentionally gave me the fat from the end piece knowing I will be far gone by the time I realize it. This feels like it was intentional, how could the cook not see what piece of meat he's packing for me?  feels very uncomfortable.  Like I was intentionally screwed."}
{"text":"The pictures on yelp don't do it justice I tried this for the first time visiting Scottsdale and the food was fantastic I had a strawberry pecan waffle and it was so yummy I devoured it the food is fresh clean appetizing and the servers were so nice I would definitely come back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast on a Sunday morning after the shooting range, which is across the street. No wait for a table, but it was pretty busy. Nice menu, and spacious inside and outside seating areas. Service was sllooww. Took forever to get our food. Had to ask for coffee refills. It was busy, but not crazy busy. Enjoyable breakfast place. Easy parking too."}
{"text":"Though I live in the area, I never go into this plaza so I didn't know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised and equally glad to be supporting a local business. I was impressed by the quantity of food provided for only $10! For 10 bucks I ordered a scrambled egg with choice of 3 veggies and cheese (add meat for extra $1.50), a large hashbrown, and raisin bread.  Overall, my meal was tasty, though there was slightly too much salt in the hashbrowns and perhaps not enough salt in my omelette. The service was friendly and the owner made jokes with us (which I always appreciate!). The interior had a bright and fresh decor that had a seamless transition into the outdoor patio.  Only real downside, the outdoor patio did not face the ocean."}
{"text":"Best chicken and waffles ever!!!  Love this place.  Second time I've been here, and it doesnt disappoint.  Great food, great service.  One of my fav places."}
{"text":"This is the SPOT! Great for breakfast and lunch! If you're looking for a place that isn't super trendy to bypass long lines at lunch, this place is really good and I enjoy the delicious tuna melt :)"}
{"text":"I love coming here  1 or twice a week for their excellent customer service, fresh delicious barbecue their homemade hot sauce and great price."}
{"text":"Awesome food friendly staff good prices good environment come check it out if food is awesome the staff is very friendly"}
{"text":"I just tried to call and verify that they were open today, and someone picked up the phone, waited for 5 seconds, and then hung up."}
{"text":"So delicious! Had the cup and half with Tuscan Soup....plenty of little delicious meatballs in that one cup! I chose the slow cooker corn beef as my half sandwich! Amazing! Boyfriend had the blue cheese burger.....looked delicious, and must have been. He usually offers me a bite but didn't this time! In all fairness, even though I offered him a bite, i didn't  share either. Very reasonable prices for high quality  food. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We were seated right away, which was nice because Snooze was an hour wait...Food was average. Not in a bad way, it just wasn't anything fancy, and I wasn't blown away. Coffee was decent too.  The wait for the food was really long. We really try to wait and not ask our server how much longer, but we had been there probably close to 45 minutes or longer with no food and we were wondering if something was going on..so I asked my waitress and just like that our food appeared. She gave us 5 dollars off our bill for being patient, it was a nice gesture. I'm not gonna say I won't be back, but there's a lot of other restaurants I'll explore first before I return."}
{"text":"This place is not to be missed!!  

I had the smoked corned beef hash and it was phenomenal! A layer of crispy hash browns, a big portion of smoked corned beef all topped with two perfectly cooked eggs. The corned beef was out of this world. 

I'll be back next week for the smoked prime rib!"}
{"text":"Have been to this place twice, and each time had a great experience.

Both times I had ordered off the specials while my fiance took the more traditional breakfast route.  

Today I had the Beef Brisket and Eggs skillet.  Basically a large helping of tender beef brisket, a few scrambled eggs with fresh veggies mixed in.  Perfect combination Desert Ray's!  Had the country potatoes and pancakes for the sides.  Country potatoes where good, and pancakes quite delicious.

Fiancee had the vegetarian Benedict, and judging by how fast she ate, it was very enjoyable.  The poached eggs looked perfectly cooked and glad her English muffin was properly toasted vs being just warm like a few places had served them.  Vegetables where fresh and another good point is the tomatoes where really red, which meant perfectly ripe.  

Now when the food is this good, I can overlook some of the slight service issues.  Please Desert Ray's, train your waitresses to check on their tables.  Had to get up and get my own ketchup.  She was younger, so obviously hadn't been doing this that long, but place wasn't that busy.  Stopped by at the end of breakfast but was personable and friendly. 

 One last small detail- and just because my fiancee was a bit thrown off.  The servers all looked professional in their black polo shirts.  After all, you are charging $12-13 for breakfast, so a clean place (definitely spotless) and a professional staff is important.  So what threw me off was the gentleman who was the host in a green t shirt and orange cargo pants.  When I first saw him, I thought he just came from the gym next door.  Turns out he was the host or manager. (and was very helpful to all guests and friendly- cool guy)....Just saying when your in North Scottsdale, and your place is very tidy and professional, wouldn't it make sense to reflect that?  

Will absolutely come back and if your looking for a good breakfast spot, give them a try."}
{"text":"I can only describe their breakfast and lunch as amazing!! Today I was totally delighted with a brisket sandwich low carb Style - so I could enjoy the crispy waffle fries without too much guilt. But I was torn between that and the waffle sandwich. My husband had a killer brisket omelet and added a biscuit and gravy as a side. There's 6 screens with sports on each and a full bar - try their Bloody Mary! Classic rock playing in the background. Dogs allowed on the patio. Excellent service. And to top that ? It's reasonably priced!!"}
{"text":"It good. Just average. Large portion. I had the custom breakfast scramble. Eggs were over college. Too brown. Coffee is fine. They play classic rock on speakers. Four TVs inside. I sat outside."}
{"text":"One of the few places I can say everything is good on the menu! 

Anytime on that side of town I make a point to stop by for lunch, to always receive a warm greeting to this family owned cheers atmosphere. 

The owner Rick always seems to be adding to the menu upon crafting some very tasty home made hot sauces, highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone"}
{"text":"For a small neighborhood restaurant it offers a lot.  Great food and great prices!  The owner is wonderful and wants you to be happy!  Breakfast is a big hit, and lunch is just as good. The omelettes are excellent, pancakes really good, biscuits with gravy, corn beef hash all a big hit!  For lunch try the chopped chicken salad!  YUM!  Club sandwich, and pulled pork also very good.  We eat there at least once a week and everything is always good.  Melinda, our server is awesome!!  There is a nice room next door that you can use for private meetings or meals. They also deliver!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town. We visit this place every weekend. The weekly specials are always amazing and tasty. This weekends brisket smelled and tasted like heaven!"}
{"text":"Restaurant looks like they didn't even paint from the last restaurant was in there. Dirty looking. Worst tasting and looking omelette I've ever had. Eggs aren't suppose to be brown. My $3 pot coffee was burnt."}
{"text":"Awesome food, Awesome service..  Have never had a bad experience.  Very homemade taste..  Of-coarse, my favorite of all is the chicken fried steak breakfast.   Sunday's, Ricks BBQ is out of this world with flavor."}
{"text":"I'm so thankful I came across Desert Rays one morning as my stomach was digesting itself from being so hungry, while sitting at my desk. Desert Rays has amazing, fresh-made healthy breakfast (depending on what you order... 'cause those crepes, not so healthy, but oh so yummy!), and guess what?! They DELIVER!!! Yes, you heard right -- you can order delicious breakfast while at work or wherever you are, and they will deliver it to you! How amazing is that?!?! 

I've ordered from here a few times and the breakfast croissant is so finger-licking good, and the crepes are phenomenal! I have yet to venture out to order other items off their menu, but I'm sure they're great... and I will order from them again. Their customer service is wonderful too -- every time my food got delivered, the guys are the sweetest!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute! Warm, family based staff and, amazing food! Professional and delicious! Awesome visit! Such a great choice for brunch. Lunch and breakfast all day. Great big luxurious bar with thee best mimosas!"}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast there and was able to bring the dog on the patio really enjoyed it good food"}
{"text":"Prices are almost amazing as their house made specialties, always more than enough to eat and found out on Sundays they always have a special addition to the menu like crabcakes Benedict or Prime Rib and eggs! Best, most generous Mimosas I've experienced anywhere! The staff is great and the owner is generally there and a lot of fun to talk to. I would highly recommend this place to anyone The north Scottsdale area!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing...great patio, bloody Mary's, awesome food...a must try! And the staff is great too....very friendly and happy!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife found rays when another place we wanted to goto fell through because they we not open on Sunday. 

We came about 11 am on Sunday. This place is big with nice outside area and large inside area. The owner smokes his own meats for lots to the items on the menu we were told. 

My wife had breakfast and I had lunch. She tried the crepes were \"ok\" And the eggs Benedict was good. 

She said the coffee was great. She had lots. Free refills!

I had the green chili cheese burger. Wow best green chili burger I have ever had. Perfectly cooked. The meat had a nice flavor. Pepper jack cheese which was melted into the beef. Yum! Defiantly not food service beef. It also had bacon and lots of mild green chills! Soooo good. They will also cook your beef to order. I had medium but you could also have gotten it Med rare. I will try that next time. 

The waitress Izzy was super friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. She suggested the fries and I also added onion rings to try. Both were awesome! Both were hand made. Great flavor on the onion ring batter. I asked for well done on both and they both were perfectly cooked.  

Music is classic rock which we both love. Not too loud which is nice. The place was spotless including both bathrooms. Owner works at the restaurant and is very attentive and friendly.

Overall service was 5/5 on a busy Sunday. My wife and I give it a 5/5 overall."}
{"text":"We have been twice. I enjoyed the pancakes, even though I ordered the fried steak and they were just on the side. Wife likes the eggs benedict. Good service and food."}
{"text":"I came here the other day with my boyfriends sister and oh my lord. It was phenomenal! My taste buds are watering thinking about the burrito that I ate there. And the salsa that they made.  it was huge. It was the breakfast burrito. It had potatoes, red bell peppers, and egg and probably a couple other things and then I had the choice between chorizo, bacon, steak and chicken I think? I don't know but I chose chorizo and it was so yummy with that. Even after I got full I just wanted to eat more.  but couldn't. It was so good. And they're very nice. It's a cute little place. I sat outside cause it was a nice day. Definitely recommend coming here."}
{"text":"The company I work for & I WERE regular customer of Rays.....notice the word 'were\". 

We would always call in our order & it would either be delivered or we would pick up since we're not too far from their cafe. We LOVED their breakfast and lunch! Over the past two months or so the customer service and even the food as gone down hill. Orders would be incomplete or totally wrong, food over cooked (never under thank goodness), phones would never be answered when we would call in our order.

Last week was the final straw with this place! My co-workers and I wanted some delicious breakfast from Rays. We called, no answer. We figured they were super busy and tied up. So we waited a bit to call again. We called back. No answer. This went on for a good hour. Finally someone answered, then completely hung up on us! We gave up and never ordered that day. 

Come yesterday, my co-worker called. No answer. He went down there. He called right from the booth she was sitting in. NO ANSWER! He heard the phone ring, saw a worker there with the phone, completely ignored his call! He asked to speak to a manager. When He asked one of the workers to speak to the manager the worker said \"hes busy\" with major attitude. He was never able to speak to a manager so that's why I'm writing this review. Hopefully the manager or owner will see this.

We will NEVER give Rays our business again. We always told our clients to grab breakfast or lunch at Rays to kill time while they are hanging around our business for a bit. Not anymore. 

Come on Rays! Get it together!

We can't wait for Butters to open up next to Rays. Butters will get our business & our clients as well."}
{"text":"Underwhelming breakfast selection for the price, all items, even the\"protein\" tied to pancakes or hash browns, so we ordered two salads, stuffed tomato and strawberry.... both took FOREVER to come out and were lackluster at best. It's no wonder there's no wait and plenty of empty seats. No doubt the interior was \"male inspired\" with sparse outdated sports pics and childhood looking art on the walls."}
{"text":"High quality breakfast.

I ordered the country fried steak.  It is very good.  Crunch texture on the outside.  A solid 4.5 stars.

Pancakes were light, fluffy and tasty.  The maple syrup isn't the usual high fructose maple flavor syrup.  This is the real deal.  It tastes good.  I can tell the difference.  I asked the waitress and she confirmed it was 100% pure maple syrup.

5-stars for the high quality food at an affordable price and they give you so much food for the money.  Waitress is great."}
{"text":"As the old adage goes, your employees can make you or break you and it is about time someone recognized the manager Tom for his infantile and self centered attitude. Nothing like coming in on a Sunday morning to head banging screaming guitars blaring over the sound system.

The servers and line cooks are all pleasant and hard working people but in all honesty there really is nothing so spectacular here on the menu that couldn't be found at Denny's at a much more reasonable price unless you just can't pass by on a Mimosa or Bloody Mary with breakfast.

One other thing I found kind of strange. There are about six things on the menu called \"Desert Rays\" this or that. Is that because you don't want the patrons to forget where they are dining or is it because the owners are having some kind of identity crisis?"}
{"text":"I am so glad we found this spot! The food was fresh and delicious and the staff was friendly and attentive. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is the best family-owned restaurant in the neighborhood. My family and I come here every Sunday for breakfast, but they have a great lunch menu too. The owner smokes his own brisket and ribs right out front. It is hands down the best BBQ I've had. And rumor has it, he is opening a BBQ restaurant right next door. The service is always friendly, warm and welcoming. The food is always outstanding. If you want to support local business, COME CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place for breakfast or brunch. Menu has alot to offer. I am ordering each different item everything I come. I recommend  everything. Come and try this yummy restaurant , you won't be disappointed. Clean, you can eat inside or enjoy our weather outside.  This is a must."}
{"text":"Fucking gross. I am a waitress. I got my eggs benedict with a BUNCH of hair in it, and I took out my knife and there was hair on the knife, my bacon was freezing cold, as if it was just sitting their.. the OWNER was sitting RIGHT BEHIND US.. he clearly heard my moms obnoxious mouth and my mouth bitching about the hair and we went to say \"excuse me!\" And he picks up and walked in the back completely ignoring us.. DISGUSTING NEVER GO. How do you even bring out food with THAT much fucking hair."}
{"text":"Corn Beef Hash....for breakfast...with anything else...but just try it...not like your mamma made it! A-maz-zing!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Locally owned and operated. Ownership is in the restaurant almost everyday and is one cool dude! 

By far the best home cooked breakfast in North Scottsdale! Smoked Brisket Hash is unbelievable!"}
{"text":"This is honestly one of the best breakfast places I have ever been to and the experience  was not only incredibly delicious and satisfying,  but unique as well.   Where else can you order a mini rack of carefully seasoned and smoked ribs that fall off the bone alongside,  eggs,  perfectly prepared crispy hash browns and smothered biscuits with gravy ? 

   There is a run-of- the-mill Butters slow fast food place right next door but skip it. 
This is real food with real thick bacon and bold and hearty tastes that any discerning diner truly appreciates.   Reasonable but super high quality. 

The owner was very nice and told us how he personally prepares the meats. 

Don't miss this place.  You'll be coming here over and over, and you don't have to deal with the waits like the trendy spots or the slpw fast food joints that serve predictable (but boring)  food.  
Loved this breakfast ! Perfect start to the day after church."}
{"text":"Stopped in after church for a little brunch. We sat up at the bar and Rick (owner) told us Ribs & Eggs were the special for the day ~ Vince was in!  I ordered the Eggs Benedict. Vince ordered a Bloody Mary and I said I would decide after I tasted his. Mine was on its way as soon as I sipped his!  Food came shortly after and I was so pleased - they toasted my English muffin well as requested and the hollandaise sauce was perfect, not too thick or too rich. Vince asked if I wanted a bite of his rib and since it looked nicely cooked and not drowning in sauce I did.... He got a bare bone back!  Wow!  Cooked perfectly, dry rub seasoning was amazing and the sauce stole my heart (weird since I normally prefer no sauce).   It was so good in fact I had to walk out with my own bottle!  Can't wait to go back and try more. In fact Rick said next week is Prime rib & Eggs."}
{"text":"Pésima comida, los huevos más horribles que he podido comer. La fruta sabía a jabón de manos. Pedí cambio de los huevos 2 veces y no entendieron el cambio. Solo pedí huevos con salchicha y me trajeron unos huevos horribles con una salsa y unos jalapeños encima. Horrible definitivamente"}
{"text":"Stopped by for brunch on our way home from camping. Friendly and prompt service, great fresh food and great prices. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great food, quick service and very reasonable prices! My egg white omelette with spinach and jack cheese was cooked to perfection!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend for breakfast the morning after moving to Scottsdale. Great little breakfast place tucked away a bit. Almost missed it, but found the patio seating. Great food, great service, will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Very friendly and personable staff. They have free wifi and made sure to let us know which was awesome. Both had the 2 eggs your way with meat and it was so good! Great amount of food for the price."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and the food is excellent.  The owner makes his own hot sauces and they are definitely worth trying.  Overall, excellent laid back place with comfort food."}
{"text":"We were in on 3/13/16 at 10:45am It took over 5 minutes to even be acknowledged we were there. We were then seated and then proceeded to wait another 10 minutes and no one came by and offered to take our order or acknowledge us. 

All the while several waitresses made eye contact with us. One employee was taking pictures of the several people standing waiting to be served. We got up and left. Obviously, management does not need our business. My wife and I wanted to try a new place for breakfast needless to say this will will be the last time we go there. It looks like a great place, but needs to work the bugs out of their service. 

Try it your own risk."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast today. It was not crowded, so we got a table right away outside. The manager took our drink order and said the server would be over to take our order. We never did see the server, but the manager took our order, and checked back often.  The food was delicious and the portions were generous.  All in all a.good experience"}
{"text":"I was at Desert Ray's last week for breakfast. Really delicious. Service was slow and not attentive. Went back today for lunch. Very slow service again. No refills on iced tea. The BLT was very good. Food is good; service not so good. Seemed to be lazy considering there were only 6 customers. The Cole slaw was inedible as well according to my friend and myself."}
{"text":"When you wait more than 45 minutes for your order to come out after placing it you would think they should get it right,  WRONG!!!  Several families got up and left instead of waiting for their orders,  The place always seems to have an excuse of why it takes them so long to get their orders out.  We will not be going back, they were not able to do anything right today and the orders came out wrong and they did not even give us credit for the long wait.  Terrible management terrible customer service.  You Have been WARNED"}
{"text":"This place is pretty ok. Service is kind enough. Food is great. I ordered the Trio Fruit Crepes, which were yummy (I love crepes)! The pancakes are delicious but the syrup isn't too good. The owner is kind and has homemade salsas and sauces. Fun kids menus with fun puzzles on it. With this place, there is a 99.9% chance there will not be a wait, which is great! 
The outside of the building is just beige with words, which is boring. The inside looks dated and the walls are bare except for a few small paintings and pictures. The hard-rock music is horrendous (unless you're into that). When we walked in, we were greeted with a song called, \"Hell is for Children\". 
I recommend this place as a good food, good service, and no wait place."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Very clean, service wasn't that quick but the quality of food was worth the wait. Both my children ate almost all their food( which is rare). The portions were large so I recommend sharing. We will definitely be coming back to our new breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Breakfast burrito was the best I've had. Owner is a great guy, comes around and greets everyone. It's a can't miss!"}
{"text":"What a great atmosphere, the food was delightful! So glad we stopped by! A \"must\" visit again!  Prime rib Sunday, third Sunday of the month.  Would love  to do \"paint night\".  Will be back for a \"morning drive!\""}
{"text":"This review is crazy late.  When I came to visit Phoenix months ago,  I got lucky and found this place on yelp. First off, the gentleman that greeted and waited on us, was marvelous.  He made the experience there really nice.  We sat outside and enjoyed a good ass breakfast.  The rendition of a mimosa was so good. I think it had vodka in it. 
Now that I'm back in Arizona, I'm hoping to get to be able to go back to this place"}
{"text":"Visting from LA and found this on yelp.  Everything EXCELLENT!!!!   Spotless ( which is always first thing i look for).  Four of us each rated our food a 10.  The hollandaise sauce the best I've ever had.  The belgian waffle and chicken fried steak my dining partners loved!!!  Service and music excellent!!!!   Dont miss this place."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since it's been Desert Ray's... and i have no complaints. I've always gotten service that's perfectly fine, my food has always been good, and the prices are where they should be -- something that can be hard to find in this part of North Scottsdale. There's a fairly good chance this will be my go-to Lazy Sunday Morning spot for eggs, toast, and coffee. Will the food here blow your socks off? Probably not... but it's not bad either. Personally, i'm happy to find a comfortable, unpretentious, affordable spot for breakfast that has good portions and nice help. That checks off enough boxes for me. (And bonus points for a patio, since it's about to be gorgeous outside.)"}
{"text":"Our waitress was great. The breakfast steak was better than most any you will find for breakfast usually. Overall great breakfast"}
{"text":"Thanks Rick and staff for all the great food and service. We're going to miss the food and everyone. Best of luck to everyone."}
{"text":"You ever go on a mercy date because you just felt so bad for the girl?

I admit to feeling guilty about parking in front of Desert Rays in the morning, because they're right next to my gym.  I've taken up my fair share of their premium parking, so one day, while sitting in my car, staring at their lackluster signage, I looked them up on Yelp, and was surprised by their high rating... so I figured I'd give them a go... another day.

Well that day came, and I walked in... to a nearly deserted dining area.  There was an old lady in there, but I couldn't see her as the booth backing eclipsed her height.

A super peppy employee, named Julia, emerged from a hole in the wall, and gave me an excited welcome... a welcome you might receive when visiting Iwo Jima, say if you stumbled across someone who's been in hiding since March of '45 and hasn't had much social interaction since then, outside of the occasional one-sided dialog with a flame-thrown corpse.

Choosing my seating, I ordered the Desert Rays Combo with scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and buttermilk pancakes.... a good value at $8... but I gotta say, the more Julia lauded my visit, the more uncomfortable I became.  Now them there pancakes were kinda weird in taste and consistency... everything else was good, but what I really wanted was to taste the freedom of society, outside of this demure dining area.  I paid my bill and Julia rewarded me with an over-sized $5 coupon, which I conveniently tucked into my Costanza wallet and summarily forgot.

I returned 2 days later, because I read good things about their crepes, and this time, I got gruff and stumble, muscular jack, in his compression Under Armour shirt.  You better believe I straightened my act up, as I ordered the crepes with fresh strawberries.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not a player in the crepe game, nor am I even an armchair quarterback... but serving crepes topped with cold fruit and a heaping mound of fresh made whipped cream sounds MUCH more appealing than what I got... a ball of cold butter and maple syrup... which curiously enough, is also what I got 2 days prior with my weird hotcakes.

The worst part... ABSOLUTE WORST PART... is that I forgot to use my colossal sized coupon... which means I wont be dropping this review until after I've returned one more time to cash in on my discount"}
{"text":"I was a weekly regular until I questioned the Mgr about a $12 check. The same order was around $6.50 on their menu? When I inquired to Tom the Mgr he sarcastically replied that he'll give me a free order of toast on my next visit and the waitress was only 16 years old and doesn't know better. How about a price adjustment Tom? Keep the free toast and sarcasm as I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Good little breakfast place when you don't feel like the old town scottsdale breakfast/brunch scene. Very low key. Not crazy loud and overcrowded. Very very fair prices, big portions-we should have shared. We tried the chicken fried steak and eggs. It was good! They make it in house. Good service from the gal we had and we were in and out quick! We used to come here for the chicken fried steak when it was the breakfast joynt and I would say it's better now. The pancakes were good too-soft and fluffy. Next time I'll try the country potatoes the hash browns that we ordered were just okay, but we are picky with our hash browns :) All in all a decent place to grab a quick breakfast when you are too lazy to do it at home."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food at exceptionally fair prices with consistent and friendly service. This is the kind of diner you take for granted on the east coast but are ever so grateful to have found one here in sunny north Scottsdale. Come taste for yourself."}
{"text":"This restaurant has had a name change to Desert Ray's Cafe.  I think ownership changed.  The Windy City Cafe sign is still on the building but there is a banner with the new name hanging over the entry.  

I eat breakfast here once weekly.  The food and service are generally good and typical of most breakfast spots.   I have had just enough minor issues (undercooked pork chop, way too many potatoes and not enough meat in their breakfast skillets, no toast after requesting it twice, etc) that I can only give them a 3 star \"average\" rating.

I would recommend Desert Ray's Cafe to anyone looking for an average - good breakfast spot, but not to someone who needs perfection to be happy."}
{"text":"I don't usually do breakfast food but the chicken fried steak and pancakes here are awesome. 
Portions are huge you get a lot for the price. Would recommend for anyone wanting a hearty mean with big portions"}
{"text":"Stopped in with some friends for breakfast after a morning hike. Delicious food:waffles, eggs Benedict, and lovely crispy bacon and hash browns. Service was friendly and efficient. We all agreed we looked forward to a return visit to try some of their lunch items."}
{"text":"We found this on accident and are so happy we did! Amazing breakfast, great service! The pancakes are so so good too! Better than Butters, best breakfast hands down!"}
{"text":"What an adorable cafe! Service was great, food was perfectly cooked as well. I had 2 poached eggs, an english muffin, cottage cheese and fruit. The fruit was all fresh and there were strawberries, melons,grapes and pineapple. My friend had biscuits and gravy, scrambled eggs and bacon. Portions were big and she loved, loved, loved the bacon. The chef, Tim,  came out and checked on our order and chatted us up a bit. He was so personable and it was a real treat since chefs don't generally do that. If I'm back in that area, I'd definitely go back. Also as a side note, they serve booze."}
{"text":"Good breakfast joint. My husband loved the corned beef hash (they smoke the meat themselves). I had a scrambler with chorizo, avocado & cheese - I ate it all including my crispy hash browns, which is is not like me! Gluten-free pancakes were pretty gross but the kids loved their regular pancakes. Super friendly service - the owner helps out in the dining room AND cooks. He makes his own hot sauces too, which I found too sweet but my husband liked them enough to buy a bottle to bring home. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Nice discovery! Very friendly service, good prices & good breakfast. This place delivers to businesses & residents. That's convenient. We live in Northern California & it's a great idea to deliver breakfast & lunches to the local area.  Discover this place. It's was a nice find."}
{"text":"I left work on a mission to find an early, delicious and NOT fast food lunch. Yelp, as usual, came to my rescue. Desert Rays is tucked away alongside a few other places and the jumbo sized gym next door. As I walked in I was greeted by everyone working, it felt like Cheers...but newer and in North Scottsdale. :) 

I hung out at the bar to place my order and the man working was super friendly. I picked up a burrito and the Desert Ray's pancake plate....not sure on the names. My buddy at work loved his burrito and the pancakes were GIGANTIC. For the quick experience I had it was definitely a good one. Although I live in Tempe I'm sure I will be back. Although next time I will sit at the bar and have a bloody mary with my brunch instead of a water."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch today with a co-worker. We walked in and there were only two other tables, each with just one person at each table. The server was behind the bar at the computer and told us to grab any seat and she'd be with us in a few minutes.

Literally five minutes later she finally came over with menus. We quickly made up our mind and put in the order. One of the people looked like they'd been waiting a while, but got his food maybe five or so minutes after we ordered. He was completely done with his food and had left before we got our food. And our server didn't check on us once during that time.

She came out with the food, asked us if we needed anything, and proceeded to watch tv and talk to a co-worker for about fifteen minutes. She finally came over close to our table but not even all the way and asked us if we were ok. I saw her glance at my almost empty water so I figured I didn't need to point out I needed more water. Apparently I was incorrect. 

She didn't come back to check. I finished half of my meal with no water at all. Even when she came to clear the table a good eight to ten minutes after we were done eating and had stacked our napkins on top of the plate (the clear \"we're done here\" sign), no water was offered. 

Our server spent all of her time talking to a coworker rather than helping us. The only reason I have it two stars was because the food was actually pretty good. But it's obvious that there's a reason we were the only people there at 12:15 when we left...that's no way to run a business and it looks like I'm not the only one to say this exact thing.

Even though this place is literally walking distance to my work, I will not be going back. And I won't be recommending it to any coworkers. It's really a shame considering there just aren't that many food options in the area."}
