{"text":"Compass restaurant heading in wrong direction As a member of the Bronte Outer Harbour Marina, my friends and I visited for lunch. What appears to be high-class dining is only a facade of overpriced food, cold waitstaff, and an awful clash of ingredients. After ordering our $35 meals, we waited an hour for it to arrive. Upon arrival, we could not even finish our meals. The ricotta cheese balls were inedible as they were swimming in butter. The $25 burger was horrendous. Hugely disappointed. I'd rather have eaten at a halfass fast food joint than this place again. To top it off, food poisoning was the cherry on top of our unpleasant meal. That night caused severe stomach pains. NEVER will i go back. It's no wonder the people of BOHM don't eat here."}
{"text":"Visited Compass this weekend for dinner. View was great overlooking the Marina and lake.  Unfortunately that was the only highlight of the visit. Experience was just a series of small disappointments that when put together made for a poor dining experience.  Two hostesses working the front desk yet waited over five minutes before either was at the front desk. Petty ? Maybe.  Had to wait for cutlery. Drink orders slow without garnish.   Waiter was very pleasant but wasn't aware of the menu items. When I asked about the Daily Beef Special He replied its a big hundred dollar platter seemingly steering me from this expensive option. When I asked what items it included he said he wasn't sure but it had fries and meat, and some potatoes he thought. When I asked what cut of meat he seemed surprised I'd want to know and said he could ask if I wanted. Chose other options , Salmon for myself, chicken for my girlfriend. Sadly both options were very average, neither seemed to have any flavour and  frankly would have below average at any restaurant or my own kitchen. Word of advice pass on the Kale Ceasar...  Portions were good and prices would have been fine had the meal been even close to what we expected.   End of the day just a series of small missteps that made me question the training and commitment of staff and management. . Below average food at a premium price.   Definitely not a repeat."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for their buffet lunches, evening dinner and just to chill on the patio. I love the lake view on the patio and will be back this summer!"}
{"text":"I wanted to share our delicious experience we had last week.   We booked a reservation for 8 for my fiance's 30th birthday and we were so happy we chose this place. Everything was done to perfection- the lively ambience (bonus points for it being a beautiful night and sunset), tasty local wine and phenomenal  service ( thanks steve). The tomahawk rib eye, pizza, buzzalo moz pot and the sharing dessert was so delicious (yes i took a bite of everything)  We will certainly be back and so will our friends. Thank you for making my fiances night one to remember!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant .... Good staff (especially Sarah) ...... Lovely view ... Helped us celebrate my MIL's birthday ... We will be back"}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place. Amazing view and the gnuddi was the most dish I have had in a long time  I went back with a girlfriend for after work drinks and the ceasars were to die for!"}
{"text":"We went me and my wifey and another couple. We had very nice dinner experience. It was not crowded on Friday evening. Very good view, friendly staff, good food slightly pricy though."}
{"text":"Great portions, options, views and drinks.  A new place with decent wait staff, it isn't downtown Oakville, but you get to sit on the docks of Bronte Harbour!"}
{"text":"It's a hidden gem.  This makes for an quiet family brunch or a lovely romantic dinner by the water. I came here for lunch with my family after some wedding planning at the banquet hall.  Decor Classy, clean, modern. Comfortable chairs and bench seats. A gorgeous view of the water and docks.   Food Started off with fresh bread, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. The variety of oils and vinegars was lovely - Black currant, and black currant reduction, olive oil, garlic oil, and something sweet. We also got pizza for appetizer with chicken and peppers on it. It's got a bit of heat to it. Very tasty.  I ordered the Porcini mushroom risotto for entree. It had A LOT of mushrooms! Yum! Unlike many places I've been to, risotto to mushroom ratio was 80/20.  The bison burger was tasty. I like goat cheese, especially on meats that tend to be leaner or gamy. I didn't add any condiments to the burger just so that I could really enjoy the natural flavours. It was cooked to perfection - medium rare. The fries are pretty good too! Crispy on the outside, fluffy and light on the inside.  I also tried the apricot bread pudding with a white chocolate vanilla bean ganache. It was very moist. Not too sweet, not too heavy. Good balance. I'm always afraid of desserts that have too much sugar.   Value Worth every penny. Individual portions are not HUGE. I think they are perfect. You will be stuffed if you order an appetizer and dessert.  Presentation and taste are both great.   Service Amazing service. Kind gentleman with a great sense of humour. Comes by regularly with water and ask if everything is good (not to the  extent that interferes with your conversation).  Location Blame it on the urban planners, but I think this part of the harbour makes Toronto look bad. It makes it a great space to take your children, walk the dog, or take your date. It's charming.  I would definitely go back and try other dishes. I envy those who live in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"A very pricy place with average food. Salt and pepper calamari way too salty. Pull pork sandwich is very good. Fish and chips had more batter than fish. Took a while for the service . they do have great view . Decent place to have few drinks."}
