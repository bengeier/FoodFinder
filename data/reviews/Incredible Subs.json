{"text":"Awesome! Nice people! I just went in for my first time, got a BLT and it's great! I will be back."}
{"text":"This place was great when the old owner ran the shop but now it's unreal... The Sub shop had no Sub Bread? Only flat regular bread like iron kids - no joking it was a horrible experience!

And my wife and I were the only ones in the shop and it took 40+ minutes to get the nasty sandwiches - if you call them sandwiches. 

*STAY CLEAR!!!"}
{"text":"This place is just meh.  Been here a few times over the years and experienced the different owners.  It's consistently the same which is good, if you have your favorite, but I am just not a huge fan.  If I want a sub, there's probably 3 or 4 places I could go to in the area that would be a little bit better.  It also takes them a long time to make your order, the last time I went, I believe I ordered a pastrami sandwich and it took a good 25 minutes to get it.  I have no major complaints, but also no major compliments.  The d√©cor is pretty boring, plastic tables and chairs.  You know....just meh."}
{"text":"I like the place because it's independent and unique,  the people are super friendly.  

Good spot to hit for lunch if you're in the mood for something a little different but not too different from your usual lunch stops.

*Edit:   I've just found out that they are under new ownership since I wrote the above review.    Just had lunch there today & it was better than before - generous and fresh,  I definitely don't mind paying an extra buck or two (vs. nationwide bargain sandwich shops)  for higher quality and Incredible Subs tasted like quality to me."}
{"text":"I am so glad that I stopped by here! The staff is so friendly and they took care of me even though I can be a picky eater. This is what a real sandwich tastes like! This place is hidden gem inside a business park and I am glad that I found it. Everything was so fresh, crispy lettuce, juicy tomatoes and lots of meat! You will not regret trying this place! Oh and try their salads! They are just as amazing!"}
{"text":"Not so incredible subs. Got the Italian sub and it was Below average at best. Friend got a turkey/bacon/avocado and it didn't have avocado. I will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"Nice, friendly people, but, oh, so slow. 13 minutes for a sub? No one else in here, so, not busy. Good food."}
{"text":"First time there and not impressed at all. Not incredible. My stomach is paying the price for it now.... watch out. Service isn't good either. Took 20 mins for them to make 3 sandwiches when they had no line, no one waiting, no rush what so ever. The meat and chicken and stuff was just sitting on the counter in the back ans even at that point u should have thought about not ordering anything. As I said my stomach is paying the price now and only thing good there was packaged bag of chips!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Italian sub. The meat was thick carved fresh meat- not your average sliced deli meat. Staff was super friendly and I appreciate the diverse hiring of staff here. I'll definitely be back. Yum!"}
{"text":"Was jonesing a tuna fish Sammie and I was close to this place. Normally tuna sammies are never filling due to the lack of tuna salad in them. Not here. On my second bite tuna was falling out of the Sammie. Good tuna too, not too much celery or onions. It's kinda hard to find so defiantly want to map it. By no means is this the end all be all Sammie joint but based on the prices it's a heck of a lot better than the national chains."}
{"text":"This place is one of those low key hidden establishments in large business parks that serve to the surrounding swarm of computer desk warriors. The place itself is pretty nice with indoor and outdoor seating. Since it is a mom and pop sub shop they are extremely helpful and friendly. They have a soda fountain and a selection of chips (they have Ms. Vickie's) which is a bonus since it is a local family lunch stop. It helps that the food is pretty darn good as well.

Nice, simple, fast, and local = a win in my book."}
