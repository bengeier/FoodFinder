{"text":"This place is awesome! They have an amazing variety of pizza to choose from and each slice is HUGE. All the ingredients taste delicious. The pin up girls Asia and Angela were adorable. Very kind, always smiling, really funny too. Had me laughing and smiling from the moment I stepped in to the moment I walked out. Definitely the best spot to grab some pizza on the strip everyone should check this place out."}
{"text":"First off, the slices are HUGE! Kinda ridiculous actually, but after a night of drinking, easier to eat most of it than you'd think.  I had a margarita slice and my friend had sausage. Mine was better but was only good hot out of the oven. By the time I got to the middle, it was soggy. The crust end was just ok.  If the whole slice was a good as the first 1/3 of the slice (yes, I said 1/3, I wasn't kidding it was HUGE!) Then I would have given it another star, maybe 2."}
{"text":"Three stars! One star each for: FOOD, PRICE and \"WILL I COME BACK?\" No stars for SERVICE and AMBIENCE.

I got two slices to go. Each slice was HUGE. Ordered a cheese slice and a specialty (ham + potato something) slice. Ate it cold as they ran out of to-go boxes and I had to carry the slices back on open paper plates. Why not eat at the shop? I hear you ask. Well, there is minimal seating (outdoor) and it was early morning. Which meant having to dodge drunk \"whoo-hoo!!!\" girls as they puke out their sugary pink drinks and pizza. So nope, I grabbed my slices to-go.

Cost about US$15 for two slices. Not bad, considering the location. 

I was promised service by \"pin up girls\". But no such luck. Serving guys behind the counter was brisk and efficient. Two cashier girls spent a few minutes chatting among themselves (probably changing shifts) before one surly asked me what I ordered and ringing me up.

\"Will I come back?\" Yes. But will be a quick stop to grab and go. Early morning on the Strip is not for the faint hearted."}
{"text":"Perfect place to get a late night slice of salt topped with cheese and pepperoni   Disgustingly salty - couldn't eat more than two bites.."}
{"text":"Sooooo yummy. Perfect crispy thin crust with proper proportion of cheese, aside and pepperoni. Huge slices for $5.50!"}
{"text":"Service: 
The service we received when we ordered was excellent. The workers are very friendly! 

Location:
Located inside Planet Hollywood & right on the strip. Very easy access.

Food:
We got one pepperoni slice and one cheese slice. The slices are HUGE and the pizza is pretty tasteful. I thought the pizza had way too much grease on top though.

Price: the price is right on!

Seating: I did not find any actual seating area at Pin Up Pizza.. Only found a standing area where you can put your plate down. There may be an actual seating area that I missed.. But standing up and eating a giant slice of pizza is not my thing.

Overall:
Check this place out if you're looking for a giant slice of pizza and pay only 5-6$."}
{"text":"Amazing slices of heaven is what it should be called! Great tasting pizza and the garlic knots were out of this world!! Not even exaggerating. Before I left I just had to buy some more to take to my room!
Great atmosphere, cool service! Very friendly people that work here. Massive sized pizzas for anyone with a big appetite. 
Good price and flavors
Will definitely come back for more!!!"}
{"text":"Very large slices and inexpensive! The Margherita pizza was very tasty and filling. Customer service was great. The staff threw in an extra garlic knot!"}
{"text":"I have lived on the west coast for about 8 years. This is the first pizza since moving that tastes like NY pizza. Tasted like home. Amazing!!!!! If you're from NY, especially if you miss NY pizza, do not pass this up."}
{"text":"The service was horrible. The dark haired girl with tattoos was so rude to the female customers. She ignored my girlfriends and I and was helping the men behind us first. She also tried to sell us a whole pizza for $70. The pizza was so so. Would not recommend especially with employees like her!"}
{"text":"I was here last night at approximately 2:30a with some friends of mine. We chose this place as a late night fix, after a less than stellar night out on the town. Located in the front of Planet Hollywood and right on the strip, we stood on a line no longer than five minutes which was amazing, considering how hungry we were! 

They have a few choices as far as pizza & their toppings are concerned. However, the few that they do have pretty much cover all of the basic pizza topping flavor criteria necessary for a successful slice of pizza. 

I was stuck between the Margherita pizza (Mozzarella and tomatoes) and the traditional pepperoni pizza. So what does any person in this situation so??? I GOT BOTH! 

The slices here are HUGE! And I am both proud and ashamed to say that I killed both of them without hesitation. The pizza here is so deliciously authentic, fresh, and perfectly warmed so that the cheese marinates your mouth with all of the other complimentary toppings. 

The service behind the counter taking the pizza orders wasn't really that great, however the girl that took the money at the cash register was an absolute doll. You can tell that even with the array of drunks that probably had made their way beforehand, she was still in good spirits and ready to serve us!

All in all, I love this place. The pizza is top notch, and the prices (low to moderate) are pretty spot on considering the monster slices they supply you with. Definitely give this a shot if you are down for some good pizza."}
{"text":"Good quality pizza and fast  service we liked the options of veggies and meat kind of new York style thin and delish."}
{"text":"Have gone here on my last 2 Vegas trips. Will be a repeat offender for as long as they are there. Delicious, HUGE slices well worth the money. Salami trio is my favorite."}
{"text":"Nice BIG Slice including a Garlic Knot and Beer for $10.99.  Not bad at all!!

Of all the slices we ordered the plain cheese was my fave!  I just wished the garlic knot had more garlic flavor."}
{"text":"Delicious thin crust pizza in the heart of the Strip. HUGE slices!!  Open late and terrific price. You'll be hard fought to find better pizza anywhere, never at a better price, and a pretty girl with a friendly smile at the counter.   I'm from Philadelphia so I know good pizza!  Great selection of pizzas, drinks and beers. Excellent people watching while you munch."}
{"text":"Went to Vegas with my friend for a broadcasters conference. Being college students we were on a budget this place we found was heaven! It's cheap and good. Huge slice of pizza for 6 bucks. Can't beat that. The girl at the counter was really nice too."}
{"text":"Really great pizza after a night of drinking, slices bigger than your head, but still has great flavor! The knots are also very tasty and can't go wrong with the slice, knot and beer combo!"}
{"text":"Best pizza on the strip!!! Large slices - Great prices - Cold beer and Fantastic Cannoli !!!!!! TWO THUMBS UP FOR Chef Wardell Freeman!  A MUST stop on the strip."}
{"text":"This was really good pizza. The slices are huge and hot from the oven.  It is really a take away place on the strip located in front of Planet Hollywood casino. There is a place to stand inside and outside with umbrellas for shade, but no seats. If you are looking for a nice slice of pizza at a reasonable ( for the Vegas Strip) price try Pin Up Pizza."}
{"text":"This place is probably better if you're drunk. I ate here at the end of my stay when I was broke and looking for something cheap and fast on the strip. $5.65 for a piece of pizza bigger than my head? Sold! However the pizza was not now I like it. It was extremely greasy, very very thin, and crunchy. I know that's how some people like their pizza so of you do, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Very cheap and very big pizza. Low quality but for the price I still give 5 star. And actually the quality is only a tiny but better at secret pizza which is way more expensive"}
{"text":"The pizza was absolutely delicious! It was well seasoned and it truly did have an authentic New York taste!! It's well worth the money! The only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is because you cannot buy a pie. Slices only! But very much worth it!!"}
{"text":"Head sized pizza slices! The pizza is pretty good, but you would really only come here for the giant slices. Per square inch, probably the best deal on the strip."}
{"text":"The pizza is decent a little greasy for my liking but The slices are Huge and only about 7 bucks and open pretty much all day.

Minimal seating so you take it to go or eating standing up.

Servers are nice and service is quick."}
{"text":"If I could leave less stars I would, while waiting in line we watched a giant cockroach crawl around. When we said there was a huge cockroach crawling around the crew glanced at us and then ignored us. We walked out after they didn't acknowledge us and the fact that there was a huge cockroach crawling around their store. Disgusting."}
{"text":"This ain't Sbarro's.  I walked through the Sportsbook into the pizza restaurant and was initially surprised that I couldn't get a whole pizza.  Pizza here is strictly by the slice.  However, the slice is enough for two people to be happy with and two slices are about the quantity of a regular pizza.  I ordered the spinach and artichoke pizza.  The artichoke was fresh and had a nice lemony tang to it.  The spinach was ample and the two veggies complemented each other nicely.  The cheese was the right proportion to the toppings and the crust was crispy.  I am so tired of Las Vegas pizzas with the soggy crust.  So, the pizza gets reheated in the oven and is served piping hot with a crispy crust and melted cheese, right?  I needed a fork and a knife to eat this bad boy, but oh was it good.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great deal. $10 for a drink, garlic knot, and the LARGEST slice of pizza you've ever had. Great customer service. Try to get one of the few counter spots that overlooks the strip--great for people-watching as you eat."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Huge slices. NY style. Awesome deal and big selection. Friendly staff and good looking chef:) right in Planet Hollywood and accessible from the strip"}
{"text":"In and out style pizza. Ready to go, they just toss it in the pizza oven for a couple minutes. The slices are HUGE. One slice is like the size of an entire half pizza. I could not eat all of my two slices. The staff are a little dry, but I don't really blame them. It's hotter than an oven in there and people are rushing in and out. It's very cheap! Probably the cheapest food on the strip, even cheaper than White Castle, and fills you up crazy good! The pizza was  good , it's not the best pizza I've ever had but based on the size, freshness, cost and quickness I'm giving it a four star rating"}
{"text":"The cook did a beautiful job making the pizza, just watching it was dope, and the cashier was cool as hell and super nice, she even had to deal with this bitch ass customer right before us, and she still kept her cool. Great service, and my sister and I LOVE pin up, so it was perfect."}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty gross. Super spiced with pepper which was a bit too much. The pin-up girl was ridiculously mean to all of the customers. Major turn off. 2 stars is generous for this dump!"}
{"text":"LEGIT! BEST MARGHERITA PIZZA ANYWHERE! NO JOKE! I have easily eaten here at least 10 times and I don't live in Nevada. The slices are HUGE! One piece fills you up. The ladies there are super friendly. And really, take my advice and order the margherita pizza. They marinate the tomates in something so beyond tasty. The cheese is good quality whole mozarella (not the cheap shredded kind). They need to open this place up all over the US."}
{"text":"When wandering back to the hotel (PH) starving the giant pizza slices at pin up were calling us!  The line was long even though it was 3am but the service was pretty quick and we got two awesome slices....margarita slice was awesome...defiantly recommend!"}
{"text":"These slices are huge! I wish they had more selection, but it was tasty. They also have a small area to eat outside and watch people passing by on The Strip. Can't beat it for late-night pizza."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch and had a slice of margherita pizza (tomatoes and mozzarella). The pizza was Ok but not great. The slice was very large and cost $6.49. There were five different kinds of pizza. If you have the chance, Secret Pizza at the Cosmopolitan is better."}
{"text":"I had 2 slices plain cheese pizza. Very good. Not the best I've had but very good. Slices are huge as is the whole pie. Just guessing 20-22\"
Crust was crisp on bottom (as it should be) and even though the slices are large it did not sag. Sauce had a nice flavor and the cheese had just the right amount of sheen. Meaning not that orange greasy stuff flowing from some pizza I've eaten.
The garlic knots looked good but with the size of the slices I dared not try them. At least for now.
If I am in Las Vegas again I will stop by to try some of their other offerings.
Note:White pizza looked phenomenal. Posting a few photos"}
{"text":"This is the best late night pizza you can get on the strip. They are open until 4am everynight and the slices are huge!"}
{"text":"I think the pizza here isn't the greatest in terms of flavor. The value for the slice is okay as its 7 bucks for a huge slice. The crust though is too thick and a little flavorless. 

If you want an easy slice on the strip though, it's a good place. Get in and out for less than $10."}
{"text":"Holly balls this pizza is so darn good. Every time I go to vegas I have to make sure to eat at this place at least twice. The slices are bigger then big and they taste like a mythical creature. Thin crunchy crust, gooey cheese and perfectly seasoned. I can't help but \"pin-up\" my thoughts to the yelp reviews wall. A must try if your in the mood for some great pizza."}
{"text":"Coming from the new haven ct area I can say this pizza (and garlic knot) are delicious. Huge slices and nice and thin and crispy. Definitely recommend for a good slice in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Best pizzas I've ever had in my life!  Yes, I was drunk when I ordered all the different kinds of slices they had.  I didn't realize how big the slices were until I woke up in my hotel room with bite marks on all the leftover slices I fell asleep on earlier that night.  Such a Vegas thing to do.  Yes, my review is biased by my Vegas experience, but that's anticipated - alcohol makes everything better:)  Viva Pin Up Pizza!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken and spinach slice. There was a line but it moved very quickly. The staff were very friendly. The prices are great for what you get. For $7 you get a massive slice of pizza bigger than your face. It was very good pizza. There is no seating but there is a bar you can stand at. Great for take out."}
{"text":"Really great choice for a quick bite!  Had a slice of cheese pizza it was very good, very large portion too!  Just enough to share with my husband as a snack!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for a quick (or drunk) bite to eat on the strip. The slices are ginormous. I couldn't even finish the Betty P. deal of pizza, a garlic knot, and a drink, and I'm a pretty big eater. The only downside is no seating, but it's just one of those places where you go with it, prop your elbows up on the bar, and cover your face in greasy goodness. If you're staying in Planet Hollywood and don't want to venture out to find someplace to eat late, this is a good bet. 

The woman working the evening I visited was super pleasant as well and told us they get really busy after people leave the clubs. So if you're visiting late at night, expect a little bit of a wait (and probably a lot of good people watching)."}
{"text":"My gf & I found this place by accident. & what a gem we found. The pizza is ginormous! Think of 2 1/2 slices of Costco pizza for 1 slice of pin up pizza. The pizza had so much flavor & perfect amount of cheese. You get it piping hot out of the oven! My gf got the cheese & I got the ultimate meat one. The cheese was all gooey & perfect. My pizza, had real meatballs, sausage, bacon, ham & pepperoni! A lot of meat which kinda overwhelmed the pizza but high quality. We also tried the garlic knots & OMG!! Those were the best things ever! When you see then there just covered in garlic then when you order them, they put them in the oven & you get them all buttery & garlic & they put all garlic rolls to shame. The price is perfect & also great access to the sports room next door to eat while watching & betting on games"}
{"text":"Great service and combos will fill you up especially if you're a fatass like me, and if you deny you are you're in denial. ;)"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here about 3AM. The line was very long and there was quite a bit of wait. But the pizza was delicious. I appreciate they make sure your pizza is hot before serving it. We both tried a pepperoni slice and the slices are huge!!!! 2 slices were $13 and some change... Very responsible prices"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! You walk in and see beautiful tattooed women and wooly mammoth sized pizzas!!!!! They are delicious!!!! I got the spinach chicken and the crust was crunchy, amazing!!!!!! They have a small area inside to stand and eat or a small outside area to stand and eat"}
{"text":"Pizza tasted good and service was great but it gets a 1 Star because I got food poisoning.  It was absolutely horrible.  We went here around 2am, and by 9am I had diarrhea and was nauseous.  By 12pm I had abdominal cramps and I vomited before catching my flight home, and vomited again after the flight.  Finally eldest better by morning.  If you're going to still eat there after reading this, then I suggest not getting the chicken and spinach pizza which is what I had.  Everyone else in my party got something different and they didn't get sick."}
{"text":"Bigger is not always better

The pizzas are huge They taste OK but Secret Pizza still taste a lot better. If you;re looking for inexpensive and fulfilling meal at the strip late night, this will be your place. Otherwise Secret pizza at Cosmo will be a better choice"}
{"text":"This is one of the best late night snack in the area. Then the next afternoon it was even better as we planned a later dinner.
  It's got a good take on a margarita pizza. Definitely worth every penny."}
{"text":"The food as well as the service was incredible! Great prices and giant slices of pizza make for a great meal on the LV Strip!"}
{"text":"The margherita was bland and flavorless. Aside from the scattered pieces of cheese it tasted like just bread. The portion is a big slice for like &6.50. Im sure the pepperoni would've been better! Located right next to Pinks hot dogs"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Town!  My husband and I come every year to Vegas, primarily for the SEMA show.  Pin Up Pizza is located directly outside Planet Hollywood on the strip and it's the best! There are so many options and it's also family owned!"}
{"text":"They use The best flour there is for pizza...... \"Antimo Caputo 00\" ..... Fantastic pizza....."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok...good spot for a quick bite but definitely not a pizza to brag about...service was a lil poor...ordered a pizza and a pop, she coulda said get the chips and save a couple bucks but didn't

Secret pizza at cosmos a bit better--my opinion"}
{"text":"Be prepared to make at least 20 minutes of line, 2 combos offered, the difference is the drink(soda or beer). 
I'm pretty positive that what it sells there is just the presentation of the pizza, because on terms of taste there's way more better pizza out there. So if you want to fill up your IG's with a giant pizza... this is a good place. 

Forgot to mention that the knots are way better tasty than the pizza

Will try it again, depending on the waiting line of course."}
{"text":"Huge pieces of pizza that will satisfy your cravings drunk or otherwise. Connected to planet Hollywood's sports book and access from Las Vegas Blvd. Slices are less than $7."}
{"text":"Definitely a tourist place. Longest line I've been in yet. About 30 minutes with 20 or so people in front of me. They heat up the pizza and garlic knot as you order. 
The slice is big, but it doesn't have anything on Momo's in Tallahassee, FL. 
The pizza is good - not bad and not great. Just average. The garlic knot is sub par - needs more garlic, though props to not being burnt or over cooked dough. 
$11.10 - slice of pizza, soda, and garlic knot, including tax."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza!!! Big and delicious!!! *-* Just the cashier is a little bit rude... Maybe she was in a bad day."}
{"text":"Decent customer service,  fun theme.   The slice is huge and the flavors are good.   The pizza sits under a lamp before reheating."}
{"text":"The pizza was ok. The service was what gets the one star.  The lady at the counter laughed at my wife's accent, unacceptable.  I hope management talks to her about her behavior.

Don't forget that asking for a simple cup of water will add one dollar to your bill. 

Not worth the hassle for a dump without tables or chairs. Just save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"After coming there about 3 times a week on my  lunch, I have experienced that they are always late to open by about an hour. Today I walked up to the entrance to be welcomed by a man who very rudely blocked the entrance and yelled \"were not open! Wait 20 mins\" and ran back inside. It's 1pm in the afternoon. Sucks for them losing business all day. I am a repeating customer who loves their pizza. After being yelled at and walking ten mins there on my lunch, I will definitely question if it's worth the walk and wait."}
{"text":"Pizza at this place is DELICIOUS. One slice is all you need and I'm a 2-3 slice kinda girl. It's right next to Pink's hot dogs. No outdoor seating, but pizza makes up for it."}
{"text":"Pizza was damn good. When baked again prior to serving, that thing came back to life. Tasty, quick, and it's in vegas. What more can i say."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza on the Vegas strip! Located in on the front of Planet Hollywood, they serve authentic New York style pizza. 

The pizza is already made, so you can get a slice really fast as soon as they heat it up in the oven. The slices are enormous, so one slice will probably do.

I had the sausage pepperoni pizza. It had two types of sausage and giant pepperoni's. The pizza was extremely crispy and tasty. 

I highly recommend this place. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This was  Disappointing. It was just as good as a borrows in a mall. I was expecting a lot more with the reviews given here. If you want just average pizza then go ahead if not then suggest to think twice. We had lunch here and near by places would have been better."}
{"text":"Pizza is ok, nothing special and service is ok. Great location and easy to get to as right in planet Hollywood.  Disappointed as tried the pizza in Laughlin and it was much better and not loaded with garlic in the sauce.  Not sure how you can run out of boxes for the pizza especially when people are ordering 4 and 5 pieces of pizza and have to carry them out on paper plates back to the hotel."}
{"text":"The pizza was ok, nothing really special about it beside it being as large as your face. Very plain. Pizza dough, sauce, cheese, pepperoni. They ask you for your selection then they warm it up for you in the oven. Very friendly staff. Cool to see the chef kneading the dough and making the pizza right there behind the glass. Kind of on the pricey side for one slice ($7) I went because I saw a video on Facebook and it was conveniently located in the same building as my hotel. They have a standing section that you can set your pizza down at and stand and eat. Good stop for a quick bite to eat after the bars. They close at 4 am."}
{"text":"Pin-Up Pizza is known for their huge slices that a regular paper plate isn't big enough to hold. The line up was out the door when we arrived at around 10:30 PM. They had seven kinds to choose from but not all were available when we were there. I was actually looking forward to trying the prosciutto and arugula, but they didn't have it, so I settled for the chicken and spinach. It was very busy but yet the server kept her cool. Service was super fast, so don't expect too much. The shop had an outdoor area for patrons but it was really messy: empty beer bottles, leftover crusts, dirty napkins, etc. 

I liked how the crust was not too thick. I would say I had a generous amount of chicken and spinach on my pizza. However, I thought the flavour was lacking overall. It was only flavourful where the chicken and spinach was, so in other areas, it was bland. For $7 USD, I though it was a little expensive when I converted back to canadian, which was about 9 bucks. Was this pizza really worth $9 bucks? I didn't think so. But at that time of the night, it was a good alternative to burgers and fries."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!  The nachos & drinks were SO good. I am definitely eating here again when I come back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed.. I saw that they had 4 stars & we walked pretty far to get here for this? One reason I chose it was because they sell by the slice & since I can be indecisive I like to get 2 different slices, so..
1) they didn't have much variety at all
2) not many specialty pieces- very basic
3) the margerita shouldn't even be called margerita, they made it their own way with grape tomatoes, no basil, no tomato sauce
4) my husband got a sausage, ricotta piece & there was so little ricotta

I highly recommend the pizza place in the New York hotel, the one on the second floor..or 800 degrees! Both delicious!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was very good ! But service was horrible ! The girl who was behind the counter was very rude , her name was Stacy. She had an attitude the whole time we were trying to order. Even after we left you could hear her talking to other customers about us complaining. As our first time in Vegas we were excited to try out pin up pizza but after getting such rude service from Stacy the only thing we looked forward to was getting out of there. Management needs to do a better job of making sure their employees are respectful and nice to every single guest."}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty good and really large, especially for a late night spot. The garlic knots are really what you should be aiming for, theyre soft and flavorful and really worth it. I got the combo for $9-10 which is just the right amount for one person and relatively cheap considering the area. The service is quick and awesome here, try it!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a massive cheese slice from here for $6.  The pizza has a thin crust and it was decent.  

There's no seating options in here but there's a counter looking out onto the strip or head over to the sports book to catch a game.  The sports book option is awesome!  Large slice, drink and multiple sports games on!"}
{"text":"Husband and I looked forward to trying this place after watching it on food network.
Good pizza BUT......Poor girl was not attentive to our order at all. We clearly said 2 slices 2 sodas, one meat one chicken spinach. But she only put one in the oven to heat up, leaving my husband standing there watching like wth lady! Where's the pizza?! Maybe she was distracted by my handsome hunk of a husband... I know girl, his sexiness has that effect. Pizza was delicious but the service was meh.
#StayFocusBoo"}
{"text":"The pizza was decent. Good price for the size but the reason this only gets 3 stars is for the girls working there. They don't look too happy to be there and one Hispanic girl was very rude. Probably won't go back just because of the bad attitude of the staff."}
{"text":"This review is kind of all over the place, but this is pretty much exactly what happened.

I went to this pizza establishment around 3am August 14, 2016. I went with about 8 people including myself. There were only about 10 people ahead of us when we got there.

I waited in line with about 5 of my friends in front of me.

I get to the register and I state that I wanted to order a slice of cheese and one garlic knot. The girl at the cash register states to me that I have to wait in line before I order... What!? I waited in line for like 5 minutes. She said that I wasn't in line.

After I tell her that I waited in line just like everyone else, she says that I was supposed to put in my order with the other guy. There is a guy cooking the pizzas and pulling them out of the oven. I guess he goes down the line and asks what people want to order. 

Well he states that he never saw me in line. I laughed! I am 6'4\" and you didn't see me? Come on now. I was literally the biggest person in there...LITERALLY!

After I said that, the girl told me that she would give me what I wanted to order for free. I turned it down...really didn't want a slice of pizza that I'm pretty sure would of gotten spit on.

The guy behind the counter gets mad because I said one cuss word in there. I apologized for saying it..but then he gets loud and says \"I have the right to refuse service to you!!!\"  

I laughed and yelled back to him...\"DOG! You already refused service to me..what's next!?\" 

The girl behind laughed and said, \"touché, touché...\""}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place and it was so worth it amazing Pizza only downfall is the line but it was worth it so yummy and so big definitely recommended"}
{"text":"Was  cool until they didn't sever the people in the line when the closed I thought they was going but guess not and the whole nonchalant attitude made it worse don't eat here"}
{"text":"These slices are huge! Perfect if you're hungry and aching to get back to the debauchery that is Las Vegas! For less than $10 you can get a Sandra Dee combo with a huge slice, garlic knot, and a soft drink. Or grab a Betty P combo with a beer instead of a soda.
Overall you can't go wrong. They have different slices to choose from: all meats, veggies, Margherita (the best - marinated tomatoes, basil, delicious) and more! Seems that everything is made fresh. You can see the cooks at work kneeding and flipping the dough!
You have to check out PinUp!"}
{"text":"We always pass by Pin Up Pizza when we are walking around the strip, but never really stopped by. We were craving some 'good' pizza and decided to stop in to try a slice or two. Their pizza portion is HUGE even for just one slice. We decided to get two kinds when we saw their menu. One was the chicken & spinach and the other one was the Salami Trio. To be honest, their Salami one was nothing special. All I can remember from it was that it was salty. The chicken and spinach pizza was really good, however. Not too salty and not too creamy. I would come back for that slice! You can get it to go or eat at the shop, but the shop isn't very big at all. They warm it up for you right after you order so it's nice and piping hot! However, the only thing I could think that I didn't like was that they didn't have any cheese/pepper for to-go."}
{"text":"At the strip by Planet Hollywood. The biggest slice of pizza.  Ordered Bettie P combo (a slice of meat pizza, garlic knot and a bottle of Corona). That's LV strip experience."}
{"text":"I'm from New York where we have the best pizza in town. I came here and did not expect to like this slice as much as I did! It was huge and amazing!!! Had a slice with the garlic knot and I was yearning for more! Definitely recommend this place !!!"}
{"text":"Everything looks better than it appears.  Just my opinion.  I had the meat slice with the garlic knot.  It was pretty dry.  They don't give you anything to dip for the knot either.  The girl behind the counter was quick, but not friendly at all.  Really no customer service, just service if you know what I mean. 

The nice thing here is you can take the pizza straight into the sports book and watch the races and games."}
{"text":"Pizza isn't bad but they could be friendlier. Also it would be nice to know that ranch is additional when you pay-it is inconvenient to pay extra what you use credit. Service was okay."}
{"text":"Wow. I'm here in Sin City too much (working) and even though there are great restaurants it's hard to find a fast and tasty spot. Pin Up Pizza is delicious, fast, convenient, and a good value. While Secret Pizza (Cosmo) and Pop Up (MGM) are good this place is a solid 1 star above.  One slice will easily satisfy you for lunch or a quick dinner. Entrance off the strip or from the PH sports book. Do yourself a favor and stop by next time your in town, this place will definitely steal some of the Earl of Sandwich crowd (and that is very hard to do)."}
{"text":"Right on the strip, across from the Cosmopolitan. This tiny place is easy to miss among all the lights but once you try their pizza, you will definitely come back. Their menu is very simple making to easy to chose and reducing the waiting time. They also serve to largest slice of pizza I have seen, with a nice crust and enough to fill you up (but it should not stop you from getting seconds). The name is not for nothing either, with most of the girls are actually in pin-up outfit and make-up. So busy the pizzas are continuously made just a few feet from your nose! Only thing is the lack of seating, except for a tiny stand up only area right outside the place, but at least with a nice view of the busy crowd...."}
{"text":"The cashier was such a nice lady! Showing us the options and giving feedback! Love the way the dressed and moved the line quick! We are outside and people watched while we stuffed our face and caught Pokemon haha the pizza slice was bigger than my arm it's crazy! Very satisfying!"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is value. I could not believe the price for a slice of pizza....given the huge size of their slices. Absolutely amazing.  The pizza tasted good and is on part with many of the pizza offerings on the strip. We did go later in the evening and found the crust to be somewhat hard, leaving the roof of mouth a little worse for wear. Other than that I give this place a thumbs up. Give it a try. It was fast and the staff was friendly."}
{"text":"if i could leave zero stars i would! 

1. pizza was pulled out early and was cold

2.cold pizza was left out in front of other customers to breath on

3.cashier lady was rude as hell and had a problem when i asked for no ice! was it that bad?!

4. overpriced 

take your business elsewhere, people!"}
{"text":"Beautiful crust and fast service! My bf and I ate a slice and a knot for a light dinner under $7!"}
{"text":"Seen it on a Facebook video and had to try it. Not expensive, they have good combo deals (slice, garlic knot, beer or soda) and it's pretty cool to see them tossin the dough. Only part that would
Make this a 5 star review is if they had garlic knots!! I had my heart set on them lol. But they are high in demand which isn't a bad thing I suppose! I had chicken and spinach, my husband had big meats and both were amazzzzing! Wait time wasn't bad, I mean you're on the strip with a bunch of hungry intoxicated folks you're gonna wait for stuff lol. We were in line maybe 10 min!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good. The slices are large and come from a   30\" pizza.  This place is open til 4am while most places are close. Great for the person with a case if the munchies. They only got stand up areas with counters. Look forward to eating here agian if the opportunity presents itself."}
{"text":"Really big slices off PIzza for only 5-6 bucks. Mine was pretty salty tasting but still really good.  

Lots of selections, I had sausage my girlfriend had artichoke. Both were good!!"}
{"text":"The pizza slices were definitely not as big as the BuzzFeed video implied, but the quality of the pizza was AMAZING. the prosciutto pizza and chicken pizzas were the best."}
{"text":"This is a great option for a quick slice when you're on the strip and want something inexpensive. I had the cheese and the chicken and spinach pizza. It's a walk up place with limited seating but they let people go in a comfortably sit in the sports book. The people behind the counter were efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"HUGE slices, so be hungry. Good deal- you can get a slice, a garlic knot, and a beer for 10.99! Or with a soda for like 8.99! That is cheap for Vegas and by the end of it fully satisfied. Good pizza, I've had better but still very good. Garlic knots are the bomb. Small business so expect lines, boo hoo you have to wait, it's Vegas, stop complaining and enjoy the ride."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick hot slice of pizza out on a cool brisk night on the strip.  I wanted to give it a try since there was no line, and it was a quick easy bite to have before going out for a long night on the strip.  Ordered the pepperoni slice which was served warm and definitely one thing this place has down is the size of the pizza.  Pizza slices served are enormous here and the pepperoni has an awesome spice to it.  But the rest of the pizza itself... the thin crust, the cheese is nothing out of this world... overall I'd say it's average pizza.  There may be better pizza shops around in the area, but if you're looking for a quick bite this place is right smack middle in the strip and you can't miss it! I might of enjoyed it more after a long late night of drinks and partying... can definitely see this place being the perfect spot to sober up late nights!"}
{"text":"Loved this pizza!! I had just a regular slice of pepperoni but it was so good!! The garlic knots were the best I have had! They were soft & buttery. The customer service could be a little better though!"}
{"text":"They have great pizza!
But we showed up at 3:50am and they were supposed to close at 4.

Please stick to your hours of operation.  Thank you."}
{"text":"I went to see Britney and got in line very early in the afternoon, so when the show ended I was starving.  This place saved my life with a huge (and good) slice of pepperoni."}
{"text":"In Vegas for Labor Day Weekend and decided to try Pin Up Pizza since I've heard so much about it. They have a cool little location at Planet Hollywood. I have to say that it's one of the best pizza places I've had and would definitely be going back for some more."}
{"text":"I feel betrayed and cannot trust yelp anymore. There was nothing to write home about this joint. Went there around 2 am. Seemed busy. But the pizzas was disappointing. There was barely sauce or meat on it. Lacked of flavors. They looked sad on the countertop. Overall, a overrated joint. I'm guessing those 5 star reviews are from drunk people or people who eat mac n cheese with ranch."}
{"text":"Awesome size slices. Good flavor and great especially for late night eating!  Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"This place is seriously a hidden gem in northern Chicago. Very inexpensive for some of the best pastries that I have ever tasted. If you are ever out in this area, do your taste buds a favor and stop in!"}
{"text":"On our way back to our hotel on the strip we wanted a good slice of pizza so we stopped here and not was it good. I ordered a slice of margarita pizza. It didnt cost too much and the slice was huge. The pizza had great topping and good quality. I loved that there wasn't any sauce on the margarita pizza but they used oil and herbs which paired well with the thin, crispy crust that was soft in all the right places. I would definitely recommend and will likely go back before I return back to Texas."}
{"text":"Huge portions! New York style pizza extra crispy not too greasy and delicious toppings. Only disappointment was the lack of toppings on my sausage slice. For the price they should make sure the entire slice is covered!"}
{"text":"Really wasn't impressed.

The pizza slices are huge, and decent. The garlic knots are also decent.

But nothing \"amazing\". Just decent pizza in an enormous slice.

There's no places to sit. The best part is the rockabilly music playing. But aside from that, there's not much pin-up action going on. Having photos of Katy Perry (beautiful girl but...) isn't what most peoples definition of a pin-up model are. I also expected the people working there to be in a rockabilly/greaser get up, but to no avail.

I wouldn't go there again, but I guess it's worth a 1 time experience.

I just expected a LOT more for Pin-Up Pizza and all the good reviews. My girlfriend, being highly influenced by pin-up and alternative style, and being from New York, and loving thin crust (I like thicker, and deep dish, but good pizza is good pizza)... She was also as disappointed as I was."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza... especially after a night of drinking! Much better than Sbarro's out in the mall."}
{"text":"Late night snacks are the best especially in the form of pizza! My boyfriend recommended this pizza place and there was a long line, but it ended up being so delicious. They are only half cooked so that when warmed up they are cooked perfectly which is a great technique. Oddly, I asked them not to warm up the pizza (which they advised against) but it was still very good! Great sauce flavor, nice big slice, and non-rubbery cheese - I don't know if I'd go again late at night just because the line was so long, but definitely would visit again during the day or another time to avoid the rush!"}
{"text":"Yummy pizza with a kick butt location. Pin Up Pizza is located outside Planet Hollywood or inside if you go through the sportsbook. My husband and I sat in the sportsbook for sometime watching the NBA playoffs and we smelled delicious pizza all day long so naturally we had to grab a slice. We got the meatball pizza which was tasty however I tend to like more sauce on my pizza. Thin crust, the right amount of cheese, and huge meatballs tasted good. I hardly tasted the sauce. I loved that this pizza did not give me heartburn. Many times pizza will give me heartburn because of the acidic sauce. Not this pizza. They have a variety of pizza's as well as garlic knots, and cannolis. A slice of meatball pizza was $6.50. You can get a slice of pizza, a garlic knot, and a beer for 10.99. This is a grab and go style eatery. There are places to stand outside and eat your pizza with a high top counter but there is nowhere to sit."}
{"text":"We ordered 2 slices (chicken & spinach, big meat) and 4 garlic knots. They were huge slices of pizza for $6.75 each. But that's pretty much it. They didn't seem to have much flavor and barely had any sauce. It's ok if you are starving and looking for a pretty cheap quick bite."}
{"text":"This is a novelty place. The servers look like typical pin up girls and the slices are HUGE! The pepperoni was too spicy for my liking. I probably would have enjoyed cheese better. It's a great value for the size of slice you get and it's a cool atmosphere. They stay pretty busy and fill up quickly so you likely have to sit or stand outside."}
{"text":"Delicious huge slices for affordable prices, the combo is a great deal. Very friendly service too."}
{"text":"Pluses
1.Location is good
2. Price is not bad considering location
Minuses
1. No place to sit
2. Pizza is just MEDIOCRE"}
{"text":"This place is hitting the jackpot. Tiny, packed, dirt cheap and good. You can see the guy making the pies right in front of you. Margherita? How ever you spell it was on point. Super super fresh. The slices are HUGE. This place is open til 4am and is perfect to combat the drinks you may or may not have had.  I will most definitely go back here when looking for a quick food fix. The small and extremely busy staff were also nice and took their time with each customer. Yay me for finding this place."}
{"text":"The must try is the pizza, knot and soda deal with tax it's about 10 bucks but it is worth the money!! The knot is perfectly seasoned and baked to perfection! The pizza is huge and 2 people could eat off this one slice. The staff are dressed so classy and put you in the mind of the pin up models hence the name. You select your pizza from the ones on display and they put them in their huge stove so you can actually see what your going to get before you order. We got the pepparoni, salami, peppercheni one it was amaizing! It does not take too long to get your food, my only complaint is there is really no room to eat your pizza there we had to go next door to the pinks hotdog place to sit and eat. The one thing i enjoy about some of the places on the strip is you can people watch as you eat your food, there are some interesting people who walk the strip...lol"}
{"text":"Fast and extremely friendly service, and a nice selection of pie choices. My only complaint might be that there is not a veggie option. Ordered a cheese slice, came out fairly fast but hotter than crap (burned my tongue on the first bite). Red sauce yummy, crust pretty good too. I liked that they did not put too much cheese on the pizza, just right for me. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Eva from Pin Up Pizza was so friendly, one of the nicest people I met while on vacation. Pin Up was recommended to us by a woman on the street eating a slice. Asked how it was and she said \"It's ******* awesome! Eat there!\"

Great recommendation. Delicious pizza."}
{"text":"So cheap, so good! Located near the High Roller, you can enjoy your pizza outside near the beautiful water fountain! I was apprehensive at first because it appeared the pizza was sitting out. However, they cook it upon order and it is fabulous!"}
{"text":"really large pizza slices for $7. we got their pig pizza which included pepperoni and ham over cheese. one bite and i wasn't a fan - the pizza reminds me of a less greasy pizza hut. the crust is regular size ( not thin crust ), really chewy and doughy. i couldn't get over the fact that they didn't dress the pizza with pizza / tomato sauce -- so eating it felt like i was stuffing my face with bland carbs. bleh, no bueno."}
{"text":"Monstrous slices of pizza!!! Good pizza and yummy garlic knots. My only con is that the pizza is already made and than they just warm it up. I get that it would take a while for them to make one slice of pizza at a time but the portions are massive. My son who is the pickiest eater of all time was able to eat most of it which surprised the heck out of me. He really enjoyed it! 
We got a few slices of pizza and we all enjoyed it. They also have combo prices too or single slices. The garlic knot is an absolute must to try especially if you like garlic.

Service was good and it's stand up seating, it's more of a quick bite and go or just grab and go.

All in all a good spot for good pizza!"}
{"text":"Thought this was the best pizza on the strip until i went across the street to the cosmo"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza spot in Vegas...was my recent visit and my visit last year and although NYC has the best pizza in the world Pin-Up Pizza comes kind of close. Huge flavorful slices with a variety of toppings. If you are taking a slice to go they put it in a cool pizza shaped slice box. Good service as well and decent inexpensive sides like garlic knots, which really came in clutch my first night here my recent visit. Definitely will always make a stop here anytime I come through to Vegas."}
{"text":"Love it.  Went for the first time. Slices are huge and the combos are perfect.  Lacking in variety but great traditional flavored.  There are three great New York style pizza places in the heart of the strip.  This one is tied for second best but still great."}
{"text":"Sorry, I prefer Secret Pizza. I like how Pin Up has some more unique pies available without requiring a special order (chicken and spinach, potato-prosciutto-mushroom), and the slices are huge enough to feed two, and make a cheap Strip meal... but the product itself just isn't something I'd come back for. Pizza slice didn't have much flavor in the toppings or crust, maybe I'd have better luck sticking to the classic pepperoni?

 I also disliked that the base of the pie was covered in tons of little crumbs that looked like pepper(?) and made a huge mess on my hands as I ate. Grab napkins if you take your order to go. Counter staff were dressed in keeping with the pin up theme, but the cold, unfriendly attitude was something I could do without. 

TIP:  I think the only way to get to it is from the exterior along the Strip. Get here from Planet Hollywood parking garage by taking the Miracle Mile shops to the right, follow signage to exit for the Strip, and take an immediate right."}
{"text":"The service was awesome. Came there hungry and asked for a whole pizza. They usually dont make em during the early morning hours around 2am but they hooked it up this time. And dayummmm that pizza was fiyahh. One slice would have made anybody full but i was so hungry i had to eat 2 slices. It was quite a walk from the joint back to the hotel and along the way people were tryin to buy a slice for 10 bucks each. I would have sold it had i bought 2 whole pizzas but nah i had hungry ppl back at the hotel room. 

Oh yea another thing thats a must grab to die for is their garlic knot. U wont be able to go wrong with that.
Late night muchies, i suggest pin up pizzas!"}
{"text":"Would be an enjoyable experience for most. Pin Up makes the biggest pizzas you can buy in Las Vegas. There's very long lines at peak hours. and the one server at the time was also taking payments. She seemed tired.

The food tasted good altogether and the price is right. For the novelty of a giant pizza, you're doing good going here."}
{"text":"Small pizza store right on the walkways of the strip.  Good spot to get a HUGE slice of pizza and awesome garlic knots!  

Only downside is no sitting, just a small outside area of counter high edge tables and also along the inside.  

Pizza's were simple to choose from which is great since you can't get too overwhelmed and they reheat them up for you.  I like thin crust pizza's so was happy to try this place out."}
{"text":"During my Little League career I picked up a serious vice. My easily influenced ten-year-old self watched MLB players chomp on chewing tobacco and followed suit by developing a habit for Big League Chew. Bubble gum shredded into strips in a baseball-themed pouch meant to resemble their 18+ counterparts. It would barely last an inning and you'd spend most of it spitting out hot-pink syrup like you'd taken a big bite of flamingo you suddenly regretted. That's kinda what it's like to eat at Pin-up Pizza. 

It's called Pin-Up because it tastes like someone nailed your slice to a wall for a calendar year with each topping representing a federal holiday or important birthday. The flavor dissipates almost instantly and you spend the rest of your time chewing on a flavorless mass like an astronaut with a freeze-dried bagel. Paper-thin, minimal amount of sauce and a skinny layer of cheese seemingly limited by a dairy accountant.

The price isn't right. A cheese slice, even in New York, has a ceiling of $2. So why everyone boasts that the softball-sized garlic knots are $3 and the HUGE slices are only $6 is beyond me. Asteroids are HUGE too but I'd rather have my dinosaurs back. 

The grandiose nature of Vegas peppers the strip with celebrity-themed establishments like Gordon Ramsay's BurGR and Tila Tequila's Stroke Shack that require long waits and little value. It's actually cheaper to buy a 64oz frozen Long Island complete with souvenir \"High Roller\" pimp cup than a nutritious meal on the strip. Which is probably why the South Side of Las Vegas Blvd is a belligerent stampede of prostitutes and panhandlers mixed with the tourists that support them. Be prepared to see more meat hanging off the patrons than the pies, especially late night.

Pin-up at least offers quick, simple and economical (for Vegas) fuel for your gambling fever. Plus there's a certain kitschiness to a larger than life meal you could wrap around your neck like a scarf. Everyone else should head to do-it-yourself Project Pie at the MGM Grand, at least if your creation crashes you only have yourself to blame."}
{"text":"First off, it was ridiculously slow! It took 25 min to get through a line of 7 people when all they are doing is heating up slices of pizza in the oven for a minute. Then we finally get our pizza and it was so salty that my friend and I ended up eating the crust and throwing the rest of it away. It was an unfortunate waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Certainly THE BEST PIZZA IVE EVER TASTED! 
The consistency of the bread and the toppings are just crazy good. They have an option to put some cherry tomatoes and some greens @ a black sauce...it's just delightful!  can't wait to try it again 

*The cashier didn't have the best service, but I understand...it was 12am, and she was probably tired. *"}
{"text":"Hankering for a quick hearty feed near Planet Hollywood? This is just the place! Due to good turnover, the slices are fresh and they'll throw it in the oven to quickly warm the slices up as you order. You can watch the guys stretch and work the dough for the next 30 inch pizza they're cooking.

if you like a bit of heat then you'll appreciate the chilli powder and Sriracha sauce available on the bench tops.

Popular with those after a quick feed or the post boozy late night meal - I think this slice joint will be around to stay."}
{"text":"Good pizza..bad attitude..this is Vegas..if your in a bad mood to be working the register..go home..if i wanted to deal with someone acting like they are doing me a favor  than i would of stayed home.  Remember people come to Vegas to get away from reality. .its ok to fake a smile register girl...we all do it in the real world. ."}
{"text":"The slices are huge! My husband and our wedding party got them and brought them back to our room while I got my hair done. It was the perfect meal on the run while getting ready.  We meant to get back over there but never did.  Hubby still talks about it. I got veggie, he got all meat.  I think it was a good value."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok but the service was awful. The person behind me asked it they could cut the piece in two and they said no they are too busy. I bought a garlic knot along with my pizza and wanted to buy the extra sauce that is on the menu for .75 to dip my knot in. The lady told me that they are out of sauce. I said I have sauce on my pizza but she said they don't have any. I told her I did not want the knot and she said they already made it and it's good without the sauce. I have had better pizza at every pizza place i have eaten in vegas. Also if you want to sit down to eat don't go here."}
{"text":"This is by far NOT the best pizza I have ever had.  Here is why this place gets 5 stars:
1. It is open until 4 am on the Vegas Strip
2. Every slice I have had (I went there about 4 - 5 times during my drinking bender) was amazing (sober or drunk)
3. The slices are huge and 1 should be able to fill up any normal person.  I am not normal so I always get two.

The cheese is fresh, as you can tell by the amazing amount of grease the rolls off the slices as you fold them in half.  They have red pepper, Siracha and other condiments for your pizza eating joy.  And did I mention they were open until 4am?  Find another place that you can get for ~$10, get a great piece of chow, and be on your way in minutes at 3 AM on the strip without having to drive?  There is Denny's but seriously?  After drinking, Denny's is sobering up, at 3 am in Vegas I want to keep it going - so this works great.

You won't be upset if you try it.  The women even dress up in corsets which is funny."}
{"text":"Place is okay at best...to actually enjoy what you're eating I'd recommend getting drunk or close first. Place is overhyped and disappointing. Slices are big...Can't deny them that."}
{"text":"Who craves pizza when they're in vegas? I do. I got tired of buffets & other usual eats so I started searching up pizza places. The pictures alone caught my attention because of how big the slices are!

Its right in front of Planet Hollywood, right next to Pink's Hotdogs. Its a cute little spot - not much room to eat in or outside but I do believe theres an actual restaurant of some sort inside? With a bigger menu or so?

Anywho - I forgot what my combo was called but it was a slice of pizza, a garlic knot & a drink for about $7. Not bad.

The pizza was pretty good. ITS SO BIG. (Thats what she said, HAHA) Definitely coming back here. The garlic knots were so good."}
{"text":"We came here on our way out of the casino at 2 in the morning and grabbed the last slice of the day! We had the meaty pizza (not sure what it is) but it was so delicious and fed 2 of us for our walk back to the hotel. Maybe it was the beer we were drinking, but it really hit the spot for some good pizza. Staff was very friendly for us coming so late too which was a definite plus!"}
{"text":"Awesome stop if you are near PH. Huge slices of pizza and cool staff.  Get that late night slice here!  Love the garlic and taste even on a plain cheese.  Nice crispy crust too!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place and I was disappointed. Ok pizza slice is huge, but the taste meh, I've had better . Would I go again, definitely not."}
{"text":"Quick lunch here while in Vegas and it was a great choice!  The slice of pizza was HUGE and yummy!  You can't beat the price!"}
{"text":"Pin Up Pizza was the first pizza we had when we first came to Vegas! It is one of the most affordables at about $6 for a huge slice they put in a box..Which you can share if you like...Because of the affordability...We had them more than once...I would suggest you buy drinks off the strip and keep them in a cooler...Unless you don't mind shelling out $3 per small cup of soda! The location is also great...Right in the middle of the Strip! Great location to people watch...I do not suggest this pizza for people who are looking for healthy! This is more for the hungry...Who want to save money on the Strip.*"}
{"text":"Horrible service from a lady with tatoos, aggresive and discriminating customers along the line, felt harrased   super rude and 0 customer service from lady with tatoos. Wont come back to this place unless custome service changes."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a Slice of pizza.. Great flavor! The girl behind counter was friendly!
We will def be back !"}
{"text":"Good pizza only tried cheese pizza was pretty good not bad. The only thing about this place they really don't have a seating arrangement or a place to really sit and enjoy ur slice or pizza. And the place gets really crowded at times that it's a bit hard to walk in and the line goes out the door at times."}
{"text":"Idk if my expectations were too high, but the pizza was basic thin style new york. Pizza options pre made-no alterations allowed. $75.00 for the whole pie (it is enormously big) $10.25 for one slice, garlic roll and soda-which is great. However there is absolutely no sitting area to sit, no stools-nothing. Only a bar counter where they placed the peppers flakes and parmesan cheese, and the counter was comfortably only fit a total of 6 people (3 on each side) So if u walked around all day and expect to sit and eat-do not count on it."}
{"text":"Pin up pizza had great portion sizes for the price they asked for, but the pizza was just another interpretation of a cliche dish. Pin up pizza didn't have anything that would make you say \"this is from pin up pizza.\" Just another quick spot to hit up on the strip when you want a quick bite."}
{"text":"Location is ok for the strip. One of the Chicks who takes orders doesn't seem like she likes her job very much. Who can blame her, she works on the strip. But it's cool- Thanks for the \"free\" ranch when I offered to pay for it even before you told me \"WE CHARGE FOR IT, BUT HERE YOU GO\"...... Pizzas are huge slices. Ok for on-the-go grub pizza. Get the combo, it's a deal."}
{"text":"Garlic knots and pepperoni pizza are amazing. No need to make the trek to Secret Pizza if you're staying at PH or Elara."}
{"text":"We ate here yesterday and the pizza was great!  Thank you Wendell for responding!"}
{"text":"This place is Great, Pizza has great flavor they just need to stay open later! It is Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Nice pizza joint place on the Vegas Strip. Thin crust pizza new york style. Bit over priced, but great taste. Their slices are huge thought. Love the concept!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok pizza. gets the job done when you are hungry and drunk. 
slices here are huge. One slice should definitely fill you up

Check in on Yelp and get a free.bottle of Miller beer for free!"}
{"text":"Meh. Not for $7 sorry. 

The pizza slice was huge, I'll give you that. 

The pizza itself was average, a little better than dominos. 

The garlic knot was a disappointment. 

I wouldn't come back, there is better pizza around town."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza!! We got the combo huge slice a garlic knot and drink for about $10 not bad and it was good my husband went for seconds. It's right on the strip there's nowhere to sit just to stand but it's so good u will be back"}
{"text":"Great pizza., large too for that one slice.  Very fulfilling.   I had the pepperoni .  Staff very friendly."}
{"text":"Really good New York style pizza. A buddy and I both ate there for under 20 bucks with a drink.  A must. Right next to planet Hollywood."}
{"text":"Not a bad choice for a late night meal. Nothing beats some pizza after drinking all night. Slices are large and you can get a garlic roll,slice and drink for $10. Check it out if you are on the strip near planet Hollywood."}
{"text":"This was AMAZING pizza. The slices were huge! I definitely recommend making the stop if you're on the strip. It's on the opposite side of The Cosmopolitan. The line wait wasn't extensive and the pizza is thin crust and so tasty! Not to mention the cute decor! A must when you're drunk and looking for good pizza on the strip!"}
{"text":"I saw this place on the insider goods on my FB and got very excited. Let me tell you that it's just OK. Yes the slices are huge, but the taste, not so much. Waited in lime for 30 minutes and the o my thing that really had me in \"awe\" were their garlic knots! So delicious. Had the pepperoni pizza and meat lovers. Was just ok. Was disappoint to see that it was just reheated in the over pizza. When I saw that, I knew it wouldn't be much. I was right. This is a spot where you can say u ate it, but won't go out of your way to come again."}
{"text":"Oh yeah! The best pizza around, next to Planet Hollywood. Hand tossed dough, excellent crust, awesome fresh ingredients. A must try for that late night snack. $10 gets you a large slice of pie, a garlic roll and a soft drink"}
{"text":"It's a good spot for the late night meals but be warned you may not get the warmest greeting. They also don't have to go boxes if you are trying to take your pizza back to your room. The cashier was also rude so keep what you ask for at a minimum or she will start rolling her eyes. The pizza wasn't even that good so it was a waste if time the only thing i give this place is how big the slices were. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"The best pizza this Sicilian has had - ever. We loved it so much we've been here 3 times in the last 36 hours. I joined Yelp just to review this place, honestly. 

What we got: margarita, spinach & artichoke, sausage 

Only down sides: 1) No place to sit in or out, 2) Pepsi products."}
{"text":"I love pizza but this pizza was so damn bomb! It was worth the wait and the price. Delicious pizza glad I stopped and grabbed a slice."}
{"text":"The pizza was good not the best but good. Line was long. Waitress at the end was mad we didn't tip and said \"you should tell them don't be afraid to tip\" won't be going back for that reason."}
{"text":"We go here every time we're in Vegas. Can be a hit or miss depending on who's making the pizza that day.  One day it's delicious & the next they're leaving it in the oven too long. The slices are huge I think you get your money's worth."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. I've been here 3 times now, I almost went for a 4th time! (Twice in one day, one at 3AM and one at 11PM lol), But I was feeling too fat and full to eat another one.

The slices are huge, too huge for the plates even. The crust is perfect. I don't remember my previous 2 experiences, but just recently, I went and had the white sauce chicken and spinach I believe. It was delicious, and adding back to my previous story, I was a major fatass this trip.

I really wanted Pin Up Pizza, but I had to try another Pizza place in Vegas just because, so I also tried Secret Pizza inside of Cosmo right after Pin Up, and I much prefer Pin up Pizza. I don't hate Secret Pizza, but if I had to choose between the two, I would always prefer Pin Up Pizza. I don't care if I'm staying at the Cosmo, I will make the short walk across the strip."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings, great staff and best value in the area and its on the strip .. not buried in a lavish hotel or casino.  Stephanie was awesome and she and the cook took good care of us. Great place to grab a quick bite during the day or late at night after going out. The combo is best deal. The pizza is good too very aromatic and flavorful, crisp crust nut not too crisp to where it hurts the roof of your mouth. Killer chow. Thanks again guys."}
{"text":"This pizza was sooo good. The line was out the door. They had this garlic knot that was DELICIOUS. I've thought about them a few times since leaving Vegas. Lol"}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good for a standard slice and fulfilling HOWEVER the customer service is lacking. The lady taking our order of a family of 4 was rude and unwelcoming. Didn't allow us time to figure out what slices we want since it was our first time there also because there are no name labels for which pizza has which toppings. She also did not finish taking our order and moved onto multiple guests after we had reminded her we were not done she told us to wait. Luckily the pizza wasn't as bad as her attitude. Seemed like even asking was an issue. She kept asking if we were done after every slice we would mention including the first considering there are more than one of us ordering food. Wouldn't reccomend or go back."}
{"text":"The pizza slices were large. The garlic knots were delicious. 

After being in Vegas for a few days we just wanted to grab something quick and easy to eat. I was impressed by the size of the slices.

My only complaint is that the patio area was small and did not have seating. Otherwise, great place for pizza."}
{"text":"I don't know what all the hype is. Tastes like an average pizza only in a bigger slice and a side of really dry bread. I give them 3 stars because the girl working was hilarious and kept the line moving quick"}
{"text":"Food is terrible pizza is dry... Warmed up a pre cooked slice of pizza... Meat was soggy on the all meat pizza.. No where to sit you have to stand and eat.. Super cramped small place... Didn't enjoy my food I don't recommend this place to eat"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! Heard of this place from my co-worker, and since I love pizza, I had to take a look for myself. If you've had Costco pizza you know how big the slices are, but this place tops it. A single slice is 15 inches. I felt the pricing was more than fair. A slice, garlic knot, and refillable soda for $8.99. I think that is a good value. Pizza was very good, it's thin crust, and the garlic knot was great as well. The women working there had the pinup look which was a good touch. There was a gentlemen by the name of Benji who who as great guy. Everyone there was very welcoming. 
I probably would have given this place 4 stars since the seating wasn't that great. Small outside patio section and small standing counter inside. So it did get a little crowded in there considering its 100° outside. But considering there is a walkway to a sports book inside the casino, it regained that star. Pizza and sports. Can't get much better than that. I definitely suggest this place if you are looking for a large slice of pizza with employees who play the part."}
{"text":"6 bucks for a slice of pizza, you cant beat that for the size of it. We stopped here for a little or may i say a big bite on our second day on the strip. My girlfriend was shopping at Planet Hollywood, and she ordered a a cheese pizza with chicken and a garlic knot to go, and i believe i ordered a italian pizza and pepperoni. She couldnt finish hers, it was weigh to big for her stomach, so we took it to our hotel room. Pizza is great, staff are a bit non attentive in making the pizza and placing orders, not the best service. Downside to this place is theyre arent any places to sit down and relax, so we took the pizza to our hotel room. Ill stop by again on my next trip to vegas."}
{"text":"It a good day  and a good  place to with your kids very clean good  sevice good  food  on the strip"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza. Quick service and it hits the spot late at night. I went in here twice and they were out of garlic knots both times. The second night we wisely decided to split a slice. That was plenty as a bedtime snack."}
{"text":"Amazing. Hands down best pizza ever. Everything was so fresh and full of flavor. It was so good, I had to go back another night. You must try this pizza, it's worth waiting in a line. Also the pizza was huge, bigger than the plate it was served on!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, only ok service. Reminded us of proper new york pizza. No seating, though - just standing tables. Worth it for the quality of the food. We went for the chicken/spinach and the meat lover type, both 9/10 at least.. Served nice and hot."}
{"text":"This place had some awesome pizza and look at the size of it. It was worth the price. Must try it if in Vegas. The price for the drinks is pretty expensive but pizza worth every penny. I was satisfied with the taste and size of pizza."}
{"text":"Just go eat there--you will not be disappointed if you truly enjoy pizza after a night out !!"}
{"text":"Aside from the fact that I felt like total crap after eating the pizza, it was quite tasty.  All five of our children had a slice and most finished 3/4 of it.  The kids were in awe of the size.  The knots were a hit, and I highly recommend the Sandra D, which is the value meal with a slice, a knot and a refillable soda.
There is no seating, and little standing space.  
We had a slight wait, but the staff is as efficient as they can be and had us through in under 10 minutes.  
There are pin ups everywhere (thus the name) and can provide great (teachable/informative) conversations with your children, no matter what the age. :). It's pretty tame compared to what you see on the street.  
We were just passing through, but this restaurant was a hit and if we pass through again, with the kids, it will probably be suggested as a place to stop.
The staff was very friendly and great with the kids (patient).  
It was a little difficult to find, but it's at the mile mall easily accessible outside, you can get to it from inside by the sport book, but the \"pizza by the slice\" sign says just that- it does not specify the name of the restaurant, which made it a little confusing."}
{"text":"Large slices but definitely consumable! I ate a slice of cheese like it was nothing, I still wanted more. This pizza is amazing. Perfectly cooked, the cheese is just right, the sauce is just right, no complaints. 

No seating area inside but there's a small stand up bar directly outside. You can sit in the sports center area and watch one of the games play on the 30+ screens. 

The girl working behind the counter was very nice as well."}
{"text":"This is a pretty good spot that is actually on the strip for a slice of pizza. The slice here are pretty big and will hit the spot, but for those with a bigger appetite, get the combo, which includes a drink and their garlic bread (knot). The slice always hits the spot for me. Its located right outside of Planet Hollywood along the strip and have a back way into the sports betting area. The workers here are friendly and sweet. They lay out of of the pizza parlor is cute, with pin up girl pictures everywhere. Its definitely worth a go if you are craving a slice on the go!"}
{"text":"Quick service! Big slice of pizza that could feed two for under $7. I had the margherita slice, which consists of mozzarella and cherry tomatoes. Simple, but so good!! The garlic knot was good as well. Must have pizza when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Yum love there pizza! Best pizza 
 ever in Las Vegas!! Large slices, different toppings, pretty decent prices for LV. Grab a beer also available to go with slice. In front of the main strip Plant Hollywood. If you going before a show at PH give yourself a little time there's usually always a line. Plus they have to warm up the pizza in the oven. Anyways a must in vegas!"}
{"text":"The pizza slices are an absolute eye delight!!  The pizza was very good-one slice was all it took.  Ok I did throw in a beer as well!  
On a side note, we did ask the pizza place if we could go to the back area to sit and eat which they said yes to.  However,  once back there at a table, we were informed no we needed to sit in the chairs down below as the table sitting area was reserved for restaurant patrons. 
Do not sit in the The Ringers Sports Bar and Racing Casino at Planet Hollywood, that area is reserved.  Would be nice to be redirected nicely. So, yes that was a down point for us.  Did not see anyone ordering food nor see anyone moving to sit in the area which we had been sitting in.  The only crowded area was indeed those chairs which we were directed to sit. 
So IF you do go to buy pizza, be warned - do not sit anywhere but the crowded chair area.  You will be told to move for non existent restaurant patrons who are not purchasing food from this casino/bar.  Better yet, buy your pizza and stand at the strip window area to watch the people outside!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a slice of pepperoni pizza here. The pizza was super thin but crisp and very large! When you walk in you are greeted by a staff who asks what you'd like to order. Since I just ordered a slice she took the slice from the pizza out from the display case and heated the pizza in the oven. The order also came with a garlic bread which was fluffy and sooo buttery, I loved it!  This place is pretty small. There is no seating inside but there are a few seats and tables outside. Sitting outside can be disturbing because birds come to feast on any crumb or leftover"}
{"text":"Stopped by after the club. When I walk the Strip I always see this place but never walked in. Well I was really hungry and didn't want to walk any further I decided to give this place a try. I probably waited 30 mins in line to order one slice or pepperoni pizza and it was worth it. Slices are huge and greasy pizza is always good. I'd come back when I'm in Vegas again."}
{"text":"I've never seen a pizza slice this large for such a good price! $12 for a slice, roll and a beer! My 21st was yesterday, so it was my first official pizza and beer combo. So glad I went there! The slice could have fed two. Got the margarita pizza with fresh mozzarella cheese, onions and the freshest of fresh cherry tomatoes.

Loved the staff as well! They were so friendly even though it seemed a tad busy. For a restaurant on the strip they have wonderful prices, fast service and seating with a view! It was standing table only, no chairs- but who cares with a angry orchard beer in your hand anyway!

My only complaint is the chili shakers. They need to buy shakers that can handle the size of the chili flakes. The holes could barely fit a handle of flakes coming out at a time."}
{"text":"It's more hype than taste. We waited 30 min in line.  Pizza was tasty but no where near NY quality. Go there if you're in town."}
{"text":"excellent service, amazing pizza & great prices!! this place is Awesome! must visit while you're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza served quickly and conveniently located next to the PH sports book."}
{"text":"For anyone in the know, has this place changed owners/managers recently?  Service was not nearly as friendly as it has the many times we have been there before.

This is the biggest slice of pizza that I have ever had!  I am in love with their margherita pizza.  The highlight of this pizza is those little cherry tomatoes.  I have never had a tomato that is so flavorful.  The crust is good, cheese is good but the reason I keep retuning is for those awesome little tomatoes.

Located conveniently on the strip in front of Planet Hollywood.

I come here every time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Finally ate here yesterday.  The slices of pizza are literally the size of your head. It was enough for two meals. Basically it's worth the money & quick service"}
{"text":"This Is Hands Down the best Pizza in Las Vegas! With friendliest servers and pizza makers.  Excellent quality ingredients made fresh in front of you. And the prices can't be beat!  Thanks Pin-up Pizza!"}
{"text":"Big meat slice. Meatball flavor was awesome and I liked that they were sliced like giant pepperoni. The slices were about as long as my forearms - crazy. Crust has a nice crunch and is new york style."}
{"text":"This pizza by the slice place has a hidden entrance from the casino but visible from the street. It is great for grab and go but there is a small bar type standing to eat and get a view of the strip. One slice is more than enough for adult and kids can split a slice. The service was excellent with a lot of patience with kids. We had four with us"}
{"text":"Came here twice in one trip. the Margharita pizza is amazing! The tomatoes are so juicy, never had anything like it. The pizza is HUGE! Also got a cannoli and it's very good. must stop if you're in Vegas. staff is very nice also. great prices."}
{"text":"Do you want a huge slice of pizza bigger than your head?  Do you want to eat it while standing up outside and people passing by stare at you while you stuff your face as gracefully as you can but fail since the pizza is just too big?  Well then search no further as this is the place for you.  For $10 you can get a slice and a drink.  The pizza is very decent and I really enjoyed my slice.  The cashier was dressed as a pin up girl and was very nice and gorgeous.  This is a great choice for a cheap filling quick bite."}
{"text":"Straight up salty! I got the Margherita pizza and ate it when I was sober, maybe that's why? Either way I won't come back again. The line was fast though."}
{"text":"I immediately was disappointed with this place because of your employee Candace . Candace has a nasty attitude and needs to be written up or fired . She made it very clear when I said I'm telling your manager you got an attitude with me and my friends for putting red pepper and cheese on our pizza at the register where the containers were sitting . I guess it's too much to ask politely could we move the containers where they belong and someone mistakenly set them at the register . She said she does not care if I report her . It's clear she hates her job . My friends told her we are all in service industry and would never disrespect customers in that way . The pizza was good but I was upset the entire time so I will never go back again . And I told All 5000 of my friends on Facebook and friends that visit Vegas not to go because of Candace . Customer service should be number one ."}
{"text":"I think this place is unique in the fact that the pizza is so oversized. However, taste wise, I don't think it was anything earth shattering. It is good, if you need a quick bite to eat or are in a hurry. Other than that, unless you want a novelty slice of pizza, I would go somewhere else.

There is no seating, so you either can eat at the standing counter, which is usually packed, or outside. 

There is a decent selection of toppings, but the taste is mediocre. It wasn't anything I was raving about when I came home. 

 Also I was kind of confused with the name of the shop. Since, it is called pin up pizza, it is decorated in past pin up girls. However, I do not think the way the shop is set up as grab and go pizza that the theme makes much sense. Before we ate here I thought it was a pizza place where the waitresses were dressed up as pinup girls. Since it is Vegas, I was expecting over the top. Instead it is just a quick stop decorated in pinups of the past."}
{"text":"Super happy I followed the advice of fellow Yelp-ers and tried Pin-Up pizza - it was a lot better than I was expecting! I got the margarita pizza and the tomatoes were so, so good; sweet and juicy! I only got the slice of pizza (which I thought was a steal for $7 considering the size), but in hindsight I would have sprung for a coke and garlic knot, too- they looked pretty good!"}
{"text":"Line was super long, no where to sit. The pizza...it was all okay. No real flavor and all of them a little dry. The best was the margarita pizza because of the balsamic gave it flavor and not as dry."}
{"text":"I think I was expecting more. The size is impressive even if your only taking away a slice. I love the perfect slice box for take away. But with any \"stiff\" a pizza previously cooked that is oven revitalized for your pleasure, the sauce and cheese ratio need to be appropriate. While good, we found our slices dry and in serious need of some sun kissed tomato sauce. The size of the portion only accentuated the need for more sauce. I have to say I am still on team Secret Pizza which is right across the boulevard."}
{"text":"Soon good! Was recommended to try this place from my sister. Huge huge 1 slice of pizza."}
{"text":"We always stay at Planet Hollywood, so this place has become a staple in our trips.  They never have ranch, so we buy it from Ringers next door, who have told us that the two share a kitchen so it's completely inexcusable for them to not have it.  We were just there at the end of March and the two girls working were so rude and dismissive to me and others in line that I made it a point not to return for the remainder of our stay and went to Secret Pizza instead.  I didn't choose the pizza life for you, so work on those attitudes, ladies."}
{"text":"CHEAP. LARGE. SLICE.

There isn't really anything more to say.  Sober, the pepperoni slice was delicious. Drunk the pepperoni slice was delicious.  

OVERALL:  I actually prefer this for late night pizza over secret pizza. Less hassle, good prices, and good slices!

Like I always say, YOU WON'T KNOW UNLESS YOU TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. I like my food hot... This pizza was exactly that. There was a hair on my crust, Ew. I don't eat the crust anyways so it didn't bother me that much LOL. Only reason I'm giving it 4 stars. Other than that the pizza was great. Not too much pizza sauce and just the right amount of cheese. Pepperoni was crispy just how I like it. Andddddd maybe the women should wear hair nets. Just a suggestion."}
{"text":"I looooooooove this place. Every time someone goes to Vegas, I suggest this place as a must. After a night of gambling strolled in at around 2am and they still had every slice available. The novelty here is obviously the enormous slices of pizza, but it's actually really good pizza. Try the chicken & spinach or the pancetta & mushroom, the only downside was they were out of togo boxes."}
{"text":"A bit of a hidden gem nestled by Planet Hollywood, we've been to Vegas many times and I never knew about this place. We saw Pin-Up featured on a BuzzFeed video and the size of the slices intrigued us.

The combo pizza/knot/soda for ~$10 is a great deal. You can get any kind of available slice and the whole meal is very filling. Inside is limited standing room only space and there are additional standing tables outside. The pizza itself was good for West Coast although I wish there was a way to get a fresh slice instead of the reheat method. The garlic knot was just okay, not dense like a NY style knot but more like a thin dinner roll covered in seasoning. The staff was super friendly and everything was served up very quick. I'd definitely come back here for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Take my advice.  Walk across the street to Secret Pizza.  You'll thank me.  If you are drunk and desperate this will do the trick but don't expect much.   I got the slice, knot and drink combo.  I ate less then half and I was drinking all day hungry.  Can't imagine how it would be sober."}
{"text":"U have to eat it right away cause if you dont its the hardest pizza you will ever eat lol its a okay pizza to some it up,
Put it this way if your from new york and like to fold your pizza with little to no sauce you will enjoy it, 
If your from chicago like myself then you will hate this pizza because its bland and flavorless 
This is not a good pizza and to think i bought a slice of each one"}
{"text":"Pin Up Pizza is located in front of the Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino right along the Vegas Strip. It has a walk up counter and a few seats. In addition to whole pizza pies and slices, they also serve some pretty amazing garlic knot rolls. They are super garlicky and buttery but flaky and light like a croissant. For better or worse, I could easily eat a dozen of these.  In addition to the good looking food they also have good looking staff dressed in classic pin up girl uniforms. You could waste an entire night watching these ladies load in and take out the slices from the oven. Now I should probably talk about the pizza. It is some of the least expensive and largest slices on the strip, Weighing in at a staggering 14 inch slice for about $5.00. It is also some of the best depending on the kind you get. I found the pepperoni to be just average, the sauce was just a little to thick and the crust just a little under cooked. The winner for me was the white pizza, topped with Ricotta, Chicken, Mozzarella, fennel and spinach. The thin crust was cooked perfectly crispy and the toppings were abundant but not so much that it made the crust soggy. This particular slice was on par with my favorite pizza at The Secret Pizza across the road at The Cosmopolitan. So overall one slice was just okay and the other was one of the best i have had. I will probably make this a routine stop in the future. Good staff, good pizza and good times can be found at Pin Up Pizza."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a late night Vegas munchie run on the way back to The Aria.  I'd been telling my honey all night that I needed to get something sweet and they got the bill with the salami trio slice and cannoli.  Kinda bummed that they didn't have the spinach and chicken slice available, they said that they literally ran out of dough.  The salami trio was really tasty and original with peppercinis and different kinds of salami.   They also had beer and beer-a-ritas to go.  I got a straw-ber-ita for $6.50, 25 oz, 8% alcohol.  

However, the cannoli was Amazeballs!  I think it was pistachio, I have no idea.  All I know is it was reminiscent of cheesecake and will likely haunt me at the most inconvenient times.  Craveable.  I dare say I may go back there tomorrow for another.  We will be here for a few nights after all."}
{"text":"The line was long and the pizza wasn't that good. Our hostess and cook were very nice and entertaining. I ended up getting heartburn  

Will not be back, to me it was over rated."}
{"text":"the garlic knots are off the hook, so fresh and light...perfect amount of garlic and butter...a must try"}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza and great combo deals, head into the casino with your pizza and bet on some sports, True Mancave style"}
{"text":"Looking for a nice affordable meal on the Strip? Look no further than Pin-up Pizza. This place gives huge slices and when I say huge I mean huge. Look at the pictures, these single slices are more like 2 slices from a normal pie. The staff was friendly and the pie was heated up and deliver to me in a minute or so. They have some stand up seating inside and some outdoor seating on the strip. When it is a 100+ you probably would just rather take it inside PH and find a seat somewhere to eat it. Maybe outside Earl of Sandwhich. 

Slice prices are reasonable and not as crazy like the pinks hot dogs next door. It will really fill you up, I shared and both of us were full from a single slice. I give this place 5 stars based on convenience, price, portion size and service. Is it the best pizza ever? Probably not but it is better than most and all the other reasons make it a nice spot to hit up if you are hungry."}
{"text":"I'm very surprised at the amount of low star reviews on this place. I first heard about this place from following Insider Food & travel on instagram. They posted a video of these enormous slices of pizza, and i myself being a pizza addict, had to try it! On a recent trip to Vegas we stopped in on a Monday afternoon around noon and waited in line for about 20 minutes (not bad considering that you're in Vegas and the lines everywhere are bound to be long). The pizza was delicious, and as advertised, bigger than my head! The prices were great as well. $6-$8 for a slice, or  $12-$13 for a combo (pizza, garlic knot, drink) depending on if you're getting pop or a beer. 

There are no tables, just standing room only, so not great for groups. However, great to stop in for a late night snack (they're open till 4am!!). I will definitely be stopping back in the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Not totally sure about the hype for this place...

It is basically take-out only.  They have single slices that are huge, and very expensive.  The quality is fine, but nothing exceptional.  

Be careful though, the pizza is very hot.  I burned the roof of my mouth and had to deal with that for a few days following."}
{"text":"Big pizza, all hours of the day. Drunk clientele, I'm sure most of the time as well. Nothing really extraordinary happens here but there aren't any notable negatives. 
It's a walk up pizza joint smack dab in the middle of the strip. It's probably been a welcoming relief to many tired, drunk partiers. Its Vegas. Inhaling a hot board of meat and cheese in the middle of some sort of debauchery is what you do here. A generous three stars is what feels right here."}
{"text":"Such a good deal for the price you pay.. especially when it comes to eating on the stripe which can be a little pricey. I ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza along with the garlic knot and a beer. Outstanding prices and outstanding food! Definitely will be back again. The garlic knot is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Nice people serving pretty good pizza.   Slices are huge and they make traditional and unique pizza to choose from.   Stayed at planet Hollywood and went back once more.  Would stop again."}
{"text":"I've been to Vegas three times and this was my first time ever finding this pizza spot. It's located in between restaurants so i know why I missed it so many times. This pizza is sooooo delicious to me, i had it about three times in the week I was out there. Huge Slices for the price they were at."}
{"text":"Quick and easy. Best thing this place has going for it is the location. Pizza was good, slice was huge, price was OK, and the service was friendly. There are at least four other places to grab a slice in or attached to Planet Hollywood. I haven't tried them all, but this is the best of the ones I have. I liked the Secret Pizza place across the street at the Cosmopolitan a little better, but if I was standing in front of this place, it wouldn't be worth the short walk over the bridge to get to it."}
{"text":"Yummmmm so great tasting hugeeee pizza!!! My only hold back on one star was because the wait takes some time.... It's nice they reheat the pizza.. But it's gets all backed up in the front cuz it's a small place and everyone is waiting for their slice. But the pizza pieces are huge!! And price isn't bad either I would recommended it."}
{"text":"Really good pie. Would eat here anytime. Had the margherita pizza slice. Having thus slice I wanted more. And they had Rootbeer on the fountain. Not easy to find. After eating my slice, I didn't get that bloated feeling from the crust."}
{"text":"pin up girl and chef were nice! not crowded and pizza was rewarded on oven.. they were out of those cool pizza boxes do we took pizza on a plate folded up... eh whatever I was staying a PH so I got to my room with hot food for me and the kids.. pizza slices are gigantic like literally the size of my daughters arm.. Taste is mediocre though... I wasn't drunk..maybe next time lol"}
{"text":"Pizza bomb af and very big every time I'm out here this is all I eat ... pin up and fat Tuesday my VEGAS diet lol so if u hit vegas the only pizza needed to have is pin up"}
{"text":"Hubby saw the advertisement for this place on Facebook about a week before our scheduled visit to Vegas. Naturally, we had to check them out. Place is small, you come in one door out another to a standing eating area. A day ago we passed by the line was extra long but not today. They have combo for $10.25 or $12.75 slice, knot soda or beer. They sell by the slice $6-7 The slices are big, yea but did not appear as big as advertised. One slice is about 2 slices. The garlic knot was tasty but doughy. The pizza was ok, no big deal, maybe because I'm from NY and I know what real pizza taste like."}
{"text":"We picked up Pin-Up Pizza as a late-night fix for a no dinner evening. I had read up on this shop prior to visiting Vegas and was excited to try it after all the great reviews. NO. Just NO. Yes, it's a slice the size of a Volkswagon Beetle. But it tastes AWFUL. I bought a slice of pepperoni and when I opened the container, it was clearly old and dried up. It tasted TERRIBLE. Not even worth $7 and the time I wasted getting it. Yuck."}
{"text":"OMG!!!  Best pizza ever!!!  I am in pizza heaven.  A definite must if you are in Vegas"}
{"text":"Not worth the money. Save your money and head to Fremont for rock pizza. The pizza was bland and the sauce had a weird taste to it. The slice was huge, but only if it tasted good. It gave my friend the runs and will not return."}
{"text":"I was here today - and there are no pretenses -  the pizza is authentic - as a northern Jersey girl I can say that. Greasy some say - what? The best pizza has some oil rolling around. Loved it. Had a slice with sausage (good Italian sausage), a garlic knot and a beer for $11.50. I ate it in the shop standing up and I'm ok with that. Saw them give marinara for other guests. Friendly staff. You should see the size of the pies that make these HUGE slices! Wow. Strongly recommend - I'm going to get one tonight for my 5:30 breakfast ;) - probably the only time they are not open."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim, and an very glad that I did. 

The pizza is already made, just raw. So they cook it when you order it. So the pizza is hot and fresh. The portions are huge, and very filling. 

The garlic knots are amazing! I had one and wanted more. The margarita pizza was fantastic. I would come here again and recommend it no doubt."}
{"text":"My least favorite of the 3 pizza joints I tried in Vegas late-night. It wasn't bad. It was okay. The garlic knots were super soft...just no garlic or olive oil goodness like you get up north. So I was disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the place to get some food while you are drunk or about to head to bed. The pizza slice can feed 2 people! Comes out hot! I believe a slice is $6. Say no more to a fat hangover in the morning. This pizza will keep you full! Located next to the planet hollywood sportbook. So next time after a night of clubbing, ditch the mcdonalds or Pho. Hit up this pizza joint. Everything tastes good when you're drunk! Ha"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended so we were excited to find this hidden pizza place at Planet Hollywood. The thin crust pizza was delicious, and we loved the garlic knot bread. Even though I am giving the food five stars, Angela, who took our order left a horrible taste in my mouth. 

We had two teenagers with us, and they were not quite sure what they wanted so me and my sister ordered first. My daughter and her cousin then ordered. We were deciding if we should order more. Even though no one else was there, Angela kept \"asking\" if we wanted anything else. When I finally asked if she was in a hurry - she snidely replied that we all should have been ready to order.

A place with a name with Pin Up Pizza should train their employees to not only provide good food but also the \"experience\".

Angela - even though you were dressed for the part, you certainly did not have the personality for a pin up girl. Thanks for ruining our visit!"}
{"text":"The bartender at Planet Hollywood suggested this place when my husband asked where he could find some good NY style pizza (large slice, thin crust and foldable is NY style to us). 
Pin-up Pizza did not disappoint; it was very good and 1 piece was perfect for each of us. The slices here are HUGE; more like 2.5 slices of a regular pizza. I got a slice of cheese and it was I think a little over $6; you'll pay more when you start adding toppings. 
You can get to this place from the strip or you can get to it from the sports bar in Planet Hollywood. There are no tables inside; it's just a counter where you order, however, I noticed a couple tables out in front of this place.
We've visited Planet Hollywood many times and I can't believe it took so long to go to this place... it'll definitely be a go-to spot for us now. It's perfect, order a slice and take it back to the bar for a quick dinner while getting your gamble on. Yum yum!"}
{"text":"Perhaps I was too sober for this place, but the pizza was unpalatably too salty. They're HUGE slices though, so if you can stomach it, that's great. Just watch for the tip of the pizza falling over the edge of the plate and hitting the nasty counter by the cashier. They didn't offer to replace it, so I asked for a plastic knife, cut off the tip, and hurled it into the trashcan. What an unsatisfactory experience.

The friends we were with raved about this place. To each his own!"}
{"text":"Good pizza in the Las Vegas strip Quick and easy and it definitely is the spot every single time"}
{"text":"I am in love with this place! Seriously my favorite pizza! They're so HUGE! And soooo delicious! It's usually packed, but this pizza is definitely worth the wait! Sober or drunk! I'm impressed with how the girls stay calm and move the line quick. Dealing with so many tourists and locals isn't very easy. I go to the strip just to eat this pizza! Good thing planet Hollywood has free parking."}
{"text":"Their pizzas are really good here! I've had the margherita and pancetta/potato pizza.  The crust is very crispy.  I like that they finish cooking the pizza right when you order it.  It's fast pizza that's super big and hot when you get it.  I've tried the more popular one across the street, but I prefer this one.  They're both hot and crispy, but this one is bigger and you get more flavor choices."}
{"text":"A must try! The pizza is really Big and good! They are located at Planet Hollywood hotel. You can see them from the walk way right in front of the hotel. They have some outside seating and a small standing bar top table inside. A great place to grab a slice on the go while you walk around on the strip."}
{"text":"There are many pizza joints popping up now in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip. From Secret Pizza (Cosmopolitian) to Five50 Pizza Bar (Aria) to Sbarros (everywhere lol), you have your choice of pizza selections all over.

But I would be hard pressed to find a better pizza combo deal than the one that exists at Pin Up Pizza, located in front of Planet Hollywood. For $9.50, you can have any slice + garlic knot + fountain soda. Just say to the cashier, \"THE SANDRA D COMBO PLEASE\". 

I choose the meatball pepperoni slice as part of my combo. Even though it is not authentic New York pizza, it is still pretty darn satisfying considering it's price. The slice is HUGE too. The real winner of the pizza combo is the garlic knot though. It's the best garlic knot I have ever had; even better than the ones from New York.

If you are trying not to break the bank in finding a inexpensive lunch on the Las Vegas Strip and you don't want to eat panda express or McDonalds, definitely try Pin Up Pizza. You will need that oily pizza grease to soak up your alcohol intake at the end of night ;)"}
{"text":"Eh........ it's not what you're thinking. 

The online site and review sites show a nice sit down environment like a full service restaurant, but instead it's a 'walk into this tiny storefront, order and there may be some seating available in the sports gambling area of Planet Hollywood, or just eat in front of the hot sweltering window... (No thank you).

Don't get me wrong, that area was chill and I could totally nap in those comfy chairs, but it's not the experience I was looking for. 

The ingredients are cheap. There's much better and even worse pies to ingest in Vegas, but with lunch deals under $9-10... you really can't beat it. 

I don't think I would return if it's still here when I get back to Vegas, but.... 

A-OK"}
{"text":"This place has the four essential things to good late-night dining: affordable, good music, good service, and delicious food. The ambience is really great - this is something that is important to me. The pizza selections are great and it's not overly done. I had the pepperoni and my wife had the cheese - she's pretty particular with pizza and she was happy with the pizza. Not too much cheese and just the right thickness (it's pretty thin). The slices are pretty big - bigger than the paper plate it comes on so it is more than enough to fill you up. You must get the pizza, drink, and garlic knot combo. The garlic knot is DELICIOUS. I wish I had more. It's soft and slightly chewy and great seasoning. Like a puff knot with substance. Good food and you can't beat it. True NY style pizza. Delicious."}
{"text":"The pizza is definitely big and hot when you get them. The staff is amazing and the place is quick too. They have a small standing section to eat at which makes this a more of a quick eat and go place. Sadly they were out of knots, but it was 1am.
I'm out of state and would for sure recommend this place to others from out of state for the experience."}
{"text":"These slices are massive! Thin NY style pizza, your basic flavored. This place is right outside of Planet Hollywood but wasn't on the Miracle Mile map for some reason. Great for a quick bite and with them being open late, great for after drinking snack! I took mine to go!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good service was awful. Toni the cashier had an attitude through the whole transaction. At the end when we went to grab the pizzas she slapped our hands away and told us to wait until. We are all grown adult we do not need to be told to wait to grab our food because she does not know how to her job."}
{"text":"The spot is connected to the Planet Hollywood sportsbook enough said! Heavy drinking is next door and the crowd comes with it! We stopped in here to soak up some of the liquor after serious night of drinking. We met some Canadians at the tables and sponsored the pizza which made that pizza incredible! Yelp help the experience because they offered free beer with a check in!"}
{"text":"Don't bother waiting in the strangest designed pizza place with giant, heavy, mediocre pizza slices. The dough is white on the bottom and gets no color. The flavor is just ok as the sauce needs improvement, and doesn't have nearly enough cheese.

On a side note, they ran out of to go boxes, so are only able to serve slices on paper plates? Kind of hard to bring a few slices back to your room without making a mess.

Does not have hand sanitizer next to register, as cashier is handling money and coins and then touching and grabbing paper plates with her dirty hands and putting them on top on the pizza. 

No thanks"}
{"text":"Never tried this place. Came after a drunkrn night after a comedy show.. Got the drunken munchies & was craving pizza. Saw how huge the slices were so my husband & I thought we would try it. When we got there line was long but moving kinda fast. There were only 2 girls & 1 guy making the huge pizza. One girl was re warming yes I said rewarming so no not fresh who knows how long the slices have been sitting under heat lamps. The other girl was working the register. She. Was really sweet. How ever the girl that was rewarming ppls slices in the oven she seemed very unhappy to b there just attitude after attitude. But whatever as long as I gets pizza who cares. We all work we all have bad days @ times. However since pizza wasn't fresh & had to b rewarmed didn't taste all that. It was good but not all that others made it out to be. All in all if ur drunk & in the area. I guess."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Located inside Planet Hollywood but the outside strip has access of it too. This place is bad a$$! First, this sexy big breasted lady with dark brown hair is wearing a corset and heavy makeup to serve pizza. Then, if your order is to go, she has to assemble the triangular box quickly. The humongous slice of pizza gets heated up in the oven and it was so good. Each slice was worth roughly $6-7. But the slice equals 3 pizza hut slices. Not only is it a generous portion, it taste really good. The bread of the pizza has a crisp. Cook to perfection! It is also bad a$$ to see the cook put in the whole pizza in the oven. Amazing and worth coming!"}
{"text":"A good and hearty slice on the strip.  Friendly staff. Selections are a relative few, but the choices are good enough to enjoy a New York slice."}
{"text":"Sure you're pushing $7 a slice after tax on a piece of pepperoni pizza, but guess what? You're totally getting 2.5 slices in one. 

Not only that, but it's a damn good crust and requires far less of a hike than Secret Pizza if you are just wandering the strip! Located right outside of Planet Hollywood. Extra easy if you're intoxicated and feel the challenge of distance is too great to overcome. 

They serve Diet Pepsi products and of course, Red Bull and beer. Not sure what type of Vegas establishment this would be otherwise..."}
{"text":"I can see why everyone thinks this place is the best slice on the strip. NY style thin crust with perfect blend of cheese and sauce. Crush a slice or two late night, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Horrible service. They have all their pizzas up in the window by the slice. The refuse to sell it to you with out putting it back in the oven. They claim the pizza is \"par cooked\"... I'm sorry this is not earl of pizza. We could see the pizza was fully cooked. Ruby the manager and the two servers working the line were completely rude and dismissive. They said we could get sick if they served us pizza off the line with out reheating it in the oven. Actually the first girl said meat pizza had to go back in because the meat was raw (never saw raw pepperoni before). There is nothing btw in raw pizza dough that would make u sick. The operation was horribly inefficient. Why would you par cook pizza anyway when you have a line. I have never heard of this ever in a pizza by the slice restaurant. Awful. Rude."}
{"text":"Came here one late night after EDC and couldn't be happier with the great price and size of the pizza slice. It's ginormous! Only con was the limited selection, but what they do have is all delicious"}
{"text":"I have been here so many times every time I make my way to Vegas. The pizza is a big size which isn't to thin or too thick. Has the perfect crunch. Except last time we went it was more expensive than usual so maybe the prices changes. About 6.99 a slice. The ranch is also amazing!"}
{"text":"The pizza (pepperoni/prosciutto) was absolutely delicious. Very very close to New York style pizza - thin crust.
Service: meeehhh! one girl was very polite and helpful and the other one looked as if it was the last place she wanted to be - curt and not helpful. 
Pin-up name: cool name, but the costumes can look better, much better. The bra straps/back could be seen outside of the costume, which makes them look very tacky!"}
{"text":"Thanks to the friendly Canadian that we met at the casino, this meal was free-ninety-nine... Otherwise, I probably would've had to chop off a 1/2 star or so. The pizza did what it was supposed to do after a night of drinking but was less-than-average and definitely could've used more cheese. We did appreciate the Yelp offer for the free beer - again, another reason for the rating. Other than that, there are better late night pizza spots on the strip."}
{"text":"We got the 4 garlic knots and a slice of the Margherita pizza. The food was baked in the little oven. The garlic knots came out hot and they were buttery and soft. 

The Margherita pizza did not use any tomato sauce. The pizza was topped with some dollops of baked mozzarella and some cherry tomatoes crushed with basil. Making a good sauceless pizza is hard. Pin Up's cherry tomatoes gave you a tangy mouthful so the lack of sauce did not feel acute. 

This place is small and quirky. I loved that the servers are dressed up in pin up outfits. The slices are huge!! The length is that of 2 tv remotes. For this size and decent quality, the price of $6.50 is bang for your buck. If in Vegas, I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Yes the slice is big and yes it's a good value. But the pizza is average. We had the big meat and the spinach/artichoke pie. If you're on that end of the strip, worth a try."}
{"text":"Excellent NY-style pizza located at Planet Hollywood!

You can enjoy your slice while people-watching and overlooking the strip.

As of 11/30/2014, they don't have fixed prices for entire pizzas, so they just add up the price per slice (should you decide to get different ones)."}
{"text":"Just ate there today for lunch. I really did enjoy this pizza.  The crust was good and the amount of cheese was great.  The gal at the counter was very nice. We ordered two pepperoni slices and thought they were very tasty. We will be going here again."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza! Loved that the crust was crispy right out of the oven. Slices are freakin HUGE! However, $6-7 a slice is a bit ridiculous, even if the slices are big. But if you're looking for something to eat that's quick and decent and open late on the strip then I'd recommend Pin Up Pizza."}
{"text":"Kitchy little place out in front of Aria. Nice slices, fast service. Pleasant vibe with the 50s pinup outfits, and quality food. The garlic rolls are huge. 
Good deal for combo of a very large slice of anybpizza, garlic roll and soda for under 10 bucks.
You'll be in and out fast even after they heat the slice in the pizza oven for you.
You can east outside on a counter overlooking the strip."}
{"text":"Our first night in Vegas, we arrived quite late at night and by the time we checked in our hotel and got settled,  we were beyond hungry. I scoured Yelp, as usual, and came across a host of restaurants in our hotel. You know that saying, \"pictures are worth a thousand words?\" Well that quote isn't entirely true because a few choice words could have easily summarized the taste of this pizza. Salty and rubbery. 

I blame the photos because we were suckered into getting a large slice of this gigantic pizza thinking it would be good. Coming from NY state we have a lot of great pizza and Pin up pizza couldn't hold a candle stick the the real stuff. Although this pizza is massive, it tastes super salty and gross. These days carbs are far and few between, so when we get a chance to indulge, it better be well worth the treat. There are way too many better places to dine on the strip to settle for this."}
{"text":"This place was awesome, I had two slices from here the plain slice and then the prosciutto slice which was amazing! After a long day of drinking and betting at the sports book this was a great night cap after hitting a 3 team parlay in sin city!"}
{"text":"I'm staying at the Planet Hollywood and this is a good place to get a quick bite to eat. The pizza slices are large!  Thought I wouldn't be able to finish the slice... But I did.  It's pretty good!"}
{"text":"Yes, this place typically has a long line, but it's quick and well worth the wait for $7. The slices are huge and thin crusted. The prices are clearly listed. Hence, don't order weird shit and your pizza will be delicious."}
{"text":"Not great pizza. Don't bother trying to sit at the ringer and order lunch it takes for ever the service is horrible."}
{"text":"Pizza is the bomb! Located by PH, slices are huge and open late! I'm not even a thin pizza eaten kinda girl, sooooo yeah!"}
{"text":"HUGE slices!  They have combo specials with a garlic knot and a drink but the single slice was more than enough to fill me up.  I was happy to see a spinach and artichoke pizza, because that's my favorite and not something every pizza joint keeps on hand by the slice.  Check in on yelp and get a free beer!  Best check in offer I've come across yet! :)"}
{"text":"ITS LIKE IM IN NEW YORK. The pizzas are so nicely thinned, not overly sauces, not too salty. It was delicious. Not too much grease left behind on the box. AND LETS TALK ABOUT THE SIZE IT WAS BIGGER THAN MY THIGHS. If you think Costco pizza slices are huge, think again."}
{"text":"The food here... DELICIOUS... 

The service... well depends... are you asking about the person checking you out or the person putting the pizza in the oven? The entire fifth star is not given because of the rude service at the register! Granite... what do you expect at 3am with a bunch of drunk people in line, but even at 2pm with SOBER customers the service was less than mediocre. 

I rate places on quality of food and service... not just the food and although the pizza was DELICIOUS... the staff left an all but sour taste in my mouth!! The african american chick working the Saturday evening (early Sunday morning) shift was a total b-word!   I was drunk, and just flirting with the pizza guy (all in good fun of course) and she acted as if I was running around naked trying to hump him behind the counter... If you hate your job or the people you have to serve... get a new job! 

Ok rant done... 

The pizza was delicious... my favorite was the spinach artichoke... and yes... we went 2x in one day... for the pizza and garlic knot of course! 

I'd eat here again drunk or sober!!"}
{"text":"This was prob the worst pizza I have ever had. Very little to no sauce or toppings. I knew it was cheaper pizza but I expected it to be a edible. I would pass on this pizza. If your really hungry and in the area Pinks Hotdogs is right next door."}
{"text":"This place is a joke yes the slices are big we waited like 1/2 an hour in line to have your pizza just sitting and then they throw it in a pizza oven that's kinda dirty from all the pizza being heated up and then you get your pizza no where to sit just stand if the is room and there is only two people working they are trying there best and the pizza has charcoal under the crust and you bite into that and yuck threw it away it was nasty and it was just pepperoni  won't go back waste of time and money"}
{"text":"Excellent crispy big slices. Just what you need when you need pizza
Part of Ringers pizza menu. 
Stand up bar, huge pizzas, deserts, fountain Pepsi drinks"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place while walking to get Earl of Sandwich & stopped in my tracks when I saw people coming out with huge, & I mean huge, slices of pizza!

Great place to pickup something quick yet delicious!  The restaurant is tiny, just big enough for a line of people.  No seats just a standing section inside & outside.

Slice of pizza, garlic knot, & beer= $10.99

Pepperoni:  Give me that yummy!  The slice was ridiculously big, it was the size of my torso.  So cheesy & good.
Chicken & Spinach:  Good but the chicken was pretty dry. 
Garlic Knot:  So tasty, flaky, & buttery!"}
{"text":"I only came here because a buddy of mine thats never been here wanted to come. So I did. I should've taken him to Naked City or Verrazano's if I had known he wanted some good, NY pie. I spent $27.45 I think for 2 slices of pizza and 2 beers. 

As a Las Vegas local, I've rarely felt more violated than I did at Pin Up Pizza. Should be called Stick Up Pizza, because I feel like I got stuck up at gunpoint for that $27.

I cant believe I waited in line 25 minutes to spend $27 on 2 pieces of pie and 2 beers... I feel like such a dummy.

The pizza wasn't bad. It was actually good. But for $27, I should be talkin to the fuckin marinara Gods with every bite. I didn't speak to any Gods of Marinara. I wish I wouldve got the chicken & spinach now instead of the Big Meat. 

If you're a tourist looking for a line for NY pizza on the Strip, then Pin Up Pizza is a good spot. But otherwise I wish I would've went to a local spot. 

Shame on me for not taking the tourist to a LOCAL spot!"}
{"text":"Ate here late Tuesday night, probably Wednesday morning since I think it was after midnight...the place was packed, line out the door, must be a good sign, right? Nah, the pizza wasn't that good, it was HUGE, but also almost $7 for one slice, so not worth it.  The crust was like cardboard, the sauce was just ok, nothing to write home about. The girl behind the counter was nice to us, but I did witness an altercation between her and another customer, he must have said it was cold or something wasn't right because she ripped the plate out of his hand and forcefully threw it into a trash can behind her and then not so nicely shoved another plate with a slice on it at him.  I would not go out of my way to go here again, unless I was so intoxicated that I couldn't make it to another restaurant and even then, I might just try to go somewhere else anyways."}
{"text":"The portion of course is HUGE. The garlic knots are the star of the show. It's worth getting a combo. There is no actual seating area, so in dead summer, get it to go. The pizza lacked sauce. It was pretty dry. The chicken on the spinach pizza was good. I would try it again. In hopes of less of a dry pizza. Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"A friend brought back pizza to our hotel room and JUST THE SIZE OF THE SLICE TOOK ME BY SURPRISE! you know your getting your fill when the slice is literally FOLDED to fit the paper plate lol it was VERY good, we had simple pepperoni but still very tasty. Im normally picky about crust but this one was garlicky and not too dusty or greasy. Just right. Perfect midnight munch between drinks :)"}
{"text":"After a few days of non-stop drinking and after viewing a so-so (damn clouds) eclipse from Harrah's rooftop, we came here as our last meal back to LB. 

If you walk here, it's approx. 1 mile from Harrah's to Planet Hollywood. 15-20 mins. to walk??? So you can work off some calories then eat then walk off the carbs again! 

NO LINE TODAY at 1pm! 

No more patio seating or seats inside this restaurant. Yes, it's hard to find, it's next to the Sportsbook area (waaaaaay in the back of the Planet Hollywood casino) yes just stay to the right and look for the pizza by the slice neon sign. Or if you stay on the outside, walk around the shops and it's next to Pinks hot dogs. 

Got me a Bettie P. Combo, $11.75 price as of August 21, 2017, IMO I think it's one of the best meal deals on the Strip. It's good enough to share if you just want to satisfy your appetite or it's good for one hungry person like me!

Only one pin-up girl working today and one chef. I guess it's not too busy during the day compared to evenings and after hitting up the clubs.

Just get the meatball-pepperoni-pancetta-Italian sausage pizza. With beer. With the solo garlic knot. The best cure-all! Deeelish NY style cheesy thin crust pizza. Not too saucy and that's good for me otherwise the heartburn would've been in overdrive. 
I've been to NYC a few times but this is without the attitude!!!! 

Just ask for the pizza box cause I think the plate is pointless.....or they should serve it on parchment paper. Ate the huge-ass slice in the sportsbook area while watching the soccer games. No big deal."}
{"text":"First time in vegas as an adult and someone recommended this place for a quick bite 

I got the chicken spinach and bubs got the pepperoni of course

I kid you not, the pizza was the size of my face!!!!! 
The slice was equivalent to 3-4 regular slices! 
I was unable to finish it. 

The taste was 3/5. Mediocre
They fire up the pizza slice so it's nice and toasty. 

Will be coming back when I'm in vegas again. 
You definitely get your money's worth"}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious! So many delicious options to choose from I love this place. Can't wait to come back and enjoy a big slice again"}
{"text":"Pin up girl working was very rude. She would not serve me a beer and the next time we went back she recognized me. She asked if I had been there before and asked if there was going to be an issue, if so she would not serve me. I did nothing wrong and I am never rude. The only reason why I did not speak my mind to her rudeness was that I wanted my pizza. Pizza and garlic knots were very good!"}
{"text":"Before venturing to Las Vegas I heard this place was one of the best pizza places on the block. I can tell you by one experience this is a false statement. On their door it clearly says they close at 4AM and at 3:30AM their doors were closed for service. I looked at an employee and held up my 4 fingers to signal they close at 4AM and they signaled they were closed. This is disappointing to say the least and I as an employee of a fast food restaurant this is appalling. The fact that a company would claim they're closed 30 minutes prior to their business hours on the door is false advertisement
 and I will never give this company business."}
{"text":"The pizza is okay and the staff has a little attitude. I read reviews on this place and wanted to try it. The slice was gigantic but the taste is average."}
{"text":"Good food, good price and really good customer service. The pizza was huge and it it was really good. I got a pizza, know and beer for $12. It's right on the strip and good for people watching."}
{"text":"This place is so good! There will be a line but it moves so fast ! The slice is enough for two people ! But you won't want to share it ! Pepperoni and cheese are super good , and there is booze options for the combo !"}
{"text":"Is it bad that I crave this every weekend and I live in ARIZONA?
Pizza is amazing Garlic not is so delicious. Staff is ok there always busy maybe that's why there not Amazing at customer service. I think it a must each time I Visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Great NY style thin crust pizza. Chewy edges, crispy base, flavorful sauce and salty cheese. Good proportions of crust, sauce and toppings and pretty quick service. Good variety of by the slice options and not too greasy. $6.50 is fair on the strip. Awesome choice for a quick slice if watching a game at the planet Hollywood sportsbook right around the corner."}
{"text":"A tiny little place right outside the hard rock hotel. No inside seating, there is only a long table you can stand at. The pizza is gigantic! Pick your flavor and they will heat it up for you. One slice is about $7. I really enjoyed the crunchy crust. We got the mushroom and bacon one. It has almost full slices of bacon on it. We pulled them apart, bc it made biting into the pizza a bit of a challenge. Overall the pizza was good, nothing super special. I wouldn't mind going back, but wouldn't go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"$5.25 for a huge slice that can feed two people easily. How can you how wrong?!? Plus the taste is awesome. Been here few times and their taste and service is consistent. Service is fast and they have nice selection of drinks. Perfect for on the go walking on the strip or a midnight snack."}
{"text":"Pretty good standing room only pizza place.  The slices are over-sized and the prices are pretty good for Vegas.  They have a combo with a garlic knot and beer for $12.  Just be prepared to eat standing up or possibly go into the Miracle Mile shops where you can find plenty of seating!"}
{"text":"Very large slices at reasonable prices (by Vegas standards, not mine). A slice of cheese is $5.75 and single knots are $1.00. The food is decent but its not the best/worst pizza I've ever had. Right in the middle. Fast service. A good place to stop by on the strip when you don't want to talk too far. This is right outside the Planet Hollywood / Miracle Mile Shops."}
{"text":"We came rather late with the \"just leaving the club\" crowd. They were out of just about everything and the line was long. The pizza, however, was delicious. The pizza slices were enormous.  I would recommend this place for a quick stop."}
{"text":"Loved the pizza here! Secret Pizza in the Cosmo may be more well known, but Pin Up Pizza at Planet Hollywood definitely holds its own. 

First of all, the pictures don't do it justice...the slices are HUGE. The pizza is actually good as well, they have several varieties for you. I opted for the All Meat Slice and it hits the spot. Very generous with the amounts of toppings and cheese. They heat up your slice in the oven for you so it's served hot and fresh! Well worth the $6-$7 price! And let's be honest, you won't find many options on the Strip for under $10...

Located outdoors right in front of the Planet Hollywood/Miracle Mile entrances, it is very easy to find. It's open until 4am and is a popular late night spot but the lines move a whole lot quicker then Secret Pizza at Cosmo. Sadly, they were out of garlic knots when I went around 1am. But will have to try next time!

If you have been drinking and are in the Southern area of the Strip, definitely grab a slice from Pin Up...trust me! Best DRUNCHIES ever and you'll feel a whole lot better in the AM!

Final Piece of Dirty Donovan Life Advice? They will cut it in half for you...just ask! One slice is definitely more than enough for most people!"}
{"text":"$6.50 for a giant slice of  pepperoni pizza. The fam loved it but they all got the Big Meat. I think they were just starving though. Mine was too burnt on the bottom to get me excited. It did the trick but I won't be back. If your coming plan to take it to go or stand at the 10 ft counter to eat. This is not a sit down joint. But the pizza is thin enough you could fold it in half and eat with one hand while you hold your drink in the other while walking the Strip."}
{"text":"We saw the line at Earl's Sandwich and was shocked on how long it was going to take, so we decided to walk around. Right outside Planet Hollywood we found this hidden gem and decided to try it out. This is probably one of the best pizzas I have ever had since Village Pizzeria! We ordered one pepperoni and one cheese... then after walking around Planet Hollywood, we went back and got another slice! It's really that good and fairly cheap. Also another plus was that there was no wait!"}
{"text":"Does anyone else notice how the majority of the reviews focus on size rather than the quality of the pizza? My midnight cheese slice has made it onto my worst pizza of Vegas list. Little Caesar's is way better, in my opinion."}
{"text":"I have to say for the price and quantity this slice of pizza was so tasty. The amount of sauce was not overwhelming and the amount of cheese was just right. The pizza was warmed in the large oven on order so one does not get a cold slice. 

The knot was omg!! So delicious!! I could have kept eating more. Thank goodness I only got one. They run about $1 dollar plus tax. 

The options for beers are just ehh, nothing fancy or something I might like/order so I opted for a soda. 

There are NO chairs so expect to stand either inside the location or outside and share a tight counter/ space with other customers. 

The counter faces the cosmopolitan hotel and Las Vegas strip so @ least you'll have a decent view."}
{"text":"YUM! The face sized slices of pizza and the buttery garlic knots really hit the spot at lunch time! We went around 2 PM so there was no line but every other time we passed this place it was packed so be prepared to wait. There isn't seating, just a bunch of counters to stand at to eat. I was hoping to get a to-go cardboard box considering I'd seen pictures of them all over Yelp but the snotty no of an answer from the pinup server told me I was an idiot for asking....my bad. We would definitely come here again for the pizza, not the glowing personality of their staff."}
{"text":"Decent late night pizza that does its job. Big slices offered here. Steady stream of people coming and going.  Garlic knots seemed to be popular with patrons."}
{"text":"Omg this pizza slice is H U G E !!! 
So awesome. Their combo with slice, knot and beer or slice knot and soda is such a good deal. Pretty good pizza. I dig this place and the guys were super friendly. Even posed for a pic to show off the giant pizza and tossing the giant pizza dough!"}
{"text":"I use to only visit this pizza pallor, they had the best pizza and did not hold back on the toppings. It was a flavor burst of Italian pie, after they started to expand and I believe the business is not Corp. They are holding back on the ingredient which leave the flavor very sorrowful."}
{"text":"I have been to Pin Up Pizza a few times now, and I love it. It's excellent. 

A slice of pepperoni is $6.75, and it's worth every penny. The slices are fresh, and they're heated in the oven while you pay, so they're always hot. Lots of flavor. They're huge slices. You're really getting double the slice of a chain slice for the same price. For the price, compared to other eateries in Vegas, it's a really good deal. A combo deal with a garlic knot and a soda is about $10 plus tax, and a couple bucks more if you want a beer. Wait times are minimal and the service is excellent. Be prepared though. It's small inside and draws a large crowd, and the staff takes many orders at once. Please be considerate, pay attention when called on, keep the line moving smoothly, and tip the staff as you leave. They do a great job. 

The space to dine in or outside on the strip is very limited. No chairs. There is a little more room outside, where I like to eat. You can people watch as you eat, which is always fun and entertaining. But if you have a large group of people, you might be better served to get your pizza to go. If one person is paying, you may want to have that person go inside while the rest of the group waits outside. 

Pro tip: Total Rewards credits are accepted here, so if you're gambling at a Caesar's property, you can use your comps here with no hassles. 

If you're looking for an excellent, quality slice of pizza and/or want a quick snack while on the strip, Pin Up Pizza is highly recommended. I just moved here a few weeks ago and imagine I'll be eating here quite often. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great location, right on the middle of the strip in front of PH, good price point, and good product. Would be 5 stars if it wasn't for the rude employee who served us."}
{"text":"Can't beat the price per huge slice of pizza here. Always stop here on our way back from partying."}
{"text":"Had pizza here twice. Both times the cheese & sauce was minimal & much of each slice was dry. The remaining slices in each pie looked the same. This is poor NY style pizza. The slices are large but they are over priced. Many other places in Vegas have much better NY style pizza. But it is open late. This is located at Planet Hollywood."}
{"text":"Grabbed a slice here and it is a great concept of bringing the small New York style   pizza joint to Las Vegas.  The slice was very large.  I ordered a sausage slice and it tasted good. it hit the spot and was tasty.  If you are looking for a late night snack it should do the job."}
{"text":"Very delicious pizza, huge slices. Me and my husband got a combo 10.27 after taxes for a (huge) slice of pizza, a garlic knot, and a pop. The combo fed us both and the pizza itself was very delicious. Plus really great customer service, and were nice to look at :)"}
{"text":"Yummy! The quick ordering for a slice of pizza was definitely worth a try! Right by Planet Hollywood. Walk in, order, wait about 5 minutes, voila--enjoy! The slices are enough for one! The sausage pizza doesn't have enough meat on there and the pepperoni is salty. But once you take a couple pepperonis off, it's all good! There is a little place where you can stand and eat to get a view along the strip, which was pretty cool! Overall, a great place in Vegas for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"This place is is good but they could use some work. Maybe free refills on a soda. And piece of pizza was nice and flavorful but I would appreciate it fresh out the oven slice with the cheese is melting as you eat it instead we had that's nice that they threw back in the oven and the cheese wasn't all melting..."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza worth the price!!! If you are drunk or want a quick slice of pizza this is your place!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for a quick slice and a drink. The slices of pizza are huge. They have a small venue and have bottled beer, wine and water. They only have fountain drinks. Two slices of cheese pizza and 2 bottles of water cost us $22.00."}
{"text":"It was a good size portion and the staff super friendly..the pizza was ok.. But tasted a little salty"}
{"text":"Their slices are like arm length, i kid you not!  I got the white spinach chicken pizza and hubby got the pepperoni. We got the combo so it came with a garlic knot and a drink. Not a bad deal for lunch especially on the strip.  I liked my white pizza better than the pepperoni. Something about the sauce on the pepperoni I wasn't feeling, but over all good pizza. You will definitely be full! they are located right next to PINK'S. There is limited seating, but you really dont need to sit down. Just eat your pizza standing up and watch all the people look and drool at you while they walk by."}
{"text":"I've been stopping by this pizza place each time I visit Vegas for the last few years now. It's way better than Secret Pizza (inside the Cosmopolitan). The slice on its own is big enough to share, but I don't share food...and I ate the whole slice by myself (always do). A slice on its own is about $7, I would totally recommend the combo if you have a big appetite because it comes with a soda/beer and a garlic knot which is just as amazing at the pizza.
There's a counter inside and outside of the place where you can enjoy your pizza with cheese, chili flakes, and hot sauces on the side."}
{"text":"I love pizza and stopping in at Pin-Up was kind of just for convenience because of the great location, but we enjoyed the slices we ordered from Karen. Prosciutto and arugula pizza slices and Bud Lights for each of us ($27.60 total). Pizza was pretty good - not a lot of sauce on it but the crust was semi-crunchy, which I like. 

They have a small patio area where you can eat standing outside, but no tables. Our wait wasn't very long to order so I think we got lucky!"}
{"text":"Located right on the strip and open late. Pin-Up Pizza has yummy, large slices of thin crust pizza. Perfect for those late night drunk munchies! Definitely hits the spot after a night of drinking in Vegas. The line was long when we went around 3AM, but it moved quickly. Will definitely return next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a slice today.   Pizza was excellent. ANGELA? was the cashier and waited patiently for us to decide.  She also answered questions about the place, which is nice in a touristy location.  We had the pepperoni slice.  Excellent sauce, and pepperoni, decent amount of cheese."}
{"text":"Im from the east coast and pizza is a bit different in other parts of the world if your looking for good pizza that are 30 inches like New York and New Jersey this is the place.  However they only sell by the slice.    Check em out super nice people as well."}
{"text":"Great extremely satisfied with there pizza.Staff was very friendly and the young lady was dressed really cute wish the location was bigger"}
{"text":"A nice quick place to get a snack, especially at the odd hours. The only lament is it's already cooked but then reheated. But they are big good slices."}
{"text":"Giant slices of thin crust delicious pizza. There may be better pizzas available in Vegas, but for a slice in 5 minutes they are top tier. 

Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"It's all about the sauce... Well not so much. Pizza looked amazing. Just didn't have the taste to back it up. Waitress was awesome until we needed some more drinks...But overall great personality and was very relatable. Good thing we got to watch some basketball while we waited!"}
{"text":"Let's face it.  There aren't too many GOOOOOOD pizza joints on the Strip.  But then there are slice houses that really get the job done by being open super late at night like Secret Pizza at Cosmopolitan, Pizzeria Da Enzo at The Venetian, and Le Pizza at Paris LV.  Pin Up Pizza at Planet Hollywood fits perfectly into that category.

Unfortunately their late night slice selection is very limited compared to what they have during the daytime.  When I got there for a at around midnight, I went with their All-Meat slice, and one Cheese slice.

Yeah, there's no denying it.  These slices are huuuuuuuuuuuuuuge!!
 http://bit.ly/1v6XLrC

They're around $5-7 a slice, but the enormous size of these slices definitely justify the price and they're pretty good.  Very similar to Secret Pizza's slices in quality.  If you want a whole pie, there's unfortunately no discount.  You just take the price of the pizza slice and multiply it by ten.  So we're basically talking $70 pies!  It's worth it though if you have a big group to feed.

Overall, it's a pretty solid pizza spot on the Strip with enormous slices that are good enough to satisfy your hunger for lunch, dinner, or a late night snack."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan, I personally love pizza!! But idk what it was I just wasn't a huge fan of the pizza."}
{"text":"Never answers phone manager didnt even seem concerned cashier was very nice though I will come back to give then a second chance"}
{"text":"A friend from Hugh school was in Vegas for business.  We had not seen each other in 30 years! With my daughters and wife, we all met at Pin-up Pizza.

We were all impressed with the size of the slices of pizza. But the taste, while not bad, was just that of any other pizza. I've had a lot better, I've had a lot worse.

The garlic knots, lacked the taste of garlic. These knots needed more garlic.

Will we return? More than likely. Prices are good. There is patio seating but it was chilly last night, so we sat inside.

Who knows maybe I will meet up with another high school friend, at Pin-Up Pizza."}
{"text":"We had pizza from here twice during our stay. The first time we had a slice and it was amazing!  We were still kind of hungry so the next time we went back, we ordered 2 slices each.  We could only finish 3 slices.  Garlic knot bread was good.  There is nowhere to sit if you go outside, just a standing bar.  Go inside to the sports bar and there are tables."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews we had to try. The pizza is large but not massive. The flavour is good although the pepperoni was greasy and not that spectacular. The garlic knot was delicious according to my wife. Sadly the service from the girl at the till was poor. She was rude and kept talking down to the rest of the staff. Even if it was the best pizza around I can only give 3 stars due to the rudeness."}
{"text":"Great pizza, served quickly. This place is a tie with Secret Pizza across the street, in my opinion. The $10.99 special for a massive slice, garlic knot, and a beer is a great deal. Highly recommend this place, will be going back when I'm in Vegas again."}
{"text":"Really solid pizza!  The slices are enormous, the prices are fair and the service is friendly and fast.  The garlic knot was pretty good as well.  I had a pepperoni slice (since I'm a sucker for thin crust pepperoni pizza) and I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Apparently this place is popular( I had never heard of it) because there was line out the door upon arriving. That's usually a great sign so I stopped in to see what the fuss was about. I ended up waiting about 30 minutes but it was absolutely worth it. I'll be honest I wasn't expecting much because I am extremely picky with pizza but it was actually good and the slice was large. I purchased the pepperoni but in retrospect I should have gotten one of each(I'm greedy). This will now be a go to spot for me when I return to Vegas."}
{"text":"$10 gets you a drink, a lone garlic knot, and the largest slice of NY style pizza I've ever seen, and it is $10 well spent. Its great, not as good as the nearby Secret Pizza, but you get more bang for your buck here, which puts it in the winners circle for me. The only bad thing i have to say about the place is that there is no seating. At all. However, they did let us sit in the casino bar area, which is accessible via a short hall on the right. Pin Up Pizza is a winner in my book."}
{"text":"The slices are absolutely huge and there are heapings of oils, sriracha, tobasco and spices to help allay the bland taste. Alas, it does not save this pizza from itself. I rather have a slice from Two Bros or Settebello. The size is a neat gimmick though."}
{"text":"I got a slice of pepperoni pizza from here around midnight one night. The pizza, although cold by the time I ate it (my own fault), tasted fresh. The crust was thin but didn't take away from the slightly spicy taste of the pizza itself. The slice was also pretty big and filled me up. I would recommend stopping by if you want some good pizza in a short timeframe."}
{"text":"Around $12 for a huge slice of pizza, garlic knot, and a beer! Service was quick and food was pretty tasty.  One slice is enough for two."}
{"text":"Perfect Vegas gem! Open late night and slices are huge!! Cashier was super friendly and hot!"}
{"text":"Huge slice of pizza for great price!  Really hit the spot, especially if you've had to much to drink.   We ordered some garlic knots and my wife got a slice of pepperoni and I ordered the a chicken spinach with alfredo sauce.  This restaraunt is located right off the strip and easily accessible.  They had about 7 different pizzas showcased to choose from at the moment.  Once you choose a slice, they slide it back in the brick oven to ensure its nice and hot.   Great place to stop by and grab a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Had a slice of pizza, soda, and garlic bun here for 9 dollars. Not the best food in Vegas but when your hungry it's great for the price and definitely a huge portion of food. Check it out when you need some quick but decent food!"}
{"text":"Hype! The slices are big but not as big as they seem to be In the commercial we watched on Facebook or YouTube. The pizza is good - not great not bad just average. We got there at lunch time and only had to wait in line about 20 minutes. The service was good and employees were nice. but it's all hype. you can get better pizza elsewhere."}
{"text":"\"...that's what she said.\"  Yeah yeah, keep the jokes coming because that pizza is MASSIVE!  

Pin Up Pizza is located outside of Planet Hollywood next to Pink's Hot Dog.  It's a small shop with an indoor and outdoor stand up counters to eat.  Pizzas run for less than $6 a slice!  Where they get you is the price of beverages.... $3 for a 16 oz soda?? 

I got the spinach artichoke pizza.  There were huge chunks of artichoke and some spinach scattered around.  It was a little bland but nothing like some Italian seasoning and chili flakes to do the trick.  The pizza holds its form well so you can hold it without worrying about the toppings sliding off from a floppy pizza. Bonus!

Open until 2AM.  Pin Up Pizza is worth checking out for a quick and inexpensive meal that will definitely hit the spot!"}
{"text":"discovered this gem during my last Vegas trip. My sister found it, actually.  She saw a sign about sliced pizza and it lead us here. Everything is pre-made and they heat it up in the oven when you order it. The slices are HUGE! from my elbow to the tip of my middle finger. HUUUUUUGE! Me being the fatass that I am, ate all of it hahaha. It was so gooood! Hot and crispy! The staff is super friendly! very nice and cute! Love their uniforms!"}
{"text":"I come here every trip because their pizza is always hot and fresh. Another reason why I come here is because their portions are huge and sometimes I have hard time finishing 1 slice. It is a little pricey but I personally think it is worth it. So next time your in Vegas and you're craving pizza check this place out."}
{"text":"This pizza was pretty poor. I was unfortunately sober when I came to this place and was able to taste the pizza. It was one of the least tasteful pizzas I've had, however if you're looking for a quick meal during the busy dinner time in Vegas it may meet your needs. I was quite disappointed based on its high reviews."}
{"text":"$6.50 for a slice of sausage and $1 more for a garlic knot.  Both were generously portioned and tasty.  AND, when I say a generously portioned slice, I really mean the biggest I've ever seen.  Great New York style that blows away the slice I had earlier in the day across the street at New York, New York.  Apparently, the dough and pomodorini pelati tomatoes are flown in from Naples, Italy.  The sausage was a real treat as well; classic big gourmet style Italian.

Sounds pricey at $6.50, but it is about 50% larger than your average slice, so you shouldn't be surprised the price is fair in proportion to the size.
 
When you are walking The Strip/Miracle Mile at 3:30 in the morning with one of these in tote, you'll feel like a Vegas stripper walking around topless with the amount of blatant stare downs from every drunkard you pass.  Had to give directions to a couple different groups that decided whatever they were currently headed to was going to be put on hold while they b-lined it to Pin-Up."}
{"text":"The margarita pizza and pepperoni pizza are big huge delicious cheesy slices that you should take a seat so you take it all in. The garlic knots are the perfect side to add on! Def a quick place on the strip that won't break your wallet."}
{"text":"So slow. It's Sunday night but it seems to take 15 minutes to rose one slice!! This place is so horrible!"}
{"text":"Not bad!
I was pleasantly surprised.I went in for a quick slice and really had mediocre expectations. But instead he pizza was good to OK!  I got their Margherita pizza which was bit really classic Margherita by definition. It was a white pizza with fresh mozzarella, grape tomatoes and basil. The crust was good but not life changing, the fresh mozzarella tasted good but was not cut thin enough or spread across the pie. 
Normally this would be a 2 star review but the crew and the decor of the place gave them that edge to a 3 star. 
Would I go back?  Yes. 
Would I tell friends, oh my God, you need to try this place. Not likely. 
Good place in a pinch. But it going out of my way to go there."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever. Great music. Tiny little place but lots of great energy. Pick a slice and they put it back in the oven and hand it to you after you pay. Served hot!  Eat standing up. Huge slices. They prep the pizza in front of you."}
{"text":"How does this have 4 Yelp stars??  The pizza wasn't good by any means.. only edible.  The price was great and the slice huge so there was good potential but it definitely fell short.  No reason at all to eat here with Pink's right next door."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza place located in the planet Hollywood! If you're looking for it from the outside, head to pink tacos and it is located right next to it. If you're looking for it from the inside, you'll see a lit up sign in the sports book section where it leads you to this pizza spot. The slice was HUGE! Service was quick. You can get a pizza slice, huge garlic knot, and soda combo for $10. They heat up the pizza right when you order it to assure you get a hot slice. So yummy!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Sunday night & it was packed! But the line did move reasonably fast. 

I ordered cheese pizza & a garlic bread knot. It was okay, nothing special about the overall flavor. The pizza slices are huge! I believe they only sell slices. It's fresh and hot. 

It's a cute little restaurant & the staff dress in theme which is super cute. The lady who took the orders was amazing. She was fast and super nice.  

The price was reasonable especially for the size of slice you get. If I'm ever in Vegas again, I would for sure stop by again!

There is no seating. More of a take out/take & go place. They do have a little standing area outside of the restaurant where you can stand and eat. 

Overall it's a cool concept. Great late night meal."}
{"text":"Pizza slices are pretty big.  Quality isn't anything special. Staff was rude and would call out the customers who didn't tip. Went because it was super late and most things were closed.  Should have had sandwich place inside PH.  There's a better pizza place at Cosmo."}
{"text":"The pizza slices are the biggest I've ever seen so that was cool but the pizza is ok at best."}
{"text":"I love thin crust pizza so this place was perfect for me. The slices are HUGE!!!! so 1 is plenty and enough to share. This spot is right on the strip next to Pinks and has a standing area where you can people watch and enjoy your slice."}
{"text":"Put their slices in the oven to heat it, still manages to be cold by the time I pay. Being as cold pizza is a good measure of how good someone's pizza is, this isn't spectacular by any means.

Just underwhelming for me. Secret Pizza in the cosmopolitan was much better."}
{"text":"Pin Up pizza was on our list of eats because of the size of the slices. We waited 15-20 minutes to order our slices. The pizza was very good and worth the wait if you have the time, but if you're in a rush, then you may want to move on. The staff was friendly and was trying to move as fast as possible. However, the process could have been much faster if someone assisted the cashier."}
{"text":"I didn't think I'd find NY style pizza in Vegas, but I somehow stumbled (literally... don't ask) into this place.

Slices are huge, fresh, and and tasted amazing. There's no real seating, just a small outdoor standing area, but it's perfect for what it is. I'm a bit of a pizza fiend and I came here twice within the same 12-hour time frame... but it's probably the closest I've come to locating a real NY slice on the west coast. Granted, a slice in NY is $0.99, and $7 here. But it's so worth it. I promise."}
{"text":"2 stars because although the product was good, the quality of service  (the older one who takes the orders) & your pricing is out of line. We ordered 1 slice and 1 combo which I placed myself for the 2 of us.  I asked for a slice that was advertised and added a topping. Since they didn't have it made,  she charged me for a cheese slice and 2 extra toppings, costing me an extra $3 if they would of had it made. Whatever,  I was hungry,  wasn't trying to ruin my mood over $3. But it got worse... she then did the extract same thing to my fiance.  I told her the name of the combo, he told her the he wanted,  although the slice was what they advertised (no change), since it wasn't made she charged him an extra $2.25 and didn't put his garlic knot in the oven.  Get to the register and these 2 orders came out to be $24 (WHAAAA ???) AND no knot?  She proceeds to look at my fiancé and says, \"You didn't order it from me\" with the rudest tone. He said, (pointing at me) She did and I did.  She kept arguing with him.  LOOK LADY, It's a Flippin garlic knot, part of the combo, all ya gotta do is pop it in the oven to heat up! What seems to be your issue?? He says to her,  look, I did because you told this girl (at register) my order and I paid for it. Plus a little extra you inflated. Just give it to me.\" Sheesh!  She finally gave it but with the worst attitude of anyone WITHOUT merit. How hard is it to do your job and be nice to people? The pizza is good, but charging the way you do when you fail to keep your products available is bad business. Charging $73 for a whole pie is stupid ridiculous. You have a good product and you do well only because of this and your location.  People in Vegas blow money like crazy, but that's not a reason to take advantage of your customers and treat them like shit. Although we like your pizza, I would rather spend my money else where so I'm treated with respect and not having my wallet raped.

No recommendation here.  Go to Secret Pizza in Cosmopolitan or New York Slice by Harrah's. Both are just as good, if not better, cheaper and service is 5 Star! Peace!"}
{"text":"This review is for the margherita slice.  It was soooo salty I could only eat around the center (i.e pizza crust). Margherita is supposed to be marinara sauce with mozzarella and basil.  This was globs of thick mozzarella cheese with sour and incredibly salty tomatoes with a dusting of basil confetti. There is NO sauce whatsoever!  I was extremely disappointed and still hungry. 
I will not be back."}
{"text":"This is the worst place I have ever been. Horrible service and management. Literally told the manager on duty how rude the girl was that was taking our order and he acted like it was our fault. Don't go here. It's the pits."}
{"text":"I can't believe this is the same place i glorified 2 months ago.  I was hella excited to get this pizza place that stole me away from earls.  Took my family there was treated rudely by the workers (they weren't even busy) pizzas weren't heated in the oven long enough (the mozzarella on the margarita didn't even melt)

Where did those employees go from valentines day weekend? they made my experience fun and also gave me some good ass pizza.

I guess I will forever be earls faithful from here on out since they're always consistent. Or maybe this is just punishment for breaking my edc diet."}
{"text":"Quick fast and tasty.  We tried the margarita and pepperoni slices and they were pretty good.  The size was huge and boy did they hit the spot. 
The garlic knots look really good.  They offer a combo, huge slice, garlic knot and beer, which seems like a pretty good deal."}
{"text":"Hands down our favorite place to eat in Vegas!!! Pizza is outstanding and the staff are great. This place is great anytime, but even better late at night after an evening on the strip. Our first visit when we arrive to Vegas every time!"}
{"text":"Meh.

With their hours, they're obviously aiming partly at the late night inebriated post-club crowd, probably to compete partly with Secret Pizza.  While these slices may be huuuge, they're nowhere near as good quality-wise as SP.  Now, they're not bad, and can definitely hit the spot if SP may be a bit of a walk/stumble.  This is after having both while sober, so no everything-tastes-better-drunk influence there."}
{"text":"This pizza is bomb!!! Quick and friendly service. Can't wait to come back to Vegas and eat here."}
{"text":"Slices are big and tasty. A bit pricey ($6 for 1 slice of cheese pizza) but it is expected considering it is on the strip. Totally glad I tried it."}
{"text":"We happened to stop in here on our walk over to see the water show at Bellagio.  I like pizza by the slice for a quick and easy meal.  The slices here are the size of three normal slices put together.  They were making fresh pizzas when we walked in and the sous chef was helping us with our order.  The uncut pizza was about 4 feet wide!!!!  I tried the spinach chicken and my daughter got classic pepperoni.  Both were hot and delicious.  Thin crust, fresh, great ingredients and affordable, $6 to $7 bucks.  Enjoy a slice here if you can."}
{"text":"Not really good i didnt liked it...not my taste sorry

Das Pizza Stück war zwar rießig doch der Geschmack war echt nicht gut, habe zwei mal abgebissen und es dann weggeschmissen. Die Location ist allerdings nicht zu toppen direkt am Strip...Deshalb aus gnade 2 Sterne sorry"}
{"text":"If you're from New York, you'll fine this place very disappointing. Long lines for nothing special. Bad thin expensive large slice that taste like dominos. For $6-9 a slice. No togo boxes. This place was bad."}
{"text":"Great pizza by the slice. The slice covers the whole plate. The toppings were tasty and fresh. It's a small store with indoor and outdoor counter tops for dine-in. They offer to go options too. Reasonable prices. Good service. Right on the strip outside of the mall of Planet Hollywood."}
{"text":"Most definitely a fun and different experience. My wife and I have a 2016 rule that we aren't allowed to eat at the same restaurant twice this year and she was craving pizza & we found this gem outside PH. The pizza slices were vastly large and garlic knots were great. $6.50 for a slice & 4 knots for $3. Walked in and there service above par thanks to Leo. I highly recommend at least trying this place out. They're open till 4am. 

The only unfortunate thing is that there's no seating, but it's ok. We're adaptable, so we didn't mind standing and enjoying our meal."}
{"text":"Small joint, but big slices for $7 - you can't beat it. Took about 7-10 min to cook and was on my way. If your looking for quick, good and cheap pizza, GO HERE!!!"}
{"text":"So damn good, after a night of drinks and dancing, this place hits the spot. So good!!! The slices are large, the garlic bread is delicious and the Margherita pizza is amazing. The cherry tomatoes are sooooooooooooooo yummy."}
{"text":"Pizza was good but the customer service is horrible the black girl at the register was extremely rude she got mad cause I didn't leave her a tip on a slice of pizza I will not go there again not worth the attitude plenty of other great pizza place in Vegas with great customer service"}
{"text":"BURNED

This end of the strip seems to be full of New York style pizza places selling slices. You know the type of pizza that Jon Stewart from \"The Daily Show\" thinks is the best pizza in the world. At the end of the day, real pizza comes from Italy and not any American city. I have never truly been a fan of NY style pizza. When I'm in NY I usually only buy a slice because it's cheap, fast and I'm hungry. 

So here I am in Las Vegas and not New York. I was really hungry and needed a bite to eat for my walk home down the street. I stopped in for a slice and they threw it in the oven. It was in the oven for rather a long time. I really wasn't in a hurry as I checked my emails and waited for it. 

I finally got my slice and I decided to bite into it. The problem was that the pizza temperature was set to nuclear radiation heat level. The piping hot cheese stuck to the roof of my mouth and I couldn't get it off in time. All I could think was why didn't the person handing me the pizza slice give me a warning like, \"Hey be careful because it's really hot!\" I didn't think it was hot because my slice looked dried out and there was no steam flowing out of it. A warning or something would have been a nice gesture. I also must take responsibility because I bit into it without thinking twice but I was hungry. 

I ended up with a nasty burn on the roof of my mouth. Luckily the roof of the mouth heals fast. I had to deal with the burn pain for a couple of days. It was annoying and made me have not fond memories of this place every time I ate something in Vegas. 

I really wouldn't recommend  this place unless you were hungry and just looking for a quick and cheap fix. Six bucks for a slice is not a bad deal in Vegas considering how expensive food is around here. I really wished I would have just walked by this location. The pizza wasn't that great just like New York City. If they were going for an authentic NY style pizza, then they nailed it. My only advice is to just check the temperature before biting in or you might get BURNED.

On a side note there are a ton of costumed characters hanging around nearby selling photo opps. It is kind of like a freak show of costumed crazies. These characters are in no way associated with this pizza place but you are going to have to go through this mess to get here. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is NY stile pizza right in the heart of Las Vegas.

Giant, and I do mean giant, slices of Neapolitan, thin crust style pizza for about $6.  Pretty authentic tasting crust and flavor, this is a great place for a quick bite while walking the strip.

Very little in the way of eating area here, so be prepared to stand and eat or just bring it with you.  Drinks are a bit expensive."}
{"text":"Noticed this new pizza place and had to check it out. We each got the sandra d combo which is a giant slice of pizza, garlic knot and drink. I was so excited they had pepsi products as 99.9% of strip places have coke. I got pepperoni and hubby got the meat one with the giant meatball slices. I would of liked to have seen a chicken option or a white sauce but my pepperoni was yummy and I dont eat red sauce or pepperoni usually but I loved it. Kudos to pin up!"}
{"text":"Large thin slice of pizza for $7.  I don't remember the name of my pizza but the toppings were thin gold potatoes, bacon, fresh basil and a white sauce.  I asked for it to be extra crispy!  It hit the spot and I would definitely come back for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, rude cashier. I love when a cashier rolls her eyes at my tip. Sorry Princess, try being a waitress if you want to act entitled to a tip."}
{"text":"We stopped here on a whim just to get something quick between shopping stops. I personally wasn't expecting much--I was definitely wrong. The slices here are HUGE. I mean like, bigger than two adult hands. However, they are a manageable size for one person if you're hungry. My boyfriend went for seconds. The crust is crunchy and there's plenty of cheese (I got the Margherita slice). I enjoyed Pin-Up Pizza's pizza more than the New York New York Pizzeria's. The only problem here is the limited seating, but believe me, it's worth it. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is high quality food and the slices are like 2x the size of Costco and for a great price too!...really recommend it"}
{"text":"A buddy and I waited in line for 45 minutes wanting to order a pizza.  When we finally went to place our order we were told no whole pies because they were busy. Are you kidding?"}
{"text":"Good Food bad service. Line was a long wait and ordered food and paid asked the cashier for it to be in box for I can take it to go and she got mad gave me a attitude and thru all my food in the box. She told me they have a shortage on boxes so don't eat anywhere on property since I got a box."}
{"text":"This has to one of my favorite pizza places when I come to Vegas super friendly staff and pizza is to die for"}
{"text":"This place was so convenient while hanging out at Planet Hollywood. 

$6 bucks for a huge slice of tasty pizza was just what I needed to put something in my belly. 

It was fresh out of the oven, cooked perfect and very flavorful. Service with a smile

I'm a fan"}
{"text":"The pizza slices are HUGE.  Prices are okay, given it's on the Strip.  The staff was very friendly, although they were really busy.  This place must be making money hand over fist, because the line was always 10-15 people deep.  The pizza is pretty good.  Wish the outside 'standing' area where we ate was kept more clean."}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place so bad  after watching the video, but it was disappointing. The pizza doesn't look at all as the one in the video, it was dry and had almost no cheese and the line was too long (45 min wait). Costco pizza tastes way better than this one. The only cool thing about this place is that it's on the strip."}
{"text":"If you're near Planet Hollywood and looking for cheap and delicious pizza, go to Pin Up Pizza. It is located inside Planet Hollywood but can seen by the strip, behind Ringers restaurant which is across from Earl of Sandwich. It is a small shop with stand up tables with a nice view of the strip. If you are just ordering slices (not combos), you can eat inside Ringers. 

The pizza is very good and a great deal for being on the strip. Each slice is huge! They are 15\" long. I tried the Margherita pizza and it was very delicious! The tomatoes are seasoned well and go well with the mozzarella. The Sandra Dee combo is the way to go!! You get any slice of pizza, a garlic knot (YUUUUM), and drink, all for $9.50. Try it out if you're close by!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to Vegas, I have to have a slice from here! I don't know if me being drunk and it being 2 am had anything to do with my judgement. But this place made a good impression on me lol. I like that it's a nice thin slice pizza and it's two feet long lol. I wish you guys had one in Los Angeles. Oh well. just have to wait until my next drunk adventure in Vegas"}
{"text":"The rudest experience ever!!! First n last time coming here nothing special at all 7 bucks for a slice of pizza that's so thin and bland!!! Take your money else where the cashier with braids needs to go she is so rude and clearly doesn't know what customer service is if your having personal issues leave that home she was the most bitter cashier I've ever encountered very very unfriendly rude and rushed me and my bf never again"}
{"text":"You can NEVER go wrong with there Margherita pizza. Nice size slices & the bread knots are great too.. enjoyed it very much.."}
{"text":"This is one of those places that the food tastes add good as it looks. As pizza is one of my greatest food kryptonite I had to try it out... boy was I pleasantly satisfied. The slice is huge, you look at it and think \"I can easily share this\"... but don't, eat it yourself it's too good to share. The crust has a nice crunch to it, over sized pepperoni and a nice think layer of cheese make this the perfect \"on the strip, quick bite to eat!\""}
{"text":"Just in full disclosure, it was late when we visited Pin-Up Pizza.  We had also just had another slice of pizza across town (Secret Pizza at Cosmopolitan Hotel).  So with that...I felt like my slice here was just meh.  I certainly ate it, but it wasn't anything special or memorable.  I don't feel encouraged to recommend Pin-Up Pizza to friends visiting Las Vegas.  With so many great spots in Vegas for food...I think you can do better."}
{"text":"Usually the best pizza experiences happen after you've just left a club and had too much to drink. However, we came here on a Friday, sober, to grab pizza and beer.  

The pizza was delicious! Pick the slice you want abs they will warm it up for you!!!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place to go to if your drunk. I wasn't too impressed with the flavor. It tasted a little dry to me. It was a good place to try out, but never again."}
{"text":"1 star because of horrible customer service. I understand you can have bad days, but learn to control your emotions at work. The girl who served us was the cashier who was tatted up and she was not having it today. We heard the pizza was good here so we decided to order almost one of every slice to see what was good. The food was okay, but it doesn't make up the cashier's horrible attitude. At first I was like maybe she doesn't like asian guys, but NOPE she was just rude to everyone that walked in. Was a straight prick to every customer and had so much attitude and sass I regretted ordering and dining in here. Management seriously needs to check up on her behavior... This is straight up something I would see on a tv show like kitchen nightmare with horrible owners. No need to come back here for mediocre pizza. Take your business elsewhere to SECRET PIZZA instead in Cosmopolitan."}
{"text":"Not the worst I've had. It was in the running for best in Vegas; in it's first year. That was back when Secret Pizza hit the scene in Vegas and became the only spot on the strip for reasonably good pizza. Along came Pin Up. The first two times I ate here I thought it was more authentic and certainly a better bang for your buck with their gigantic slices. Then a year or so later I stopped by and only got through maybe 1/3 of a slice. It was so salty I could not continue eating. I wrote a review about this experience.

Upon seeing that review the manager reached out and requested that I return for another try and that it was something in the sauce recipe that created the saltiness. Explanation but no suggested remedy. 

About a year later I returned on business and went in for another shot at what used to be a great slice of pizza and of course the corrected sauce recipe. It was not correct. In fact it was saltier than ever. Let me point out that I have no aversion to salt; none whatsoever. Unfortunately some things are extreme, others are simply a mistake. The salt content of these slices is a mistake.   

Pizza is awesome when you're drink and it's late. But sorry, this pizza is inedible due to the mega-salt content, regardless of how crick you may be. Skip this place. Or bring a gAllon of water with you."}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Las Vegas last week, and one night as we were enjoying the strip at night and a few beverages, we happened upon this place (after a brief search for a pizza spot - as we both had a hankering).

The slices were big. the toppings were generous, and the prices were cheap.  They were exactly what we were both looking for.  They have an outside seating area, which was great for people watching on the strip at night.  We would definitely go back!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, especially after a night of drinking. Perfect sized slice for one and flavors are on point. It's my food nightcap when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is great pizza after a night of drinking on the strip, probably not so much without the beer goggles. The Margherita pizza was fresh with a good mix of tomatoes, but would have benefitted from more basil. 

Slices are huge and cheap, perfect for late night grazing."}
{"text":"The pizza was great! And for $7 a slice it beats most places on the strip but the customer service oh it was horrible. So they get 1 star for that service and 5 stares for everything else. It's essentially shut up pay your food and go but don't expect service with a smile."}
{"text":"LOVE!!!

I come from NYC, so I love thin crust pizzas.  These pizzas are HUGE.  One slice is probably equivalent to 2 slices of regular NY deli slices.

They go for $6 a slice.  The garlic knots here are SOOO good. They melt in your mouth like butter.  They're $1 for one.  They also have deals like one slice, one knot and a beer or fountain soda. 

Def worth the price and the girls behind the counter dress up like Pin-Ups. So pretty! Everyone is super nice too."}
{"text":"Giant slices of thin New York-style foldable pizza to go, served by ladies in adorable retro pin-up girl clothing. Very limited menu (sliders, soda, pizza, beer) but tasty stuff. $6-7 per giant slice of pizza in the basic options: cheese, pepperoni, sausage, chicken & spinach, all meats. The chicken and spinach was really good with a garlic-y white sauce instead of red sauce. Expensive, but everything is on The Strip. Good for late night after-bar street food."}
{"text":"Great pizza full of flavor. This is perfect if your in a hurry and want something fast. Slices are sharable my bf and I finished one together and it was huge crunchy and delish!"}
{"text":"Great place for a late nite bite. Classy, no, but tasty yes! Perhaps is was just the beer goggles, but this pizza was life changing for myself and the other members of our party. I got the Margherita and my friend wouldn't stop stealing bites when I got up."}
{"text":"Three stars is about right. It's not a bad review, three means \"yay I'm a fan\".   
It was good pizza, made ahead and sliced into very large pieces that they reheat in the oven when you order.  I would say definitely more quantity over quality, and price wise a little high.  I had The Bette P combo which was a little over $11 for a slice, a garlic knot, and a bottle of beer.  The pizza wasn't as hot as I would have liked, but they were jam packed and had a line out the door so I'm sure it was a matter of trying to get the slices ordered in and out quickly.   The garlic knot was really good, very light and airy.   Overall the pizza doesn't really have much topping or sauce for that matter.  A little drier but this place is about the giant slices.  Oh yeah and the pin up girls, which I have no idea what that's all about because there wasn't a single one anywhere the entire time we were here.  Yeah you heard that right, not even one."}
{"text":"Long wait and not a lot of seating but the pizza was pretty good. My only gripe was that the cashier was extremely rude, maybe she was having a bad day or something."}
{"text":"These slices are HUGE!!! It's also right on the strip so it is a good place to stop by for a snack if you are craving pizza. Just your average tasty pizza that is not overpowered by cheese. The down side I had is that it did not look appetizing when I walked through the door. All of the pizza was cold from being out on display. When you order a slice, they just pick up a slice and stick it in the oven to warm it up. It is not a fresh pizza, so being in Vegas, I would recommend eating here for a snack and not a meal. The price was a little over the top but it is Vegas so I am not surprised."}
{"text":"First of all..The pizza was pretty decent. Just getting that part out of the way.

As for the service, it's the worst I've had in Las Vegas. We paid cash, and I noticed we had been charged for three slices instead of two. When I returned to question the girl at the register, she asked for a receipt...obviously, she hadn't given us one. She said, \"I always give a receipt. So if you don't have one, I can't do anything for you.\" I asked to talk to the manager and she told me he was out, and I would have to wait. This chick obviously underestimated how little patience I have for bulls* and how much patience I have to get my money back. I waited. 

The next customer she served didn't get a receipt from her. When I pointed that out, she snapped the receipt out of the register, waves it at the customer, and said, \"do you want this or not?\" The next group ordered three slices and was charged for four. 

She finally looked at me and said, \"so do you want your six dollars, or what? I don't understand.\" Ummmm...obviously. I want my six dollars. I don't care to give my money away to some little troll that's over-charging customers so she can pocket the change. 

This place needs new staff with better customer service skills if they plan to stay in business. And I would strongly recommend background checks on their employees. Especially if the manager doesn't plan to be around to see what they're doing when they think no one is watching.

I recommend just crossing the street to Secret Pizza at the Cosmo. Better pizza, better prices, and no thievery."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this pizza place in Vegas. Each slice is really huge and for $5.25 - $6 which isnt bad. Combo price is $8.99 with soda and garlic. The pizza isnt that greasy compared to the other pizza places ive been to. This place is at a convenient location on the strip."}
{"text":"The pancetta and mushroom and margherita pizza are TO DIE FOR. They use real pancetta and I believe portobello which makes for a tasty thing for the first one. And the margherita uses colorful cherry tomatoes and actual mozzarella sprinkled with herbs. They're both just so delicious!"}
{"text":"The pizza was eh. Their location is in Planet Hollywood so expect to wait in line since there's so much foot traffic, service is quick and slices are big but the taste just missed the mark. Prices are fair for what you get and they do offer combos, there's limited seating inside since the location is so small."}
{"text":"We saw this place featured on insider food so we decided to check it out. They featured huge slices of pizza. It is located outside of the miracle mile shops in between planet Hollywood hotel and casino. 

When we got there, there was a line out the door, so we knew it had to be good. I came to learn there was only one girl behind the counter handling everyone. She handled herself pretty well considering the crowd. Hopefully this was a short staff day and not a normal thing. The line could have gone way faster if there were two ppl taking orders. 

They were also out of garlic knots until later that night so some ppl were disappointed. I didn't really care about them though. The only thing is the pizzas were big but not as big as the ones featured on insider food. I was greedy and selected the biggest one they had from the slices. You can also order a whole pizza if you want. 

I got the margarita pizza. I liked their spin on it and the sauce the tomatoes was in was delicious. It was very flavorful. I had her reheat my slice to crispy and it was perfect. I was satisfied with my visit."}
{"text":"Not so hot!  Pizza was ok, not worth $6.75 a slice.  2 slices & 2 waters were $24. Then the girl at the register dared to ask us for a tip, sorry a tip is earned not automatically implied! (Especially when you don't have utensils to eat the big slices or boxes to take it to go) You can get a lunch buffet for less than that! It's Vegas, not Sicily! !"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a piece of pizza. $6 for a huge slice of pizza. My spouse and I shared the pizza and a drink for a late night meal under $9 cannot beat that. The staff was friendly at first but then got distracted as another coworker came in and started talking to the other guy. Overall I would return if in the mood for a pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza was really good, it hit the craving for something delicious, cheesy and fast. The garlic knots and pizza slices are both huge. A garlic knot is close to the size of my fist and a slice of pizza is bigger than my face. I wanted to go back after trying it, but we simply didn't have the time."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza... huge slices... every time I come to Las vegas I gotta come here for a late night grub.. come check it out.."}
{"text":"I dropped by here while I was in Vegas for my roadtrip. I came here with a dear friend who is a Vegas local. He had never been either, but saw the equally enticing videos on Facebook and Youtube. We honestly didn't know what to expect or where it was. We parked and walked around the little area of the strip where the navigation was telling us to go. Someone pointed us in the direction. It's a little setup that you can see from the street. It is VERY tiny and there is a little setup right outside the exit to stand and eat. We waited in line about 15 minutes so not crazy long. The line did intimidate at first, but we were really hungry. I got a slice with a garlic knot and a soda. He got 2 slices and a soda. It came to around 30 I believe which for the strip, I don't think is terrible. I got standard cheese. He got some different combos. The girl are the register was really nice. There was another girl who I think may have been new and seemed a little frustrated, but it didn't put us off getting our pizza. 
We got a little shoulder to shoulder with other people cramming pizza in their mouth holes. I was really all about that garlic knot and I recommend getting more than one because that shit was delicious. Our slices were massive and really yummy. I feel like if you want something that is solid, will hit the spot, and maybe soak up the alcohol in your belly-this is the place you go to. I am really happy with it and would come back and will recommend to friends and family. I like that you can fold the slices-more like NY style. I know that's not for everything, but it was really yummy. Definitely get the garlic knots!"}
{"text":"These pizza slices are huge. I split one slice with my bf and we ordered 4 garlic knots. The chicken spinach pizza was really good and combined with the garlic bread it was enough for us to be full. Wish our slice had a little more chicken on it but it was still really good. A little on the only oily side but it's pizza. The garlic knots I have no complaints! Make sure to buy dipping sauce to go with it. Yum! 

Disclaimer: yelping from a jet blue flight back home right now--so cool!"}
{"text":"Pin-Up Pizza is A-ok for me! It's right off the sidewalk outside of Planet Hollywood so it's definitely convenient. That's one thing that Secret Pizza can't claim. The female staff is also decked out in classic pin up attire which is another added bonus. As if that wasn't enough, the slices are probably the largest single slices of pizza that I've ever had! Even though the price point which is in the $5-6 range is the same as most other pizza by the slice places on the strip, for me, the best quantity value goes to Pin-Up! The actual flavor of the pizza is very good as well. It's crust just happens to be more on the average to above average side and that's why they get only 4 stars. For me, the best crust and best overall pizza goodness goes to Secret Pizza but that's not nearly as convenient and their slices are about 20% smaller. I'd definitely come back to Pin-Up pizza if for no other reason than just to see the cute girls working there and have a good ole' slice right in the heart of the strip. Not a bad deal!"}
{"text":"HUGE and DELICOUS slices at very REASONABLE PRICES.  I went back the very next day.  Only downside is they don't have inside seating, although you can easily slip into the Sports Book for Planet Hollywood Casino and find a place to sit..  Margherita Pizza was my favorite.  Staff was friendly.  They apologized for my slice taking a little extra time.  I didn't even notice and thought it was delivered quickly.  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite late night take out on the Strip.
Located on the Strip at Planet Hollywood this NY style pizza is A+.
While you wait in the long line that moves relatively quickly you are entertained by trying to guess the pin ups ranging from Jane Mansfield to Rhiana. The pizza is par baked in a brick oven and then when you order it they stick your slice on the oven. By the time you pay it is ready. Genius. Last night we had a slice of pepperoni, margarita, and prosciutto with mushrooms. The margarita was my favorite. It was loaded with grape tomatoes that had been marinated in a vinaigrette and married perfectly with the fresh mozzarella. 

If you are looking for a late night take out bite this is totally it."}
{"text":"This place is a solid option if you happen to get hungry for pizza around Planet Hollywood. Aside from the massive slices, there is really nothing special about the pizza, but if pizza's what you want, this will definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were extremely disappointed in the quality of the pizza. All we wanted was a slice of pizza, and what we got was overly salty bread with little ingredients. The biggest disappointment was the menu listed on yelp is outdated by two years! They lacked veggie options, and their margarita pizza was just tomatoes (although heirloom cherry tomatoes were used) and sliced mozzarella with no tomato sauce leaving areas of the pie with no ingredients- and on a large slice it's a lot of empty space. The pizza was so salty we couldn't even finish our slices and we needed to drink lots of water after. Even writing this review after the facts my tongue and lips are tingling just due to the amount of salt used. I would never recommend this place and if someone wanted a slice I would recommend Sbarro inside of Planet Hollywood."}
{"text":"Do you like dinosaur-sized pizzas served by pin-up beauties? Well I do! 

Then after the pin-up girl serves you your order, do you like to \"people-watch\" on the Las Vegas Strip? Well I do! 

Watching strangers try to walk and be drunk at 11:30am on a Saturday is extremely funny while eating our ginormous pizzas. 

I had the Margherita pizza and my wife had the same. We also kept ogling at how our pin-up pizzas could cover our faces.

Pair the pizzas up with a Fat Tuesday drank and that combo is FTW! I also love dhow The crust was so crispy! 

Pin-up pizza is an experience. Order it, have fun with it and then hit up the casino."}
{"text":"Definitely large slices. It's the best pizza I've tried but still very good and convenient if its late since not many restaurants or food joints are open late. And not too expensive either, only $6.50 plus tax for a pepperoni slice. The line can get pretty long but it goes fairly quick. I like their $9 combo which included a slice of pizza, a garlic knot, and soda, pretty good deal. The only thin i wish there could have been was tables. All they had was this little table/bar stand to place your plate, but considering how popular that place it, they definitely need more. I had trouble locating it at first, but was able to find it since i remember seeing it while driving, which its outside right next to Pink's Hot Dogs.

There were a few different toppings. I saw some of them with salami, only cheese, another with no sauce with tomatoes and fresh mozzarella cheese, and even chicken with spinach. 

I'd recommend to try it!"}
{"text":"The staff was friendly. The pizza slices are huge. Thinner crust with a nice crunch on the bottom. I want to come back to try the garlic knots which looked pretty awesome slathered in butter and parsley flakes."}
{"text":"Decided to grab a slice after the O show. Went with the chicken & spinach pizza and a garlic knot. The pizza was hot and a bit crunchy. I really liked the spinach on it. The garlic knot wasn't bad.

Will come back and try the margherita pizza or something else."}
{"text":"Oven fired pizza. Crust is most excellent flavorful and thin. It's a very small joint that you enter one door and exit the other. Great value for the money. Definitely splurge and get the garlic knots they are well worth it!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located around the Planet Hollywood area, reasonably priced specials, large slices, fast takeout service, and friendly service. Open late, until 4 AM. Very tiny spot, and if a line were to form, it could not accommodate it. At best, could not fit more than 6 people. Would not recommend eating here, even if there is a standing section by the window to eat/people watch. Can be uncomfortable with people coming and going in such a cramped space. 

Came here for a hearty bite that I didn't have to wait long for: heated it up, boxed it in their giant slice box, and I was on my way. 

Plain cheese slice: Thin crust, and perfectly balanced sauce and cheese ratio. 
$6

Margherita slice: Yum, so good! Didn't have a lot of sauce, or cheese, but it was OK, since too much of either would not have mixed well with the roasted tomatoes on top. Delicious and colorful, as the tomatoes were red, yellow. Enjoyed the acidic punch. Wasn't much basil on it though.
$6.75

Garlic knot: was the biggest disappoint. Not sure what kind of roll they used, but it was soft, and lacked any kind of bite or chew to it. Felt like a cheap store bought potato roll that they slathered some butter on. Didn't even have any garlic taste to it either. If they're going to try to pass off a dinner roll as a garlic knot, at least use some freshly cooked garlic on top! Didn't even finish the one knot I had, and my husband who loves bread and butter, didn't even bother eating the piece I couldn't finish. 
$1.25 for single/ $3.25 for 4

Overall, still worth a visit, because they have affordable combos here:

Bettie P. Combo- slice, knot, beet for $11.75
Sandra D. Combo - slice, knot, soda for $9.75

As other Yelpers have said, it's not cheap, but nothing on the Strip is. In comparison, this is probably one of the cheaper options, considering the slices are very long. I would estimate at least a foot if not a bit longer! Also sell cannolis, an assortment of soft drinks, bottled water, beer. 

Was really glad I came here for dinner!"}
{"text":"Huge a$$ slices.  Decent taste and decent service.  Price wasn't too bad considering it's on the strip"}
{"text":"Where have you been aLL my Life?? 
After our super duper Long waLk aLong the strip, hunger finaLLy struck and we just so happened to be waLking into PLanet HoLLywood. The amazing aroma coming out of this pLace is to die for and we didn't hesitate to make a Quick detour. 

Pin Up Pizza is a teeny tiny shop offering up deLiciousLy GiNORMOUS sLices of pie!!! 
Located in PLanet HoLLywood, right next to Pink's Hotdogs, this LittLe gem is a Life saver during those Late Late night munchies.

Here's the rundown:
No the customer service was not good, in fact, it was pretty bad. They were rushing everyone and they seemed grumpy. That being said, it was Late and super busy so I'm sure they just wanted to get the Line moving.
Pie is 15 inches Long @ $7 a pop. The menu offered during the day seems a Lot more vast than what was being offered at night but that didn't bother me.
& ALthough this isn't the best pizza I've had, the aroma is neckbreaking good. We were stopped by muLtipLe peopLe about where we bought this from and how they HAD to try it!!! 

FYI: if you want an order of wings, you have to order it at the Ringer (bar)."}
{"text":"Pizza and knot was good but the service was so shitty. Like if you want a combo, tell them ahead of time. They should have a sign that says that or the girl doing her job, which is not too hard putting pizza in the oven and box, should have asked ahead of time. Instead of being rude to the customers and being cunt faces, they should ask. Be lucky to have a job. Maybe if you could breathe in your corsets, you wouldn't be fat bitches."}
{"text":"The perfect place to visit after a night of drinking and gambling on the Las Vegas Strip.. this is a hole in the wall kind of place.. nothing fancy .. just good cheap pizza!

There was a line out the door at 2am.. the line moves fast.. pizzas are pre-made and slices are  thrown in the oven as you order and heated up giving the crust a nice crunch

I had the spinach & chicken .. crust was really good! Toppings were plentiful .. the bf had the big meat slice and he also commented on the crust be really good .. ($7/each).. the slices are huge.. 

The service was fast and the cashier knew how to work the line.. friendly & efficient! 

You take it to go or you stand outside and chow down.. would definitely recommend to someone looking for cheap good eats on the strip.. if you need table service or a place to sit down go somewhere else"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend after 1 am or so, and I really enjoyed the experience. This is a really cute outlet on the Las Vegas strip right by Planet Hollywood. The pizzas are huge which means that the slices are also just as big! I couldn't even finish my slice but, I devoured it when I got back home because it was absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"I came here the other day. They just opened. I really like the pepperoni. The pizza slices are huge enough to share which I what we did. They have siracha to which I love. And it's pretty cheap on 6 bucks which is good considering it's on the strip. And they have outdoor seating by pinks"}
{"text":"As seen on Youtube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inZkSfKVyDY

Ok, the slices are \"big\" (bigger than most pizzas), but not at big as they look in the video; they probably just used a small model. Anway, the pizzas, getting their novelty from their size are not that great. Most of the flavors are pretty basic, with a few more interesting flavors. It's a small shop where you order in line and grab your slice after a minute or two of them heating yours up in the big open oven they have right in the ordering/kitchen area. 

I'm not really a pizza person because they're just kind of peanut-butter and jelly (boring), and this pizza didn't really change my mind from that. It's about the same as most pizza I've had, kinda crunchy, not much sauce, and a bit oily from the cheese and other toppings. It's alright for a quick bite if you're nearby, but there's certainly other food on the strip that's more fulfilling (and filling), for probably about the same price. 

I'd say it's not really worth it, but then again, for me most pizza isn't worth it. If you want the novelty of a slice it won't set you back very much but you're probably better off getting something elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great location, quick service when u want to eat and walk. Fair prices for huge slices. Kids love the size."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza. Jersey rated!!! Big slices, open late, friendly staff and did I mention giant slices!!!! I got pepperoni and chicken spinach white pizza, which as excellent. This place will be my new late night staple when in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place was so gooooood!
My kids are picky about pizza, pizza sauce etc.
And my kids loved it, it was very good, 
Huge slice and the garlic buns things were great. 
Going to come here every time we come to vegas."}
{"text":"The pizza is excellent, service is fast and good most of the time. Convenient they are open til 4 am as well"}
{"text":"Pretty solid slice of pizza that you get within 4-5 minutes of ordering. They sell soda, beer and wine too. Worth the price as it's fast and they finish it hot in the oven for you. I wouldn't make a special trip to the Strip for it but not a bad quick option if you're in the area."}
{"text":"After seeing this pizza place on FB, we had to try it while in Vegas. There was a line and we had to wait about 10-15 mins which I didn't have a problem waiting. It was kinda exciting just being there and watching the guy toss the dough and we met some really fun people while standing in line! The chicken and spinach pizza was really good, much better than I expected after reading other reviews. The staff was really nice and polite. If you like pizza then go check out this spot. It's a cool experience! Being that we are in Vegas often, I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in Vegas!!! The slices are huge. It taste even better when you are tispy..lol"}
{"text":"Grabbed a few slices at Pin Up Pizza since we were staying at Planet Hollywood, shortly after we arrived on our first night in Vegas.  They were huge slices but our eyes were bigger than our stomachs and we ordered 3 slices to share between the two of us.  We got pepperoni pizza and a cannoli.  Unfortunately, the pizza tasted overly like garlic and grease.  There is no mention of garlic on the pizza, but it's clearly in the sauce, and a lot of it.  We both ate one slice, because we were hungry, and threw out the other one.  I was excited to try the cannoli but took one bite and spit it out.  The cream inside is flavored with what tasted like orange liqueur, and again, a lot of it.  Cannolis are not traditionally filled with orange liqueur flavored cream, so a heads up before buying would have been nice.  Would not recommend this place to anyone.  We didn't get a chance to try Secret Pizza across the street on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan, but I'd say it's gotta be better than here."}
{"text":"The slices are huge and affordable! The Margarita pizza was surprisingly good and the garlic knot was soft and buttery. The workers are rude- you can tell they hate dealing with all the drunk people."}
{"text":"I am your #1  DUKE right now the daytime Chef and crew & nighttime shifts are Awesome and the women are Very Beautiful and very nice. They told me that you read your yelp reviews every day let this one stand out you have a awesome crew day and night."}
{"text":"Noticeable decline since my last visit in May.  I visited twice, since I had a dining credit from PH.  The first time it was obvious the pizza had been sitting for a while.  Ended up throwing out 1/4 of the slice.  Decided to try again the following day for lunch, figuring the slices would be fresh.  Pizza was better, but still tasted very processed.  I had mentioned I wanted my order to go and when it came out on a plate, the employee seemed annoyed that I asked for a box instead.  No offer to cut the slice in half like they used to.  If you're staying on-site and looking for a cheap place to grab a quick bite before a show, this place does the job."}
{"text":"Not the best, not the worst pizza. Nice large slices, good for the cost. Quick service, good atmosphere. The pizza just wasn't that great. The taste was a bit off, the flavors just didn't really meld together well; some adjustment to the recipes and it could be good pizza. Since it's twice baked, crust was hard."}
{"text":"After walking all the way here from Mandalay, and not having supper, I was starving. Good news...Pin Up is open real late. I ordered two slices; a pepperoni and a chicken and took it out to the patio to watch the people walk by. It was fun. It was $14 for two slices though, but they were huge. Still, it was worth it as the pizza was pretty decent."}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious and didn't have to wait in line too long. However, one of the employees'(older girl with glasses and tattoos) attitude wasn't pleasant. They need better customer service."}
{"text":"Personally, I don't believe there is such a thing as bad pizza. So I probably wouldn't give any pizza place a bad review. I came to pin up because of the videos I had seen on Facebook.. Yes, the slices are big. But they're nothing to write home about.  I really wanted to try the garlic knots but they had run out. Also the line and wait times were pretty long for pretty normal pizza. I would save my time and just go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Uh-may-zing. This place has some good pizza and way better than the price of the expensive restaurants on the strip. If your look for a quick bite to eat with your drink, this is the go to place! Super cheap and the best part you can share it! You can't go wrong with a $6 piece of pizza that can easily feed two people. Try the pepperoni pizza and you won't be disappointed. 
While your there, eat outside and you can enjoy all of the fun characters walking around or live entertainment by street performers"}
{"text":"What can i say about this place?? Its pizza, a giant slice of pizza! Overall the combinations of pizza were great! Not to saucey yet still alot of flavor! Only bad thing about this place is the wait. But what can you expect from being a restaurant on the strip. Although it was fairly fast they only had 2 people working. But, i will definitely come back for a slice in sin city."}
{"text":"Worth the wait!

The lines can get a little long during peak hours but don't let that keep you from going. 
                                 
The staff at Pin Up Pizza were friendly and timely. It's a quick in and out once your inside.
                                           
The pizza is some of the best that I've had. I'll definitely be going back the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Huge slices. Perfect crust. The staff was fun and friendly. Fast service despite being super busy."}
{"text":"OH MY GIANT SLICES. 
Pretty tasty, accessible, variety of pizza slices and pies to choose from, and awesome carry out box= what else could you ask for when you're starving in Vegas and need something ASAP?
Next time I go, I'm getting a garlic knot. No questions. I looked longingly at them around 12:30am one night and decided against getting any, which I sorely regret. They, like the pizza slices, were giant. And no one was skimping on garlic butter & cheese on those babies.
See you in September, Pin Up!"}
{"text":"Diffidently the Largest slice I have seen on the strip.    They are also friendly with cute pin up dressed girl."}
{"text":"Eh, I don't see what the hype was about. We wasted 10 minutes trying to find this pizza place only to be left disappointed. The slices are huge but they lack flavor. The garlic knot was horrible. I took one bite and spit it out. My husband got the meat pizza and it smelled rotten. I was really excited to try this place because they offered a great deal but I won't be back. I should have went to NYNY for pizza like we originally planned."}
{"text":"This place!!! The pizza slices are huge and definitely very cost effective option on the strip. The line is usually long but quick! The wait time is mainly cooking up new pies. I high recommend it!"}
{"text":"Slices are huge. Combo of slice of pizza, garlic roll, & soda are a great deal. Employees are super helpful with suggestions. Part of Planet Hollywood casino so I took my food just a few steps away into their sports book & watched games while I ate"}
{"text":"this slice was delish and definitely worth the walk at 2 am!"}
{"text":"Items Selected:

Margherita Slice
Garlic Knot

...with my opinions on traditional New York \"slice shops\" varying from terrible to merely decent but having found some improvement in the style since relocating to Las Vegas, largely as a result of superior ingredient quality at both \"Secret Pizza\" and Pop-Up, it was with cautious optimism that I approached the newly minted Strip-side Pin Up Pizza at pH's Miracle Mile Shops for a late afternoon bite.  Truly a \"slice shop\" featuring a small counter with standing room only dining both inside and out plus a half-dozen pies served by a staff of four including two servers, a cashier, and a pizzaiolo hand-tossing gargantuan crusts it was to warm smiles and pleasantries that I was greeted and taking my time to peruse the options and inquire what was most fresh an order was placed - a seemingly steep $6.76 after tax, but on closer inspection a price well justified by a baseball sized garlic knot and locally sourced heirloom tomatoes on what I'd argue to be the city's best electric (or gas for that matter) crust, though purists may beg to differ given a lack of \"foldability\"...or perhaps \"fold-necessity\" as relates to greasy, flavorless 'tradition.'  Subtle with semolina but largely a lightly yeasted flour base with just enough spring and char to support the ingredient weight from rim to a center approximately one foot away suffice it to say that single slices at Pin Up will eat like a meal to some, but with dollops of fresh mozzarella playing against fresh sliced tomatoes and a drizzle of olive oil on such an impressive backbone with only pre-filled $3 cannolis for dessert I'd say that's just fine...besides, knowing what I know now I rather wish I'd have stuck around to try a slice of the housemade pepperoni with shredded fresh mozzarella and hand crushed tomato sauce instead of schlepping to MGM for dessert anyhow."}
{"text":"Hungry? Near Planet Hollywood? Low on cash because the craps tables were cold as ice? Make a stop at Pin Up Pizza.  Very good pizza and very affordable.  $12 for a slice and a beer.  Margarita pizza is the best.  Nice employees and service is fast.  You can use your total rewards points here."}
{"text":"Delicious. Friendly. Huge slices of pizza. Will be back when we are back in Vegas. Watching the guy make the pizzas was entertaining in itself. I mean, he was a pro at throwing a 30\" pizza dough in the air. Cool spot, friendly service, delicious slice WINNING!!"}
{"text":"Pizza is just ok.  Slices are big and it's convenient.  But no where to sit and only average food."}
{"text":"Pizza is awesome!!! just one slice & it hits the spot. Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"What an awful experience.   The inside is about 20 feet long.  It is a door on one end that goes into the casino one in the middle that is the entrance and the other end is the exit.  I felt like I was in someone's way the whole time.  The chick behind the counter was busy chatting to another employee about a text message.  My husband ordered a combo with an extra slice of pizza.  She asked if it was here or to go.  I don't know why they don't just put it in a box.  She smacked our slices on plates smaller than the pizza and stared at us.  I said didnt he order me a soda?  She said i dont know.  Well he did because he ordered a combo with an extra slice.  So then i get my mountain dew and garlic knot (which she just dumped on top of my pizza) and my husband asks for a glass of water.  She made an awful face and made a glass of water.  So then we paid for a second time since we only paid for the pizza the first time.  There is nowhere to sit inside the casino and nothing outside but a stainless steel counter with no seats.  Since I am not a sea gull we had to walk with our giant flopping slices of pizza through the casino and out into the mall to find a table to sit at.  The pizza was nothing special.  I do not recommend going here for any reason.  It was a terrible experience."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness!!!!! This pizza....!!!!! Giant slices. Margherita is the best. Ate there for lunch our first day. Then made it back our last night and couple of minutes before they closed at 2 am. I was hustling after hoping off the Deuce to make it. It's that good!!  Don't worry when you see one small counter top to stand at inside and a few outside. Just to the right of the front door is the bar inside the Planet Hollywood. Lots of tables in there. You can grab a seat there"}
{"text":"The service was HORRIBLE, I got the chance to see her name tag it said \"Stacy\", a guy asked her \"can I have a container for sauce\" she's like \"No there isn't any\". She was so rude to him. I felt intimidated to ask but I asked \"is there chicken and spinach\" and she's like \"NO\" once again very dry, very rude. Once we were waiting for our slices to warm up. I asked her \"excuse me, where are the lids for the cups\" & she's like \"I don't have any\" .. I was like OMG this girl hates her job, and is making the buisness look bad, I can guarantee people will not be back because of the horrible customer service. She could've said \"no we ran out, sorry\" or something along the lines...but she's dumb. Oh and she had long hair and it was let down, which means it can very easily get on the pizzas. Will not come back. I am not from Las Vegas and I regret wasting my time and money there, even tho it was inexpensive; the pizza is big, but dry, nothing special in the sauce. Garlic knots lacked garlic."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab a snack or dinner.  I was in the mood for a slice and I'm glad I stopped here!

Staff was friendly and the pizza was outstanding.  The slices are huge, so make sure you got some room!

Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! Great size for a single slice. Very nice staff. Would have liked more seating, but was a good quick bite."}
{"text":"I have never had such a Negative experience at a Pizza place. I was so excited to go to Pin-Up Pizza today. I watched an insider video on FB. I've been telling my friends about trying the Chicken and Spinach pizza. When I got in line I requested for the Chicken and Spinach toppings and the brunette girl said \"we don't have it yet\" so I said I'll wait, she said it'll take awhile. I then opted for a mushroom one. She put it in the oven and the pizza man opened the oven with the chicken and Spinach. So I said, can I exchange it because the one I want is right there. We didn't even pay yet and it was already on display. Eva the cashier was so rude and said, you have to pay for both. My father works at Aria and they never treat customers this way. Even the customer in front of us recommended that we Yelp the incident for management to review their employees attitudes. The 2 people behind me got the chicken and spinach and I was left with the mushroom. Horrible service. Please check on your employees attitudes. They can be replaced. Before all of this happened and before I ordered, I was going to come back again to try other flavors. Remember I came to this place to try the Spanish & Chicken pizza and I did not even get that. Now that I'm thinking about it, I don't think I am going to come back here again.

For those who are reading this and is planning about going here, it is not worth the wait nor your time. The small brunette girl burnt my garlic bread (look at the photo I posted) and didn't bother to replace it. I didn't see that she burned it because she packed it in a box so fast. None of the employees and I mean none of them said one simple word, \"Sorry.\" Again, I was so excited to go to Pin-Up Pizza, but Eva and the small brunette girl ruined my whole experience."}
{"text":"Best place to go if you're  DRUNK. Never knew cardboard could tastes so good... At 5.88 a slice real, bargain here in Vegas, lol wasn't even worth a picture I'm certain  y'all know what pizza looks like."}
{"text":"Pin-Up Pizza is an adorable little pizza shop located  right outside Planet Hollywood on the strip! It's very small, and has barely anywhere to eat so I suggest getting your slice to go!

The atmosphere/decor/vibe: Its small, quaint, and simple. You come in, order your slice and enjoy! It's high pace in there though because of how many people are all trying to get pizza at once. So don't expect to gradually order. Everyone is pretty friendly and of course it's a clean environment!

The Service: The girls are all dressed up in cute Pin-Up outfits! They are nice for the most part, a little abrupt but it makes sense as to why. It's hot in there, some customers are very demanding and it's a small space with huge ovens emitting a bunch of heat.

The Food: There are not very many pizzas to choose from but everything there is delicious! The sauce is very unique and the pizza slices are giant. I truly wish I had the stomach to eat more than one slice, it was so delicious! It's a little expensive, but what isn't expensive in Vegas? Also, no gluten free options :(

Overall: I love this pizza, I wish it was a bigger space but for what it is, it's good! I will always come back here every time I visit Vegas & I highly recommend any pizza lover to stop in and try a slice!"}
{"text":"one slice depending toppping is $5 - 6.00 but i also get my 10% casino discount. huge slices. everything was made fresh on the spot nothing dirty or cheesy... massive slices of pizza for a small price... saw the review in las vegas weekly but i had to go in. the girls are dressed in pinup look. since when are we in the 1940s ?"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time while visiting Vegas and they got 2/3 of the pizzas we ordered wrong. After confronting them about the pizzas, they told us they knew what we ordered and we didn't. 
I regret even trying to argue with them about it, the pizza wasn't all that. Yeah, the pizza is a very generous size. But the pizza itself isn't that good. I would probably be more satisfied with Papa John's or Dominoes."}
{"text":"Awful food awful
Servers not dressed up in a pin up way at all
Literally nowhere to sit and eat"}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good! There was a huge line but I didn't mind because I've had this pizza before! I had previously purchased a whole box for about $45, I guess they changed that since then it's now sold by the slice, so it comes out to like $75 :( This time I was there it was very uncomfortable because of one of the employees! It was the girl with the glasses and tattoos, she was extremely rude to customers. I get it if a customer is giving them attitude and they respond but this girl was cussing and had NO customer service skills. When it was our turn,after waiting patiently in a hostile environment (she was arguing with a few customers before us) she pointed and said for you? Even the other employees looked uncomfortable because of her attitude. I couldn't wait to get out of there."}
{"text":"Ah, so this is the new kid on the Vegas pizza block. Thanks to Yelp, I bookmarked Pin Up for my recent trip. I missed it the evening while navigating Planet Hollywood and Miracle Mile, so I made it a mission to find it the following day. It was still early when we got there, so we ordered the Sandra D. combo (slice, knot, soda) which is a reasonable deal. As expected, the pizza and slices are enormous. When ordering, the guy expected us to get in two orders and questioned just the one, but honestly, come on, that big @## slice can't be consumed by one person in one sitting. I mean, yeah, sure it can, but with all the good stuff to try in Vegas, we made this a shareable snack before hitting up other places. The pizza was decent though, and the garlic knot was pretty good for its size. Service was quick, especially since we were able to beat the lunchtime rush. We were just a little confused about where to eat the food. It's a pizza joint, so not a lot of space, but it's standing room only inside and outside, or you can follow the corridor leading directly to the PH sportsbook."}
{"text":"OK, the pizza's cheap, and you get a lot for your money, unlike many other places in Vegas.  But come on, people!  No To-Go boxes?  There's no seating and you've got to either leave the store to eat your slice or stand at a bar and eat it, hoping not to get knocked around by people ordering.  Not cool.  

Zero people skills by the two employees, either.  They were an assembly line and efficient, but part of any dining experience is service, even if it's just to throw your slice into an oven and hand it to you.  

I'll go back when I'm really hungry, need something in a hurry that doesn't cost a lot, and feel like eating standing up.  On the plus side, it tasted good.

Was hoping for more, though."}
{"text":"I didnt mind the long line i was really excited to try this famous pizza. The price was alright 10 to 12 bucks for any combo. Once we got to pay was my problem. The cashier gave me attitude and threw my food in the counter just because i asked for a box to go. She said they have a limit on boxes so don't eat in casinos or whatever im like wtf how you know what the hell ima do next after trying this pizza... she don't know if i was hitting the road back home or something. Anyways i didn't like her stupid services just for asking for a box to go and throwing my food like that... soda didn't have enough gas but pizza was bomb with the garlic knot. 
They need to change their staff a lil"}
{"text":"We happened upon Pin Up Pizza last Monday night while roaming around the strip...and after having a very late lunch and a liquid dinner...we thought maybe a slice or two of pizza would hit the spot.

We walked in to the super convenient location right next to Planet Hollywood Hotel/Casino and when we saw the slices, decided to split one between us.

We ordered a straight up cheese slice and wow...sooo tasty!!  We've had the best of the best in NYC and I have to say that this pizza held its ground with some of the better non-NY slices around, including that \"super secret\" pizza place over at the Cosmopolitan (they get a bonus for the video games though haha)

Wish we would have read some reviews and ordered a garlic knot, but hey, now we'll have to go back again during our next Vegas visit!

Overall I'd highly recommend this establishment.  Grab a (huge) slice, hang outside and do some people watching."}
{"text":"\"Bringing New York to Las Vegas\" is what they're about. Huge thin crust pizza slices which was exactly what I was looking for one late drunk night. 

Ordered the pepperoni and thinly sliced meatball pizza slice. Came up to a couple cents short of $8. The crust was crispy and crunchy and had good flavor. Definitely hits the spot when you want a slice of pizza. Service was friendly and super fast. 

The slice was HUGE. Could probably share with another person as well since I was pretty damn full after having the entire slice.

Would I be back? Definitely"}
{"text":"Great location and fast service! Pizza slices are huge and the flavors are decent. Has two entrances and you're greeted with friendly service even in those late wee hours."}
{"text":"Decent pizza that makes up for quality with quantity. You need to eat the pizza here with a fork and a knife... or find a way to finesse a bite without the pizza falling apart. They're huge, but a huge part of it is a massive crust. Pro tip: season your pizza by getting drunk during the evening. It helps the pizza taste a little better. The margherita pizza was the best and that's coming from someone who likes pepperoni and sausage.

So why the one star? The service.

One morning before heading out to the river, my girlfriend went up to the counter to ask when they would open. There were 3 guys behind the counter, each facing the glass, heads down. My girlfriend said excuse me three times. Not once did anyone acknowledge her. I was standing about 6-7 feet away and I could hear her clearly.

Another example of poor service was when I got back one night from the river. I stood in line underneath the \"order here\" sign. The guy making pizza was doing his own thing. Then another guy came out to work on other orders. No one said a word. Other people began to wonder where to order. At that moment, someone walked up to the register and began ordering, even though other people, including myself were waiting at the \"order here\" sign first. I asked where we should order and finally they said I would be next.

The hours of operation on yelp are also incorrect. I believe they close at 10 PM as of July 2017. Anyway, the poor service seems to be a common topic amongst customers. I was able to experience it myself."}
{"text":"It's really good and it's about the only cheap meal you can get around PH, this and Earl of Sandwich. Both are good meals but they are somewhat normal priced. You can eat here for about $10-12 per head with a beverage.

To me the main knock is that there is nowhere to sit down. You typically walk around a lot and want a nice seat when you eat, so we had to get the food and then carry it on two plates up to our room. That aside - great pizza place, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Pizza was pretty good, but the wait was sooooo long and wasn't even during a meal time really. For the price, it's a filling meal. Just wish they could find a way to get through the line quicker."}
{"text":"Not bad not great but decent pizza. They always have real easy to look at servers serving the pizza huge slices and fair prices sometimes the line can be a long one but over all pretty decent."}
{"text":"Good late night snack, but cashier was a bit rude to an elderly customer, big turn off."}
{"text":"Wow. Great pizza! NY style perfect balance of toppings dough sauce everything. Must try the sausage if you like Italian sausage with plenty of fennel. Don't be fooled with their size and think you are sacrificing quality this is a great pizza. Can't wait  try the margarita a little later on."}
{"text":"went here on vacation this weekend and i was super excited to try it because i love pinup! i got a cheese slice and i prefer little caesars or costco pizza over this stuff. people must be REALLY drunk to think its any good! the garlic knots are delicious but not the pizza. the customer service seemed great until i got to the cash register and the cashier was very rude she kept staring at me with this really off-putting look on her face that made me not want to even purchase the food. i believe her name was stefany? a customer came over and asked her a question and she was very rude when she replied. our garlic knot took 10 minutes longer than our pizza? made no sense. a slice is $6 and they're super huge but was not happy with the flavor. i wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Came here after a late night. I was craving pizza but didn't know where to go until a Planet Hollywood casino employee directed me to this fine little jewel. 

    Open late till 2 a.m. M-Th & till 4 a.m. Fri & Sat this is the perfect munchie spot for a late night craving. They have very limited seating inside and outside so make sure and have a buddy reserve a seat for you while you wait in line. 

    The pizza slices here are ginormous! I'm glad I only ordered one slice because I had no idea they were that large. The pizza was good but it was a little too thin and a little too greasy for me. It did satisfy my pizza craving though.

     Next time I'm in Vegas and have the late night munchies, I know exactly where I'm headed."}
{"text":"Third time eating here, this is my new Vegas tradition, love the food and love the restaurant. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Pizza was dry and toppings were minimal. Garlic knot that comes with the combo tasted like cardboard. Disappointing after seeing 4 stars for this establishment."}
{"text":"So far the best spot in Vegas for a HUGE slice of pizza! I had a pepperoni slice and some huge garlic knots on the side. Usually I can eat 2 slices of a New York style pizza and 4 slices of a franchise pizza like Domino's but with Pin-Up Pizza and its size 1 slice is good enough. I definitely recommend this spot if you're in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is super cool it's right outside the planet Hollywood casino. The girls inside are very nice and friendly. The pizza slices are huge and the prices are not that bad. Deff a good first time experience I will be back."}
{"text":"Whaaaa? This pizza is damn good. Huge slices of all different varieties. Pick one, they heat it up and you push it into your face and burn your mouth. Ok, wait, blow on it, try again!  Ahhhh, that's better and wow are the flavors good. The slices are NY style, thin and crispy. It's open late and  has a great outdoor seating area. I want a piece right now!"}
{"text":"After climbing the rather steep street-walk-over-bridge stairs from The Cosmopolitan, I was needing some food. My reservation at Nobu was three hours away and I didn't think I was going to make it without grabbing a bite somewhere. Letting my hunger drive my instincts in this new geography, I ended up at Pin Up Pizza, which is just a few feet from the street-walk-over-bridge stairs. 

Here's the thing that is great about this stop: every vacation should have high and low elements-- and, if you are prepared for it, this is the low end. Dinner at Nobu and $6 pizza, within hours of each other, seem to balance my Las Vegas preferences perfectly. So, I thought this was a good sign. Then, I took a good look around... Pin Up Pizza had cashiers in child-sized, dirty red sweaters and there were A LOT of drunk dudes. The pizza-making man couldn't seem to get ahead of orders and blank pizza pans are the ultimate sadness trigger for inhibreated bros.

The Yelp reviews looked consistent enough and I was hungry, so I ordered anyway. I was pleasantly surprised by the price. At $6, my margherita pizza slice was twice the size of my head and tasted pretty good. I ordered the margherita because there were only two pizza topping options when I got up there. 

With fake show girls taking pictures with anyone and everyone inches from where I was trying to stuff down a disproportionately-sized slice, I knew I needed to head out quickly. This is not a place that I would intentionally stop, but is a place that I would categorize as In-Case-of-Emergency-Break-Glass-and-Order-the-Pizza."}
{"text":"I was traveling with my brother and we wanted to try Pizza. When I got inside the pizza place, I notice how huge the pizza looks. We got the Chicken and Spinach topping one. My first bite of that pizza was that it was full of cheesy flavor. The crunch, the chicken, and the spinach was just right and it just really melts together into your mouth. It was like some pizza ecstasy or something. Take another bite and your like I can't stop eating this. Now folks, this is how good pizza suppose to be like. Every bite make you want more and more until you have nothing left. Then reality hits you. The pizza you have in your hand went right into your stomach, but that experience will linger onto your mind."}
{"text":"Never tried \"Secret Pizza\" @ the cosmo, BUT this is way better and so there is no need to look further on your search for lunch, dinner or late night cravings! The fact that the females working there dress up in \"pin-up\" attire makes this place even better! Gives off a trendy, cool vibe!"}
{"text":"The hubby and I was roaming around vegas blvd and decided to go back to our hotel.  We were staying at Planet Hollywood. We were suppose to go to secret pizza but the group decided to end things early. After thinking of pizza for almost the whole day, I saw pin up pizza and dedcided to check it out. 

The line was super short on a friday night. I believe I only had to wait three person to order. I ended up getting the Sausage pizza. Yummy. The thin crust pizza is the best and they reheat up the pizza, so you're getting a nice hot out of the oven pizza. The pizza was indeed a huge slice. My hubby didn't get one cause he knew I wouldn't finish it. In my mind, I was thinking i'll show him, but really I ate like five bites and still it was so much pizza left. He was very happy to finish the rest for me. 

For the price and sizes of the pizza it was an excellent deal. I would come back and try their chicken and spinach pizza. I was so eyeing that pizza."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite pizza in the USA!! I love the whole pin up theme so visiting here was a must and so glad I did. I absolutely love the pizza and the garlic knot was not tiny at all and was soooo fluffy and light on the inside. Staff was gorgeous and friendly. Biggest pizza I've ever seen offered for sale and yes you can purchase their pizzas as a whole though they typically have a variety of offerings made that you order by the slice and I think it's adorable they call that welcome mat a slice.... it was hanging off the plate in piping hot deliciousness on every angle and topped with a garlic knot bigger than my fist. Be staring or plan to share!! 
This area of dining is a hard one especially in LV because there so so many great places to choose from and great pizza joints across the US but I can say with ease this is the best! 
I cannot wait for my next visit back to LV and I tell everyone who goes to stop by and grab a slice they will not be sorry"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The pizza was phenomenal, thin toasty, extra large slices and the ingredients were top notch. While we were there, Chef Dominic treated us like family. This was an all around great environment. Oh and the garlic rolls were outstanding!"}
{"text":"Pizza looks amazing..... but what I really got was bad customer service, cold pizza, cold bread knot, and ice water that cost me $1.50

IMO secret pizza is better"}
{"text":"In a hurry? This place is perfect for getting pizza to-go! I had the spinach chicken pizza ($6.50) and garlic knot ($1). My favorite part was the garlic knot!! So soft and fluffy. The pizza is HUGE! I couldn't finish it though; it was good but a little too oily and salty for my taste. I will definitely be back for the garlic knots though, they also sell them 4 for $3!"}
{"text":"I love the margarita pizza & always ask for extra heirloom tomatoes. I live in Vegas & only allow myself to eat here if I walk here bc the slices are so big!! The garlic knots are to die!! They give plenty of toppings too! Garlic salt, sriachia, green Tabasco, parm cheese etc!!! Only compliant is it gets super crowded. Not enough room to stand"}
{"text":"Pretty cheap for a gigantic slice of pizza. One was good enough to grease up my tummy before a night of drinking. I got the  panchetta and potato pizza with some garlic knots. Even when the pizza got a little cold on our way back to the hotel, the crust was still crunchy and delicious. Totally recommend this place to anyone who is looking for something cheap to eat and if you're hungry late night. They're  open til 4 am !"}
{"text":"this place is FANTASTIC! I used to visit Secret Pizza often, but this place has stolen all of my business! The slices are as big as my head! The line can be pretty long, but it moves quite quickly and they have a ton of fans going so no one gets overheated. The food is cheap and delicious. The only potential down side for a picky eater is that you have to choose your slice from what they already have made. Once you make your selection, they do heat it up though!"}
{"text":"Pizza is very large and filling. But to me, very salty. But It was good. Just a little in the salty side where I had to drink water with it. Line was long on a late night but it was fast moving.  Fast was very friendly so I can not complain at all. I walked from Bally's and bought two slices but they didn't have any pizza boxes or bags for me to carry them securely in. Just a plate covering the pizza up. 
Overall. A late night delight for Las Vegas gluttony."}
{"text":"The slice was big, so I'll give you that... but the flavor was meh.  It was a little salty, or something... I'm not sure how to describe it.  However unlike the other low reviews here I had no problem with the staff as I found them to be pleasant.  It's a neat novelty to give this place a try, but there is better pizza to be found around town."}
{"text":"The pizza was good but it wasn't out of control good. Now let me preface this by saying I'm from the East Coast, Specifically New Jersey and New York the pizza capitals of the world. So if I'm going to compare this pizza to pizza back home there's not much of a comparison. The slices are big and the chef had a blast making it in front of me and if I'm on the strip I would definitely stop by again If I was in the area. If I'm specifically going for pizza I may go to a different place or two. The garlic knots that they sell are way too light and not dance like the ones back on the East Coast."}
{"text":"Sad. I wanted this place to be great. I wanted a piece of pizza that reminded me of good old New York. But it didn't do so. Let me say presentation is key, and they definitely had that down. I can only say it was a sight to see, after a short wait in a long line, I was greeted by an what was expected to be not so friendly tatted up lady. She wasn't mean, you could just tell she was over worked. I placed my order and my buddy placed his. I asked to have one slice cut in half and she said nope. If I do it for you I have to do it for everyone. Guess what? I got it. Place was super busy and they sell giant slices at a more then fair price. Own emu get a concession myself I tell my customers we are t allowed to have knives they don't trust us with them. Nope everything mentioned above was ok. The pizza plain cheese was split between me and a friend and another friend who had his own piece. 3 of us in the pizza business all different took one bite and trashed it. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't good. We all agreed the prices which were 6.00 for cheese and 7 for toppings were CHEAP. Easily could be 8 and 9 and they wouldn't have a complaint. But that's a one and done tourist who's never coming back. Anything wrong with that? Nope just not a killer slice. Dough not crispy, sauce was straight out of can with no spice. Cheese was quality, but just didn't come together the way a slice should. No need to worry this place will survive. 1400+ pieces a day well over 10k a day. If the rent is 100k a month they are still doing great. Labor from what we saw was about 5%. Plenty of profit. Just not a good product."}
{"text":"I came here twice in one day because it was so good. The first time, I got the chicken and spinach pizza and then the meatball pizza. I thought the flavors were really great, and the slices were huge ($7 with tax each). 
The chicken and spinach pizza was made with alfredo sauce, but I wish there was more sauce on it, as well as chicken. The toppings were lacking, but the flavors were good. The meatball pizza was good too, but I liked the chicken and spinach pizza more. For the price of a slice, it is pricey compared to BYO pizza (MOD, Pieology, Blaze), but it was a great eat in LV. 
The slices were inconsistent though, since the first slice I got was much bigger than the second slice. Overall, since I am a pizza lover, I would definitely come here again and try all the different types."}
{"text":"Looking for a big pizza slice for under $7...this is the place. 

Looking for a big pizza slice for under $7 when you've been drinking...this is the place.

Looking for a big pizza slice for under $7 that has flavor...keep going. 

Yes, I'm a finicky New Yorker and lover of any style pizza (except the weird ones from California that put sprouts and root vegetables on a pizza). Might not have been drunk enough.

Bonus star because the staff is very friendly!"}
{"text":"Great food is important to me, but customer service is the most important overall. This place scores 5 stars in both categories. 

I stay at the Ellara at least once a year, and I was thrilled to see a pizza place so close to us. I was inside the Sports book in Planet Hollywood and saw a sign that said \"Pizza by the slice\", so I ventured over to check it out. The pizza was very good and the slices are huge. Ask them to cut them in half for you and they will happily oblige. I put the pizza taste up there with Secret Pizza inside the Cosmopolitan, but that is not the main reason you should come here. You must come here for the world's BEST garlic knots. Seriously, you will be so happy that you have finally found the perfect buttery, oh so garlicky piece of heavenly goodness. They heat them up right before your eyes and there is no microwave in sight. They use real ovens and absolutely know how to make great food. 

Everyone who works here is super nice and the chefs were very proud of their food. They stay open until 2:00 am every night and 4:00 am on weekends. You can access the restaurant from outside the PH, or through the Sports Book and it is going to enrich your life when you try it out."}
{"text":"Myself and my friends were supposed to end our Vegas trip at Eggslut but after seeing the line we nope-d out of there pretty quick. Hungry, cranky, and craving greasy food we spotted pin up pizza across the street and decided to just eat there. The slices are huge, it's a little pricey but at least the portions are big and they have meal combo deals. The pizza was ok, not amazing. I could see myself coming here after the club for some drunk munchies next time. I ended up ordering a slice of cheese and a garlic knot. Ranch is $.81 cents, really almost a dollar for ranch?! I need one of those to-go things for ranch like they have for sriracha!"}
{"text":"Pin-Up pizza is the best pizza I've ever had. The first time I came to Vegas, we stopped in, I thought it was too good to be true, came back out to Vegas two weeks ago, first stop was pin-up and it was as consistent as the first time. Had a couple of my boys with me, they agreed much better than other pizza they've had. I strongly recommend making a stop at Pin-up, if not, your not getting your full Vegas experience. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times, I'm a local, and my fiancé is quite the regular as she works nearby. My pizza today was incredible; great temperature, flavor and serving. 

I did the slice, garlic knot, and soda deal for around $10. Look, it's not cheap, but if you complain about a $10 dollar meal on the strip, please don't come back to Vegas and go enjoy your KFC bucket somewhere else.

I got the chicken and spinach slice, which was very unlike me. I think I was appealed because it was still full and I assumed it was most fresh. Pizza was amazing. Garlic knot was mediocre, but it's free for a slice and a soda so, meh.

This place blows secret pizza out of the water on flavor and serving size and you won't lose your shirt paying for it."}
{"text":"Very good pizza but it's way overpriced and their service is awful. My friends and I were one of the last customers yet they looked like they were mad and didn't want us to be there. The service is just so bad, if only the service is as good as the pizza then I would give it a 5 but nope. Bad service equals 1 star. Maybe the workers should be more friendly and happier instead of giving people ugly looks."}
{"text":"It's pretty expensive but the slices are huge. This is one of those places you need to try just so you can say you did. The pizza is good but not the best in the world. So this is more about the whole experience rather than an awesome slice of pizza. So give it a shot if you need to post something new on social media or brag to your friends."}
{"text":"Amazing selections, great combos. Awesome smiling faces. Totally coming back! I had the margherita pizza omg so scrumptious!!!"}
{"text":"Good NYS pizza spot. No seating. Big slices. Simple and good. In my top 10 for sure."}
{"text":"When hubs said he wanted to come here, I was thinking this was a Twin Peaks sort of place.  I was as happy as he was disappointed to find the employee fully clothed.  We got the garlic knot (the size of my fist!) and a slice of margherita.  I thought it was a little expensive, but you do get a humongous slice.  I really thought that this was going to be all gimmick with no delivery, but I was wrong.  The tomatoes were fresh and juicy, and the moz was cut thick and had wonderful texture.  The bread was thin like Italian style but had more crunch to it; very delicious.  If I want to be picky, I'd say that the oil making riveluts down my slice was over much, but you don't come here looking for healthy options.  The garlic knot was soft and flavorful, but the headliner was clearly the pizza.

IMHO, this place bests Secret Pizza and I will return to try the other slices."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Located right in the strip outside of Planet Hollywood. So many slices to chose from, but all great. I had a pepperoni, sausage and meatball slice."}
{"text":"What a cheap eat! Go to Pin up pizza! We arrived late in Vegas on Tuesday and we came here around 3 am. We loved the pizza. Not to greasy and a great size. The pizza was very fresh and was cooked perfectly. A great late night eat."}
{"text":"Pin Up Pizza was great - except the check out girl Angela who had a huge attitude problem with her red bow. 

We aren't all drunk. She was judgmental and it pissed me off."}
{"text":"I've walked by this place so many times and finally decided to give it a go.  Went with a slice, garlic knot and soda.  Luckily it wasn't all that busy so we could fit in at the counter table they have but I could see it could get crowded on a busy day.  The price for the meal is actually pretty good so if you're looking for a quick and cheap place to eat this place should be on your list."}
{"text":"Tried the chicken and spinach pizza. It was a good tasting pizza, just the size makes it special. I got their combo which came with a garlic knot, which I wasn't a fan of, there are better garlic knots."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Service was great. The portion was massive and the ingredients was really fresh. For $7 for the size and taste of the pizza. It was totally worth it."}
{"text":"This pizza spot right here is the truth. I love pizza and Pin Up did not disappoint. Small place with some inside standing and outside standing as well. The slices were fresh and hot, BIG and foldable which is key.  Great spot to grab a slice and a drink for a quick lunch or that in between to soak up the liquor."}
{"text":"My fav pizza joint when I'm in vegas!!!! My brother showed me this place!!! 

Now it has become tradition of ours to stop by Every time we visit. 

All the pizza's are delish and HUGE!!! 

Check in thru yelp and get a free Miller!! :) 

I Haven't tried the garlic knot i am waiting for my next visit to try it!!!"}
{"text":"Wish I would've had pinks. Pizza really isn't that good, treated like our salt and doesn't come cheap"}
{"text":"It ain't NYC. I wish they didn't claim it to be NY style pizza. It got my hopes up. It was passable at 3am but for flavor and quality, head over to Earl of Sandwich, about 25 yards away. The slices are huge and thin, looking like NY style pizza. They heated up a slice of pepperoni, a slice of margherita, and a garlic knot for me. But it was dry and tough. I'll give it another chance but it wasn't impressive at all."}
{"text":"Definitely a good ny pizza experience in Vegas. The line was long but moved pretty fast. It was nice to see all the pics of entertainers and their various pin up pics throughout the space. There were only a handful of choices (I believe 6). I had a slice of pepperoni which was $7...not sure if it was worth that much but it was good. I gave it a 4 because service is really important, and if tho the 2 workers who handled the food were expedient and friendly, the young lady at the register was kind of short (of course it could've been a bad day). They had combos but for some reason when someone in front of me ordered one, the employee at the register said it wasn't available during the week. If that's the case, there should be a sign. Also when I asked about red pepper and parmesan, she said, whatever is outside is all we had... I understand there were a lot of people, however it just wasn't the most polite way to assist a patron."}
{"text":"I'm a New Yorker. This pizza rocks. Thin crust. Only difference here is their slices are about twice as large as any NY slice I've ever had and a great value for it, too. Must stop if you are in Vegas, on the strip."}
{"text":"OMG bomb ass pizza, watch the guy hand toss a gigantic pizza dough.. 

love it!!!"}
{"text":"I bookmarked this place before my trip after Michael U posted his review/pictures. The ENTIRE trip, I kept trying to end up here, and it finally happened literally right before I was headed to the airport for my flight home. And, I'm SO glad I made it happen.

The pizza is AMAZING. Thin crust, HUGE slices - not AS crispy as I enjoy my NY style to be, but definitely close enough. Employees are really funny, friendly, and talkative. While you wait, you can watch the guy tossing the crazy huge pizza dough. I just tried the plain cheese and it was great. There's standing area by the window and they have more standing area outside which is nice since mostly every day/night is beautiful in vegas. You can make it a meal by getting a garlic knot and drink- I didn't end up doing that because I wasn't that hungry when I went.

Now that I know exactly where it is (outside Planet Hollywood), I can't wait to end up here again after a night out in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The taste of the pizza was interesting. It's different from regular pizza. 
The price was ok. 
This place doesn't have tables or chairs. So you can't chill here. I had to carry my pizza around and find a seat somewhere else."}
