{"text":"Very tasty. Lovely flavours. Tasting menu portions. Unique place for the Yonge and Eglinton area. Sauces all were delicious."}
{"text":"Their pork belly is amazing - melts in your mouth and explodes with flavour. Just writing this is making me salivate."}
{"text":"I would recommend.   Little Sister is located just south of Yonge and Eglinton, and is easily walkable from the Eglinton Subway station. The decor is trendy and you can see the kitchen in the back.   The curries that I had (UDANG KARI - shrimp curry, SEMUR JAVA - braised beef) went very well with the fried rice (NASI GORENG). The cauliflower salad had great flavor and texture contrast. I didn't care too much for the croquettes or the skewers. The cocktails were also quite enjoyable. We ordered 6 dishes and 2 cocktails which came out to ~$50pp after tax and tip.   On service... We were seated near the kitchen where the wait staff seemed to like to congregate and chit chat. One of the topics that night was \"what counts as sexual harassment\"... which is not necessarily a conversation I want to hear in the background while I'm trying to catch up with a friend. The kitchen staff picked up on this and tried to get them to stop (only after offering their 2c about the subject).   My experience was quite memorable overall - the food was great and I learned a thing or two about sexual harassment legalities."}
{"text":"Great tasting food (nice and spicy) and relatively authentic ---for a Dutch-inspired menu.   Embarrassingly tiny portions (EVEN for tapas) and the waitress knew NOTHING about the food let alone how to properly pronounce the dishes.   Another example of cultural appropriation - with a grating Canadian twang."}
{"text":"Went here in the summer and had a pretty good meal. The quality of the food is great, and the drinks are cool.  but, the food is way overpriced for the portions being so small. left hungry."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and great ambiance!!  I went hear a few nights ago and loved the vibes and the flavourful menu. I had the chicken skewers and coconut shrimp curry and need to go back to try the rest of the menu. The dishes are perfect for sharing (exactly what my gf and I did) and the drinks are simple, but delicious for a reasonable price.   Can't wait go back and try some other Indonesian dishes!!"}
{"text":"Wow, finally something good north of Bloor.  Very fresh and reminded me of Electric Mudd BBQ / grand electric, don't ask me why, just does.  We had a bit everything and nothing disappointed, and beat my expectations.  The desserts were pretty bad ass too.  Definitely coming back soon.  Don't care that it wasn't too Indonesian, it was pretty damn good."}
{"text":"Good - Cute little place, good service, friendly atmosphere Bad - Very pricey for the amount of food you get.  I know it's a tapas place but $6.50 for 4 pieces of vegetables?  That's too much for too little.  Food was not memorable either, pork belly was good, everything else was very mediocre.  Spent over $120, and left still hungry, also had indigestion afterwards, not sure if it was the pork belly or the skewers."}
{"text":"Saw the Globe and Mail review and thought to try this place out. Couldn't be happier with this place! Great food, amazing cocktail menu, and the decor is to die for.   Really great friendly service, and I love looking into the kitchen. From wherever you are in the restaurant. Favourite bites were the coconut shrimp curry, chicken satays, and their watermelon salad looks great.   I'll be back for sure. Make a reservation!!"}
{"text":"For such a multicultural city like Toronto, there is much to be desired when it comes to Indonesian food. Enter Little Sister Indonesian Food Bar. The first impression I had at Little Sister Indonesian Food Bar was the menu. A double sided menu printed on a tenured piece of cardboard. While some may find old cardboard menus to be offputting, I thought it was executed rather tastefully and apt for this low-key urban environment.  Having positioned myself at the bar, I had the opportunity to watch the bartender prepare this drink. And believe me, it's quite a performance! One after one I watch fresh fruits and vegetables being mulled, peeled, and shaken, into this Kintamani Punch. And the result? Summer in a cup.  I'm no expert when it comes to Indonesian cuisine, but I can say that everything here is delicious! My favourite was the Shrimp Lettuce Wrap which was a spicy combination of succulent shrimp and crunchy shallots in a refreshing lettuce wrap. The two meat dishes, Sambal Daging and Semur Java were both hefty on flavourful marinates and spices. The Krupuk Prawn Crackers with peanut sauce is a MUST ORDER. A word of caution for the delicate tongue though, some of the dishes can pack some heat!"}
{"text":"Just came back from a dinner at the Little Sister. Food was very good, prices ,to high for served portions. But the service was terrible, slow, some of the waitress were  completely confused, Shame"}
{"text":"I love this place! I received the best service ever! The atmosphere is really cool, the servers are amazing. Everyone takes the time to explain what each food item is, even when its super busy! The food is delicious, but you have to order a lot of stuff!"}
{"text":"Don't come if you're hungry.  Little SIster officially turned me off of tapas forever.  I came with a group of 6 people, and when we asked the waitress what to order - she said a group of our size should order EVERYTHING.  We ended up order 7 dishes and didn't even come close to being satisfied.  To top it off, the waitress did not know what dishes were shellfish-free, for our friend who had an allergy.  We tried the Pork skewers, which were juices, but $6 for 3 tiny cubes of meat is not worth it. Nasi Goreng had interesting flavors, but only amounted to a few spoonfuls of rice.    Service was okay, decor was nice, pleasant ambiance."}
{"text":"Having read glowing reviews of this restaurant on The Globe and Mail and The Toronto Star, I was looking forward to some delicious authentic Indonesian cuisine. While the dishes are Indonesian 'inspired' I am sad to say I was disappointed on the authenticity front. The fare was certainly adjusted to accommodate western taste and the clientele of the neighborhood. Food portions are very small. See the photo attached to this post. Each of them is a main course.  Service was quick and good. Nice interior. Hard to get reservation.... But they seem to accommodate walk ins as well. Weird smell of chlorine that whiffs to your nose at times... Not sure what the source of the smell is."}
{"text":"Awesome place with a cool vibe, the food is delicious and great cocktails. Must make a reservation, the place is very small! The tacos and lettuce wraps are great."}
{"text":"I've been to Little Sister about 10 times now and have never had anything less than an amazing experience.   Staff/Service  The staff are really knowledgeable - we always ask them questions about certain dishes, and they can tell you how many plates to get for the size of your party so no one leaves hungry. When the restaurant is busy it can take awhile to be seated, but we'll usually put our names down on the list and get a drink at their sister bar, Bar Batavia, until we're called. Never had an issue with the service - even with big groups the staff get drink and food orders correct, and are always nearby to refill water etc.  Atmosphere  The restaurant itself is beautiful - high ceilings, unique décor and open kitchen. The music is top 40/old school hip hop depending on the night, and loud and bustling, but just enough so that you can hear the people at your table and no one else.   Food  What can I say? My boyfriend and I have tried every item on the menu, and I'd order all of them again. This is a small-plate/sharing restaurant! Do not expect gigantic portions of food. We'll typically order 5-6 dishes between the two of us and leave full. Some stand-outs: Nasi Goreng (beautiful fried rice, goes well with every meat dish); Semur Java (braised beef with crispy potato and green onion); Udang Kari (shrimp coconut curry); Ayam Panggang (sweet chilli chicken with bean sprouts); Watermelon salad; Rendang Taco... The list goes on.   Pairing a few \"Traditional\" meat dishes with one or two of the \"Snacks\" (beef croquettes and wantons are amazing) plus two \"Sides\" (Nasi Goreng, Watermelon Salad Fried Cauliflower Salad) means you'll have a balanced and filling meal. The staff always do a double-take at how many dishes we order for just 2 people, but we inevitably finish everything and (almost literally) lick the plates clean!  Drinks  Is it too bold to say these are the best cocktails in the city? Prices are reasonable. There's so much variety - spicy, sour, sweet - whatever you want, their signature cocktail list delivers on. I always have 2-3 when I come, my personal favorite being the Little Brother.  You won't leave Little Sister with a $30 bill, but you will leave with a full stomach and incredibly satisfied!"}
{"text":"Too spicy, too pricey and too much attitude. $7 for a skewer is absurd...My stomach was upset for a week after our dinner here."}
{"text":"Food is great! The atmosphere is great, went there during the summer . Music came in all forms of genres. It's a small place, about 20 people seat capacity. Will recommend"}
{"text":"A gem of a place! fun, great service and of course, the food.  Pretty unique Indonesian flavours, even with so many restaurants in Toronto.  Considering its mid-town location, the decor is unexpected but in a good way.  Always busy and probably impossible if you're more than 4 people, without reservations.  Just go!"}
{"text":"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! Spent $50 for three insultingly, small dishes. Pics from UberEats do not represent the food at all. Food arrived cold too (which could be blamed on the driver too)  Everything tasted OK at best but was all snack portions. MOST DEFINITELY NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY WHATSOEVER!  Never buying food from this BS place again. I highly recommend you do the same."}
{"text":"Came here for a date night on a Saturday.  We made no reservations, but they said there was only a 30 minute wait at 8:30pm, so we went upstairs to get some drinks.  We loved the vibe upstairs, especially the comfy couches!  The music and bartender/server was awesome.  We decided to order an appie of a spiced fried chicken the server/bartender recommended and a round of drinks.  Before we finished our drink and our appie arrived, we were told they had two seats at the bar, so down we went.  When we sat down, our chicken arrived, and our bartender said we were lucky as they don't have that item in the main restaurant.  It was pretty darn good, so I'm glad we got that!  We ordered the nasi goreng, braised beef, and the fried cauliflower salad.  All were great, but I really enjoyed the nasi goreng and the cauliflower salad while my husband loved the braised beef.  We ordered a coconut pudding for dessert which was nice and light, but there was almost too much toasted coconut on top for my taste.  Overall, great drinks, great service, great music, and good food means we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Let me start with some small print: I'm Dutch. Therefore I came into this place with a certain expectation of what the food would/should be like. (For those who don't know, Indonesian cuisine is very common and very good in Holland and the owner of this place is Dutch).  I'm also tall. Sitting at the bar is impossible and sitting at the front tables is uncomfortable. Otherwise the design and decor are very nice. The cardboard menu is cool.  We had the chicken satay skewers to start. I was hoping for some more peanut sauce on them, but the chicken was nice. I would have had more if they weren't so expensive.  Then had the babi pangang. Disappointed with it. Bland and mushy. Far from the great tasting babi pangang in Holland. Would never have that again.  Service was friendly. Prices too high. Might not be back."}
{"text":"Great tasting and flavourful enough Indonesian food , spicy enough for the North American palate. The Satay Lillit is served with a sour and spicy kind of fermented veggie sambal , quite good but the chicken is minced . The Nasi Gorang is a good compliment to any stewed dishes, served with a mixture of finely diced vegetables and lovely moist long grain rice. The Udang Kari is a shrimp coconut yellow curry served with scallions and the curry itself has a nice solid substance to it. Overall a nice place to take your lover or hang out and share various dishes with friends. The prices are not reasonably priced against the portions , too over priced for the simple and beautiful Indonesian cuisine, the portion are too small , which has become quite a trend with all the fancier Asian restaurants in town . The music played is way too loud more for the enjoyment of the owners not customers, definitely An Indonesian fusion based twist will add to the sweet ambiance."}
{"text":"Oh my goddess! I had been wanting to go to Little Sister since it opened last year. My only concern was that soy sauce featured in most dishes, and soy sauce isn't usually gluten free. (And I have celiac.) However!!! Upon arriving last night, I was informed that they'd taken to using gf soy sauce, and thus that almost everything on the menu was gluten free. Huzzah!  My friend and I ordered their version of a g and t, a Ubud hangout, which was amazing! Spicy, fresh, cilantro-y. Oh lawd.  We then enjoyed the beef satay, and then the sea bream special (her), and the kecap babi (me). So flavourful and tender! So spicy and nice. I am going back as soon as I have the excuse/another out of town guest!"}
{"text":"I had no prior experience with Indonesian cuisine so I had no idea what to expect. I was surprised at how similar yet also how different Indonesian food is from other cuisines in South east Asia. Staff were helpful and courteous and gave great advice for what to order. Portions were smaller than I would have liked and what the prices might have suggested. The cocktails are almost as much as a main dish! This is definitely a sharing-plate type of place, so if you're coming here for a meal rather than snacking you're going to end up with an expensive bill! I hate leaving a restaurant still hungry but I felt it made more sense to order more food elsewhere. Pro tip: don't sit at the tables against the window on a hot summer day, you'll burn up in the heat,"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  We had an enjoyable meal at Little Sister.  We came without a reservation, but it was ~430pm, so we were promptly offered seats.  I was with a friend whom I had not seen in over a year+, and they planned to seat us at one of the tables that had 2 seats side-by-side.  We requested a different seating arrangement and they offered to seat us at the end of a communal table so we could be face to face.  That worked fine for us!  We ordered the peanut chicken skewers, 2xbeef rendang tacos (one per person), cauliflower salad, pork belly, and the nasi goreng.  This plus a couple of cocktails and wine.  Everything was delicious!  And we were sufficiently full, without being stuffed.  Service was friendly and efficient.  As it was our first time here, the server took the time to explain the menu, and made some recommendations.  Will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Had a great evening here. Food selection was great and everything tasted amazing. Cocktails were nice and complimented the food well. Service was fantastic. The manager Maggie was courteous, professional and very helpful. Her food suggestions were on point and her welcoming attitude made for a great experience. Well done! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place is a MUST for any taste.   The cocktails are untouchable.   We had a bottle of wine from 2005 from Spain and it was phenomenal at $42.   We tried 4 dishes plus deserts and literally everything was exceptional.   I've lived in the area for 18 years and I think this is a unique experience for the area all together."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in my neighbourhood by far. The food is so unique and full of flavour. LOVE THIS PLACE. I love how boutique it is - it sort of has a surfer vibe to it. The prices are really decent and the drinks are incredible - I could watch the bartender mix all day!  The beef dish and the rice are so tasty! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We couldn't get a reservation, but were assured that they always save room for walk-ins, so we went anyway, knowing we would have to wait.  When we arrived, we were told that they would have a table in 30 minutes, 45 minutes max.  We were happy to wait, and went accross the street for a drink.  After waiting for an hour, we went back and were told that it would be another 30  minutes+.  The hostess obviously didn't know what she was doing, so we left.  Not likely to try again."}
{"text":"Any drink with the word \"punch\" in it is always a delightful adventure. :) ...last time we ordered extra wontons to go because we apparently have no problem dying happy."}
{"text":"Unique Indonesia restaurant and even more rare given the location near Davisville. There were some good spots, but overall it didn't impress. Love the space and decor, but the food fell a short.   Satays were dry and sauces lacked punch or spice. The shrimp lettuce wraps were boring and lacked flavour. The cauliflower salad was likely the best item and I'd recommend. The shrimp curry was inferior to most decent Thai restaurants in the city. Lastly, the shrimp and beef tacos were decent but a bit out of place on a menu like this. Also, the price point is a bit high for the small portions."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to Little Sister, but found it to be overrated and represent the worst parts of tapas-style dining.   The portions were way too small, and the quality of the food wasn't so great that it made the prices worth it. The worst thing we ordered were the mustard greens, which included only two pieces and cost $6 or $7. The seating and service was also far too casual for the price point.  You'd be much better going off to Restoran Malaysia in Richmond Hill. Malaysia and Indonesia have similar cuisine (nasi goreng, satay) and the dining experience was much better there."}
{"text":"If you can get a table, it's a nice change of pace and reasonably priced.  The server was very helpful with suggestions for the tasting menu that we had."}
{"text":"The portion size is ridiculous or at least it does not match up with the price. Food was good but was served lukewarm and  for the price they charge you I would expect my food was served hot. Don't understand what the hype is about.  Unless they change the portion size or price I wont be back."}
{"text":"The food was good...but not memorable or anything that special. I'd ready reviews that the quantities were small but seeing as Toronto is sharing plate crazy I figured it was just in line with the trend. Instead they really were TINY. $15 shrimp curry was very nice (exactly like British chicken korma you can get for a few quid if you've ever been to the UK) but the size was literally that of a small soup bowl. The cauliflower salad was the best thing but I'd skip it and spend your money elsewhere.  The staff were nice...ish. Nothing special and didnt make me feel comfortable.  Not worth the subway to Davisville."}
{"text":"Little Sister is my new favourite restaurant around Young and Eg. the food was very flavourful, the ambiance was warm and cozy. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I told myself I will not review this place. A friend suggested the place and I went along. But after the meal, I went into Yelp and read other reviews and felt I've got to give my 2 cents worth. I lived in South East Asia for 50 years and I'm very familiar with Indonesian, Malaysian and Thai cuisine. Believe me, if you are after authentic Indonesian food, this is not the place. My friend and I ordered 3 dishes with rice and a dessert. First was the Satay Lilit which was 3 skewers of meat. I didn't like that it was made of mince. I like my satay to be made of chunks of meat. It was flavorful enough but I felt that the overriding flavor was a tad too heavy with lemongrass. Next dish was the Urab which was a dish of lightly cooked greens. I would describe it as fusion, nothing really identifiable as Indonesian. It was rather cold on arrival and the portion was measly. Ok I get it that this was a tapas style restaurant. If the restaurant wants to serve small portions like this to encourage patrons to have a variety of dishes (rijsttafel style), then they should consider lowering the prices. The last dish was the Ikan Belado. We were extremely disappointed when it arrived to see a small piece of sea bream that did not look anything like what an Ikan Belado should look like. This should have been a fried fish with chili paste slathered on it. It did not look anything like that and it certainly did not taste anything like it. This small portion of fish cost $16! The dessert was an unforgettable concoction of coconut pudding with palm sugar (commonly called gula Melaka back home). I will not go back again. This is a restaurant serving food that is masquerading as Indonesian food."}
{"text":"I always like to try different food and this was on my go-to list so i finally got to try. I went here in Oct with a friend on Monday night. It wasnt packed but some tables were reserved alreasy so we sat at a bar. The bartender waa very friendly and explained all the famous dishes. We ordered 4 dishes. Loved the skewers and croquet. The fried rice was decent. We also ordered a bottle of wine. They didnt have many options for wine tho. For dessert, we ordered coconut ice cream which had strong ginger flavor than coconut lol. My fav was the skewers. Now that im thinking back, everything had coconut flavor to it. Im a fan of coconut so i loved tge flavors but if u r not a big fan of coconut please ask the server for alternative."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and great service! A bit on the pricey side because the dishes are tapas-sized, so you end up needing to order many dishes to be full  We had:  -fried cauliflower: 3/5  Was okay. Nothing to write home about.  -nasi goreng: 5/5 This vegetable fried rice was delicious!!! We ate it with the shrimp curry and ended up ordering more because we loved it so much  -grilled mustard greens: 4/5  -udang kari (shrimp coconut curry): 5/5 This was my favourite. So so creamy and yummy.   -braised beef taco: 5/5  Would come back again!"}
{"text":"I don't what they serve, but it is absolutly not authentic indonesian. The nasi goreng is like any chinese takeout fried rice. The babi pangang is a disgrace. Never will come back."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday and being a big fan of southeast Asian food, I was a bit disappointed.  As an introduction to Indonesian/Malay food, this place would be great but for those familiar with the flavors of this cuisine, it lacked the customary punch of flavours. No particular dish really stood out."}
{"text":"To be honest I found Little Sister to be somewhat disappointing. I'm not particularly a fan of Tapas, mostly because a tapas bar ends up having portions which are far too small and far too much for a normal meal and this is no different at Little Sister. Small portions and expensive prices don't do justice, I feel, to authentic Indonesian food which is traditionally served in far larger portions (and with rice). Expect to spend around $25 dollars for a meal, an amount which I find too uncomfortable for my limited budget under normal circumstances.  Little Sister is styled as a small tapas bar more than a sit down restaurant and small parties are seated at a shared table. The menu itself was lacking many of my more liked Indonesian dishes I'm fond of at home like bakmi, rawon, or soto ayam but the dishes it did have I think are fairly good. The food itself tends towards Balinese cooking more than the East Java cooking I'm familiar with from home so I did find the satay lilit, a Balinese satay, (a minced meat skewer) a bit odd for my liking. I did find that the meat itself was well spiced. The satay does, however show off the small portions present at Little Sister with only 3 skewers for 6 dollars, and I don't quite think the skewers were worth $2 each.  I also tried Urab, a traditional Balinese salad made of steamed vegetables and coconuts. I thoroughly enjoyed the salad though it was a bit more western than would have been obtained in Indonesia with it's very small proportion of coconuts. However, this variation is far less the fusion on the menu that was rendang taco. The taste itself reminded my greatly of Indonesian food I've had before with it's use of bawang orgeng (fried red onion) and chili.  I was disappointed with the main dish I ordered, the pictured ayam pangang (grilled chicken). Like everything else in this restaurant, the food was plated beautifully, in this case on a bed of pickled vegetables which had pleasant pungency lent to it by chilli peppers. The darkness of the restaurant at night takes away a bit from the beauty of the food, however. I suppose it's not a fair criticism but I feel as if my mother's version of ayam pangang is more tasty (and cheaper) than the dish presented here. The chicken itself seemed to be fairly simple and a similar taste can probably be obtained by grilling chicken marinated in chilli peppers and kecap manis (sweet, thickened Indonesian soy sauce, an essential condiment in Indonesian cooking) but it did taste good.  Little Sister, as Toronto's only Indonesian food, I think is somewhat of a letdown. With a small menu, small portions, and expensive pricing, I had hoped for a more accessible introduction for friends to Indonesian cooking. To this end, the restaurant itself appeals less to Indonesians looking for a taste of home than to Toronto's foodies and tourists. The food was good and the quality of it is seen in the consistently busy and loud atmosphere of the establishment. Little Sister is, perhaps, a place you should try at least once to sample some of the cuisine of one of the most populated countries of the world, but it's certainly not a place to go to every day."}
{"text":"Decided to get dinner with a couple of my girlfriends on the recommendation of a friend and I cannot find one bad thing to say about the place, the food or the drinks. The staff was extremely warm and welcoming and accommodated us even though we didn't have a reservation. They had even opened up the small but cute patio area for the summer!   We started with some cocktails which were made to perfection. The concoction as well as the presentation was impeccable. They are on the expensive side but I assure you they are not the run of the mill cocktails you are served at downtown bars. I got the Ubud Hangout cocktail and liked it so much, I ordered seconds. It's the right blend of spicy and sweet and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a little kick to their cocktails.   The food was great too! We got several small plates and decided to share. My top three 1. Pork belly 2. Cauliflower salad 3. Nasi goreng which would go well with any of the curries on the menu. If you just wanna try one thing, try the pork belly! We ended with dessert which was again unique.   Great little place near Yonge and Eg. I for one will definitely be going back here! Nice little spot for smaller group. Might be a little tight for groups larger than 5-6 people."}
{"text":"Came here with friends. I made reservations online and everything was very easy. I got there and was seated to a table at the back. The space is pretty small at the front. The music is pretty loud at the front, at the back wasn't as loud. Very nice vibe to the place and it is very hip. My entire party didn't show up so we were waiting for a while. We got tap water to drink. While waiting, our waitress asked us if we needed to order drinks or anything. Since she came a few times to check and she said well would you like to order something to start while you're waiting? Just felt a little pressured to order something so got the shrimp chips with peanut sauce which was about $4 something. For dinner we got Sea Bream, Pork belly, fried rice and regular rice. Then later we ordered beef tacos. The flavours were good but the portions are pretty small. I think the best thing for me was the beef tacos. The coconut crema was the best."}
{"text":"Different and interesting menu.  Small plates allow you to try a variety of dishes.   The satays are addictive.  Friendly service.   Nice buzz with moderately loud noise level.     Definitely worth return visits."}
{"text":"Unlike other Asian restaurants, this place is indeed a hidden gem with a modern chic bar with amazing tapa selection. My Indonesian friend finally booked a table for us and of course, I outsourced my decision making to him completely.   I recommend all the Satay dishes, especially satay lilit. Also I like the Babi Panhhang, which is a lettuce pork wrap (the deep fried pork skin makes everything taste better). Also the rendong, a dish similar to taco, with mouthwatering coconut sauce. We ordered get the watermelon salad to balance the spicy food.   Overall, a great place for friends! If you like slightly quiet environment, go sit close to the kitchen (so you won't get too much noise close to the bar)."}
{"text":"Had a great time on Friday! Dishes are flavourful and come out quickly, and the service was great. Sat at the communal table, and the vibe in the restaurant is so upbeat - happy to have found an option for an Indonesian food fix in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great ambience. Fun evening, excellent caring service. The skewers are served in 3's. Rarely diners go in odd numbers. Little sister is well advised to consider even number servings.  The menu presented on a brown cardboard is a difficult read. My IPhone flashlight came to my rescue.  Overall a SEXY place to visit to have fun. Good food is important to me but not always the mood maker. Little Sister does well in mood making.  Cheers"}
{"text":"While the food itself was tasty, it does not justify the impossibly tiny portions and big price. In particular, the tacos were made for lilipitians. Yes tasty but  tiny tiny tiny. And while the beef was good, 5 small chunks for $16-$17? Come on now. We left, feeling like we could have easily eaten 3 more dishes but didn't want to deal with the high prices."}
{"text":"Service was ok. The food was certainly not worth the prices they charged. $16 for coconut curry abrió and we only got 6 pieces of shrimp. We heard others say similar things."}
{"text":"Dinner   Ambience/Food/Service: 4/5 Value:3.5/5  We were heading out to Tabule, our fave resto in the hood, but was closed.....luckily for us there was space at Little Sister. Jeremy the bartender is a good host. The vibe here is great, easy going, upbeat and cozy.   Food: Mains, apps and desert were delish.  Cocktail: Had the one with ginger, tyme and Jaggery (palm sugar). Was refreshing. Highly recommend that.    While Khao San is still my go to for the best South East Asian food, this place has better ambience.   Sure this place is a little pricey, but the portion size for the dishes was satisfactory. Here's hoping they'll be serving Indonesian  coffee in the near future :)   Repeat: Yes."}
{"text":"I brought my Indonesian bf here and we felt that it was quite overpriced. The dishes were very small and our cocktails weren't as hard as some other downtown restaurants with the same vibe.  With that being said, this is one of the only places that focuses on Indonesian food and flavours in a nice sit-down restaurant setting to the public. The restaurant design and ambiance is cool."}
{"text":"I live in the area so I come here when I'm craving shrimp chips! I also came here with Janna S. for a group dinner she organized. We tried every item on the menu and I would say after coming here a few more time, the dishes are very consistent - consistently good! I really like the chicken and beef taco (with extra cilantro!!) and also the lettuce wraps. I also liked the pork belly dish (Babi Panggang) and skewers - man, that peanut saaau-se.   One thing I also really like about Little Sister is the drinks. They're pretty pricey (about $12) but I would say it's worth it because a lot of their bitters are made in house and they are very yummy!  The only thing that was meh was the desserts. I would says skip it at Little Sister and get gelato instead!"}
{"text":"We were a group of 4 for dinner.  The only reservation time was past 9 pm.  A nice cozy restaurant that's kind of loud.  We read on Yelp to try everything.  We picked one skewer.  I don't remember the type of meat it was but it was delicious and flavourful of lemongrass.  The lettuce wraps were next and they were quite spicy.  We should note these items came before our drinks which one of our friends noticed.  We also got the tacos which were nice but $5 each a tad pricey.  We had the fish of the day and the stewed beef.  Both were good, portions a little small even for tapas.  We had the cauliflower which we really enjoyed and 2 bowls of fried rice to share.  Really tasty food, we liked it better than another Asian style tapas on the west side of the city.  We would come back."}
{"text":"Loved the beef tacos here! This is a great place for Indonesian tapas. I'd recommend getting a taco per person (you can try chicken or beef; beef if you have peanut allergies). Then you can share the small dishes amongst your table. The portions aren't very big so it's recommended to get 8 dishes (including tacos) per four people. We had the shrimp curry which has a bit of kick to it but it's not excessively spicy. The nasi goreng went really well with it. Their cocktails are also lovely! Overall great ambience, small and cozy vibe. Definitely recommend having reservations as it gets pretty busy on the weekends."}
{"text":"After many weeks trying to get in here we finally got a reservation for 6 people.  I wasn't aware this was a tapas place as I would have never come.  The portions are extremely small for the price.  Any Indonesian, Malaysian, or Thai place I have been has generous portions and always I leave feeling full.  I ordered 6 items between my girlfriend and I which came to 70 dollars and it felt like I didn't even eat.  The beef dish had maybe 6 small pieces of beef in a sauce for 14 dollars!  It was way too pricey for the simple ingredients in it.  Another friend order the fish special...it was a small piece of fish.  If you ever go to an asian place and they have a fish special for 15 they usually cook you a fish not a tiny portion of fish.  The pork belly looked amazing from the menu but was extremely disappointing that it was 4 small pieces.    It is not like I don't go to nice restaurants, or appreciate good food.  I have been to many places that have tapas, or izakaya and been very happy with the quality and the price/portions.  I just felt underwhelmed with my food and the entire experience.  Paying so much for small portions, that are served off of Ikea plates and cups just doesn't add up in my books.    I will not return here as there are many other more authentic Indonesian places to eat.  I think this place caters to the rich people who live in the area and don't know any better about what good Indonesian food actually tastes like.    For the pros, the atmosphere was nice itself.  The waitress was nice but she told us we should order the entire menu.  We asked if they had like a set dinner for 6 or like if that was some special where we get everything on the menu and she said no it is literally ordering one of each item on the menu...that is weird to me."}
{"text":"I learned about Little Sister through blogTO's article on \"The top 30 restaurants for a first date in Toronto by neighbourhood\", where it was the representative for the Yonge and Eglinton area. Since a restaurant in Toronto dedicated to street-style Indonesian cuisine seemed fairly unique, my boyfriend and I agreed that this would be a worthy date-night candidate. We went on a Friday night, at around 5:00pm.  Ambiance: Channeling inspiration from a street hawker market, the restaurant is dimly lit and deliberately designed to look slightly grungy. The menus are all hand made, it seems, printed on cardboard with strips of yellow tape decorating the sides. Clearly efforts have been made to immerse you into the street food experience, though not at street market prices (more on that later). My boyfriend chose not to make reservations, believing that arriving so early would guarantee us a table. Unfortunately, after consulting her iPad, the waitress said that there were only two small tables that were available, so we had no choice but to be crammed elbow-to-elbow for the rest of the meal. Those tables are intended to maximize space but I was pretty uncomfortable. Also, in the period of time that we arrived, ate, and left, the restaurant hardly filled up at all.   Service: Service was overall, alright. The guy working at the bar was exceptionally friendly and attentive! He noticed defects in my glass, twice, and quickly exchanged it for a new one. It is gestures like that that I remember about a restaurant. Our waitress provided some suggestions for what to order, although I felt like she was recommending just about everything on the menu.   Food: Enjoyed a sampling of  Satay Sapi (beef, soy sauce, lime leaf & lemongrass), Ayam Panggang (sweet chili grilled chicken sitting on a bed of bean sprouts, green onion, and cilantro), and Nasi Goreng (fried rice). I say sampling because the portions were so small, and ultimately makes the meal very pricey! Four very small satay skewers came up to $10, for example.  It felt like we were having a snack, but paying way too much. Everything tasted fine, while the beef satay was not very tender and the quick fix was adding the sauces available at our table. My personal favourite was the fried rice - salty and spicy.  Overall, for all its hype, I have to say I was a bit disappointed. This is not a repeat for me."}
{"text":"I went to Little Sister last night with a friend. I had made a reservation, and when I called to let them know we'd be a little late, they said it was no problem and thanked me for calling - so I thought that was nice. So when we got there our table was ready, and we spent some time looking over the cocktail list and asked the server what she recommended - we both ended up getting the Ubud Hangout as per the server's recommendation. It was really good, refreshing but still with a kick and super well mixed. I'm not a huge cocktail person, and these ones aren't cheap, but they are definitely good.  And now the food! We ordered the krupuk, fried cauliflower salad, nasi goreng, semur java and rendang taco. I only ate the krupuk, salad and rice - but it was all good, especially the salad. My friend said she really enjoyed the rendang and braised beef as well. The only downside is they took awhile to take our order while waiting for our drinks and we were both hungry - but the food came out quickly so not a huge deal. I'd come here again, definitely to get the cauliflower salad."}
{"text":"Courtesy of an event created on Yelp by a fellow Yelp Elite, 7 of us tackled Little Sister and we ordered......EVERYTHING ON THE (cardboard) MENU. Granted, it's not a huge menu, but it was pretty cool to order everything. Felt a lil special, just sayin.    We started with the Snack menu while we were waiting for all of our guests; Krupuk(prawn crackers w/ peanut sauce) and Pangsit(beef wontons) were first to arrive. As someone whom is not used to spicy food, some of the sauces surprised me(I was not alone). The menu didn't specify if something was hot, so it was a shock each time. The peanut sauce with the prawn crackers had a little heat, but it was sweet; a nice combo. The beef wontons were fantastic. I dipped my wonton and was about to take a big bite when the sauce dripped onto my hand. I wiped it off and tasted it; I almost went into a coughing fit. Someone else was about to take a big bite with sauce when she saw the look on my face. She was not used to spice either! Saved! I didn't think they needed sauce anyway!    The tacos were fantastic; all of them! Each of them had fresh veggies and delightful sauces. I could've eaten more of those and everyone agreed. The Sumatra Spiced Beef Croquettes were another winner. As a Dutch gal, I'm used to croquettes being a bit bland and needing mustard to liven them up; these didn't need it. The beef was seasoned with the perfect amount of spice inside that crispy coating. MmmMmm.    The skewers well all to die for. The meat was moist and tender and each skewer had it's own distinct flavour. The savoury spices paired with the sweet sauces made them disappear fast!     Now for the mains...    Ayam Panggang(sweet chili grilled chicken) was fantastic. The portion was good and the flavours were fantastic. The guests that didn't like cilantro were not a fan, but that left more for the rest of us! Babi Panggang(pork belly) was one of my favourites. Tender, flavourful; very well rounded with the pickled bean sprouts and fresh chili sauce. Udang kari(coconut curry shrimp) didn't last long and neither did the Ikan Bumbu Bali(spice crusted fish).    The sides, how could we forget about them?! After all that spice, we were practically fighting over the Watermelon Salad. It was cold and refreshing; a nice palette cleanser. The Fried Cauliflower Salad was addicting; I wanted it all for myself! The Fried Rice and Mustard Green Vegetables were also there to balance things out. We were on flavour overload!    Dessert was a coconut pudding and mocha chocolate icecream. The coconut pudding was OK but the ice cream was a fantastic end to the evening. The drinks were a little on the expensive side, but they give you large bottles of water.    I've never had food like this before, so I have nothing to compare it to. Looks like an excuse to go to another Indonesian restaurant. :D"}
{"text":"So many pros! The service was lovely, probably my favourite thing about this restaurant were the servers. The dishes are so flavourful and the instant you take a bite, overwhelming flavour just explodes in your mouth.   We ordered the califlower salad, semur java, nasi goreng and a chicken taco. The portions are small (it's similar to tapas style), and a bit pricey, but oh so delicious. Also ordered the coconut pudding (highly recommend!)  It's a smallish restaurant so make reservations beforehand. It was quite busy on Saturday night when we went."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! We ordered a combination of sides (Nasi Goreng, fried cauliflower, and mustard greens) then coupled them with the traditional braised pork shoulder and it was a marriage made in  Dutch/Indonesian heaven. The flavours and textures of each dish was like a party in my mouth. This is not good for the faint of heart as your palate bursts with exotic flavours. Excellent, friendly and customer centric service."}
{"text":"Overall, the food was good. We ordered satay lilet (balinese chicken skewers), satay sapi (beef skewers), babi guling (pork wrap), rendang taco, balinese shredded chicken taco, semur java, nasi goreng (fried rice), and babi panggang (roasted pork belly). Their portion is indeed small, as they advertise it as tapas menu; but all the foods were very flavourful with good presentation, except satay sapi that tasted flat (the meat didn't have as much flavour as its sauce). Semur java is definitely the standout of the night, with babi guling as close second. the sauce from semur java is good to be eaten with rice / nasi goreng.  Overall the service was nice and prompt, but our server got some of our orders mixed up. She didn't have any notebook or tablet with her. Being a tapas bar that expect each customer to order 3-4 dishes (thus, recommended our group of 4 to order 12-15 dishes), it seems to be a bad oversight not to have their servers write down people's orders (that is expected to be plenty)."}
{"text":"My sons and me had late lunch this afternoon. We are tourists. The waitress was not nice to us but she was nice to other guests. I don't know why ?. Maybe because we are Asians ?. The sate ayam was too sour, the nasi goreng was too simple. It was just like steamed rice then fried, no taste. It was not Indonesian nasi goreng. Semur ayam was ok. Ikan bakar also too sour. Over all not recommended. This is not Indonesian restaurant with Indonesian hospitality."}
{"text":"This is a really tasty restaurant. Want to get that out there right away. The food is well prepared and has amazing flavours and textures. The sauce game here is another level. The green sambal on the table is incredible. It tastes good on everything. It's spicy yet refreshing.    We ordered krupuk, chicken satay, Nasi goreng, beef croquettes, ayam panggang, and semur Java.   It was all incredibly good. The peanut sauce with the satay skewers was so yum. The Nasi goreng is flavourful and complements all the dishes. If you're wanting rice, definitely do the Nasi.   While the food is super tight, it's a bit more on the expensive side. So it can add up if you're like me and have insatiable hunger lol.   The service was ok. Not super warm and inviting. At times I felt they were annoyed with our presence which isn't the best vibe.   In sum, It's worth eating here but I probably won't be back too often given the location and cool service."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good and had great service. Came only for food and a few beers. Cocktail selection looked awesome, but didn't try any.    Came here with my girlfriend who's Indonesian,  and while some of the flavours were somewhat authentic, most flavours were definitely subdued. Not exactly the most indo food, and definitely high on the hipster scale.   We had the following for dinner:  Nasi gorang- this was the indo fried rice. Was sweeter than expected and tasted much better with the condiments they had (sambal chili sauce and some garlic hot pepper concoction)  good texture   Satay lilet- minced chicken with a lot of lemon grass flavouring. Really good, although slightly dry.   Babi panggang- delicious and definite must have. 5 or 6 thick slices of pork belly atop pickled veggies. Best dish of the night. Delicious when eaten with rice  Spiced beef croquettes- came with 2 croquettes. These were okay. Filled with braised beef, nothing of out the ordinary flavour-wise, but good with a beer.   Babi guling -  this was okay. shredded braised pork shoulder with some pickled veggies and lettuce wraps to put it all in.   Overall decent meal for a decent price. Would come again for a cocktail and snacks."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out a few weekends ago for 4 people: the 3 satay skewers, Babi kecap, ayam panggang, udang kari, atjar tjampour, 2x nasi gorang and white rice: just enough for 4adults. Need to get the white rice to indulge the leftover sauces! A little pricey for the amount of food you're getting, but the flavors are worth it for the occasional outing. Glad we decided on take-out and not dine-in - can get loud in there! But will definitely go back for other items on the menu and to try some of their fancy drinks!"}
{"text":"Will definitely come back. They have awesome food with great flavor. They are more like share plates than anything. Fills up fast so may need to make a reservation or come when it isn't busy!"}
{"text":"My foodie intuition is really kicking in- I actually spotted this place while dining across the street at St Louis. Place looked pack and people looked generally excited both entering and leaving. I walked in there without any expectation. Asked the cool hipster waitresses what kind of cuisine it is- and was told that its Indonesian.  Mind you, i have no experience with Indonesian food and from first experience; It is love. The waitresses were very knowledgeable and menu was very easy to read. Its one of those places that you go in with a group of 3-4 people and just order everything on the menu as they are all so distinct.   Was a wonderful new culinary experience and I shall definitely be heading back. HIGHLY recommend it."}
{"text":"Polished review on Torontonicity here: http://www.torontonicity.com/2014/07/26/little-sister-food-bar-a-new-indonesian-resto-for-toronto/  Little Sister Indonesian Food Bar, a new Indonesian food restaurant on Yonge Street, just north of Davisville, has been open to the public for three weeks. Torontonicity was invited to the media tasting to taste their wares and experience the restaurant after it has been open for a little while and ironed out any kinks.  Lovely Shannon Shinn, the publicist for the event, greeted me warmly at the door. The immediate ambience is warm and inviting, with soft lighting and mirrors in addition to the distressed wood. Menus are unique, made from corrugated cardboard to keep the atmosphere casual. The co-owner/chef, Michael Van Den Winkel, informed me that he had asked the designer to give the restaurant a grunge chic feel.   Off the Bat:  This is an adult special place that could turn into a \"your place\" restaurant. There are no TVs to distract your date. They offer no delivery, which makes it a distinctive place to dine out. The dishes are not customized to reduce the heat for children's palates. Since dishes take time to prepare, meals are consistent.  Jeremy, the handsome bartender, mixes up a storm with his signature drinks. He was originally employed at the established \"Quince Bistro\" up the street, but was invited to join the team at the more intime Little Sister and jumped at the opportunity. He was hired six weeks prior to the opening and helped varnish floors and get the restaurant ready. You can feel that the staff has an investment in the success of this place and it shows. They have an easy camaraderie and really make patrons feel welcome.  I asked if Jeremy had created the drink himself, but he said he liked to focus on the serving element so Little Sister hired a mixologist to concoct some Indonesian-flavoured drinks to accompany the food.  Michael came to chat with me as his wife, Jenn, was doing throughout the evening. It was a nice touch for the owners to get to know their patrons. Even though it was a media event, I got the impression this may be a regular thing they do. Little Sister Food Bar is the only exclusively Indonesian restaurant in Toronto. Michael is Dutch and hails from Amsterdam. His background as a chef is from working in the navy there. On the naval ships, every Wednesday was deemed Indonesian food night, so he really enjoyed the challenge and excitement of creating new dishes for the crew. He said that Indonesian dishes take about sixteen hours to make because sauces need to be cooked very slowly to infuse the flavours with all the peppery, spicy goodness.  The Food:  The Beef Croquette was delicious. A tasty shell of breadcrumbs breaks open in your mouth to reveal a soft, spicy ragout of beef and spices. Michael calls it Dutch junk food   The Rendang taco was fiery and a little messy.  Babi Panggang is a delicious pork belly served atop of a crispy cracker. The pork is seared on both sides rendering the middle meat velvety moist.  Pangsit is a crispy wonton. Make sure you completely envelope the wonton in the zesty sauce. This was one of my favourites. Delicious.  Satay Ayam is one of the skewers on the menu. It was okay, but not as exciting as the other dishes.  Samur java spicy beef is somewhat lacklustre compared to other dishes. It was tasty though.  Usang kari is a shrimp infused with coconut on a bed of basmati rice. The server said it was her favourite. I can see why.  Sambal Daging is a delicious tamarind braised pork served on top of spicy glass noodles with crispy shallots.  Satay Babi is a pork skewer served on top of coleslaw with a spicy peanut sauce.  The Shrimp Lettuce Wrap is the spiciest dish on the menu, which is deceiving because it's served chilled. The spiciness seemed more of a chili pepper tabasco sort rather than the more complex peppers used in the other dishes. My mouth was humming for about a minute or two after.  The Drinks:  I enjoyed the Little Brother cocktail with the Balinese Shredded Chicken Taco. The peppery drink has a Mount Gay rum base, which gives it the sweet and spicy combination. It complements the peppery taste of the food. The added sprig of mint jauntily added to the glass as a garnish adds panache.  Ubud Hangout was very spicy, but that could be due to the red chili that was been sitting in my glass for a good while!"}
{"text":"Before I rant about the food, let me say that the low rating is definitely contributed by the extremely bad service. The server seems like she'd rather die than be in the restaurant. Which is sad because if the restaurant claims to have Bali vibe, that's the kind of attitude you will never find in Bali. When we're done with our food, she asked us for dessert (which when we look over the menu they don't have any) but we understand it's her way to kick us out. So we agreed to ask for bill. She then proceeded to clean our table so noisily. It's like she's slamming every plates and every utensils like she's angry, ended up dropping some forks on the floor.  On the food: - Nasi Goreng used basmati rice so it feels more like Indian dish. Even the taste is closer to Biryani than Nasi Goreng. 90% of the dish is dominated by the cabbage and so is the taste. - Ikan Belado was not bad. The fish was soft but the sauce was not spicy at all and was more towards sour. - Babi Guling was completely different than what we expected. Tasted more like shredded pork with soy sauce. Maybe change the name into Pulled Pork. - Urab. Is a disappointment. - Satay Lilit dominated with lime taste but it was good. Probably the best dish among what we ordered. We just wonder when we ate it if they put the meat on the wrong side of the skewer.  It's enough for one visit."}
{"text":"Visited Fri May 11 for dinner, they stopped taking reservations when I called that afternoon. Sitting at the communal table was fun, and the decor made me feel like I was indonesia (even though I've never been). Some very unique ingredients which I definitely needed to google to understand what they were.   Pros   Nasi goreng - $6.95 The highlight of our meal was large and flavourful.  Satay ayam - All the skewers come with three, tasty but priced a bit high  Urab - $7.50 comes cold with some unique vegetables, it was a big portion which was unexpected.   Cons   Udang curi - $15.95 for a small bowl of curry, either increase the portion or decrease the price. Not worth the price.  Service was on the slow side, walked in and waited over 5 minutes before we were even recognized. Even after we were seated, another 10 minutes until a server came.  No photos of the food to get a sense of what the food is, definitely ask the servers questions. $4.95 for 1 taco is too rich for me.  Wouldn't come back again unless service improves.   Damage - $45 after tax before tip for 5 dishes."}
{"text":"Little Sister is a food bar that specialize in Indonesian-Dutch cuisine like its sister restaurant, Noorden. The restaurant has a hipster grungy aesthetic. It invokes a street hawker vibe.   The menu is a mix of small plates that's best for sharing. I enjoyed all of the small plates that I have ordered, but there are a few standouts.   The satay babi is delicious and is a signature dish. It features pork smothered in a rich peanut sauce.  I would also recommend the shrimp lettuce wraps and the nasi goreng. The nasi goreng is a delicious bowl of vegetarian fried long-grain rice specked with leeks and white cabbage and packed with flavours of cumin, coriander, sambal and ketjap manis - a must try.   The service was attentive. The price is reasonable for this fun restaurant. In city that is littered with a lot of food bars, Little Sister is a standout."}
{"text":"I recently came here with friends. The overall experience was really good. We were seated at the patio and had a nice dinner as the sun was setting.   Here's what we ordered to share: 1. Satay Sapi: 8/10. These were beef skewers with kecap, like leaf and lemongrass. They were pretty good. 2. Beef croquette (snack): 9/10. 3. Watermelon salad (side): 8/10. This was spicy but oddly appetizing. 4. Semur Java: 9/10. We got this with steamed rice and it was just short of amazing. I would highly recommend this dish."}
{"text":"Comfortable seating, friendly service, and overall good food. I thoroughly enjoyed the cauliflower, nasi goreng, and beef as a main dish. The satays went well with the delicious peanut sauce and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my 7th time at this restaurant.  My first visit was fantastic.  The service was great, the bartender was pleasant and helpful and the food was amazing.  Tonight was a completely different story.  We sat at the bar and the bartender, who was supposed to be our server, was 90% attitude and maybe 10% service. Not only was she not helpful but she was downright rude.  I appreciate that this restaurant wants to give off a \"cool\" vibe and tattoos are fine but not when accompanied by a BAD attitude. Where did all the lovely servers go?? Maybe if the servers had a good/pleasant attitude their appearance would not cross my mind but their appearance and bad attitude seem to go hand in hand. The food has also deteriorated considerably since my first visit.  The beef stew was filled with chunks of fat that were concealed as beef.  The cauliflower salad that used to feed 3 people easily  has shrunken to literally 4 spoonfuls.  It is too bad that this restaurant has so quickly gone downhill.  Aside from going there often myself, I had recommended Little Sister to a number of other people. I would certainly make no such recommendation now."}
{"text":"Holy...eff... one of the best Indonesian restaurants...I walked by this place with my boyfriend and we decided to step in, check it out. and try eating it. The decor is very modern and the music definitely sort of conflicts with the traditional Indonesian cuisine...but hey as long as the food tastes good! Which it did! We both ordered braised beef, nasi goreng (fried rice), roasted pork belly. This restaurant is tapas style so the portions are fairly small to medium sized. Definitely come here to share! I really loved the pork belly, it was fatty, rich, and flavorful. The braised beef was just as good too.   Really nice spot on Yonge street near davisville station. Highly recommend if you're looking for Indonesian food. Located in a great area, service is prompt and friendly as well. Go go Go!"}
{"text":"Never experienced indo food before but OH MY GOD. I was more then impressed with our server but beyond that the food left me planning my next return dinner before I even paid the bill."}
{"text":"I love this spot. It is exotic and welcoming, warm and thrilling all at the same time. Jennifer and Michael have created something in Toronto that is unique. I could say that I have seen it before in Amsterdam, but that wouldn't be quite true. They have created a spot that is as Toronto as Toronto gets. We explore the world, learn and bring back the best with twists that we learn about in our local culture. Little Sister has done that. It is a true local, focused on the street food of Indonesia, amped up by the fine dining sensibilties that Toronto expects. The bonus for me is that I don't have to go downtown to get the edge I desire. They have brought the cool vibe to Yonge and Eglinton. So not only brilliant satay's in jump-up peanut sauce, but also nasi goreng that you can have for breakfast lunch and dinner. There is nothing like this north of King, Queen, Bloor and beyond. The bar is wrapped in an eclectic music-scape as well designed as the cocktails that expert mixologists Jeremy and Kiera nail  every night of the week. Back to the exotic part, there's gin with hot peppers, rum coconut and lemon grass drinks and my personal favorite the Komodo Stinger. A smoked mezcal based cocktail that you'd be hard pressed to find in Manhattan or Mexico City. Cask aged brilliance. And after a libation opens your palate, the pangsit, or the beef  rendang taco, line you up perfectly with larger plates of pork belly and subtlety spiced amyam panggang chicken that you will want an extra order of to take home. The best news about Little Sister, is that it is a place that keeps growing on you and embracing you with all the ambience it brings. It is a new Toronto treasure. I like it so much I don't want to share it."}
{"text":"Here is the punch line: I will never go back here again. Now the explanation:  Between the two of us we ordered 6 dishes so I think that was a fair representation of this place's food. We started with chicken satay which was pretty horrible and requires talent to mess up! Next came the shrimp lettuce wrap, which was the only noteworthy dish of the night. After that we had the braised beef and the pork shoulder, which were stews and were extremely salty. We also tried the grilled fish that was completely burned to the point that it was not edible. The fried rice tasted slightly sweet but was good but it does not go well with the salty stews.  In terms of ambiance, it is rather loud and for some reason they were playing a mix of hip hop/R&B from 2000-2005, which didn't really go well with the middle age clientele.  The service was the only good thing about the whole experience."}
{"text":"This place should be embarrassed as they made NO effort to accommodate a person with small vision issue, Their menu is unreadable, as dark ink on dark brown paper menu, with sparse lighting,  They claimed they did not have a single copy of menu black ink on White paper.  no Washroom on floor, large steps to get in.  Food great but very small portions, cost with one beer $50 too pricey lack of readable menu is a disgrace, They should be ashamed of such unfeeling for the 10% of society, that can't read a artistic menu."}
{"text":"This is a 3 star review for two reasons.  The main one is, like another user said, the size of the dishes. We ordered skewers, 2 chicken tacos, the Pangsit and the Semur Java for two and let's just say we were not full. The problem is the price of some dishes doesn't match their size. The Semur Java comes in a small bowl and is $14.50 dollars. I definitely felt ripped off.  The second one is the food itself. Out of everything we ordered, the skewers were definitely the highlight. Everything else was just OK, inlcuding the $14.50 Semur Java.  I doubt I will be going back, unless they change the concept."}
{"text":"So-so. Food was tasty, but portions are small, luckily the person I was sharing with wasn't very hungry so I ate 80% of what was ordered for two people. Sat at the bar as there were no tables available, bartender was friendly, but I find it a bit sneaky the way they immediately ask if you'd prefer still or sparkling water as you're being seated. $3 extra for sparkling, good thing I asked. When paying, the waitress quickly punched in our total and immediately grabbed my debit card and inserted it for me. I noticed my total was $5 more than my receipt indicated. She laughed it off saying good thing I noticed. May have just been human error, but I don't think so. But regardless let the customer insert their own card after reviewing what they're being charged for. Over all I won't be make a second visit here, bad first impression being seated, and bad last impression while paying."}
{"text":"Amazing Indonesian food in TO! Cozy casual restaurant with friendly and knowledgeable staff. Had the Little Brother cocktail, Nasi Goreng, and Udang curry with shrimp. All were really well-balanced and authentic Indonesian. Coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Stop the presses! I'm reviewing something north of Bloor! And I actually enjoyed it!  Seriously, this place is very cool. Its a smallish restaurant but smartly laid out with stylish decor that has a strategic mix of industrial concrete, smart ethnic inspired wallpaper, and well crafted wall hangings. The menus are freaking cool, being printed on cardboard with unique colorful tape wrapping. And they actually take reservations! Before even getting on to the food or drinks, this place impressed me.  The menu is mostly snack style, which makes for good sharing. We sampled a few things all with good success and I will say their house made hot sauce is delicious (savoury yet spicy). Cocktail menu has some impressive looking drinks but I stuck to their beer selection which is about 5 or 6 Ontario craft brewed options.   I could see this place being a great place be it for dinner or just drinks. Even on a weeknight it was busy though, so I'd recommend putting the reservation feature on their website to work when planning your visit. Even though I don't get to this end of town very often, I can see myself coming back here given the chance."}
{"text":"The food was tasty and we'll presented. The portions are small and expensive.  Atmosphere was nice but  a bit on the pretentious side. Drinks are unique but expensive. A bit over rated."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday this past July. I first discovered this place at taste of toronto and they had the best food at the show. It is phenomenal food and the pork belly is amazing."}
{"text":"It's great to be able to get Indonesian food so close to our home. And it's even better that the quality and the taste of the food is amazing.   Mix the above with the nice and well informed staff and it's definitely a place to go back to more often!   We also like the informal atmosphere in the bar and the have some great (alcohol free) cocktails.   I want to mention that most of the food has a spicy hint but that's typical for the Indonesian kitchen."}
{"text":"We really liked this place, the food was pretty good, the cocktails were reaaallly good (I think we tried all of them) and the service was good."}
{"text":"Little Sister is quite the gem in this neighbourhood. It's easy to walk by without noticing this rather non-descript storefront but once you're inside: it's an intimate, industrial/chic space made even more so with the dim lights. I found it novel that the menus were printed on cardboard, heh. Catch-up with a few friends or make it a date night, ya can't go wrong with Little Sister.  We kicked off dinner with some fried wontons (pangsit) which came with a pungent sauce... which was quite tasty! Then came the braised beef and potatoes (semur java) and fried rice (nasi goreng) - awesome pairing because you can use the sauce from the semur java on the nasi goreng. We also ordered the watermelon as a side which turned out to be rather refreshing against the heavy flavours of the other dishes.  With food and a couple of drinks (beer, negroni), everything came to $60ish (including tax and tip) for two."}
{"text":"Really yummy Indonesian food! One of my favourite places on Yonge Street. Breaks the monotony of sushi or Italian restaurants, that are plenty around Yonge and Eglinton (not that I'm complaining)I really love the idea of sharing dishes, so that way you and your friends can try different flavours. Hip, bohemian interior, service was friendly, definitely would visit again!"}
{"text":"All I can do is repeat what the other great reviews here say.  The food and service here is out of this world.  First of all, stop at Noorden across the street first for drinks and snacks.  This is their sister restaurant and the only place in Toronto to get great Dutch pub food (bitterballen!).  Then stroll a few doors south to Little Sister.  Super lively atmosphere and great Happy Hour specials.  The food was fantastic, especially (as others have mentioned) the nasi goreng and the semur java.  The beef in the semur java, to say nothing of the spices, was perfect.  And very rich.  Two of us shared a serving and we still couldn't finish it (we also got a curried shrimp dish which was delicious as well).  Yeah, this place is a keeper.  Better make reservations, though!  We got there at 5:30 and by 6:30 the place was jam packed."}
{"text":"Just add kecap manis seems to be the kitchen's approach, which nets out to almost every dish having a sickly sweet flavor. Nothing like the Indonesian food you get in Holland (or Indonesia). Something still has my stomach turning the next morning...  The decor is nice, but the side by side booth seating is awkward, and our server was rude."}
{"text":"I'm a little conflicted writing this review.  I definitely enjoyed the food which is served tapas style and is the only authentic Indonesian place in Toronto.   Firstly knowing how busy this place was, I made a reservation.  I showed up at my time and waited at the front....and waited...and waited....for someone..anyone to acknowledge my lowly presence.  Finally I was told the table was almost ready as the people were finishing up.  Well 30 min later our group finally gets seated.    Overall the service was hit and miss.  Our server was definitely friendly and explained the menu to us...but then there would be long lags of when she would come back to check on us.  So not particularly impressed but since I don't want people spitting in my food/drinks I avoid saying anything and just yelp about it :)  I did enjoy the food - I tried the watermelon salad which is a delicious palate cleansing salad - fresh cool taste of the melon mixed in with cilantro (which I love) and some onions and radishes.  I had the Satay Lilit which is a Balinese style of chicken skewer which I found to be ok and the Nasi Goreng - fried rice.  Other people found this dish to be too spicy but not me - this was my favourite - it had hits of sweet and spicy which I just loved.  For me honestly the portion sizes are perfect but I can see how the would be on the smaller end for others.    The menu is broken up into skewers (you get 3 small skewers); snacks and traditional (which would be your main dish) and then sides.  For the 3 dishes I ordered it came up to $20, but that was filling for me.  My drinks however which was the Little Brother was $14!  Reading some of the other reviews it seems it was $12 so they have upped the price.  While good, too expensive IMO.  The place is small but not too small you feel like you are sitting in a cramped space.  It has that soft glow of lights that would just be perfect if you had a date but you had the unfortunate luck to get a pimple - it won't be seen here :)  Overall I'm not sure if I would go back because of the service...but I did want to try a few other things off the menu, so maybe in a few months when I forget the memory of standing in the front door just waiting around for someone to care."}
{"text":"Very small portions for the price. I understand that it's a tapas place, but 4 tiny skewers for $6? It's a rip-off! The service was okay, but our waiter kinda rushed us to leave, because we were there for almost 2 hours and apparently was occupying one of the good tables outside. The food was decent, but I wasn't blown away either.  Service 2/5 Food 4/5 Drinks 5/5 Value for the money 1/5"}
{"text":"This restaurant is cute and exciting for people wanting to try new cuisines, which is the main reason we went. It is very overpriced though, one taco was $5... I wouldn't go here often due to its steep prices, but would definitely recommend everyone to visit at least once. The flavours are unbeatable."}
{"text":"Pretty decent place. Portions were a bit small. I liked the cauliflower dish and braised beef. The seafood wrap and pork belly were decent but not amazing. Very friendly staff and quite packed on a weeknight"}
{"text":"I had hoped that we finally had an Indonesian Restaurant in Toronto again but this isn't it.  The chicken Satay was fine but not outstanding. The Rendang taco was a joke. Very little \"rendang\" about it except that it had beef in it. Both  orders were very small. I was glad I'd ordered the Nasi Goreng as it filled me up, however that wasn't all that tasty either. I realize that Nasi Goreng can be made in many different ways but bland and too greasy shouldn't be one of them. None of the food reminded me in any way of what I've eaten in Indonesia. Given the other positive reviews, I am giving this 3 stars because I assume I am comparing what I expected to get, with what I did get. That isn't precisely fair to the restaurant which is clearly not trying to present authentic Indonesian food."}
{"text":"I went here to celebrate a birthday and reserved a table for 6 people 3 weeks in advance.  However once I got there they seated us at a very small 4 seater table by adding 2 additional chairs.  I was quite disappointed as an older family member was with me and I wanted to ensure they were comfortable.  When I talked to the waiter he was rude and wasnt that apologetic and wasnt able to rationalize well why there was a bigger table that was still available and we were seated at this small table despite having made reservations well in advance.   While their food was good I won't be going back given this poor customer service."}
{"text":"We came here for a bday.   Tapas style Indonesian food. Pretty good! Very similar to food In Bali, but it had a English fusion twist. The pork belly was to die for! Most of the dishes were spicy so non spicy friends beware! It's manageable though.  The cocktails are done with a heavy hand so if you are a light weight, one is all you need!  The dessert selection isn't intensive so I recommend bringing a cake if you are celebrating a bday! We didn't know and had to go somewhere else for dessert.  Reservations recommended as the place is tiny. We were there on a Monday night and had a 2.5 hour time limit before the next reservation."}
{"text":"Decided to get dinner with a couple of my girlfriends on the recommendation of a friend and I cannot find one bad thing to say about the place, the food or the drinks. The staff was extremely warm and welcoming and accommodated us even though we didn't have a reservation. They had even opened up the small but cute patio area for the summer!   We started with some cocktails which were made to perfection. The concoction as well as the presentation was impeccable. They are on the expensive side but I assure you they are not the run of the mill cocktails you are served at downtown bars. I got the Ubud Hangout cocktail and liked it so much, I ordered seconds. It's the right blend of spicy and sweet and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a little kick to their cocktails.   The food was great too! We got several small plates and decided to share. My top three 1. Pork belly 2. Cauliflower salad 3. Nasi goreng which would go well with any of the curries on the menu. If you just wanna try one thing, try the pork belly! We ended with dessert which was again unique.   Great little place near Yonge and Eg. I for one will definitely be going back here! Nice little spot for smaller group. Might be a little tight for groups larger than 5-6 people."}
{"text":"Nice vibe and friendly staff. Seemingly a great addition to the Yonge and Eg area. The food was good not great and I kept thinking that this place would not compete at Ossington and Dundas. Will give it another try."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place more but I felt that even thought the food tasted great, the portions were very small! I expected a lot more for the prices we paid.   Nevertheless I would recommend ordering the Nasi Goreng as it was perfection! The flavors were robust, the long grain rice added an extra special quality to it, and the spices were just at the right level.   From a design standpoint, the furnitures were beautiful, contemporary yet playful and the interior was inviting and unique!"}
{"text":"Little Tapas style place. Indonesian. Try it. I have been there a few times. I love the interior."}
{"text":"My roommate and I came here on a Thursday night - great ambiance, cocktails, food, people. we had the 'bali red eye' cocktail and some tacos. Ginger infused vodka? Heck yes. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Our visit to this restaurant started out a bit rough. Although we had a reservation, we were left standing near the front door for what (felt like) 20 minutes.  It wasn't that we weren't acknowledged; they were just so incredibly busy and had trouble seating us. They were kind enough to give us some drinks, but I'm at the end of the third trimester and would have loved a seat!  So why the 5 stars? Once we were seated the service was good and the food was amazing. Everything was beautifully spiced. We ordered nearly everything on the menu. The only thing I would avoid is the beef wontons. The chilli lime sauce was delicious but the beer wontons just didn't work. All other sides, snacks, and traditional plates were soooo good! I also ordered a virgin cocktail and cannot wait to try their drinks. mmmmm I wish I was there right now stuffing my face :)"}
{"text":"Loved the food. We had the skewers, coconut shrimp and the pork belly. They were all amazing. I would definitely recommend!!   Portions could be bigger however or come with at least some sides or even just rice."}
{"text":"The bar tender is really great and the drinks are so delicious :) everything on the menu is yummy too! I like the Shrimp Lettuce wraps and the shrimp curry in particular. Some items are a little spicy so make sure you order the watermelon salad to cool you off :)"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great ambience. Nice to to have a great restaurant like this in North Toronto."}
{"text":"For my 100th review, I wanted to write about a restaurant that never fails to blow me away. Little Sister is a small, unassuming joint that consistently prepares some of the best food in Toronto.  This time around, I ate:  Satay Lillit (Balinese Spiced Chicken): This is one of three skewers on offer and it is, no surprise, delicious. It arrived without sauce, which I initially found concerning, but one bite told me that no sauce was required. The meat was tender and juicy, and so flavorful, too. A perfect start to the meal.  Fried Cauliflower Salad (Rujak, Green Onion, Puffed Rice): I would eat cauliflower every day if this is how it was prepared. So good.  Babi Guling (Crispy Balinese Pork Wrap, Pickles, Peanuts): Oh my god. This is essentially a lettuce wrap that you assemble yourself and it might just be the best version of this dish I've ever had. The meat is the real star here, since it's cooked in a way that the pork is irresistibly crispy without becoming dry. The accompanying hot sauce is perfect and just spicy enough, while the \"pickles\" are actually delicious pieces of pickled melon. (I thought it was celery when the plate first arrived!)  Nasi Goreng: Their version of fried rice, this is something I order every time I'm at Little Sister. It's quite literally the best fried rice I've ever eaten and honestly, I could eat it every day of my life. It's a perfect accompaniment to the next two dishes.  Udang Kari (Shrimp Coconut Curry): This was my first time eating this dish but now I feel like it'll become a regular thing. Imagine the best shrimp curry you've ever had and then multiply it a few hundred times and you'll have this dish. It's rich and flavorful and the huge shrimp are cooked perfectly.  Semur Java (Javanese Dark Spiced Braised Beef, Crispy Potato, Green Onion): Like the Nasi Goreng, I order this every time I come to the restaurant. It's a saucy, addictive dish that contains the softest beef you could imagine. I love it.  I've noticed quite a few reviews complaining about the prices. Yes, Little Sister isn't a cheap restaurant, but when you're getting quality at this level, it's actually an insane bargain. (I would pay more for these dishes.)"}
{"text":"The picture below was $16 per dish not including delivery. I got two small pieces of chicken and 3 pieces of beef. You definitely don't get value or quality with this place. It's guaranteed that I will never go back."}
{"text":"Came with a few friends. Shared all three skewers, curry shrimp, shrimp wrapped in lettuce, beef taco, pork belly and fried rice.  Food is tasty, service is great! However I find the portion is quite abit small.  Definitely come with couple friends to share a variety of dishes."}
{"text":"I can only comment on the food, which I tasted at the Taste of Toronto event.  (I have not been to the restaurant itself). I can honestly say that the best thing I have eaten in a long time is the olive oil poached tuna with crispy quinoa and slaw. I consider myself a true foodie and this dish was crazy good; I got it twice at the event. I also tried a pork salad bowl at the event that was very, very good. If I lived in Toronto, i think I'd be eating at Little Sister's all the time."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure to drive up to Toronto and visit Little Sister this past weekend, and (poetically enough), gave our \"little sister\" her first taste of Indonesian food. I chose Little Sister partly because of its proximity to our lodging and partly because of the raving reviews it got from other people who had had Indonesian food before. It's been a while since my last taste of real Indonesian food, and I was excited, hopeful, and a touch nervous.   The restaurant is a bit smaller than I had expected. It gave off a somewhat intimate but casual vibe that is friendly instead of romantic. It could be a date place, certainly, but it doesn't have to be. The interior design is peppered with just enough traditional Balinese motifs without any of it being overdone. It's as if a Balinese had come in person to decorate the place with materials from the homeland. It was enough to give me a flashback to some of the eateries I had gone to with my family in Bali.  At this point, I was very excited. Then we saw the menu and were told that food in Little Sister is meant for sharing; guests could order many dishes and share them. By the time food came, our excitement about tripled and quadrupled. We had the chicken satay, babi panggang, babi guling, rendang taco, beef croquette, curry shrimp, and a side order of nasi goreng.  I have to say that just about all of the dishes that we ordered had their flavor and texture very much spot on despite the not-so-traditional presentation. The nasi goreng is not as spot on, but the flavor profile is still pretty close (both my dinner companions swore it was the best fried rice they had ever had on this side of the planet).   At our urging, our sister also ordered the two desserts of the day, ginger coffee ice cream and coconut pudding. While neither are traditional Indonesian food, the flavor profiles are definitely there.   I think that's what Little Sister is. It's not trying to be authentic or fake being authentic. Instead, it takes flavor profiles that are much beloved and transform them into something unique that people who crave Indonesian flavors can still appreciate, and people who don't know Indonesian flavors can also appreciate. And for that, I am thankful.  Anyway. Little Sister is located in midtown, so parking spot is prime estate.  If you decide to come during dinner rush, be prepared to hunt for a while for a spot. Also, you may have to wait for a table unless you call ahead and make a reservation.   Is it worth it though? I'll leave it to you to decide. As for us, we're definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Dinner at Little Sister was the perfect welcome back following a trip to Indonesia, while also satisfying my love for tapas and delicious cocktails.  DECOR: Funky, small, and laidback. It's not a big place but there's also a balcony open when the weather is nicer.   STAFF: The waitresses seemed to be having alot of fun. They were friendly and helpful, and were happy to talk about the dishes with us.   FOOD: Portion sizes are on the smaller side of course, being tapas and all. However, after splitting a few meat dishes, I was very satisfied. - Satay lilet skewers: Balinese spiced chicken skewers. So tender. - Grilled mustard greens: For a serving of vegetables, pretty darn tasty. Sharp and crunchy. - Balinese shredded chicken tacos: OMG. The soft saucy chicken. The fried shallots. I could've had  like 10 of these and called it a meal. - Babi pagggang: Roasted pork belly with a chili sauce. Non-negotiable. You must order this. it was one of the most perfectly cooked pork bellies I've ever tried, and the chili sauce packed just the right amount of sweet and heat.  - Nasi goreng: Just like I had in Bali! Can't go wrong with fried rice. - Semur java: This was a dark Javanese braised beef with crispy potatoes and green onions. The sauce was a bit too thick for my liking, but it tasted great and the beef itself was perfect. The crispy potatoes were complementary to the thick sauce and the green onions added a fresh kick.  - Tamarind sours: Whiskey sours are my favourite cocktail, so a hit of tamarind and bitters was a nice addition.   Overall, the food was really great and a nice change from the usual meat & potatoes fare. Price point was reasonable too. I can't wait to come back and try the rest of the tapas and some new drinks!"}
{"text":"Food was sub-par at best. The only wow thing was their cauliflower - couldn't get enough of it. The watermelon salad was meh, the skewers were ok, the tacos were good. The chicken main and the shrimp curry were SMALL - I get that you are a tapas style, sharing menu restaurant. But to charge $15 for 4 shrimp in a coconut sauce is kind of outrageous. The portions were really small and pricey. I would only come back for the cauliflower.  The service was ok. Our server rolled our eye at my friend who took a picture of the food. Understand that might be annoying - but the job of a server is to be fake and pleasant.   Making a reservation is also really annoying. Not worth the trip up to Davisville."}
{"text":"This trendy 'little' restaurant has the right mix of hip vibes mixed with down scale elegance.   The food is great and everything tasted was amazing! Most plates are small, so order 5 between 2 people and you can't go wrong.   Don't think about leaving without having a cocktail out two either. The bartender has the skills and really crafts up some great drinks.  Definitly a place to hit up again to taste more of the menu!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot about the place - including on the of top 5 new places in Toronto.  The one thing to know is have a reservation unless you are eating at 5:30.  The kitchen closes at 10 on weeknights and 11 on weekends.  Only a dinner place.  The evening is enveloped in this one comment from our table of 8 - \"It's heaven wrapped in a soft taco\"  The food is amazing, the servers worked with a vegetarian at the table to make sure they had plenty to eat, and dealt with our reordering of the favourites at the table.  We ordered EOTM x 2 or 3.  Everything on the menu is the way to go with a big group.  Not one dish was disappointing.  Many were raved and ordered again - the lettuce wraps, the tacos, the pork bellies - even the fried rice.  The food has a great blend of unusual spices - so its flavourful not spicy.  More spice on the table if you want.  A great find in my 'hood and looking forward to introducing many to this amazing place.  Come hungry."}
{"text":"The good: I can go on forever of this place. They have one of the best skewer I have tried. Full of flavour, full of spice. The shrimp lettuce wrap surprisingly went well with each other. Semur java (braised beef) was nice and moist Mmm - pair it with a nasi goreng and boom! Your life will be satisfied. And just when you thought dinner was just too awesome... Wait till you hit the dessert :) the coconut pudding with palm sugar sauce was amazing. The other dessert I had was a ginger ice cream but it was very light and good!!  The bad: that my stomach was too small to eat all the dishes  The ugly: I didn't have to wait, but even on a weekday the place can be packed!  The neutral: drinks were pretty good! I am no expert on alcoholic beverages but the burnt pineapple sour and the tamarind sour were quite good. Awesome place to bring a date or a table for two. Harder to accommodate for groups but doable if reserved :)"}
{"text":"I did not read any reviews or check this place out before I came in here and that is not how I usually roll. However, I was in the area and needed to kill an hour or so and this place had people sitting inside so I decided to check it out. My mama always said, if a restaurant is empty and it's dinner time, RUN! Well, this place was bustling and they had just one table left for us to grab so this place must be decent.  Anyways, was planning on just grabbing a drink and an appetizer because we had dinner plans after. However, once we tried the chicken skewers, we couldn't stop! The flavour is amazing and it totally opened up our appetite! We ended up also getting the beef and pork tacos, and the beef croquettes, all of which were all excellent. Loved it! We also couldn't decide what to drink so the bartender made us a lil something something both of which tasted great.  Seriously, so happy to find this place. It has good chill hipster vibes, friendly service, decent prices, and right at yonge and eglinton! Looking forward to my next visit to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"I came here last Sunday for a friend's birthday dinner. The staff didn't seem too pleased to see us enter through the door past 9pm. Already I felt I was inconveniencing the kitchen, which doesn't stimulate the appetite. After sitting we were told every 10 minutes for the next 45 minutes that it's last call/ late. You'd think we came in at 10pm rather than an hour before closing.   We ordered - Fried Cauliflower Salad -  Crunchy, flavorful and surprisingly really good. A veritable fusion win.  -Watermelon Salad -  Not as great and refreshing as i was hoping it would be. I think it's because it was made a day before or not from the best watermelon.  - Nasi Goreng -  Having grown up in the Netherlands where many Indonesians now also live, I have certainly had better nasi goreng -Satay Ayam - the chicken was dry. Since this is such a big dish in Indonesia, I was surprised what a meh job they did of it.  - Semur Java - This was the best meat dish. Love the robust beef flavors and spices in this.  -Ayam Penggang - Again the chicken was overcooked and dry. and I drank a Kaffir Me Cocktail  -  I enjoyed it, though it wasn't remarkable.   Our waitress was friendly and bubbly, but definitely was passing on the message that the rest of the staff wanted to leave.  I wouldn't come back again due to that reason, and because the food wasn't spectacular enough for a repeat visit and trip to midtown."}
{"text":"One of my good friends is Indonesian so we decided to check out Little Sister together. I called on Thursday for reservations, but they were already booked so the staff member of LS suggested that I take pot luck and go in as a walk in on Saturday night. We arrived at around 8 o'clock on Saturday night; it was packed and was told that we would have to wait. Luckily there's a Starbucks down the street so my pal and I killed time there. By 9 o'clock, our table was ready and Little Sister was still quite packed. The look is minimalist here; however, the place manages to pull off a funky-hipster look. My pal and I ordered a number of dishes and shared (tapas style). As for the food, I found everything we ordered to be pretty good; the skewers were especially delicious. My pal said that the food here isn't authentic, but I guess L.S. is trying to cater to Canadians. I can't wait to check this place out again.  Good for: dinner, night out"}
{"text":"Little Sister is definitely a gem in the Yonge/Eglinton area.  This is a tapas-style Indonesian restaurant, and it's pretty authentic if you ask me!   I came here with two others on a Tuesday evening and it was packed. The restaurant is narrow and small, so it's easy to miss on Yonge St. if you've never been there before.  For three people, it came to approximately $25 per person plus gratuity and the portions were enough to make us full.    We ordered the satay lilit, shredded chicken taco, sambal daging (tamarind braised pork), cauliflower salad, nasi goreng, and the ayam panggang (sweet chili grilled chicken). All were delicious! One of the chefs was also kind enough to give us a complimentary order of shrimp chips while we were sitting by the kitchen bar area.  I would definitely come here again whenever I'm up for flavourful and spicy Indonesian food!"}
{"text":"I would give this place a solid 3.5 stars; it's good, but nothing that would make me rush to come back. The plates are for sharing; we shared two chicken dishes (one of them a satay), one shrimp lettuce wrap and one watermelon salad. Plates were spicy, and good, but nothing stupendous. I had the coconut desert, which again was good, but not sublime. The strawberry drink was probably my favourite part of the dinner. Service was very friendly and knowledgeable. I didn't like having to share a table with strangers; that was a big downside. It's trendy, glad I tried it, but there is so much competition in the area, that I wouldn't come back too soon."}
{"text":"We went for a drink in the upstairs lounge and would've preferred to stay there all night, it's so sweet, the servers were great and the ambiance is intimate and I loved the decor. We tried the shrimp lettuce wraps and skewers, both good also, the cocktails were delicious. Downstairs we shared various plates including the cauliflower salad, more skewers, beef short rib and their coconut dessert. All delicious and we will definitely be going back. Interesting that different cocktails are offered downstairs. I had a smoked old fashion upstairs and downstairs I took our waiters recommendation and opted for the midtown, so good!"}
{"text":"Lived up to the hype.. And some. The atmosphere is amazing, with mix of communal tables, bar seating and separate tables. Very trendy tapas style share plates and excellent service! Our super friendly waitress was very knowledgeable on the menu and had great recommendations. Oh you're wondering about the food? Well let's just say it is good enough that you'd be coming back for more without all the positives I've mentioned above! The satay ayam, rendang taco, shrimp curry, cauliflower salad, pork belly and fried rice dishes I recommend -  as I had the luxury of having them all. Make sure to call in advice to reserve a spot or you'll be out of luck (waiting awhile).. Was a great spot to celebrate the first Friday of the new year."}
{"text":"I went to little sister last night and  was very impressed with the decor and vibe from this place, felt like I was in the Ossignton area with the hipster vibe. We ordered about 4 tapas plates each and a desert as well. Everything the waitress recommended was amazing, the only thing I found expensive was the 14 dollar cocktails."}
{"text":"I don't know if my review is fair because I am basing it on ONE dish from \"Taste of Toronto\" and not even at the restaurant...but the \"Pork Salad\" was SO good. Definitely makes me want to"}
{"text":"I organized a group dinner here recently and was thrilled to see so many other cool Yelpers show up. I started with the Little Brother cocktail, which tasted kind of like a ginger homeopathic remedy. I liked it and would consider ordering another, but I love ginger, so bear that in mind if you're trying something here.   Service was excellent, although it did take me a few tries to get a decent reservation, since I had to book a few weeks in advance. This place is busy, yet the waitress for our table never strayed far and spent a considerable amount of time pouring water refills and making sure things moved along to our liking.  We tried everything on the menu - my most memorable highlights include Javanese dark spiced braised beef, watermelon salad, beef croquettes and the shrimp coconut curry. The \"Dutch\" side of the menu is a bit light - I'm surprised they don't have more dessert options with so much inspiration to choose from! The coconut pudding didn't have much flavor but they chocolate mousse/ice cream is pretty good, albeit neither really Dutch nor Indonesian.  It does get pricy. I'm not really a tapas fan because that style of eating seems more like snacking - very tiny portions for entrée-size prices. Overall we didn't leave hungry but the cost per person was much higher than I had anticipated because we needed to order enough for our group. I know tapas is on trend, and in this neighborhood, it's a sure bet for big profits.   Bathrooms are clean, well lit, and located at the bottom of some very steep stairs. Pretty standard Toronto set-up - watch your step!"}
{"text":"Had somewhat higher expectations based on some of the reviews. Food was just ok, pricey for the amount you get and didn't feel like authentic Indonesian experience, rather a gentrified fusion tapas version. I might stop by for a drink if in the area again but definitely not if I'm looking for Indonesian food."}
{"text":"*I had an issue with the service so I wrote my experience on my own site. I noticed later the restaurant blocked me on their social media accounts. Really professional here.  *The menu was printed on pieces of cardboard and it would have been helpful if there was some pictures on the menu to help customers decide what to get, or at least an indication of spicy dishes! *the food was delicious and flavorful, however the price and service really let me down. *I understand that this is a tapa-style restaurant, but considered that I almost paid $20 for a dish that was just a size of an appetizer, I didn't think it was worth it  -Krupuk with peanut sauce - $5:  I actually didn't order the krupuk. A server offered me this dish and this was his exact words: \"Would you like some prawn crackers to snack on while looking at the menu?\" Please note that he offered the same thing to every other tables as well. With that said, I found out that the dish actually costed $5, and our server did not mention the price at all! I understand I should have questioned when I received the bill, but at the same time as a person who used to be in the service industry, I found this behavior to be intolerable. $5 might be small but it added up considered how expensive the food were, so please restrain from this kind of practice and be honest with your customers!  Anyhow, the krupuk or prawn crackers didn't have a strong prawn/shrimps flavor like the ones in Thai restaurants, but the sauce was delicious! It had a nice combination of spicy and sweetness.  -Watermelon Salad - $7.50 If you're expecting the regular sweet and tangy watermelon salad, then you're in for a real surprise! The salad was packed with heat, luckily the fresh mint and basil helped to calm the spiciness and lightened up the dish. The Sambal vinaigrette added a savoury touch to the salad and I was surprised at how I couldn't smell the shrimp paste or fish sauce - which typically is part of the sambal vinaigrette.  -Babi Kecap (Soy + Ginger braised pork shoulder) - $13.50 While the babi kecap was the less spicier dish out of everything we had that night, it was still hefty on flavorful marinates and spices! The pork shoulder was oh-so-tender and melt in your mouth goodness... I liked how the ginger wasn't too overpowering and the soy sauce was thick, which gave the gravy a nice consistency, perfect to eat with some steam rice :p!  -Semur Java ( Javanese dark spiced braised beef, crispy potato, green onion) - $15.25 Samur java was somewhat lacklustre compared to other dishes due to the heavy spice mix, which I think contained nutmeg or something along the line that was too overbearing. The meat wasn't as tender as the babi kecap either, it was quite tough to chew on. I thought the crispy potato was unnecessary as it added no flavor to the dish, it would have been better if they included chunk of potatoes to soak up the gravy!  -Nasi Goreng - $6 Since both of the previous dishes didn't come with a side of rice, I decided to order a side of nasi goreng to fill us up. While the dish was essentially a fried rice, it was incredibly aromatic with the combinations of chili, garlic and shallot aromas. The rice wasn't too oily and while it had a kick of heat, the sweet soy sauce toned down the chili."}
{"text":"Food was good and flavors were nice, but $15 for a small bowl of coconut shrimp curry that doesn't come with rice? Sorry but I can get the same quality food and x3 the portion at other Indonesian restaurants for $15.  Service was good and atmosphere was nice, but way too pricey for what it was. I guess price is also a reflection of the area.   I'd only come back to get a drink and maybe something small to eat with friends (didn't try the drinks) ."}
{"text":"Located north of Davisville on Yonge, it's a piece of hipster downtown Ossington north of Bloor. The place is small yet very chilled out and you can spend hours sipping on their amazing cocktails made by Jeremy. The food is very flavorful and every bite took me back to my visit to Bali last year. A must try is the chicken skewers, beef tacos, fried rice and pork belly, you will not be disappointed! The servers are very knowledgeable and make you feel at home. I have been twice and will definitely visit again to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"From the same owners as Noorden up the street, Little Sister gives you a smaller, cozier and less formal environment to have Indo-Dutch tapas style foods.    The food here is good. Some of the staple Indo dishes aren't on the menu, but it's still an interesting fusion menu for the North American palate. Be ready for intense bursting flavours. Their menu is quite large, the portions and price is quite reasonable and the drink menu is very interesting.    Overall, a decent place for the area."}
{"text":"I went to Little Sister earlier this afternoon at around 4:30 before the rush. We had the two tacos on the menu along with the ginger and soy pork shoulder. All of the dishes were amazing! Good flavor and the pork was very tender. We (two of us) were quite full from the pork dish and the two tacos, surprisingly. We also had two dessert dishes: the coconut pudding and then the coffee/ginger ice cream - both were delicious! Overall, I liked the ambience, décor, and the staff were really friendly. I'd definitely go to this place again!"}
{"text":"Little Sister is located on Yonge, south of Eglinton and is the only restaurant in Toronto that offers authentic Indonesian cuisine, and they have opted to serving the food tapas-style (i.e., small plates). Little Sister is the sibling (no pun intended) of Quince Bistro (located steps away).  Both restaurants are owned by Jennifer Gittins and Michael van den Winkel, and also share the same culinary team.   Vibe Although Little Sister is small, it is not small enough to feel like you are getting to know your neighbor a little too well: \"Yeah sure! Sit on my lap!\" \"Of course I want to hear your whole conversation! Who does not love hearing about global warming and kittens?\" Though small, you had enough privacy to engage with your guest(s), and tune out those around you.   Plan I knew coming in that the food would be served on small plates, so my friend and I decided to each order at least one skewer, 2 snacks, two mains (they call them \"traditionals\") and 2 sides.  But first we started with a drink. I am usually not a cocktail drinker because I detest sugary drinks that remind me of boxed fruit punch, but when I see tequila as an ingredient, I can't help but become curious. So I ordered the Little Brother ($12) and my friend ordered the Bali Red Eye ($10).   Dishes we chose: Satay Ayam: Chicken skewer with peanut sauce $6  I liked this dish but did not love it. I wanted the sauce to be spicier, and with more fresh herbs. But I am also one of those people who loves fresh herbs on all of my curries and sauces-bring on the cilantro! My friend on the other hand loved how it was not TOO spicy, and did not feel it lacked herbs. So there you have it. You can't please everyone!  Pangsit (Jakarta wontons, beef, green onion, chili lime sauce) $6.25  This was our favorite dish. We received it steaming hot, and it had a super crispy exterior with well-seasoned meat in the center. I also loved the spicy sauce that came with it. In fact, I loved the sauce so much, that I dipped all the other food in it.  Balinese Breaded Chicken Taco: Lettuce, pickled cucumbers, crispy shallots, and sour cream $4.75  Although I ordered this taco, my friend ate it! Grrr. But she swore that it was delicious, though it would benefit from more hot/chili sauce. In fact, a gentleman sitting near us commented that this taco is his favorite dish on the menu.  **Note, you are given many hot sauce options to choose from, so if you do not see it on your table, request it or grab it from the bar.  Rendang Taco: Beef, coconut crema, lettuce, pickled red onion $4.75  The meat was very tender and the sweetness of the coconut cream was nice. However, because I am used to eating tacos on corn tortillas, and I like more cilantro on my tacos with a fair amount of hot sauce, I felt torn.  One can argue that I was making an unfair comparison to what some may deem to be between apples and oranges. Fact is, if I wanted Mexican tacos, I should be going to a Mexican restaurant for them. I think it's important to remember that just because it says \"taco,\" that it does not mean that it will be your standard Mexican-style taco-which can be a very good thing. Live a little!  Ayam Panggang: Sweet chili grilled chicken, bean sprouts, green onion, cilantro $12.50  This was my friend's dish and she loved how tender the chicken was and how it was perfectly charred (fine line between charred and burnt). She also enjoyed the balance of flavors-had enough of a chili kick without having to reach for a glass of water. I also did not mind the chicken, but I found it a bit dry and I wanted it spicier. I think with rice I would have loved it.  Babi Panggang: Roasted pork belly, pickled bean sprouts, fresh chili sauce $15.75  This was the last dish we received, and by this point, we were stuffed. Although I was full, I was blown away by how tender the meat was, and the different flavors that seem to have been infused into the meat. This was literally, melt-in-your mouth tender. Again, I would have liked it with rice. But on its own it was still fabulous. Only major complaint is the price.  Fried Cauliflower Salad: Rujak, green onion, puffed rice $7.50  The salad was delicious, but the reason I did not love it is because when I read \"fried\" I was expecting more contrast in textures; I was expecting the cauliflower to be crispy. I guess because there was sauce on the plate, it was absorbed by the cauliflower which affected the texture. The crispy puffed rice certainly helped negate some of my disappointment.  Watermelon Salad: Chili, mint, basil, sambal vinaigrette $7.50    My friend and I loved this salad. We called it our \"palette cleanser\". I almost feel like this salad should be mandatory (minus the onions-oh how I hate onions).  This is a perfect dish to eat in-between plates due to its fresh and clean taste.

{"text":"We love Indonesian food and after reading the great reviews for this place, our expectations were high.   The grilled fish and the mustard greens were delicious, and the Rendang tacos were good, if on the cold side. But the Nasi Goreng was inedible, due to what we both agreed was an over-abundance of something salty, kecap manis, perhaps, or maybe fish sauce. It was blood- pressure-raisingly salty, as if the salt shaker had fallen into the wok. Anyway, we asked if they could redo it. A few seconds later, the server brought back our partially eaten bowl and said \"the chef prepares it to his own taste so if he made it again it would probably be the same\". I.e. you don't know wtf you're talking about.  Even if it WAS the way it was supposed to be (and I'm pretty sure it wasn't) I would have thought the kitchen might try to make an adaptation for a customer who found the dish inedible. And if the chef had too much attitude to to fix the problem, the server could at least simply offered to take it off our bill, rather than try to \"educate\" us, or pass on the kitchen's message.    Then, to add insult to injury, at the end of our meal, I got up to go get our car, as my partner had an injury and couldn't walk. Clearly, the staff had pegged us as troublemakers, and failing to see that one of us was still at the table, and pulling out his wallet settle the bill,  one of the servers yelled out \"You need to PAY sir!\", as if I was dining and dashing.   I think I will wait 'til I'm in Amsterdam again before trying Indonesian food, methinks."}
{"text":"Delicious but very expensive. The portions are exceptionally small but it kind of evens out with the quality of food. Be wary of the pictures they show on the website, the portions are about as big as a handful. Do not come here expecting a meal."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed every dish last time I tried this restaurant. My second visit was a little disappointing in terms of how good the food was.   We ordered: -Satay Ayam (chicken skewers in a peanut sauce) -Pangsit (fried wonton) -Beef Croquettes -Nasi Goreng (fried rice) -Shredded Chicken Taco -Rendang Taco (beef taco)  I still liked Beef Croquettes and Pangsit; but the other dishes were just okay. We should have ordered something to go with Nasi Goreng, because the fried rice on its own wasn't very flavourful. I also didn't like the sour taste in the shredded chicken taco. Chicken skewers were very average, too. I might want to return to this restaurant to try their curry, but I probably wouldn't order the other dishes again."}
{"text":"I had such a delightfully fun time here last friday! My experience with Dutch-Indonesian food was this cute take out restaurant on Cambie street in Vancouver.  *sigh* I wonder how they fared after the whole Cambie street expansion to the airport */sigh*  My dinner companion has been here before so I let him choose the plates. We ordered the bottle of the rose and that complemented the spice/food very, very well. We ordered: *prawn crackers - would not recommend them. I know there was peanut sauce included. Not interested. *beef croquettes - it's a breaded roll of beef, is the best way I can describe it. It was tasty *beef tacos - soft shell beef tacos. I definitely recommend it. It was the nice amount of spice. I hope you are noticing the trend in my review.  *curry prawn - definitely recommend it *fried rice - I was disappointed. I have very high expectations for what is a humble dish!  It was not bad though *watermelon salad - very refreshing  This is a great place to come here with friends and share the multiple dishes. There are also entres in case you dislike sharing!  The only thing I will criticize is their pathetic website. They seem to have bought the domain and the link on the image is not directing to anything yet. Their website consists of their image! Get on it and update it!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and I finally got the chance to review this place. Each of my visit had been superb in terms of service and quality of the food. Not to mention the ambience is very cozy and casual with a hint of romance because of the dimmed lights   Staff here are very friendly and very efficient - they know their stuff and will give you recommendations if needed. As well, I haven't gotten a wrong order for the times I've visited.  Love the drinks from here - classic with a twist - and strong. I only wish that the drinks were a bit bigger or the prices lower  This place is a tapas style so going here with friends and sharing is ideal. My friends and I (7 of us) got speedy service and the food came out pipping hot and delicious! We practically ordered everything on the menu: nasi goreng, beef and chicken tacos, shrimp wraps, cauliflower salad, skewers, beef croquettes, shrimp coconut curry, Babi kecap (pork), and semur Java (beef) - they all tasted very well made and flavourful! My least favorite was the Babi kecap but everything else I enjoyed thoroughly! We also got their desserts-of-the-day and again, was not disappointed"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night with a friend and it wasn't even 6pm and the place was packed. We ordered the watermelon salad, the Nasi Goreng, the braised beef, the chicken skewer and the shrimp tacos. We loved how refreshing the salad tasted and the tacos had a really good spicy kick to it. The service was also really great and staff was attentive. The only thing I didn't really like was the seating area, we were seated along the side of the restaurant across from the bar and the seats were designed for more intimate occasions. My friend and I found it hard to converse because the seats weren't very comfortable. But other than that, it was a very enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed my experience - from service; to food; to atmosphere. The Nasi Goreng was a delightful surprise; the fried cauliflower salad was just as delicious as promised; and the Satay and the Semur Java were flavourful and unique.  I will definitely be back to sample the rest of the menu. A must try. Remember the rice!"}
{"text":"I couldn't help but feeling ripped off by the entire experience at Little Sister! We came in with a group of friends and each spent around $40 only to leave the place feeling underwhelmed and ...hungry! We were told by the waitress that the food come in little portions so we could order the entire menu for ourselves. And, unfortunately, she was right. I understand the restaurant wants to go with tapas style, but the portions were ridiculously small for the price. I ordered the pork belly dish which was priced at $16 and what I got was four tiny slices of pork. My friend also pay the same price for a small piece of fish.  Quality-wise, the food was ok, nothing really special. None of the dishes really stood out even though we pretty much ordered 2/3 of the menu. Just to sum up, two thumbs down for Little Sister and I will never come back."}
{"text":"One of my pet peeves is leaving a restaurant still hungry. Unless you are willing to take out a loan, this will probably be the case for you too at Little Sister. Overall, the food was not bad, with interesting flavors. The place is hip and buzzing. The music selection was very good. But the size of the tapas-style dishes were so minute, it was almost insulting. We came in a group of 6, and spent $250 (w/ 1 drink pp) and we all left still very hungry. Plus, the service leaves something to be desired. Because of those reasons, I had to give Little Sister such a low rating.  At any rate, if you do want to splurge, I guess it's an interesting dining experience. As such, below I rate the dishes based on taste only, not the value.  SATAY LILET (Chicken) 6.50 Rating: 1/5 Verdict: Teeny tiny skewers of unappetizing \"spongy chicken\".  SATAY SAPI (Beef) 7.50 Rating: 1/5 Verdict: Teeny tiny skewers of unappetizing \"spongy beef\".  WATERMELON SALAD 7.50 Rating: 4/5 Verdict: Very tasty and refreshing salad, but a very tiny portion.   SWEET SPICY PEANUTS 2.00 Rating: 4/5 Verdict: Quite good. The only thing that was actually a good value.  PANGSIT JAKARTA WONTONS, BEEF, 6.75 Rating: 3/5 Verdict: Ok, not very memorable. Small.  ROASTED PORK BELLY, PICKLED BEAN, SPROUTS, FRESH CHILI SAUCE 15.75 Rating: 3/5 Verdict: OK. Not the best pork belly I've ever had.   BALINESE SHREDDED CHICKEN TACO LETTUCE, PICKLED CUCUMBER,  CRISPY SHALLOT SOUR CREAM 4.75 Rating: 2/5 Verdict: OK, not great. Poor value.  NASI GORENG 6.00 Rating: 2/5 Verdict: Nothing special about this fried rice. It's smaller than what you get as a complimentary dish of steamed rice in a Chinese restaurant, for $6. You do the math.  SEMUR JAVA JAVANESE DARK SPICED BRAISED BEEF, CRISPY POTATO, GREEN ONION 15.25 Rating: 4/5 Verdict: Nice and flavorful. Very small."}
{"text":"Yeah. Overdue. Indonesia has the most underrepresented cuisine per capita. Worth a try. Pretty cool. My chef buddy sat at the chefs table and was hyped about it (not ideal for a hot summer day). It wasn't too hard to get a spot there. Drinks are kinda interesting, food is funky-dece. Lots of little dishes worth trying. Got some satay-esque stuff etc... Enjoyed the use of watermelon. Yee."}
{"text":"Maybe the best restaurant in Davisville, Little Sister is our go-to restaurant for a night out in the neigbourhood. It's always busy, even on weeknights. The room is interesting, including a couple of seats at the back looking into the kitchen done up to look like a food stall.  The menu includes small plates as well as larger mains. The best are the beef tacos, spicy wontons, and nasi goreng (fried rice). Meat mains are good for sharing, but tend to be a little one note and similar. Cocktails are expensive, but killer. My favourite includes gin, cucumber, cilantro, and hot pepper.   After dinner we also went upstairs to Bar Batavia, a small bar owned by the same people. More great cocktails. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food was amazing. I tasted the wontons, chicken in peanut sauce, the wrapped shrimp, pork belly and rice. The service was great and quick. I had the chef table, which is when you look at the chefs making your food. Came here on a Saturday night, and it was pretty packed, you might need a reservation, but I didn't have with a group of 2.  Paid parking is not far on Yonge and there is street parking.  Definitely, recommend this place."}
{"text":"This small space has recently expanded to include an upstairs lounge. A great place to enjoy LS expertly crafted cocktails. Expect a cozy dinner, but the friendly staff and tasty bites more than make up for the slightly cramped space. The flavours of their Indonesian dishes make your mouth water. Love the croquettes. And love those Komodo Stingers."}
{"text":"I've got a soft spot for tapas-style places so keep that in mind.  I liked most of what we ordered here. Specifically, I thought the rendan taco (beef taco) was outstanding. The pangsit (wontons) and the beef croquettes were pretty decent too.  The satay ayam (chicken skewers) weren't bad but I probably wouldn't order it again. The nasi goreng was kind of too salty and it was just basically fried rice with not much else in it. It didn't seem worth it although maybe it's a bit better value than the $5 white rice. In general, I think the portions are a bit on the small side even for tapas so be prepared to order more than you expect you would need to.  The service was alright, and the inside is nice and hipsterish."}
{"text":"Cozy little neighbourhood resto. Great quality food. Small portions and slightly expensive. Unfortunately seating is tight and uncomfortable and very intimate. Would love to see management bring in some more comfortable seating arrangements but until then I won't be back."}
{"text":"First time here and everything was delicious! It was fairly empty when we arrived and were promptly seated by the friendly staff. I love Indonesian food and this place did not disappoint! We ordered the prawn crackers with peanut sauce and satay ayam to start. The peanut sauce was absolutely to die for! We had to wait a while for the rest of our order but the staff were so friendly, they ensured our waters were topped off and checked on us periodically. It was worth the wait. We ordered the grilled mustard greens, pork belly on pickled bean sprouts (Babi panggang) and the fried rice (nasi goreng). They were all winners and I would be happy to return here to try out more items."}
{"text":"The Semur Java, Babi Panggang, Watermelon salad, Cauliflower salad and Nasi Goreng were stand outs and enough of a reason to recommend this place to friends and family.  SO GOOD.  We also had the wontons and chicken taco, which were average at best. I will be back."}
{"text":"Really great food. Neat drinks. Tasty desert. Cool atmosphere and great service! Happy to have this new place in our neighbourhood.... i'll be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Perfect place in the Yonge Egg area for great drinks and food. The bartenders are amazing the food was delicious...  Absolute hidden gem"}
{"text":"More like 3.5 here because good service, cool vibes, pretty tasty food, but portions are so small. Perhaps we missed the memo that it's a tapas bar? Staff were helpful in providing suggestions as we had no idea what anything on the menu were having not really eaten Indonesian food much. I'm biased but I still think Thai food tastes better than Indonesian food based on what we ordered (fish, grilled pork, the vegetable fried rice, and Chili chicken). Yelp pics from others helped A LOT in my decision!"}
{"text":"This is a hip place with great ambiance! The portions were really small so order accordingly. The food was good in general but it was VERY spicy. The fish and watermelon salad are not worth getting"}
{"text":"Endless top reviews, write ups, a feature in EnRoute magazine...the hype engine was in full gear as I was fully revved up to go and try a meal at Little Sister. I may not be a gastronomic foodie on level infinity but I do know what I like and my taste buds tell me when some fusion foods work. Little sister does everything they can to be chic and trendy. The table we sat at was very uneven wood and it was \"rustic\" if you can call it. However, it was also extremely sticky - kind of hard to clean out all the grooves in the wood...I guess. They print their menus on corrugated paper with strips of yellow tape on it - one piece of cardboard makes for a simple menu. As the Globe and Mail said - order everything! We ordered items from all parts of the menu. Satay, Nasi Goreng, Watermelon Salad, Babi Guling, Rendang Taco, Shrimp Lettuce Wrap, Babi Kecap, Udang Kari, Babi Panggang...drinks...so yeah...almost everything! The only memorable part was my wife's tiny little drink for $13 - it was the Pisco. Some people rave about the watermelon. What they did to the watermelon to make it lose all it's refreshing characteristic is a process that I would not want to know. I understand what the chef was reaching for with all the flavours but it really was a little over the top. Too many flavours competing with eachother. The portions were so small, my younger son wanted to know if we can now go to a real restaurant and have a meal. The hype can sometimes set such an expectation that can not be met. This is one of them."}
{"text":"I had a great dinner at Little Sister.  Their chicken satay is great but not a huge portion.  My friend had the 5 spice braised pork which i tadted and would totally go back for.  The perfect balance of spices and super tender meat.  Its like one of the popular downtown joints tucked away on yonge street uptown.  You would never notice it but it is pipular so make reservations"}
