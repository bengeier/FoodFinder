{"text":"Greasy diner / fast-food joint with charm and low prices. I don't come here especially, but when we were renting a nearby gym to play Ultimate Frisbee in winter we used to hang out here after the game. You can get everything from hot-dogs, through burgers, and up to smoked meat sandwiches here. Their fries portions on combos are huge! The poutine is ok! No cards accepted, bring cash (and possibly leave with change from a $10 bill!). There are no immediate alternatives within a few minutes walking. They have parking outside, and comfy red diner seats inside."}
{"text":"La Belle Province style food but better quality, better portions and better taste. Excellent place for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Besoin d'un fix de junkfood au restau du coin? Vous êtes au bon endroit! Le menu manque peut être un peu de variété (ex: pas de cheeseburger, fromage chargé en extra) mais ils sont très très généreux sur la portion de frites avec votre repas et le personnel est toujours super agréable!"}
{"text":"I just love this place. Their steamy is just so good, I always get a huge portion of fries, and the staff is so friendly. The gyro and poutines are also pretty good."}
