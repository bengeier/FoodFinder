{"text":"Mikeys II is owned and operated by a local family.  Their food is authentic, and made to order.  I like their tacos, enchiladas, tamales, and the rice and beans are top notch.  Red chile hot sauce is warm, but not real hot, and very tasty.  Pair up your meal with a bottled mexican Coke, and you have something special!"}
{"text":"So bummed that this place closed down on April 28, but the family said that they will have a cart going at summer events in  Buckeye so be on the lookout. Great food and great family. Always made us feel welcomed."}
{"text":"Tried Mikey's II for the first time while driving through old town Buckeye. I got their Mikey's Burrito that had carne asada, avocado, potatoes, grilled onions, Jalepenos, tomatoes, sour cream and it was the best I've ever eaten... For real! Lol. Plus, I'm not a green chili salsa type of gal, but after trying their green chili salsa I can officially say that it will be my go to hot sauce when going there. It's sooo good! The red chili salsa was Delish too.   The staff is very polite and the prices are reasonable for the portion size... Our burritos were huge and it was about $5.75. I actually had to save some of it for later! I live in Goodyear, so I will definitely make the drive for my burrito fix.   One negative is that the place is very small. It was lunch when we went but we actually did have plenty of room to sit, however, not sure how the crowd is later in the day since its a small town. They do have a drive thru as well. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been to 4 different places in Buckeye where I can get mexican food, La Placita, Filliberto's, West West Steakhouse and Mikey's.  In my opinion, Mikey's has the best tasting mexican food out of all 4 and the prices are very reasonable for what you get. I would have given it at  least 4 stars if the portions were a little bit larger. When I have any of the combination plates, they leave me just a little bit hungry when I'm finished with it. Don't let that stop you, give it a try, I think you'll like it. It looks like they opened a second location on Monroe Street called Mikey's II."}
