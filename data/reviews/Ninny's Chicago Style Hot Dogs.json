{"text":"Great hot dogs and these were king size franks. As the proprietor is from Chicago she knows how to get them right, including the celery salt and small peppers. Was too full to try the beefs but they looked just as good. Limited seating inside. But taking them home was just as much fun, good onion rings. Being from Chicago I would rank them up there with Carm's in Chicago which is the Holy Grail for us Chicagoans stranded in the Buckeye wasteland."}
{"text":"This is the best place next to Chicago to get an authentic Chicago style all beef hotdog!  This is a great discovery for me as I am from Chicago and can say this truly is the real deal!  Thanks Ninny's for a small bite of home!"}
{"text":"Fantastic little spot. I got the Chicago Dog and Chili Dog. There was a little wait but well worth it for the quality and price of the food. I'll be heading back no doubt."}
{"text":"OK-- VERY GOOD CHICAGO DOGS here.... I prefer a little more celery salt on mine but overall these are very good and remind me of all I had as I grew up in the city..   Young lady greeted me as soon as I walked in and was very nice! She told me her Mom started the Restaurant after relocating and missing her city dog fix! GLAD SHE DID!   One thing needed is TAMALES which was a normal addition to a Chicago Dog when I grew up....   I will be back on my next trip to Hudson!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check this place out in the month since this place opened, but have just gotten around to it today. I was told by a friend that I needed to try the Italian Beef Sandwich, and that I could get it mild, or spicy. That advice did not disappoint! First, you enter the place, and you immediately feel at home. The owner teased me about getting a song stuck in her head and I immediately felt like I was among friends!   So I ordered the spicy beef sandwich, and the fries and checked the place out as I waited. Nice place, very Chicago style decor and a big picture of Bill Murray on the wall, so naturally it's a great place. She handed me my food and I was on my way.   Got home and unwrapped all the delicious goodness that lay before me. The sandwich was overflowing with sliced Italian beef and onions/peppers, and a healthy amount of Au Jus just tying everything together. She warned me that the sandwich was supposed to be a \"wet sandwich\" and I was fine with that, nothing wrong with a little au jus! Grabbed a napkin (or five) and went to town. Unbelievable! Sandwich was spicy, but not so spicy that you couldn't taste the beef which was amazing. The fries were thick cut and delicious. Was extremely impressed with this little place.   As she prepared my food, I commented that this was my first time in there, and she said \"Oh, you'll be back\" and she was right, I will. Time and time again. There's still 8 other things on the menu that I must try after all.   Ninny's accepts all major credit cards, has Belly, and is a TWC Wi-Fi hotspot.....so go there....go ahead....I'll wait..........."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant! Went for my first time and got a chili dog and a Polish sausage. Should've got one or the other, the Polish sausage is huge or as Kathleen said ginormous! Kathleen is a hoot, she doesn't pull any punches (which I love) tells it like it is. I can't wait to go back for the other menu items (One at a time of course). Go there, you won't be disappointed!!!!!"}
{"text":"Here is the place to go for a true Chicago style dog without the 5 hour drive. Amazing chili dogs and Polish Sausages. I can't wait to try their other items.  You Definitely will not be disappointed. Do not let the small restaurant fool you.  She can compete with the best."}
{"text":"So far, have tried the Polish sausage, the Italian sausage, the Italian beef (spicy), and my wife gets the Chicago style.  All good.  Will be trying the fried egg and the baloney s'wiches, expect they'll be good also. Friendly kind of place, gets kinda cozy with more than 4-5 customers.  Come summer, can see myself walking over (it's close to home), then hitting Stricklands for dessert."}
{"text":"Speaking as a Chicago native, I was skeptical about their claim of real Chicago hot dogs.  The hot dogs were not Vienna (they were actually bigger here!), the relish wasn't neon green (but you can't taste color), the poppy seeds seemed to be attached to the buns before serving (no biggie).  That being said, the flavor and feel were spot on.  The hot dog was delicious.  Someone mentioned the dogs seems to be cooked in steam or water.  They are supposed to be - Chicago dogs are not grilled (which Retro Dog doesn't understand).  I'll be back, looking forward to the Italian Beef!"}
{"text":"So, first of all I love a good hot dog. I was very excited to see this place not too far from home. Tried it tonight and was disappointed. The 1/4 dog was good, could have been hotter. The chili was passable. Fries were the coated kind, like the ones popular in the 90's. Either fresh cut or crinkle is the way to go. I ordered the onion rings for $3.50, got 5 rings. All small and cooked in too hot oil, so they were too crispy. Also the young lady forgot to drop them and I didn't get them until done with the dog. Interior seating was .two very small tables, so not much decor. Overall I was disappointed in the place."}
{"text":"I'm writing this for my daughter. Her and I owned our cafe/bakery....so she has culinary experience and a good palette.  She went and got a chili dog and fries. Her friend got a hot dog and pickle chips.   She said the dogs weren't very  memorable unfortunately.  My daughter said they do grill them on the flat top, which is the only way to go in my opinion.   I do have a couple of questions from one cook to another:  Are we using quality buns that are fresh?? She also said the fries weren't very tasty.  The grease tasted very old. This was about 2 weeks ago... so I would recommend setting a schedule to change out the oil. I know that can get away from us in all the responsibilities of running a place.  Pickle chips looked frozen to me (bad call)...and her friend wouldn't eat them.  Are the fries fresh??   I'm going to come down and try myself one day.   But if we aren't making everytg from scratch--chili sauce,  Pickle  chips....whatver. Go back to the drawing board and rethink some things.  One other yelper stated the relish/pepper mixture..... for the beef sandwich was taken out of a jar? May I make some suggestions.... if we are going to go that route--- either--- put it in another container so the ppl don't know, or tweak it a bit by chopping it up a bit and possibly adding your own twist on things. I wouldn't just grab a jar and let customers see that. You can allredy see what kind of impression it made on him. With an open kitchen it's probably harder to keep the cooks secrets under wraps...  But there are ways to do things better.   There's a thousand and 1 places that serve frozen food from a bag, or stuff from a can.  Set yourself apart.   I hope I'm not sounding condescending here..I really would love to help local small businesses with their food and business plans. I was approached by 2 businesses to do that very thing, but never had the time to follow through with it. But I'm only saying these things in hopes you will take it constructively.   With my business, my financial backer just flaked on us, and I couldn't carry the overhead myself- but my food was good and I had repeat customers in only a few short weeks.   You've got an opportunity of a lifetime here lady......do it right!!!!  I wish u the very best and hope you make it. :))"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my wife.  We each got an Italian Beef Sandwich and fries.  Me being the beast I am got a Chicago Style Hot Dog as well.  The beef sandwiches are a wet sandwich with lots of  juice.  The meat is shaved very thin and was tender.  The sandwiches were tasty.  The hot dog was authentic and pretty darn good.  I will definitely try the chili dog next trip.  The fries are the string variety like the ones they serve at Skyline Chili.  They were pretty good as well.  The only thing is the seating.  There are literally two tables so maybe have a backup plan in case they are both taken.  Overall it was tasty and we'll be back.  The owner was friendly and the experience was positive!"}
{"text":"Visited with family first time on a saturday. Very small place two tables w 4 chairs each inside. Tables outside. Would say more of a carryout. Heard they had chicago style hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches. Well since im from chicago would rate myself an expert. Love CLE love OHIO. But when it comes to food hot dogs pizza and ital beef well CLE  lets say doesnt have. Of course its all subjective! So dont crucify me!LOL Anyway family had chicago style hotdogs? Ok somewhat...i could critique but they liked them. Hot dog itself was huge and thats the first big difference btw a real chicago style ....but who cares! It was a lot of dog and they loved it. I crave for chicago style italian beef sandwiches! I watch you tube just to look at someone eating them! Cause thats abt as close as u get if u r not in chitown! What i would say is that the beef was very good...the bun not chgo style it has to be a crusty bread! Apparently just cant get outside chgo? No sweet peppers!?  Cardinal sin...they take time to do properly and make a chgo style beef! Had gardinera  ok overall id say it wasnt a bad italian beef actually despite not being true chgo style i would recommend cause unless u drive 6 hrs to chgo u r not gonna find! One more comment the young lady working was working solo and she had a rush of customers and did one hell of a job! Friendly great service and prepared all the food alone so high five to her! Owners if reading this give her a raise! So bottom line highly recommend! Good food reasonable prices excellent service"}
{"text":"This place is excellent and inexpensive. Great Chicago dog and fried pickles! Definitely stop by, I'll be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great Place to grab a DOG!  Stop in and say HI to the owner..... She's super friendly!!"}
{"text":"My and girlfriend and I were anxiously awaiting for the opening of this place and we were not disappointed. The menu may be smaller but anything on there is done right and easy on the wallet. They give you jumbo hotdogs unlike certain retro style places and they do not skimp on toppings. If you want to eat at that good local joint, come here!"}
{"text":"Ninny's Chicago dog was outrageously good! We also tried the chili dog and an Italian sausage with fries. We weren't find of the chili which is why I can't give 5 stars but the sausage and Chicago dog were both out of sight. It's a one man (WOMAN) show and Kathleen was pushing the food out and has made a believer out of us. I will make this a regular stop when I'm in town. Thanks for the great meal!"}
{"text":"Very good Italian sausage sandwich. Great prices.. Good little place to grab a sandwich.."}
{"text":"By now I'm pretty sure we've tried everything on the menu at least once. The food is awesome and well priced. Out of the other hot dog places in the area, this is always our number one pick!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place out for a couple months. My dog of choice is going to be a Chicago dog whenever one is available, they have them here. The food was great and the price was right. My only complaint is that I did not try this place sooner. I rarely eat out at lunch, but I am definitely coming here many more times in the future. You want a good Chicago dog this is the place to get it."}
{"text":"Great service but not a bunch of seating and it was the closest thing to a Chicago dog that I've had outside of Chicago! People behind the counter were super nice!"}
{"text":"So... I've been to this place 3 times, first time was good, Chicago style dog is good.  I also bought a pastrami sandwich, it was a specialty sandwich.  Found a hair, so gross!  I then contacted them said I would come back, give them a second chance.  Owner i friendly and nice and was appalled I found a hair, now this is a hot dog stand but still.  It's kinda dirty looking not the cleanest place, but it's hot dogs, I think the concept is khool, but they need some sanitary help.  So I went back, a second time just got the Chicago style dog! It was good and the owner was all apologetic, thanks for giving us a second chance what have you.  So I just went on Friday February 10, hot the Chicago style, and I venture off again got the speciality style sandwich, 8hrs later I was so sick to my stomach and 24 hrs later I was like never again.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this because I don't know, it's because it was the food, it's a small spot but stuff is on the floor in the corner, then on the other side tey have a fish tank that's clean, it's like they are there but it's a mother daughter venture, an the worker is always doing something on the lap top, so I think there is a lot of cross contamination, but I digress.  If you take anything from this just get a Chicago style hot dog, pay, leave,  eat in your car, or take it home."}
{"text":"Second time here.  Love this place.  Hot dogs are the bomb, but I love the Fried Egg sandwich.  Friendly staff that remembers you.  Great neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"The hot dog was big in a sesame bun and tasted just okay. The chili seemed to be Hormel to me out of a can and the onions were chopped too big. If you're coming to this place don't come for a hot dog"}
{"text":"Move over Retro Dog, there's a new hot dog joint in town!  Ninny's is a small, chef-owned restaurant situated right next to Stricklands Frozen Custard, just across the street from Acme.  Upon walking in I was greeted by Kathleen, the owner, who was hard at work on a meal for the customer in front of me. She was doing all of the work; taking orders, making food and answering questions!  There were only 9 items on the menu but it was still a hard choice. After some suggestions from Kathleen I decided to go with a Ninny's Chicago Style Hot Dog and a Chili Dog.   A couple minutes later she handed me a couple giant foil-wrapped dogs and I was on my way. On my short drive home the aroma of the hot dogs filled my car and made it hard to resist not opening them during rush-hour traffic on Rt 8!  I snapped a picture of them once I got home and dove right in. I started with the Chili Dog. It had an abundance of melted cheese, and excellent chili sauce and plenty of onions. I was actually pretty surprised with how large the actual hot dog was as well! This is not your average back-yard-grill-pack-of-8 hot dog from the grocery store! They were freshly steamed (or boiled, not sure) 1/4 pound dogs!   Once I finished I moved on to the Chicago dog which was even more fantastic! It has very crisp and fresh tomatoes, a pickle spear, onions and a couple sport peppers; for a second, after that first bite, I mistakenly thought I was standing in downtown Chicago! None of the flavors were overpowering and everything seemed to meld together perfectly.  Overall it was a very enjoyable experience. The no-frills location focuses on the authentic recipes that Kathleen has perfected over the years. I will definitely return and look forward to trying the Italian Beef or Sausages next time!"}
{"text":"Went back again. This time the owner was there with one other person. One person ahead of me and both of us out the door at the exact same time. Food still good. Only recommendation get a more up to date register system. They are using a old school system in which you type in the cost of each item, each time it is purchased. Makes for a slower process. The person in front ordered multiple numbers of multiple items. It caused some confusion at first. But I imagine should it continue to do well that will all be in good time."}
{"text":"Great food, great prices...just dont count on eating there!!! lol"}
{"text":"Best Chicago dog I've ever had!!! Got home after eating it and went straight back for a second one!!!"}
{"text":"Great dogs, owner and family are from Chicago. I grew up in Chicagoland, and this is as close to home as it gets. Ditka would approve."}
{"text":"The family and I just went after a nice walk in the Valley. Awesome hot dogs. Love the Chicago style. Service was great and they brought the food to us outside at the picnic table. We will go back for sure! Prices are very fair too!"}
{"text":"I saw this place pop up on Yelp and had to try it, being a native Chicagoan. I was hoping for something close to the native experience.  So: Just a few tables. OK, fine; a lot of places in Chicago are mostly take-out. Some of the reviews I've seen rave about the decor. Say what? A few attempts at \"Chicago\" art; nothing that really felt authentic.  Behind the counter, I see that there's only one person working. While I'm waiting in line (behind one other person who took forever), I hear that they're out of the Chicago dogs. Which is somewhat confusing, given the name of the place. But, OK, I'll go with a beef and fries (no hot tamales on the menu, alas).  So ... wait, wait, wait. Finally she gets around to making my beef. Big warning sign: The beef's not sitting in the juice. Instead, she fishes some cold beef out of a bag and tosses it into the juice to warm up. This is Not Good.   I asked for it wet, which should mean either dipping the whole roll into the juice or at least ladling it over until the roll is soaking. Instead, I get a tiny ladle that barely wets the inside of the roll.   Do I want giardiniera? Absolutely! I ... uh-oh. Down comes a 5- or 10-gallon tub of garishly colored large chunks of vegetable-like substances. This is not giardiniera. It should be chopped smaller, less neon.  I'm finally served and the result is as bad as I feared. The beef is dry, tough, sliced too thick. The \"giardiniera\" tastes off. The fries are hot but not well prepared.  I really want to encourage people who attempt to do authentic Chicago-style food, but this place gives Chicago a bad name."}
{"text":"My family had ate here a few times. First couple of times the owner was friendly & the hot dogs were great. Saturday early evening we stopped for hot dog but were very disappointed. The girl messed our order up & noticed the people after us while we were eating took a hot dog back wasn't what they ordered. The hot dogs didn't taste like we had before. I think the owner grilled them. These taste like they came out of warm water. Not hot & no taste."}
