{"text":"Stopped in Irwin on long trip back home, happened upon this place.  Really solid food (great kids pizza) and wonderful atmosphere and service.  Very friendly server.  Really enjoyed the steak tenderloin sandwich and blackened chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Arrived between lunch and dinner so the service was very good.  Had the wood fired pretzels for the appetizer and a blackened chicken and Atlantic Cod sandwiches.  The pretzels were good but probably would try something else.  The fish was also good and would get it again.  The blackened chicken sandwich was excellent and I recommend trying it if you like spicy.  Will eat here again."}
{"text":"Great food, excellent staff, reasonable prices! I've dined here over a dozen times and they never fail to impress me. Kevin, the front of the house manager, is the best of the best."}
{"text":"There's some good and bad about this place.  I have been there twice.  The bad: Parking is on the opposite side of the entrance. Being seated takes 5 minutes even when all the tables are empty. Food is mediocre. Portions are small. Prices lean to the high side. Menu is limited.  The good: Nice decor. Extremely clean. Large staff. Great craft beer selection. Friendly waitresses.  I will give them more time to work things out and try again in the future.  When Doublewide Grill opened near the same time I didn't think the area could support two similar restaurants.  If you look at the number of customers at each place DWG is very busy and TFP is empty.  I hope they work it out.  Edit 12/29: The owners should have scheduled a road trip to Texas to see what brisket is supposed to taste like."}
{"text":"Food was good. Experience was awful. The entertainment is too loud to have a conversation with anyone you're with. They need to put the entertainment on the patio."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining for lunch at the Firepit and was glad I finally tried it! I had the kale salad and my husband had the fish sandwich, both of which were very good! I loved the atmosphere and our service was excellent. Price was moderate, I felt in line for that type of restaurant. So happy to see a restaurant in the Irwin area with menu selections that are current with how people like to eat nowadays!"}
{"text":"Visited for the first time for dinner. The atmosphere was inviting and the staff was friendly. I ordered the charred fruit sangria and also the summer sangria. Both missed the sangria taste, but on a positive note there was a good selection of craft beer. The food was amazing. We had dry rub wings, a Carolina brisket sandwich, Margherita Flatbread, and a baby wedge salad. If you're looking for a unique restaurant, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"I don't think I would come back here.  Food wasn't anything to get excited about the wings were frozen and didn't ha e any smoke flavor which they were supposedly they were.   Service was ok as well nothing great there.  The nachos were not good supposed to have pull pork on the maybe had two spoons (pulled pork tasted great) so there wasn't any that had lettuce in them which was weird and certainly not worth 9.00."}
{"text":"The service was quick, the food was delicious! Best place in north huntingdon! Our bartender was on point the entire time. The owner was checking in on customers, which really tells alot about the place. I recommend!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful lunch today here.  Service was great as well as the food!  The flatbreads were good and so were the other appetizers we had.  Burgers are very good as well as the brisket!  We will be going back very soon!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to go. The service is always great. The food is really good. I love the Caesar salad and all their grilled dishes. Everything I have had is wonderful. I will continue to recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"My husband and I really wanted to love the FirePit. We waited anxiously for it to open and then waited a month for them to work out the kinks before trying it. When we arrived we were told it would be a 10 min wait for a table (at 5pm on a Saturday, not bad!). We had a drink at the lovely bar and were seated in 10 min. We then waited for 15 min before anyone came to our table and only bc we approached a manager. We had the chips, guac and salsa appetizer- won't get it again- guac was bland and salsa was not anything special. My husband had a burger that was dry and I had the shrimp tacos, which were ok. The highlight of our meals was the delicious fries and the extensive beer list.   Overall, our dining experience was not great. We may go back for the bar atmosphere but considering the service was terrible and the food lackluster... It'll be a while."}
{"text":"I have been to The Fire Pit multiple times since it has opened and have always had a great experience!  I am so happy to have such a premiere restaurant so close to home!  It is wonderful to experience freshly made delicious food that is not processed like the chain restaurants.  The atmosphere there is perfect!  The servers and bartenders are top notch, so friendly and attentive.  I have tried many items and loved everything!  Prices are lower than what I have experienced for the same quality of another restaurant with such large portions.  Definitely a place to take your friends and family too!"}
{"text":"The restaurant decor and atmosphere were nice. A little dark but I like that. We sat at a high top table by the bar, got a little noisy but not terrible. I had the special which was fried chicken, smashed potatoes and cole slaw. Chicken was seasoned really well, potatoes were just average. Cole slaw tasted homemade, was very creamy. Portions were huge, I got 2 meals out of it. I would definitely go back to try something else. A little on the pricey side, I think my meal was around $20 but again, I got 2 meals out of it so it was worth it."}
{"text":"Our family came to dinner here and the food was good.  The Caesar salad was delicious and the kids loved the wings.  The pretzel appetizer was yummy!  We had good service and didn't wait long for our food.  Love having more restaurant choices in Irwin!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night to try this place out. Like others have said, it's a nice change of pace from the fast food/fast-casual food that is mostly in the area. They had live music and people started to sing along which I thought was very fun. The atmosphere is great and there is a nice patio out front as well. As for the food, I tried the blackened chicken sandwich- cooked well and the chicken was still juicy, but the fries weren't the best- a little soggy for my liking. But overall had a great experience and would definitely want to come back and try some other options."}
{"text":"Came here on Black Friday for dinner and beers.   Was expecting a long wait but we were seated in the bar area right away.  Our service was really good, as our server took it on herself to split the meals for my wife and I after we told her we were going to share.   That was something I'd not experienced before without asking for it and it made a very good impression.  We had the grilled pretzels for an appetizer and they were awesome as were the stone ground mustard and the chorizo sauce for dipping.  We split a wedge salad, which was also very good and the Cuban sandwich.  The fries were excellent and the sandwich was pretty good though it was not a traditional Cuban sandwich with the pulled pork and ham.  They used sliced pork loin instead which made the sandwich a little dry but again, still tasty.  All in all we liked this place very much for a date night spot and we will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I have visited for drinks, dined in, dined on the patio, and ordered take out.    WHEN DINING AT THE RESTAURANT:  We have always been seated promptly and had great service.  The restaurant is clean, and plates/glasses are always cleared without asking.   Our favorite menu items include the Pit Burger and the So Cal Tacos.  The beef, chicken, and vegetables are a better quality than most area restaurants use.  Our most recent visit was on St. Patrick's Day - our table was reserved as requested and the place was PACKED, but our food and service never suffered.  The bartenders are always on point when mixing the drinks.  WHEN ORDERING TAKE OUT:  It used to be our go-to for take out about once a week, but not anymore.  The way that Firepit packages the food items is great (i.e. sauces on the side that are in containers with lids, letting the meat rest before placing it on the bun, etc.).  However, there has been a complete lack of quality control, so we've received the correct order but it doesn't match the description on the menu or what we've been served in the dining room.    This is a solid choice to visit for lunch/dinner, especially when the patio is open and there's a live band."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Very pricey for a local irwin restaurant & bar. Interesting menu, but nothing that really caught my attention. Wish they had a little more typical bar food & slightly lower alcohol prices."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in there for lunch on a Saturday a couple of weeks ago.  She ordered a salad and I ordered a steak.  The steak ended up being very thin and over done.  Very disappointing.  Service was good.  Atmosphere not so great; we couldn't hear each other talk due to the sound being turned up very loud on a football game no one was paying attention to.    Hard to say how this place will do; I don't think it's the right formula for the area.   I won't be back."}
{"text":"Poor service and over salted food. I was super excited when I saw this place going in. They make themselves out to be a hip place to eat. Yet I couldn't help notice that the staff was purposefully keeping tables empty and making customers wait 20 min for a table when there are several clean tables open.  Tried them twice, third strike and I will be done."}
{"text":"Last night we had a group of 20 with a reservation. They had us at two separate tables out on the patio- fine. But we also had two separate servers. The two tables got their food about 40 mins in between of each other. When we approached the manager /owner, he said the power went out in between orders and the kitchen did not get order. Not sure if that was true- but Ok- customer service would tell you to tell your patrons that there was a problem. No discount offered- just a few draft beers on the house. If you like to get your food in a timely manner/ and like good customer service- go somewhere else. Plus- we were celebrating a special day Bummer-"}
{"text":"Food good when u can get something. 3 times drove out of the way for one reason love there Moscow mule.. But for ridiculous reason kitchen closed . got there at 9 05 .. 2 time bad weather . 3 time not sure"}
{"text":"The owners were very nice to the family and we enjoyed. The food was excellent.we have gone back again with are friends. They had a good time. We will go back again."}
{"text":"We just had a late dinner at the new Fire Pit Restaurant  in Irwin and it was outstanding.  The service was excellent and every item arrive piping hot and delicious. We started with 2 craft beers on tap, then tried the pretzel appetizer with whole grain mustard on the side.  The burger was made from freshly ground steak and was perfectly grilled.  The salmon BLT with Applewood bacon was perfectly seared.  The fries were well seasoned and crisp.  The staff were all very friendly and attentive.  The meal was fairly priced.  Overall, an excellent choice and we will certainly return."}
{"text":"Stopped for dinner as was driving home. Great food, service was good and very fast. Would recommend it! I had the kale salad with grilled Salmon and my husband had the Caribbean grilled chicken. Both were excellent!"}
{"text":"Excellent lunch. This was the second time we were there and the food an service were great again. Lunch was a perfect portion. 1/2 sandwich and chicken chili. Cold beer warm soup."}
{"text":"Seated right away for indoor seating although the outdoor seating area looked very nice. The brisket sandwich was enjoyable and the coleslaw pairing maid it even better (very fresh). No up charge for substituting the fries. Nice to know I don't need to drive into Greensburg for a good meal. And the 20+ beers on tap were a plus. Service was prompt and friendly. I'll come back again when traveling here."}
{"text":"I was in town for the holidays and here to meet a friend. The atmosphere is fine and busting for a Friday evening. I was promptly seated and got my ice tea while waiting on my friend that was running a few minutes late. I was then asked to change tables as a reservation they had would do better at my table. That was fine with me and got moved back towards the corner. They then pushed several tables together with the person at the end of that table essentially seated at our table. Kind of cramped and akward.  My dish was ok. I got the pork chop entree. The pork chop was good, the sides, quite lacking. The cauliflower tasted like it was prepped a few hours earlier and a little dried out. The cornbread was crispy and dry. My friend's burger and fries looked much more appetizing and he seemed to enjoy them. The service was decent despite our server having that large group next to us."}
{"text":"I try to be fair in my reviews but I must say we were disappointed.  The restaurant was nice on the inside and the place was clean.  They had a nice selection of craft beers on tap and a few of them were on special. It took a while to get seated but we asked a waitress if we could sit at a table in the bar area.  Our waitress was attentive and got us our drinks quickly. When our salads arrived they had the dressing on the salad even though we asked for it on the side. Not a problem since the grilled Caesar salads needed the amount of dressing they put on it. Things went down hill because we waited a long time for our entrees and the food was ho him at best when it arrived. I ordered a margarita flatbread that was done on top but the flatbread was it self not baked on the bottom. My wife got a vegetable salad with grilled chicken and \"roasted\"vegetables. The chicken had no grill marks or grilled flavor. In fact it resembled something that was sautéed in a wok. There were no roasted veggies only a bed of fresh spinach. I sent my flatbread back and helped my wife eat her chicken and spinach salad."}
{"text":"Great place to eat in Irwin PA! The wedge salad is fantastic, portion sizes are nice and big. Come hungry because you will want to eat!"}
{"text":"Good food. Friendly wait staff and owners. Seems like most folks know each other. Always crowded. Diverse menu. Love the appetizers."}
{"text":"Went for lunch & food was ok. Wasn't busy & didn't have the greatest service. I got soft tacos and they were soggy by the time they were brought to the table. My fiancé got the crab cake sandwich & it was a hit...he loved it! Will go back in summer to check out the outdoor seating section."}
{"text":"When I go to a place that says wood fire I think Pizza.. Nope, Nadda not today at this establishment. They have a margherita pizza and another type of pizza as an appetizer but that's it.  They have burgers, ribs, some pasta dishes, fish and what I ordered. It was a tenderloin hoagie with too many onions. The munch wannabe ordered a pulled pork sammy and the growing *angel* ordered ribs.  The food was 7 out of 10 probably and the service was 6-7 out of 10. There were many TVs at the bar area to watch the Pens game and it looked like a nice array of beers on tap.  We didn't order dessert tonight."}
{"text":"Dry rubbed ribs were good. Sirloin steak a beautiful little cut of meat. Chips and salsa tasty and generously sized. Wait staff very friendly. Not quite 5 stars, but good value except that the beer was flat."}
{"text":"There smoked wings were very good!! The brisket sandwich was also delicious! Good waitress's.  We will go back!!  Chilly near the windows being that the AC never quit running."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch, sat right down.  The wife and I ordered, and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time.  Ordered a couple of sandwiches, a cuban and  a brisket  not very good!  The bread was hard and the meat over cooked.  We will give it a second chance soon, I hope it's  better."}
{"text":"We stopped here for drinks on St. Patty's weekend. We had a great time; more of an older crowd filled the bar area and a live Irish band played many classics. Families were finishing up their early dinners and I'd say we trickled in at the perfect time to miss the crowd.   Eventually, we ordered chicken strips, bean and corn dip, and the pub pretzels, which were all pretty decent. Then corn and bean dip was probably my favorite- it came with a generous portion of both pita and tortilla chips for dipping.   Our waitress was attentive and helpful; she never let our glasses get empty. We arrived around 5:30 and the hostesses did a wonderful job helping us to find seats at the bar, as the rest of the tables were taken with reservations. I hope to come back next time and enjoy the patio."}
{"text":"{update} {good}the flatbread pizzas are excellent, the Rueben is really good,  the patio is nice in the summer, there are bands on the weekends,  {bad} \"chargrilled\" shrimp, is a misnomer- they are steamed and then rubbed with old bay? served cold. I expected actual chargrilled shrimp with some flavor for 4 for $9 and the deconstructed smore is an abomination the brownie is dry, the sugar crispy is burned and the marshmallow is just meh.   *Update* we have been back a few time since my original review   {original}The wait was about 30 mins on a Friday, not too bad. However the food was very disappointing. I got the salmon $21.50, it was quiet possibly the smallest piece of salmon I have ever seen. I get bigger ones from giant eagle for $8!  I was finished with it before my husband finished half of his burger.  {that NEVER happens} His burger had balsamic greens, mushrooms and fluffed goat cheese... That thing should have been packed with flavor, sadly it had none.  There was an optional free bread and oil basket- it was \"warm\" read soggy pita and some kind of unleavened cracker type thing...  The green oil was nondescript. It's like the chef has no palate... Nothing has flavor. I don't understand.  I wanted to like it, it has a very inviting outside seating area, the dining room has a nice look.  The waitstaff is very nice and were there when you needed them and not hovering. Maybe we will try again in a few months to see if they have gotten their stride."}
{"text":"Ive been to the Firepit a good handful of times and I want to like it more but I just don't. I will say the pulled pork nachos are amazing. I've come to the point I would be happy if I just get those every time I go.  I got the buffalo chick wrap the other day.  I didn't think I could not like a wrap but it honestly just wasn't good. I have also had a burger and tenderloin sandwich and those were also Okay.  So all in all they Firepit is not top of my list for the area but it is convenient bc it is close so I will return. But just might only eat off the appetizers area."}
{"text":"A nice newer place in Irwin. They have a decent menu with some things on it that are a bit out of the ordinary for Irwin but much much welcome. For example, I had a Cuban sandwich for lunch! Where else in Irwin could you get that? I had it with a Cesar salad which was also good. You have the option of having the salad chopped or grilled! (yes they grill the actual salad) I did not have mine grilled but I heard that it is very tasty.  They have a big outside area to sit in if the weather is nice, the only bad part about it is the only thing you have to look at is the massive shopping center parking lot and the highway beyond that.  Overall opinion, something new and different in a place that has a lot of the same and it is much welcome."}
{"text":"First time visit. A coupon in the local paper brought us in. We were the first to arrive on a Sunday afternoon.  The design of the restaurant was very eye appealing and I liked the atmosphere as well as being able to see the kitchen threw a huge glass window. I like the choice of sitting inside or dining outside on the patio.    The service was excellent. The flat bread Pizza was amazing, I really enjoyed it. The food was ordered promptly and delivered as well.  Okay... the only nice things I can say. The price with the coupon was reasonable BUT...   I thought the burger was mediocre at best. It was handmade and you can tell is was a frozen patty, how disappointing. I didn't care for it at all. It may have been delivered quickly, but it wasn't a hot burger at all. I didn't care of the fries either.  The Firepit won't be on any restaurant rotation list for this family. We saw no Manager during our visit. I can say the bathrooms are a clean and well managed restroom, however we were the first ones there that day."}
{"text":"Brisket sandwich not bad but ask for extra napkins it was quite messy and if you like the taste of bbq ask for extra sauce  on the side...burger a little over cooked...nice restaurant  was very clean both in the bar as well as restaurant areas...no need to wear a sweater here though, the fire pit is a good name...if you are a middle aged woman wear short sleeves, it was a bit toasty."}
{"text":"We stopped here because we wanted something other than turnpike food and we weren't disappointed! I had the wood fired Caribbean jerk chicken and my husband had the buffalo chicken wrap. Both were excellent! The jerk seasoning on the chicken wasn't too salty as they sometimes can be at other places. My kids ordered off the kids menu (pretty standard) and I have to say their fruit cup side was super fresh. It was hands down the best fruit cup they've ever had. My only suggestion would be to put mac n cheese or pasta on the kids menu. Overall I would go back!"}
{"text":"Visited here for the first time today. Looked like an awesome, hip place to visit. I was pretty impressed. I ordered the Signature Western Q Burger, and it was pretty delicious. My friend had the buffalo chicken wrap. It was a rather mild buffalo sauce, but he enjoyed it.  Overall, I enjoyed the casual environment. It seems like it'd be an awesome place to visit in the summer."}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Tuesday and it was actually pretty busy.  The server was very busy but did a great job multitasking at the bar along with several tables around the bar area.  The burger was cooked perfectly and very good.  The fries were hot and seasoned nicely.  A great experience!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place smelled like a dirty mop. The food was ok but I couldn't get over the smell when we came in. There was a fire pit outside which would probably be cool but when it is nice outside."}
{"text":"The Irwin area is finally picking up the pace with all of the new restaurants opening up.  I like seeing these new ventures and added excitement.  My friend and I decided to meet here for a light dinner.  When I arrived the place was fairly packed.  The hostess asked if I wanted a high table or a low table.  Apparently, the right answer was to opt for the high table because I was seated right away.  The couple waiting ahead of me asked the hostess if she forgot about them and she replied that I chose a high table and they chose a low table and one was not available yet. The happy hour drink and food menu is featured between 5-7.  We arrived a few minutes before 7 so we were able to take advantage of a drink special and we tried the grilled pretzels which was served with a great tasting mustard sauce. I must admit I didn't study the menu that well because I quickly decided to try the beef brisket sandwich.  I did notice they have burgers, wraps, salads and a few high end entrees etc. The brisket sandwich was ordinary but not in a bad way. I think I was expecting a little more flavor and the wow factor to kick in.  My friend chose the chicken quesadilla's from the happy hour menu and the portion size was enough for a meal. I like the atmosphere and design of this place.  It was a bit noisy but I suppose noisy is the in thing these days.  They have a great outdoor patio area complete with a lit fire pit and they have a stash of blankets on hand in case you feel a little chilled.  I plan to make a return visit to try out the menu again.  I hope this isn't one of those places that cant find it's niche and keeps making changes to get there."}
{"text":"We visited this restaurant on a Sunday. We were seated as soon as we arrived. The hostess was very friendly and asked which area in the restaurant we preferred.  The menu is decent sized. Plenty of selections without being overwhelming.  I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with cheddar cheese and it came with a side of fries. The chicken was tender and flavorful, served on a soft bun with lettuce tomato and onion. The fries were small broken pieces of the frozen variety. They were hot but had very little flavor. A pickle spear was also on the plate.  The other 2 people in my party ordered the soft tacos. One ordered pork tacos and the other chicken. The pork tacos came with a side salad for an extra 2 dollars. The salad was colorful with fresh vegetables and a decent amount of dressing.  Our waitress was just okay. She provided drink refills in a timely manner but otherwise she didn't do much for us.  The chicken sandwich was good but overall a very average restaurant. I doubt I will return."}
{"text":"At 6:00 on a Wednesday, the eatery was pretty empty and we were seated promptly, choosing a high top on a very comfortable patio. The ambiance was great, with a plethora of tables, an outdoor sofa and even a fire pit to sit around. As our dinner wound down, a duo arrived to set up for live music, which must be a big deal as a crowd began to form. But, back to the food...  We decided to dine light with my wife ordering a buffalo chicken wrap and myself getting pulled pork tacos, both with fries. The tacos arrived so full of meat they could barely be folded. I was very impressed! The pork was tender and sweet. By the time I finished my third taco, I was stuffed. Our waitress was prompt and courteous the entire time. This is a solid choice for dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"I went back and it was just as good as the last time!  This time around, I am on a 'diet' so I was so happy to see that there were a variety of menu options for me I choose from.  We started off with the caramelized onion dip, which comes with cucumbers and pita for dipping. It was quite good, though I didn't expect it to be so sweet! It was a sweet and creamy dip that tasted very fresh!  My boyfriend got the buffalo chicken salad, and it already came with grilled chicken, not the usual fried chicken. He enjoyed it VERY much; it was fresh and he liked the ranch dressing a lot.  I got a grilled chicken sandwich and asked for it without the fries. I also got a side house salad with ranch dressing. they ended up putting fries on my plate anyway which was a little unfortunate because I didn't want the temptation; but I ended up giving them to my nephew to eat and he nibbled on some.   I also stopped by the bathroom to freshen up- they are spotless, smell and look clean, and are stocked with the essentials. They also have such cute decor that matches the season or the holiday which is a really nice touch.  I always enjoy coming here for lunch or dinner and I continue to be a very satisfied patron when all is said and done!"}
{"text":"This is my second home... Excellent, always rotating tap selection, amazing chef who sources locally yet has culinary experience throughout the country, owners who are always friendly and almost always on-site, a manager who coordinates ever-changing events including monthly wine and beer dinners, and an outdoor patio that is centered around - you guessed it - a firepit. The only reason that this place gets anything less than rave reviews is because many people are used to the standard, generic, chain-style food that is served the instant you order it. Good food takes time folks - if you can't deal with that, go to a quick-fix restaurant for frozen, greasy, preservative- and sodium-filled meals. If you want a real culinary experience at reasonable prices, go to The Firepit...although I kind of hate to give away western Pennsylvania's best-kept restaurant secret."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. I came here for the first time when my good friend was playing Beatles music at the bar. They offer great local artists opportunities to play at their bar. The music and atmosphere is great. My only complaint, like many others on here, is that it is very loud in here when they have live music. It is not a place for you to come chat with your friends, but it's more of a listening kind of night. That night we ordered multiple appetizers, and each had good proportions and the price was reasonable. We did not buy any specialty drinks that night. I would love to come here on a summer or fall night and sit out on there beautiful patio. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We have wanted to try this place for some time but never had the time. We didn't miss much. The atmosphere was the best thing about the place. I ordered a rack of ribs and the wife ordered a salmon sandwich. They have a glass window that runs the length of the dining room that looks into the kitchen. We saw our food come up, then sit, and sit. The wife's sandwich was put up about 5 minutes before mine, then they sat for about another ten minutes. So of course when they came out the bottom of her sandwich was soggy and the sauce on my ribs had completely dried up. Her sandwich was a little over done and soggy, but it wasn't the worst she had ever had. Bland, but ok. The ribs were over cooked and dry. Besides the sauce on the top they had absolutely zero flavor. None. For a place to have a name that implies good BBQ, this is horrible. The ribs were a good size, but horrible. The worst ribs I have ever had, hands down. Like they take them from the packing, throw on the grill with some seasoning, then drizzle some sauce on and that's it. No prep whatsoever. I wouldn't recommend. Waitress was nice and had some fun songs on the radio which is the only reason I didn't give it a 1 star. But don't waste your time and money, we won't again. Giant Eagle prepared food would have been way better and way cheaper than the 70 bucks with tip we spent for the two of us. (I don't really like giant eagle food...) Regret going."}
{"text":"The food was actually really good. It was a little slow to come, especially considering that the place wasn't very busy at the time, but it was worth the wait.  The service was awful. As I said, there weren't a lot of people in the restaurant but the waitress still wasn't attentive. It was hard to get refills and when the food finally came she mixed up who had ordered what.  We weren't the only dissatisfied customers that day either. Another woman went to the manager to make a complaint and although I didn't hear a word she said to him, he raised his voice immediately and said she was being irate with him. Then he proceeded to tell her that he had just gotten there for the day and that he was not responsible for whatever complaint she had. He made a scene where I otherwise would not have even noticed the lady's complaint, and he made excuses (loudly!) instead of fixing whatever problem she had. And then after the woman left, the manager told the waitress that he wanted her name off the credit card she had used to pay! I cannot think of a single valid reason that he would want this and that does make me uneasy about paying by card here.  The management and wait staff were very clearly inexperienced here. I loved the food itself but I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to stop in here for a while, but just like most every restaurant in Irwin, it was always packed. I read the yelp reviews, which are quite mixed. Anyway, I wasn't sure what to expect. My husband and I stopped in for dinner last night, and were seated immediately by a waitress...I didn't see a hostess on duty. Another waitress came over quickly to take care of us. I had the St. Louis Ribs (half rack), which came with fries and cole slaw ($14). My husband got the Hand-Cut Tenderloin Sandwich with fries ($12).   Pros: The place is decorated nicely and is very clean. Although, it is a newer place so it should be. You can see the kitchen through a glass wall, which I like. There are separate areas - a bar area, dining, outside seating, and even a small room for private parties. I enjoyed my meal - for the most part - and felt that the portion sizes were good for the amount of food you got. My husband also enjoyed his meal (as well as what I couldn't eat of mine).   Cons: Our waitress suggested getting the dry rub with bbq sauce on the side, which is what I did. It was good, but the ribs were simply too dry, even with the sauce. They certainly weren't the 'fall off the bone' ribs I was hoping for. Also, the service was just okay. We had to ask for everything: napkins and wet-naps (I am eating ribs....), drink refills, the check. Also, the place wasn't that busy, and our waitress was kind of absent. I noticed that the other waitress, the one who seated us, was running around all over the place, and she had a table of eight to boot. Ours never even asked how our meal was.   Overall, not a bad experience. I would stop in again, but probably not my first choice."}
{"text":"Stopped in just before happy hour, the place was empty, two tables and an empty bar. I ordered a Long Island ice tea and shrimp tacos. The Long Island was badly poured and excessively tart. The shrimp \"tacos\" were served on very lightly toasted pita bread. The shrimp were unseasoned. I sat at the bar as I was alone. There were three patrons at the bar when I left at 530. Surprisingly, the bartender brought my check without asking if I wanted anything else. I got the distinct impression that they just didn't care. I said good bye when I left, three employees standing by the door stared blankly. An average rating is a kindness. Perhaps it was an off day. But if you don't know the difference between a taco and pita bread...."}
{"text":"Came here after the restaurant I was planning on going to was booked. The inside was typical new restaurant that looks like they built super fast and didn't use quality materials. We were served quite fast. Sat at a table not the bar.   The food was alright. Had a burger and salad with steak. The portions were smaller than most restaurants like this. There were only 6 pieces of steak with the salad when you paid a considerable amount more to add. The ingredients were fresh which I liked.   Overall, for the quality of the food and atmosphere, the price of food didn't meet expectations. If they had better specials or happy hour deals would go back. But not paying full price"}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this restaurant. We did like the nachos with brisket appetizer. It was the best thing our table had. Our server was nice and friendly. She did a very nice job for our table. For our meals, two of our party had ribs. One had it with the wet bbq sauce. It looked tender but had some gristle. The other had the dry rub. It was spicy and dry and charred. I had the grilled Cesar salad. It was drowned with dressing and inedible. The server did well to take it back and provided the salmon BLT sandwich in return. It was better. Overall though, the food was not something that we would come back for. It was a bit of a disappointment. :("}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant! Amazing food, cocktails (especially the Moscow Mules), and ambiance. They have a beautiful patio, great entertainment every weekend, and lots of fun holiday events. Definitely the go-to spot of the area!"}
{"text":"I'm always excited for new restaurants in the area.  I was a little confused by their menu as I assumed they'd have different pizza since wood fired grill is in their name.  I ordered a lemoncello fizz (yummy!) to drink and the porkchops with corn bread and cauliflower.  It was an excellent pork chop and both sides were great too -- especially the corn bread.  I'll definitely be back to try their burgers and salads that also looked good."}
{"text":"The staff at this restaurant are truely kind, caring, and provide a lovely dining experience. I was especially happy with the treatment of my grandparents. They shared an order of a sandwich and their meal was brought out on two plates already proportioned in smaller amounts. This made splitting the meal between them very easy. The food was delicious (as always) and the Saturday deal on Long Island Ice tea is awesome!! I also like the sesign of the interior. We love to come to this restaurant together as a family. Thank you for making the experience easier on my grandparents. It means a lot!"}
{"text":"I truly like this restaurant.  4 vs. 5 stars because it's way too loud and loud because of poor acoustics, not because of rowdy, obnoxious patrons.  So, having to talk really loud across the table is a less-than-desirable experience.  Otherwise, a quite nice outing here.  Our server was very friendly and helpful.  The menu -- that's really the standout.  Many options I would have ordered that sounded delicious with a variety of vegetables, colors, and flavors.    I like that you can see all the flurry of activity in the kitchen.  There's also a bar area with many tvs and there was live music this night, though the sound of it wasn't particularly to my liking this go-round.  I decided on the pulled pork tacos with corn, avocado, and beans inside served as a threesome in soft flour shells and a red sauce on the side.  Instead of fries, I selected the parmesan cheese cauliflower.  All of these decisions were spot-on.  Flavorful and satisfying.  My husband ordered ribs.  I took a bite and they were quite nice.  I definitely would return to try other menu options and, perhaps, listen to some live music here."}
{"text":"Love this place. Went to lunch with a friend and the vibe/atmosphere was great. The service was also very good. I got the Carolina brisket sandwich and it was full of flavor and cooked perfect. Looking forward to going there again."}
{"text":"Prices are fair for lunch, ambience is very welcoming and the wait staff on this visit was accommodating and spot on. The fries are GREAT :) portions are GREAT, lets see...its all pretty much GREAT. Go there :)"}
{"text":"Pretty good food and nice Atmosphere! We like to get the pizza and the dessert menu is really good! They also have some good specialty drinks! We've never been to the bar there but it looks pretty cool!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant with superb appetizers, awesome selection of drinks/beers/wines and very very contemporary atmosphere!!  Love the open patio!!  Owners are unbelievably approachable, friendly and attentive.     Food is great!!    One of the coolest restaurant/bars in town!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"We stopped by on the weekend. The food was good and service was excellent. Prices were somewhat high, but we would go again"}
{"text":"What a great place!  They have really listened to their customers.   They have grown into a great destination.  Nice place to go for casual or special occasion. Recently decided to go there after our Son's graduation from High school-plus the Penguins were playing game 6.  They set us up with great outdoor table looking into bar TVs.   Every entree and appetizer were done well, excellent choices of local beers and wine--and topped it off by comping the Graduate's dinner.   Food, Staff, Owners and atmosphere all top notch!!"}
{"text":"In town for work, decided to check this place out.  Everything was tasty and fresh.  I ordered the \"Charred Shrimp Cocktail\" and the \"Just For The Kale Salad\" to start.  The shrimp had a really nice spice rub flavor.  The Kale salad was very tasty, I particularly liked the celery seed dressing.  For my entrée, I ordered the Faroe Island Salmon.  This dish was excellent.  The Salmon was fresh and wood fire grilled to my desired doneness.  The Yukon Gold and Sweet potato hash was very tasty, as were the wood grilled asparagus.  I will be coming back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I have tried a few of their offerings such as: Wood Grilled Pretzels which I don't think belong any where near a grill but to each his own. Carolina Brisket sandwich which I have to be honest was so bad that not only did I send it back but I seriously wanted to offer the chef some advice on how to bring this dish up to par. It lacked a flavor profile and would have been beaten hands down by anything at your local summer fair. I traded it in for the Salmon BLT (which I got sans bacon since I don't eat pork). It was perfectly cooked and not over done; definitely will order again. On another occasion I had the Turkey and Brie Burger and it is absolutely excellent! The turkey patty is well seasoned and I appreciated the way the Brie and apple onion jam pair well together. Lastly I have had the Sweet & Salty Cheesecake and I like it. It has a nice consistency and who doesn't like a sweet n salty flavor? I have had a few of their drinks as well and they don't hold anything back on the liquor so drink responsibly. The service is above average and I feel welcomed whenever I enter this place of business."}
{"text":"I came here with my wife on a Sunday night.  The indoor seating is nice, but we enjoyed sitting on the patio.  I had the Carolina Brisket sandwich which was very good.  My wife had the steak sandwich that she also enjoyed.  I'd give it a go again."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were super excited to watch this place being built every time we went to target. When it finally opened, we could wait to see the inside because a name like \"The Fire Pit\" sounds awesome.  The decorations were pretty basic, not a lot of fire pits like I was expecting. The bar is huge and has a garage door that can open to give it an open air bar feel.   The menu is mostly made up of trendy BBQ dishes. Unfortunately, the dinner entrees are not available until after 4 so, we stuck with an entree and shared a 3 chicken taco dish. The Brisket Nachos that our waitress recommended were amazing, huge, and very filling. After having an incredible 1st dish, we were a little disappointed with the lack of flavor in our chicken tacos.  The prices are average and the food and service are above average. Therefore, we agreed that we would be back! Next time we will defineitly come after 4 to have more options on the menu and to take advantage of their Happy Hour from 5-7."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, fun decor, fantastic food. I opted for the turkey burger and a side of cauliflower. The bigger was fresh and delicious with generous avocado and arugula. The cauliflower was perfectly cooked.,"}
{"text":"Firepit Wood Fired Grille is a welcomed a change from the typical franchised restaurants one finds throughout suburbia. The casual atmosphere makes for a great  lunch or dinner spot to hangout with friends/family or catch a game on the bar's televisions (if you're into that).   For our first visit we all ordered a mixture of sandwiches, soups, and salads. I had the Buffalo Chicken Wrap, which I was expecting to be pretty good cause it's a rather simple order that's hard to mess up. However, after one bite I was wishing I had ordered something/anything else. The chicken tasted as though it was simply boiled in water and not given much attention to it during its preparation. Plus, the wrap sauce lacked the spiciness that I've come to expect when I read the word \"buffalo\" on the menu. Needless to say I was left disappointed and a little bit hungry, because I did not finish the wrap.   As this is a new addition to the Irwin area, I understand that it'll take some time to work out the hiccups. I'm willing to give it another try, but I won't be ordering the Buffalo Chicken Wrap again for quite some time."}
{"text":"A few friends and I decided to try The Firepit being that it was a new restaurant in the area and figured the atmosphere sounded cool. We walked into the restaurant and stopped at the hostess desk but there was no hostess. We waited for a little while to see when he/she would come back to seat us but nobody came. None of the other employees noticed we were even there! So we sat up at the bar to have a few drinks and try some food. Looking around, the atmosphere was bland. They splashed some orange paint on the walls and called it a day. There were paper fliers on the walls around the restrooms which I thought was super tacky. They do have an indoor to outdoor patio with a fire pit which was pretty cool. We went on a Tuesday which happened to be the day that their mules were on special for $5. They were delicious, probably the best thing I had at the entire restaurant. We each chose an appetizer to try from their happy hour menu. We had a house salad, some cheese fries, and a margarita pizza. Now, the food was not terrible, but I certainly won't be back for it. The pizza looked like it was made with the Naan bread that you can buy at the store and tasted like cheap cheese. The service from the bartender (whom we found out was new) was prompt and she was very friendly. I did notice other employees and what seemed to be management standing around and talking to each other which looked pretty bad even if the restaurant was dead. In my opinion, the only thing going for this place is the bar and the firepit patio. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great evening at the Firepit. Enjoyed drinks and apps on the patio with my daughter and a friend and her daughter. Wings were very tasty. Felt like i was in California.  Relaxed vibe."}
{"text":"When they first opened I went once or twice and then stoped going..... why I don't know. This place is great, nice outdoor area for drinks and dinner. Foods always fantastic and drinks are always good. Only reason I gave it 4 stars is the service is sometimes slow on off days"}
{"text":"Great food & awesome drinks.  I enjoy the sangria.  Wood fired grill items are a good choice.  Menu items that are different that you don't see everywhere."}
