{"text":"The 4-star is an average of a declining star-rating over three visits - I hope this review finds the owner in time to turn the ship around!

Visit 1: 5-star
The octopus - a main-stay of the Roncesvalles location - did not disappoint. Some of the best in the world! The Campbell Park pizza - a source of neighbourhood pride! After two bites I knew this was to be our standing order. An incredible mix of toppings melding together perfectly. A $5 Thursday night cocktail special was a fantastic accompaniment.

Visit 2: 4-star
The octopus - for the first time ever - was sub-par. Chewy, likely overcooked and with very little flavour. And perhaps it was spiciness leftover from our other pizza, but I could swear the Campbell Park had a spicy sauce this time. For me it was just unnecessary, but for others with a low-tolerance for spice it was a disappointment.

Visit 3: 3-star
For the first time ever we took a pass on the octopus hoping time will heal our wounds. Meanwhile the Campbell Park had me doubting my memory - the toppings seemed clunky and under-cooked, which brought attention to the dough which seemed chewy in places, and burned in others. The pizza arrived lightening-fast, which at first was welcomed, but then suspicious. Was also disappointed to find the absence of a Thursday night cocktail special! Fortunately, a shining light was the Pompei - every once in a while I try an anchovy pizza in hopes of acquiring the taste, and this time did it. The combination with the olives was exactly what was needed!"}
{"text":"The difference between my review being a 3-star and 5-star rating is the service delivery. The food was incredible, it's just too bad I had to wait 2 hours to be able to taste it. 

This rating by no means is reflective of the hostess, waitstaff, or bartender (they were exceptional), but more of a failure on the part of management. We came in on a Friday at 7PM, anticipating that we were going to have to wait a bit for a table. Throughout the day I tried calling to make a reservation, but no answer (and I could not reserve online or leave a message). We were told a 30-40 minute wait, but were confused with the sheer amount of reserved tables that were clearly not claimed, including a table of 16 reserved for 7:30 that sat empty until we left at 10PM. 

Once we got table, it took considerable time for our drinks, apps, and pizzas to arrive, and in between these long waits no one cared to check on us (except the wonderful sommelier who was exceptional). Perhaps I will eat here again, but I will definitely come at a less busier time."}
{"text":"Defina Wood Fired is a new addition to the Junction Triangle so we booked in last minute for a Friday night dinner.

Arrived around 6pm and our table for two was ready to go.  My DC was running a few minutes behind so it gave me some time to eye the menu.  She is gluten-free so I wanted to make sure there would be some options for her.

When she arrived, we quickly ordered two glasses of white wine and were going to order the meatballs (no go since there are bread crumbs in there) and share a pizza on a gluten-free crust. We were a bit disappointed when our waitress told us that they were out of gluten-free crust!  

We reorganized our order and got crispy green beans ($10), brussel sprouts with bacon ($10) and the flank steak ($19) to share.  Seemed a bit weird to be in a pizza place and not order pizza but I didn't want to eat a whole one to self and she didn't have a gluten-free option.

Service was fine for the most part, a bit slow between the main and dessert delivery - we got the creme brulee ($9) to share.  And our busboy dropped a small container oil when he came to pick up our dishes, which splashed everywhere and left oil stains on my jeans!

Might be back to try the pizza but will leave gluten-free friend at home next time."}
{"text":"The food was amazing - got their award winning pizza (best pizza I've ever had) and their calamari was to die for. Excellent customer service, gave us free drinks for waiting 10mins to be seated. Will definitely be back again with friends."}
