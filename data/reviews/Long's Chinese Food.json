{"text":"Long's is a good Szechuan bet any time you want a full meal.   I chose the boiled sliced fish filet with chilis (low heat) and a small bowl of rice, and while waiting, the very typical Chinese waitress brought out a treat, a saucer of complimentary pickled cabbage. A plain dish, nonetheless a pleasant pre-extension of Chinese gratitude. I very much enjoyed the large bowl of fish fillet (although not as flavourful as one other Sichuan restaurant in the city), and the bean sprouts were so plentiful as to act as noodles otherwise would (no, not on stage).  The light and fluffy rice was mini-grained, and most agreeable. I appreciated a pot of mild cha, especially when the spicy bite bit into my sometimes sensitive throat. Regarding the mains on their menu, certainly worth returning for a chicken, broccoli, and beef dish next time!  The fish soup was so big that I took a full meal home to reheat the next day, and let me enthusiastically add that it was just as delicious. Simply added some mixed nuts for more body, and wow. Very nice!  Before they left, spoke to a small family of former mainland Chinese people who said that they come to Long's frequently: they ordered 4 mains as well as a sizable warm-pot of rice, and left with several containers of take-out (wi'di). Is pretty cool within earshot of the restaurant staff to get 'insider' confirmation of repeatedly enjoying the food.  This restaurant is attractively decorated with fine tables and chairs, and had a clean-smelling men's washroom: although somewhat cluttered in spots, especially with the table-clearing trolleys very much in the dining area, but nothing unusual if one knows Oriental Asian cultures at all. I'd give Long's 3.75 stars so far, but that's not cast in concrete...  Check Long's out, Szechuan fans.  I don't think you'll be at all disappointed.  Certainly over time I'll return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"If you like spicy Szechuan food, live in the hood, and want a filling and homestyle meal, Long's is good. My husband was taken aback by the service and ambience, but I wasn't too fussed. I do think the restaurant is understaffed. I'm here for the food. If you do care about service and the ambience, just get takeout.   I usually get the dan dan noodles. It's odd that they use spaghetti noodles but the sauce is just lovely. The boiled fish with vegetables was silky smooth and tender. A huge portion for $18.95. I'm fond of the dumplings as well. The food is spicy, which I love. I felt like they could have kicked up the heat but I didn't know how to request that in Mandarin."}
{"text":"My favourite Szechuan restaurant. Crazy spicy! Love the numbing peppers. This is not for the weak spice eaters. Cold noodles, spicy fish soup, broccoli, zucchini, eggplant, pork and jalape√±o, beef and cumin, and spicy chicken are awesome. Everything is spicy though! Service isn't the best but if you love Chinese food, then you already know what the service will be like."}
{"text":"I have been reading about this place on a few of my favourite blogs and thought that today was a great time to go for it.   We went shortly before noon and there was only one other table when we sat down. After a very quick look at the menu we ordered the Dan Dan Noodles, Steamed Pork Belly, the Dumplings in Sweet Garlic Sauce and the Deep Fried Chicken with Chilli Peppers. Immediately they brought out a dish of Sweet and Spicy Pickled Vegetables.  I could not stop eating them. They were slightly sweet but had the spice that you feel at the back of your throat. Delish!! The first dish out was the noodles and we wasted no time in mixing the noodles with the sauce and trying it out.  At first we thought that it was kind of strange to get spaghetti noodles in a Chinese restaurant but they were really perfect. The ideal balance of sweet and spice and noodle and....  everything else. The chicken came next and we were a little wary because there were so many peppers but somehow it was perfectly balanced. I liked the flavour that came from leaving the bones in but wish the pieces were a bit bigger. The dumplings came out and they were the perfect dish to balance the others. Sweet and not spicy but there was A LOT of garlic. I loved it but suspect the people around me for the rest of the day may not have.   I really enjoyed my first experience with Szechwan food and can't wait to go back and try other things or maybe try out Szechwan Restaurant."}
{"text":"I had high expectations from the great reviews I read, but the food was just mediocre. Decent flavors and good technique, but there was barely any heat. None of the dishes we tried tasted authentic. Service was pretty bad. There was no one around when we walked in at noon, we stood around awkwardly for 5 minutes until someone came out. She seated us, gave us menus and tea, then disappeared again. After waiting a long time for her to come back to take our orders, we finally had to call out loud for her to come back!"}
{"text":"Since adopting a vegetarian diet; this has become one of my go to spots. They have several stir-fry vegetable dishes that are to die for. I recommend the stir-fry zuchinni, stir-fry broccoli and stir-fry king oyster mushrooms. If you like spice, get it fried with dried chilis."}
{"text":"Szechuan comes to 17th! HUGE thumbs up  We got the spicy cucumber with garlic, the diced chicken with cauliflower, and the stir fried broccoli with garlic (could also have got it with oyster sauce). Large order of rice. The cukes are delicious, spicy as hell and not a lot like the cucumber salad we've at at eg Delicious Country. This one is more savoury with a dressing that has peanut in it as well as something fermented we couldn't put our finger on. The chicken-oh my God the chicken- okay first there might be something missing in translation because it was indeed diced (and boneless) dark meat (thank God) but the veggies were long beans and bell peppers, not cauliflower, but we didn't care terribly because the beans are cooked perfectly and this is one spicy, savoury, floral, mysterious dish that is increasingly addicting the more you eat of it. One of the best Chinese dishes I've ever had in Calgary or at any Chinese resto period. It definitely has Szechuan peppercorn but none of the grit I usually associate with it but the same odd chemical flavour- but persevere, it grows on you. It's stunning. The broccoli was the opposite of the chicken: simple, simply seasoned with just light soy sauce and garlic and perfectly cooked, amazing skill in this kitchen to be able to pull off something as complex as the chicken dish and as simple as the broccoli and to have them both be COMPLETELY delicious in wildly different ways. So three dishes and a large rice (enough for three) was $35. I'll be back again and again. I am so happy to live near this place."}
