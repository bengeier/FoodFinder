{"text":"I used to come here back in the day and came here recently to check it out. I had to leave the place because the service made me feel uncomfortable. It was basically some young kid who didn't even greet us and acted like he did not care. I saw a bunch of these kids when the door to the kitchen opened as well. My opinion is if you don't give a crap about your job, you don't care about the quality of the good etc. that worries me and I rather go somewhere else.   We won't be returning here. In fact I drove by there this week and their sign was down so not sure if it's renovation or they closed??"}
{"text":"Had breakfast at Smitty's with the rents - i don't think this place is very good My eggs were cooked ok but i ordered a fruit cup on the side and it tasted like it was off - i think they pre-make them and let them sit in the fridge for a week ( i guess most ppl opt for hashbrowns over the fruit cup) and most of the fruit was syrupy and from a can - that's the worst  i think there are much better breakfast places around"}
{"text":"I have been here several times for breakfast.  The one thing it has going for it is the friendly service.  Waitresses go out of their way to make sure you are being taken care of.  That is appreciated (which is why I've given it 2 stars).  Food is below average.  Nothing special.  The fresh fruit option is missing the \"fresh\" component.  I have ordered it more than once (thinking that maybe I just had a bad experience before), but it was the same dried out fruit the second time as well.   I ordered pancakes with fresh berry topping and got a canned/sweetened fruit jam on top instead.    There are other breakfast places I will go to before picking this one again."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday for breakfast with my mom and bros.....the service was okay, the food was good and portions are generous. Our waitress was  really attentive, maybe over the top. But she was nice   We got stared down by the people here while we ate, and it was kind of uncomfortable. Maybe because we were the only Hispanic family surround by Caucasians? I don't know...  I would probably come back only for the food, but the atmosphere I didn't like, hence the reason why I gave this place 2 stars."}
{"text":"I've come here for breakfast a few times.  If you like breakfast, you will like this place.  You can also order lunch during breakfast hours, which is certaintly a plus.  I like eating hamburgers and pasta for lunch once in a while!  Service is always good.  Lots of room for sitting.  Not the nicest looking place, but on par with Denny's.  Nice little diner, and then you can go to Chapter's or some other places for shopping afterwards, good times.    Food quality is good.  About 11.99 for eggs, toast, bacon and sausage.  If I remember correctly.  It's a cheaper option than Coras.    Derek"}
