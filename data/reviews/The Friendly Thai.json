{"text":"I prefer this location to the other ones in the city. We live really close to the Queen West one, but order delivery or dine-in at this one.

Dine in service is always friendly, and quick. Dishes are veganizable, there are lots of options, the food is always tasty and the portions are huge (we're eaters, but we still end up taking food home with us). The food could be spicier, but that seems pretty standard in this city and nothing a bit of hot sauce can't fix.

My delivery experiences have varied. When I order things through Order-It or Just Eat,  the resulting delivery takes forever, there are often issues with our order (like egg in the pad thai when we specifically said vegan/no egg), and the prices are more expensive than just ordering directly. 

So we started calling them to place delivery orders and things went much more smoothly. Orders seemed to come faster with no mistakes."}
{"text":"Although the waitress was very nice, I still have to give this place one star based on the dish we ordered. If you like fresh, spicy, well prepared Thai food there are far better options. The spring rolls were bland, and the Pad Thai was even worse. It was likely prepared by someone with limited knowledge of Thai cuisine, and tasted as if someone had doused the noodles in ketchup, and then stirred in some green onions. Old, frozen shrimp in the dish added an element of unpleasant fishyness. Could I taste a hint of that nice sourness that tamarind paste delivers? Not at all. Served with a lemon? Come on now."}
{"text":"The pad Thai tasted worse than spaghetti with ketchup. Me and my friend could not eat more than 2 spoons.

Basil beef was ok. Nothing to write home about.

Service was friendly. Atmosphere was ok.

Overpriced. Save your money and time.

I also happened to notice that dine in specials can be 6 dollars cheaper than the same dish ordered take out. I know lotsa places do this but I still hate it when restos do things like that. Makes me feel that you are being punished for ordering take out."}
{"text":"I've eaten here or ordered from this place a few times over the years and have never had a horrible experience.  The food is decent and reasonably priced.  

Unfortunately, I am writing this review because of a bad experience that I had.  I ordered food there yesterday and when I started eating my veggie spring roll, I bit into something hard.  It was a dark green cone shaped object.  At first I thought it was an incense cone, but it was made of hard plastic and appeared to have broken off from something - a tool or an instrument of some kind.  I brought it back to the restaurant and the worker showed it to the cook who did not recognize the object and could not explain how it ended up in my spring roll.  If the spring rolls are made in house, then the object came from the kitchen somewhere and it is disconcerting that it was unexplained.  

The worker could only offer me a free spring roll.   

With other Thai options in the area, I won't be returning to The Friendly Thai anytime soon.  Potentially breaking a tooth puts a bit of a damper on the eating experience.  I find it very interesting that someone else recently had a similar experience (a staple was found), I think more attention needs to be made when cooking!"}
{"text":"Ordered Veggie Pad Thai and was less than impressed. The sauce was a heavy tomato base that I can only liken to Campbell's Tomato Soup. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Did you know there are currently 8 Friendly Thai restaurants in Toronto? I didn't.

This location is the best one that I've tried, and it was also the first (they say you always remember your first...).

Located deep in the heart of Roncesvalles village, sandwiched between arguably the best produce shop in Toronto (Maple Produce) and a decent coffee bar (Lit), The Friendly Thai was a mainstay of mine when I lived in the neighbourhood.

Food: Exceptionally tasty. My favourite and recommended dish: Chicken Curry Pad Thai ($10.99). I almost always order this dish. If you get take-out or delivery, it comes in a generously-sized container (they actually used to have a larger take-out container but sadly retired it a couple years back in favour of the more economical size currently in use) with a side of peanuts. Add a side serving of coconut rice and you've got yourself a meal, friend!

Service: Ranging anywhere from pleasant to unhelpful and rude, depending on the person working that night. I like to think of the quality of service I'll receive in game-like terms, akin to playing Wheel of Fortune. For example, 'What kind of service will I get this time? Spin the wheel. Crap service! Oh, how unfortunate.

Ambience: Intimate and cozy. Dine-in is a viable option at this location. The decor is warm and inviting, and when the place gets packed, it is a very fun and lively space to enjoy a meal."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. The food took forever and staff was rude about it. Would never go back again."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  The food is pretty good though I always order the same
thing (chicken fried rice and cashew nut chicken).  The delivery time can be long but I guess
that depends on what time of day you are calling.  Anyways, overall good food."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a lovely autumn day off.  I had the vegetarian hot and sour soup and the Pad See Ew (sp?) with chicken.  The soup was sweeter than I've had before, but was delicious.  The Pad See Ew came with more vegetables than I've had it with before, as usually it's just chinese broccoli, but it too was yummy.
I appreciated that I could sit anywhere I chose and was warned that the table I chose was usually quite hot.  I was okay with that."}
{"text":"The food is good IF they get your order right.

I ordered a vegetable pad thai for delivery. It was loaded with chicken. And no vegetables."}
{"text":"Don't bother; Friendly Thai need to up their game. 

Like another reviews have stated; their food used to be great. Now every time I order from here I am more than disappointed. 

My garlic shrimp order had two shrimp in it and the rest mushrooms. My house noodles order came with one bite of noodles and the rest vegetables.  Spring rolls were near frozen on the inside. I paid $50 for a meal that I literally threw three quarters of in the garbage.

I hope they can turn it back around because I think they are a good fit for the community  but I will not be going here again until I see some stellar reviews."}
{"text":"I wouldn't post this if I didn't watch the whole thing .. But I was sitting down in the restaurant when \"Adam L\" I over heard the conversation and your picture kinda helps with the identification process. Firstly .. It wasn't at all him who made the remark about the online pricing it was his partner (assuming) there was a woman with him. And the \"valley girl\" responded with \"sorry, we're not in charge of changing online prices\" which makes sense .. cause since when are servers In charge of web design.  Then the woman replied with \"woah that's a strange attitude\"  

A+ on the paraphrasing though. Next time you try to pick on someone for no reason you should probably at the very least tell the story the way it happened."}
{"text":"My friend and I chose this place after a long day of work.  I also had been wanting to try it. When we entered the server/host said to sit anywhere. We took the seats closest to the window. After being in the restaurant for 10 mins, I had overheard a mixup in one order and a complaint about incosistancy in the quality of food. 
I order veg spring rolls, hot and sour soup(veg) and oodles of noodles(veg).
my friend ordered avocado spring rolls, seafood curry and Malay bread.
 the spring rolls were good. The soup was nice and spicy. But the curry apparently was bland and they users frozen mussels(sacrificing quality for cost). The best was when the Malay bread came. My friend had just been to Malaysia and is herself Malay, and the bread we got was store variety over toasted pita bread quartered. Ha. Our server came over and we informed her that it was not right. On top of it all the oodles of noodles were greasey and tastless and looked as though peices of the wok were mix in as well. Two bites in and I gave up. It was by far the grossest thing i ever had. 
Once again our server came to make sure everything was okay. I let her know that my noodles were not good an she said she would talk to the manager.

The whole time we had been there a weasley looking man sat in the corner and I felt a little uncomfortable at times cause I would notice that he was looking our way. Since we were the only eat in guests there. He was in fact the manager. When he was informed, he dissapeared in to the kitchen several times and then came towards our table. He addressed my friend first, when corrected he informed me that they added a tiny bit of oil and that it was neccesary. Okay fine, but it was inedible. After having a small awkward aguement that made my friend and our server alittle uncomfortable we paid our bill and left. Needless to say I will not be going there again.

(we were not charged, but the arguement was not needed)"}
{"text":"The pad thai here is very bad.  Ketchup seems to be the only ingredient in the sauce.   Tastes more like mac and cheese with a ton of  ketchup than pad thai.   My companions and I all ordered pad thai so I can't say whether any other dishes hit the spot.   We agreed it was the worst thai food we had and wouldn't be back.  

Other notes:
- Was there for lunch and our big entrees came with a salad and spring roll (flavourless) for under $10.  
- waitress was friendly, but tI didn't care for the manners of the manager (owner?) and the tone he used when talking to us and bringing out our dishes.  
- I thought the restaurant smelled a bit like a bathroom and felt sick at the thought of drinking the water at the table.  I don't know if my companions noticed it.  I didn't mention it since I didn't want to hurt the feelings of the person who chose this place"}
{"text":"Always delicious, always consistent, always good value. Love this food. One of my top Thai places, and I've tried many. One note for management - get the kitchen vent/hood fixed! For about 2 years smoke and smell have been backing up into the restaurant, chasing us out and into neighbouring establishments. I'd love to be able to come back and enjoy a meal there, but I'll be relying on take-out until you take care of this problem."}
{"text":"We got take-out from this place last night as our regular place was closed. Their advertised 20% off pick-up is false advertising.  I asked why I didn't get it, despite it being widely promoted all over the internet, including their site, the not-so-bright server said that they just don't do it, and that the ad is a mistake (despite other locations honouring it,....).  When I got home they had also forgotten my order of mango salad.  Ms. Bright offered generously for me to come and get it myself.  I have to admit, the food was good, but I can't give them or promote their business when they're clearly falsely advertising and have no interest in customer service. There is no email address in which to contact them, which is quite telling in itself."}
{"text":"This place is sometimes okay, often not. If you dine in, service is lacking.Take out isn't much better, and like other reviewers, I've been told over the phone that policies have changed on a whim. This place needs some competition in the area!"}
{"text":"Just finished eating the best takeout meal. Food was seasoned perfectly, more than generous serving, fresh crisp vegetables and the sauces were so delicious I wanted to drink the leftovers. #newfavtakeout"}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere! Came here with a group of friends for dinner. Ambience was amazing. Server pleasantly guided us to order their appetiser plate, green curry, some classic pad Thai and crispy beef with coconut rice. Appetiser plate was massive! Delicious mango and the calamari was crisp fried to perfection. Their coconut rice is to die for! Will definitely be back. Hopefully next time we have place for dessert :)"}
{"text":"I ordered delivery. It was 40 minutes late. When the delivery guy arrives he shoves a receipt in my face to sign while he holds the bag.So I sign it then he shoves the food in my hands and walks away. I come to find out the drink I paid for isn't in the bag and even though I specified no tofu in my Pad Thai-there was tofu. And the pad Thai wasn't very flavorful. Contacted the store the next day, was told I'd get a call back and nothing. Shitty customer service and delayed delivery times. Do NOT recommend. Also it's a lesson not to pay/tip before getting your food. Lesson learned. I'll stick with Thai Lime from now on."}
{"text":"Pros - reasonable prices, prompt delivery, friendly service.
Cons - bland, greasy, sugary."}
{"text":"Horrible quality: everything was the same colour brown, greasy and flavourless. \"Food\" was slathered in onions and lemons making it even more inedible.  Dishes that were promoted to have vegetables had NONE.  Service was non existent.  Delivery person was unable to operate a basic intercom system; it took 15 EXTRA minutes on top of the 75 minutes to get the delivery.  ZERO STARS (not available)"}
{"text":"Live in the area and order at least once a week for a couple of years.  Never thought I would write a review, but because of poor customer service last night, January 26, 2015, want to voice my experience.  Ordered food as usual for take out.  Picked it up, should have looked in bag because all order wasn't there when I got home.  Freezing cold, called the restaurant to say didn't receive an item.  Was put on hold actually for a longer time than needed, the young lady returned to the phone and said I complained about not received the same item back in September! She made it sound like I was trying to get a free spring roll, made me feel like I was lying and her tone of voice certainly changed to angry.  LOL!  Been ordering food there a long time, time to find a more customer friendly restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food, attentive service, and very reasonably priced. Will definitely come back when I am in the area... Very generous portions as well. Could not finish it...."}
{"text":"Crappy Service!  I walked in as a brand new customer and ordered take out.  The girl at the desk that took my order said it would be 15 minutes.  I looked around and there was NO ONE in the restaurant---so I had my suspicions.  I waited 20 minutes and then observed one of the waitresses sit down and was eating a meal very similar to mine.  She didn't make eye contact with me as she was eating so I found that to be suspect.  I then had to wait an additional 20 minutes.  Finally my order came out and the food was not at all worth the wait!  I will very likely NOT return.  Better restaurants around.  I wish them all the best but I'm a 1st and a last customer of theirs."}
{"text":"We have ordered from here in the past and have been pleased with the food. But tonight the service is appalling. We ordered in, the person taking the order told us it would be here in 45 minutes, and I'm writing this at the 1 hour mark. When I called in, the assistant manager, Kate, began to tell me how long it was \"really\" taking, and that the person I was speaking to told me \"within an hour\" instead of 45 minutes. Now that's a bit rich... Bad service will always trump the quality of the food. Like I said, the food here was good, but management and the servers have no sense of courtesy or customer service.

Update: At 1 hour and 45 minutes the delivery guy showed up. This is 1 hour after they told us the food would be here, and 45 minutes after we cancelled the order. Good grief."}
{"text":"I ordered take away oodles of noodles vegetarian yesterday for lunch. I got home, and using my computer, ate with one hand. The first couple bites were grainy - I thought this was pepper, and then I took a bite and my mouth was filled with sharp shards - I spat everything out, and it was bits of sharp burnt black plastic. On close inspection, there was a ton of these shards throughout my dish. I called the restaurant right away, and photographed the plastic shards, but the owner was \"busy out doing deliveries\" and a day later has still not returned my call. I have filed a complaint with Toronto Health. Don't eat here. I have no idea how much plastic I actually ate."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery - pad thai was pasty, no lime, no coriander. Shrimp coconut curry was awful. Overly sweet and the shrimp was way too fishy for my liking. Just yuck. It is all sitting my fridge right now because I hate to waste... but a HUGE waste of $28."}
{"text":"I have been eating ther for almost 20 years at friendly thai.awesome place for ever.friendly thai is everywhere in toronto to give us best thai food."}
{"text":"This is THE WORST Thai restaurant I've ever been to!!! I've dined in twice- both the worst experience but the food was edible. I also had delivery and it took an hour and a half... I live less than 5 minutes away! When I called, three times, to ask where my food was, I was hung up on, and told by the woman on the phone \"I don't know what to tell you\". I was so shocked and disappointed. Not only was it hugely expensive, but it took forever, and the Pad Thai is AWFUL. I've been to Thailand many times, not to mention the plethora of Thai restaurant in and out of the city- and NEVER have I come across a \"powdery\" Pad Thai. It was so dry and flavourless. It was basically a bunch of noodles mixed with powder. Seriously- don't even bother. I asked for the manager to return my call- still to this day- haven't heard back."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was subpar. The fresh veggie rolls consisted of 90% lettuce. Our chicken wings were overcooked and black. The lemon chicken soup had two small pieces of chicken and three large pieces of ginger. Pad Thai was okay."}
{"text":"We dropped into this place on Saturday to grab some tofu because we really needed some protein. We were pleasantly surprised when the tofu was exceptionally tasty! We had both the fried tofu and tofu skewers, and they came with an amazing peanut sauce that actually had chunks of peanuts in it. It was so good that we decided to head back for dinner and get full meals. The service was also very friendly, and the prices were reasnable. I had the lychee lemongrass tofu, and it was SO yummy! I ate some leftover for lunch the following day and was still satisfied! I would definitely go back for more!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my lady friend. LOVE the decor, but I like that kitschy type of thing :D

SERVICE: Great! our waitress was attentive and pleasant. Even though it was terribly busy, she made time to take a picture for us.Speedy delivery of food and cheque.

FOOD: Average. I had the cashwew nut chicken lunch special. It came with a tasty spring roll and small green salad. The dish itself was well seasoned and the chicken was plentiful. The onions in the dish were quite large and undercooked as were the peppers. The sauce was spicy and very tasty.  My friend had the spicy beef noodles and loved it!

Overall, for lunch specials startng at $7 that include a spring roll,salad and a big plate of food with rice, you cant beat it. I would go back again."}
{"text":"I have only ordered the pad thai and spring rolls from here for takeout, but all three times they were excellent. 1 order of pad thai and spring rolls was enough to share for two people."}
{"text":"We have been here before and the food has been good. Lately the service has slipped quite a bit. A couple of times there was no server, or the server was late for her shift, and the owner or cook (?) helped out.  On Dec 18 we came here to have lunch. The restaurant was open. There was nobody in the restaurant, nobody in the kitchen. We called and looked downstairs. We waited for about 5 minutes, nobody showed up, just another potential customer.  Nobody on the premises at 2pm on a Friday. It was strange and creepy. After this, we will not be back. 
Then we had lunch at the Schnitzel Place next door, and it was great! :-)"}
{"text":"First time at a Friendly Thai.   Four of us went there because the Junction  restaurant (Italian) we were heading for had a 20 minute wait.  We were really pleasantly surprised. Spotless environment, friendly service and delicious food - in ample quantities (everyone agreed).  Frankly by far the best chain Thai restaurant we have experienced.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"big fan of The Friendly Thai on Yonge so I thought I'd give this newest location a go - bonus that it's right in my 'hood. I know the chain for its low prices and big big piles of steaming noodles. not authentic by any means but for $8 I care not.

it was Friday night 8pm and the place was about half full but from the sounds of the telephone ringing off the hook, lots of people were getting takeaway. my friend and I seated ourselves and shared the menu that happened to be on the dirty table (all the free tables were dirty). 10 minutes later the harried waitress asked us if we want drinks. they were out of my first two beverage selections but we each eventually settled on a water and a juice.

another 15 minutes pass. our drinks arrive and the server finally clears the table of debris but we're still sharing one menu. when she comes back a while later my friend orders the red curry pad thai with chicken, and I just get some spring rolls. 

it's half an hour later and we're the only table left in the place. the server's been on the phone taking orders the whole time. all the empty tables are dirty and littered with empty plates. our food finally arrives and the pad thai is amazing, although my friend has to wait a while to try it because the server's too busy running around in the kitchen to bring us utensils. my spring rolls fall apart and I have to eat them like a salad. our drinks are long gone and so is our water and I have to go up to the counter to get more because dude it's thai food, that shit's spicy. 

while on the phone still, the server tells me she'll bring us our water \"in a minute\" and takes three more calls while we wait with burning mouths.

great cheap thai food but don't eat in, people."}
{"text":"Second time ordering take out from here given positive fb reviews in the community. Food is sub-par at best. Pad Thai looks and tastes like goop with no flavour. Won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! The food is incredible, the atmosphere is cozy and the servers are so nice. I'd suggest the Curry Pad Thai, coconut rice or the Chicken with Peanut Sauce (my fav!)"}
{"text":"Saturday 6.08pm ordered, 7.53pm delivered! If the food hadn't been cold it might have been good! Driver said they have only two drivers and he just picked up the food a couple of minutes ago - I had called twice to check if food was on it's way... Dissatisfying and very disappointing!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once but my experience was great. I had curry phad thai and it was delicious, very flavourful. The server was very friendly and checked up on me a few times. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for lunch and the food was good. Wait staff is slow ad not very attentive. Only one others table in the place and it took quite some time to be greeted. It's usually like this. I went for dinner with my boyfriend and ordered my usual peanut avocado stir fri and he ordered curry pad Thai. Regular pad Thai came to the table. It looked like the sauce was pure catchup and had been sitting in the kitchen for awhile. We sent it back, but the waitress made a big deal about it. When it came back out it looked like the same food had been tossed with some curry powder. Curried catchup...yuck!"}
{"text":"i ordered the spicy noodles with beef, wasn't spicy and was tasteless the beef was extremely dry and chewy, the spring rolls were good but the main was awful."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered for the first time on Sunday. We tried the Thai mushroom soup, veggie spring rolls, veggie green curry and spicy beef. The woman who took my order was kind and efficient. She offered us free mango chicken with our order... Um, okay!  The food arrived just as ordered and was by far better than many other Thai places I've tried off the Danforth. I found the entrees a bit too sweet but will gladly be ordering Thai here again and again.  For 45 bucks, I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout for the family on a Friday night. Food was ready for pickup on time and the portions are large. But, it's uninteresting food - won't be going back. 

Got a red curry with coconut rice - very thick and waaaaaaay too sweet. That's really the only flavour present - coconut and sugar. No ginger, no curry, nothing but sugary sweetness. 

Also got lychee tofu (okay), Pad-See Eww (okay), and glass noodles (vege) - probably the best dish of everything.  Oh, and two small sticks of chicken satay (for $6 - ripoff).

The food was no better than a very average mall food-court - not memorable, absolutely no reason to go back. 

This place has been good at times, but given the extremely average meals we've had the last times we've been there, it's now off our list."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with a group - we made a reservation for 14, but the group ended up being larger than that - 21 in total. I've never given a restaurant a 1-star review, but I've also never had a worse experience at a restaurant in this city.

We were seated quickly, but some of our group was left outside - the restaurant was full. The seating we were given was spaced throughout the restaurant, even for our initial group of 14 (we were on time for our reservation). The rest of the group was eventually seated without issue.

Our drink order wasn't completely filled. We had asked for a round of water and a few beers and glasses of wine. The water never arrived, even an hour after ordering it. One of the glasses of wine was incorrect. The beers were fine. Asking for more water was the same story.

We made our food order at the same time as our drink order. However, it took over an hour to deliver the first dish - and one of the dishes - mine - never came, even after everybody at my table had finished their meals. After finding the owner of the restaurant and telling him that I still hadn't been served (pineapple chicken fried rice), the food still took another 30 minutes to come out of the kitchen. Several of the other dishes that were served were served cold. Other than the fact that it was cold and took far too long to be finished, the food was fine.

One of the waitresses - not the one serving our table - quit mid-shift and ran out through the front door. Of the other waitresses that were there that night, only one of them was properly trained.

Initially, after complaining, the owner offered me an offensive 10% discount on my meal and drink, but he eventually relented and gave a 100% discount. Not once did he apologize for his restaurant's inability to handle the increased demand.

I still tipped the waitress because I felt bad for her. The management can be blamed for this situation - not enough staff (trained or otherwise), poor kitchen organization, and poor service - are all a result of the management's inability to predict staffing levels for a night that they know they'll be receiving a large group.

Our group won't be coming back to this restaurant, which might be good for them, because the way that they handled tonight's increased seating tells me that they aren't able to handle a full house properly anyway."}
{"text":"Caution: This Veggie Dinner for Two may include bites of an offensive nature. Eater discretion is advised."}
{"text":"We went by for a simple dinner of mango salad, basil tofu and red curry. The food is unimaginative but quite cheap. I can see why it would be somewhat popular especially if you happened to be a mouse. Quite the after dinner event to see a mouse scuttling through the establishment. We tried to discuss with this with the manager but were rebuffed quite rudely. Less friendly Thai for humans, more friendly to rodents"}
{"text":"Worst. Thai. Ever.

A dead giveaway should have been that the side salad came with French dressing, but the place looked nice and they had a lunch special...

Perhaps had my friend and I not been to Thailand and had super yummy food there, or even had I not had the most delectable Sukhothai (on Parliament) we wouldn't be so quick to judge. But come on. FRENCH DRESSING!? Not even a house vinaigrette that tried to be faux-Asian of some sort?

For a while now, Ive heard tell of Toronto's really bad Thai scene, of Pad Thai made with ketchup, but I thought, no, surely it's just sarcasm. Ladies and Gents, after today, I can attest that this is no myth. It was, in a word, awful. 

Never going back."}
{"text":"Here's when you go to The Friendly Thai:

a) you're somewhere around Bloor, and you don't want to walk \"all the way\" to Dundas for Salad King (cause you're too hungry or lazy)
b) you've already eaten at Salad King three times this week and you live pretty much across the street from Friendly Thai anyway
c) you play the \"ok, we're going to eat at the next restaurant that appears on our left\" game, and Friendly Thai ends up being that place because you're too far away from Salad King.

Ok, so the place is cute and the food is tasty, but really? Not worth a trek; each entree runs about 10-12 bucks and you have to buy rice too. I will say the coconut rice is dang tasty, though. Man, I'd eat that and a mango salad and be a happy camper. I've had the avocado peanut stir fry a couple times - once it was great, once it was clumpy and the avo wasn't ripe enough. My friend had green curry and it was lovely... and the portions are quite large - if you have a girly appetite, you'll definitely come away with tomorrow's lunch. 

In conclusion: don't make a special trip, but if you're in the neighbourhood and craving some thai, give'r a go."}
{"text":"MY REVISIT AFTER A YEAR OUT OF THE COUNTRY

What an utter disappointment.  I had noticed in the past that on any given day the food was either great or just average depending on either what chef was on or if it was his time of the month.  Well now I can say that it is without doubt one of the worst places I have ever been to food wise.  Hire a real chef PLEASE.  One that has pride in his work.... even training.  Huh?

A curry is not supposed to be thinner than water - it dilutes the taste. I needed to throw my avocado a rubber ducky it was drowning... but it was too late.... there was nothing I could do.

Stick with the starters and you will be fine but seriously, hire the old chef back or at least buy a little corn flour or something.

This place used to be one of my favourites but its' custom will surely be making their long trek (about 10 yards) up the road to the other Thai Restaurant.... I know I will.

I used to love this place... snif"}
{"text":"Friendly Thai just delivered the best Thai takeout in Toronto to me door. This place is always consistently good, but this time was amazing!"}
{"text":"I called to place and order and was told that my order didn't meet the delivery minimum. Their website says very clearly that the delivery is free with a minimum order of $15. She explained to me that \"prices are subject to change\". Food prices and delivery costs are 2 different things.  Also, my order was a whopping .50 short of their unpublished delivery minimum. You would think that since the website is inaccurate an exception could be made, but I guess they're doing such a brisk business that they can turn down customers. Will never order from Friendly Thai again."}
{"text":"Food: 3 
Service: 4
Ambiance: 4
Overall: 3.5

I really wanted to like this place, I did. I'm not sure what other people's experience of \"Thai\" food is according to other reviews but this is not authentic Thai food. This is as authentic Thai as much as imitation crab is authentic crab. The food, while not horrible, is lacking so much of what makes Thai food what it is. The sign of a good Thai place is how well they do their Pad Thai (well at least for me it is). As another reviewer mentioned, their pad thai is a clump of noodles with all the wrong flavours. Sadly enough, this is the kind of Pad Thai most people are used to. Seriously though, just watch a few youtube videos of Pad Thai being made in the streets of Thailand and tell me that you still think that orange/neon/glow-in-the-dark Pad Thai that is served here in Toronto is legit.

Well enough ranting from me. My friends love this place and so do many others. These are the same friends who love Manchu-Wok when they crave Chinese food. Chacun à son goût! :)"}
{"text":"I generally enjoy eating at this place despite being somewhat unpredictable on quality. The decor is minimal, ambiance is relaxed and service is friendly - quite similar to other Friendly Thai restaurants in the city. 

Overall, it's just another (slightly expensive - I would take a toonie off each main dish) Thai restaurant; nothing distinctive to write home about."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!  I can't believe that after getting the order wrong, the new employee (Maria) was trying to tell me (a vegan and vegetarian person) that I placed the order wrong.  The manager should teach their employees that customer service is #1.  When I finally arrived there to get my  refund, Maria kept on arguing with me claiming that WE had incorrectly placed the order instead of attempting to make amends in an effort to keep me as a customer.  This place will be closed within a short time especially with employees like Maria."}
{"text":"Will never order from there awful! !!!! Pad thai was disgusting the shrimps had a molded taste!!!!! Beef skewers was ground Pakistani taste meat!!!!! My tummy hurt all night"}
{"text":"My favorite Friendly Thai location. Not a huge fan of Thai food but this place sure beats Spring Rolls and any other Thai place I've been to so far..."}
{"text":"This restaurant is by far the worst restaurant I have encountered, please avoid. 

I ordered takeout from this restaurant since they left flyers in my mailbox and of course, my other neighbours, I thought, hey, why not try it( regretted it so much!)

I ordered chicken fried rice and curry pad thai. They would charge you different price from the menu(not much, 1 dollar or so). If you realize it, the waitress that has a nice voice would give you different excuses. She would say, hey, you have the wrong menu. But if you ask her to provide the right menu, she would say no problem, and then give you the exact same menu that you have. I thought the girl just made a mistake at first, now I know some people are born evil....

As for the food, how dare they charge 10.99 for chicken fried rice, it's dried and not fresh. The pad thai is really wet, the quantity is big, quality, on the other hand, is not so good. Also, I seriously doubt if they have a clean kitchen...I had hair in my pad thai...I will never buy any food from this restaurant...and I think the restaurant owner should seriously consider changing the waitress over the phone...she is evil....."}
{"text":"Service has been a bummer here lately(less waiters), but the food definitely makes up for it 100%! I'm always craving the thai chicken avocado! And probably can eat it everyday! So yummy!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery for the first time from these guys. Red curry beef, spring rolls and jasmine rice. When I unpacked the food I looked at my red curry beef dish and didn't see any beef. 

Upon further close inspection I found exactly three tiny bits of beef in the entire $14 dish. To make matters worse the beef was tough and chewy. Like rubber and the diced bell peppers in the dish weren't even cooked. I called the restaurant and asked for my money back. The owner drove back and dropped off the money for the dish but not the rest of the meal which was now ruined. 

The place is owned and operated by Sri Lankans. Not that there is anything wrong with that but if you are looking for authentic or even good Thai food then this isn't the place."}
{"text":"Qualifiers: I ordered from Just-Eat and I don't eat meat or seafood.

I was genuinely surprised by the reviews this place has been getting, because my experience has been pretty good so far. The portion sizes are quite large for the price and the food was good. Obviously not authentic, but still delicious enough to entice me to order again. I actually enjoyed the spring rolls and the crispy tofu appetizers. The green curry was also delicious.

I'm not an expert or even remotely knowledgable when it comes to thai food, so my taste buds aren't accustomed to awesome authentic thai deliciousness. This food was good enough for me, as a person who has no real base of comparison. Some of these reviews have motivated me to try what else is out there.

The only thing I wish, really, was that the minimum delivery on Just-Eat was a little bit less (currently it's 35 dollars). This is a small qualm."}
{"text":"Really good curry chicken pad Thai! Food was hot when it was delivered and came quickly! Great portions, no concerns with orders. Have yet to have any complaints so giving this place 5 stars!"}
{"text":"An unexpected pleasure.  Very tasty, great value."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good, given the hugely uninspiring name and appearance of this place. We had the shrimp red curry (containing exactly five shrimp) and coconut rice (rich, creamy and sweet), which together was not quite enough for two. I wouldn't rush back here given the relatively high prices, but it was a good quick fix.

Service was a bit slow, even though we were one of two groups in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I got takeout from this location. The food was rubbery and lacked taste. So disappointing."}
{"text":"My partner and I come here pretty regularly since she lives in the neighborhood. As mentioned in other reviews, the food here is nothing especially amazing but it does have a decent atmosphere and generous portions. Definitely not somewhere worth trekking to but if you're nearby, it's a reasonable option."}
{"text":"This was my first Thai food experience in Toronto, and I have to say it was the worse Thai food ever! 
I would highly recommend NOT going here. Bad Food and service."}
{"text":"i really hate to give one star, but \"i've had better\" doesn't express  that i only ate some because i was desperately hungry and eager to keep shopping, and i left more than two thirds of the mountain of grub on my plate.   i would say it was barely edible, and i was a little worried that it would make me feel sick later.  but it only repeated on me a little.

the egg roll was greasy and had a chemical aftertaste.  it was soggy inside and looked refried.   the salad was nice, and the vegetables seemed fresh enough, nice dressing.   the pad thai was wet and sticky, and the vegetables were mangled, and grey. and frantically hot like something that was microwaved.  the tofu was good.

the service was very good.  so i gave a decent tip, but then 13 dollars for a dozen mouthfuls of soggy goop was just too much."}
{"text":"The delivery was quick and the curry was good. But I ordered veggie fried rice with no eggs and even the description of the item didn't say egg.  I can't eat eggs and didn't notice it was in there and I got sick. I emailed the restaurant to let them know and never got a response back.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Whatt this place doesn't exist anymore! Too bad, I Will miss the mango salad and coconut chicken soup."}
{"text":"We ordered from here today and the delivery was lightening speed, the food was piping hot, the service was great, the food was also delicious. I'm so glad to have this place close by so that I can order more frequently."}
{"text":"Ordered take out from the friendly Thai. The sauce was good and veggies were flavourful, however I made the mistake of choosing beef with my curry. I usually go with chicken or shrimp, and I definitely should have strict with my usual meat option. The beef was hard and a bit chewy. It didn't really go well with the green curry, unfortunately. Next time, I will order beef with either yellow curry or red curry. Otherwise, the dish was a decent portion and came with a side of rice. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not too impressed with The Friendly Thai lately. They changed one of their deals of getting a free mango chicken when ordering over $35 to $40 and they have not updated their brochures/menus to reflect this.

Delivery has been taking longer and longer. The driver did not have change so I had to call In and give my credit card number. 

The straw that broke the camel's back was finding several big pieces of paper towel in the vegetable dish we ordered. We discovered these by trying to chew these thinking they were pieces of cabbage.  That really grossed us out. Not just one piece but several pieces. 

My last order from here will be my last time ever as I have found a better place for Thai delivery with better quality and deals."}
{"text":"Went here because of a Dealicious promotion and was surprised at just how bad it was.  I know my Thai Food, since I used to work at a Thai Restaurant and I've been to Thailand.  The Tom Yum soup had the most bitter aftertaste and after a few spoon fulls I was unable to continue with that.  The vegetarian appetizer platter came out and the tofu pieces were okay, but there was no dips or sauces offered for any of the items. Then the Curry came.  There was something strange about its texture, as it was way too think and not the color I usually see.   We tried one more time for dessert, my wife ordered the sticky rice and it was a total disatser.  It was mushy and didn't have much flavor.   The portion sizes were very large, but since we couldn't stomach them, we got everything to go and gave it away to the homeless people that often are found at Bathurst & Queen St.  Hope they enjoyed it, because I couldn't.  I dont' see any other reviews about this place, so maybe someone can share a better experience or confirm my views.   But right now, I can't even think about going back to give it another try..."}
{"text":"If I could give minus stars I would. Disgusting pad Thai, I'm not sure how to even describe it except for pools of lime-flavoured brown grease, wayyy too much tofu. Spring rolls were greasy and came without any sauce. I've tried it twice now - each time thinking \"how bad can it be?\" - and it should be closed down. Bonus points for the gal behind the bar wiping her runny nose on the back of her hand."}
{"text":"It's a rainy Saturday night and it has now been 1h50 minutes since we ordered through the restaurant's website. I've now called 3 times and have not yet received a good answer about where our food is and if it coming. Clearly others have had problems too. Steer clear - lots of other great options."}
{"text":"I get take out from here regularly simply because its close by to where i live.  I find it better than Thai Spicy House. It's not the cheapest place, but is competitive with the neighbourhood so I suppose prices are fair.  

Never really had a problem with service, though sometimes its a bit slow (they tell me 15 minutes and I have to wait awhile when i get there 15 minutes later)."}
{"text":"Overall, a mediocre Thai restaurant, with a few bright spots.

Atmosphere: Kitschy, tacky decor. I sat right next to/facing the window, so I could look out at the street rather than at the odd, out of place seeming oil paintings and random lights. Service, however, is really pleasant. My waitress was extremely friendly and attentive.

Food: The food is... just okay, with one shining exception: the Med Ma-Muang Phad Pak: basically vegetables in a creamy coconut sauce, topped with cashews. It was really, really good, and the only thing I would go out of my way to eat again. Perfect balance of spice with the creamy coconut- delicious! I also tried tofu fried with lychees, cold rolls (classic and vegetarian), spring rolls, and the pad thai. Nothing but the coconut cashew vegetable dish was memorable. I should add that a friend of mine really enjoyed her coconut rice dish (apparently this place does coconut well)."}
{"text":"So, it's 9:30 pm and you are hungry while walking around Yonge and Bloor.  A lot of places are closing and you are starving.

You walk south past the Friendly Thai searching for food... 
After realizing there is only questionable fast food joints and sex shops, you turn around and go back, not being in the mood for cafeteria sushi or constricting leather.

At the Friendly Thai, the menu is large and they do have tasty drinks.... and $3.00 beer.

They have dinner specials under $10, which aren't too bad.
Coconut rice is good.
They also have fried bananas which are always fun.
Server was super friendly."}
{"text":"we ordered from here after my boyfriend got hit by a car. we really just wanted a nice, easy afternoon after this tragic event, and went on just-eat to check out what was nearby. we both felt like having some thai, and this place came up as the top-rated thai place. 

people who rated this place favourably must have no semblance of what good thai food should taste like. after tasting the food from here, we have concluded that they must be total philistines. 

we got the dinner for two, and the curry was totally tasteless and dry. it was overly viscous and was basically like they boiled coconut cream for like 2 hours and added some instant flavouring to it before serving it. the pad thai was also overly dry and the chicken literally tasted like paper towels. 

the driver, however, was very nice, and expressed grave concern for my injured boyfriend. he even helped bring the food up the stairs. 

for the chefs, however, we cannot express the same admiration.

don't trust the boring people here who know nothing about thai food. we will definitely be eating mcdonalds before eating here again, and we don't eat mcdonalds because we're not masochists, so yeah. i felt like a masochist when i was trying to eat the food from this thai place.

for better thai food, go to sukhothai. (they're basically the only thai place worth going to, but are closed sundays.)"}
{"text":"I couldn't believe how bad it was. i had a vegetarian dish - i ended up throwing out 3/4 of my dish.  need i say more?"}
{"text":"Thai atmosphere a zero.  After being assured of \"fresh vegetables such as broccoli\" and chicken in my yellow curry with coconut milk, it arrived more like an almost empty soup!  All the chicken put together wouldn't have filled a teaspoon and very few vegetables with NO broccoli - mostly cut up potato, a starch that I don't eat. For the first time after a Thai meal out ever - and I eat Thai out a lot! - I left hungry and disappointed. Afterwards,  I felt very let-down and mentioned this to a friend, who said that she went there once and would never go back again."}
{"text":"Have been ordering from and eating at this restaurant for a few years, at least a couple of times a month,  and it's always been reasonably good with occasional lack lustre dishes and occasional very good dishes.

My last several orders and have been increasingly sub par and missing things like dipping sauces, chop sticks and side dishes (like rice) and my ordering from here has trailed off in the past few months.

Last night we tried again and this order was the final straw.

The Cold Spring Roll was almost entirely lettuce, with a few thin slices of carrots, peppers and tofu.  The little bit of  avocado was partially grey and very over-ripe. There was no dipping sauce or coriandor at all.

The AVOCADO PEANUT STIR-FRY was made from the same over-ripe avocado as the cold spring roll.  The veggies were definitely not fresh and the whole dish was swimming in a bland watery sauce.  The brown rice side was dry and crunchy, at least a day old.

The green curry was reasonable but entirely devoid of thai basil, so it was very tasteless.

To top it off, we both got minor poisoning.

I would avoid this rapidly deteriorating restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me and although the food lived up to expectations the service was truly terrible. As the only people in the retaurant we had to overhear the wait staff planning their weekend with their friends, and actually had to interrupt their phone conversation to add an item to our order. Although good food is important, this restaurant seems to take their customers for granted. I'll think twice before going here again."}
{"text":"This is more of a local restaurant, there's not a lot around here. The restaurant is relatively small and fits only a small quantity of people. The food isn't that good. I love Thai food and I've been here a few times and I was disappointed with my food each time. But the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"I'm surprised by some of the other reviews. I take out from here maybe once a month and I consistently go back because I'm always pleased. Green curry chicken and crispy beef with coconut rice. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I do agree with Steve on many aspects of his review although I would like to focus on the food quality as I always order takeout from here as opposed to dining in.  I would like to point out too, the slow service when dining in.

But since I order from here often, I can vouch that the food is consistently great, hot and without error in content.

Some random notes:
The basil beef, chicken and seafood is very good and generous.
The coconut rice is overly sweet.
The pad Thai is typically ketchupy which I kinda like.
The coconut mushroom soup is very good.
I like the cold rolls. Always fresh.
And if they're making the crispy beef (which they don't always do, but if they are, it's delicious) it is often over cooked so ask them to...well... not over cook it.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Friendly Thai is like that back up friend everyone has. You know the one, she/he is always in for that night out when everyone else is busy, and it's not quality time you spend together it's just time. But let's face it they're always there whether you like it or not.

Friendly Thai is my go to place, when I'm too tired to cook or feeling the need for a little dirty feed. They answer first ring, they are at the house in the allotted 30 to 45 minutes. The food is always hot and fresh and I love my free spring rolls. 

While their orders are always fresh they don't really do Thai to die for. I do have to sauce it up on my own. Our standard order is shrimp pad thai, green curry chicken, coconut rice, and free spring rolls all for the low price of $29.00. The pad thai lasts for three meals. So it is good enough for me. 

Bottom line...Friendly Thai is my take out McDonald's. Don't judge you know you have one too."}
{"text":"The food and service is incredible. My friend and I are both vegetarian and got the curry pad Thai, veggie pad Thai and spring rolls. We barely had to wait at all for our food!

Can't beat a 1/2 litre of red wine for $12 every day either.

I MUST ALSO MENTION! I forgot my purse on my seat and left the restaurant and walked down Roncy. I didn't realize until the server found me by running 4 blocks down the street to give it to me! A Roncesvalles Angel!"}
{"text":"Not the worst place, and if I had to go back, I wouldn't grumble about it.  We had their Pad Thai and a spring roll dish.  Nothing special at all.  Service for a lunch where there were only 2 tables... coulda been better.  Server is nice and all, but she kept singing all the songs that came on the radio when we wanted a quiet lunch.

Likely not coming back."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and was told it'd be \"about 45 minutes\" after an hour I had to call to inquire where my food was. Eventually it took almost an hour and a half to get to me. The food was on the closer side to warm than hot. The food was just ok, there is better tasting and valued thai food in the east end."}
{"text":"I went here for take out last night and there were a few indicators that the meal would be substandard. 
1.well, he did admit that it was his first day, he kept messing up at the cash register and they seemed unorganized.
2. i heard the other staff member on the phone with a customer saying \"the driver left already\" and assured the customer the food would be there soon (nb/don't order delivery if you want your food right away)
3.the waitress asked this couple how their food was and they both said it was a bit too salty. the waitress seemed very accommodating and said she'd let the cooks know.
4. i saw this one young guy pick up a giant piece of bok choy. i don't think he knew how to eat it and let's face it, bok choy isn't easy to chew apart.
my green vegetable curry was pretty bland. i had expected it to be salty but it was quite the opposite. one piece of cauliflower, lots of broccoli stems (i've heard they're the most nutritious part of broccoli but i would've preferred more of the top parts), baby carrots (like the kind you eat with hummus) and very few pieces of tofu.
maybe everyone was having a bad day but i think i'll have to keep up the search for a new favourite thai place in the leslieville hood!"}
{"text":"While the food is alright, the establishment habitually delivers orders incomplete and then gives epic attitude when you call them to rectify the situation even though you've paid for items you haven't received. 

There are plenty of other Thai restaurants that I can get good food from without getting ripped off. 

Bad move, Friendly Thai."}
{"text":"I had an extremely disappointing experience at the Friendly Thai on Queen St. I've been a regular customer eating in the restaurant a handful of times in the last few months and ordering take out from there frequently (more often than I'd like to admit).

I, being a creature of habit, always order the same vegetarian dish. 

A couple weeks ago I ordered the same dish for take out after getting back from a vacation, I went to go pick it up and made the trek home (okay, it was a ten minute walk but when you're hungry that feels FAR). 

I got my order home and it was wrong. It wasn't the same dish at all. The dish I've ordered countless times had a lighter coloured sauce, different vegetables and a side of peanut sauce served with it. I've ordered this dish AT LEAST 15 times. The sauce for this dish was sweeter (instead of saltier) so not just a different colour.

I called to complain and the woman answering the phone (the same one who took my order) began to argue with me. No peanut sauce comes with it. (I referred to the menu which actually mentions that it comes with peanut sauce). After she apologized for that she said it was a new chef but the same recipe (not even close to the same taste, I told her). After more back and forth she finally said she could make it again (No, I'm not going to walk all the way back there) OR give me a discount next time. WHY NOT GIVE ME A FREE MEAL NEXT TIME instead? I hung up on her when she refused to budge because I wasn't going to engage any longer. She had my number from placing my order but I never heard back from her.

And to add insult to injury, the discount they used to apply to pick up orders has changed making them slightly more expensive than the competitors on that block.

I understand mistakes happen, but due to her arguing with me and then not making it \"right\" I won't be returning to Friendly Thai. Instead I'll go to Sweet Lulu (always friendly and cheaper) or Thai Elephant."}
{"text":"Do you hate cilantro?  If yes, you'll understand my pain. If not, let me explain: when I eat cilantro it tastes like a tiny-elf foot is rotting in my cheeks.

I ordered off of this location through just-eat.ca.  All the user reviews were 5 stars, and the comments were gushing.   They have a deal now where if you ordered enough food, you get 20% off, so I figured I'd give it a shot.

I will give them this much: it's a lot of food.  That's about the only positive.

The pad thai wasn't bad, for bad-pad-thai standards.  The two appetizers, a crispy spring roll and then a fresh garden roll, were both awful.  I had requested in the comment section \"no cilantro\" (usually not an issue since cilantro is usually added to dishes at the end), but the fresh garden rolls, which were just some iceberg lettuces in a roll, were crawling with it.  I guess when you're only other ingredient is lettuce, you have to add in something to give it flavour.   Oodles of Noodles had oodles of salt, almost to the point of inedibility.  

I won't be ordering from here again, and I don't understand the user reviews.  Usually Just Eat users are pretty helpful."}
{"text":"I recently ordered delivery from here and I preferred it to its sister location on Queen.
Delivery was prompt, portions were generous and the chicken Phad Thai was delicious.  One caveat emptor: I ordered a new dish \"Devil Beef\" which I was told over the phone was a \"little bit spicy\". 
Don't get me wrong, it was really tasty, but it was pretty hot. Crispy strips of beef & veg in a sweetish-sauce loaded with sweat-inducing chilies. 
It was a \"little\" spicy in the same way that a Peter Jackson film runs a \"little bit long,\" or the CN Tower is a \"little\" overpriced for a glorified elevator ride.
I will definitely order from here again, but I will request my food to be a \"little\" mild-to-medium next time."}
{"text":"Not my favourite Thai restaurant, but it's in the area and not terrible. The soups are good and the glass noodles were okay."}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to this location almost a year ago. I have been to other Friendly Thai locations but this one is the best!!!

I mainly get the Coconut Chicken Soup, Coconut rice, and the Spring rolls. The food is always fresh, piping hot and tasty. I like to put some of my Coconut rice into the soup. I have also had their Pad Thai with chicken there which is really yummy. 

The one thing that I find really interesting about this location is the their Coconut Chicken soup is the best out of the 3 locations I have been to. I have asked the other locations and this location and they say they should all be making it the same way. I find it's not too spicy, I like the mushrooms they use and the chicken is not rubbery from being boiled too long. 

I was there around lunch time so it was a bit busier but I found the service to be prompt as usual. The servers are always polite and chatty if there is the opportunity to chat. The restaurant is trendy with its clean lines in design. As well it is hygienically clean both in the restaurant and downstairs in the bathroom."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's one of my favourite Thai places in the city for sure.

The staff is super friendly and helpful. They're awesome in terms of correcting problems with your order. 

The red curry is one of the best I've had, I love it. It could be a tiny bit spicier, but it's probably my fault for not asking for this.  The green mango salad is to die for! Perfect in every way (I'm eating it right now actually!).  Perfect amount of each ingredient.

The only complaint I'd have is that three times when I ordered the Friendly Thai Meal, they forgot my mango juice! This is a problem, I now always call or indicate on my online order to include the juice, as it's included in the price. It's a tad annoying, but the food and service make this a super small inconvenience.

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"So far I have never been disappointed with the food here. I love my Coconut Chicken soup and my Pad Thai. I have tried a few other dishes here as well. The staff are usually very friendly."}
{"text":"It was a quiet snowy Saturday. Just me for a bit then a couple came in. Nice server who was pleasant but not overly chatty.

Food was great! Coconut chicken soup, coconut rice and green curry chicken. 

It's a clean a spacious location. Wheelchair accessible right to the bathroom. If I'm in the Junction again I would most definitely return."}
{"text":"A welcome addition to the Davisville/Mt Pleasant restaurant scene, even if it is just a few doors south of another good Thai joint, Thai Spicy House. The upside of that is both places are hotly competitive, with discounts and house specials aplenty.

My wife and I have been to The Friendly Thai several times, and have been impressed with the food on every occasion. The portions are plentiful and faithful to original recipes, while the service is attentive and pleasant, as the name of the road would indicate. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The previous reviewer was dead on. The following is exactly what happened to me last night: \"you play the \"ok, we're going to eat at the next restaurant that appears on our left\" game, and Friendly Thai ends up being that place because you're too far away from Salad King.\"

Too true.  My pale, tasteless-but-somehow-sweet pad thai came without lime or cilantro - only a few lusterless slivers of green onion, a little grouping of bean sprouts, and a stingy teaspoon of peanuts.  I squeezed every drop out of the lime wedge from my water glass, and it still didn't taste like much.  Maybe they didn't use enough ketchup?  More lime was cheerfully brought, but it still didn't taste like pad thai. I'm not sure a tamarind was in the area code while the noodles were being prepared.

My husband's green curry was better, but not great.

It's too bad.  It's a fun place.  I liked the crowd and the casual feel, and our server was helpful, chill, and prompt.  I loved that she was waiting tables in a lumberjack shirt and cutoffs with tights underneath.  Unfortunately, the food will keep me away."}
{"text":"I got the basil tofu and it was amazing. I requested it to be made with a different type of tofu, which the waitress referred to as \"the bigger pieces that are slightly browned.\" The tofu was firm with a nice chewy texture. I had never had tofu like that before, but I must say I loved it!

My boyfriend got the Pad Thai with Chicken which he also enjoyed.

The waitress was super friendly and kept our water glasses filled."}
{"text":"I don't really know where to begin with this review.

Food: 3/5. Pretty bland, no real taste, nothing \"authentically Thai\" about it AT ALL. However, if your taste-buds love Thai Express, Manchu Wok, etc. then this place could be just enough to get you by.

Atmosphere: 2/5. There's probably like 10 flies in this restaurant constantly flying around. How are you suppose to eat when there's flies constantly swarming around your dining area? I suggest the restaurant get some sort of bug exterminator or invest in a bottle of bug spray and really try to get rid of the pests.
Also, the air circulation... is non-existent in this restaurant. It is probably the most humid, stuffy, restaurant I've ever eaten in. 
The air circulation, in fact, was so terrible, I ordered the check 10 minutes into my meal just so I could pay and get the heck out of there. 

Service: 3.5/5. Service is pretty much the only thing that could potentially boost up the rating of this review. There's not much to say about it though. Wasn't horrible, but wasn't great either.

Overall conclusion - If I really wanted Thai food in The Junction, I would give this place another try. However, never would I ever I allow myself to dine-in here again."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery... took an hour and forty five minutes to arrive and was cold by the time we got it. Not that it mattered, nothing tasted fresh, my red currry chicken only had two (small) pieces of chicken and consisted mostly of bambo, I'm a human being not a panda bear. Pad thai tasted like ketchup, was slimy yet the vegetables were dried out. 

Springs roll soggy and strangely tasted like barbecue sauce? check. \"Vegetarian\" Pad Thai had eggs? check.

Won't be back."}
{"text":"This is not Thai food. Mango salad should not come with sweet ripe mango, but green mango. Awful service, awful Thai food. If you dont like spicy food and like lots of sugar this is the place for you. Very bland.The cook does not seem to know how to make Thai food.

The service was awful. We had to actually stand up and wave the server over. One time my dinner partner had to get up and go over to the servers to ask for something. They were more interetsed in the conversation they were having than serving the 2 tables in the place.

Better re-named from 'The Friendly Thai' to the 'The Not So Thai'"}
{"text":"Last night was the second time I did delivery from this place. And I will never be ordering from this business again.

The first time the delivery room twice as long as I was told and they didn't give me the rice I had ordered or a salad that was supposed to come with my dish. I didn't bother calling. Mistakes happen.

This time, I called and ordered a hot chicken pad Thai, two normal chicken pad Thai and one Malaysian chicken curry.
During the call. I had said chicken pad Thai and the person taking my order asked if I wanted classic to which I said yes, not realizing that chicken and classic are different. Before hanging up I mentioned a shrimp allergy and that we didn't want shrimp in our order. The man said okay.

When the food was delivered, there was one pad Thai with shrimp, one without shrimp, and the hot one, also without shrimp. (Again there was missing salad for the curry but we got free spring rolls and samosas).
We let the delivery guy know about the shrimp issue. He called the restaurant. The man was the same one I spoke to earlier. He did not seem to want to change  the order but eventually said the driver had another chicken pad Thai in the car and would change it for us.

The delivery guy came back with what looked like a new box. My boyfriend, who is deathly allergic to shellfish like shrimp started eating. Only to realize there was shrimp in his container. At which point mayhem erupted in the apartment.

He called the restaurant to chew them out and have our order refunded. The man (same one I spoke to earlier) did not want to speak to him but to me instead. When we spoke this time, the man did not want to refund the order. Legit he said that we both made mistakes with the ordering and delivery of the food, that mistakes happen and it's not nice to ask for a refund.

ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!! After being told in the order call about an allergy, and then being called and told again that a mistake happened and there is an allergy, you seriously want to fight on giving a refund for almost killing someone?? My boyfriend was lucky not to have a severe reaction because he saw the shrimp and immediately stopped eating and attempted to counteract the reaction. But what if he hadn't noticed and ate the shrimp? Or even just continued to eat the food that touched the shrimp? For a business to automatically not offer to refund and do everything in their power to rectify the situation is beyond ridiculous. To try to dissuade me from demanding for one after such a serious situation occurred is just disgusting. I wish I could give this business negative stars. Mistakes are not giving you the extra rice you ordered. Not serving someone food that kills them."}
{"text":"The food here is consistently good.  The deep fried tofu and peanut sauce is so good, and their coconut rice is addictive.  The sad thing is we order the same thing EVERY time!

If you order take out, you end up with larger portions than eating in.  The containers are bigger and they fill them."}
{"text":"Definitely not a fan of this place. Whether you order the pad Thai or a curry dish, each time you go back it will taste nothing like it did in the past. The consistency of the food is certainly lacking.  Additionally, any meat dishes that we have ordered, red curry chicken, had about 1oz of meat protein..."}
{"text":"Went in and waited 10 min. Nobody came out to seat us. We left. 
The decor inside the restaurant is too messy. The place looks dusty too."}
{"text":"Small, quaint Thai restaurant located near the intersection of Yonge and Isabella streets, this restaurant offers great food and service at affordable prices. It doesn't really stick out from other Thai eateries in the area in any other aspect and their location on Yonge Street really hides it among the many shops that line up Toronto's busiest street. Being on such a street adds to its anonymity, but it also takes away points as most Thai eateries that I have enjoyed dining at are located on smaller residential or commercial streets where people viewing is common (such as Just Thai on Church Street and Pi Tom on Alexander Street).  Food and service are both decent."}
{"text":"So cute, the name and the server. 

The food was pretty good.  They didn't really have as complete a Thai menu as I come to expect but I still enjoyed my noodles."}
{"text":"I'll be short and to the point. Don't be fooled by the nice looking interior. The food here is of a very low quality. You know what isn't in green thai curry in Thailand? Broccoli.
Tom Yum soup? like it came out of a can and added hot water. With 4 mushroom and overboilded shrimp. Pad thai was actually the worst of the three.
Only ate there cause Thai Chef had a 1.45 minute wait for delivery. Get your food from there. It's 1000x better than this place. Which is terrible."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is definitely not as bad as everyone is making it out to be. I don't eat meat or seafood, so maybe that's the issue. This certainly isn't my favourite thai place in the city but it's open late, cheap, and close. It's not authentic but it's a Friendly Thai chain, so what were you expecting?

The veggie green thai curry is pretty good. I'm also a fan of the Malaysian vegetable tofu curry. I'd say this place is equally comparable in food standards to the Thai Green Chili that's a few blocks west. It's almost always empty and the business seems to sustain itself through take-out, just like the other place. 

If you want to quiet meal, this is a safe bet. I'm not a fan of the decor. It feels cold inside with lots of glass and stone. Same mistake made by Cafe 668. It's not that pleasant to sit inside of, especially during the winter. Although at Cafe 668, it actually is just cold in there. There's also a big tv and bar.

The one time we did eat in, the service was not great. We were ignored after being given menus for a long time, because the only front of house staff was taking orders over the phone and just generally kept her back to us. This was more than a year ago though and I'm sure she's not there anymore. Much like a lot of these places, I'm sure the people in the kitchen are not Thai. In my experience they tend to be Sri Lankan but they don't produce bad food."}
{"text":"Just ordered the Thai spicy noodle and they weren't lying. It is really spicy. I usually order spicy since I have a high tolerance for the stuff but this is very spicy. So just beware. When they say spicy, they mean spicy. The overall taste isn't bad. I wouldn't say it's the best I've had."}
{"text":"For starters the service&experience, was lousy. I ordered the pho pia tod(Chicken spring roll),I however received the pho pia phak(vegetarian spring roll) the difference price wise it is only a dollar so that isn't the real problem, in my eyes the issue lies in the fact that either a)the server didn't understand english enough to take my order, in which case the menu should only be in Thai. Or B)She understood the order but failed to inform me that the kitchen was out. Secondly the server kept on telling us 5 more minutes every time we asked about the estimated time, for our foods arrival. I used the stop watch on my phone to time the arrival, hitting lap every 5 minutes. The meal took 15 minutes to come. Again the issue isn't the amount of time the meal took to come rather the fact the server kept on stalling. As for the meal(s), the ginger beef was soupy as per the usual, and like most people I like to freely put my food in my mouth, I usually expect to find only ingredients from the menu in my food. In this batch I found a weird tasting Onion like clove."}
{"text":"It was I picked up an order to go. The red curry chicken was amazing, deserving of over 5 stars if that where possible. The ginger beef was good but the ginger was cut a bit thick. I opted for the coconut rice this time, it is amazing and full of flavour, it beats the normal steamed rice hands down. That is if you like sweet food, it mixes very well with the flavour from the curry chicken and quite pleasantly with the sauce from the ginger beef. I also got 2 amazing spring rolls(free with any order over $20.00)"}
{"text":"This place served what was literally the worst thai food I have ever had in my entire life. I mean that. I am not exaggerating. We ordered three main course dishes and one soup, and without exception they were all awful. The flavouring was bland bordering on insipid, but what was worse was that the sea food smelt off. The fish smelt so bad that I ended up throwing my entire plate-ful food into the rubbish (we ordered take-out). I would not recommend this place at all. If you want good Thai food, go to Khao San Road- it's worth the trip downtown."}
{"text":"If I could make this 0 stars I would. This food is TERRIBLE!! The spring rolls are so greasy and the dipping sauce tastes like pure sugar. The pad thai has almost no flavor except for ketchup. I was really hopeful that this would be good because they talk about using tamarind in the sauce. It wasn't to be. The green curry chicken was the strangest thing I've ever eaten in my life. It was almost like they forgot to add any fish sauce and instead poured in some cream. I've never had Thai food that is so under seasoned and boring. Sorry Friendly Thai, I won't be ordering from you again!!"}
{"text":"I am never disappointed with this place. One of the best Thai places in town, that is for sure.

Always fresh, huge portions, interesting twists on traditional Thai staples, like the curried chicken pad thai.

The delivery was only 45 minutes of the quote 60 minutes.

If you are in the area, the eat in area is real clean, modern, cozy."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my son and we were both very happy.  Had the oodles of noodles and it had just the right amount of spice.  Loved the chicken and tofu combo, you usually only get a choice of one or the other, but here they give you both.  My son had the pad thai and it rocked.  Very clean, nice decor.  Prices reasonable."}
{"text":"I don't know if they changed management or something lately but a restaurant I used to love ordering from has messed up my order consistently the last few times. Most recently, I ordered delivery and told them I needed a card reader. They sent the driver without it. He insisted that I get in his car and drive to an ATM. No. Called the restaurant and they resolved it (paid), but my partners order was wrong.
Prior to this he found a plastic tag in his food. We called to complain and got met with indifference.
I don't think we'll be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Great meal.  Large portions, Quick service and reasonably priced.  I had the crispy beef and it was great.  They looked very busy with lots of order pick ups so looks like a popular place."}
{"text":"Mediocre food.  There are better Thai restaurants around for this price point. I found the Tom yum soup too sweet and not authentic tasting. Nice place and friendly staff."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice, when sort of desperate and not wanting pizza. Curry is a bit bland, what can you really do to white rice, and mango salad is really, really sweet. Had to get an extra plate to drain the syrupy liquid off. I love mango, but this is not green mango. Reminded me of those cans of mandarin oranges in my childhood.

Both times the service was dreadful. Staff had a great time talking to each other, and drifted by our table the absolute minimum they could. Had to ask for another fork, had salad then we weren't given new plates when she brought our second round of food. Had to ask, beckon, or walk to the back to get water, the check, etc. The first time we were not asked if we wanted any drinks, so we didn't bother to get our usual  beer.
BTW if you order online, make sure you are getting the right location. We went to pickup and found it our order was actually on Yonge south of Bloor. (Food there even worse-don't go there if sober, and unlike the Junction location, kinda dirty.)

Went to the Dundas West location last night. The Pad Thai was leaden and vinegary, stuck together and had to be cut with a knife to dish it out. We ordered Vegetables with Cashew Nuts; upon opening it at home it turned out to have no spice and NO nuts. So much for protein.

Finally, my daughter bit into the veggies and got what looks like a staple in her tooth. It actually hurt. I've taped the staple to our check and will probably take it back, but frankly, what are they going to do for me? I sure don't want a free meal, and consider myself lucky she caught it before wrecking a couple thousand dollars of orthodontic work."}
{"text":"I admittedly stopped ordering from one of the west end Friendly Thai locations after a few repeated disappointments and ball droppings... But here we are a good year and some time later and we stopped in to this location on a Saturday and were pleasantly satisfied with the experience. I would credit most to the restaurants casual but nice enough interior dining area, great service, and eating the food fresh out of the kitchen rather than delivery (freshness, portion size, and presentation all were wins of dining in).

The peanut sauce for the chicken satays was awesome. Note: dip spring rolls in it. Spring rolls are good but small. I had the Chicken Malaysian Curry and really enjoyed the flavour with just the right amount of spice (the kind you can still add some hot sauce to and not regret it). The wife had the Pad Woo Sen.

All in all, not my favourite thai food provider, but a safe choice if east of the DVP looking for thai food."}
{"text":"We stopped ordering from here after some really poorly cooked chicken wings, but I for some reason had a craving for their pad thai. I wasn't sure why, but for some reason I remembered it being really good.  The good news of the menu is the chicken wings aren't offered anymore, so I became a little more trusting.

This time around the pad thai was okay. Not as flavourful and a surprisingly high tofu to chicken ratio. But good enough that we ordered it again this weekend and it was even blander, with even more tofu!
We also ordered the Mango Chicken (okay but the mango pieces were very hard, perhaps either too uncooked or not ripe enough), and the Glass Noodles which were probably the saving grace to our order (no complaints, were actually pretty good).

One thing I also appreciate is when you order the Chicken Spring Rolls, its considerably bigger than the regular spring rolls. Some places make them the same size but swap some veggies out for the chicken. In this case they actually take a regular roll and add a fair amount of chicken to make some fatty spring rolls, definitely good value for the extra dollar in cost. I also really like the sauce they come with for dipping, has a sweeter almost honey-ish flavour than other thai joints offer.

Its still better than other places I've tried and the delivery has been relatively quick so I'll give it the 3 star average, but it'll probably be a good long time before I get the craving for this place again over the myriad of thai places in the city that deliver."}
{"text":"This place isn't good. I ordered pad Thai and rice. I wouldn't recommend this at all. The more I eat the more grossed out I get. Blah"}
{"text":"Okay, so this is just a quick note about a phone conversation I had with someone(female) at the Yonge & Bloor location at 2pm today. I was looking for a location that was closer to me at Yonge & Dundas. I can't use the internet at work, so I made a quick call as the Yonge & Bloor location is my usual so I had the # in my phone. I asked for the a phone for a closer location to Yonge & Dundas and the girl on the phone proceeded to tell me that they were right next to Yonge & Dundas and that she could see the square from where she was. Now I live downtown TO, I know that is complete bs.....she then amended by saying it is a 10 minute walk.....again...bs(unless ur a speed walker). Then when I told her that what she was saying was incorrect and to please not tell tourists that....she hung up the phone. Not good Customer Service at all."}
{"text":"This place is hit and miss. Last week we ordered the crispy beef and it was fresh and delicious. This evening we ordered the same dish and it was like eating leather. The beef tasted like it was made hours ago and  just heated and dressed with sauce. This is not the first time this has happened to us. We stopped ordering from them for a few months because of the same reason but thought we would give them another shot, well that was a wasted shell."}
{"text":"4 of us had dinner last night with 4 dishes and 2 rice for $55.  Great service, fresh, tasty food, very clean restaurant and really couldn't have asked for anything more. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Congratulations on compelling me to write my first negative review, The Friendly Thai. I usually check Yelp before ordering food from anywhere, but this time, I was lazy, hungry, and relied solely on the delivery app's built in restaurant ratings (a 9.7). Lesson learned. Never again. 

Where to start? The brown rice was completely obliterated. So much so, it resembled porridge. The Red Curry Beef (with chicken) lacked any chicken, which was probably a good thing, as the beef appeared to be surplus meat rations from a Soviet era MRE kit. We ordered one order of spring rolls, but were provided two, but no matter, they were toxic. I actually spat my first bite out. The green mango salad was just poorly sliced unripe pieces of mango. The \"authentic\" pad Thai was of the ketchup variety. So, not authentic. 

We ended up throwing the entire order out and making grilled cheese sandwiches. This was not only the worst Thai food we've ever had, but the worst food ever ordered from a restaurant. And for that, they get a star."}
{"text":"About two years ago, I came here for lunch with a friend who is a vegetarian so we ordered the vegetarian spring rolls as an appetizer and one main dish each. We asked the waitress to confirm that there is no meat in the spring rolls. When the spring rolls arrived to the table, my friend took a bite of the spring rolls and it looked like it could be either tofu or meat. We asked the waitress to confirm with the cook. When she came back to our table, she told us that usually that chef does not put meat in the spring rolls but today he did. The menu clearly states VEGETARIAN spring rolls and after clearly stating that, we still asked to confirm. The waitress was so certain that there is no meat that she did not bother to check with the chef before serving it. The cook then came out to our table to speak to us and he refused to take the spring rolls and my friend's main dish off the bill. My friend was furious as it is her religion to not eat meat. The cook did nothing to accommodate his mistake and was also extremely rude about the mistake he had made.

I wouldn't trust what else the cook puts in the food for as long as he remains the cook at this restaurant. Why would he decide to add chicken into the vegetarian spring rolls and charge as vegetarian spring rolls? I question the freshness and the cleanliness of this kitchen."}
{"text":"Don't do it. The \"famous\" mango salad is flavorless.  The chicken satay is mealy and bland. The dipping \"sauce\" is all chunks. The spring roll wasn't hot and the green salad is tinier and more pathetic than what you get from cheap sushi joints.

The only upside is friendly service."}
{"text":"I didn't see the reviews before I ordered there. I wish I had

Poor service. Had to ask several times for a basic item. Plus servers didn't know the Thai word for a dish. When I ordered \"Pad Kee Mao\" (written as such on the menu), they repeated, \"You mean the spicy noodles?\". No, I meant Pad Kee Mao. \"Oh I'm not sure what that is.\" Okay.

Everything was just kind of bland. Nothing terrible but nothing memorable either. Nothing to write home about.

Go if you're desperate, but your money is better spent elsewhere.

Plus, please turn off that loud Taylor Swift playing nonstop! It's a nicely decorated Thai restaurant, for goodness sake."}
{"text":"I went there a month ago to get a beef pad thai take-out. The waitress was very cute and friendly but the food wasn't that great. It was my first time there and I was pretty surprised at how bad the food turned out. I mean, it wasn't horrible, but it was okay either. The beef slices were really chewy and thick. The noodles was okay I guess, ketchupy as usual. But overall I think it was kind of bland. I had been wanting to give it a second try... but I'm kind of afraid that it'll turn out badly again. On the upside, they have all day delivery starting at 15$."}
{"text":"I don't go here anymore. It seems the place is always looking for staff and during our last visit we waited for 20 minutes and our drink order hadn't even been taken. Then a couple walked in and their order was taken immediately. Not impressed. I won't go back."}
{"text":"Place has gone way downhill in the past 6 months. My favorite dishes I no longer order, as they are greasy and bland where they were once fresh and bursting with flavor. Still have a couple things I like, spicy chicken fried rice and thai hot & sour soup are still good but I think it's time to finally look for a new thai place to get delivery from."}
{"text":"Ordered through UberEats. Order was cancelled 5 minutes after it was supposed to arrive (order was placed several hours in advance). Called and was told Uber had cancelled but the food was ready, so if i reordered they would send it immediately. Placed the same order again, called and was told food had been given to another customer so I would have to wait. Finally arrived 1 hour 12 minutes later, almost 2 hours after original order was supposed to arrive. Food was ok, but nothing special. I was offered 10$ credit on my next order for my inconvenience."}
{"text":"the pad thai is okay...the salad wasnt.....great place for a quick bite on the way to... wherever you need to go..... great place for students, the meals are filling, and its easy on the wallets.."}
{"text":"I loved our experience last night at the Friendly Thai. We were a bit reluctant to go in and sit down, but super glad we did. The service was amazing; very friendly and kind. Cozy atmosphere with tea light candles, too. The dishes we ordered (vegetarian) were all FULL of veggies - RARE for an ethnic fast-casual type of place. The cold rolls were by far some of the best I've had and were brimming with tons of colourful veggies. The veggie pad thai was not spicy, but fixed with a bit of Sirachi sauce. The mango salad and spring rolls were also a hit. The mango salad had delicious toasted cashews - and the portion size was HUGE (great for leftovers!)

Very happy we reluctantly tried Friendly Thai; we will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery. Food was delivered after 1.5 hours (and me having to call them of course). Finally we sit down for dinner, the order is wrong. Ordered vegetarian pineapple rice, beef noodles, coconut soup, cold rolls. Pineapple rice was not good. The beef noodles - they sent us tofu noddles which were okay. coconut soup was good. cold rolls are terrible and full of lettuce. Will called them back to say the order was wrong after waiting almost 2 hours for dinner to arrive. They did not offer suggestions to rectify the issue, just \"we are busy tonight\". Will not be ordering/returning- way too many thai places in toronto to have to deal with this kind of service."}
{"text":"Delicious! The plates are big, depending on how much you eat it is enough for two people. Ordered pad Thai glass noodles, vegetarian, and Malaysian chicken. I would go back there! Tasty..."}
{"text":"This place was okay. It's a Thai restaurant but plays jazz music. Their mango salad was good and so was their pad Thai but everything else was unmemorable."}
{"text":"I was in the neighbourhood and had a hankering for pad Thai. 
It was gross.
The vinegary-ness of the abundant sauce, nearly made me choke on my overcooked, broken noodles.
Bummer."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend stopped in this place cause we were starving on thanksgiving but couldn't eat a full meal so we decided to split some pad thia.......well it was alright. 

The decor in the restaurant are extremely tacky and out dated. Its really small and not very cozy. 

Our server was really nice though which was unexpected but the manager (or owner) was a complete dick. If you see him in there hes and older Indian guy, total douche. He was yelling at her in the restaurant and since its not big, the whole restaurant could hear him. Completely disrespectful. He was being a complete asshole to her and you could see that she was really frustrated with him. When we left we told her we though he was a douche and she laughed and smiled.... 

Just based on the way the employees are treated i would never go back there."}
{"text":"We had take out here today, and it was really good.  We've been looking for a good thai place in the neighbourhood...

We ordered Chicken with Peanut Sauce - (yum, not overly saucy), the portion size was good, and had some decent amount of vegetables.  We also had the Thai Avocado Chicken - super yummy, I've never seen this on a menu before, so we had to have it.  

The thai veggie spring rolls were great too.  We also had one order of steamed rice.

It was a good amount of food - more than enough for 2 people - 3 people and this amount of food would have been perfect.  Maybe next time!

Definitely a must try - PS.  I normally order green or golden curry, and after reading these reviews, I'm glad I didn't.  The 2 dishes we ordered were great, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I hate to give any place one star, and perhaps I should try The Friendly Thai again before coming down on the restaurant so hard, but I don't think I will go back.

The first thing that hit us when walking in was not the hideous decor (hideous in a non-campy way), it was the smell. The restaurant smelled a bit like a bathroom. I don't know why, but it was almost bad enough that we considered walking out before we ordered.

Speaking of which, despite being one of two tables of diners, it took ten minutes to get water and for the server to take our orders, then at least twenty minutes for the meal to come. The food was, well, it was not good. It was shiny and greasy and nothing tasted fresh. After lunch my stomach felt a little off, and it felt that way for quite a while. Lunch was about $12 each including tip and water.

Back to the decor--oil paintings of I don't know what on the walls, interspersed with strings of Christmas lights. The problem with oil paint is that it shimmers and clumps on the walls and makes the place look dirty even if it isn't. The restaurant was so dark I could barely see my fellow diner, which perhaps wasn't such a bad thing, as it meant I couldn't see the walls that well either.

I'd rather go to Na Siam up the street. It's not sit-down food, but it's consistent and the restaurant doesn't have that same smell or decor."}
{"text":"Service: wow...making a mistake in the order, two orders in a row????? is that just coincidence or plain incompetence? I let you decide.
A few weeks ago we ordered over the phone for pick up, and instead of a mild pad thai we got curry pad thai. I called to let them know and they put a credit for a free chicken pad thai for our next order. Fair enough.
Our last order, I mentioned this credit to the busy employee on the other side of the line, and he forgot to ask me if it was for pick up or delivery, and sent the poor delivery guy home when I was driving to the restaurant to pick the order up.
When I got there they only said: \"oh sorry...\". The one that got the raw end of the deal was the delivery guy. Sorry pal, no tip from us...that's why I always choose pick up.

Food: all I can say is this: decline. This place used to be good. That's why we kept ordering for the last little while. But lately the food has been either too spicy or too bland.

If you are looking for thai, the Junction has plenty of choices. Until I start seeing better reviews from this friendly thai location, I will not go back."}
{"text":"I'm in the neighborhood, and I order from Friendly Thai pretty regularly. I ate piles of Friendly Thai when I was preggo and then more when I was busy with a newborn!! It's not amazing or anything, but it's perfectly servicable Thai food, it's reliable for quality, and if you order for pickup, it's super quick. I've only had delivery a few times, and those times, delivery was super quick too. I think it's kind of sad that most of the Yelp reviews are about the speed of the delivery, not the food itself. Anytime I've picked up food, staff has been speedy and efficient. I usually order the \"dinner for 2\" deal, red curry chicken, chicken pad thai, steam rice. If you pick up this deal, you get free spring rolls too! Score! All for like $21 or something. It's cheap, it's fast, it's hot and tasty, it's close enough to the Film Buff, and I like it. What more could you want from your neighborhood takeout? :)"}
{"text":"I wasn't going to bother posting a review until a saw a few recent reviewers who echoed my experience exactly. I placed an order a couple of weeks ago using the online order system linked from the Friendly Thai website, they use Zuppler (which I've never heard of or used before). I had no problem placing the order online, and promptly received a confirmation indicating my order would be delivered in about 40 minutes. 50 minutes later I check back and it says it will be another half hour (over an hour from the original time the order was placed). When I finally called the restaurant I was placed on hold for over ten minutes; the woman I spoke to (who was actually very polite) confirmed that they had never received my order. The confirmation number I had didn't seem to mean anything to them. She offered to take my order then on the phone, but it would be the normal delivery time to get it to me.... what?! I didn't leave her wondering how I felt about orders that disappear in to cyber space and confirmation numbers that don't mean a thing. I understand that the real issue was clearly with Zuppler, but that's who they've chosen to represent their business, so it still reflects on the restaurant. Given all the other reviews of similarly bad delivery experiences, I don't think I'll be trying to order from Friendly Thai again."}
{"text":"Very very very tasty! 

I'd been craving pad thai for weeks, and after wandering famished to Silk and then Baan, which were disappointingly both closed for lunch on Sunday's, my boyfriend and I decided to head to The Friendly Thai. It was awesome- not sure why this was our third choice?

We ordered the pad thai and the Malaysian shrimp curry to share. The portions were huge, and everything seemed extra fresh. The curry comes in a large bowl with a generous side of rice and salad on a separate plate. After eating about half of each dish, we were completely stuffed. We agreed to pack it up and eat the rest for dinner. About 5 minutes after making this decision with my mouth full I believe I said something like: \" I know we should stop eating but... I don't want to\". 
The flavours, especially in the curry, were very bold and perfectly spicy. The pad thai was very saucy. That said, I'm not sure how \"authentic\" The Friendly Thai is...I don't remember eating saucy pad thai in Thailand, and there never seems to be any Thai staff or patrons in here, but if the food is good, who cares about authenticity?

Also, the prices are very reasonable.  The food and two beers cost $37 after tax. 

We rolled home and took a nap. A perfect Sunday."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious thai food. I got the red curry and rice, which was pretty fantastic. The only thing I would change is that it came with tofu and veggies, but the tofu was pretty scarce--it would have been nice to have seen more \"meaty\" pieces."}
{"text":"Friendly Thai is alright.

Same old thai food as anywhere else. 

It's nothing great and fairly overpriced ($20 +) per person without booze. Save yourself some dough and head elsewhere..."}
{"text":"I had a great time here; I just heard they have new staff working there. So no angry staff members anymore :D 

The food was easy, filling, in expensive and tasted great. 

Definitely order coconut rice with your dish.

Top 3 menu items: 

1. Oodles of noodles is definitely my favorite dish. (Egg udon noodles with tons of veggie and a choice of meat) served with Thai peanut sauce.

2. Basil beef (delicious!) 

3. Peanut chicken: lightly floured and fried in peanut sauce with mangos and peppers 

If you want something a little different the stir fried glass noodles are pretty good too.

Everyone I've ever been to a friendly thai with has loved this place. Soo yah. Definitely a great order in meal. I would advise having pad Thai at the restaurant. \"Rice noodles don't travel well\"

Again, easy, delicious food."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try the two top Thai places in the junction (Baan Thai, a few weeks ago) and the Friendly Thai the other day. 

The Friendly Thai appears much more modern than Baan Thai and has very Canadian décor. The menu offers a variety of both meat and vegetarian options all at varying degrees of spice (well marked on the menu by the appropriate number of jalapenos beside each dish). Any carb such as rice or noodles is ordered separate and is about $2/person.

The dishes are a fairly large size and are ideal for sharing. However, they do not have the same opportunities to try 4 or 5 dishes for one price as is available down the street. Which was something my friend and I really enjoyed last time. On this occasion, we ordered are separate entrees and because she ordered extra spicy and a prefer no spice, not a lot of sharing took place.

I had the Thai avocado chicken and loved the variety of fresh vegetables included in the mix. The smoothness of the avocado complemented the other stir-fried vegetables and meat. I ended up finishing the entire plate but in the future it's probably big enough to get two meals out of it.

Price point is average, servers are attentive, and they appear to have a steady stream of customers coming/going. However, I would have liked if they had combos so that customers weren't tied down to one entrée.

All-in-all, this place is a-OK but definitely not the best i've had."}
{"text":"I attended this restaurant last night with my fiance, two boys and a couple of friends. We had high expectations as we all like Thai food. Our orders were not delivered together, at least one person at our table received an order long after the rest of us started eating, people who were seated after us received service before we did, the staff were not courteous, and I am paying right now for what I ate last night. I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The Friendly Thai is a good spot for Thai. I enjoyed the pad Thai and vegetable spring rolls I had. The pad Thai had a slight sweetness, along with an appropriate (but not tear-making) level of heat. It was all served hot.

The service here is good, and the restaurant is clean. Take out service is available, and there is a 10% discount for take out orders of 15$ or more.

Most menu items fall between 8-12$ before tax.

This is a solid place to enjoy a good meal. It is not usually crowded , so you can probably walk in without a reservation."}
{"text":"Bland mediocre Thai food - the only reason this gets an extra star is because the service was warm and attentive.

With the kitschy interior and the music, I think this really isn't a 'Thai restaurant' per se, but more a 'bar that you can order Thai food -- not that it's a good idea, but you can\".  Think about it along those lines, and you'll do fine."}
{"text":"Service outstanding . Food, meh
Fresh rolls could have been fresher soup was average . There's better Thai on the 'hood"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday night with a party of four. It was pretty empty inside so the service was quite quick. I ordered the Classic Phad Thai that has chicken, shrimp and tofu pieces while the other three ordered dishes with sides of rice. The taste was good, not mind-blowing but no complaints. The serving size is quite large for the price (12.99) and the service was fantastic. Our waitress was very personable and attentive."}
{"text":"Quite disgusting. Worst pad thai I've had in memory. The mango chicken's chicken did not taste like chicken. We ate about 10-15% of the amount of food that was delivered and ate something else later that night... run! 
Adding insult to injury, it is priced like a decent establishment but you can get somethine you'll actually want to eat elsewhere - I'd go to Coco Rice instead. Same prices and much better."}
{"text":"It was my first visit and you only get first impressions once.

I went for lunch yesterday with a few business colleagues. The service was very friendly and there was very few people in there because we went early, around 11:45am. We ordered tea, it came completely cold, and we sent it back. The server stated they just turned the machine on so the water was not warm yet. Why did you serve it to us if you knew this? Not a big deal, but in terms of the entire experience, it didn't get any better.  Next we ordered our lunch, I ordered Hot and Sour Thai Soup and the Basil Lamb with Rice. The soup and some spring rolls for the table came right away and the Soup was delicious as were the spring rolls. Next we waited over 30 mins for our main course, in the mean time the place went from just us there to many people there, all eating food served to them, ordered after our food, served to them before us. For a \"quick\" lunch it was after 1:15 before we got out of there.

The basil lamb was tasty, but it could have been better, there was way more green and red peppers than lamb, but it was tasty.

The trip to the bathroom was not a very good one either, the basement smelled like bad fish and the washroom was not clean at all.

Sorry to be harsh, but this was not a great place, the food was good, but the environment and service speed out weighted my rating down to a 2."}
{"text":"This restaurant is now closed. :( 

****
First time ordering from this spot - and I'm a fan! Came really fast, hot and tasted fresh and flavourful. I had a craving for something slightly healthy tonight and found this gem online. I used to go to Spring Rolls, but now their food makes my physically ill - and I'm not really a fan of Green papaya or Lime.

Ordered the Thai avocado chicken and an order of sticky rice - and was really pleased. Opened the container of Thai chicken and it smelled delicious. Had a ton of vegetables - carrots, broccoli, mini corn, bok choy, mushrooms and almost 1/2 to 2/3 of an avocado. The carrots, bok choy, avocado and chicken were the best. The sticky rice was a red rice - very different and super sticky, but it sucked up the sauce nicely.

The Malaysian curry might be a better deal because it includes rice and salad, but I'll save that for another night. This place was a good deal with free delivery  over $15. It came to $18 after tax and I was told 40 mins for delivery. It arrived in 15!"}
{"text":"I have only ordered once via uber eats.  We ordered the red curry chicken and crispy beef, extra, extra, extra spicy and both we good, flavorful with good quality products.   Will definitely order from there again"}
{"text":"Tonight I ordered the \"Special\" Basil Beef with rice and the meal was very disappointing. The beef was incredibly tough which made the rest of the dish rather unappetizing and I did not even finish eating the meal .Although the service was good I told the waitress my food was not great and she only offered an apology."}
{"text":"The pad Thai wasn't great but I highly recommend the oddness of noodles dish.  Lots of tasty noodles and veggies.  Hopefully they can turn around the pad Thai as I live in the area and love Thai food."}
{"text":"I used to work here, so I've tried basically everything on the menu.
The cooks used to be amazing, and the food was great for the price you pay. The portion sizes were also enormous - could only finish half a pad thai comfortably, but then continue eating because it was so delicious, and then regret my itis and fullness afterward. Very fast service, very good food. Would've been 4 stars back then.

The problem is, this was a few years back. Since then, they've hired two new cooks as the other two have moved on. The last time I came here, the food was really bland, and regardless it just tasted off. 

If you do come here for convenience or just to check it out, I would suggest the curry pad thai. Regular pad thai is a little sweet in my opinion, so this gives it a more savoury feel.

If you want better quality Thai food, I would highly recommend skipping The Friendly Thai and go to Sukho Thai instead."}
{"text":"Food not that good and more importantly a Lil mouse ran by on the floor as we were finishing dinner"}
{"text":"I don't know what the heck happened to the Friendly Thai but the two locations I frequented  (Roncesvalles and The Junction) have totally gone downhill.  I used to eat at them both regularly and was happy with the food and how consistent it always was, then one day I went to one of them and everything was prepared differently (and BADLY) and I did not enjoy my meal at all.  The pad thai sauce tasted like bottled sweet and sour sauce and ketchup just thrown together, and the peanut sauce was icky sweet and not at all peanuty.  I decided to just stick with the other location from there on out but the next time I went I experienced exactly the same thing!  I am not sure if they revised all their recipes and sent them out chain-wide or if the Roncesvalles and Junction locations happen to be managed by the same people.  Regardless, it reflects badly on the entire chain and I will not be going to ANY location, EVER again.  Blech...."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and quick, the place was nicely decorated and well-lit (am I the only one who finds dim lighting in restaurants super annoying?), and the price was right.

So why only three stars, you ask? The food was blander than a Celine Dion song.

I ordered the Chicken Satay meal, and when the food came out, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I got for $12  - a full plate of stir-fried vegetables, four large chicken skewers with a bowl of peanut sauce, and a bowl of rice. The chicken and peanut sauce were good, but I resorted to swallowing the vegetables whole so I wouldn't have to deal with the bland sauce that covered them. My date ordered the Chicken Pad Thai, and it was similarly thoroughly unexciting. Really guys? If your Pad Thai isn't good, I haven't much hope for you :("}
{"text":"Ordered classic pad thai today and it was super bland.  The only thing you can thing really is sugar and it looked the chickens,  shrimp and tofu were just added on top.  It had no flavours.  Very disappointed -  it doesn't even taste like a pad Thai."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout from here (Singapore Vermicelli, Basil Chicken and the Veggie Glass noodles) and it was excellent! Arrived home hot and  very tasty! I'd give that a 5-star! 

We ate in the next day with my parents (veggie and chicken springrolls, authentic pad Thai, Singapore vermicelli and spicy noodles) and it was good but not as great as the night before. Still worth the 4-star though. You also get free hot and sour soup for the lunch special."}
{"text":"I have been disappointed with the quality and delivery times as of late. We have ordered from this place many times. It used to be really good and reliable. 

Tonight's delivery left much to be desired. The food took almost 2hrs to get here and we made 2 calls to the restaurant to get an eta. Finally shows up... cold. I am allergic to mushrooms and was very specific to exclude them from my order; it came with mushrooms. 

We called to again to complain. It didn't start well as they offered a $50 credit for next time...?! Anyway, we didn't want to argue it so we just let it be, knowing we wouldn't be back. About 30mins later the manager called and apologized. He offered to gives us a credit and remake/send our order correctly. I thought this was a really nice gesture on his part and appreciated that he wanted to keep my business. It made me rethink my decision and understand that sometimes shit happens. It's how you deal with it that matters and this guy did a great job. For this reason, he saved my business and I will give them another shot. 

Thank you for improving the experience."}
{"text":"A huge disappointment. I adore & know my Phad Thai, And theirs is definitely not Phad Thai. Got take out, and there noodles were dry, bland, and literally had no colour to it. Barely any meat, flavour or spice. Waste of $11 which is actually a bit much considering i've had some amazing Phad Thai for only $8-9 bucks. Never going there again."}
{"text":"Sunday night  where to go? I decided to try something on The Junction, and found this \"Friendly Thai\".  Amazing surprise, specially for a sunday night, when most good restaurants are already closed! 

It's well decorated and suitable for a cozy dinner, they offer full bar for a reasonable prices - so you can also go there for beer and drinks and won't be scared after you see the bill.

The food really impressed me. We asked for two completely different dishes, and an extra steamed rice. DON'T DO THAT, unless you've been starving for years in the desert. The portions are HUGE and two people can totally share one, specially if you ask for an entree or appetizer. 


I brought a folder home, and apparently they offer 10% off on take out, and some gifts on large delivery orders. I can't wait to try it!"}
{"text":"This review is for delivery.  The food is fresh, it's delivered quickly, and the lady on the phone is nice.  All of that is worth four stars.

The reason I give this place five stars is the seafood hot and sour soup.  I love a good bowl of hot and sour, and I feel this is the best in the city, by a long shot.  Best eight bucks I can spend."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place five stars for its seafood hot and sour soup.  It is truly the best thing eight dollars can buy.  Magnificent."}
{"text":"This was the WORST thai food I have ever had.  I ordered from them on justeat.ca.  The beef was so over cooked and tough we couldn't eat it.  The panang curry sauce was so thinned out it was watery and flavorless.  The chicken in peanut sauce was also terrible!  The chicken was over cooked and tough.  I will definitely not be ordering from here ever again..."}
{"text":"I won't be going back to the Friendly Thai, at least not for the pad thai. I've never had a pad thai so sickly sweet and watery. There was a wide array of veggies which was a plus, but that could not save this dish. I wouldn't have eaten as much as I did, if I wasn't starving. I tried a bite of a friend's curry pad thai, which had a good savoury curry flavour. This might bring me back there, if I had no other Thai place to go to."}
{"text":"Honestly disappointed. This used to be my fav place to get pad Thai, but the last two times I've eaten here it's been gritty, thick and difficult to eat. I haven't enjoyed it as much as I use to, and it's such a shame! Will not be trying this place again."}
{"text":"First, do not use 10% off for lunch delivery ever!!! It's kind of a bad trick. The menu says \"free delivery and 10% off for lunch delivery \"  I got delivery with 10% off of dinner price means same price as just lunch price. If you don't get discount, I can get just lunch special price and spring rolls as well. 

Second, I got worst Pod Thai in my life. The taste was like just ketchup and too much over cooked noodle."}
{"text":"Monday was the Chili chicken special. The sauce was okay to good. The chicken was mostly dry. I did mention this to the wait person. She said she would pass it along to chef. No reply back. I don't know about the other food, but I do not recommend the Chili Chicken. Had anyone else had a similar experience or was I just unlucky?"}
{"text":"Love this place I go all the time everything is yummy the portions are good Service is great 
, value for money it's one of the best places around highly recommended"}
{"text":"Great location, if you seat by the window, you can see all the people walking by. Food is good and the staff is nice ."}
{"text":"Once I ordered and they charged my credit card twice, it took me multiple calls to finally get my money back. Last week I ordered from this place again (I had forgotten my previous experience) and they delivered two hours later (it was supposed to take 45 minutes), I had already cooked (which defeated the purpose of ordering). The food was cold, except for the ice cream, which was a puddle by then. Terrible service, people on the phone have no idea what is going on and provide no help at all. There is another Friendly Thai in Roncesvalles, that one is great."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery using Uber eats. Got the curry phad Thai and Thai spicy crispy chicken. Both were amazing. Will order again"}
{"text":"I'm genuinely shocked by the bad reviews. I love this place! It's been our go-to takeout place for years. Great food, good prices, but it's worth noting that we order the regular stuff: pad Thai, green curry, fried rice, spring and fresh rolls. All so good!

What prompted me to finally leave a review is that today they send us home with 'green veg' instead of 'green veg curry.' I called and told them, and they sent the green curry via delivery right away, and let us keep the extra dish! The delivery guy was so nice. Thank you!"}
{"text":"The only decent thing on their menu is Malaysian curry, it's rather oily and heavy but the flavours are good, but that's about it. Everything else is mediocre, I have decided to not to order from them again after their fresh shrimp rolls arrived with single tiny shrimp and turned out to be nothing but a bunch of soggy old lettuce wrapped in rice paper which fell apart as soon as I picked it up. It looked like a 5 year old prepared it, to charge 7.99$ for it is an insult."}
{"text":"Good vibe in restaurant. Spacing may seem limited, however, I have not experienced any heavy waiting times. 
Food portions are generous, and of good quality. Menu is fairly extensive. More options than the average Thai restaurant I've visited in Downtown Toronto. 
Downside is that service may be a little slow. If you are there to talk with friends/family and take your time, this is obviously not an issue. Otherwise, it is a wonderful place to eat with very delicious food."}
{"text":"Yummy food and great service, the best thai food in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I wish I would have read the reviews before I went to this place. Instead, I ended up there on a limb at 1am in the morning due to the simple fact that nothing else was open in the area at the time, aside from Mc. Donalds that is.

The funny thing is, as I was sitting down waiting for my order, I noticed the interior of the restaurant and the sad decor that hangs on the walls. That's when I decided to whip out my blackberry and read the yelp reviews. It was no surprise to me how bad they were, and right then and there I even considered leaving without my order, but instead I decided to give the place the benefit of the doubt. 

Unfortunately, they were quite accurate. There was nothing about the shrimp pad thai that was enjoyable, not even the shrimp. It was bland and soggy. I didn't nearly eat half of it. I actually put some sweet chili sauce on the slimy concoction at a sad attempt to add some 'flavor' to the dish. Yep. It was that bad, I'm not exaggerating. I took one nibble of the veggie spring roll and then threw it in the garbage. I actually felt like I was going to vomit immediately afterwards, and that's no word of a lie. I wouldn't even feed my leftovers to a homeless person. End of story."}
{"text":"I love this place : the food is consistently good, the service is laid back and chill and it's busy enough without being congested so you never have to wait for a table but you're also never the only one there either . Their coconut rice is to die for, especially on the days it's extra creamy ! 

They also make a great red curry and I love their Thai chicken wings. I come by to this location at least once or twice a month. Definitely on my top 10 list of local faves."}
{"text":"I've been to the Friendly Thai several times and have come to expect truly friendly service and tasty dishes. The decor is very casual and notably different from that of most other Thai restaurants. We sat right by the window at the front, which was a prime spot for people watching. 

It was much too warm a night for soup, but the sweet and spicy mushroom soup is intensely flavourful and one of my favourite starters in the winter time. On this gorgeous summery night, I opted to try something new on the menu and was very happy with my selection. The seafood pad thai ($11.99) came as a huge platter of saucy rice noodles topped with loads of shrimp, squid, mussels, and even a lone scallop. Actually, that curious little breaded scallop was my only complaint. It looked and tasted like something that had come out of a frozen box. I really would have been more than happy if it had just been left out of the otherwise delicious dish."}
{"text":"After having passed by this new location of the Friendly Thai many times, we finally decided to try it one recent quiet afternoon. In fact, we were the only table in the long space for almost the entire duration of our meal. The TV was stuck on the weather and the lone server didn't seem to mind the static that was coming from the monotonous radio.

Our meals started off with what the server wanted to remind us were \"free\" appetizers. While it's always nice to get complimentary starters, most comparable Thai lunch specials include them (in Toronto anyway) and the repeated mentioning of that fact was rather tiring. Besides, the salad was far too onion heavy and was topped with bright orange bottled French dressing. The accompanying spring roll, although much less greasy than the nearby competition's, was only okay. My pad thai was far too sweet and ketchupy. My lunch date's chicken fried rice was too dry.

The service was not bad. You can tell that they have made an effort to make the space suitable for grabbing late dinners and drinks. There are high tops with bar stools and advertised drink specials."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good and consistent, but on the pricey side. I usually get green curry seafood at every place I go, so that's my benchmark. I have certainly had better green curry. This was adequate, not overly spicy, but not terribly flavourful either. 

I've only done pick up, but when I did go in to pick up, the place itself seemed fairly nice, but very small. Seating for maybe 20 people. 

I do find them to be on the more expensive side of take-away Thai. For the price I would hope for better quality... But they're super close to home, so they'll probably continue to be our don't-feel-like-cooking solution."}
{"text":"After having a not so great experience at The Friendly Thai location in the Junction, I decided to give the chain another chance and met up with friends for dinner in Ronncy.

We ordered the Curry Pad Thai with Shrimp ($12.99), Crispy Beef Special ($8.95) and Tofu Satay dinner ($9.99).  

Service was quick, friendly and food arrived steaming hot in an average amount of time.  Our meals were decent and better than the Junction location.  Portions were large and we had enough leftovers for lunch."}
{"text":"Whaaa happened, Friendly Thai?

I know they were closed for a bit for renovations (installed a few new booths where the bar was before) so not sure if it changed ownership or management.

This Friendly Thai WAS one of my favourites in the Junction 'hood.  We went in on a Wednesday night around 8pm.  The restaurant was pretty empty. I ordered the glass noodles ($10.99) while others ordered the pad thai ($9.99), curry pad thai ($10.99) and crispy beef ($10.99).

They use to have a special for $10 draft pitchers of Amsterdam but that was no longer available.  In fact, beer had disappeared off the drink menu all together.

When my glass noodles arrived, I was less than impressed.  It looked like a mound of clumpy noodles, all stuck together in a gross massive heap.  The noodles tasted a bit burnt and they were super spicy.  I don't remember seeing any indication of spice on the menu.  Not appetizing at all.

The whole time I was staring at my dish, this is all I could think of:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5S-a4Ex5Rw"}
{"text":"I was about to give this place 4-5 stars until I found a piece of elastic band in my food. I threw it all away wondering what else is possibly in this food."}
{"text":"Canadianized Thai food, with no discernible relationship to actual Thai food. Portions are enormous. Food is awful."}
{"text":"If I could give them 0 stars I would. Placed an order online, expected delivery was within the hour (and I live within 5 minutes of the restaurant). An hour and a half later, no food has arrived. I called twice (the first time no answer), they said the food had left and was on route. Another hour later, nothing. Tried to call to answer and no one picked up the phone. I guess they never planned to delivery us anything. Ended up going out to eat somewhere else. Their food is good but will not be ordering from them ever again."}
{"text":"So far, I have to say I am quite surprised that some of the best Thai food I've tried is in Toronto, specifically here in The Friendly Thai. I've tried Thai dishes in Bangkok and Singapore, and the food here is comparable to 5-star hotel quality in that part of the world. No kid. The only thing is that the portions were a little smaller than I expected. Keep up the excellent work."}
{"text":"Really disappointed by the Pad Thai here, the standard non Thai style red sauced Pad Thai with absolutely no tamarind flavour. Just red sauce and chilli. I don't understand why they would label it Authentic Pad Thai on their menu, this is just insulting... 

The mushroom tom kha soup was ok, but mostly broth and only a few mushrooms. The avocado peanut stir fry was the best thing I ordered. I probably won't reorder."}
{"text":"I had the pad thai; it was mediocre at best.  The noodles were underdone and the chicken was... odd.  Service was incredibly slow and not at all attentive.  The bathroom downstairs was disgusting and not well stocked.  I will not be back here."}
{"text":"Good local spot.  Tasty food at good value.  Nothing special about the place although the decor is pleasant.  Coconut rice is delicious and the red curry is decent"}
{"text":"This place is a favorite in our neighborhood. It is so unbelievably underrated; the food is great, maybe second only to khao San road out of all I have had in the city. The menu is varied, offering as much as Malaysian curry and avocado chicken: but their food is rich, and delicious. I order something new every time. The golden curry is my current favorite. It is also great value: the most expensive dish is $12, and as much as I am the storied meal finisher, I always take half home."}
{"text":"I'm keeping you at 4 stars Mr. Thai.  Not just because you're friendly or really anything above average but because you're consistent.  I can always rely on you for those nights I don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"Great value at lunch time. Servers are cool as well. Cheaper than fast food chains and way healthier. Park for free on High Park Blvd."}
{"text":"Do NOT ever, under any circumstances, order delivery. We have just finished with them this evening, after the 3rd time in the past 6 months where we ordered online, and received no response. Each time we have had to phone them, and their response is lacklustre to say the least. They don't care about yoru order, and they don't care about customer service. At all."}
{"text":"Not so Friendly Thai ?
I have dined in at this restaurant many times and have always loved the food even though there is some inconsistency in the way things are made, everything always tastes good. I have also placed many large orders for delivery over the last few years. The problem is that when I place an order for delivery 8 times out of 10 there is something missing like that extra coconut rice I ordered or the peanut sauce that is supposed to go with the oodles of noodles. So inevitably I have to call in and have them send my missing item.  I thought I could prevent this unfortunate thing from happening by reminding them to double check my order before it goes out. Well it still happened. I was still missing items so I had to call and ask AGAIN for my rice or whatever to be sent.  Well the last time the delivery guy came he said they are no longer delivering to my address because I complain too much!!!
WHAT!? So  when I am missing an item I should just shut up even though I paid for it? And not inconvenience them by calling and asking for my item?!
I was NEVER rude when requesting my missing item, I guess they just got tired of being held accountable for their mistakes. So I have gladly taken my business to Green Basil and I am enjoying their Thai Noodle Soup as I write this. After all the money I spent there at least $50 each time for my family, this is how I'm treated because they keep messing up the order?
NOT so Friendly Thai, I say."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the level of service I received  today.  It was on a take out order . The  simple request of making my noodles just a little more saucy for an exorbitant added charge , not like Im even having to ask for it on the side where I can understand the cost of a container to put it in . I'm reasonable I understand cost but  I'm purchasing noodles and I just so happen like a noodle with sauce on it as opposed to it being dry and  I've had these noodles here before many times and have on occasion received them dry so I've learnt to ask for it saucy and after all the business I bring you wanna charge me more than 30% of my dish cost is robbery. Definitely not worth it and it's soo sad as Im all about supporting my local neighborhood but when you going to start gouging me for a simple request for a saucy noddle as opposed to a dry one that's where I draw the line . Other Thai places in the Beaches or on the Danforth just waiting for my business gladly."}
{"text":"The food was sub par at best. Very bland. Our server was pleasant but not very good at her job, she kept screwing things up. Go to Papaya Thai instead which is very close by."}
{"text":"I'm personally shocked that I had to add this Leslieville listing AND that I'm getting an FTR for it, because at 6pm the place was bustling with activity and every table was taken!

There was the young couple to the right who were pounding back a bottle of Veuve Clicquot and arguing about control issues (not eavesdropping wasn't an option - my guess is they were talking about either a mother-in-law or a bridezilla), the group of tourists to the left who promptly ordered Pad Thai and barely lifted their snouts from their plates, and an assortment of other characters in the tiny restaurant.

Service was very friendly and welcoming and our waitress was prompt with water refills and our food order. She clearly took a workshop in Hostessing 101 because she was there to refill our water when we needed it, had multiple suggestions for our orders yet was never pushy, knew the menu inside and out and offered to wrap up our food without being prompted. 

I wanted red veg curry but when I asked for something spicier I was offered the Malaysian curry (which I didn't even see on the menu....oooh, special) with salad and rice. It was a huge portion and I was barely able to put a dent in it. There were all sorts of goodies marinating in the spicy sauce - bok choy, broccoli, tofu, red peppers, and yes, even the dreaded baby corn. AND YET I LIKED IT. Could this be the dawning of a corn conversion?

They also offer local delivery and 10% off for pickup orders."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Thai food, look elsewhere. None of the staff are even Thai. Pretty positive both myself and my girlfriend got food poisoning. Woke up in the middle of the night to throw up. Not fun.

They gave me a POT of ginger tea with ONE teabag. No freshly cut ginger. AT A THAI RESTAURANT. This is unacceptable but not to surprising this is a Thai place run by white people.

They forgot our friend's coconut rice. It was ready only after he had finished half of his entree. They took it off the bill thankfully.

The music was lame and uninspired. But the atmosphere and decor were OK, if a little white.

Overall not my best Thai food experience. Go to a restaurant in University district run by actual Thai people for the real thing. Was kind of strange and bizarre."}
