{"text":"I love everything, the food is very tasty, service was very good. will be coming back. will recommend to family and friends."}
{"text":"1st time here although we have driven by many times. Decor was nice, place was clean and John the waiter was very attentive and friendly. My adult son ordered Fajitas and I ordered something I haven't tried before, Huarches. The amount of meat mix for the Fajitas was double the amount you could put on 3 small tortillas.  We asked for more tortillas and was told they were $1 each for extra. His meal cost $23.50 with a drink and when I asked what he thought he said \"you make them better at home\".   My meal wasn't bad,  pretty bland for a Mexican place though. The Huarches was the same size as the plate so food kept falling on the table from it.  It reminded me of a regular taco salad,  just on a tortilla.   Probably won't come back but I have definitely  had worse. Too expensive for the quality."}
{"text":"The most important part is the taste, and it's there. They're definitely still putting the pieces together but nothing that will interfere with serving a good meal. The prices are also very friendly. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican restaurant in n las Vegas very clean and the food is very good"}
{"text":"Love this place. Authentic food and really tasty. The staff are friendly and responsive. They use fresh ingredients and the salsa is really zingy!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant north of Lake Mead BLVD, if not in all of the Las Vegas Valley. I lived in Tucson, which considers itself the Mexican food capitol, for 27 years, and the Red Tortilla is better than any place in Tucson! There are many unique dishes and they never use yellow cheese."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food in NLV! I got the machete and it was perfecto. Service was good too."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place!  My husband and I went here right after Christmas when they were only open about a week or two.  The food was amazing we told them that we would be back next time we're back in Vegas.  So last night I took my daughter and grandkids back for dinner.  I called and they had said that just closed.  I told her who I was and she remembered me and told me not to worry about it.  They reopened the restaurant just for us!  I can't  thank them enough for that.  The owners are a husband and wife team that work great together and the two of them turn out some amazing food.  Plus the customer service is beyond outstanding it's amazing."}
{"text":"Everything was so good!  I have not had such amazing Mexican food since we left California! We had a Mexican pizza with chicken breast, shredded beef burrito, and beef enchiladas.  Each item was perfection. Beautifully served and generous portions. My new favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Very good authentic Mexican food and in a great neighborhood too. The salsa was so good I can drink it! Their red tortilla chips was a perfect pair with their salsa. Friendly service and good food is the perfect combo! I highly recommend coming with lots of friends so you can order a variety and share. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I couldn't wait for this place to open, watching their Facebook like a hawk for updates. Finally got to try it recently.  It was ok. Kinda disappointed.  The place seems very quiet so I  was happy to be getting food to go than have to sit thru the awkwardness.          We ordered al pastor burrito with sauce.  The meat was good with a tangy flavor, but kinda got lost in the sauce which was on top as well as inside with not much else besides rice.  The chicken tortilla soup I probably will never get again. It was $7.99 for quart container of instant bouillon(could tell by the dried parsley flakes floating around and salty chicken knorr taste) corn, black beans and chicken chunks that turned an awful shade of purple because of the red tortillas they added.  I wish they would have put toppings to the side, instead of mushy togetherness.  The fried fish taco though was excellent but for $3+ each a little pricey.  Not very big.  Almost $25 for burrito, soup, and one taco.  No drinks.  Not sure if I will be back, maybe to try something different."}
{"text":"Open for 4 months, friendly staff and great menu. I tried the Machete which was awesome! Dig into their salsa bar with roasted whole jalape√±os, cucumbers, etc. Soon they will be adding tvs and additional decor. Try this place out."}
{"text":"Probably will change to 5 store once they have a chance to settle in. But amazing chef- everything from scratch including salsa. So good and awesome service from all from chef to owners all came out to make sure happy. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I paid 10.99 for 2 of the smallest tamales I've ever seen and a ramikan each of rice and beans. It was not at all up the the standards of any of the nearby Mexican restaurants. We will most likely not return."}
{"text":"Very authentic! Amazing taste and great customer service. Homemade/handmade tortilla, delicious"}
{"text":"This place has sparked my interest.  I had to return some items to Home Depot and I flashed that this place was near by.  So I stopped by on my way home.  Went in and the place is pretty boring for decor as well as staff.  Not a bad thing in my opinion but not a good thing either.  I ordered some red cheese enchiladas, and considering after a 15 minute drive home they were still some of the better ones I've had on this side of town.  I noticed some other things on the menu that is like to try but next time I will be eating in.  With 12 bucks for 3 enchiladas, not over priced, nor under, but a really good sauce.  Glad to see a place not replicating the horrible robertos bs.  I'll be back to try this place again."}
{"text":"It was good.  A little pricey, but the flavors were good.  I would try it again.  It looks inside like they are still decorating and getting the place just right.  The service was very good.  The chip basket was a good appetizer.  The salsa was super mild.  I kicked it up a notch on the heat scale with some hot sauce.  I see a photo of a steak posted, but I could not find it on the menu.  The sauces are colorful and very tasty."}
{"text":"Maybe the cook was out sick 'cause the food was really bland. My hubby didn't want to finish his burrito and that says a lot. I ordered the chicken tortilla soup and by the time I got home with my take out the tortilla chips were really soggy. It would be nice if they could put those on the side for take out orders.   I'm from Tucson, so I know good Mexican food and this place is not it.  Next time I want Mexican food I will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went for an early dinner with my daughter.  Restaurant was very clean and bright.  She had the kids quesadilla.  I requested a special veggie burrito which they were happy to make.  All the food was delicious, although I realize I didn't order anything extraordinary. What was out of this world was their salsa bar.  So many delicious options!  There was a nice hint of heat in some of the salsa's that balanced well with the other flavors.  I do not like salsa where all you get is heat. They have the perfect balance for this girl's palette.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"So this place is weird because the sign says Red Tortilla but its actually a different place. None of the menu items are the same and they don't have much to choose from. I was super tired and didn't feel like going somewhere else so we just ate there anyways. I had a carnitas burrito that was so greasy i had the worst stomach ache ever after eating it."}
{"text":"Amazing authentic food. Owners Rudolfo and Susan are incredible hosts!!  They really make you feel welcome!  Home made tortillas and salsas are fabulous !  Portions are huge!!  This place is a MUST do!!  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Man I am so HAPPY! I took the shot to try this place. We opted to go here for lunch while my kids were at school. First and fore most if you go here you are truly supporting LOCAL. It's a Husband and Wife team who are BRAND new so yes...they are working out the kinks and decorating. Yes the location is in NLV and its not a place you will see from outside and go try this fine dining spot.but as stated its BRAND NEW..Located on craig in a shopping center ..If you are in the area it's worth a stop. The owners genuinely seem like kind people who want to make us happy with their food. That whole \"Made with love\" thing feels very real here but just like with any place that just opened things don't always go smooth..I think if you try this place out and it is not what you want I believe they will try to find a way to \"fix\" it.   As I mentioned earlier my Mom and I stopped  in for lunch during the week,  I was not in the best mood while I was there due to some shopping I did earlier in the day but our Waitress who turned out to be the owner really helped turn that around. This place is currently set up as a sit down authentic mexican joint. Which means the prices aren't going to be Taco Bell status , I saw some people felt it was overpriced but to me it was pretty reasonable for the quality of food.. It isnt a chain or taco bell status .. if that doesn't work for you.. maybe try elsewhere but...if you do go here with an open mind and a empty belly.. I bet you will leave happy. I am pretty picky when it comes to Mexican cuisine for a variety of reasons but especially since I am not a fan of beans. Which often gets lost in translation at places like this 9 out of 10 times. The awesome thing for someone like myself about this place is the Husband and Wife team seem to be a mixture of American and Mexican.So she was able to align and relate to my experience with finding a place that has items I like while understanding that I don't care for BEANS or non chunky salsa . Plus English being her first language definitely helped but her husband appears to be from Mexico (Possibly elsewhere)  The owners names and info are saved somewhere in my notes on my phone but I have taken so long to sit down and write this I will have to come back and edit info later but now I will say the Wife who was our waitress is from California , I only spoke to the  husband  at the end of my meal  and he was going over some of the plans they had for the place concerning different ideas for the place. He was super friendly and happy to hear that I planned to be back  but I was the grumpy pants who was only half paying attention but I am hopeful things work out because I did enjoy the FOOD. Which is probably why you're reading this review so let me get to that part.     When you are seated they bring you their signature red chips and Salsa which are delicious. I don't typically care for salsa unless its closer to a Pico but this had a really great flavor. My experience with salsa like this at other places has had weird after tastes but this you can tell is made with quality ingredients and really is yummy.  Since I enjoyed the chips so much I decided to ask about the Guacamole. Since moving to this area I have found most places have this almost watered down version so I wanted to know what they have. Our Waitress (owner) was super kind enough to let me have a little sample. It was so yummy I opted to get some to bring home. Definitely could tell it was fresh made and the perfect balance.  My Mom got a Quesadilla that was made with a Red Tortilla, the cheese was good and even though its hard to mess up a Quesadilla this one just seemed to be on point .  After reading reviews I had trouble picking what I wanted. Since it was lunch time it made it even worse cause the space allocated for my tummy fill ups was hard to decide. . I ended up not being able to make up my mind so I got a few different things . I saw photos of the Tortilla soup so I wanted to try that and let me just say if  you are a fan of chicken soup I HIGHLY Recommend getting the Chicken Tortilla soup. It literally was one of the best soups I have had in so long. I am not a fan of beans as stated above yet I couldn't stop myself from eating every last bit of this soup. The flavors are on point and it didn't have any funky flavors every bit was good. You could tell the chicken was fresh and the tortillas didn't lose all their crunch.  Next  I opted to try out some Ala Carte Tamales which I had read people didn't care for the size but personally I don't want HUGE tamales because I want to be able to have a few different flavors and anytime I have had them home made by friends back in Cali they were around this size. My favorite tamale is always just the Cheese and peppers which Red Tortilla got RIGHT. I also tried the Carnitas Ala Carte which was yummy too! so  I hope you give this place a try even if its just \"To Go\" because I plan to keep coming back."}
{"text":"This is my first time.... This place is soo good, I love it.... Salsa is the best, quiet and clean.... Had the street tacos and they are really good... Customer service is awesome"}
{"text":"I liked the concept of this restaurant but Red Tortilla Mexican Grill still has a lot of work to do before they become fully functional. Upon walking in, you can tell they haven't settled in quite yet. The restaurant feels empty and quiet. I'm hopeful that with time, they'll be able to work out the kinks.  CHIPS & SALSA: The tortilla chips are indeed red. The salsa had a hint of spice. My husband and I were fans. 4/5   VEGETARIAN BURRITO ($7.99): Wrapped in a red tortilla and came with rice, beans, cheese, sour cream, lettuce, and tomato. The lettuce was unevenly spread in the burrito and there was some crunchy grains of rice in there. Other than those minor annoyances, it was an a-OK burrito. FYI, the rice has peas and carrots in it. 3.5/5  CARNE ASADA BURRITO: Came with everything the vegetarian burrito had but with meat. Husband said it was pretty good and had no complaints (except that the lettuce was not evenly dispersed). 4/5  SERVICE: Food was out in less than 7 minutes and our waitress was super nice. 4/5   *A salsa bar with all the fixings is available.   Worth a Return Visit? I knocked Red Tortilla down a star because 1) My husband said the bathrooms were dirty and 2) a tile on the ceiling caved in due to rain and caused an ensuing leaky situation. Overall, the food and service is pretty good but they have to work on facility maintenance/upkeep and just inject some much needed ambiance into the restaurant (like playing music!).

{"text":"Red tortilla is the Mexican restaurant we been waiting for in the North Las Vegas area. Carefully handcrafted meals that deliver in value size and taste. The tortilla soup an original to the restaurant is definitely something to rave about, the taste of the broth will linger in your mind for days. The staff is friendly fast and efficient. I hope they are here to stay the restaurant business is a hard business and needs the support of our community when a product is this great."}
