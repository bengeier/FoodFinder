{"text":"Great Mexican food! The chips aren't greasy and the salsa was fresh, spicy and flavorful. They give you both regular and spicy salsa to start. You can ask for tasty green salsa too.   I had the steak fajitas and they were cooked perfectly. All ingredients were fresh and seasonings were on point. 22oz beer was on special for only $3 when I visited. Will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Wow; best Mexican food around!  Glad I found this little hidden gem; I've driven past the small shopping complex daily for years and never stopped to eat there.  So glad we did!  I took the fiance there for her birthday, of which they gave her a special treat.  Service was great, attentive, and courteous.  Prices are comparable to any other Mexican restaurant (we went at lunchtime), and portions are just the right size with plenty of food.  The distinguishing factor is they have three salsas, of which they brought us the mild (a little smokey) and hot (quite spicy; me likey!) red salsas with chips.  All I had to do was ask for \"Verde\" (green) salsa and they graciously brought us some.  Make sure to ask for it if they don't bring it; it's delicious!  It is green chile and avocado based and has the perfect amount of flavor and heat to it.  Hands down, best I've had.  I could have made a meal just on the chips and Verde salsa!!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Has become our go-to quick dinner out place. The authentic tacos are amazing."}
{"text":"I really hate writing bad reviews, but.... Anyway, last week I went to Los Cuates in Concord to order some quesadillas and a margarita for take out. The quesadillas were tasty and so was the margarita. The problem is that the portions were disappointing for the price paid. Another problem was the customer service. There was no greeter at the cash register when I arrived, so I had to walk over to the bar to place my order.  I stood at the bar for two to three minutes before the bar maid even noticed me. She finally looked up from her conversation and placed my order. Even though she was really cool, I just did not appreciate not being noticed and having to wait.  Once my order was ready, an employee came up to me at the bar and told me that my order was over at the cash register ready for me to pick up. I mean WTF!!! Who does that? Why could the employee not bring my order to me and give it to me in my hand, as opposed to making me get my order at an unattended location.   By the way, my order had already been paid for, so what was the point of this? I will not return to this restaurant due to this experience. I felt insignificant as a customer due to this restaurant's poor customer service. This is unfortunate because the restaurant food is decent."}
{"text":"Food was fresh & delicious. Waiter was fast & attentive. First rate eatery!! Relaxing atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Can't say I'll go back.  The food wasn't bad, but wasn't good either.  On a weekday at the dinner hour. Service was ok. The food came out quickly, but I was about the only one eating at the time. Quantity was plenty for me; didn't take any home. Food wasn't worth coming back to.  Salsa tasted less fresh, more canned ingredients, I suppose. The extras on the plate didn't do it for me.  The salad with guacamole didn't 'pop', nothing to the flavor of the rice or beans. The pork was just ok... different than many other places I've tried.    They might do with getting a consult from an expert chef to review their ingredients, recipes and process."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill since changing management.  The salsas used to be really good, especially the salsa verde, it had chunks of avocado and really great flavor.  This new one is super bland with no avocado.  The mild sauce taste like tomato soup and the so called hot is no where close.  The service is slow and unattentive.  The food is no where near as good as it was, very salty and flavorless.  I used to go pretty regularly, but after the last few times being so disappointed I won't be back."}
{"text":"Just okay. I saw the five star rating from everyone and I just knew I had to try it but it is just ok. Mexican food is my favorite cuisine and I have yet to find a great Mexican restaurant in the Harrisburg or concord area. There were not a lot of people in the restaurant but we still waited a bit for our food. The salsa tastes like store bought salsa and the food was just ok. The server was nice though even though she kept asking us \"is everything okay\"...it was a bit overboard. I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"This place was amazing when it was first opened. I ate here religiously. Then owners changed and the food quality and service suffered tremendously. Won't be going back. Tried quite a few times in the past few months and was disappointed each time. :("}
{"text":"If you long for home cooked and authentic Mexican taste then you should try this place.  We had a great dinner and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I don't offer many 5 stars but hands down the best Mexican food I have had to date in Charlotte. Reminds me of west coast Mexican."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Nice vegetarian menu! I loved the salsas- hot and mild. My husband and I ordered our dinners with specific request/omissions to the orders (no dairy on mine, for example) and both of our orders came out quickly, perfectly and delicious!"}
{"text":"I think I have a new favorite Mexican restaurant. My son met me for lunch and we shared the steak fajitas and burritos supreme off the lunch menu. We couldn't even finish it all.   The fajitas were amazing. The steak was cook just right and and it came with plenty of sautéed veggies. The veggies weren't greasy at all. The burrito was stuffed and grilled. Perfection!  I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"When I called in the guy was extremely rude. I've ordered here before and tried to give them more chances. We order to go and both times our order was incorrect. Very displeased."}
{"text":"Here is the verdict. Food was good. Cheese dip was excellent!!! Chips were okay. Regular chips you would expect at any Mexican restaurants. As I was sitting here...eating my food and wondering why the reviews were so bad here. Well, I have an answer for you.    Service was good but kinda slow...and they charge for every little things you ask such as diced jalapeños peppers. It is a dollar. A table spoon or two worth of sour cream...a dollar. Doh!  Salsa was just an average.  Food (beef enchiladas with rice and lettuce) was really good. I think I will come back here again very soon with some dollar bills to pay for my little side items that are normally free. Lol"}
{"text":"Great food and great service. Everything tasted very fresh. The waitress even brought out my nephew a couple extra chicken tenders, which was very nice"}
{"text":"New here, checking out some local restaurant recommendations from Yelp. Greeted at door, no wait before seated. Clean environment. Simple menu. Waiter attentive. Would prefer salted chips and chunky salsa. They offer two salsas, mild and spicy  (taste at your own risk). My son loved his chicken and steak tacos. I would order my quesadilla a little hard. Would try in the distant future."}
{"text":"We tried this for supper the other night and the food was very good prices are very reasonable. Two salsas served, I liked the hot the best. Service was great.  We will definitely go back and try some of the other items on the menu.  The ACP will be hard to beat."}
{"text":"I wish I could give a 10 star review. This is the best Mexican place I've ever been to. Everything is great from the food to the service. I had the cheesesteak burrito and it's amazing. My husband got the nachos delight and said it's the best he's had. I will frequent this place."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waiter regularly disappeared especially when my order was wrong took forever to get it back. No customer service. Mediocre food. Overall a terrible expirence. \"New\" terrible management. Under staffed on a Saturday. No silverware and the waitress disappeared so couldn't get it until cold food. Overall a joke"}
{"text":"AWFUL!  Third time here since change of owner. Will be the last time. Every visit has been progressively worse. Service is terrible. Server has two tables and still can't take drink orders or deliver drink orders? Food might be worse. Chicken tonight tasted like imitation fish.   Place can be empty and it will still take 30 minutes to get your food. They're cutting every possible corner to save money and looks like they'll be closing the doors sometime soon.   Worst Mexican restaurant in Concord.  Word to the wise, you'd be better off eating at the Taco Bell out front. Will NEVER return."}
{"text":"The homemade horchata is excellent here. I never ever liked drinking it but kids favor it. Decided to take a sip and I was blown away. Definitely a special blend of horchata that I really loved.  As for the food, it was okay but not terrible. We only tried one salsa with the crispy chips. Salsa is mild and kid friendly. Rice and beans were great. Chicken enchiladas was meh. The flour tortilla used for the bean burrito was not good at all, but the beans were fine. The guacamole appetizer is quite a treat. It is served with sides of chopped onions, cilantros, tomatoes, jalapenños, and limes so you can combine to your liking.   Our waiter was very attentive and we lacked for nothing as he was always checking in. I appreciate this when I have my kids. They always need something!  I enjoyed the big screen playing Mexican music videos or slides of places/scenes from Mexico.   The restaurant is spacious with bright colored decor and beautiful Mexican art. Extensive alcohol drinks menu. Did not try any but I seen a few served to others and they all looked very good.  If I am ever near this area, I may stop in just for guacamole and a refreshing large glass of their delicious horchata."}
{"text":"Love the food! Nothing like fresh chips and salsa. Authentic tacos are delicious and the horchata is so good!"}
{"text":"This place is close to home so we gave it a first try and it's not anything better from other Mexican place .  The price was good $ 22 for two meals and drinks!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little Mexican spot in the Concord area, right on 29.  We have been a few times and had good experiences both times.  Service has always been on point.  Chips and salsa brought right away, and the salsa has great flavor.  They also have an extra spicy kind if you ask for it!  I have tried both fajitas and a combination platter.  The food was good both times, no complaints.  Portion was also good for the price.  I will be attaching a photo from our meal on our last visit.    There's also a patio, if you'd like to eat outside, and possibly drink specials.  We want to visit on a Tuesday, they have taco and beer specials!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing based on other reviews. Starting from the beginning, the two different salsas could be a nice touch  but the mild salsa simply tastes like tomato sauce. We ordered the Texas fajitas. The service was VERY slow, it took well over thirty minutes to get the food. When it came the order was wrong. The Texas fajitas came without any shrimp. They were just ok. Way more veggies than meat and very oily. What really bothered me was that we told the waiter so he could adjust the ticket but he didn't/wouldn't. It took so long to get the bill that it wasn't worth fighting. Poor experience. We won't be back."}
{"text":"The service was slow, both getting service and getting food took too long. The food was super salty but the margaritas were good."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, authentic Mexican food and the Horchata was outta control. Great staff and the price was not bad at all. The Food was delicious, fresh and came out fast. Even the chips and salsa were freshly made. Great experience, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for casual lunch and enjoyed the chicken chimichanga. They bring you 2 delicious salsas, one spicy and one mild along with warm tortilla chips. Chimichanga comes with quest, sour cream, tomatoes and lettuce. I skip the lettuce. Chicken was all white meat and very tender. The waiter was excellent and attentive bringing refills and more chips. The outdoor patio was great to enjoy the beautiful weather."}
{"text":"Great food. Friendly service. Authentic atmosphere.   I will definitely come every time I am in town."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and are so glad to have found this place!! We have been twice in one week! The people that work there are always so sweet and very welcoming!! They keep drinks filled and are all about customer satisfaction. Good chips and salsa and the chimichanga is very good!! Just wish it could be bigger but I'll just have to order the double dinner version next time:) I do wish they had a salsa bar but overall this place is awesome and we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Food is great. Staff is horrible. Could care less about correct orders. ALWAYS SOMETHING! Owner / Manager is never there to speak up."}
{"text":"I judge a Mexican restaurant by its chips and salsa. The chips were basic, i prefer mine lighter and saltier but that can be overlooked. The salsa was the perfect amout of chunky-ness, had a lot of onions and had a nice heat to it. They brought 3 salsas, the second one had my mouth on fire!! The creamy green one had quite a bit of heat and I think it may have had an avacado base. Over all I was very pleased with the salsas.   I ordered a meal called \"no name dinner\". It had rice, but it was more like a Chinese rice than a Mexican rice, 4 small burritos, 2 chicken with queso on top and the other two were crab and shrimp with red sauce. They were very good, they seemed very \"fresh\". I dont know how else to describe the food, fresh... some Mexican places drowned the food in sauces and cheese, which can be yummy, but this was more flavorful and fresh.   My husband got something like an Arroz con ?? Something with shrimp. It was amazing! We ended up switching plates 1/2 way through and I loved his! They were not skimpy on the shrimp!   We also got an avacado delight. It is a 1/2 avacado with pico de gallo on top and a jalapeno or two on top. I scraped it out and put it on top of the burritos.   Waitress was nice, kept drinks filled. Atmosphere is a little plain but Im not really there for that.... looked like they had a full bar as well.   Overall I was very satisfied. No complaints!!"}
{"text":"Fresh fresh fresh..and I like that.   Portions are big and flavor is all there.  I love the authentic tacos and for me..Taco Tuesday is the way to go, $1.00 authentic tacos.  The bill on tuesdays for our table of two people is normally under $10.00, where else can anyone get fresh, scratch made food for two people under $10 and leave full?  I also like it because it is a family owned and operated business."}
{"text":"Such good food. I am so glad the got then air conditioning fixed. Before that I could not go in the summer. The cheese dip is awesome! Chip are fresh. I get the taco salad, chilliquiles and Arroz con Pollo most of the time. All are excellent! I am so glad it is close to home."}
{"text":"I'd say 2.5 stars.   We walked in to a very strong smell of natural gas, but was told it was an issue with their beer tap and that it should disappear soon.  It did... We were sat and basically had two servers all night.  They were kind, but the food service seemed to take a very long time.  The chips are good, thick and warm.  We had queso fundido con chorizo and it took quite a while to come to the table. Then our entrees took much longer.  One daughter had a beef torta, and it came with very little mayo and missing avocado.  I asked for more and it came out quickly.  She said it was a decent sandwich.  I had asked for them to add ham to her sandwich, but they came out and told me they were out of ham. My meal, the No Name Plate, was supposed to be two shrimp and spicy crab burritos and some flautas- the shrimp was so over cooked that it tasted like rubber.  And I'm pretty sure there was no crabmeat on the plate, anywhere.   The cheese enchiladas that the other daughter had were good, as well as the husband's carne asada.    Overall, the meal wasn't memorable and the service was kind, but slow."}
{"text":"Under new management. Decided to stop in to say hello and grab a bite.!while in the area.  Great location and authentic delicious food! Easy to find! Great tacos! Would be a regular spot if I lived in the area!! Kudos!"}
{"text":"Updated to a 4:::After careful consideration!    This was a tough one! I want to give it 3 3/4 stars BUT a 4 is where I ended up...  First off, service was awesome! Two types of salsa, both are solid, spicy and mild. Chips were solid.  Chicken taco and chicken flautas were really good. Cheese enchilada was not very good. The cheese was just not what I am use to having at Mexican food places.   This is one of the better Mexican places I have had in the Charlotte area, so far.   So I updated this review - same food as La Unica - assuming it's related. Menu had same exact dishes! Good stuff either way!"}
