{"text":"I'm so glad to have discovered this place.  Great fajita's.  Beats anything in Champaign Urbana for authentic Mexican food, decor, and service."}
{"text":"Food is justifiably good at this place. My favorite thing about this restaurant which thrives over most restaurants in Tuscola is the wait staff. I always enjoy the hospitality the waiters and waitress display to their customers."}
{"text":"Food is good, but the employees make for a terrible visit. Horrible service, horrible attitudes of employees. No refills offered. Had 4 different employees at our table during our visit. Waiter just throws the food all on the table with out giving to the proper person. Waited over 45 minutes for a to go order and it was placed during the rest of the orders were placed. Asked twice for the Togo order before finally getting it."}
{"text":"This restaurant serves great food. It is always packed full of flavor, and cooked to perfection.
My favorite dish Is two fried steak enchiladas with cheese. It comes just like it sounds.
The perfectly cooked steak is packed inside a fried tortilla and seasoned to perfection, With the best tasting cheese poured on top.

I only gave Los Potros four stars because the waiter I had was difficult to understand, due to his thick accent. As well as the time it took for the food to arrive.

If you stop in tuscola, this is one of the best places to eat. I recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Chips and salsa were fantastic!!  Add the cheese sauce for extraordinary!  Margarita was delicious. The rest of the meal was a little flat."}
{"text":"This is a great place off the beaten path to stop when visiting the Tuscola outlets.

We have been here twice now. The service is friendly, the margaritas strong, and the food is fresh with minimal grease. I've had the pollo loco and lunch fajitas. Both were delicious. 

Check out this local gem and support small businesses!"}
{"text":"I stay in Tuscola for work a few times a year and usually head to Monicals for dinner.  I asked the gal at the hotel if there were any other places in town besides Dennys or Pizza Slut and she suggested El Patro.  Nothing against Monicals but I wanted to try something new in a three or four restaurant town.  The decor is small town quaint, clean and homey.  They have some soccer jerseys on the wall behind the bar.  The staff is friendly and attentive.  The standard starter chips and salsa was good, chips were warmed up which I think is a nice touch.  I got the enchiladas verdes dinner and was very happy with it.  The rice wasn't dried out like most Mexican restaurants unfortunately, and the enchaladas and green sauce were very good.

All in all I give it 4 forks up!"}
{"text":"Pretty typical Mexican restaurant. Nothing outstanding. Nothing horrible. 

Just okay."}
{"text":"I had the chicken fajitas and a margarita and both were very good.  The service was really good as well.  The only draw back is the restaurant was a little dated but no big deal.  Next time I am in Tuscola and need to eat I will go here."}
{"text":"Not a bad place at all to stop by if you've been shopping at the outlet mall. Nice staff and enviroment. The Tamale Tripicos we got was a good price for the ammount of food we got."}
{"text":"Ate here while traveling through. Their street tacos were delicious but their sopapillas were disappointing."}
{"text":"Food is typical Mexican. Chips and salsa are delivered to your table promptly. Service is hit and miss. We had a very rude waiter and a very long wait during a slow time. I have not gone back since."}
{"text":"We agree with what everybody else said. It's a hidden gem, I real hole in the wall, out in the middle of well, nowhere. The vegetables were very fresh, the warm chipsand freshly chopped salsa were a nice touch. They have a good size number of vegetarian options. I ordered the vegetable fajitas with my choice of tortillas, which were corn. there were three kinds of bell peppers, squash, two kinds of onions, mushrooms and more. My husband got a nonvegetarian dish that he really liked. I'll post some pictures. Everything was great, And it came out pretty fast."}
{"text":"Best chips and salsa starter ever.  Super huge menu.  Very reasonable prices.  We had Fajitas de Chorizo y Pollo (fantastic), Combo plate w taco, tostada, and chilli relleno, and a huge plate of 3 giant scratch made tamales with large chuncks of meat all drenched in a very tasty red sauce and cheese.   Fast Fast Fast.  Super tasty!  This place is THE place for great mexican food."}
{"text":"I stopped in during the lunch hour to try this restaurant for the first time since opening.  The food was very good.  The service was a little slower than I would have expected, even for not many patrons at the time I dined.  Overall the experience was good and I will return when in the area."}
{"text":"I travel for a living. I eat at many restaurants. I tend to avoid Mexican restaurants though, since most are just alright. Most can't compare to what used to be my favorite one. 

I think I found a new favorite. This restaurant is delicious. So happy in fact I'm posting this before I've even finished the meal."}
{"text":"It was typical Mexican restaurant cuisine. Not as authentic as I would have hoped"}
{"text":"I ate dinner here Saturday night with a dear high school friend that I hadn't seen in 14 years who recently relocated to Tuscola.  It was a night of nostalgia for that reason alone, but this place also reminded me a lot of my favorite (and at the time ONLY) Mexican restaurant in my hometown in rural Virginia.  (Apparently there are now TWO Mexican restaurants there, which is pretty big and exciting news.)

Anyway.

Now, on top of all the other exciting things going on for me this night, I also was THRILLED to see a very welcoming vegetarian section of the menu and on top of THAT, 3 out the 4 of us were vegetarians!  Really, could this be any more perfect?

I ordered my \"cheese dip\" which is just known as \"cheese dip.\"  Try as I might, I just can't find a Mexican place in the Chicago area that has it this way, the way I like it.  

I ordered the vegetarian dinner A or whatever.  The first one.  Lots of cheese for me that day.  My lunch consisted of mozzarella sticks and a grilled cheese.  I'm glad to say that my digestive system handled it just fine.

My husband (the lone meat eater) had tacos with rice and beans.  He's Mexican.  You'd think he'd get something other than tacos.  He has a slightly different opinion than I do about these particular Mexican establishments.  I'm not going to debate \"authenticity\" of Mexican restaurants with a Mexican guy, I just go on taste and if I like it (REALLY like it) that's all I really care about.  For him, it isn't enough food.  For me, it's perfect.  I don't like those burritos that are so wide I can't bite into them.  He thought it was very good though. 

It's also like, half a block away from the shop my friend owns so we just walked right over.  I would totally go back there.  I'm sure whenever I find myself in Tuscola, I WILL be back there.  Oh and the bill for my husband and I was $21!!!"}
{"text":"Our waiter was friendly and accommodating to our odd quesadilla request from our son. They seemed understaffed with only 2 waiters working lunch, but they did their best. 

The food was your typical tex mex; nothing mind blowing. A great local eatery if you don't feel like driving 30 minutes to Champaign."}
{"text":"Good looking restaurant with fantastic food. Immediate service and the staff is amazing. Tanya was our waitress and she was prompt and courteous and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Very authentic Mexican. Quick service, very clean, and the food was great. I think it was some of the best salsa I have had at a Mexican restaurant in a long time. I would highly recommend it and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food!  We found this by accident and what a great dinner.  The beef tips quesadilla is excellent as is the chicken quesadilla.  Warm chips with fresh salsa.  Great guacamole.  Yum!  Best mexican food I have ever had.  I will be back when in town,  Minutes from the outlet mall."}
{"text":"Great dinner at a local eatery after shopping at Outlet mall. Skip the chains and come to downtown Tuscola for some delicious  Mexican food. Great Margaritas and holy Guacamole!!! It was huge"}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Tuscola. The restaurant is very clean and the staff is friendly. The food is absolutely fantastic. They are quick to seat and quick to serve your food to you. Enjoy...."}
{"text":"Jose and the fam are the best at what they do! If anyone thinks its just so so you have no idea what true authenticity is then. 
Resturaunt is clean , beautiful and tons of dishes to choose from. I love watching them make fresh salsa & chips amongst many other homemade items. They are so sweet to my girls and always very cautious with any allergies you may have ."}
{"text":"Very similar to the hundreds of local Mexican restaurants in small towns.  Having said that, good solid food.  I would say the service, presentation of the food and the care taken to satisfy our requests was better than most.  For example, I ordered a veggie quesadilla, it was packed with veggies all right.  The accompanying guacamole and sour cream were served in a small tortilla cup instead of just plopped down on top of the food, which I thought was a nice touch.  We had a large party and they also opened up a seperate room and quickly pulled tables together to accomodate us."}
{"text":"Fantastic! A lot of places can't do tamales but the tamales tipicos are on point. Chunky salsa is good. Great place to eat."}
{"text":"I love the food especially the nachos I'll definitely be coming back because this place is a HIT!"}
{"text":"Great little place with fresh hot Mexican favorites!  We hat tacos and chimichangas it was all awesome!!  Q"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food hands down I've ever had. The chips were warm. The salsa tasted like it was freshly made. The burrito I had with beef tips and red sauce was perfect. I would eat that red sauce on anything it was so wonderful. My girlfriend had fajitas and she was so thrilled also. The food was served so fast. It had to of been 3-4 mins tops from the time we ordered to the time we had plates in front of us.  Who'd expect this from a small town in Illinois?"}
{"text":"Very diverse menu and quick service. I ordered the vegetable fajita, and it had several types of vegetables (mushrooms, zucchini, broccoli, etc.), not just onions and bell peppers, however, some veggies were slightly burnt. The waitress and greeter are extremely friendly, and they were attentive (refilled water, asked if we wanted more salsa, etc.) The atmosphere is bright and there is a lot of art on the walls. Look forward to coming back again!"}
{"text":"Amazing margaritas and food. Ordered the burrito deluxe with chicken and a jumbo margarita. The jumbo margarita was huge enough that my wife and i shared it. And the burritoes were also big portions. 2 meals and drinks were $27 so the price is reasonable. If you are in town check this place out."}
{"text":"Its ok. All of the food tastes the same to me. All of the dishes I've gotten have a red sauce on it that makes everything taste the same. The prices are good and they are one of the fastest with service I have ever been to. My family and I literally timed them one day, 4 minutes and 33 seconds for 3 people!"}
{"text":"My wife and i ate there the service was pretty good and the food was excellent but i do like Tex Mex better but it was a good substitute lol...
any way my advice if you like Mexican food and your in tuscola i highly reccomend it."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service! Best Mexican restaurant in the area, if not the state!"}
{"text":"Back again, guess this has become the regular place when we come to the outlet mall.  Wish it was closer to home!"}
