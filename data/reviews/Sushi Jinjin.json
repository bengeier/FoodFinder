{"text":"Excellent lunch spot. Fast, delicious and reasonably-priced! I like their bibimbap bowl, tasty and full of different flavours and textures."}
{"text":"The food is amazing, the staff is super friendly, the place is cute and the service is quick."}
{"text":"I've been going once a week almost every week since it opened up, trying most of their menu. The food is good, service is very good and the staff is super friendly and always willing to accommodate."}
{"text":"Depuis le temps que je voulais l'essayer! J'ai pris un  bulgogi Dupbap, ça valait vraiment la peine! Un dîner bon et pas cher! Attendez vous à une attente de 15 minutes si vous venez dîner, mais cela ne prendra que 5 minutes à recevoir votre repas, une fois que vous l'avez commandé! Une bonne place pour dépanner."}
{"text":"Everything I have eaten here is DELICIOUS. The names of the dishes are bit weird so I cannot remeber them-- Beef Bimbap? Somethign like that. It ALL tastes terrific. YUMMMMM. The chef and the servers are very friendly too. I've been about a half dozen times now, and every time it has been delicious. I'm hoping they make it past that critical first year in the life of a new restaurant. The ambience could be improved, but the food makes me forget that..."}
{"text":"Excellents repas coréens et sushis très frais, très bon rapport qualité prix (environ 8-12$ le plat), à essayer absolument! :) Un peu de line up passé midi, le mieux est d'y aller un peu avant midi si vous ne voulez pas trop attendre!"}
{"text":"The sushi was very good. Perfect amount of rice and freshness of the fish. I should have just ordered all sushi. I highly DO NOT recommend the ramen. It was Top Ramen with veggies and a few bits of bulgogi added in. I could tell by the smell and taste of the broth and the curls of the noodles. It's how I makeshift my ramen at home. Please serve authentic ramen."}
{"text":"Really happy to have a tasty friendly new Korean place in this area. I tried the  pork bowl, the Jeyuk Dupbab, so complex and nicely spicy and filling, I love the sweet potato noodles, delicious pork and rice, and it's a super affordable and heartwarming combo for lunch. There was a dumpling on the top that was really not good, seemed like it was decorative more than anything, but didn't affect how much I loved the dish, probably just a one-off mistake. Small, corner restaurant with big windows and two communal tables, you order at the counter and enjoy. Relaxed, tasty experience, I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I come here for lunch all the time. They have an amazing bulgogi Dupbap. The service is really fast for takeout and a quick lunch.  There sushi is subpar. I have also tried the ramen bulgogi it's good but not worth the price it's very basic. Definitely recommend the Dupbap and bibimbap!!"}
