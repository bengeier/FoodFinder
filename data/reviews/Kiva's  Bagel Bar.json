{"text":"I do not know who is saying these are the best bagels ever. They were stale. The person working the counter said they had been made today but clearly they weren't. They were mealy and day old at best. The cream cheese behind the counter that they claim it was chive was just a regular cream cheese with onions on top. I don't think they made the effort to make true chive cheese. The ruggelach were stale. The lox was also not good. There has to be a better bagel store in Toronto."}
{"text":"Top 5. Top 5. Top 5. Top 5 bagel ever. Oh boy, I've walked by the signage for the downtown Kiva's for the past 6 months waiting for this damn restaurant to open. Each day I'd longingly whisper to myself, \"someday, I will be inside you\".Well friends, today I bring news of change. Rejoice all of downtown as we finally have non-garbage bagels in the downtown core.  I have been inside of Kiva's and it is glorious.  Staff: Friendly Food: Delicious Pricing: Noticeably cheaper than their downtown competitor I won't name (It's What a Bagel) Bagels: Stupendous Clientele(me): Mediocre  Run, don't walk, to Kiva's as soon as you can."}
{"text":"I stumbled by this place by accident and Im glad I did. The service recieved was prompt,courteous and professional. I got the egg and cheese and it was great, except for the bagel being a little over toasted I like my bagels soft and chewy. I will stop in again to try a different sandwich. This bagel shop is exactly what that area needed I hope they do really well."}
{"text":"Love Kiva's! Had the pea soup and it was awesome. Fast, friendly and efficient  service. The bagels are a great- fresh and a good variety."}
{"text":"I liked my tuna melt on a sesame bagel.  I ordered and paid for their tuna nicoise and I added melted cheddar on top.  After I paid, they told me that they had not made hard boiled eggs that day so it wasn't much of a nicoise.  It still tasted good but I definitely paid more than the normal tuna melt.  Would have been nice if they offered to throw in a pickle or something.  I enjoyed the food but was slightly irked that I overpaid."}
{"text":"One of the great bagels of the city. Baked at their main bakery at BNS bathurst and steeles and delivered each morning. We need more great bagels like this downtown. Only criticism is bagels are not as fresh after lunch since they're delivered once in the morning. Go early and they're glorious!! If not early make sure to get your bagel toasted. Rugalah and coffee is great too. So glad you guys finally made it all the way downtown!"}
{"text":"They have a great twist on bagels, with amazing quality. But they seemed to not enjoy a younger audience, and wanted tips very badly."}
{"text":"The service was a little spotty/forgetful, but friendly.   Food was delicious and fresh, but a little modest in size.  When I order a CLUB  sandwich, I expect a three layer job - this was much smaller. On the other hand, it was the largest matzo ball we have ever seen in a soup.   Suggestion: play music in the dining space - Bay Streeters whining about their work ... don't need to hear it."}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Stopped in here on a whim and was glad I did. They whipped up 3 eggs and a toasted everything bagel with butter in about 4 minutes. Eggs were perfect, that bagel was amazing. Chewy, toasted just right, and smothered in coating (don't you hate everything bagels with sparse seeds, etc?)  I'd recommend to anyone who wants a great bagel and solid breakfast quickly."}
{"text":"Had the breakfasts bagel with egg and the coffee. The coffee tasted very sour, I'm assuming for leaving it out for too long. I got the regular and the sourness is pretty strong even with the cream and sugar. The bagel is ok, the actual bagel is relatively soft and the egg is decent. Would not recommend the coffee but the bagels are ok"}
{"text":"This is only marginally better than eating in the underground.  The quality is hit and miss possibly if this is a storefront outlet and everything comes from a commissary kitchen.  A clever way to operate but once again operators underestimate the downtown client. And the other reviewer is correct - I asked explicitly for cream cheese with chives when I could not see it in the counter.  I did see the cream cheese with green onion though.  Sure enough, what did I get on my bagel? cc with green onion.  If you are going to position yourself as having all quality items and a better deli experience, make sure everyone is on board.  You missed an opportunity to wow me and make an advocate and a regular. All you had to say was we don't have chives or better yet, we don't have any made up, give me a minute and I will make you some. Good selection of items for sandwich and deli, I have never seen anyone get eggs so no idea if they are organic or how the breakfast is.   Don't be in a rush when you come here, all things slow to a zen pace as we ALL wait for the one single toaster to do its thing. So yes okay-ish food but boy the people making the food and the decisions about your meal - not so much."}
