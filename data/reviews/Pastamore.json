{"text":"This pasta place is very, very good and it has been around for a long time. It is in Marche De L'Ouest. The food is always very tasty. I normally have a meat ball and a  sausage with my pasta. You get to choose your sauce, just pick any one, they are all very tasty. You eat this in the food court area and that is why I give it four stars, but the food is 5 stars. Consistent good Italian food in the West Island."}
{"text":"My favourite pasta place has moved to Plaza Centennial and I can tell you that the quality of their past hasn't suffered a bit. Their pasta is still the best in town. Keep up the good work Vincenzo and staff. Also love your cannolis."}
{"text":"Great parking, clean environment, great staff and quick service. I went here with my friend and they had the pasta. I'm vegan so I had a green spring salad and a roll. They have an amazing dressing which is balsamic and a hot dressing with kimchi in it. 

The serving was huge for the salad at $6.95 and my friend had a huge bowl of pasta and a bun for $10. I also ordered a tea for the two of us to eat it was only $23.00 which was amazing. 

It's worth it to check out they have an amazing menu and it sure won't disappoint !!"}
{"text":"C'est l'un des meilleurs endroits que je connaisse pour manger des pâtes! Ils offrent un large choix de sauces et de pâtes.  De plus, ils font leurs pâtes eux-mêmes!

Les portions sont généreuses, j'ai l'habitude de prendre une demie portion, qui est généralement plus un 3/4 de portion."}
{"text":"Have been passing this place for months now and suffering from the all too real cooking fatigue one day, I finally got my chance to try it out. 

The interior is very nicely done for a cafeteria style restaurant. You order at the front cash, pay and then they call out your number when your food is ready. The restaurant was spotless and they had some nice touches with their decor. 

The man serving me at the cash knew the menu inside and out and was great at guiding me to some of their more popular dishes since it was my first time here. I got my order to go and went with the cheese tortellini with the Michael sauce (mushroom rose sauce) and the chicken Parmesan which comes with a side of linguine with tomato sauce. Their pastas are made fresh daily on the premises. I was impressed with how well my order was packed, they included a small container of Parmesan and a container of spicy vegetables (so good) for each order. 

Portions were very generous and the price is hard to beat. I enjoyed both dishes and the only reason why it doesn't get a 5 star from me is that the pasta was slightly overdone, had it been boiled for 1-2 minutes less, it would have been perfect. I usually wouldn't take 1 star away for something like that, but since this is a pasta restaurant, I do hold them to a bit of a higher standard. That being said, I look forward to returning and trying some of their other menu items including their freshly made cannolis."}
{"text":"Excellent! Had the Veal Parm with linguine and bolognese sauce. REAL piece of veal not your veal cutlette. The home made pasta was perfect as was the sauce. All for less than $18.00 taxes in!
It's not your white linen table cloth type of place. But Great tasting food, large portions and clean. I'm coming back"}
{"text":"This joint has been serving up proper fresh pasta for a long time now. It's always good. 

I've had a sauce skimping issue a couple times but all and all it's a good bet if you're in the marché."}
{"text":"This has become my go to place when I don't want to cook anything haha! Absolutely recommend for simple but delicious home made pasta. You have a great selection of sauces and pasta to choose from, I think there's always something new to try. You can eat inside or ask for it to-go, and your plate will be ready in no time. The price is totally reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"Really get a bang for your buck here. The pasta never fails to disappoint i usually order the seafood linguine and it has always been delicious. They usually get it to you in five minutes and you can see them making the whole meal which is an added bonus. They fill the containers or plates until they are about to overflow and they give you a bread roll. All this for under $10 tax in. The staff have always been friendly and always accommodate anything you may want to change such as a different type of pasta. Food has always been piping hot and plentiful. I always pick this place when i want take out pasta beats any other place in the west island that charges 3 times the price for overcooked pasta with generic red or white sauces."}
{"text":"First there and food very good, if  you're looking for extremely clean and fast service then this is the place!  Loved our food, the staff was very helpful and polite....prices were awesome!"}
