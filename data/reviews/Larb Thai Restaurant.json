{"text":"Was decent food though you don't get a lot for the price. Didn't realize they don't give free refills on lemonade ended up paying almost 15.00 just in lemonade and there was just 2 of us. Doesn't hurt to try a place once."}
{"text":"Nicely decorated, attentive wait staff, excellent food, and artful presentation.  We will definately be back."}
{"text":"We went there to eat and arrived around 5:30 p.m..  We were greeted promptly but then questioned as to whether we had reservations which, we did not, nor were we aware we needed them as it is not specified on their website.  We did have a chance to view their meals that are all displayed on a table in a restaurant that could really use that space for more tables and have pictures of their meals printed on their menu.  We were offered seats at the bar when there were clearly at least 4 empty tables.  Since myself and my hubby are HUGE Thai food lovers we were not at all impressed and headed down to Strongsville to The Sweet Mango.  We will not be making another attempt to visit this too small with very sparse restaurant."}
{"text":"Food was delicious.  Had the green curry.  Staff was also very friendly.  Will def be back."}
{"text":"I really like this little place! Don't let the outside fool you. The inside is very nice and the staff is super friendly. They go out of their way to be sure you have the best experience possible. I ordered a Thai Basil Gimlet that was decent and the red curry with vegetables which was delicious. Prices are in the middle range. It's a cool local gem hidden in Brunswick and I hope it sticks around."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meals and the atmosphere was pleasant. The place was clean and everyone was friendly. We started off with the vegetable dumplings very tasty the only thing we didn't like  only three are offered, they are not big dumplings, I felt like there should have been four just my opinion but very good all the same. I ordered the Thom Yum vegetable soup delicious. My friend ordered the sweet corn soup she liked it very much. She also ordered the chicken pad Thai she said it was the best she's had so far, she has ordered chicken pad Thai at many other places and they were good but this one was better. Very flavorful!! I ordered the vegetable pad see ew,  I've never had anything like this before I was delighted it was so good! Then we ordered the pumpkin custard it was different in a good way we really enjoyed it as well as the whole meal and experience. We will definitely be back highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The full bar and friendly service are what give this place 2 stars. The food was the least authentic Thai food I have ever had. Chinese maybe, but definitely not Thai. I had the Tom Yum soup and it was sweet vs spicy. Even the Chinese take out place in Medina has more authentic Tom Yum soup. I hope they will listen to the Thailand born server!  She knows what real Thai should be!"}
{"text":"We dined at Larb this evening and had a wonderful meal. I'm so glad Brunswick has this restaurant. We've been driving by Larb for several months and finally decided to give it a try and were impressed. I enjoyed that they have vegetarian options and my guy enjoyed the beef Kaprow. He said the meat was very tender and had nice flavor. I had tofu Penang curry which was delicious and the tofu Larb which was also very good. I highly recommend this a good option if you are dinning in Brunswick. Oh I forgot to mention the service. Friendly attentive and he paced our meal nicely - will be back!"}
{"text":"Very pleased. Went for lunch with some people from work. I like Asian flavors, but don't know a lot of the difference. Thai vs Chinese vs Korean, you get my drift.

Very nice place. Small, quiet. Only a few others in there. Not a lot of businesses around there but thought they'd be busier for lunch. Service was quick, zero complaints.

Food was pretty good, got the dumplings, really good. I'm a big eater so I got the Duck Kaprow for lunch. It was very good, also. I asked that it wasn't too hot, came out perfect, just enough heat. 

Overall, I thought it was pretty good. Thought the prices were good too. Seemed right to me. I'm not a Thai food expert but I liked it a lot and will definitely be back. 

Added

Tom yum noodle soup... this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"The food is good, small portions for the price. They upcharge for tiny things which is kinda annoying. The staff was really friendly. We went on a Sunday and it was packed. I prefer sweet mango over this."}
{"text":"What a find! Best Lara Gai I have ever tasted. Service is marvelous. Portions are great. Everything was wonderful. The mango sticky rice dessert was yummy. I wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"One of the most authentic Thai food you will find in NE Ohio. We take every chance we get to drive forty minutes to dine here. Love the food and the friendly staff made the experience even better. As picky as we are (when it comes to Thai food), we have not had anything we don't like. Some of the favorites are Mee grob, Pla Ta-lay, Pad cee ew, Pad Thai, Poh-Tak, and Basil Duck.  My one year old loved mee-grob and chicken satay :) But don't take my words for it. Go try for yourself!"}
{"text":"Nice cozy atmosphere. Very clean and great service. Food was delicious. The owner, Amy, was very kind and did a nice job making sure we were happy with our orders. Full service bar too."}
{"text":"Loved the attentive waiter and quick service 
Quite and calm atmosphere. 

Food was excellent. 
So glad to have found this treasure."}
{"text":"Several shrimp in my entree were not cleaned.   Huge turn off.  Dont think ill be back."}
{"text":"It's good. The staff is super sweet. I will be giving it another chance or two over the next couple weeks as we went when they first opened, being very excited for Thai food nearby. I still prefer Sweet Mango, as I've been going there for a long time and enjoy their food and atmosphere. 

Everything we had was exactly as described and tasted good, but for me personally, didn't wow me. But I like the staff and really want Brunswick to get some more diverse food than cheap microwaved \"Mexican\" food and a zillion \"Chinese\" restaurants an pizza shops so I want this place to succeed."}
{"text":"Such a great place. I have been there twice. Excellent both times. Great service and great food. It's mouth watering. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Amazing little Thai restaurant in Brunswick! Wonderful service and great authentic food. We will definitely be back again and again."}
{"text":"This is a great hidden spot in Brunswick. We stopped by as we would always drive past and it always seemed busy and had great Yelp ratings. The place isn't that big but there is bar seating also if they are on a wait. I have not always been a Thai food fan based on other experiences however the Pad See Ew dish was excellent. We will definitely plan to be back."}
{"text":"Excellent new restaurant! Very nice decor and amazing food. Prices are reasonable. Our only suggestion is to greet tables a little sooner and more often. But staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Excellent quality. Helpful server.
Acoustics, not so good and probably a non issue had there not been a hyena carrying on nearby."}
{"text":"Delicious! My husband and I tried Larb this week for our Anniversary. I've never tried Thai food so I got the Pad Thai which was very good. We also ordered the Thai dumplings as an app and even did the sticky rice with mango for dessert. Everything was very good!
The restaurant is small but the decor was very cute too!"}
{"text":"Brunswick is in desperate need of new restaurants, so I was happy to see Larb opening. I am a creature of habit so I had the Pad Thai. It was good, my only complaint would be the amount of chicken in it. There was maybe 4-5 small pieces of chicken, for the price and the dish I would expect a bit more. We also tried the calamari which was good. A light tempura like breading and yummy sauce. I will definitely go back and maybe try something new! I hope this restaurant does well."}
{"text":"Wife and I met her cousins for a recent Happy Hour and dinner meal...had a wonderful experience!

The owner met us at the door and seated us immediately.  She is a bubbly, lovely lady!  They have an excellent Happy Hour menu with an extensive selection of discounted cocktails and appetizers.

Ordered our drinks and then began to peruse both the appetizer and dinner menus.  We are big fans of ordering Thai \"family style\" where we get a bunch of dishes to share / try around the table, which is exactly what we did.

Here is a run-down of the various appetizer dishes we sampled:
* Larb gai - minced chicken with red onion, rice powder, scallions
* Dumplings - steamed and served with a spicy soy sauce
* Chicken satay - grilled skewers with the traditional cucumber and peanut sauces
* Chicken wings - aweosme! Super crispy and served with a sweet & sour glaze on them
* Karee puff - delicious

Our main dishes included:
* Pad Thai - just average, have had better elsewhere
* Crying tiger - really excellent, herb-marinated sliced beef with spicy dipping sauce (not overly spicy dish)
* Mama's Fish - lightly tempura breaded flounder, really light flaky and tasty

A bit on the high side (price-wise) for the area, but definitely a quality meal and worth the effort to seek this place out.  I'm sure we will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been hearing about Larb for a while-- finally decided to give it a try. My husband got the duck kaprow and I got the spicy chicken noodle soup. Both delicious!!! We will be back to try out more"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my entire meal here. Started with Thai beer which was ice cold and very refreshing. Waiter made some great recommendations. Got the Yum Nam Tok as an appetizer and loved the grilled beef spicy lime dressing it came in. Just enough spice but nothing overwhelming. Ordered the Poh Tak per the waiters recommendations and really enjoyed the whole thing. Mussels, squid, scallops, and shrimp all tasted very fresh and tossed in a delicious spicy Thai curry sauce. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"New Thai place around the corner from my girlfriend's house. Yay!

This was a 4-5 star visit. 
 
The restaurant is small but pretty inside. It might be a good idea to invest in a new front door or at least tweak the one there so it doesn't slam shut and shake the whole building. Nonetheless, Danielle and I enjoyed our meal. 

Always adventurous, she had the chicken Pad Thai. I had the Panang Curry w/ shrimp - described as popular curry dish of blended red curry & peanut sauce. I'd never had it before and found it to be very good with a very little kick of spicy heat. The portion was a little small for me but Danielle couldn't finish her Pad Thai so she offered the rest to me. BONUS! I thought it, too, was very good though it could have used a little more spicy heat. She agreed and will ask for more the next time she orders it. We also shared an appetizer of calamari with a delicious homemade duck sauce for dipping. This was some of the best calamari i've ever head. i really liked it. 

Another cool thing I liked was the table near the door that showed their popular dishes. Since I don't know much about Thai food, I got a chance to check out some of the options and it made it easier to select a dish I'd not had before. 

This is a nice little place and I hope they succeed. It's also really close so that's nice too. We're definitely going back and you should check it out too, if you're in the area."}
{"text":"We stopped in here around 7 last night and absolutely loved it! The decor was great and service couldn't have been better.

Our food was fantastic! We tried the larb gai appetizer and papaya salad. Both had lots of flavor, tasted very fresh and were appropriately sized as starters. We split the duck curry next which was good too. We finished with the mango sticky rice which was the perfect finish.

Another positive was how nice the servers were. They were really attentive and sweet."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in Brunswick!  Great authentic Thai Restaurant that makes an hour drive worth the trip!  My group tried various dishes, I can't say I liked one more than the other but a couple recommendations for those interested are as follow:  for Thai newbies- Crying Tiger, Thai Dumplings and Mee Krob (on the sweet side but delicate and delicious), for Thai aficionados- Papaya Salad (classic), Larb Gai (classic flavors), Coconut Sorbet (home made and a must have).  Our group also tried the duck and eggplant dishes and nothing disappointed.  Last but certainly not least, service was warm and welcoming!  Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been coming to Larb since it opened a couple years ago. My favorite is the shrimp Pad Thai while her \"go to\" is the drunken noodles. Even our 2 year old (who has taken a liking to a little spice) loves them. I think the thing that sets them apart from other places is the freshness of the ingredients. Tonight I gave the duck kaprow a shot and was amazed. The duck was fried perfectly with a nice crispy outside and tender inside and the chili, garlic, basil sauce that accompanied was spot on. As far as apps we usually go with the spring rolls which are always cooked to perfection and the Thai or vegetable dumplings. Every time we drive by the parking lot is full and on a Friday or Saturday it is overflowing into the vacant lot next door. It's a great indicator that you are missing out on something if you don't stop in and give it a try. Long story short...we love Larb and are so happy to have a great Thai restaurant right up the hill from us."}
{"text":"Saw this place when I came back home to visit. It isn't in the best location but the food is very Authentic and interior decor was beautiful. Had one of my best buds who's Thai rate the food. The food was very Authentic and tasted great. The prices are reasonable. Definitely would go back again."}
{"text":"Ordered pad Thai veggie fried rice and the duck.... AMAZING!  Got take out and everything was so fresh and so delicious.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love Larb!!!  The food here is great.  Excellent service!!  The bubble tea and pho are wonderful."}
{"text":"Superb customer service and the food is delicious. Shrimp Pad Thai, papaya salad, chicken teriyaki, chicken or beef Pho noodle soup, and Mango dessert are some of the dishes we frequently order. Happy to have a Thai restaurant in the area!"}
{"text":"It was our first time at Larb and it was a great experience!   My boyfriend had the red curry with chicken and not only did he clean his plate,  but raved about it after every bite.   I had the Thai Pho and also thought it was very tasty.   The place is very clean and decorated nicely.   The service was quick and very friendly.   We will return again."}
{"text":"Love the food here. Had the chicken panang with some Larb Gai on my first visit and couldn't wait to return. Enjoyed the duck kapow on my second visit and my spouse had the red curry chicken. Restaurant looks small from the outside but the inside nicely decorated with seating for up to 40 ppl. Full bar with top shelf liquor is a bonus and the staff is super friendly. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food right here in Brunswick! The staff was very friendly and the food was great! Reasonably priced too! Cute atmosphere as well! I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the area . I liked the chili sauce that they have in the little cylinder glasses, I request for them every time I eat there  it's very spicy and ethic authentic !"}
{"text":"Based on Yelp reviews, we decided to check out Larb before a show at Mapleside.  Friday night, so we made reservations, but the place was empty at 530pm, though it did get fairly busy by the time we left at 630pm.

The wait staff was super friendly and helpful.  I got the #12, larb gai, which was actually listed on the appetizer menu.  I've had something very similar at a variety of other Thai places as an entree, and the Larb server said they offer it as an entree as well; they just double the amount;  Which turned out the be a nice size for a dinner serving, especially with the tom ka soup I ordered.  I actually brought some home, though not a ton.  My wife got the panang curry chicken, ditto on the serving size.  She also adds that her curry was not \"overly soupy\", which she hates, and that the tom ka soup had a nice sour flavor.

The flavor was excellent, though different; I'd never experienced it with the subtle lime flavor before. It's sort of a salad...it comes on a thin bed of lettuce and isn't especially hot, temperature-wise.  My wife's panang was also very good, though much more peanut-ty than I'd ever tasted with other panangs.

I'd asked for my larb gai to be SUPER SPICY, since other reviewers had mentioned that the spice level was somewhat disappointing.  We went through the usual, \"You want Thai hot?\" stuff that I always get when I say this, and they assured me it would be awesomely spicy.  And as usual, it wasn't.  Now, understand that I have an insane tolerance for pepper-based heat (I can eat a Trinidad scorpion pepper raw), so I don't expect much in these situations.  Another diner had mentioned that the restaurant will bring you a variety of sauces you can use to spice the food to your own preference, so I asked and they did.  The problem with this is that it changes the flavor of the food.  Cooking the ingredients INTO the food is the way to go.

When the server saw me dump the entire container of \"you-add-heat\" stuff on my food, he offered that the chef could dice me up some Thai chili peppers.  He did, and I dumped all those on my food as well, garnering the exclamation, \"You are the hottest person I have ever served!\" from my server.  I smiled and told him to remember my face, that way we wouldn't have to go through this next time.  I understand that heat is completely subjective and no restaurant wants to serve something their customer won't eat (and thus, won't pay for).  I usually have to \"dial in\" restaurants over a couple visits, until they'll give me what I want.  Larb Thai was very responsive to this, so points for that.  We'll see what next time brings!

The restaurant was super clean, with an interesting decor.  It's obvious that they took a somewhat ratty place and gave it a total makeover.  Outside temps being in the 40's, we ate inside, but there is an outside eating area.  However, you're staring at the parking lot and then Pearl Road traffic, so the ambiance won't be especially high.

Pricing was maybe a little higher than one might expect.  We both had ginger tea with our entrees and soup and the bill came in around $35."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner with friends.  A couple of us had the papaya salad (extremely good).  The entrees were also very good.  The place is a bit small and can get noisy.  Our server was good.  Overall the only downside is the size of the place.  Very clean also.  Recommend."}
{"text":"We meant to get subs somwhere and noticed this place right away since Thai in Ohio is a rarety. We immediately changed plans and turned in here to check it out. 

It happened to be launch day. Some other locals streamed in out of curiosity. The menu is simple which is great! We got some dumplings, satay, a curry dish, and Pak Thok. All the proteins were tender and the vegetables very fresh. I believe that the sauces were made in-house as they clearly did not taste like they came from imported bottles; if they did then I want to know which ones! They tasted so good.

Their main sign is yet to be completed as of this review, but the place has a very clean look and distinct style to stand out. Hopefully Medina County will give it a chance and this place survives. So far it's better than Sweet Mango's...and I like that place as far as super-local Thai. It's pretty much on par with Ty Fun and High Thai'd if that helps."}
{"text":"We've been to Larb twice now. First time I got the larb, last night got the red curry with chicken. I asked for the curry extra spicy and I got just that. Both my husband and I very much enjoyed our meals, the service, and the place itself is cozy and clean. Full bar, though I just drink wine and hubby gets beer. I am so happy there is a new place in town so much more interesting than the slew of chains and cheap Mexican. I thought the portions were good and the prices were just right. I highly recommend giving Larb a try!"}
{"text":"I am delighted every time I go to Larb. Everyone and everything is top notch with this fine restaurant. The food always tastes fresh and excellent. I can't speak more highly of Larb."}
{"text":"Very happy that Brunswick is finally reaching past the strip mall, chain, pizza restaurant rut it's been in for a long while. Larb was a nice surprise. The location is small but they made took time and effort to make it very nice and comfortable.  The food was very good flavorful curry without overwhelming coconut milk. The drunken noodle was spicy but with tons of flavor. The only drawback is the small parking lot and the wait. They are very busy and there were only 2 people running the floor including running and tending bar. This place is going to be a success so I think they need more help on a Saturday night and better parking."}
{"text":"Larb is a new gem in Brunswick.  The atmosphere is casually elegant and the food is fabulous.  It's a small place, but is definitly one of my new favorites.  The service was great and the staff is very friendly.  I had the Pad Thai and it was wonderful."}
{"text":"Honestly, very surprised that a place like this found it's home in Brunswick. I moved from Downtown about 8 months ago, and I believe the food is definitely good enough to be Downtown. I really enjoy the small intimate setting inside. Very nice decor.  

I ordered Thom Yum Soup and Kaprow with chicken. Both were delicious. I would guess that some suburbians may find the prices to be a tad bit high, but please know that this is not your run of the mill Chinese take-out. Larb has created well crafted meals with fresh ingredients. The inside is very small and intimate.

My wife and I definitely plan to make a return trip!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The people are so nice and the food is great. Not just delicious, but well presented too. A good mix of Thai deliciousness that has never disappointed. I have tried 3 entrees: the red curry, duck noodles and eggplant with tofu. Lunch portions are just right. 

I like the simple interior style and beautiful concrete floor. Sat at a window seat on a cold winter day without feeling a draft. I keep hearing there aren't good restaurants in Brunswick. Go here and you won't believe that lie any longer. 

Good service. Staff is attentive with tea or water refills."}
{"text":"Was tired of the same old same old and had been wondering about this place. Saw the reviews on Yelp so I gave it a try. They don't deliver like Yelp says so we got takeout. A lack of delivery was the only drawback. The food was delicious. It was fresh and full of flavor. The steak in the \"Crying Tiger\" was phenomenal. Best meal I've had in ages."}
{"text":"Larb is great. Authentic Thai-style cuisine. Expensive? A bit. But it's quality, fresh food. If you're in the Brunswick area, you won't be disappointed. If you're a bit further north up Pearl Rd. I would recommend Sweet Mango in Strongsville. Similar cuisine, but about $1 less per plate. 

Love seeing some new options on Brunswick!"}
{"text":"this place is so comforting and cute . my family and I visit every special occasion so we're regulars there now . the servers are always very sweet .  they play soft pop vibe music and they have very warm lights which gives the place a nostalgic feel . if I could give it a million stars I would . the normal thai pho is the best item on the menu and it is a fantastic atmosphere ."}
{"text":"This was our first time for Thai food. I had the flounder, my wife had the chicken blanket both were very good. The place is very clean, small and quaint. The service was great and the waitress was excellent we will be back."}
{"text":"On our way to another restaurant and noticed the Thai food sign.  Said what the heck and pulled in.  Cute little place with a cozy atmosphere.  We sat at the bar ordered a beer and ginger martini which was really good - will open up your sinuses if congested lol.  The chicken satay and Thai dumplings were fantastic and the sauces amazing.  For entrees we took our servers suggestion and shared beef and chicken dishes with rice and spicy sauces.  Prices were fair, food was fantastic and a nice option the area.  Certainly worth a visit."}
{"text":"Larb is amazing. V is even better.  She sold us on her dinner and appetizer suggestions, as well as the selection of alcohol. We went there for NYE last minute, and couldnt have chosen a better place.  Authentic and filling, but not overwhelming. We took the Drunkem Noodle home and we will be back for more."}
{"text":"Delicious food and a wonderful, friendly staff. Have dined in several times now and I always appreciate the consistently great experiences from the flavorful food and drinks to the people serving them. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from here twice before, and loved their food.  Today, I placed my order for pick-up, and it took over an hour for it to be ready. When my husband went to pick it up, they said it still wasn't ready. When he brought the food home, I immediately realized they gave him the wrong dish. When I called to complain, they were rude and kept saying it wasn't their fault, that there was something wrong with their ordering system. I eventually hung up, as they didn't even attempt to remedy the situation. Will not be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Everything we have tried has been great.. the only negative about this establishment is that the prices seem high for the portions you get..   I think we would go more often if they just gave more food with the meal.. other than that.. I hope they stay in business and do well.. we try to go at least once a month"}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended by our friends.  They were correct.  Great atmosphere, lovely wait staff, and the food was delicious.  The menu offers a large selection of appetizers, entrees, and desserts.  They also have a full bar. Try the chicken satay for appetizer.  The green curry is amazing."}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoy Thai food (he's more adventurous, but I still enjoy it) our first visit was met with a nice waitress who helped explain their dishes and recommended hear levels for my husbands Pad Thai. They had wonderful homemade spices and oils at the table. Good service. Good food. 


We enjoyed our visit and will be back."}
{"text":"Best Thai around!!! Thom yum, larb, Papaya salad, drunken noodles, curry....just get them all. I don't know how anyone can compare this place to sweet mango or take out.. If you know real Thai flavors, you'll be happy."}
{"text":"This food  is equivalent to mall food.  Maybe, mall food is a bit better.  Had to go to restroom just to get water.  Wouldn't want to see the staff in action if it was busy"}
{"text":"My wife and I would like to try different Thai restaurant, so we found this one. The food is ok, but portion is small. We both feel hungry after sharing 2 entree and 1 appertize. Even worst. We both have stomachache the same night and next morning. We really dont recommand this restaurant. Sweet Mango is better."}
{"text":"We popped in on cinco de mayo to meet my brother-in-law's family. I know what you're thinking: why would you go to a Thai splace on a Mexican food day?? Before you get too far ahead of me, I just want to say that Brunswick is a great middle ground for us (they live in Hudson, we're in Avon) and you're always hearing people say that there are no good restaurants in Brunswick, right? So we just had to find a good Yelp review to prove the naysayers wrong. There is a great restaurant in Brunswick and it is called: Larb Thai. The service: fantastic, the food: divine, the drinks: strong! All the things you want in a good eatery. It was my husband's birthday, so they brought out a plate of deep fried banana goodness with a candle on top, and we all sang our hearts out. The next time we're in Brunswick, you better believe we'll be going back to Larb Thai, Mexican holiday or not :)"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Completely legit food served by folks who really understand good Thai cooking. Try it!"}
{"text":"Saw this place a couple of weeks ago and decided to give it a try.  We went on a Friday night and surprisingly the parking lot was empty.  Despite this bad sign we decided to give Larb a try and we were glad we did.  The staff was warm and welcoming and the food was fresh and flavorful.  Prices were very reasonable.  Will become our go to source for Thai food."}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai I've had to date! Service was great. Everyone was so polite. Will surely be back!"}
{"text":"The staff is super nice and ver attentive! The best part for me is the Thai Iced Tea! No one around the Brunswick area makes it but they do! If they sold it in bulk I would be there every week. 

Seriously the most delicious tea you will every drink plus it's a bright orange color so perfect for browns Sunday's!"}
{"text":"Brunswick has long needed an Asian restaurant that does more than jam sodium packed, breaded chicken crap into plastic boxes and shove them out the door.

Larb answers the call. While a competing Thai restaurant in Strongsville to the north does a serviceable job with Thai cuisine, Larb brings us closer to the essence of the genre.

The spare but elegant interior makes good use of the space, and the staff is attentive but never overwhelming. Of course, the food is the real reason to find this place on Pearl Road and make it your Asian home for lunch or dinner.

I was truly amazed by the crispy duck dishes, and you will be as well."}
{"text":"We have tried larb twice so far. We had spicy pad Thai both times. The first time it was heavenly! The second it was just ok. I like their food but it isn't my first choice for Thai. On a side note: The service is always great."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphete here and the pad thai was great! I thought it was so cool that they had many of their popular dishes on display so the customers can see what they look like. Very helpful to someone who has never tried thai food. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here on our way home. We are avid Thai Food lovers. The outside will fool you it is gorgeous inside the floors are beautiful and its super clean. The staff was welcoming and friendly. The food was the perfect amount it was so good. My husband had the drunken noodles ( Pad Kee  Mao) and I had the green curry. I noticed they also have a full bar. This place is a must."}
{"text":"The food at Larb was really excellent. Expertly prepared, authentic Thai cuisine and very flavorful. What I think I loved most was the appropriate portion size. It was a perfect portion for 1 person- not an overloaded plate of food you're going to waste later. The price matched the portion and we thought Larb was a great value.

It was a very comfortable atmosphere and the service was nice.

We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Great little place for authentic Thai food! The people were so nice inside and the food is perfect. We ordered for take out and it was ready in 15 mins!

Had the Panang curry chicken, drunken noodle with chicken & fried wontons. All were wonderful! We're planning our second trip back asap!"}
{"text":"Came when visiting family in Ohio. As an LA resident, we have some incredible Thai food, but this was right on par!!!"}
{"text":"a surprising Thai place in the small town of Brunswick OH.  I was impressed with the décor here and the fact that it is family run and the cooks are Thai. they have all the classic dishes, pad thai, pad see ewe, etc as well as dishes like teriyaki chicken for the more timid.  they will adjust the level of spice per your request  good table service.  full bar. highly recommended if you are in the Akron area."}
{"text":"I visited Thailand a few years ago, and in addition to the history, the culture and the wonderful people, the food was amazing.  I have visited Larb twice now, and the food is every bit as amazing as I remember and the staff is wonderful too.  Visit it if you enjoy Thai food."}
{"text":"Delicious.  This pretty much sums up our experience for dinner here tonight.

We walked in and were greeted right away.  I noticed its a pretty small place.  Very cozy.  Decor is modern and welcoming.  We were seated at a table for 4 and the table and chairs were heavy solid wood.

The four of us split a satay appetizer.  There were 4 sticks served with a sweet and sour sauce and peanut sauce.  They both tasted like they were made in house and were very good. The chicken was very tender and pulled away from the stick with ease.  There was a sweet glaze on the chicken that complimented both sauces.

My two kids ordered chicken pho.  They said this place has the best pho they have ever had.  I took a sip of the broth and was very surprised at how good it was.  Very complex.  Next time I will have the 9 and 12 year old split an order.  It was way too much for either of them to finish on their own.  The 9 year old complained after dinner she ate too much.  It was that good.

My wife ordered the chicken teriyaki.  She said the chicken was very tender and cooked to perfection.  Served with broccoli and carrot on the side she ate the whole plate.  Raving about how good it was.  Served with a side of rice.

I ordered the drunken noodles with chicken.  It had some heat, but not as much heat as I've had in other Thai restaurants.  This was more standard heat like I'd get in a standard chinese restaurant.  The noodles were atop lettuce and basil mixed in with tomato and onion.  The sauce was rich and decadent.  Chicken pieces were very tender and delicious.  I also ate the whole thing.  It was delicious.  

Overall we had great service, delicious food, and an overall great time.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Oh you will never know! I have been working in Strongsville-Brunswick area for like 5 years and have recently found this place and this place is so amazing! Please avoid China King next door and order EVERYTHING from this place! Obviously the owner know what he/she is doing for Thai food in general! The first time I went there I had five spice ducks and my bf had eggplant mix, both were really good - the five spice duck feels like duck meat blended with soy sauce and just tastes like something from home, plus the dish provides enough vegetables (bok choi and broccolis). The eggplant mix - my bf added chicken to it and it's really good as well. The second time I got beef krapow (fried beef with basil), looks like a traditional Thai street food, very tasty and you could eat rice with the sauce. The only one thing is I always want more rice lol. Will keep going to this place and order pick ups in the future, I want to try everything on their menu."}
{"text":"Lucky: that's what Larb means and how I felt after finding this little gem. Thanks Yelpers!

Poh Tak, curry puffs were for me and my guest(safe play) got spring rolls and Pad Thai. How do you say hallelujah Thai? Each of us had clean plates...I had to give her a little help...thank you - don't mind if I do. Everything was very well prepared but let me tell you about the Poh Tak. 

There was an artful blend of flavor with heat that brightened up the properly cooked mix of seafood. The mussels large, yummy and the artful display nearly had me eating before getting my pic. Once done with the main dish I made my own little rice bowl with the remaining sauce and veggies. Ooooo weeee!"}

{"text":"If this restaurant was in downtown Cleveland, I wouldn't rate it as high as I am. However, this place is in the boonies of Brunswick (or at least what I consider the boonies of Brunswick). Let's start with the location, the restaurant itself is in an interesting building, part lodge, part renovated home. I wasn't quite sure what to make of it until I stepped inside; the owners have done a fantastic job tastefully decorating the place. It's a bit over the top, but in the best possible way. I'm told they shipped materials in from Thailand, and you can't help but notice the marble-esque floors, wood furnishings, and striking bronze accents. The inside really transforms into a romantic, quite special setting. There are only about 10 tables inside, and during the dinner hour it was a full house, so I would recommend making a reservation on a weekend for this reason. There seemed to be about 3 people running the floor, perhaps a married couple, and a younger bartender. The woman serving us was gracious and friendly, and the gentleman working there took the time to come over to our table afterwards to ask how everything was and chat. This shows me an investment in the business, and an appreciation for customers that come out. 
The food itself was good, not great, but I do appreciate what they are doing. They are serving mostly authentic Thai food, in a place where doing that means taking a risk. We ordered a Tom Yum soup and the Larb Gai as an appetizer, and both of the flavor palettes for these were on point. Equal parts spicy, tangy and sour, I wish more places did proper Thai food this way. For our entrees, we had the fish special, I believe it was called Mama's Fish, a breaded flounder which you can choose the sauce you like (we chose the tangy tamarind one) and the eggplant delight. As I said, the dishes didn't blow me away, but the flavor was good. I think the main thing I noticed is that the ingredients weren't as fresh as I've become accustomed to, but I think that's a consequence of the location so I don't fault the restaurant for that. 
We also ordered two drinks, a lychee martini and a thai gimlet. Both were fantastic, and I could see us coming here again just for drinks and appetizers. 
Overall, the price point was higher than I expected, but I will re-emphasize that I feel this place is doing something other places in the area just aren't doing, and for that I applaud them. Is the the most amazing Thai food I've had? Not at all. Will I be back? Absolutely! There's something warm and inviting about the space alone that makes me want to come back, and I can only hope that the owners continue to raise the quality of their service and food to keep the restaurant going in such an unlikely location."}
