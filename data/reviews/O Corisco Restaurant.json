{"text":"In the neighbourhood of Maple/Woodbridge, Portuguese Churrasqueira is a decent Lunch choice and a few of these aren't Franchises except for Nando's which is no longer available except when traveling east.  This Lunch spot is popular for the Students from the School within walking distance, and while not as popular as the Pizza Shop a few units further down it still has walk-in business.  There is enough space for a Dining Area the types of your local Pizza Pizza, so it's for the Eat & Go routine.  When looking for the Menu choices, I decided to forego the Meal simply because the Rice looked MEH and the Parisian Potatoes looked unseasoned.  I did like that they have choices such as Quarter Chicken or Half Chicken that doesn't force you to purchase it as a Meal.  Half Chicken($5.49) has the same Peri Peri sauce that is served at a few other Churrasqueiras.  The non-oily version, but I'm actually not a fan of the saucier version since it's less SPICY.  It's the same sauce as Gallo Churrasqueira which is within walking distance from here.  The Chicken was OKAY juicey but the Chicken Skin wasn't crisp enough and was still quite a bit of FAT left underneath the skin of the Thigh piece while the Drum was better off.  Price wise for a half Chicken at $5.49 is actually quite reasonable, I will give them that.  As you enter to pay you will notice the PHOTOS of the Family & Kids which is a nice touch for this Family Business.  I didn't see the Highschoolers complain about their Meals, so I guess maybe I'm just picky for Churrasco."}
{"text":"My experience with Portuguese Chicken is quite limited... OK this is really my 2nd time after my experience at Pollo Loco (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/pollo-loco-churasqueria-vaughan#hrid:ozihOWj6mh7pKs7szdmLyQ).   The grilled chicken at O'Corisco Restaurant is not bad but seems like it is lacking something!   Half Chicken ($5.49)  - There is not that oh so smokey smell when you entered the restaurant  - Chicken skin a little soggy, I like that charred crispy skin -  piri-piri sauce lack the kick and taste really blend... not sour or spicy enough?  The good thing about O'Corisco is there are 3 small tables where you can eat your chicken inside the store instead of making a mess in your car.... I have to eat my food right away... when it is the freshest!"}
