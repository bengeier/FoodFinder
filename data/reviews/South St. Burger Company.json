{"text":"Having never eaten a hamburger until I reached my late teens (no I wasn`t raised by vegetarians, I just didn`t appreciate the taste of meat)  I`ve been making up for lost time.  I love hamburgers!  So I was eager to try out South Street Burger Company in Newmarket.

The restaurant itself has somewhat upscale fast food decor (with requisite polished natural concrete floors) with friendly and enthusiastic counter service.  The staff member dressing my hamburger was very keen to add more and more to my burger and why not - with the exception of cheese (which is $1.00 more) the 25 or more dressings are free.  I loaded up on guacamole, garlic mayo and fresh veggies.  Hamburger meat here is naturally raised,  hormone and antibiotic free and without fillers.   French fries are New York Fries.  The salads here appear popular as well.  I didn`t notice that they serve onion rings as well and `real` milkshakes so I`ll have to go back soon.  Overall, prices are higher  ($10.97 with tax for a burger combo with cheese) than their burger competitors, but with the taste of these burgers,  South Street Burger Company doesn`t  really have any competition at all."}
{"text":"So I came here for pickup, the place was very nice and the staff was friendly. I ordered a bacon BBQ burger and the meat just had no flavor, maybe in the states we grill meat with more fat ay?  I also for the pulled pork poutine, that was better than the burger but the pork didn't live up to the expectation I had in my head. I would come back now that I know what to expect but I would def explore other opportunities as well for a better juicier burger. I may not have experienced the burger at optimal tasting because I picked it up and drove back. I would tell anybody to try it out at least, better than most fast food places."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent this location at least once weekly. The staff is amazing, the quality of the food and the overall experience is what keeps us coming back. I have a sever case of Celiac disease, however thankfully have NEVER been contaminated because of the diligence from the staff that work here. Specifically Valerie and Todd...they go out of their way to ensure my combo is served up with extra care, no matter how busy they are at the time. This is the ONLY burger establishment that is able to serve a full combo that is entirely gluten-free! They have a designated fryer for French fries, which is separate from the onion ring fryer. I love this place and would eat therefore frequently if I could afford it! It costs us about $27 for 2 bacon and cheese burger combos, one with a gluten-free bun that costs an extra $1. This is the only restaurant that I currently eat at, as I have been contaminated by many other various types of restaurants, and there aren't any other options for me in Newmarket. Thank God for this exceptional place, for without it I'd NEVER eat out! Cheers!"}
{"text":"My wife was craving a good hamburger on a Sunday evening.  
Didn't want any beer (wanted to be fresh and bushy tailed for Monday morning), and didn't want McDonalds or similar.  So, we loaded the kids in the car and headed to South St. Burgers.  
You know what, the menu is kind of confusing (as strange as that is to say).  We were finally talked into the family special (2 junior burgers or hotdogs, 2 grown up burgers, 2 medium fries, and four drinks).  The order taker was super enthusiastic about the menu and ordering. Was like 32 bucks with tax.  
I agree with the previous reviewer... this is upscale fast food.  
It does have these cool circular booths to sit in... kind of futuristic.  Yeah, it's a futuristic fast food place. 
It's fun to dress the burgers with the special fixings... spicy mayo, guacamole, some kind of orange chutney (forget the kind, but it was delicious).  My wife was asked what she wanted, and when she looked up at the options, definitely a deer in headlights... she asked for a moment to review... ha ha.  

All in all, it was good, although the kids could of split one the smaller combos (would of saved us a whopping 3 dollars).  So, we were satisfied.  
We did a group family high five after having quenched our burger requirements.  Mission accomplished."}
