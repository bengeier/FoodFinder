{"text":"Great atmosphere with very authentic diner appeal. It's not crowded with kitsch, a sure sign of a fake build-a-diner like Johnny Rockets. 

Breakfast is great and served with a smile. Before you put your empty mug down they're offering to fill it. 

All around a great experience and it's really worth a visit."}
{"text":"We definitely enjoy this place. I've only ever been for breakfast/brunch food, but it's delicious and well-priced. The staff is extremely friendly. The only complaint that I have is that they seem a tad understaffed during weekend breakfast and brunch hours, so sometimes it's a bit slow at that time. But I think it's worth it :)"}
{"text":"The food is great. Nice. The place is clean and good atmosphefe. Would come back for more breakfast."}
{"text":"I come here sometimes for a burger (take out). 
It is amazing. Seriously.
A gigantic burger is served with your choice of fries or salad.
However, the cook does NOT ask you how well you would like the patty to be done. 
Sometimes it is served medium, other times well done.
The biggest downside is how you have to wait a really long time to receive your order.
If your famished enough to eat a horse, you can visit hosu across the street.
Otherwise, stay and have a burger. This joint is slightly overpriced imo

If you are skeptical about eating a burger that's pink in the middle, please be sure to tell them."}
{"text":"Beyond gross. Just...everything is gross. Limp, oily, unsatisfying meals. I've never seen the place with more than a handful if people in it, so that should tell you something."}
{"text":"Sometimes a rainy walk through downtown, leads you uptown and in need of some solid comfort food. Open since the 50's Mars offers simple and satisfying food. Nothing fancy, but sometimes that's what you need on a rainy day. 

I recommend their eggs special $7 and it's a big meal.  Wait staff there are sincere and charming. Open all day and night, a great dependable place to dine."}
{"text":"It might have been some time since I had \"breakfast on Mars\", but I will definitely come back when I'm in the area. If you're an owl, or a club-goer on Yonge & Eglington, or just happen find yourself midtown after a good session on Friday or Saturday, stop by, they're open until the break of dawn. And the English style breakfast couldn't have gone down nicer. Staff is pleasant and knowledgeable. So beer selection is not the widest I've seen in this town, but it's only a problem if you're going drinking to a diner, which most people don't anyway. And only bottles.

If you're a sucker for good breakfast - this is it."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's obviously a greasy spoon type place but the food is always hot and fast and yummy. And the staff is really friendly, though they might forget to refill your water glass on occasion.
I absolutely love the chicken casear salad here. They make a garlic toast with rye bread that is really tasty and the dressing really packs a punch. Yum!!
The pancakes are huge and impossible to finish (for me at least!) and come with a few options for fruit and toppings.
Basically if you are looking for some tasty food served quick you can't go wrong with Mars."}
{"text":"The burgers and fries are decent after a night outing but not the best of choices. They don't get much traffic hence the food turnover is very low and quality will be just average and often disappointing , compared to some diners in NYC this place is just hitting its head against the wall ."}
{"text":"Mars was one of the first places I tried as soon as I moved into the neighbourhood, and I haven't stopped going back. Of course, you can't eat at Mars regularly unless you enjoy the consequences of a poor diet, so when I say I keep going back, I mean it's the first option after a night of drinking and general merriment. 

The menu is pretty extensive. Most of it is good, greasy diner food that we all know and love. I tried being adventurous once and ordered a hamburger sandwich and didn't like it too much. I also tried their steak and eggs and it was just okay. I stick to the corned beef hash, cheeseburger or eggs benedict (they have really good hollandaise sauce) and they have never failed to satisfy. 

It gets busy during weekend mornings, but I've never had trouble scoring a booth in the late hours of a Saturday night. The waitresses are very friendly and the service is quick. You can also order takeout if you prefer to pass out at home immediately after eating. 

I try not to go to Mars during the day in the summer though. It can get pretty hot inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Had the corned beef eggs Benedict. A really nice variation on a breakfast classic.  Food was served  fast.

The waitress was super nice. We came in 20 minutes before closing but she didn't rush us at all and was super considerate asking us if we wanted desert after we were done even though it was after closing time by then. 

Very classic diner-y aesthetic. This is maybe nitpicky but the menu has a terrible font and design.  For a retro diner they have this wacky wingdings/block letter like menu design that doesn't fit with the rest of the place. 

Overall good food, decent price, fast and friendly service."}
{"text":"In the Eglinton and Yonge district, it seems there are now several American diner-style restaurants to choose from. Mars is a middling sort of place with an uninspired yet  adequate dishes and unmemorable yet acceptable service.

I had Eggs Benedict for breakfast. The poached eggs were delicious but the hollandaise sauce was a bit flat, along with the homefries.

You will not be disappointed because there is nothing to be disappointed about. It is, in so few words, a diner."}
{"text":"The fries were great, I didn't order them - but my boyfriend did and I couldn't keep my hands off of his plate. He was fairly pleased with his burger as well. I however, was super underwhelmed by my Philly Cheese Steak sandwich. It was on the same stale sesame seed burger bun that my boyfriends burger was on, and had a very bland steak pepper and onion mix that seemed a little freezer burnt. Service was okay, likely not enough to bring me back. Maybe to try the breakfast that other reviewers seem to rave about!"}
{"text":"Marvelous poutine with tomato and bacon notes.
From a place that exists since 1951, the food is amazing and the squeezed juice delicous!

Awesome service."}
{"text":"Every time I come here im reminded of what good food and good service is.

Have had breakfast here so many times and diner on a few occasions. It has a wonderful menu to choose from and the plate is plentiful. The staff are always close by and quick with the order. The food itself is cooked in sight so it's gotta be right!

It's not cheap but it's not too expensive either. I've never had a bad meal in here yet. I confess that I have a thing for  retro 50's diner decor but, although everyone is tightly squeezed in you don't notice and it's comfortable. 

I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great Service, Okay food, and it did smell a bit.

Tried the Breakfast Special, 2 eggs, hash browns, sausage, and toast with unlimited coffee. The service was quick, pleasant and professional. The food arrived within 5 minutes and just as I had asked. The portions were as expected, the taste was within range although the hash browns could have been a little more diced up - no biggie! I would have liked a little more fresh fruit but again not a big issue.

I would go back if I was in the area but I would be tempted to try some of the other breakfast opportunities first. The restaurant is a little tired, a little dirty looking - but clean and I suspect the odor was from an inefficient exhaust and the general smell some Toronto restaurants suffer from - I don't know why."}
{"text":"Mmmmm! This is a great place to go if you're looking for an old fashioned Greasy Spoon type Diner. The food is plentiful; no skimping on anything and the coffee just keeps coming! They were short-handed yesterday so the Boss jumped in and waited the tables doing an amazing job, keeping us all happy. I had the Grand Slam Breakfast...soooo much food...but my Party agreed, the bacon was not as tasty as before. Still awesome place,tho'!"}
{"text":"We had a very pleasant breakfast at this diner. The food was good and the service was super!"}
{"text":"I was expecting this diner to be a little cheaper $40-$50 for breakfast for two people just isnt reasonable to me! 

The orange juice was lovely and fresh but the food was nothing to shout about.

The server was very friendly and food service was fast but i don't think i will be returning anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Solid diner, with all the usuals and a retro look at a reasonable price.

While looking for breakfast, I stumbled onto this place, and remembered their other location on the Beach, so decided to try it out.

Service and decor are on point for an old school diner, and the red vinyl booth seats take you back to the 50s.

I got the Breakfast Special ($6.45) with eggs over easy and tomatoes and toast instead of home fries. Adding sausage or bacon is extra but wanted to eat healthy in a diner for some reason. Washed it down with some bottomless coffee. 

For this price uptown at Yonge/Eg, its a downright bargain."}
{"text":"My eggs 'n onions were excellent and the home fries good.  Standard toast and coffee.

My breakky-mates corned beef hash was \"VERY good\", perhaps better than the Quarry Cafe's, which they proclaimed \"excellent\".  (Only complaint was that their requested \"soft\" poached eggs were a little hard.)

Our server was attentive and good natured which made for a 4-star experience."}
{"text":"This is a pretty typical greasy spoon serving your standard breakfast options at a reasonable price.

There are a couple of others like this in the area (Good Bite is one) and of all of them, Mars Uptown is my favourite. I find the food here the best (not insanely greasy, great omelettes), the seating to be the most comfortable, and they do the best job of making sure my 'bottomless' coffee cup is always full. 

It does get very busy on weekends (as you'd expect). 

The front display case where they show their muffins the last time we were there was disgusting (crumbs everywhere). Hopefully  not an indication of what goes on in the kitchen.

I'm not going to HIGHLY recommend this place because there's nothing outstanding about it but it is exactly what you'd expect from a greasy spoon and the best of it's kind in the Yonge & Eg area.

*Tip: Don't order a soft drink...apparently they come in the smallest bottles you've ever seen**"}
{"text":"Classic diner fare that always comes quickly and cooked as requested. Bottomless Coffee. Friendly and polite staff who never rush you to turn your table. Bottomless Coffee. Grand Slam and Eggs Benedict are always standouts at Mars. 

...bottomless coffee."}
{"text":"We were visiting Toronto with Family from the states and asked a random Torontonian for a recommendation for brunch!  The Mars Uptown Cafe did not disappoint. We all had different versions of the Eggs Benedict and one order of off menu crepes. All were delivered with perfection!!   Cool vibe and friendly staff. The owner even offered our US family free pie for their drive home. Thank you for making the trip even better!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my gf for breakfast and was very surprised at how good the food was. She got spring benedict ( eggs benny with spinach avocado and swiss cheese ) with homefries and I got the mars mountain ( scrambled eggs with bacon sausage homefries on top of a pancake with hollandaise . each breakfast is 12.95 so depending on what you order it can be pricey but well worth it . I will be back !!"}
{"text":"Went there on a rainy Saturday evening and found no problem securing a booth. The service was masterfully quaint, and the waitress was charming. We're a eat breakfast any time kind of people and so I ordered an English Breakfast. 

It was perfection! 

Eggs cooked just right, sausages the right amount of savory and the toast buttered with generosity. The baked beans were decidedly delicious. And to wash it all down we ordered a chocolate malt shake. 

All in all, a good spot for a cute diner experience that would potentially make for a good brunch spot!

Cheers!"}
{"text":"The Mars Diner, under new ownership, has been renovated and updated the menu.  We have been a number of times and the service and food quality have always been great.  My personal favorite is the Spanish Omelette while my wife enjoys a variety of other dishes including Pancakes and Waffles.  The new ownership is doing a great job and look forward to many more breakfasts."}
{"text":"super heavy but delicious breakfast. I had the Mars mountain which is everything; Bacon, Sausage, Pancakes, Hollondaise and Eggs.. It was on a dare and it might have taken 5 years off my life but so worth it. Service was very good too and even though the place was busy, it was prompt and nice. Its an old school dinner with the ambiance to match, but very unpretentious. Would go back."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst place I have ever been to. I was there at 11 am this morning, a Wednesday, so it was pretty dead. My sister and I ordered coffees. When I went to take a sip of the coffee I saw that it had lipstick on it. I'm not even sure how the server didn't see the dark red lipstick on the white mug. When the server came back to the table I asked for a new coffee and told him the one I had had lipstick on it. He did not apologize which I find pretty off since I work in customer service and when something is wrong you always apologize. He took the mug back and brought me a lipstick free mug. When we finished drinking out coffees we could see that the mugs had coffee stains which couldn't have been from us because we drank it pretty quickly. So they definitely do not wash their dishes properly which is disgusting. We both got omelettes and home fries. Both of our omelettes were runny, slimy, and uncooked. They also had no flavour at all. So gross. We couldn't even eat them. The home fries were actually good though, I will give them that. To top it all off, the bill came to $30. For two omelettes and two coffees, $30. So I just paid $30 for coffee with lipstick marks on the mug and coffee stains from someone else's coffee and two half cooked, runny, and slimy omelettes. Not at all happy and I will never go back and I will be sure to warn people about this place. Do not go and waste your money. There's three other (that I know of, probably more) breakfast places down the street. Go there. Even A&W does a better job at breakfast than this place."}
{"text":"Classic diner located in the heart of Yonge and Eglinton area. This place serves up your typical diner classics like eggs and pancakes so make sure to try this place for any brunch cravings. When you walk in here, it 100% looks like a diner, with the kitchen being open and the seating covered in red leather and steel table tops. The wait is very good, with your party usually being seated right away or within 5 minutes. The nice thing about this diner is that they offer a health spin on your typical brunch items! My favourite items are the pancakes and eggs Benedict so make sure to try these items out, you won't regret it. If you are driving here, it will be hard to find street parking so you may want to transit here or you will most likely need to park in a parking lot. Although they say there coffee is bottomless, you will definitely need to ask for refills. They aren't like a lot of places where the staff walk around asking if you would like a refill."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the morning after a night out, my feet automatically brings me to this diner for an awesome greasy breakfast feast.  

It's a hit-or-miss with the service, sometimes it's great, sometimes it's awful.  One weekend the service is flawless, the other times my toast is burnt and my eggs are wrong...but I can't stop going to this place.

Also, FYI, they have a wicked corn-beef hash breakfast.  Try it with the fruit shake and your hangover won't matter anymore because you'll be too happy with the bursts of flavours in your mouth."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great and it was nice and clean. However, we had an unpleasant experience with the food. 

First, they didn't have any BBQ sauce to dip in. I don't think this was an unusual request, how a diner couldn't have any BBQ sauce is beyond me (it reminds me of when Quisnoz's didn't have plain yellow mustard). 

She ordered tuna salad on a garden salad. There was no balsamic vinegar in the alleged oil and vinegar dressing and there was way too much mayo in the tuna salad. Then she found the feather in the salad. Yes, a feather. Where does a feather come from in a diner? Who knows. They certainly didn't.

They apologized and took it off the bill and offered something on the house but she had lost her appetite. Although it was appreciated.

The sweet potato fries were good, though."}
{"text":"Wow! This place was horrible.

Went with my son, I ordered the grand slam and he had the apple cinnamon waffle and tropical smoothie.
Where do I start. I asked for half tomatoes and half home fries well done. I received all home fries that weren't seasoned and had the texture of mush. Eggs I ordered over medium, they came out overdone with no yolk at all to dip my burnt challah bread into. Coffee was ok but at $2.25, meh. Sausage and bacon was passable. The hot cake was like a hockey puck, no fluff whatsoever and not tasty at all.
My son's waffle was big and mushy with no flavour at all. Even worse his \"tropical\" smoothie at $6.95 was watered down with only a bit of banana flavour. $6 frikin .95???!!!!! For a watered down ice and banana mixture...brutal..
Bill came to $33.79 , I put down a fifty and back came $15.25 change. Well there goes my servers tip too. I hate when that happens,  for $40 f'n dollars for a terrible breakfast, at least give me my bloody change!!!!!
Needless to say I will never, ever step foot in this \"restaurant\" again.

Pissed,

Austen"}
{"text":"Classic diner food. Always ordered the breakfast. Consistently above average and great for brunch or late night. Grand slam is the way to go!"}
{"text":"there hash browns are great, paprika,onion, garlic powder and shredded, crunchy the outside, the only beef with this place is the price way tooo expensive,,,,i  guess the rent is expensive uptown...but would go back if i has 40-50 $$$ to spend on brekkie for 2...."}
{"text":"Found this place randomly yesterday as a place to meet with friends. It is a small diner with cozy booths and an extensive, moderately priced menu. To stay in the 'diner' tradition we all ordered root beers and cream soda which matched perfectly with our dishes. I felt like 12 again - it was great! 

I had the Philly steak and cheese with a house salad on the side. Instead, of a greasy meat sandwich that would be typical of a diner, came a full flavoured meal that I would definitely consider ordering the next time around. 

The ambiance is just so welcoming, the service is great, and the food fits the bill! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Mars Uptown is good for that late night bite

After a night of clubbing, this is the place to go to

Breakfast is always a hit 

French toast
Pancakes
Peameal

Definitely the way to go

If not, a big juicy banquet burger is always a nice alternative

Again I would recommend this place for an after club/after bar eat treat

Classic diner food"}
{"text":"Always love coming here for their grand slam - best menu item for when you crave BOTH savory and sweet food, which is me all the time. 

Seating is pretty cramped, but it's a diner so I have no complaints. Service is good - servers always come around to see if you need refills. 

Price is average too, within the $ 12-18 range depending on what you order. 

I have yet to try their non-breakfast dishes."}
{"text":"They put some love into that food! I just got a BLT on brown toast with french fries. They are very generous with the bacon, and the veggies are very fresh and bright (as they should be lol). I will never step foot in Tim Horton's again for bacon.

I've also had the Philly cheese steak sandwich a long time ago, which I also remember being excellent. 

The servers are very sweet! 

The decor and music is lovely. Sort of like Wimpy's, but way more authentic 1950's. Love it!"}
{"text":"Had not been here since they revised their menu; 

Its somewhat of a diner, and after p
aying $42 for breakfast for 2 people, (including tip)
i thought it was a bit steep really.

The service was good, both times I was here, and you won't leave hungry!
The portions are a reasonable size, and bottomless, decent coffee too.
The waiter, knows his stuff, and makes some good recommendations.

The freshly squeezed grapefruit juice was a nice touch as well.
They have 2 sizes of it, small and large. Or go for the freshly squeezed 
OJ instead!


Pancakes are ok too, but if you can finish them, you must have been mighty hungry!

They have some nice muffins bran and low fat bran  , if you are into that, so get one to go on the way out. for a snack later....

Will be back!

PS I actually went to the Sunset Grill first, just down the street; but left because it was like an oven in there, and the staff was whining about having to fold napkins
etc...so I figured bad karma, and left."}
{"text":"Great food, everything I've ordered are pretty delicious. It's my regular brunch place. I recommend their chicken omelette on the special menu, as well as any meal under the healthy fair section. The only imperfection of the place is that all the seats are very tight, nowhere to hang jacket."}
{"text":"ive always felt that mars was a diner that tried to be like diners that have existed in the city for years, made the same food, probably made it better but didnt charge as much.

in the midst of writing this, it surprises me that todd v says theyve been around since 1951.  its not that i dont believe it, i just feel like its trying to maintain this concept and charging you for it, when probably they havent updated anything in any special way.

the food is the food is the food."}
{"text":"We've all been to old-\"style\" diners with fake finishes, gaudy paraphernalia-strewn restaurants that attempt to emote the days of the 1950s diner and sadly most to all fail to capture the essence.  More than classic Coca-Cola glasses and a cheeseburger on the menu is required to fully capture the feel of the experience.  Probably not having Bon Jovi blare through the restaurant would be a start.  At least there's a few places in Toronto that are the real deal, and Mars Diner at Yonge & Eglinton is one of the better ones.

Mars was established in 1951, right at the beginning of the diner craze and the layout and feel has not changed.  The look and feel is that of original fixtures, not of an archetype attempting to be recreated.  There are booths that line the side of the restaurant opposite the counter were service is available from a stool as well.  The menu is through-and-through diner, specializing in sandwiches, burgers, fries, and entrees that will be fried, greasy, and delicious.

As much as I love the items on the menu, the first thing I noticed was the pies in the front cooler.  Honest to goodness pies.  If not for a quick greasy breakfast, a fast lunch, or a retro-dinner, Mars is definitely one of the few places in the city where you can stop in the afternoon, get a cup of coffee and a slice of apple pie.  Groovy, Daddy-o."}
{"text":"My family and I went there for brunch recently.  The sat us at the back of the restaurant  near the kitchen, which is equipped with an exit door.  The kitchen staff kept propping open the door causing a very cold draft which hit us directly, and our 2 sons ended up eating in their ski jackets.  We asked repeatedly for them to close the door, which they did, only to re-open it a few minutes later.  We waited an unreasonable length of time for coffee.  The food was mediocre, and I felt kind of ill afterwards.  At the end of the meal, we repeated our complaint about the cold draft, and instead of an apology from the manager, we got an argument.  We won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place is by far the best breakfast spot in the Yonge and Eglinton area. Not only is the food always amazing, but the staff is even better! The owner is always there smiling and very hospitable and friendly. The waitresses/ waiters are awesome every time. Love love this place... a must try. 
P.S. try the pumpkin spice pancake... words can't describe how tasty it is"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, only for breakfasts.  There's nothing wrong with it, but it's definitely not stellar.  The first time I was there, two of the servers had a huge argument (which ended in one of them leaving after slamming some doors) in the middle of the restaurant.  Things were calmer on my other visits.  

The food is good - they have a healthy breakfast option which I quite enjoy.  It consists of a big bowl of fruit and yogurt and granola, and a bran muffin.  The bran muffin, oddly enough, is awesome.  They slice it down the middle and put it on the grill for a minute to warm it up.  It really is delicious!   Breakfast is a little expensive for a diner, typically running about $15 including bottomless coffee, tax, and tip.

It is of course very busy on weekend mornings, and there are often lineups.  But if you go during the week, expect prompt service and frequent coffee refills."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've tried in a long time! Also, the Reuben sandwich was delicious!! Would definitely go back to try more items off the menu."}
{"text":"A classic diner that does so many things right. Service is fast and friendly. Everything is typical of what you would expect from an old school diner. Has taken over as the most reliable breakfast joint in the Yonge and Eglinton area. Busy spot that gets the food out quick. Tasty and the fresh juice is great."}
{"text":"I thought mars was famous for there burgers? I guess not. The diner is cute and narrow. One thing you don't want to do is sit close to the grill, you will smell like good when you leave. I will go back for breakfast it's not too bad I hear."}
{"text":"Not enough large tables. We came as a group of 5 and we had to be split up because they had offered the only two larger tables to groups of 3.

The greek souvlaki was dry, and there wasn't enough tzaziki sauce. The portion size of everything except the fries was disappointing. The garlic bread and the souvlaki were dry.

We also had to wait a while to get both our food and the bill.

Free WiFi, password is uptown51."}
{"text":"Huge menu, great selection of food. You're bound to find something you want. 

Coffee got refilled frequently. I ALWAYS get smoked salmon eggs benny, but it's the first time that I see smoked turkey eggs benny so I got that instead. The hollandaise sauce isn't the best i've ever had, but the overall thing with the smoked turkey was pretty good and satisfying. Really like how they tossed some veggies in there too. Potatos were yum. 

Love that it opens early! Love the old school diner interior!"}
{"text":"Back on memory lane. This place throw you back in the 50's with the typical cmdecor and the American Graffiti soundtrack. Good burgers, appealing portions."}
{"text":"Open late, good for after the bar. Grimy but still pretty good. $10 for eggs benjamin, which is like eggs benedict but with smoked salmon instead of peameal... It's all about the benjamins!!

Hollandaise looks like melted cheese. Food is mildly nauseating but service is fast, friendly and food is tasty compared to other late night/24-hour diners (like Fran's and Denny's).

Hungry, late night, in the 'hood, go here! Better than McDonald's, Burger King and Golden Griddle for sure, and you pay maybe only $5-$10 more than the above-mentioned, depending on what you order."}
{"text":"Place is really nice , but a bit dated . Waitress was super nice and polite . Food was ok , not the greatest but not bad. Compare to other places I've been prices are to expensive for what you get. But I do have to make the remark that the men's washroom is one of the worst I've seen, was dirty and toilet paper everywhere on the floor and it's only 8:45 am. So do they really clean it??????"}
{"text":"I had the grilled Reuben here. I thought it was on the average to poor level. The service was quite quick and pleasant though. I think their prices are too high for what they offer. Having had a glance at the menu, I feel like most items are a dollar or two more than what they should be."}
{"text":"Standard diner joint. Breakfast was fine, nothing that blew my mind. Best part was the dark rye toast since you rarely see that ever. My omelette lacked cheese, felt like after thought. Home fries pretty good. Service was good. Overall, it was just fine, nothing spectacular or out of this world like its name suggests."}
{"text":"Me and three friends came here after our original brunch plans failed. We each ordered a different eggs benedict (they have quite a selection) and all cleaned our plates! Food was good, service was great and everything was done in a timely manner!"}
{"text":"It is really hard to give most restaurants I have seen or been to in Toronto more than a 2 or 3 star. I can't  believe the # of dumpy restaurants in this city. 
The only reason I chose this restaurant is because it looked relatively clean and nicer curb appeal compared to other brunch restaurants in the area.
Service was really good,  food was alright, and coffee made me feel a bit sick to my stomach. I ate the egg & cheese. I think Golden Griddle is still the best option in the area for brunch."}
{"text":"Please people do not come here!!!! It is disgusting !! The place smells, the food is horrible and the service is mediocre, don't wast your money.there are better places along young street."}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday morning with a few friends to have brunch. I ordered the French Toast with Whipped Cream and some fresh strawberries and I think it's the best French Toast I have ever had. Although I was a little disappointed to find that my meal didn't come with anything (like fruits) and that I had to pay an extra 2 dollars for any extras I'd like (strawberries, Nutella, whipped cream, etc.). 

Our server was very nice and didn't rush us when it came to taking our order; which is nice because I take a very long time to decide what I want to get. 

The place/ decor gave me a Riverdale/ old movies and show vibe which I enjoyed very much. 

I would definitely recommend this place for anyone who's looking to have brunch or breakfast."}
