{"text":"Loved this place! With the variety of clay pieces to choose from and the abundance of supplies (brushes, paint, etc) you can easily spend a few hours here. The staff was welcoming and tended to any questions we had, as it was our first time there. Will definitely visit again the next time i'm in Sewickley."}
{"text":"One of my best friends and I were out window shopping in Sewickley Village one day when we walked past the Clay Cafe and saw a sign for Ladies Night events.  The deal is that the Cafe provides some Hors d'oeuvres, you BYOB, and paint the night away with your gal pal(s).  Just RSVP to the Cafe. Easy!  So my friend and I signed up for last night's Ladies Night and had a ball painting a wine glass holder and a tapas/olive plate, respectively.  We sipped our wine, nibbled on the snacks, and listened to a Taylor Swift-inspired Pandora station.  You pick  your piece, paint, and pay for your item, plus a studio fee.  They will glaze and fire your piece(s) in a kiln and have them ready for pickup in about a week, but the owner says that if they can possibly accommodate you to have your item done sooner, they will try.  The staff was friendly and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Clay Cafe is a wonderful little place to paint pottery in Sewickley, PA, a short drive from downtown Pittsburgh.  I went with a group of friends for a low-key kick off a to bachelorette party weekend.  It was an adorable little shop in an equally adorable little town.  I had inquired ahead of time to bringing our little party to our shop, and they were so welcoming and friendly.  They had set up a table for us with balloons and cookies, and allowed us to bring our own wine and snacks.  For a $7 fee, you can paint as much as you want - you just pay for the cost of your piece.  The pieces are manufactured in a factory, but there are so many to choose from!  It's a low-cost, fun, relaxing activity that I would recommend for kids and adults alike.  Unfortunately, I don't live in Pittsburgh so I probably won't be able to return, but I'm looking for a similar place where I live!"}
