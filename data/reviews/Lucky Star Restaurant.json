{"text":"Good food for a cheap price. Basic Chinese food, if u are in the area and need a fast Chinese food this is a good spot. The place isn't that nice but the food is good for the price u pay."}
{"text":"It does the trick and satisfies the need to yummy food, quick, hot, and with friendly service. That being said it's not by any means the pinnacle of quality Chinese food, but for the price and convenience it's hard to beat in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Ok, this is one of my guilty pleasures.  I recommend you not pick up your food as it is the epitome of a grungy hole in the wall (they deliver).  The place does not look like it has been cleaned in ages.  But, look past the exterior and try the Singapore Noodles!!!  For under $7 you get a massive container of some seriously addictive chow!  I always get a bit of a tingly feeling in my mouth when I finish so Im sure there are plenty of preservatives and its definately not what I would call a healthy meal, but once in a while I just cant help myself..."}
{"text":"The food is suprisingly very good the ambiance dreary but service good food better than much  Chinese food found in Riverdale. Kitchen  visible and clean The prices are very reasonable less than the tip I often leave at high end restaurants . Do not let the outside appearance discourage it's about food and it is very good. I suggest take away. The serving are huge so one order will serve 2 . Pass on the hot/steam table and order from the board."}
{"text":"I eat there often for lunch, no fuss canadian-chinese joint, just watch out for sauces and soy-based dishes as those can be bad for your health, but otherwise the tastes is there, good prices too, if you like saucy fried meat like sweet and sour pork/chicken or a filling yang chow in the area, this place will do that in less than 10 mins."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try from all the food reviews on yelp and I'm so glad I did. I believe this is the only Chinese food place in the neighbourhood and the price is unbelievable for the quality. It's like a fast food place serving sit in restaurant quality."}
{"text":"Love the idea of a gourmet pork bun or \"bao\" place. Very casual atmosphere and standard pork bun price. Nowhere can beat china town pricing anyway or how. Interesting decor of the Chinese calendar zodiac signs as a mural on wall which is a great touch. Food is made fresh and has an amazing aroma. Everyone who works is quite good looking. Very conveniently located by ttc."}
{"text":"A review in three courses:  I usually order the spring rolls to start and they're typical fare.  One thing that Lucky Star unfortunately copies from other take-outs in the area is the ridiculously high amounts of oil used to fry the things.  There's always a mess of drippy oil in the little bag the spring rolls come in.  If I was a less gross person, I probably wouldn't eat them.  But they are delicious.  I also like their chicken corn soup.  It tastes just like the way I used to get it back in Washington DC.  They must have some sort of nuclear-capable microwave because the soup is always insanely hot and I forget and put a spoon in while I eat my spring rolls only to have my mouth burned.  I have tried that hot and sour soup as well and it wasn't that great.  Finally, for the main course I usually stick to the tried and true peanut chicken on veggie fried rice.  It's like a less offensive yet more tasty version of general tso chicken.  Overall the prices are cheap and the portions are huge at Lucky Star.  It's not 5-star dining but they deliver fast and the food doesn't suck."}
{"text":"Great price for value and very fast for take-out orders. Owner is very gracious and remembers repeat customers."}
{"text":"I would like to be able to give a rating on the food but I did not have a chance. My husband called to put in a substantial order. We were told that we were out of their catchment area for delivery and they wouldn't do it. Apparently they don't go beyond Jarvis and Gerrard. We live 1/4 block from Jarvis on Carlton which is the next street above Gerrard. Maybe the driver would have been a minute's drive north of Gerrard to get to Carlton and Jarvis where we essentially live. My husband was trying to explain to the woman that we were on the border but her rigidity just lost customers. Worse, she just hung up on my husband! What rude treatment from a business owner. We order a lot and this place stupidly missed the mark to gain a loyal regular customer."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious, the prices and the portions are good!  The place looks really run down and dirty. Best to call-in and get take out lol."}
{"text":"Pros: Reasonable food, delicious, great portions, friendly staff.   Cons: A little dingy.   Verdict: Would recommend."}
{"text":"Great place for a fast lunch.  Chinese food place with great prices and better than average dishes.  On the outside the places looks like a dive....as you enter it is not any better.  The only \"nice\" parts are the counter and the kitchen. The place is clean and the staff is very friendly.  They have only about 10 dishes to choose from, but it's not your typical fast food Chinese place. The veggie dishes are very lean and fresh, and the meat dishes are actual quality pieces of meat. None of the garbage 90% breaded, stuff.  Actual grilled chicken breasts, fine cuts of beef, and fresh seafood.  For 5$ you get 3 choices and a drink. You can't beat that if you are in a rush and need something in your belly.  Don't be afraid of the \"dirty\" appearance.... it's just an old building with quality food."}
{"text":"Greeted wiuth a takeout menu,(although we are eating in) which is scrawled:\"all prices are higher!\", but no idea how high. Many folks lining up for takeout, seemingly because it's the only Chinese venue in the neighbourhood. These people are NOT comiing from far and away for the food! Never having been here before, I assume they bought all their supplies fifty years ago, nothing has changed. Lemon chicken sauce is still basically Jello powder and water. Beef and whatever is basically powdered beef flavour and celery, although most of the beef is quite tender. Spring rolls are made with cabbage as it stands up better than bean sprouts, but cabbage really does have a shelf life! Even the soya sauce in little packets is meh, to match the decor. One m,ore Chinmese eatery to write off on the Yelp tour."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices. The service is always friendly and feels like that old school neighbourhood , family run, biz.   They deliver too. Their lunch specials are great for a delish and inexpensive meal.   Highly recommend this place - best in the  leslieville or east end"}
{"text":"This is one of those places where you can't judge a book by its cover. Definitely a hidden gem on Queen East, probably best for take out.   Lucky Star offers cheap and delicious \"American Chinese\" style food for all your fried rice and chicken ball cravings. We ordered  four items and it came up to $25. Pick up also gets you 10% off.   The wonton soup is really good and you get a decent sized serving, good enough for two. We also got general Tao, chicken balls and fried rice and was pleasantly surprised how fresh it was. Rice didn't taste old and chicken was tasty.   The cook is a older Chinese man who's very friendly. He called us just to make sure that our food was waiting for pickup. This is going to be a go to Chinese take out place now."}
{"text":"I always do take-out. and I pick it up (10% discount) because we live so close to it.  When my family comes over, very often if we're ordering out, this is one of the most requested (other than Tomasso's... will review next).  The food is cheap, the owners/employees are lovely, and it's much better than most fast food Chinese take-out around these parts.   Would recommend the following: Singapore nooodes, the spicy squid, General Tao chicken, and the Cantonese Chow Mein.  They don't skimp on ingredients; for example, dishes that feature shrimp actually have lots.  Don't be put off by the rather run-down appearance of the restaurant.  The food is worth it."}
