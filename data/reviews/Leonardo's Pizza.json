{"text":"I've had their pizza MULTIPLE times.  They are very generous with the toppings and cheese. The dough and sauce is good. Only complaint I have is that 20% of the time they don't pick up the phone."}
{"text":"The owner was very rude to my fianc√© when she was ordering, then called her back and was rude again. When I walked in, he was very nice. Seems he is a tough guy on the phone to women, but won't say anything to a man in person. The pizza was ok, but I'll never order from there again."}
{"text":"I have been getting this pizza for many years. Its always been my favorite, and the manager's special deal is just too hard to beat.  Its the only pizza place that doesnt give me stomach problems, and in all honesty tastes the best too. I disagree with the bad reviews.  Get this pizza once every week or every other week and its consistently fantastic.  I will continue to buy pizza from this place for the duration of living around here."}
{"text":"Yes, their Pizza is good and so are their subs.  BUT not worth the rudeness of the owner.  We are not ordering from here ever again.  I won't go into details but I'm so surprised he is still in business.  VERY Nasty 'tude.  Believe what others are saying. not worth it."}
{"text":"These guys are hit or miss.  Sometimes the food is Best but others you find hair or its made just like crap.  I don't know if it's the person who's making the food or it's just my luck with them. I'll probably try them again since they're so close to me."}
{"text":"I've probably had pizza from Leonardo's 20-30 times.  My best friend lives a stone's throw away, and anytime I come down to hang out, we get Leo's pizza.  No exceptions.  Two days in a row?  To pizzas in a row.  It's some of my all-time favorite pizza.  Medium-Thick crust that is cooked perfectly, generous toppings, and delicious sauce.  Bubbling, slightly browned cheese at the corners.  Mmmmm....  I've had nothing but the most pleasant experiences with anyone I've ever encountered working there.  My only complaint is that they close very early and sometimes close earlier than their published hours state.  That's their prerogative, but it's not great business.  To that end, I agree with the previous reviewer who said that the owner may not be a good businessman.  But the pizza is so good that I have several times wondered if I could buy their facility and recipe and turn it into a well-known, highly-profitable pizza joint.  While the rest of the previous reviewer's scenario is possible, it is just not probable.  The idea that any pizza joint would put her (and the other customers) through this kind of situation is hard to believe, and it's made even more difficult to believe by the fact that I have had a perfect customer experience every single time I've been there (and that's a lot of times).  I'm not accusing the previous reviewer of lying - that would be horrible.  It's possible she had the most horrible experience Leo's has ever dished out.  When I say that the scenario is improbable, that's meant more to be my message to potential future customers... my experiences, even coupled with the other reviewer's, lead me to believe that a trip to Leonardo's Pizza is going to be a good or great one."}
{"text":"Had pizza here the night before we flew out of the area  and I do not understand all of the negative reviews.  The pizza was delicious.  The sauce was perfect and the crust was done just right.  I would definitely eat here again.  Oh and the price was very reasonable."}
