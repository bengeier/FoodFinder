{"text":"The dirtiest place on earth drive by and see for yourself it's rotten and the food is gross the staff haven't had showers in months nasty place"}
{"text":"Awesome authentic Asian cuisine with friendly service.  Great customer service, always welcoming on the telephone and in person.  Our family will not be ordering from Chinatown again!  This is definitely our \"go to place\" for take out Chinese food.  A hidden gem of a take out and delivery place.  Don't let the exterior mislead you, it's great food, generous portions done exceptionally well.  Here is what our family ordered:

GInger beef, unbelievably good with just the right amount of batter.  Salt and pepper squid, delicately spicy with red pepper flakes.  Sliced chicken with black bean sauce, beautifully done with mushrooms and plenty of vegetables.  Hot and sour soup, Wow! that was amazing, the soup was substantial not like the thin broth you get in Chinatown.  Don't forget the beef with Shanghai noodles, good portions and beautifully flavoured.  

I don't care what the place looks like, there is a lot of care given to cooking real genuine food.  This place is it!  I would rather go to a place that cooks good food then to a place that looks great but the food is bland."}
{"text":"Authentic Honk Kong Chinese food. I order ONLY from this place for true Chinese food. If you want crap Chinese food that is available all over this city then look elsewhere for your ginger beef (a Calgary creation).  Reminds me of the market stalls in Singapore. Family run business. Every time I go in the grandmother is making delicious won tons or spring rolls at the front. Good portion sizes. Decent prices. Certainly worth going to. I moved away from the area in August and still drive back here just for their food. Well worth the extra twenty minutes in my book"}
{"text":"Pretty darn unimpressed. If you dine in, you're an adventurous one. I live very nearby and had never gone until I'd read other reviews on here. I see no reason to go back. Food is tasty I suppose, but it's on the expensive end for what should be a cheap lunch or dinner at a crappy take out spot."}
{"text":"Glad that another restaurant has decided to do deliver, lol.  Been opened about a year but just decided to hire the extra driver.

Average delivery charge is $5, depending on area.

From what I've been told from my clients, they're generous portions and these are the popular dishes:

ginger beef, dumplings, lemon chicken, salt and pepper squid."}
