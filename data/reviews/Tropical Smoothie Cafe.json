{"text":"By far one of the best 24 hour tropical smoothie cafe in town hands down. Only saying that because I'm a local and I frequent here. Nice to know that they actually remember me there. Service is quick, and convenient along with the friendly staff. Blimey Limey with mango please!"}
{"text":"I'm very upset about my experience at this location. I came in with my dog and was informed the dog could not be in the store. I informed the associate that the dog is my service dog. She still insisted the dog can not be in the store. Again, I stated that the dog is my service dog and offered to show her the dog's service dog card. Which she did not seem to care and proceeded to reiterate the dog can not be in the store due to the food. What this girl did is breaking the law. I can bring my dog in as long as I have her service dog card, which I had. But she didn't care. Your employees need to be aware of the ADA laws and rules. Clearly they are not. I will be calling the manager tomorrow when she gets in and filing a formal complaint. This is ridiculous and this girl needs know what animals are allowed and not allowed in the store. I'm furious and you've just lost a customer."}
{"text":"I used to come to this location all the time, as it is close to my house, and always had a good experience. Normally the smoothies come out quick and then it takes another minute or two for the food to catch up. Unfortunately the current group of employees seem to lack any motivation for efficiency or speed. I walked in and only one group of two ladies was in front of us. We ordered food and smoothies. It took around 25 minutes for our food, and our smoothies still weren't made. I ate my and finished my food while waiting for the smoothies. It took another 20 minutes for a grand total of 45 minutes for two smoothies. Seriously? I could have taught myself how to make our smoothies and finished them in way less time. For the nail in the coffin, the smoothies weren't even good. They tasted weak and watered down compared to what they used to be. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Hands-down the worst Tropical Smoothie location I've ever been to. Not once has someone greeted me as I came in, and most of the employees have an attitude problem and act like they don't want to be there. The smoothies taste good but the food sucks.They also don't apologize for the food sucking, for ringing up the wrong menu items, or for their slow service. About 7 of my friends have also had bad service here also. Honestly, I wouldn't even rate them as high as 1 star, but Yelp wouldn't let me put 0 lol."}
{"text":"This is the best tropical smoothie in Las Vegas! I've been quite of an addict when it comes to tropical smoothie lately. But without a doubt, best location in town! As I mentioned before, this one is open 24 hours a day. I had removed a point for how efficient they had been in the drive thru a couple of times. But looks like they are under new management and have also hired some new employees that have stepped up their game. Great service! Keep up the awesome work and keep the delicious smoothies coming."}
{"text":"The most disgusting bathroom I've ever seen!!! I sure hope the kitchen isn't taken care of the same way. Will never go to this one again."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute disappointment. The kids working there have no supervision. I stood in the store with nobody in site for over 4 minutes. Then a guy walks out of the back looking like he just woke up from a nap. It's 9am! Poorly run establishment and the worst part is that the other stores are running the same way. 

There is no quality at Tropical Smoothie Cafe locations."}
{"text":"I am in love with Tropical Smoothie Cafe (especially this location)!  The owners are extremely nice and almost always there saying hello to their returning customers. The employees are very nice and the location is extremely clean. The food here is awesome too! I think their smoothies are amazing! I have tried about 9 different smoothies and can honestly say I liked them all. 
I am a very picky person when it comes to eating out, but I LOVE this place. The food is healthy and delicious and the place is immaculate. I couldn't dream of going anywhere else!"}
{"text":"It was Happy hour, buy 2 get 1 one and the steak taco was amazing. So good, my daughter had to get her own instead of us sharing. The service and timeliness was also a plus."}
{"text":"This place gave me the shits, like pissin outta my ass kinda shits. I went there right after new years for a chicken club and the flatbread was stale and tomatoes were definitely not fresh like the hills of Mangolia. The smoothie was good though."}
{"text":"Beware of the wait.
Though this location is obviously understaffed, there is no sense of urgency from the employees that are working. Though my smoothie was good once a got it, I waited a half hour, after waiting nearly ten minutes just to have my order taken (with one person in front of me). I realize inadequate staffing isn't the fault of the employees, but there was zero recognition of the absurd wait - no \"thanks for waiting\" or anything. If I decide to come back, I will be calling far ahead of time with my order."}
{"text":"Was a regular, until today. Stood in line while they fumbled with the register for 10 minutes and then was promptly ignored while they went and prepped. Fine, don't take my money. I won't beg."}
{"text":"I used to love tropical smoothie cafe. I used to come to this location all the time and you can definitely see the decline. Came in, stood there waiting for someone to greet me, left without being greeted. It was so empty, felt weird. And what happened to their snack display where it always used to be stocked up full of chips and snacks and drinks. Should've taken a picture of it. There was just two bags of chips there and nothing else. Sadly, won't be coming back to this place"}
{"text":"I waited in line, behind one other person, for a whole 5 minutes... and no one acknowledged any of us in the line to take our orders, tell us they would be with us in a moment-- nothing.  In the meantime, there were about 5 or 6 employees scurrying around.  I walked out."}
{"text":"Smoothies are great, sandwiches are pretty good. They have a good smoothie/half-sandwich combo that is well priced (about $7, iirc). The prep is usually quick but it would be nice if they'd bring the meal to your table instead of staring at you blankly after you respond to them calling your name."}
{"text":"Bad service. I asked the lady if they still stamp cards for buying smoothies and says yes. I handed her my card and she throws it back to me. Not hand back she threw it back!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Experienced better but what more can I ask for! I went here after gym and got the peanut paradise with soy protein. I can't complain because it was really good. I also ordered a chicken caesar wrap which was okay. 
So you think that this place is healthy, ummm not at all. I went on their website at home to see how many calories was in the wrap and the protein shake I ordered, I immediately put the wrap in the refrigerator and only drank half of the smoothie. However, they do have shakes that are only 200 calories, which I usually get. 
The only good thing about this place is it's across the street from CSN so if you want something quick and on the go. They also have all kinds of different smoothies to choose from. If your hungry they have wraps, salads, sandwiches, and they even serve breakfast."}
{"text":"I hate to leave such a bad review because I seriously love Tropical Smoothie Cafe. This is the closest one to my work. 

The customer service is not great. The service is slow. Oh, and don't order from them with UberEATS. They'll never process it. And they never answer the phone."}
{"text":"Fair prices, good smoothies and good customer service. They're a few tables to relax and read a book if that's your thing... The scenery doesn't hurt either :)"}
{"text":"Every time we come here it's something different. Today we asked for no tomatoes on our chicken caesar wrap, and they add tomatoes. We asked for a side of dressing, and they gave us about two drops of extra dressing, hmmm thanks!! We order a peanut butter cup, and they didn't even blend it correctly. Waited in the drive thru for 20 minutes and they can't even get our order right.  
We've already decided that we will no longer be coming to this location. Horrible service."}
{"text":"It is astounding to me how a business can let customers just walk out the door because of slow service. They would rather have their customers wait 25 MINUTES for their order than to hire a second person to work a shift...DURING HAPPY HOUR!!! I just watched two customers go next door to the One Stop Nutrition because of the non-moving line. I feel bad for the employee"}
{"text":"I ordered the Caribbean jerk well and there was NO chicken in it.  A waste of time having to go back to the restaurant.  This is unacceptable."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely the worst. I must admit, I have given it WAY too many chances... only for the fact that I love tropical smoothie, and it's the only one in my neighborhood. 

Most of the people who work here look like they have either just got out of jail, or need help for a meth addiction. Which could explain the circus of shit that I hear on the speaker, and the fact that they are so RUDE and unprofessional. I pull up to the speaker today, and there is a woman laughing. She had me repeat my order 3 times, and she said it back to me.. Still laughing. I pull up to the window and a girl opens the window, and doesn't say anything... So I said, can you give me a total?!?! She said, what did you want to order? You've got to be kidding me. I said, didn't I just order and say it 3 times and you repeated me? She had a blank look on her face, like this was her first human interaction, or she was so high out of her mind she couldn't function. When they FINALLY handed me my order, it was a different woman. Her hands were so dirty, and her nails were chipped with old black polish.. It looked like she just spent all day changing oil. Needless to say I won't be eating the food I ordered, because I have no idea if these nasty people are wearing gloves. So there's 12 dollars wasted. 

Like I said this wasn't my first experience with this location, and it is my fault for going back. 

The other times I've tried to eat here, there seems to always be a problem with the speaker. It's so frustrating... The people are always so rude. They are ALWAYS out of something. You can never read the menu sign.  

Has the health inspector been here recently? I don't think the people working here would pass inspection. Who is hiring these junkies?"}
{"text":"Dirty! they have a \"B\" rating posted on the wall from the health dept.  Got my order wrong again, that makes it the last 4 out of 5 times!  Won't go back!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and probably my last.  The whole experience was bad from the start because my husband and I saw that the Soda Machine was out of order.  We weren't going to get smoothies at all.  We were there for the wraps and flatbread sandwiches. The menu has very little chooses.  I ordered a Turkey Wrap and my husband ordered a Tzaki Flatbread.  And....because the Soda Machine was out, we had to order 2 smoothies at $3.99 and $4.99 each.  With sandwiches and Smoothies, they charged me $19.30.  

We waited a long time for our order and when it came out, we only got our sandwiches.  We had to wait another 5 - 10 minutes for our smoothies.  And...they came out wrong...they were for the other table next to us, not us...so we waited another 5 minutes again for our smoothies.  Finally, we were able to eat our meals in peace.  Other tables were getting their orders wrong.  

My Turkey wrap was ok.  I've eaten better.  My husband's Tzaki was too spicy.  It's not worth the time so don't bother for this location.  There are 2 people that are taking orders and making orders.  1 makes the orders.  1 takes the orders.  30 -40 minutes for lunch is too much time!"}
{"text":"WOWOWOowow, jeeeeeeeeeeeeze. There is so much wrong with this place it's not even funny. 
So, I left an awful review a couple months ago. I wanted to show my friend my favorite smoothie place - I started going to the one on Ann because this one sucks. I decided I would just give it another chance because it's been a few months and I don't know about you, but I feel like a professional establishment should give a shit about the kind of reviews they get on Yelp. 

Anyway, the first time we went back was about a week ago. We ordered two ultimate clubs (one with no Parmesan cheese or chipotle mayo, pretty simple, right?), and some kind of berry smoothie. We got to the window and paid right away. It then took almost 20 minutes to just get two sandwiches and a smoothie. This is not okay! I didn't want to have to speak to a manager, but I asked and talked to Kai. I believe that is how you spell her name? It rhymes with Tai, I do apologize, I should've gotten the spelling. She said she was there to fix the issues with it being slow. She said come back and lunch is on her, she told me not to give up and I was super excited because I love the food and smoothies here. 
Soooo, I was feeling really good about that. She made us feel like we were going to get taken care of. 

Today, we went back to get some yummy lunch. I asked if Kai was there and she asked me to pull up to the window. She seemed kind of annoyed, but I didn't really mind that. I put our orders in and we still waited almost another 15-20 minutes for the sandwiches and smoothie(s). We had ordered one but she was nice and threw in another one. Mind you, we still didn't want the Parmesan or chipotle mayo on one of the sandwiches and we explained that. When we got home to check the sandwiches, both sandwiches didn't have the Parmesan or mayo on them. My friend found a hair in the middle of her sandwich so stopped eating it. I don't know. It was just a straight up disaster. I'm never going back to this location. Sorry for the long story, but I wanted to explain that we weren't being terribly complicated yet it still took forever and when we came back the second time, Kai didn't seem very enthused. I get that you may have bad days, but I work in a restaurant too, you get paid to have a smile on your face. If she would've apologized again for having our food take just as long, it could've made a difference. There's no point in having me come back to try and make things better by making them way worse... And doing the same thing... But why did my sandwich have to be wrong :(

Good luck, guys. You need a whole new team there. People with real motivation. I wish you the best.
We do appreciate you taking care of our lunch, but it was the same thing again. Sorry."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. Five smoothies have been made in the last 30 minutes that I have been sitting and waiting for mine. Payment system is always 'messing up' every time I am here. Always extremely slow, understaffed, and running out of food. Gave multiple tries, will not be back."}
{"text":"Waited 10 minutes to be acknowledged and another 15 minutes for a water down smoothie."}
{"text":"This location has the worst drive through I've ever seen... they are slow and the store always looks dirty"}
{"text":"Delicious smoothies. Only bad thing is that they only sell one size. I always order the island green with no sugar and it's so refreshing. I can never finish it all but still crave it."}
{"text":"I love tropical smoothie! There customer service on the other hand I don't like so much. I went to tropical smoothie on my way to work and no one was up front so I stood all by myself waiting to be helped for a good 10 mins. That's so awful. Because now I was going to be late for work. Not to mention, every time I enter Tropical Smoothie, all the people that work here are so rude and never make me feel welcomed whatsoever. Very unhappy with their service overall."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever. First one in before a rush. Last one to leave. Thanks for making me super late to work!!"}
{"text":"I am being kind today. Usually only one kid working there. Plus the turnover seems to be high. Food is good, but since service is so bad, I'm not going back till it is staffed more professionally."}
{"text":"Pissed off that it states 24-7 yet it's clearly not. This needs to change I buy a lot of smoothies and wraps a week, I'm a regular customer but that will change, I've drive twice late at night to get a smoothie and there was no one there. I'm also driving atleast 20 mins jus to get a smoothie. Poor Hospitality, this needs to be fixed ASAP."}
{"text":"Great smoothies. When it's well staffed, I get my food and drink orders right away. Other times when it gets busy, and only 1 person is working, it'll take a while."}
{"text":"They had a new really really efficient staff here today .   Great job. Drinks where prepared perfectly"}
{"text":"Drive through here all the time.  Today, a friend picked up my smoothie and brought it back to work and it was the worst smoothie I have ever had.  It was mush.  Normally the smoothies are fantastic! I called the restaurant and spoke with Denise, who was very apologetic.  She even remembered who I was as I always order the same smoothie.  She showed great integrity with offering to replace it anytime I come back and she also said she would make sure everyone else there knew about it.  
Although I did receive  a poor product today, the integrity they showed will keep me coming back!
Thanks Denise!"}
{"text":"Last time I went there I was almost done with my sandwich by the time I got my smoothie. Even though I was like 1 of 3 customers in there at the time. Aka not busy. If there wasn't so much sugar in them, I would have a smoothie for breakfast every morning."}
{"text":"I don't know if she's a manager or what, but the woman with black hair and some tattoos is a real bitch to her staff. There's only one girl in the back making smoothies during a busy morning and the manager woman starts berating her in front of customers. We left before we even ordered. I don't know her name as she wasn't wearing a tag, but in the 3 minutes I was there she had already yelled at this poor girl three times for not bringing the drinks to the customer and instead calling out the order at the counter. Keep in mind this girl had 25+ orders and she's the only one working the back. I feel for her. The manager woman is a total bitch and should have been fired on the spot for her treatment of staff, let alone in front of many customers.
UPDATE: She's not a manager, her name is Lizzie and she was incredibly rude on the phone. Not surprised."}
{"text":"It's the shift-lead, Hannah? Do not blame the teenagers for a terrible shift leader. I guess that is why they don't call you a manager, because you don't manage anything. 
My smoothie just tasted like dirty ice today. My $8 smoothie because apparently you can only \"add\" items and not \"substitute\" them. Again, this is not the teenager's fault, the shift leader must be held accountable."}
{"text":"Normally I don't complain to this extent about hair in my food since I work in the food industry and I know it mistakenly happens. However, when an issue is addressed  from a customer to the store employees, the employees should handle the matter with above customer service. Especially when the issue involves hair which is a health code violation.   

Halfway through my first half of the Caribbean Chicken Jerk Wrap when I spotted two long strands of hair in the second half of the  wrap . Keep in mind I had yet to touch this wrap. I called Tropical Smoothie on Gilbert & Baseline to notify them so 1)it didn't happen again and 2) I could get a refund. They offered me different options from: a free smoothie next time, remake on the wrap, reimbursement, or free wrap/sandwich next
Time. I took the reimbursement which meant driving back to put the credit back on my card. When I arrived at Tropical Smoothie I told the counter guy I spoke to someone on the phone about how there was a hair in my wrap as well as tried showing pictures for proof.  He didn't seem to care to see the photo, not even concerned or apologetic. He did the transaction and then had the audacity to ask for my Tropical Smoothie Reward app where he took back the points the wrap gave.

It boggles my mind how horrible the customer service was. The hair was a minor issue which I could care less about. What made me mad was the fact that the employees could give two shits that I found a hair in my food. They clearly didn't care how their customers felt. No one ever apologized, seemed any bit concerned, or asked if I wanted to speak to a manager. Their rude demeanor and  lack of customer service gave me zero reason to ever come back."}
{"text":"I came here after hearing that they began offering Beyond Meat chicken-less strips. You can substitute this for any of the chicken dishes on the menu, from what I understand. Speaking of the menu, the one hanging behind the counter doesn't give much of a description so it made ordering a touch difficult. I chose to go with the thai chicken wrap. It was, in fact, quite good. Toasted on the outside and sliced in half. My only gripe was that one half seemed a to hold all the sauce and the other had little to none."}
{"text":"I walked in maybe for the 4th time (each time in hesitation). I was at the location at around 8pm and Robert H was working. I think he is not use to greeting people of color or saying thank you or treating me and my cousin as equally as the white family behind us. Why do they get proper treatment? Was it because we had gym clothes? I don't care if he was working alone, we didn't deserve his shitty attitude. I live by this location and I don't think it's okay for this location to be so unstable."}
{"text":"First time coming here and I got the Rockin' Raspberry and I absolutely loved it. Not too sweet it was just perfect and it tastes very fresh which I absolutely love. I will definitely be coming here more often!"}
{"text":"Smoothie was nothing special and lacked flavor compared to Nekter and even Jamba Juice. Place seemed dirty."}
{"text":"I love tropical smoothie, but ever since this location opened up by my house it's been so disappointing. Usually the wait is really long when I'm the only customer in the drive thru and nobody else is in the lobby. There should be a 0 or negative star option for this location. Their oven is ALWAYS broken. Therefore it's a hit or miss when ordering food. This morning I stopped by real quick, there were no other customers in the drive thru yet my smoothie still does not taste right. Why are things always going wrong at this location? Every other location is on point but this one."}
{"text":"I have been to many Tropical Smoothie cafes and this is by far the worst one. Horrible service and horrible food. I've walked in twice recently and nobody was even there, I waited for 5 minutes and nobody came. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"Why does it take over 15 mins to get two smoothies?? Still had to wait a few more minutes to get my other smoothie. Oh that's because the employees are too busy messing around and not making drinks. Is there only one machine??? Should not be taking over 20 minutes now. Still waiting. This store is Not worth my time."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are delicious! The tzatziki steak flatbread is surprisingly spicy and very flavorful. 

The smoothies are just okay; the one I got tasted like they filled the blender with ice and tossed in a couple of strawberries. Not bad, but unexciting."}
{"text":"First time I tried Tropical smoothie, not impressed.  I place my two orders.  One flatbread sandwich and the other a smoothie.  The food was brought to the table without the smoothie.  I assumed it was still being made.  However, it never came. I went to the counter to ask about it and no one was around.  Everyone was in the back completing drive thru orders.  I was at the register for several minutes without anyone coming out.  Finally someone came out and I was able to ask about the smoothie.  They made it then and handed it to me. By the time it was made the person I was with already finished the flatbread sandwich so we didn't even eat together.  
I don't know if I would try this place again.  Maybe the drive thru because they seem to be efficient with those guest."}
{"text":"No one came to take my order at the register for 10 minutes and it took 15 minutes for them to make my smoothie. Terrible. Not nice either."}
{"text":"I have been a Jamba juice customer for years! Recently I've been coming to this location because they do half off smoothies before 10am.  The owner has decided to flip-flop on this policy that has earned them my business.  I will not be coming back, I would much rather pay full price elsewhere!"}
{"text":"This place has the potential to be great. However they understaff in the mornings. There is one guy working and it takes about 15-20 minutes to get your order. They could really make additional revenue with additional staff. I have watched 3 people alone get out of line this morning. How many people do you think have never come back because of this? It might be a slow road up but I would believe this would be a worth while investment to add 1-2 morning staffers.

Update October 4th 2017. 1 lady working and a 23 minute wait from order to table. I've now seen two people leave without ordering and another leave because they couldn't wait for the food. When will management learn that good customer service builds good reviews and a better customer following. I'm getting to a point where I might open a Jamba Juice across the street just to not deal with this crap and end everyone's pain."}
{"text":"Third trip here...and it's my last. Three strikes you're out. 

15 minutes in drive thru for one smoothie... no other vehicles and the tip jar (actually a rudimentary plastic box) placed in front of the window to make sure we all feel obligated. I would have..if the service was quicker. Dunno if it's staffing issues or what but I'm done with this place, especially with Starbucks right down the street. Don't waste your time or money as I have, just avoid this location all together."}
{"text":"Just waited almost 30 minutes for one smoothie, they even let the guy behind me go first. He seem to be their friend so I guess they gave him priority over me, not sure I want to go back to this place."}
{"text":"Every single table was dirty, there were 3 people working, 2 weren't actually doing anything, only 3 people including us 2 were here... CLEAN THE TABLES!!! Disgusting, dirty, lazy workers. We had to sit at a wobbly table just because it was the cleanest out of all the dirty tables. And to top it off, the Asian lady was rude."}
{"text":"Came in here to use their internet because Starbucks internet was down. The girl at the counter was super friendly and her supervisor gave me the internet password willingly and didn't ask if I was buying anything. 

I've been here for 2 hours now and just tried the Chicken Pesto flatbread and it was AMAZING!

Also, their smoothies are made with real fruit and not syrup.

Yum. Totally will come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I like the other locations but would not recommend this one! Have been here several times and the place is always dirty. Tonight, they have broken down boxes laying on the counter, toilet paper box on the back counter, the bathroom is filthy and there are no paper towels in the bathroom. In addition, they have made the smoothies twice and they taste horrible!"}
{"text":"Found a piece of plastic on my smoothie, went in to complain and the poor girls didn't know what to do! Although I did get my money back finding a sharp piece of blender in your smoothie is very disturbing! Let a lone DANGEROUS! 

Contacted corporate office and I have yet to hear back.

No way I am going back, I would look past the slow service but not this!"}
{"text":"Waited 30 mins to get a smoothie. Food came out first. I finished my food and had to go up and ask where my smoothie was. It was not busy. Other people that came after me had issues waiting aswell. No organization. No sense of urgency. 2 people working making food??!  1 person working drive thru and doing smoothies. Poor service."}
{"text":"Just got the food. Wasn't good at all. Got The buffalo chicken wrap. Chicken tasted plain and was very chewy. But they did give me a free bottle of water."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fruit smoothie with real actual fruit and not concentrate with syrup or whatever other kind of fictitious items they put in their smoothies, stick to Jamba Juice. Sugar overload!"}
{"text":"Do not even enter the drive through unless you have a minimum of 30 mins available to be trapped in it. Very consistently slow and disinterested service. I tried them out multiple times over the years but I will never be back here again."}
{"text":"I was really excited when this opened because there aren't very many fast healthy options in his location but, was very disappointed. The service is slow. They're understaffed and unsupervised. And the view into the restaurant from the drive through window is awful. It's a mess."}
{"text":"Maybe a little understaffed at the time. But very polite employees. The store was was clean. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place really needs to reconsider what kind of employees they have working late night. I pulled up to the drive-thru 12/5 around 130a and the supposed \"supervisor\" denied me service. He just kept telling me \"No you gotta go\" I was really confused but I guess they just didn't feel like working. Management, if this is the case with your employees don't bother being open 24h then!"}
{"text":"So I ordered a lean machine from this place and when I left I started to drink it and it tasted like someone put all kinds of medicine in the drink it was so bad it made the hair on my arms and neck stand up and made me get shivers from drinking it. So i mixed it around a little to see if that would help and it didn't at all. I wasted money on that drink cause I had to throw it away due to it being so bad and nasty. I will never order a smoothie from this place again it was so bad and disgusting. It makes me want to throw up. DO NOT ORDER THE LEAN MACHINE FROM THIS LOCATION EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food but the young staff can never get any to go order right. They are too busy talking about their social life"}
{"text":"Healthy staff plus they make it good and nice friendly service.  If you want to see all the silicons of lakes area visit here:)"}
{"text":"If you ever get text message alerts from tropical smoothie, do not expect to redeem any sort of offer here. Every time I come in here there is always some reason why they can't accept it and it seems like the owners are just extremely cheap."}
{"text":"I've been going to this location since my junior year of high school. I wish the employees would have told me about the stamp card service because by now I would have had a few free smoothies under my belt lol. The service is hit or miss and some of the employees there can't make a good smoothie to save their life but some of them are actually quite good at their job! No hate/blatant disrespect  intended I'm just being honest! I won't name any names. In my opinion I think it is best to go there in the mornings rather than night time. I am writing the review to mainly show how disappointed I am that the watermelon mojito smoothie has been discontinued. That was legitimately the best smoothie that I have ever tried from tropical smoothie and it sucks that it has now been  discontinued! Here's hoping that they bring it back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I missed the happy hour.  Hell, I didn't even know there was a happy hour at this joint.  I got in at 3:30pm, so I guess I missed it by a half hour.  Damn it!  Cheap bastards like me hate wasting money especially when it's just 30 minutes away!

Tropical Smoothie is like any other fresh fruit mixer except that they actually serve food.  I didn't have any of it as my stomach probably could not handle anything except a smoothie since Vegas nights pretty much destroy any appetite you have.  If you don't know what I'm talking about, then you don't know how to party.

The smoothies are good, they're large and you won't feel ripped off.  Except when you're a cheap bastard like me and you wish you had come to happy hour instead of paying full price."}
{"text":"I usually order Mango Smoothie (mango and sugar only). Great serving size. I like that this branch has a happy hour 4-6 p.m. buy 1 get 1."}
{"text":"If you enjoy spending 10 mins in drive thru before you order you meal this is your place.  After I ordered my food. It took another 10-15 mins before I got to the window and go my stuff.  Very very very bad customer service."}
{"text":"Worst service ever ! Every time I would go there  it wouldn't get  better .last visit was it for me .it took me 30 minutes to get a smoothie that my mother in law walked in like what is going on . Oh did I mention i was the only other person in there Sad because they have really good smoothies and food but no matter how good the food is receiving bad service is just not with the visit."}
{"text":"This tropical smoothie cafe location is the worse!!! I ordered a smoothie and had to wait 55 minutes to get it!!! There was no AC inside and the weather was 112 degrees. The guy at the cashier left and the only person inside was the guy making the smoothies. There were a whole bunch of people waiting to order and no one was there to help them. People who came 30 minutes after me got their smoothies first. It was a HORRIBLE experience. I will never come back to this location. The place was soooo dirty and stinky!! Save your money and time and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst tropical smoothly cafes I have been to.  It takes, almost consistently, over 20 minutes to get a smoothie, no food.  If I take the time it takes to go to a different one it will be twenty minutes anyway, so I guess I'm screwed."}
{"text":"Tropical Smoothie Cafe did a phenomenal job catering our party. They came and set up everything fast and professionally. All of the food was deliciously fresh! Our guests loved all of the options they provided. We will most definitely be recommending them to anyone looking for catering!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and great selection of food and smoothies!  Owner is so helpful and accommodating."}
{"text":"I love fresh juices and smoothies, even better if it was organic, but this place isnt organic. They make smoothies only (no juices) and some food. They claim that all their fruits and veggies are fresh except for the peaches , I guess they use canned peaches :/  They have one size and the smoothies are $4.99. I guess they put sugar in all their smoothies except for a green one and another on. I ordered the green one, it was pretty tasty. However the girls working their seemed bothered by my questions that I asked tonight because I have never been there before and wanted to ensure I was getting a no dairy and no added sugar drink. They were a bit rude too, someone probably should talk to them about customer service."}
{"text":"i went in before i had to take my son to get his pictures taken next door at 9:40 am and i have time to waste so i saw they were open, i saw poster they had for an avocolada something like that so orderd best thing ever!!! so fresh, servie was good, they were friendly, cant wait to go back, wishe there was one closer to were i live!"}
{"text":"I was excited when this place opened close to my work,  especially with a 24 hour drive thru,  however, the excitement wore off quickly when I realized that the service in the drive thru is slow. I have tried going at different times and it always takes a minimum of 20 minutes to get my order. If I pull up and there is more than one car in line I leave. Tonight I ordered a King Caesar wrap with no tomatoes and when I got back to work to eat it was filled with tomatoes.  I didn't have time to take it back because it took 40 minutes the first trip. I have given them several chances hoping things have improved when I've gone back but after today I won't be going back."}
{"text":"They were having a bad day today and kept taking forever and kept getting orders wrong.but I don't usually have a problem here."}
{"text":"2nd time being here, I pull up to the drive through speaker and no one is there after about 3 mins I pull up to the window and continue waiting, I was about to leave when the same man from last time opens the window saying he was in the bathroom... I order my drink and after w little while I get it. As in driving home I notice there are things in the drink that are hard and not chewable. I thought maybe they were seeds or something but when I got home I inspected the pieces and I found a little part that was not anything that was supposed to be in the drink it was a little purple shard of something, felt like little rocks when I was drinking my smoothie... It was somewhat sharp too. 


Not the best... Customer service is poor... Our order was not done the way we asked. We got two smoothies unsweetened and when we got them they were both sweetened... We went back and when we told the guy over the speaker he just said ok. The smoothie was done right the 2nd time, but it is irritating having to drive back."}
{"text":"Love this location! The place is so spacious and it feels very relaxing and comfortable being in the place. I used to come here a lot before I moved and I never had problems here, not one! 
Today I came in for the chia banana boost that I got a text for it being $1.99 so my husband and I came in and the cashier was talking to the people sitting at the table behind us so after chit chatting with them for a while he finally greeted us and took my order. I gave him my order and then he went to make it and I looked at my receipt and it didn't say what I had said which was unsweetened so I asked him to make sure and in a barely audible voice he said yea. Ok so the cashier wasn't the friendliest, but he did make it fast, which is why I give it a 3! No complaints on the time it took for us to come in and get out! Specially since we were in a hurry to get somewhere else."}
{"text":"The food here is both healthy and tasty.  A winning combination for most people.  Service is spotty.  The restaurant has a good atmosphere; they play oldies music. Great alternative to Rascal House and Qdoba, the restaurants flanking it."}
{"text":"It's pretty good, I got the blueberry bliss and it was pretty good. The fruit tastes good, hard to pick out the different types in the smoothie (it has blueberry, banana, and strawberry) but it is nonetheless very good. 

The smoothie tastes nice, and it has a good balance of ice that doesn't make it too thick or thin. I'm sure the fruit was fresh by its taste.

I'm sure to stop by again if I get the chance."}
{"text":"The food is always good here and so are the smoothies.  The wait times are pretty ridiculous though. Everytime I go to this drive thru it is a avg of 20 minutes."}
{"text":"I love their smoothies. This is the closest location to my home, which is nice, but unfortunately the customer service here is sub par and there have also been several occasions where they were out of several ingredients to make smoothies (i.e. strawberries, peanut butter, kale, etc.). I don't know how you can expect to run a successful business when you are constantly out of product and cannot even get your deliveries in order. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I think 6.50 for a smoothie is expensive.  But, I got one from there and I got a small cup to split the smoothie.  So the smoothie only cost 3.25.  That makes it a much better deal.   

This place is a run of the mill food court mass production smoothie joint, a generic mall type place, but I am giving it 5 stars because the staff was nice, and my smoothie transaction went well."}
{"text":"I go to Tropical smoothie not expecting much. They blend smoothies or wrap microwaved eggs in a tortilla. There is nothing difficult about this level of service. However, when your business model is servicing customers who walk in he door and approach the counter, you would think someone would be there to greet and take orders. Apparently not today...
I read another review that was written at almost the same time I was there today with the same exact issue. When someone finally came to the front to take my order, the ONLY thing that was said from him was, \"did you need a copy of your receipt\". I could go on about how I've been in customer service for years but we've all hear that speech. How about the speech where basic communication is necessary to complete a transaction. 
This guy they had working today is going to single handedly out this location out of business. The word will get out eventually and customers will start going somewhere else for microwaved eggs. 
The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the Chia Banana Maxx smoothie is amazing."}
{"text":"they need to work on their customer and speed in service. Both times my daughter and I came right before lunch, it took 15 minutes before they took our order and 7 minutes to get our 1 smoothie order."}
{"text":"Seriously not good! We ordered fruit smoothies thinking they would have real fruit in them. These smoothies taste like sugar sweetener and fruit syrup. The only reason we went here is because my daughter is pregnant and graving a real fruit smoothie. Skip this place...we couldn't even manage to drink half of our smoothies."}
{"text":"I want to say that the detox smoothie is the bomb. It's soo good that I come back everyday to get one. Now, on another note. There has been a change to this store. It has a new store manager and his name is William. He is so freaking awesome. You can see a difference in the staff there and the store has done a 180 turn around since he has come on to this location. Right choice for a store manager. Can't wait to see what else he does for this location. I'll always coming back to the location. The team there is awesome. Friendly, keeps everything clean. But, watch out for charisma she is very rude. Always ask for William. He is the best friendly and most of all out going to all the customer that come in. Nice job to the owners of this location."}
{"text":"Good Prices before 10am as all Smoothies are 50% off! Smoothies are made pretty good, nothing to complain about. Wraps are good too. Customer service just isn't all there, as they are just \"there\". They get the orders done but nothing more than that. Could use more cleaning in the area too. Only two napkin racks in the whole place too. Been there multiple times in the last few weeks. Was hoping for more."}
{"text":"Very slow drive through, it took almost 20 min to get just two smoothies. I asked for no banana in my smoothie, which had to be remade because it had banana in it."}
{"text":"This morning my friend and I got a smoothie and it took literally 20 minutes. There was a couple in front of us and about 4 workers in the back. I also ordered a 1/2 sandwich with my smoothie and it came 15 minutes after my smoothie. They gave me a $5 gift-card to compensate for waiting. When I opened my sandwich there was a hair. I immediately lost my appetite. Tropical smoothie used to be so much better than this. I'm disappointed in the quality of the food and the production of the workers."}
{"text":"Grew up going to this place & LOVE the food and smoothies but HATE the staff and just how incompetent the staff seems to be with small requests. On several occasions, while going in I've requested that vegetables be removed from the sandwich I order and while the same person who takes the order makes my food, she ignores this request. The staff is does not have manners, just constantly seem like they could be doing something better and when I am ordering something I am bothering them. I'm sorry for interrupting what seems to be the time you gossip. No surveys available online, no contact numbers on receipts. The meal is a little pricier than most fast food places so decent customer service would be appreciated. It's almost worth it to drive the twenty minutes out of my way to go to McDowell & Power. Do not go to this location if you plan on alternating your smoothie, sandwich or have food allergies, the staff just doesn't care."}
{"text":"Good smoothie, sloooooow service. Can possibly make you late for work. Sometimes counter not attended"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had. I work in the food and beverage industry on the strip, so I'm usually pretty understanding when it comes to places being a little busy or understaffed.  This however was ridiculous. 

I walked in and there was a couple ahead of me placing their order. When they were done the young lady behind the counter greeted me, without looking up, and added that she would be right with me. I'm in a bit of a rush but no biggie. There were two more employees in the back that seemed to be arguing over something regarding deliveries. One of those employees then starts (almost) yelling at the girl behind the counter.  Maybe three minutes have gone by at this point and I'm still standing there waiting to order.  The girl behind the counter goes to the back and proceeds to make smoothies. Ummm ok.  By the time she's done helping the other two with that and ready to take my order I'd say it had been close to ten minutes. She apologized for the wait and kindly rang me up. I really wanted to walk out but had wasted so much time there that I couldn't afford to try stopping somewhere else. When my order was ready the angry girl from the back sort of tossed the smoothie on the counter. Guess my presence upset her too? Lol

I understand being busy but in a place like this the customer should never have to wait ten minutes to order while the cashier handles other business.  For this reason I will probably never come to this location again, even though it is the only on near me. But the smoothie was decent!"}
{"text":"Acai berry boost...delicious!!! Quick friendly service. Open 24 hours"}
{"text":"I work in this shopping center , and I always have the worst experience here . I try to eat here every once in a while , thinking my experience will change because there's always new employees , but same thing , I'm always waiting 20+min for my flatbread because they forget my order and attended other orders and I spend my whole lunch here waiting for an order that should take 5 min . The cashier was really nice , her name was justice     , and the \"cooks\" name was hailey. I don't know who's fault it would be but that was my experience . And no discount was offered  , no apologies nothing ."}
{"text":"I used to come here for lunch and decided to get a Chai banana smoothie.  The guy who was originally helping me, informed me it was a seasonal smoothie however could make a banana peanut butter smoothie.  I was totally fine and happy with my order until the Manager comes to the cashier and makes a HUGE scene.  He literally yelled at the guy making the smoothie, telling him he can't make the smoothie and to drop everything.  The Manager has no professional skills at all and made it EXTREMELY uncomfortable as he yelled at his employee.

I cancelled my order and left the place, never again!  I take it making a banana + peanut butter smoothie needs to be approved by corporate in order for these guys to make it.  The Manager at this location is totally rude and has no customer service skills at all.  Seriously, what smoothie place doesn't make or customize a smoothie/drink to the customer's liking?  Good luck staying in business!  

A few locations I highly recommend besides this place - Nekter Juice Bar, TeaStreet, Pomegranate Cafe, and Bahama Bucks!"}
{"text":"The smoothies are great, I ask for no sugar because they put a quarter cup in. sandwiches are taste but they microwave the chicken. sometimes they are under staffed and you have to wait a while so give yourself time."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service there! Pretty sad, I use to come in there all the time and get a smoothie and chicken wrap, thought I would stop In And get one today. All (3) employees watched me come in and walk up to the counter. NOT ONE of them made any effort to come up to the register and take my order! I stood there while they kept doing whatever they were doing, knowing full well I was standing there! I stood there for a full 5-6 min and finally a girl with tattoos came up and asked me what I wanted. I said, \"DO YOU ALWAYS LEAVE YOUR CUSTOMERS STANDING UP HERE FOR THIS LONG, NO WONDER NO ONE IS IN HERE!\" I turned around and walked out! I took my business to DQ!!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. I just got a hummus veggie wrap and it didn't even have any hummus in it. It lacked any flavor at all as it was primarily made of lettuce, some beans, some rice, a few tomatoes, and a piece of cheese. Never visiting this location again."}
{"text":"I love the mango magic flavor here! Their wraps are also really good. Great place for the summer. Staffs are helpful."}
{"text":"Amazing - the slowest service EVER.  Great smoothies - but the worst service.  Waited 12 minutes for ONE drink.  CRAZY! Absolutely no urgency - management seriously needs to improve on the way they do business.  Unacceptable."}
{"text":"To get your food/ smoothie is about 30 minutes and has been EVERY time I come! Whether if its by drive thru or grtting down. Don't let the fact that there's only a few cars infront of you fool you! I come because the food is good but seriously with this heat it makes me think twice about coming back! The wait is just ridiculous!!!!"}
{"text":"So sad when you have employees that don't know a single thing about where they are working or what they are doing. Flyers, cards, and promotions all over this place advertising to get $5 off by downloading the app. I asked how does it work. Do I have to order from the app or do I scan the receipt? What? Girl looks at me blankly and says I don't know and walks away. Well, what do you know because judging from your appearance and lack of service....You obviously do not know much of anything....and yes you are in the service industry."}
{"text":"I love Tropical Smoothie! I moved here a year ago, from Hampton Roads, VA. I was already a devoted customer that was accustomed to stopping each day at one of the multiple locations that were available to me. I was thrilled to discover Tropical Smoothie in Tega Cay. I stop every morning. I recently was back in VA for a week and realized that the location in Tega Cay is by far the best one; due to extra care that is given each day when I call my drink order in. The staff is top notch and go out of their way to make sure your happy. I feel like Norm or Cliff from Cheers when I walk in the door because they know my name and take the time to interact and ask about your day. I recommend purchasing \"The Flip Flop,\" it goes to charity and you get a discount of 10% off  on future purchases.

{"text":"I love this chain and was very pleased to know they put one closer to us. However this location needs some work. When I walked in it was silent inside and I was the only customer. A employee came out from behind the bar after a few minutes of cleaning or something. I felt sorry for her because she looked bored out of her mind and obviously did not want to be there. The smoothie was delicious as always, but it did take almost 10 minutes after I placed the order. Its hard to fork over 7$ for something this simple when you get this type of service. This place definitely needs more energy and fun, the employees would be happier and more people would want to visit for a treat."}
{"text":"So I've only been here like 3times. The first time I ordered a wrap and it wasn't until I pulled up and paid and getting ready to leave after they handed me the wrap that they told me they were it of the type of wrap I wanted so they put it in a different type of tortilla. The 2nd time things went pretty smooth. The 3rd time, they didn't give me the type of bread I requested or that came with that type of sandwich.

The staff is super friendly and the smoothies are great but man the food can be hit or miss. Make sure you check your food before you leave. And because of this I won't ever add any supplements because who knows if they forgot or not to add it and The customer ends up paying for it."}
{"text":"Slow service!! Only 1 person in front of me and took 40 min to get my items! 
Flat bread was extremely soggy. Over priced macaroni salad in a small plastic container. My smoothie was watery. Overall I definitely had better at different locations."}
{"text":"This is the worst topical smoothie I have been to. The employees aren't nice and they weren't busy and they made the worst smoothie ever. $12 for 2 smoothie that taste terrible and don't have all the ingredient is the worst. I will never come here again."}
{"text":"Great service, decent price, small portions...

I ordered hummus, pesto and veggies on flatbread, it was tasty, but I had garlic breath for the rest of the day afterward.  Passable for a fast and inexpensive lunch, but not something I would seek out."}
{"text":"The employees seem afraid or unsure of how to talk to customers. Very strange. They take your order and the food comes out, but they barely smile or say much else. My biggest pet peeve is the grilled chicken on the salads. The meat is saturated with an oregano-based spice mix that is way too much... like they poured a few bottles of spices into the meat. Other than that, the rest of the menu is okay.... just okay. I've lived nearby for 2 years and have only been there about 6 times.... I keep thinking it will get better. It hasn't."}
{"text":"I gave it 5 stars just because I didn't have any issues. The cashier gave us time to think about the order and I didn't feel rushed. The food and the smoothies are delicious. I also got military discount so that's good.
They have good healthy choices that seemed very appetizing. The smoothies are all low fat. Hawaiian Breeze, Mango Magic, and Pineapple Delight are the smoothies that I've tried so far and they're all good."}
{"text":"My smoothie tasted like old fruit, absolutely not fresh and all the products are pretty much hidden so you can't see how horrible it looks, 6 bucks down the drain"}
{"text":"This place is right across the street from my work. I started going there because I remembered that they have huge and delicious Chicken Caesar Wraps . I went inside to order and waited longer than my entire lunch half hour for my order. There seemed to be only one girl working and she was doing her best to handle the drive thru and the inside customers. 

2nd time, I went through the drive thru, got my big chicken Caesar wrap and went on my way. Perfect. I eat half of it and save the other half for lunch the next day. That makes paying this much not so bad. I don't get super full off eating only half, but I'm trying to not eat a ton for lunch. 

Fast forward to today, I pull up to the drive thru and sat for a good solid minute before I was greeted. Was told I'd get my total at the window. No problem. Gave my card and paid the $7.54 after tax for the wrap that comes with a little cup of macaroni salad (the side I picked). Upon getting handed the bag, I immediately noticed the wrap seemed small. I get back to the office hoping I am wrong and it's bigger than I think, ready to put half of it in the fridge for tomorrow. Nope, I was right the first time, the wrap is mostly tortilla and there's very little lettuce in it. I would suppose it had the correct amount of chicken though. It was very skinny and barely measured 6 inches. 

Pretty disappointed . I guess I'll go back to getting a footlong from Subway for $7.82 after tax including avocado and bursting with ingredients. I get stuffed off 6\" of that and it's only $3.91 per day when you split it. Even Jason's Deli is a better value for your money if you are looking for a sandwich type of item for lunch. I'm willing to pay more for something when it's really good, but there's no excuse to skimp on ingredients when it's just lettuce.

P.S. They always take a while to serve you even though you may be their only customer. It makes no sense at all. Everyone who works there is like 16-19 (19 may even be pushing it. Seriously.) Where is the owner of this franchise and why don't they care to FIX THESE PROBLEMS??"}
{"text":"VEGAN Beyond Meat chik'n is now available at this and every other location nationwide.  Finally there's a \"fast-food\" restaurant that doesn't just offer a bowl of lettuce.  Had the Thai Wrap.  

PROs: Beyond Meat was hearty and just the right texture.  Sauce was spicy with a kick to it.  Crunchy with the romaine & wontons.  Liked the julienned veggies as well.  
~~ 5 stars for the partnership

CONs:  Really really salty - 1400 mg of sodium without the Beyond Meat.  Add 360 mg for Beyond Meat.  That's SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT of the RDA for sodium.  All in one little sandwich.  Obviously this is an place I'll go to only if there is no other option for food (like in the middle of nowhere).  A bit small for the price, but hey, I'm eating mainstream (albeit salty) food! 
~~ 0 stars for the sodium"}
{"text":"Asked for a Thai Chicken wrap with Beyond Meat chik'en instead of chicken.  Asked for orange or apple as the side instead of chips.  Waited for almost 20 minutes (5 other customers after me got their food before I did).  I check the food before leaving (as usual).  

The wrap has NOTHING on it except for slivered carrots and the sauce.  The wrap is more the size of a street taco, than a big wrap.  No other veggies, no Beyond Meat.  No fruit either.  So I tell the clueless teenager behind the counter that the entire order is wrong.  She doesn't say a word, just grabs the food out of my hands and takes it to the back.  

Comes back about 15 minutes later to tell me they're out of fruit.  After threatening to walk out with a refund, 25 minutes later I get my wrap.  I complain to corporate, never heard anything back from them.  This location is OFF MY LIST, even if they were the last restaurant on earth."}
{"text":"So haven't been here in a couple years but I was hungry for a wrap and I wish I would have gone to the McDonald's in next door. So I ordered a wrap which was $8+ because it includes a side that I didn't want but is mandatory apparently and it took like forever for the clerk to open the window with no greeting just a price. I get home and the wrap is ok at best but while I'm eating I notice they left like half a damn carrot in there maybe for texture who knows but I know I will never return. Hey manager your ratings are shit maybe you should work in that"}
{"text":"This is by far one of the worst TSC in the city.  Im here at 6:30 am to pick up my smoothies I ordered on line 10 min. ago and no one is here.  Another customer is here also and we both have paid for smoothies online and no one is here...the store is supposed to be open at 6am.  Who owns this place?  I supported this business for sometime now, but now I'm throwing in the towel.  There are a few staff members here that are good, the rest are uninterested, under trained, and no sense of customer service.  Ownership/management please go walk into a Chic-fil-a and take note of proper staffing procedures, standard work in food preparation, and customer service."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food is delicious...
However, the service is terrible and the front counter/cook staff are terrible. 
Me and the wife came to meet for a quick lunch, there was only a single person in here when we arrived. We were greeted by walking in to the manager telling an employee \"you need to follow the recipe, you can't just make this up as you go.\" -lol
Now when it comes to ordering, and they're asking for specifics about your order and sides, you would assume he's ringing it up right? Nope. 
50% of the order was incorrect and some was just simply not rang up. 
So the wife's had to be ordered again, so we didn't eat together after all. 
2 stars because even tho this isn't what I ordered it was yummy as hell.

-edit. Left out that even though we are the only people here. They just chucked the food on the counter and we had to walk up and get it."}
{"text":"they have awesome smoothies.. that hits the spot... i always come by an get strawberry/kiwi smoothie after the gym... they got sandwiches an snacks so u can relex an munch on something.. they a lot of stuff u can pick from so come by an grab a smoothie!!"}
{"text":"Worst service I've received at a \"fast service\" drink place. Three workers who did not have their drink making process under control and to make the matter even worse, TWO OF THEM pulled out their phones and started TEXTING! Right in front of all the costumers who were already agitated that a simple smoothie was taking more time to make than it should have. My smoothie was more of a slushie. Terrible service, not going to that one again."}
{"text":"EEEKKKK!  Me def thinks not!  Went in Tuesday, eve, 5/2, about 7pm to grab a gift card.  Was told, \"we don't have any left.\"  I asked, \"When will you get more?\" (I could've come back next day or so).  Response, \"I don't know, I only work nights.\"  Smidgen of help, \"There are two other locations very close by, you could go to one of those.\"  Didn't offer to call to check whether the other locations had gift cards in stock.
I drove to the location by Target on Green Valley Parkway & Horizon Ridge and tried calling several times (bluetooth) on the way - no answer.  Get there and no customers, one team member behind counter with headphones on.  I got prematurely excited because they had gift cards!!!  Wrong!  He says to me as he sees me holding a gift card, \"Oh, I can't do a gift card for you.\"  UGH!!!!!!!  Are you flippin kidding me?!  So I said back, \"Really?!  So you can't do a gift card and you don't answer the phone.\"  I pretty much stormed out - went to Starbuck's for a gift card for a teacher for teacher appreciation.  Thank you, Starbucks!
WORST SERVICE AT BOTH LOCATIONS OF TROPICAL SMOOTHIE!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I come here pretty often but I was disappointed with my service last night. When my sister and I came in, we were the ONLY people in line and according to my receipt it was 9:31 when he took my order.

First, the guy didn't know to make the smoothie I wanted (totally green). 

Second, he didn't know the wifi password. 

Third, he skipped my order and made the smoothies of 4 other customers that came and called in their orders AFTER me. 

By the time I got mine it was 9:53 already.
My sister was halfway done with hers by then.

Please train your employees properly!! Why put something on the menu and not have a recipe to make it?!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I live litterally 2 mins away and it's super convenient, but they always seem to be understaffed. It takes me at least 20 mins to get a smoothie. The food and the smoothies are great but they just don't have enough staff to keep up with the people flow when needed."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and while never great, tonight was by far my worst experience. Waited 15 minutes at the front with no one there. An employee finally comes out to take my order and the orders of everyone else who is now waiting. I wait about 20 minutes realizing everyone who came in after me already got their smoothies. The employee walks to the back, as I'm still standing there waiting. She comes out, makes HERSELF a smoothie, and starts walking away again when I finally stop her and ask her when my smoothies will be done, which is met with the most confused look I've ever seen. 

She was nice and apologized, but nice cannot save the level of incompetency at this place. Does this place even employ a manager? I will not be back."}
{"text":"Tropical smoothie is one of my favorite places to go to. I go at least once a week if not more. So when I hear this one was opening up right by my house I was ecstatic. I came with 2 friends and I got a buffalo chicken wrap and a beach bum. I sat there for around 5-7 minutes and then my wrap came out. I know it takes some time to make the smoothies and the wraps. I don't care about the time but it took another 12 or so minutes for my smoothie to come out after my two friends already got theirs and another 10 people that came after I did. I asked several employee where my smoothie was and got the answer that they are making it right now. I got pissed and said something to the people working the register and they checked to see if they were making it. So not only did I not get my smoothie when I should've got it way before at least 12 other people but I didn't even get an I'm sorry. This is a new location but that's unacceptable in my eyes. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the worst location possible the 1st time I came in he charged me for something I didn't want and was to busy to refund me. I tried a second time and that was my fault.... it took over 25 min to get 2 smoothies! Shouldn't be hard for all the staff they had walking around like they don't know what they are doing or maybe it is. Never again will I come to this location"}
{"text":"I am usually a fan of this store but my experience was not great tonight the floor was filthy in the kitchen (trash, large puddles and food) as you can see when you are making your order, very unappetizing half the restaurant was closed off 2 hours before closing so if you want to sit you must choose from 3 tables. I left my keys in the restaurant not ten minutes later I went to find them and the big girl with brown hair made me play twenty questions to get them back. what a turkey. I suggest they keep there attention on keeping the place tidy at least where you can see from the front. Also no more punch cards which they seldom offered at this location while from my experience other locations offer them constantly."}
{"text":"Customer Service is terrible on the morning. There is only one person working. They need to hire more staff to handle the morning rush."}
{"text":"I love tropical smooth.  Its affordable and has great service. bring your order to you so don't have to get up. Also thwre help funds for camps."}
{"text":"I stop in here whenever I'm out of supplies at home for my usual smoothies. Great selection, super fast, and affordable! Only wish there was les sugar in my most favorite flavor."}
{"text":"I went through the drive-thru at 9:15 pm on 3/25/2013.  I was the 5th car in line.  I am not exaggerating when I say the wait was 20 minutes!  The inside closes at 9:00.  Why they don't stay open until 9:30 or 10 pm is beyond me. I have been told by others that they always have a line in the drive thru at 9:00-9:30 pm... First, the drive thru speaker is so bad, I couldn't hear the girl taking my order and vice versa.  Repeated it 3 times before she got it right.  Once we got to the window, the person taking order stepped away to help with food - she didn't seem to be wearing gloves to handle the food or wash her hands, but maybe?  Anyway, when she came to the window in about 7-8 minutes, she handed me the bag of food/3 smoothies.  I asked her if we got chips with our wraps and she said yes.  I then said, what kind of chips do you have.  She said, \"sorry, all we have our sun chips, so you can't really choose\".  Once I got home, we had 1 pkg of lays salt/vinegar, 1 cheese sun chips and 1 original sun chips.  She was too lazy to even ask us which chips we wanted and instead lied to me.  Then, I checked my punch card and she cheated me 1 punch.  Also, didn't even offer me my receipt.   We ordered 3 different wraps - none were marked, so we had to peel apart the wraps to determine which is which.  This particular tropical smoothie is definitely a 1 star as far as employees/management goes.  I will start going to a different Tropical Smoothie from now on.   There is no need to go here - there are many other choices of places to eat -- I can make a healthier smoothie at home if this is my only option.  Management needs to figure out a way to move the drive thru wait time to less than 20 minutes and fix the pathetic worker attitudes!"}
{"text":"Came here again ... walked in and it wasn't too busy.  But then after i ordered several people came in.  I waited about 5 min to get my smoothie. Then another 15 get my food. Super slow again!  Instead of making orders as they came in.  They made all the food for about 8 customers and delivered it all at once... i have no idea why.  The person that came in 10 mon after me got his food at the same time as i did.  Smh i won't be returning"}
{"text":"Great food. Prices are a Lil on the high side for grab and go food. But still great.  Wraps can get soggy quick.  Order light sauce"}
{"text":"Went right at lunchtime (1230pm) there was a line about 5 or 6 deep with 1 cashier, but it went quickly. Cashier was efficient, yet still professional, not rushing anyone. 

I got the 'get up and gogi' and it was excellent just as it always is. I noticed they did add new smoothies as well, which I didn't notice until after I ordered, so I will have to go back and try them since they sounded good.

This location is great. Staff is always friendly and they are open 24 hours."}
{"text":"Ridiculously slow service! Took 30 minutes to get an order of tacos @ 3pm. Hate to see how long it would take during peak hours. Guess that's what happens when you let a bunch of teenagers run the store."}
{"text":"This place is ran by young teenagers. You will never see an adult. So I guess that explains why it looks like shit outside. Every Time I order a smoothie from here it tastes different Every Time! And let me tell you....this was one of my first jobs (not at this location). But I know you have the smoothie recipes posted right there on the wall for you yet it's always wrong. I have resorted to getting my own blender and now I make my own smoothie or I hit up Jamba. Also watch out I hear the strawberries were giving people Hepatitis C on the news."}
{"text":"I would love to add stars, but I was never served. 1 employee was serving the only other customer, 1 was filling a couple dozen little plastic cups with protein powder, and the other was sitting at one of the tables...I guess just chillin'. I sat at the counter directly in front of the 1st two for about 4 minutes by my watch. Not a word or eye contact, let alone an \"I'll be right with you.\" 

I'd have been happy to wait longer if I knew I wasn't invisible. I don't even thing they noticed I walked out."}
{"text":"The only good thing is the smoothie. Service is superrr slow. Took 15 minutes or more at the drive thru. Never coming back to this location again"}
{"text":"Excellent service, clean location, pleasant staff ! Jojo is very dedicated and always helpful! I am stopping here for Lunch as much as I can, great healthy food."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst run Tropical Smoothie Cafe I have ever visited. The problems are numerous:

1. Tropical Smoothie offers a discount to senior citizens. According to an employee that I asked after not receiving the discount, the owner of this franchise has instructed his employees to not offer the discount unless the senior patron remembers to asks for it. This location is situated adjacent to a senior (age 55 and up) community. Since senior citizens are not known for their good memories, this owner's policy amounts to the systematic cheating of his elderly customers and neighbors.

2. According to its web site, Tropical Smoothie offers free wireless internet to its customers. The owner of this franchise has encrypted his wireless network and does not tell his employees the password. If you dine at this location and ask for the password, you will be told \"I don't know\".

3. This location is always understaffed.  I have never seen more than one employee working there. Waits of 20 minutes or more are not unusual, especially around lunch time. I have even stood at the counter for over 10 minutes before my presence was even acknowledged.

4. According to the menu, the purchase of both a food item and a smoothie is supposed to be accompanied by a side such as chips, a fruit cup or a piece of fruit. More half the times I have gone to this location, the lone employee has not offered the side. The last two times I ordered the fruit cup, it came in a tiny cup that was only half full. I have not asked whether the owner has instructed his employees to withhold the side unless the senior patron remembers to ask for it.

5. At least half the times I have been there recently, they have not had the ingredients needed to make the food item that I wanted to order.

The cost of a food item plus a smoothie exceeds the cost of most of the local buffets in this area. I have continued to patronize this restaurant because I like the food, and have hoped that the poor management might eventually improve. But now I have reached my limit and have had enough of this owner's greed. I will be dining elsewhere in the future. Furthermore, I have no use for anyone who cheats senior citizens."}
{"text":"This is the worst location ever I waited over 15 minutes only to be told they can't take my order because they are cashing out and the new employee will take my order sat for another  5 minutes at the drive thru window as it was open could hear both of them laughing and joking around I honked and still nothing at all worst place ever"}
{"text":"One of the worst tropical smoothies in town. Unfortunately it is the only one near me so its here or no smoothie. Most of the staff tend to be nice but they have incredible turnover. The management here is terrible. I believe they are two brothers that are always upset very unfriendly and constantly making mistakes. I always need to get my order fixed. Today was the final straw I bring in my punch card which was full. They tell me as of yesterday the cards are no longer valid? What is this how can you not honor a card that was filled up by you for a free smoothie.  I mean how much do one of these smoothies really cost them maybe 30 40 cents. I understand if they are stopping the program but honor the card you gave me. It is not the biggest deal but it just shows the lack of customer service. if you have to go here watch your order their cleanliness is subpar and they make a lot of mistakes."}
{"text":"The smoothies are great and I enjoy coming here on my lunch break. They get my food fast and are always very friendly."}
{"text":"Just went to this location 3 hours ago and customer service was awful.  I've been going to this place for years until recently when they brought on new staff. The new male staff are just straight up rude. They laugh while you're making and order and just cut off their headpiece and have you repeat your order again when they're ready. The staff is the reason why I will not frequent this location any longer."}
{"text":"Really appreciated the grand opening sale a long time ago. Half off smoothies on Tuesday mornings. Now they don't do it but they were generous enough to have a happy hour on Wednesdays starting at 5. Not sure if they will take that off soon but I gave most of my business because of it. I really like how their prices are a little cheaper than Smoothie King."}
{"text":"Way over priced and stupid. Been here like five times just keeps getting worse smh. Watched a female worker go into the men's room. WRONG. But I would probably still come back"}
{"text":"I go to this location because it's on my way to work. 4/5 times I go, I tell myself I won't return. I rarely have good customer service, the employees are awful, and the owner is a horrible...pretty sure he has no idea how to run a business. Tropical Smoothie is a franchise, but they should be really ashamed of this location."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! I did not get so much as a \"hello\" or even a smile when i walked in this place. Not really excited to come back anytime soon"}
{"text":"When we walked inside the environment was extremely unappealing. It had a feeling that I sometimes feel in places that makes me want to leave. The one person there didn't even acknowledge us until she was done making the other customers' smoothies. Finally when we got to order we sat down on rusted chairs and a table that was so sticky it felt like it hadn't been wiped in years.
After about six minutes we got our smoothies; absolutely pitiful. My Peanut Paradise had a peanut taste for about two sips then it tasted like muck mixed with water. 
I would not recommend this to anyone who actually wants a good smoothie."}
{"text":"Today was my 3rd visit to this location all 3 times the customer service was horrible!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I enjoyed our $4.99 smoothies today. The service at the drive thru was fast and friendly, so kudos to the young man working the window.  I had the Health Nut, and my daughter had the Acai Boost(?). Both met our expectations. The serving size is substantial. The nearby protein joints also make great smoothies but the price, the quality, and the convenience of the drive through make Tropical Smoothie Cafe a worthwhile stop. Five stars for the fact that they are open 24 hours and that you can get three for the price of two between 5pm and 7pm."}
{"text":"I love this place. I always get the strawberry beach but the food is very good as well. I highly recommend this place and hope it stays there and continues to prosper"}
{"text":"The drive thru needs better lighting. Yes, this is an upscale area, but sitting in your car with your wallet out in such an isolated spot, well let's just say I was grateful for my concealed carry permit.

The food was mediocre, at best. My wife gave me a coupon that pictured this really nice chicken miso pasta salad. But when I got it home, it was 1/2 the size of the one in the picture and was  mostly pasta. And it wasn't cheap! The only thing good is location, I stopped by after the gym (LVAC), and that they stay open late. But so does Roberto's, and their food is TWICE as good and costs less! 

I will probably only go  back when I'm in the mood for an expensive, but tasty, fruit smoothie. They have good drinks, it's true. But dinner? That's something they need to work on."}
{"text":"Worst service I ever had in my life. Idk his name but he's a grave worker who's a black guy. I tried having a friendly conversation with him and he just gave me a dirty look, then I ordered and he was texting on his phone the whole time. Then he made my smoothie and it was the worst tasting smoothie of my life. Overall this guy hates his job and shows it too well, jobs are privileges and he doesn't deserve it"}
{"text":"I don't understand all the negativity.  Never once has my items been messed up nor my cups sloppy!!  I was in there last Monday & I think I waited maybe 2-3 min for my 3 smoothies & wrap.  I specifically asked for no avocado & no tomatoes.  Dah....guess what I saw none of that sh_t & then my 3 smoothies (all special order).  Everything came out right & clean along with a warming smile from an \"Elisa\". Sometimes I think sites like \"Yelp\" are worthless, cause let's be honest, are we ever truely praised when we do good?  \"Hell no\".  I've been a server at my job for 15 yrs now & the only time I see my boss is when I've done something wrong.  \"Yelp\" consists of 92% of bitchers,  they need to start providing their job experience cause I can bet they aren't part of the customer service industry.  Had they been they would know the trials/tribulations we face everyday.  Thanks for the smile \"Elisa\" & thanks for the good food \"Tropical Smoothie\""}
{"text":"My friend and I went in to get some smoothies and a meal after boxing. We were very disappointed because our hummus wrap took 15 minutes to make and they did not even tell us it was going to take a few minutes. We were the only ones in the store!! We had to ask if they forgot it and the girl said that some other guy was going to make it but there was no guy to be found. A guy walked in and they did not even greet him. We could tell he was disappointed as well."}
{"text":"I love this location! The staff is very friendly and I love the fact that they bring the food directly to your table. The manager is also very friendly and frequently helps his staff out and actually takes those extra little steps like: Would you like regular sugar or Splenda? Also, would you want a stamp card? The latter is crucial for me since I frequently come here for lunch.

Their Veggie Hummus Wrap is amazing and I am glad that they have this option in their menu.

I usually get the Island Green, its good but not amazing. 

Their sandwiches are better."}
{"text":"Smoothies are good but you have to wait 20 minutes or more to get one! I was so excited to have one so close to the gym I thought it was a match made in heaven. Waited 9 years to finally have a tropical smoothie back in aliante and we get shitty food, and lazy staff members! Re-hire or I don't see this place lasting much longer!"}
{"text":"Wanted something quick but not a burger. Took Ree's suggestion and got the King Caesar wrap with a Sunrise Sunset smoothie, I was not disappointed. Good seasoning in the wrap and smoothie was not too sweet either. Definitely come back when I'm in town for business."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous and so is the new manager here! I love tropical smoothie but certainly not this location, how do you run out of everything and have the workers not tell you that they ran out of things for your smoothie! I realize you guys run out of things fast but learn how to stock everything!"}
{"text":"Service is slow and horrible. The kids that work there don't know the menu and have bad attitudes. It wouldn't have been so bad if my drink actually taste good."}
{"text":"Owner is so rude! She told me i was an idot becuse the food she gave me was the wrong .. I would never go here. And when I bring it to her attention she get more attitude and say some things under her breath, that I will not repeat. I contacted there head quarters over the matter. 
ALL IN ALL NEVER GO HERE! and the food was only so so"}
{"text":"This is a brand new store, it looks great. I've gone in a few times since the store opened and it always is clean and the staff is always friendly. 
The past few times there was someone new in register and they apologized, because they were still learning. 
Today I went in and Megan and Josh were friendly and got my smoothies and food out very fast. They tasted great! 

I will say I wish they had the retired smoothies at this location but the Bahamma mamma and Sunny Day are my favorite !!"}
{"text":"I went in yesterday around 10 and the staff was very friendly. When taking my order they suggested what smoothies were more popular and were patient with me when I couldn't make up my mind. Their service was speedy and I will be coming back in the near future."}
{"text":"Decided to give them another try in store. Their staff is so incredibly slow and incompetent. Watching them in the back it's pretty clear they hate working here. Expect a twenty minute wait for one order."}
{"text":"I sat in line behind two cars for literally 30 minutes. Then they gave my smoothie to the car in front of me. There are now 4 cars behind us as well. If you can't keep up with orders, from two cars, why even have a drive through? 

It looked like only one employee, if that's the case she's doing great. But whoever is doing scheduling needs to change some things."}
{"text":"I am writing on behalf of the location on green valley and horizon ridge. I am here in line waiting right now for drive through, and every time I have come, I end up waiting at least 15 min. And on top of that, there is only one person working right now and so they asked me my order 4 times and then had me drive around to the window to repeat it again because he never punched it in. Should have just made me wait. My problem is that if you can't be fast and convenient don't have a drive through. Also, hire more people so that way your customers get better service. On a side note: do not order the loaded spinach salad. It's not loaded, and it tastes horrible."}
{"text":"Always super slow service. I tried the drive through for the first time today and was waiting 15 minutes after I already placed my order before I even got to the window. I'd rather go to the food store to get my own fruit to make smoothies at home."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Went through drive-thru and waited 10 minutes. No one said anything to help us take our order or anything. Goes to show when we pulled up to the pick up, we saw the only worker in there on the phone. Seriously get it together tropical smoothie, this is unacceptable."}
{"text":"Worse customer service the employees have no personality , there rude and there's always a crowd of unhappy people pissed off about there smoothie . 45 min for a smoothie is unreal unless there picking the berrys off the bushes in the back . If they want to act miserable they should get a job at the dmv or court house . There seems to be no manager on duty . Very disorganized ! Never going there again"}
{"text":"Tropical Smoothie Cafes are not consistent. The one on Durango Parkway ran out of mango, pineapple, and coconut so there goes at least a third of the smoothie menu. This location had all the smoothie ingredients but made my hummus veggie wrap incorrectly and I didn't realize it until after I had left Vegas. I wouldn't have minded as much if they had mentioned they were out of these items but I had Swiss cheese instead of pepper jack in my wrap, there was absolutely no hummus, the lettuce was brown, and it was drenched in ranch! Two stars for the nice cashier and the matcha apple smoothie being good."}
{"text":"Just wanted to say I don't think I will be comin back here.  I mean the smoothie was good.  Only one size and its too big but besides that they didn't tell me it was happy hour and I saw the sign as I was walking out.  It was supposed to be if you buy two you get one free but when I mentioned it they said it was too late and maybe next time even though I had bought two smoothies.  They took a perfectly good chance to bring new people in and ruined it by being either shady or maybe just plain lazy.  I was taking the smoothies to my work next door for people working doubles we would have enjoyed them but instead I will definitely travel across the street to Jamba Juice!!"}
{"text":"Seriously understaffed. When calling in an order ahead of time makes no difference, then there's a problem. The food is good if you don't mind waiting. I don't blame the staff: poor planning."}
{"text":"Without fail, every time I order a detox island green at this location, they make a regular island green. The whole point is not wanting 100+ carbohydrates in my drink. If I'm going to indulge this much, I'd get a better tasting menu item. This is the third time it's happened here. It's not a huge deal, but it's frustrating when customer service is consistently crappy."}
{"text":"They. Are. So. Slow. 
I only go here because it's the only smoothie place near me. It's usually pretty good once you get the food. But seriously I feel so bad for the kids who work here because they are usually working alone - doing both the dining room and drive through. They need to step it up."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to begin with this location. I used to love coming here over Jamba Juice but now I can't say that. Today at around 11:45ish, I called this location to place a togo order. I was placed on hold which really wasn't hold because I could still hear them talking. After a good 4 minutes of being on hold, I hear someone finally talking to me. I tell them I want to place a togo order and tell them I want to do a smoothie and a half with a salad and smoothie. I wish I got names but I didn't. The girl who I spoke with didn't know how to even take an order. She seemed so confused and you can hear someone in the background yelling at her telling her what to do. I assumed she was new at this point so I let it slide. she then informed me she had no strawberries so I just said to put raspberries in it. Then I could hear in the background some lady saying \"help me do these strawberries.\" So I was confused but still said raspberries were okay. She took my number down at the end of the call. Keep this in mind. I tell the girl taking my order that I would be there within 5-10 minutes. I show up to the location and the first thing the cashier tells me is \"Our machine is broken and we can't make smoothies.\" It wasn't even a hello, welcome to Tropical Smoothie or anything. Then I said I had a togo order with a salad and she's like okay let me check on your order. She comes back to tell me my smoothie was made. So I was like okay. So I am waiting for her to ring me up when she then asks about 2 minutes of awkwardness, \"Did you order something else?\" I said yes, my salad. So she goes to check on my salad, and the lady making smoothies (I can hear the blenders going off in the back) says, \"I haven't made it yet. Tell her I'll make it when I can.\" At this point, I'm already frustrated and tell her to forgot my salad to give me just my smoothie because I am on a time limit (I was on my lunch break). She then tells me my smoothie was never made. So I'm confused because she said she had made it. I tell her okay thanks and walk out of the store mad. I then call corporate to get this resolved and the lady was so understanding and said she would send my complaint to the store manager but I just realized she never took down my personal information. Now I am here to let everyone else know how horrible my experience was. I wasn't offered anything for driving 15 on my lunch break to get my food that wasn't even ready or couldn't be made. This isn't the first time this has happened either. It sucks to because I had to go my lunch break without even eating. They at least could have told me \"hey our smoothie machines are broken or given me a heads up so I could have went somewhere else to get food. Horrible customer service and I promise you I will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"Since there wasn't a JJ around, I picked up a mocha madness smoothie at Tropical smoothie on 4/19/15. I was the only one in the store when I placed my order. The two girls working waited so long to take my order that a line formed when three more people showed up.

After I waited for an endless amount of time, I asked if that finished smoothie there was mine. They said yes, but it was \"short\". Rather than fixing the issue, they continued to make all the other orders while my order sat there. The other girl answered the phone and walked away and never came back. Eventually I said \"I don't have time, I'll take it as it is.\" No apology. 

Two stars because my husband liked the smoothie so it wasn't a total loss."}
{"text":"I love tropical smoothie. Sadly, this one disappoints. My friend and I left after not even being acknowledged by the employees after 15 minutes of waiting. Bad customer service and long wait time!"}
{"text":"Slowest drive thru ever. I came specifically for a buffalo chicken wrap but they were out of chicken and I couldn't back out because someone was behind me. With only one person in front of me, I was stuck for 20 minutes! When the car in front of me finally got what they ordered, they were only handed ONE smoothie before leaving. It should not take 20 minutes to make one smoothie."}
{"text":"Great smoothies, quick service and convenient location!! Perfect place for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Horrible. Will never go back. Forgot our order. Asked for our money back after waiting and watching 3 people come in, order, and get food. They weren't busy tried to act like it wasnt their fault they forgot.refunded sandwiches and tried to make it seem like everything was ok bc we were getting smoothies as the sandwich add  on price. Terrible service. Didn't get the food so who knows if it would have been good."}
{"text":"Meth heads work here. I hope one of their teeth didn't fall into my smoothie. Omg has this place gone downhill. Obv losing money if the help is this!"}
{"text":"If I could I would give 0 star. I came in at 1:30am to get some food for my road trip. I was really excited to try this place out.
I walked in and a girl named asiaaaaa walked out with the crappiest attitude and said what would u like? I ordered the Thai chicken and she said what sides? I couldn't hear her husky voice so I said I'm sorry what was the sides again? And she repeats very slowly as I'm a child with mental issues. See I'm fair and honest. But if u insult me especially at a restaurant I'm gonna give u the worst attitude back. Other wise this place looks tropical and it's close to my house but their hiring manager need to do their jobs right as in hiring the right type of people. This isn't the type of crap service anyone deserves."}
{"text":"This location is absolutely awful. I love tropical smoothie and this is the only one close to where I work. We have ordered lunch for our staff a few times and called the order in half and hour in advance each time. However each time we went to pick it up the orders were not complete and not correct. The same two girls were working each time and were not even a little apologetic about the orders. It took them another 20 minutes to get us the correct food and drinks and by then half the smoothies were melted. In addition..they make the absolute worst smoothie j have ever had. I ordered my usual blue lagoon and there was so much ice you couldn't even taste any of the fruit and it wasn't even blended all the way I had to chew the damn thing. Disgusting. I will definitely be calling to get the managers information."}
{"text":"Good smoothies... but, I felt screwed. I came in at 6:30 PM and bought 2 smoothies. They have supplement Sunday where I could have gotten a free supplement added in. Also, I could have gotten a free 3rd smoothie for happy hour. Nobody informed me of this and that's why I'm knocking down the rating to 2 stars. Additionally, I could have bought them individually and gotten a dollar off the second one with the coupon that printed. So, I just feel screwed."}
{"text":"Just stopped in to grab a quick bite to eat at the drive thru 8/30 at 3pm. When we ordered our food the man did not ask what side we wanted with the sandwich. The other order was a Thai chicken wrap and the man said they were out of the peanut sauce. I asked what other wraps they had and that there was no menu as the display was half gone and others falling down inside the display. He did not respond. When we got to the window and received our food after paying the lady did not say ONE word to us. This is not the first time the staff has been rude and our unhelpful. I'd advise anyone going to a tropical smoothie to drive the extra distance and avoid this location."}
{"text":"Wow! I've been to some slow drive thrus before but this one takes the cake. 35 minute wait for a smoothie and a sandwich."}
{"text":"They REALLY need to get their act together here, or this place is going to shutter its windows. I stopped by for a quick wrap while running errands. Mistake!!! I've been in line 20 minutes and I'm still waiting behind someone. They need an escape route in their drive through! I gave them a second chance. Totally regretting it now that I've wasted 30 minutes of my day."}
{"text":"I have been here twice in the last month, only to wait in line 10-15 minutes and have them tell me \"We are only serving smoothies.\" Look, I know smoothies are your biggest seller, but TS definitely advertises food. Stop advertising it if you don't want to sell it or make it! Disappointing after a 10 hour workday when you're pregnant, hungry, not in the mood to cook and don't want typical fast food. I definitely won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"We jut left the drive thru and I'm baffled by their consistently terrible service. In the past, we've waited over 10 minutes at the drive thru so we don't come here nearly as often as we used to but decided to give them a shot today. The service was quick and we were pleased that we didn't have to wait long to order. Once we got to the window, the girl handed my husband his smoothie and he handed her $20.16 (the total was $5.16) she asks if he has a smaller bill because she doesn't have any $1 bills. My husband said no and she just closed the window. My husband and I looked at each other because we didn't understand why she needed $1 when the change back would be $15 even, which can be broken down by $10 and $5 or three $5. You get the point. Anyway, we waited about 4 minutes and even started wondering if she thought we said she could keep the change. Eventually she came back and tried to hand my husband a $10 and $3.99 in change! Wtf?! My husband asked what the deal was and why she didn't give him the correct $15 back. She slams the window in mid sentence then returns and shoves a receipt in my husbands face and says \"see! I was right!\" Super hostile! It was apparent that this girl wasn't too intelligent so to make it easy on her, my husband just asked her to give him the $20 back and just charge the original amount to his debit card."}
{"text":"Today was my first time at this spot I was referred by my barber and I had a drink called  \"The Peanut-butter Cup\". 
It was good! Actually I want another! I only had a little time so I didn't order any food, but next time I will."}
{"text":"I go to this location once or twice a week at lunch time.the staff is nice , and gets the orders right except sometimes the shakes are too watery . It looks like melted ice-cream sometimes. I wish they would make them thicker."}
{"text":"Incompetence at its finest... Worth the drive to another location... The service is slow at best and the people can't do more than one thing at a time... Much less get an order right..."}
{"text":"The nice lady went above and beyond to help me get a old menu item that they no longer make I hardly ever leave reviews but was so impressed on her ability to make me the perfect wrap this place has already been my fave place to get smoothies for the last 10 years or so"}
{"text":"Their product is good,but their service is just ridiculous! The girls take for ever to take orders and to make them. And you would think with all the time they take to make them, it would be the right order. And the floors in the kitchen area is dirty. I would think that you want that area clean since it can be seen by the customers. Unfortunately this is the only location in the Lichfield, Goodyear area. It's probably why they have such shitty service. They know there is no other alternative with the same tasty products. And forget ordering online...they never get it right!"}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Tried them one time and were good.  But the last two times I've been there they are closed even though their sign says they open at 7am.  The first time they were closed I was there at 7:30 and people were inside who clearly saw me outside and did not even come out to tell me when they would be open.  I can understand not opening on time for unforeseen reasons which is why I went back again but twice in two weeks and don't even post a sign for customers? That is just bad business practice.  Of course, I'm not coming back again."}
{"text":"I really tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt because they always have one person working at nights so I assumed maybe they're short staffed? Well forget all that mess, I shouldn't be waiting 45 mins for a smoothie! An awful one at that! It had chunks of ice in it like they threw it in the blender for a couple seconds and called it a day, the smoothie was supposed to contain pomegranate, strawberries, acai and some juice.. when I tasted it, it was so bland that I couldn't even drink it. Come to find out, the guy forgot to mention that they were out of strawberries but didn't want to say anything or offer a sub for them so he just decided to make the smoothie without them, as if it would taste the same. I'm done wasting my money here. This location needs to be SHUT DOWN!"}
{"text":"Good but slooooower than molasses - hope you're not in a rush; most inefficient run counter service place ever... Need a serious education on customer priorities - there's more socializing going on it the kitchen than there is food prep.

Over 15 people waiting on food for over 20 minutes!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times. The food literally sucks. It looks like a 2 year old made my sandwich. The smoothies are not consistent either. I understand they are severely understaffed but the quality is not there. I did give them a shot, but never going back. Not worth the 8 bucks.. Sorry guys.."}
{"text":"Horrible! I used to go to a different location that was good but this one is terrible - so slow and check out the pic of my food. They didn't even put the cucumber salsa on my taco - WTH there are only 4 ingredients you could remember all 4? And the \"kale slaw\" was 3 pieces of kale and barely anything else. Next time I want tacos I'll just go to Taco Bell - that's how bad these were!"}
{"text":"This Tropical Smoothies Cafe has the worst customer service I've even experienced. 0 STARS! I come here very often because the smoothies are usually made well, and I work near by. 
However, I just stood at the counter for about 2 to 3 minutes before an employee even bothered to tell me they would be with me in a minute. After I finally made my order, it was not repeated to me, nor was I even offered a receipt. In fact, the girl didn't say anything to me - I made my order, and was asked for a form of payment. No \"it will be ready in just a moment\", nothing. I was handed my debit card, and she immediately walked away. This was about 30 minutes ago; I'm still sitting and waiting for my order, because I was actually told they forgot about me. I WILL NO LONGER COME BACK TO THIS LOCATION, AFTER A YEAR OF MY LOYALTY! ;D I literally downloaded the \"Yelp\" app on my phone just now, for the lone reason of leaving this review... I hope this helps anyone else inquiring upon the service provided here!"}
{"text":"This location needs to hire a second person. Had to cancel my pick up orders twice because they didn't even start the order. Not including the other times it took me 25 minutes just to get a wrap and smoothie. I'll drive across town before coming back to this one."}
{"text":"I like their smoothies , but the machine that make wheat grass shots breaks down alot. Im curios is it really out of service ? Hmmm."}
{"text":"So everytime I come and this guy Zach holds down the fort! This guy is always working hard everytime I come in here I am surprised they leave him alone. I really hope they pay him more than minimum for what he does at this location. Sometimes his smoothies aren't blended well enough, other than that they taste A1. Keep it up bro!"}
{"text":"Went to get a smoothie and it was watery. Not any hello when I walked in and took a few minutes before they saw that I was there."}
{"text":"Great smoothie, had the new breakfast chia banana smoothie. Great veggie hummus wrap. Quick services. I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Long wait. As soon as I walked in, the cashier warned me about the long wait. I was fine with it and he was polite, but what wasn't so appealing was the uncleanliness. No napkins, no utensils, no nothing! They don't replenish their supplies. The staff horse around in the back. Staff needs to be trained badly. They need to keep their professionalism and know the importance of maintaining cleanliness and proper functionality of the store."}
{"text":"Definitely don't go late at night. I've been there twice after 9pm and the staff is horrible. I ordered my smoothie without any added sugar but they made it so sweet I couldn't drink it. I asked it to be remade and again they added sugar. I don't understand...aren't smoothies supposed to be healthy? As I was sitting at the tables outside, some of their staff came out and sat at the next table smoking cigarettes. This is definitely not a good place to go to after a workout at the gym, especially if you're health conscious. I wish there was a Jamba Juice nearby that is open late."}
{"text":"This is the only smoothie place I even bother with anymore. I like that Splenda is an option and now that they are starting to incorporate veggie smoothies on their menu, it really hits the spot for breakfast or lunch. Plus, it seems like no time at all before I've filled up my punch card and get a free smoothie. If looking for more than a smoothie, I like their buffalo chicken wrap if I don't care about calories, and their ham and swiss flatbread when I do. ;) As for staff, I've had pretty decent service overall, albeit a bit slow at some locations."}
{"text":"Just came from this exact Tropical Smoothie. I have eaten there so many times and EVERYTIME I swear I will never come back. Their food is good. That's what brings me back but their service is HORRIBLE and the pricing to proportion makes it less compelling. The drive-thru is SO SLOW and most of the reason I swear off going there each time. There were only 2 cars ahead of me when I arrived and it took me 19 minutes to get thru. I waited 5 minutes @ the window for my smoothie after they have given me my sandwich and taken my CC. Come to find out, it had been sitting there the whole time. They just forgot to give it to me. I've tried going in and it's just as slow. Avoid this place unless you're starving to death."}
{"text":"Waited 32 min for 2 wraps. After 15 min I was told my order was coming up next... 4 other people got their order before mine. Didn't even get offered a bag of chips for waiting."}
{"text":"Slooooowest Trop Smoothie everr!!!
I frequent this location since I work in the shopping center n it's always a drag even when they r slow :/"}
{"text":"This place has an amazing variety of smoothies.Off the hook.I recommend it."}
{"text":"Went this morning around 945 am and the service was absolutely terrible.  The cashier was rude, tapped her foot impatiently, gave me sass and she obviously didn't care.  The server just talked about her boyfriend issues with the cashier out loud....I get it, we all have issues, but it was plain annoying. Lost my business."}
{"text":"I was so excited to find that Tropical Smoothie came to Charlotte. I grew up on the coast where it was plentiful. I was sad to see that my favorite wrap was no longer offered but their Chipotle Chicken Club Flatbread was very good. 

The staff was so genuinely nice and helpful as well so that was a definite plus.

I cannot give much advice on the smoothies since I always get the Jetty Junior - a smaller alternative to the Jetty Punch for those that cannot finish a whole regular smoothie. 

I can say, however, that they use real fruit in their smoothies and not just powder. The locations back home had the prep area open for view to the public and you'd always see heaping piles of fresh fruit ready to be used."}
{"text":"When my honey comes home from work, he stops by and gets smoothies for us- They taste great at 430 am! Blueberry with frozen yogurt..yummm! I'm of course a Cali girl so I'm a Jamba Juice girl, but when in Vegas....Tropical Smoothie is the place to go."}
{"text":"Thanks Nick for having everything ready after I spent 45 minutes waiting in your sister store on Greenvalley Parkway. You rock... The other place is lame."}
{"text":"So....this place has pretty good food/drink but whoever does the employee scheduling...my goodness!!! Why would you have one person making food, drinks and tending to the register??? The line gets pretty damn long when that happens!!! Poor girl who's currently running around right now...she's doing a great job though! Pay Carli C. More!!!"}
{"text":"This location is a very good spot for eating heakthy food. When the manager is present, the service is fantastic. He makes the environment what it is: awesome!

Great food, when prepared correctly."}
{"text":"They see customers walking up to the door and turn the lights off. How ever yelp says they close at 2am.. I would of never guessed.. it was only around 8:15pm on 9/15/17 and Dine in was closed, management tune to your cameras and see what I mean about the lights flickering... I will stop by soon but only to get a receipt and call management. Smh."}
{"text":"This is the third time I come to this location. The staff is very nice but there is never more than one employee at a time. This is the third time I have to wait 55 min for a flatbread and a smoothie. Definitely not coming back here. 
Ps: saving money on the staff is definitely not the way to go!"}
{"text":"Well I understand why it is 2 star rated. Employee who took my order must have been a Zombie! He looked like death warmed over and grunted which I assumed was his way if saying what would you like to order. In addition the place was not very clean, from the tables to the counter top and floor. Tropical smoothies are definitely taking a downward spiral in customer service.
I gave two stars based on speed of service, correct change and good drink. 
I probably will not be back. Jamaba juice is the way to go!"}
{"text":"Yes! I lived in San sonoma for a year and I visited here weekly! I now drive over here just to get their smoothies and the hummus wrap. Their happy hour is awesome I save the extra smoothie for breakfast the next day Big Craig is the sweetest, funniest guy, too. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I had to open up a Yelp account just to write a review about this place. Terrible, ridiculously terrible! I have given them several chances and they have let me down every time.  I have visited this particular Tropical Smoothie 7 times and each time they have gotten my order wrong. I only order one single  wrap, shouldn't be that hard. Go to a different tropical smoothie.  130+ yelp reviews with a 2 star rating,  obviously the owner doesn't care about service."}
{"text":"I so want to give this five stars, because the food and smoothies are quite good. But I've literally never waited less than 15 minutes...ever. Service is consistently slow, and not just kinda slow, but ridiculously slow. With employees sitting in the back of the kitchen on their phones. Don't come here if you're even in a bit of a hurry, or if you value your time."}
{"text":"Best smoothies around. Food's pretty good too. Try the Health Nut smoothie with Whey Protein. For food go with the Thai Chicken wrap."}
{"text":"This place is so good. Id have to say almost as good as Jamba Juice. There is a weird smell when you walk in and Idk what it is big their service and drinks as fantastic."}
{"text":"24 hour drive through ... Slow device no matter the time though . But hey at least there's on the east side right !"}
{"text":"if you're looking for fast customer service and friendly faces, do NOT come here!! i've been to this store three times and each time the employees were so rude and uncaring. one smoothie takes a good 15-20 minutes for them to make, and it takes a good 20 minutes just to order the stupid thing. the only good thing here is that it's extremely fun to watch customers come in, get frustrated and leave. all in all, absolute waste of time, horrible service, and most importantly, very poorly ran establishment"}
{"text":"Stephanie was very helpful and nice! The smoothies are always fantastic at this location. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Walked up to get a smoothie an employee asked me if I wanted to order after I replied yes she walked to the back and all three employees stared at me for several minutes, no one attempted to take my order."}
{"text":"Went here with my husband for a quick dinner and a smoothie. We got the Get Up and Goji smoothie which was really good (hence, the two stars). Then we ordered two Early Bird Breakfast Wraps, as they serve breakfast all day. I'm pretty sure there was no egg at all in the burrito and it was just swimming in the chipotle sauce. Seriously, disgusting. Also I'm pretty sure the chicken they put inside it was just quickly microwaved. Anyway, they should just stick to smoothies. I'd be okay with that. Don't have food if you don't know how to make it though!"}
{"text":"No wifi!!! Are you kidding me, ur a cafe for god sakes!!! Won't be going back until wifi is added."}
{"text":"best health food and smoothie restaurant I've been to in years!

Could use some more employees though."}
{"text":"AVOID THIS PLACE DURING LUNCH HOUR!!! I felt so bad  as they were horribly understaffed and they were really trying their best. Not sure why such a busy location would have only two people working during a weekday. Management needs to do a better job of staffing."}
{"text":"There's literally like one or two employees every time I go to ANY tropical smoothie. Food is great....but I stopped going because the service is extremely slow. Franchises need to stop being so cheap."}
{"text":"This place's smoothie is fantastic, way more variety than places like Jamba Juice and the price is a little better too. While there isn't anything wrong with the food here I just think that you can get food else where and save a bit of money. I salads are a tad expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"Smoothies were ok. Not great for a tropical smoothie. Sandwich should have been toasted but the cheese wasn't even melted. Bathroom was disgusting. I've seen cleaner bathrooms at a convenience store. Skip this one. Go to the one on Horizon."}
{"text":"Jus got back from tropical smoothie drive through (9/5/10)about 10:15pm. I ordered two piña colada smoothies , drove up to the window and waited.....  Saw 3 employees inside laughing having a good time nobody acknowledged us for at least 15 mins before I got fed up and left. Terrible customer service it was like they forgot about us , I think they did . Oh well I will never go back ,too bad their smoothies are very good if your lucky to get one ."}
{"text":"This place has the best salads and pb milkshake thing!! Go try it!! Staff was friendly and accommodating"}
{"text":"So much sugar added in the smoothies. Ordered a buffalo chicken wrap and they smothered it with buffalo sauce until it wasn't even edible. Returned it for a spinach salad which they pile up with greasy bacon. I think they are trying to be healthy but are seriously missing the mark. Service was terrible, the girl at the front looked and acted like she hated working there."}
{"text":"Smoothies are great. The food isn't the best but then again it's a smoothie joint not a food joint. They are quick in getting your order and getting it right. It's a little small on the inside so that turns me away sometimes when they seem busy. But overall love this place."}
{"text":"It's getting three stars because I absolutely love this place , but only three because they literally have one employee working here on a night shift . 7 people in line ! Two ahead of me and four behind me . They have this poor lady working all by herself with this much business !? Are you guys insane , I feel for her because I've been that situation. Having to make all the smoothies anddddd the sandwiches / wraps etc is ridiculous . She did great with my smoothies and wraps but management GET IT TOGETHER , and have another person on ! This location is always busy no reason why one employee should be working alone. Smh"}
{"text":"Love Tropical Smoothie Cafe but not this location. On 4/2/17 my friend and I waited 7 mins while a female employee counted the registers money ( it was about 3 PM) and there were no customers inside the cafe and about 3 cars in the drive thru lane. Finally,  a male employee comes out of the back and asked us what we wanted to order. When my friend told him what smoothie she wanted (off the menu- nothing special) he actually rolled his eyes at her. Needless to say we left at that point since who would want to give money to these people? The owner needs to hire new employees since the two we interacted with are horrible and losing business,  they obviously couldn't care less as to how the business fares but just want to go home."}
{"text":"Took my SIL here and we each had the \"Green Island\" smooothie (spinach, kale, pineapple, mango, and banana). They were delicious and just the right consistency. I love a good green smoothie! 

We sat inside, and it was mostly clean, but pretty noisy with music blaring, and the blenders going making smoothies. Not exactly amazing atmosphere, but the smoothies were sure good, and great for a casual get together. I would go back. 

I could see this being a good place to go with my kids because they could make a little noise, and no one would notice, lol."}
{"text":"The absolutely worst tropical smoothie
In town. They never have any ingredients to
Make anything. Please, if you live up in anthem highlands or inspirada drive to another location Because you will Be very disappointed when they can't make a smoothie that you want."}
{"text":"This place is 10x better than jamba juice, this specific location is better than the one of the strip, smoothies taste better and are alot faster. This is my #1 smoothie place, cant live without it."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Worst tropical smoothie ever. I won't be returning to this location ever again."}
{"text":"Love tropical smoothie but this location sucks!! Very rude employees that obviously hate there jobs ! To bad"}
{"text":"Love this place! The tacos are fantastic, especially the Thai and Korean tacos. Went here randomly when we were looking for smoothies and it paid off. Definitely going back for more tacos."}
{"text":"Fast service... Great smoothies... Love this place! I have been going here for about 4 years... My favorite smoothie is the chocolate banana smoothie."}
{"text":"Their Smoothies are pretty good but service is horrible. The first time I went to this place I watched one girl for 15 min as she swept mopped and bagged the trash before she took my order while the other two sat in the back and watched. On 5/12/2016 they told me they were only taking cash after i waited 10 mins for the register girl to finish bagging the trash"}
{"text":"Ive been going since it opened but it really has taken a turn for the worst. I assume the switch to 24hrs & a lot of new people has led to it. They always run out of things ex. granola, straws often. I get real inconsistency with the quality of my shake usually peanut paradise. A lot of unripe banana taste, slushy ice not smoothie like & I think they forget to put peanut butter in quite a few times cause I don't taste it only the unripe banana. I also get PBBC flatbread & sometimes it's a nice size with granola & on n banana & other times it's tiny and mostly bread. Also lately the place hasn't been very clean which is unusual from the past as well as the wait. I know a few of the managers in this area & really hope the Goodyear location can turn things around. I've been to the Surprise location as well as a new location in the east valley recently & it was not only are they newer & nicer looking but how the Goodyear location used to be. Hope this gets fixed or I'll just switch to making it at home."}
{"text":"Perfect perfect for quick lunch instead of going to fast food place, u get that boost in morning from the supercharged smoothie, grab a Caribbean jerk bowl for lunch and u stay healthy simple is that! And great service!"}
{"text":"Great food. Never been let down by the taste. Extremely slow service. There were 3 people ahead of me and I waited for over 20 minutes for a smoothie. That's just not acceptable. 

See what you can do to speed up the service. Not going to be a repeat customer unless I come at an off time and I'm the only one in line."}
{"text":"I Love this place and try to eat there all the time. But every time I go in to order a smoothie before I have to run to work the line is ridiculous. There are one or two people on staff working. I feel that if there are popular hours then they need to be scheduled correctly to have a larger staff. I am waiting for 20 minutes to get my smoothie. The issue I seem to find is either the members who work there are either too focused on getting all the orders in and then they're overwhelmed. Or are too busy doing one order at a time. Then it really takes forever. I would go there more often but have had to slow down my attendance there because they are taking way too long and I cannot be late to work. It would be nice if I could just grab a smoothie and run."}
{"text":"my go to is the island green! great customer service and amazing food and smoothies! go here at least once a week, and i love it!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Staff is slow, not familiar with things. A couple days ago I came in alone, ordered one smoothie. The woman proceeded to take the order of the large group behind me before starting to make mine, wasted ten minutes there. Went back today, got a smoothie and flatbread. Opened flatbread when I got home, took a bite, totally smelled like cigarettes. In the garbage it went, I guess they don't wash hands or wear gloves. Won't be back, ick"}
{"text":"Very disappointing first time here... I would have given more stars if they accommodated for lactose intolerant people. The cashier said they didn't have anything dairy free. 
I ended up getting the sunrise smoothie with peanut butter...
It seemed the cashier was also irritated after I was trying to add a vitamin c boost and multi vitamin because she sighed and had some kind of attitude even though there wasn't anyone behind me in line...Being that I'm six months pregnant and my first time here, it would have been nice to have had a more pleasant visit. I guess I will keep going to Robeks instead."}
{"text":"Excellent location really nice atmosphere. The only thing that i would have to say is the fact there's only one worker. Friendly people, but very limited staff."}
{"text":"It is kind of weird to go here because one of the cashiers seem to like my sister. But over all the smoothies are really good. Personally I love the srawberry lemonade smoothie. I really recommend that smoothie!"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Tropical Smoothie for many years, though we stopped going when the prices bumped up.  Now that they've seemingly normalized, like the smoothie+food combo being reasonable, it's an option back on the table.

This location is further from where we live, but the location near us (Sunset/Stephanie) is horrible.  As for this location, we've had pretty good luck.  Yes, it's run by teenagers.  But the last time we visited, we got great service.  The girl who was working informed us that their store wasn't working with the Rewards app yet, but she took good care of us in lieu of that.

Previous visits have involved a longer wait, but when we popped in most recently, it was a quick trip in and out for a wrap and a smoothie.  If you go at the height of lunch hour, they'll likely be a bit backed up.

My only real complaint about my Jamaican Jerk Chicken Wrap is that it had massive chunks of red onion, which wrecked the good flavor.  The menu at the store isn't very clear about what's included in each wrap, so you may want to visit their menu online for the full rundown.  

And my Mocha Madness smoothie was delicious as always.  Try the Bahama Mama too!"}
{"text":"I've been in love with Tropical Smoothie for quite a long time.  We've had good experiences at the location up on Horizon Ridge but it's quite a drive from our place, whereas this location at Sunset/Stephanie is within 5 minutes.  We tried to convince ourselves it'd be ok.  \"Yeah, they have a C health rating with an astronomical 33 demerits, but they were just inspected, which means they'll be on top of it, trying to get bumped back up to an A!\"  \"Let's just pop in to see how service is.\"

Let me save you some time: AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE.  My wife and I went in this past Sunday to order a smoothie to share.  My wife noticed the sign on the wall advertising Supplement Sunday, where you get a free booster mixed in if you order a smoothie between certain hours.  We asked the cashier and he had no idea.  He strained to read the sign before engaging in a shouted conversation with an off-duty employee sitting at a table.  Oh boy.

Once he got that figured out, he put the order in.  There was one girl in the back, which is in full view of where we were standing at the counter, who was making smoothies.  The cashier was wearing food safety gloves; the girl actually making the drinks? NO GLOVES AT ALL.  We watched as she grabbed the fruit with her bare hands (I still pray they were clean) and put it into the blender.

At one point we became aware that they were out of a certain kind of cup and that the lids were having trouble fitting on the replacement cup.  We were aware because they were having a very audible conversation about it.  The cashier comes out and politely tells us the situation: we can either get the smoothie in a big cup with an ill-fitting lid, or split into two small cups, though it'd be the same amount.  That was perfect for us, since we were splitting it anyway.

He goes into the back to let her know and she belligerently begins to chastise him, \"DON'T TELL THEM ABOUT THE SMALL CUPS.\"  And they have an exchange wherein he tries to tell her which smoothie to split and she continues to go, \"WHICH DRINK?\" and \"THE ONE I ALREADY MADE!?\"

She pulls out the two small cups and doesn't fill them up all the way, leaving a gap atop each cup.  She then promptly throws the rest of the smoothie out.  Uh, thanks?

It's a shame that there's no quality control between locations of this brand.  In an ideal world, this location would get new management and become a place that I would frequent.  In this world, I hope it closes immediately."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Waited at the counter for 5 minutes before anyone even acknowledge I was there. This place was run by young kids. I didn't see one responsible adult in there. Finally after 10 minutes I got my wrap then had to wait longer for my smoothie. This location definitely needs a lot of improvement before I will go again."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing place. A very small space but it works for them. The smoothies are large and delicious. They also have a pretty big variety."}
{"text":"Beyond disappointed. I'd give this zero stars if I could. I now know why these are going out of business. Food isn't fresh at all. Especially the salad I received. There shouldn't be any rotten greens in a salad. Ever! More black leaves then green leaves. Wow this is straight up common sense. Didn't see anyone being served moldy flatbread but I would put it past this joint. Won't be back... EVER!"}
{"text":"f#cking slowest shi++y service -- ever!!! And it's expensive!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. The cashiers have the IQ of a stump. Waited 20 min in line and left b/c cashier looked at me with vacant idiotic stare when I told her the wait was RIDICULOUS!"}
{"text":"This place sucks. They don't even deserve one star. I've been waiting for my order for over 30 minutes and I'm the only one in the store and there's no one in the drive thru. There's 4 people working and they're not doing anything. The tables inside and outside are absolutely disgusting, the trash was piled up and it's so gross."}
{"text":"First and last time i throw away $14 For a mediocre smoothie and average wrap. The employees were rude and didn't even acknowledge me for some time. The entire place is dirty, I don't know why I even decided to stop here. I don't usually review places but their terrible service prompted me to make this review as I'm sitting in my car forcing myself to have a tasteless smoothie that cost me $8. It's definitely not a place I'll visit again."}
{"text":"Bought me a smoothie yesterday and thought it was really watery.. it's like they put an excessive amount of ice with the mix to where thats all you can taste,ICE!! So I gave them the benefit of the doubt and tried again today. Ordered a get up and goji and a kids smoothie. Both were really watery!! You can't even taste the fruits! I would not recommend this place. At this point a smoothie at McDonald's(located next to it) would be better and their stuff is pre made. Don't go here unless you enjoy ice with a slight flavor of some kind of sweetness.. very disappointing. Where's a Jamba Juice when you need one?

Ps. Train your employees to not add so much ice to stretch out your products. You'll end up loosing a lot of customers to McDonald's."}
{"text":"Food and smoothies are delicious. My only complaint is the drive-thru is extremely slow."}
{"text":"Ordered the turkey and gaucamole sandwich and the papaya smooothie for $6.99. Such a great deal and the smoothie was HUGE! Everything was made fresh and tasted so good. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't deserve any stars! Long wait, ordered two smoothies and a wrap. After one smoothie was made, the employee asked if I wanted one after I already made my order for two smoothies; Which didn't make sense. My food was sitting out probably 10 mins before it was wrapped and given to me and it took about 10 mins to get my second damn smoothie. Terrible service and definitely understaffed. Changes definitely have to be made at this location. Horrible."}
{"text":"I don't mind this location too much. It's small and the staff is small so when there's a wait I can understand why. Staff is always nice! The only thing that I don't like is that it closes at 9:( I guess that's my fault for eating late!"}
{"text":"This location is very slow and they don't greet you when you come in. They just stare at you. (It's super awkward) The smoothies are pretty alright. Not bad, but not anything super exciting."}
{"text":"This place had the slowest drive-thru I've ever been in! And the people are so rude! I love the smoothie but it took so long just to order."}
{"text":"Normally I don't do yelp reviews but my experience here was unfortunately bad. There was nothing wrong in particular with the food.The cashier was very kind and patient and took my order with no problem. On the other hand, all I could hear was the manager screaming and yelling at her employees and customers. Employees did not talk back and It was very distasteful. Just for this reason, I wouldn't recommend going here. Please do not support businesses where the employees are treated like trash"}
{"text":"Smoothies are great, food is good,  customer service sucks. No one in the place knew what they were doing"}
{"text":"Jerk salad is small and not good. Maybe try a wrap? I am sure this place is best for wraps and smoothies not salads."}
{"text":"Always super nice employees and it's something healthy. Even when busy, they work really hard to hurry and get your order ready."}
{"text":"I get the acai berry boost and is amazing.  The sandwiches and the flat breads are good too."}
{"text":"The smoothies are delish, the food is okay. The smoothies are tasty and full of fresh produce, everything you thought Jamba was when you were a kid, and most likely until you stumbled across this legit smoothie joint. Plus the smoothies are HUGE!!!"}
{"text":"Smoothies are good, food not so much. I got a salad and the entire thing was inedible. Slimy lettuce."}
{"text":"My personal experience with this particular tropical smoothie is that their policies are different from any other tropical smoothie."}
{"text":"Disappointment doesn't begin to describe the food, the service or the cleanliness of this location.
We ordered the Spinach Salad, add grilled chicken. It is advertised with raspberry vingarette. We received a yogurt ice creamy dressing. We asked for the proper dressing, they didn't have it. The salad had syrupy canned peaches-what! That's a healthy salad?
More importantly, the employees, the new kid, who has been here for 2 weeks was nice, the others, why do they have jobs?? I went to the counter to tell them the table was dirty. He handed me a roll of dry paper towels and told me I could go in the bathroom to get them wet - really??
Why are snot working? Why was I charged for inferior food? Why is their no manager who hasn't fired the fools? I hear people want jobs, there should be  two openings here tonight!
I hated to give them one star, they are really bad. CORPORATE they are ruining your brand!!"}
{"text":"Don't buy anything from Sabrina. She offered me a pre-made smoothies and she put it back to the fridge when I said No to her. Plus you expect unfriendly service. Attention to the Manager/Owner please check your camera. It happen around 9:45pm."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible attitudes. It looks like they're all pissed off at the world. Extremely slow. Looks like they have plenty of time to gab with each other back there though. I've never seen employees move so slow. They should close the store down."}
{"text":"I love their smoothies, but this place takes forever every time I visit. A solid 20 min.. I finally got my smoothie after someone grabbed it and took a sip. They had to remake it, taste like pure crushed ice. $6 bucks wasted.."}
{"text":"The smoothies are delicious and the breakfast wraps are amazing.       very high quality.  Especially the all green smoothie, peanut paradise, unbeetable berry and the southwest wrap.    plus I've had there new super grain bowls (roasted pepper) it was delicious.   The staff is very friendly and polite and they are as fast as can be.    There is usually only one worker there , so if there is several customers expect somewhat of a wait.   Especially if you're ordering food.           Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The girl ahead of me came back in and complained that her smoothie was completely tasteless. I should have taken that as a warning. My smoothie tastes like an ice cube that accidentally touched a strawberry. My three-year-old is always pumped up to get smoothies, as just about every three-year-old is, and he took one sip of his and then put it away in his cup holder. Really terrible. Not going back to this location."}
{"text":"Never coming here again!! Had a piece of metal in my smoothie!! Use to come here often but finding a piece of metal in my smoothie and almost swallowing made me rethink about this place. They found out it was one of their blenders that was barely working. That tells me that they are not thoroughly checking equipment."}
{"text":"This location is ALWAYS understaffed and it takes 20-30 min to get a smoothie...RIDICULOUS! Shame on the owner for being to cheap to properly staff this location!"}
{"text":"just drove by this location and it's apparently a Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf now... so yelp needs to update as closed"}
{"text":"I usually get the chocolate banana smothie which is always delicious. The lines can be a bit long so sometimes I call ahead and since they know me they make it happen. Perty cool Service. The also serve tacos and some other snack other than just smoothies. I am a regular at this place during the summer and I think it's just great."}
{"text":"Was there today for flatbread, wrap and a smoothie with my wife after the gym. A customer accidentally took my smoothie when they called my name. I let the staff know and the first thing she said was we are really busy so..... I said I understand I am still waiting for my food so just wanted to let you know. When our food was brought out I let the other staff member know the situation and he seemed he didn't even want to stand there long enough to listen but he have me the same answer. We are really busy so idk when it will be done. I let him know if was not my fault and I would have liked to have my smoothie with my meal. There was only a rush of under 10 customers at the time, 2-3 families. End of story if did get my smoothie while I was still eating but the answers from the staff wasn't what I was expecting. But I don't except royal treatment from teenage staff at a smoothie place."}
{"text":"30 minutes for  a damn smoothie?  Stay away if you're out for a quick lunch.  There is no reason or excuse for this at all.  Stop taking orders and help out clear the orders first."}
{"text":"I would have given this more stars because this place is really good but I do not want to come to a place where one of the employees are all over their boyfriend and then once a customer comes in the guy leaves. First off this employe is at work not home. I felt extremely uncomfortable that is not something a customer should see when they walk into a restaurant."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this location they always take forever, they never make my smoothie right I always order the same thing the peanut paradise and I don't taste any peanut butter in it I taste mostly protein. Also everyone who works there seems to always be in a bad mood and they always forget to give me my receipt I have to ask for it I have never had to do that anywhere ever. 
The location that I did love got shut down. 
Won't be coming back to this one."}
{"text":"I went to Tropical Smoothie on my lunch break and I cannot express how disappointed I am in the customer service at this location. This is my second time experiencing bad customer service here. I walked in with a friend and there was one lady in front of us. She looked like she had been waiting for a while. I only saw one employee in the store. He was working in the back preparing smoothies. He then came up to the counter, handed out the two smoothies to the other two people who had been waiting and without even glancing at the woman in front of me, he began cleaning and working on other things by the blenders. We waiting for another good 10 minutes before the lady in front of me expressed she was going to Jack in the Box instead and left. We stepped to the front of the line and continued waiting since I was really in the mood for a smoothie. Another 10 - 15 minutes went by and nothing. The employee refused to make eye contact or acknowledge me in any way. I finally grew impatient and began calling out \"Excuse me?\" to try and get his attention and he refused to even look at me, although I can't be sure he heard me from how far back he was. My friend and I ended up leaving after spending half our lunch hour just waiting at the cash register for our order to be taken and ended  up getting smoothies Jamba Juice.  I've worked in customer service all my life and cannot believe that there was so little service at this restaurant. To not even acknowledge a customer standing at the register for that amount of time is just ridiculous. This is the second bad experience I've had at this location and I am very hesitant to give Tropical Smoothie my continued business when this is how customer's are being treated. I tried to look around for the name or phone number of a store manager and did not see anything posted in the store nor on their website. I really hope this message finds it's way to someone in charge of that store because this was just  unacceptable. 

The first time I had a bad experience I had walked in and ordered food promptly (there were more employees present that time) and then proceeded to wait over 30 minutes for a caesar wrap. I had an important work meeting and had already planned to spend a certain amount of time getting food, eating and then leaving on time but because the wait for the food was 30 - 45 minutes, I ended up being late for my meeting. I went up to the register several times to inquire how much longer and each time I was told it would just be \" a few more minutes\". I don't believe I will be coming back to this location again."}
{"text":"Today at my work, myself and two other coworkers ordered some items from this tropical smoothie location. It was three smoothies and two chicken pesto toasted flatbread sandwiches. When we got our order our smoothies were fine but one of my coworkers found a hair in her sandwich when she took her first bite. 
My coworker called tropical smoothie to speak to a manager whom didn't sound at all sympathetic. The manager did offer to replace the sandwich but since she was already on her lunch break my coworker couldn't leave. So the manager took my coworkers name and number and promised to replace the sandwich. Personally, after seeing that hair, I would rather get a refund because that was really nasty."}
{"text":"Service there is terrible.  Employees don't seem like they know what they are doing, they just walk away in the middle of them ringing you up and use absence language.   I purchase gift card for my staff and I went in there once or twice a week and even called for a month to get gift cards and they always said they were out of them and not sure when they will be getting them in.  Ended up going to another location where I received better service and was able to purchase gift cards.  I went in there today to purchase gift cards (called before I went down to make sure they had them) and when I got up there the cashier didn't know how to sell them so he asked someone else and was told that only a manager could do that (who was not in the store.)  The employee tried to contact manager but he/she did not answer and then the employee started to use absence language and manager is never available.  This is the only location that I even have problems with, even my employees say that they always get terrible service at this location and will never go there.  I will not be going into this location again."}
{"text":"Smoothies and food are fair priced and  very tasty. The owners are great people too. However their staff is another story. I went In today and the cashier walks up and just stares at me. No hello, how are you, nothing. So I tell her my smoothie and she doesn't tell me the price.. just looks at me so I ask. I hand her the money she takes it and just hands me the receipt. No thank you, it will be out soon, just stares at me and walks away. When my smoothie is ready she simply just puts on the counter and walks away. When you pay $7.00 for a smoothie. It would be nice to get a thank you at least. This is not my first interaction like this with the staff ."}
{"text":"The smoothies are great, the employees were very awkward. I felt as if I should be greeting them. And they kept me waiting while talking to other employees. That's a huge NO"}
{"text":"Tropical Smoothie Cafe has great smoothies...go with the Jetty Punch!  Had the food for the first time today and the buffalo chicken toasted wrap was excellent.  In my opinion, this is the best smoothie place around, including the two better known places.  Head in before 8:00 AM for a discount on smoothies."}
{"text":"Like it so far it's new something that else to add besides Starbucks lol to my visits"}
{"text":"this place is great!!!! even without the current \"group-on\" specials, even without the buy one - get one coupons printed on every receipt, even without the special which will run for 1 month from 5-7 pm ( i think!)
great smoothies - i love the one on priest near elliott.
my faves is the \"seasonal\" - green tea & basil and strawberry basil lemonade.  
***be aware-made with sugar unless you specify splenda or no sweeteners!***"}
{"text":"Terrible place and horrible management. They were out of mangos so we opted for another smoothie which they would not substitute nonfat yogurt without charging extra 0.75 in even though they had no mango to offer in the smoothie originally chosen. Manager insisted we needed to be charged, he had zero customer service skills and didnt appear to care much about anything. Their smoothies also often lack flavor and taste like watery ice. Don't waste your time or money on this location! (Go next door and get a great smoothie at One Stop Nutrition instead)"}
{"text":"I used to frequent this particular location, and finally had the first morning to grab breakfast in over 3 months so treated myself to here. My smoothie came out tasting like it was made with 90% dishwater and after waiting 20 minutes to be handed my wrap, it was ice cold. After a couple sips / bites of each I started to feel sick from the poor quality, and I had to throw the entire thing in the trash. What a waste. I will not be back."}
{"text":"I love tropical smoothie cafe! The experience that Katie has provided has just made it better everytime! Katie is uplifting, knowledgeable, and always vary positive! Thanks you Katie for the great experience you have giving me!"}
{"text":"We just stopped in earlier today to try to cool off from the heat. We missed the 'free smoothie' by a day (yesterday 6/15/12 was National Flipflop Day, apparently), but nonetheless we wanted to break away from our usual stop- Jamba Juice, and give this place a try. I've driven past it before as its near my old work as well as one of the best Philly cheesesteaks in the valley (Forefathers), but just never got around to stopping in.

The one thing I really liked is that, as opposed to Jamba Juice, they ACTUALLY have food! Not just pretzels! They have sandwiches, flatbread & wraps, amongst other items. However, we ate a couple hours earlier so we just came for the smoothies. 

We walked into your typical 'Hawaiian' ambiance, but at least it was clean and not OVERLY cheesy. The place was empty and we were instantly greeted as we walked in. The employee was very friendly and helpful. My wife got the Blue Lagoon and I got the Silky Peach (or something like that). Both were good, but I liked my wife's a little more. I didn't see if they had any 'free throw-ins' like they do at Jamba Juice, nor were we offered any, so I'm assuming they don't. They had some free samples of a peanut butter smoothie and flatbread sandwich on the counter, which we tried while we waited. Both were really good. 

I'll have to go back when I'm hungry to try the food, but the smoothies were definitely on-par to that of Jamba Juice."}
{"text":"Not one to write reviews but goodness something is wrong with this location. Sat in the drive through for 20 minutes twice."}
{"text":"Good location, good smoothies but rude and unreasonable slow service."}
{"text":"Customer service is so much better than legacy village. The staff is always helpful and polite. Erin is amazing"}
{"text":"Wouldn't honor their free smoothie promotion because THEIR system wasn't working properly. A sign was posted that if I texted a number I'd receive a free smoothie. I did NOT receive a free smoothie. I hope it's the cashier's first day because he didn't even seem like he knew where he was."}
{"text":"I love tropical smoothie, so when this one opened up I had to go. The staff is nice. Smoothie and sandwich was good. The only dowside was the music choice.  It was club music. Don't get me wrong I love hip hop, but it doesn't go with the typical Tropical Smoothie vibe. I felt like dancing after my meal. I don't feel like I'm at Tropical Smoothie. On the other hand the throwback music, reminded me of the songs that I hadn't  heard in a while.  The staff appreciated  the music, you could hear them singing along. At least they are happy.

In the end, I would come back again."}
{"text":"I want so badly to give this place 5 stars because the smoothies are amazing! (the food is just okay) But each and every time I go in the customer service is HORRIBLE. I've not once been greeted in and no one is ever at the register ready to take an order, you won't even get a \"I'll be with you in a minute\" there and the employees seem constantly confused with the register. Whenever I visit any tropical smoothies I can't help but to think how great this company could be if it had the right management. Needless to say even though I dread going in ill still stop by (whenever I have a few extra minutes-due to the usually long wait) for my peanut paradise."}
{"text":"Adore the product especially the fact that it's always a consistent flavor and texture!! The Blimey Limey is my favorite.

This location is generally faster and friendlier than the much busier shop on Charleston/Town Center."}
{"text":"The first couple times I went, I was very impressed!! Their location is on my way to work, so it was hard not to stop by and grab a smoothie. 
But the past several times me or my coworkers have gone, the service was horrible (holy attitude!) and their smoothies were just as bad. Mine was watered down to the point it tasted horrible. AND it wasn't even that cold. 
I don't know if it's because they hired new people or something, but definitely not impressed anymore. I still go their every now and then (when I don't have time to stop by Smoothie King and grab a smoothie) and it seems like things are maybe perking up a bit. I'm still skeptical, though."}
{"text":"I just left this location. I have been coming to this location for the last 2 years. Although I haven't been in a couple months my husband and I decided to get our usual smoothie and sandwich for dinner. They have new staff that doesn't seem to know what's on the menu. I asked for the turkey bacon ranch that comes on the ciabatta bread and the girl told me they don't use that bread. She asked the owner and the owner said yes they do. So then we always hey no sweetners and no sugar, once we drank our smoothies they tasted very sweet. I asked what they use to make it sweet and the owner said juice. So a few minutes later I decided to order another one because mine was to sweet. I asked the girl at the register to not use juice and only use water, she told me she cannot do that. 
Not sure why she can't make a change and just add water. Ridiculous!! I have always enjoyed the owner, she is a hard worker, but this new staff is clueless. 
We will have to go to another tropical smoothie."}
{"text":"We went to the drive thru around 1am on a Saturday night and there was one car in front of us. We could tell there was only one person working because it took forever for her to get our order in. When we got to the window we didnt even see the girl till after a few mins. She didnt repeat the order, but said the total amount and took our card. it took about ten mins to get two smoothies, a kids cheese quesadilla and chicken Cesar salad. The girl apologize for the wait but that's all she said. We were hoping the food was fresh since it took so long but that wasn't true. 
The quesadilla was alright, one of the smoothie was missing the sweetener, and the salad oh my gosh was nasty. It was old, and had a weird color on the leaves. If you're gonna be open for 24/7 restock your food with some fresh ones."}
{"text":"Wow this place is f$&king awful. To start the service sucks.. They move so slow, and they mixed up several people's orders.  People who ordered before us were getting their smoothies while we were still waiting for our salad and sandwich. My smoothie came up and tasted nothing like what it normally tastes like.  It was tasteless.  I've ordered this specific smoothie several times before with no issues at other locations. When my fiancé's salad was ready he opened the container had one bite and I could tell by his face something was wrong. He gave me some of the shredded carrots that were on his salad to try, I smelled them and realized they were bad. They smelled awful and he said they tasted sour. After all this time, at least 25 minutes to a half an hour for the food he didn't even want to ask for a new one. We just took off. We won't be returning to this location ever again."}
{"text":"If I could give a negative number I would.  I just left this store.  It was staffed with all young kids.  It was clear there was no supervision. In fact after 25 minutes and asking for my money back on of the worst culprits unlocked the register so clearly she was a manager.  She was on the phone constantly even while making smoothies.  When the kid at the register went in back to get his register opened to give me a refund there were about 7 people back there, they looked at him and when back to their conversation totally ignoring him.  Mind you no one was working making smoothies or sandwiches.  

Whoever owns this place better get their butt in that store and fire the vast majority of that staff."}
{"text":"This place is my new absolute favorite!! Every smoothie is sooooo good and so refreshing. I have absolutely no complaints except that I am obsessed and spend $5,51 almost every single day on this place :)"}
{"text":"First of all, I asked the cashier what was on the ultimate club because there weren't any descriptions on the board menu above the counter. He pushed a paper menu towards me, which didn't even have the ultimate club on it. When I pointed that out, he walked away looking somewhat frantic. So I just ordered the Caesar wrap. Got home and pulled it out of the bag and wondered why it was so hot. They put hot chicken in a salad wrap! Just what I wanted; wilted, hot lettuce. Not to mention there was barely any lettuce and the whole thing was drenched in dressing. Like I literally had to wipe off the dressing that was oozing out with a napkin. Terrible. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Food is ok, not great. Smoothies are good. What's most disappointing is the one person working in the restaurant. When I first arrived she was in the back restocking supplies. After taking our order, we waited 20 minutes for our food and smoothie with no one else here or in line. The poor gal behind the counter was the only person taking orders and making the food. A few minutes later the place had a line. Can't imagine how long they'll have to wait to be served. Hire some more staff -- you all need it bad."}
{"text":"Chipotle style place.. The only thing is that they open for 24/7 and that the food tastes worse..(if possible)
The experience is that it's a junk food place that trying to sell you health in a form of healthy smoothie... While serving you junk food and smoothies that are far from being healthy..
Hey, they can do whatever they like but you should know that the food is horrible.. Just a nice name for an alternative junk food.."}
{"text":"This is the worst location that I've been to in LV/Henderson. I just left with a smoothie that was full of chunks of ice. I used the restrooms when I was there and they were dirty. Graffiti etched into the mirror and no one could handle putting the huge toilet paper in the dispenser so it was just sitting on top. Crappy experience, won't be back to this location any time soon."}
{"text":"First timer! I had to try 2!
I ordered the Totally Green Smoothie which is so refreshing and has just enough sweetness (green apple & kiwi). It's my first time having anything with Kale & I think it's delicious! Definitely something I will try at home & have again when I'm in the area. 
My second drink I wanted a yogurt blend & chose the Get Up and Goji. It's like a nice refreshment at the beach. Light & tangy & sweet with the lil fullness of yogurt. 
Only reasons I didn't give 5 stars were:
They only offer 1 size & it's $5 a drink. 
The place is small & loud. 
Customer service was ok but not great."}
{"text":".......I actually visit this location quite often because they have a drive thru. That being said do let me comment that the employees there can vary in service from average to completely rude.
....... I do recommend that you try your drinks before leaving to check for errors.  I have been fortunate to have the correct mixture combination for each of order except for once which I had them remake
....... Tropical smoothie cafe offers a text service where they will text you coupon and the coupons, about once a week at least sometimes more for some pretty good deals. Sometimes the free food with the purchase sometimes half off on your drink sometimes buy one and get one free.
....... Too many smoothies?... Live alone only based one drink.  I have good tip for you.   You need a freezer and a blender. I have found I put my second smoothie in the freezer I've left it there from  days up to a weeks. When I am ready for it I take it out let it semi-thaw.  Once its soft on outer perimeter but a little more stiffer on the center core I put it in the blender run the blender and BAM JUST LIKE NEW!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service... I'm not sure if they only have one employee or what. But every single time I come in here w/o a doubt, it takes the woman 15 minutes just to take my order when there is absolutely no line. Either get more attentive staff or hire more employees."}
{"text":"I had a hard time finding this place. Didn't know it was inside of Green Valley Ranch casino. But that's not a deal breaker. The staff is nice and very friendly.  I don't mind the walk through the casino to get there.  The parking in the garage is not overly crowded, well at least the times that I  was there. This is by far my favorite Tropical Smoothie compared to the rest. 

Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Terrible and disgusting experience.

I do not expect nice customer service or great food at fast food restaurants like this location, but it was the worst customer service I have experienced, the food I got looked like a trash or left over food, and the table tops and the floor of the front and the back was dirty. Especially the kitchen floor seemed to have water leaks or an overflow somewhere. Simply the entire place was not really being cared or maintained.
Anyway I always order a same kind of smoothie and chicken wrap every time I go to any TSC location. At this location, I ordered the same things for to go as usual and everything was just fine until I saw the girl who was a cashier went into the kitchen and started making my wrap with unwashed bare hands after touched insanitary things like money. I wanted to ask them to make a new one, but I decided not to because I didn't want to be a \"picky\" customer. She brought me the food and I got into my car and opened the paper wrap to eat the food, but I couldn't even touch it once I saw how messy the food was! Tortilla of my chicken wrap started being unfold as I opened the paper wrap meaning the tortilla was wrapping the ingredients roughly so I could see the ingredients were dumped carelessly and the sauce was overflowing out of tortilla. The worse was that the ingredients looked obviously not fresh at all. I went back to the restaurant and asked the other girl there to refund the money showing how disgusting the wrap was. She went to the kitchen and brought the girl who made the wrap. I asked her again the same, but she said she couldn't because there was no manager acting like the wrap had nothing wrong. Then I just left leaving the wrap next to their POS. It was not worth wasting my time arguing with them."}
{"text":"I ordered online twice at this store and they never have my order ready. Very unorganized and not friendly service. The store at the S Las Vegas Blvd (Outlets) is way better."}
{"text":"I'm truly not much of a complainer, but I honestly can't say I've ever had worse service than this in my life. 

The main reason we went here was for a quick and easy meal as we had somewhere to be in 30 minutes. We walked in around 1pm on a Saturday and there were a few people in the drive-thru, but for the most part they were empty. We order two wraps and a smoothie, sit down and wait. Ten minutes later our smoothie comes out, we're starting to get a little antzy, but no big deal. Another ten minutes roll by and nothing, at this point we've finished the smoothie and the staff become snarky when we ask for a time estimate. Not only were we ignored for 3-5 minutes while they were flirting in the back, but one girl literally walked by on her cell phone and looked right at us as if she could careless.

In the end, we received our food 40 minutes after ordering only to find it cold. If we wanted to spend that much time, we could've gone to a nicer restaurant. I've always liked Tropical Smoothie, but I can guarantee I will NEVER go back to this location again. Buyer beware, these children are unsupervised and obviously the owner could careless."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!!!!! Sitting at the drive threw at the window for 30 minutes!!!! WHAT THE HELL!"}
{"text":"Horrible food. Horrible customer service. Ordered a wrap with NO CHEESE for my daughter. She has a dairy allergy which  I clearly stated when ordering.
Had my daughter check the wrap while we were still in the restaurant even though we were carrying out.
HAD CHEESE in it so I told the girl at the register who took my order. She yelled back to the girl making the wrap  \" I said it has NO CHEESE\". So we waited again while the same girl remade the wrap.
She gave it to me and apologized. I told her no worries..and left. BIG MISTAKE. 
Got home, still had pieces throughout...and the tortilla had the same MELTED CHEESE from before.
SHE REUSED THE TORTILLA AND JUST PICKED OUT THE BIG PIECES OF CHEESE. 
We threw it away. I just wasted $8. 
IM JUST GLAD MY KID DID NOT EAT IT AND HAVE A SEVERE ALLERGIC REACTION.
Plenty of other restaurants who care about the quality of food, staff and customer service. Won't be back."}
{"text":"So nice. Cut my Jamaican Jerk in 1/2. Wrapped it separately and gave me 2 kids cups so I could take my kids separate lunches."}
{"text":"This is the worst one. More than once my wrap has had little to no substance and the kids that work here are rude. I drive to one farther away from my house because I hate this one. The owner needs to do something"}
{"text":"This would be the first review I have ever written and I had to do so because of the kids who work at this place. So I get a strawberry beach, taste it and it literally tastes like ice...I then simply ask the gentleman can you remake this. It doesn't taste like anything. He says ok, goes in back and then tries to call out the person who didn't make it properly. He finds the person and then she cops an attitude on why she's gotta make it over again. A couple more words here and there, then  it starts to get remade. Now I'm standing by the window looking in back and can hear everything they were saying. These are the situations were I wanna say something but don't want to cause problems because all in all its a fuckin smoothie. I just feel irritated because someone cannot own up to making a mistake and keep their mouths shut. I've been in the service industry for 16+ years and have been there. So I know what a annoying customer is. And I am not one, I respect the process. Please teach these kids how to interact with customers. Might help them later in life."}
{"text":"what can i say about this place, it is the best in my opinion. none of those garbage smoothie places come close. No jamba or smoothie king or even fast food or fro-yo places can compare. I love this location inside the green valley ranch because it is right next to my school. the prices here are a little steep compared to the ones all over town. acai berry boost with whey, never order anything but it, and never will... this smoothie alone has changed my life, believe it or not..."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a negative star,  I would. I've lived around the corner from this place for 7 years and this is only my fourth time going, reason being: HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE EVERY TIME! I decided to give them another chance today because I took my mom to the gym with me,  which is in the same parking lot.  We walked in and there were two girls working,  neither even acknowledged that we were there. We stood there for a while,  and then the girl that was helping the people in the drive thru turned around and said, \"What can I get you?\".... still no hello. So, we started to order,  but she stayed by the drive thru and didn't even look at us,  so now we're raising our voices to ask her the questions that we had.  She made no eye contact,  and ignored our question.  So,  we stood there,  in shock for another couple of minutes until finally telling her that their customer service was horrible and that we'd be contacting their manager.  Everytime I've gone,  it was a different person, but the same horrible service...stay away!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this isn't a positive review: My family and I moved to Tega Cay 2.5 years ago...we stumbled upon this YUMMY cafe' straight away and have been EXTREMELY regular customers ever since (3x weekly @ minimum). The food is okay...but we really ADORE the smoothies. We also appreciated that this is a small family owned franchise. Every single time we have family & friends come for a visit we ALWAYS teat them to this cafe' (our favorite and only smoothie place)!! That changed today...today my husband arrived home from a long trip away and since we had time to spare before a meeting....he said he would swing by the house & pick me up...so I phoned in my smoothie order (just mine this time) so it would be ready when we arrived (we live a mere  0.7 miles away). Calling in my order is something I've done periodically over the past couple of years. So...my husband pulls into a parking space...he remains in the vehicle and hands me $20 and jokingly says...Hey...am I going to see any change from that?? I laughed and said...sure...How about I buy us dinner later!! I went inside and the OWNER grabbed my smoothie from the refrigerator and proceeded to ring me up...when he handed me my change....it was short...so I mention it....1st time ever btw...and he said...no, you gave me a $10 bill....and I responded, Um, no, I didn't, I am 100% positive I handed you a $20. He was insistent that it was a $10...So I said...truly...if I didn't know for certain I would tell you 'gosh I really don't know if it was a 10 or 20 and I would let it be'...However, I am 100% sure that I handed you a $20 and then I proceeded to relay the funny exchange between my husband and I just 60 seconds earlier...And  (jokingly) said, 'Hey, if you don't believe me, ask my husband...And oh my goodness...he did!!! I was STUNNED. Not just stunned, I was hurt!! There were several people in the cafe' and I was visibly shaken. This man see's my face (and that of my family) three times or more every week for YEARS...and he's not willing to take my word that I am certain I handed him a $20 bill? From my view this was absolutely horrible customer service and I am deeply saddened by his response to this situation. Anyway...When my husband concurred it was indeed a $20 bill....the owner did give me back the rightful amount due...but at this point the damage was already done!!!!"}
{"text":"Their customer service is absolutely terrible. Stood at the counter for 15 mins, not one acknowledgement. Every time we go to this location, the service is terrible and the food is mediocre. It sucks because this is the location closest to our home. They should seriously shut this place down or find new management."}
{"text":"Love the smoothies!!.....but hate the wait in the drive thru and once your stuck in the drive thru there is NO way out to change your mind, its a trap! Service is extremely slow, so they must always be under staffed and over worked or have a turnover of staff because of the management. I have had to go someplace else because they are too slow. Used to have the \"buy 5 get 1 free card\" but they discontinued that, and they used to have the TS Cup for a discount if you had their cup but again they discontinued that as well. I never see the same employees there, must have a high turn over or poor management. Sad because the smoothies are good IF you can afford to wait 30 minutes to get one!!"}
{"text":"I love this place now. After going back a couple more times the staff is much quicker to turn orders. 

Also, everyone is really nice; not pushy, and I got some good coupons. 

I also looked up the caloric value of these and the sugar content wasn't bad, 280 calories in a massive (one size) Island Green smoothie. 

I'll take this over Jamba Juice any day!"}
{"text":"This was a ridiculous long wait in the drive thru . We waited 17 minuted before even  recieving geeting . By the time we got the smoothie it was warm and melted and the sandwich was cold, not to mention not very accommodating.  Very disappointing"}
{"text":"Tried their smoothies several times and several different flavors and I am not a fan.  I can make a better smoothie with my VitaMix!  I prefer Jamba Juice.  
I do love their spinach wrap (Popeye's Favorite).  Have had it many times and it never disappoints."}
{"text":"AWFUL SERVICE!  I walked up to the counter to order, followed by another customer.  There were THREE employees milling around and working, making other people's orders.  We stood at the register for 5 mins and we were IGNORED.  Not one of the employees even had the courtesy to acknowledge us, to tell us they'd be with us in a minute, they just ignored us. 

I'm a very patient person.  And I understand if someone is busy, I don't mind waiting.  BUT there were only 3 other customers in the whole store!"}
{"text":"After frequently going to the Surprise location me and my sister were very excited to try this location.  The service was subpar and unfriendly, after waiting a bit for our smoothies they didn't taste anything like the one's we grew to love at the Surprise location. These tasted just like bananas and ice. After complaining and getting a remake it was a bit better, but still not as good. Turns out the sugar scooper is broken and the employee was just guessing how much sugar to put in.... pretty upset for a $6 not so great smoothie. I will just have to drive out to the surprise location."}
{"text":"Went to tropical smoothie yesterday and loved it. Had a wrap and a strawberry banana smoothie. Didn't even know that they served food. The wrap was on point! Smoothie was very comparable to Jamba...which is a good thing. Service was fast and Sarah at the cashier was a lot of help. She even gave me an extra cup for the extra from the smoothie. Going back for sure. 

-Joe"}
{"text":"This place is great! Staff is super nice! Place is clean! Smoothies are not only awesome tasting but are healthy too!
Don't forget they have food! I realized you can swap fake chicken in for the real thing and it tasted awesome! I will def be back!!"}
{"text":"Upon pulling up to the establishment it appeared as if it was closed, I was a Tuesday evening in the 9 o'clock hour, according to postings online they don't close until 2 a.m. I did see one person in there and after noticing the only thing turned on was the open sign I walked in.  The two guys working seemed either annoyed or surprised to see another customer not really sure. Smoothie was okay seem like it was missing a little ice cream as it was almost room temperature tasting I'm like a normal smoothie there. As I was grabbing my straw and preparing to depart one of their friends came in using foul language asking one of them why they were still there. Seemed as if they wanted to keep the establishment looking closed as they weren't very attentive in general during our interaction. If I was the business owner of this establishment I would be highly upset knowing my employees were running my business like this I normally don't complain in this level of detail for that matter but knowing these establishments are franchises best the owner know what's going on. My biggest issue was all the interior lights in the front of the restaurant were turned off I almost pulled away which would have forced me to drive to a much further location luckily the only thing that saved it was the sign.
Honestly probably won't return might try another location"}
{"text":"Great smoothies, cheaper then jamba juice, friendly staff.  I go here often and have never had a bad experience here.  Would recommend to anyone, they have plastic cups too and you get a discount if you bring it."}
{"text":"Stopped in when they were busy, ordered and waited for more than 20 minutes for 1 smoothie before giving up.

Ended up asking for our money back - their excuse - \"We're not making them in any particular order\"."}
{"text":"First, I was unable to try any smoothies because they re-use the same mixers for dairy and non-dairy smoothies. So, if you have an allergy to dairy, avoid eating here. Second, we had to send back food we ordered with no cheese and get it again. Mistakes happen, but they just were not listening and did not put much effort into the service. Third, the food was overpriced and just mediocre. There are better, healthier options almost anywhere else in the city."}
{"text":"I came here 30 mins before close and I sat in the drive thru for a good 5 mins before they even greeted me and asked for my order. Horrible customer service. I understand if you're busy then okay just let me know you'll be right with me.. Second I tried to order a chicken pesto flatbread only for the employee to tell me their ovens are over heating so they can't make food? How does an oven overheat if it's meant to get hot? This is why I never go to this location."}
{"text":"I love this tropical smoothie, customer service is always great and food is amazing!  Seems like this is the only one that has macroni salad. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Horrible staff and service.  Over 25 minutes and still no smoothie.  Staff was talking about how gross and smelly the food was.  One stated \"I am afraid to serve this food because it stinks so bad\".  Had to get a refund and seemed to be bothering the employee that was trying to leave and socialize with friends. 

Stay away"}
{"text":"Not the tropical smoothie I expected in Aliante.   The customer service is terrible. I've been waiting in the drive through for 20 minutes (mind you I was the only car in line).  There was only one family inside, not to my surprise, they got irritated and left empty handed.  The staff is a bunch of young kids that play around behind the counter.  By far the worst tropical smoothie I been to in my life.  P.S. I am actually writing this review while I'm waiting in the drive through."}
{"text":"I have been to this new location a few times and absolutely love the food and smoothies, but at my last visit this girl with red hair had absolutely terrible customer service. She came to the window and said \"here's your food\" as she tossed it at us. I will not be returning to this location because of this experience."}
{"text":"This tropical sucks! They have no good customer service skills, they have a place ran by teenagers, their place is ALWAYS dirty when I come, and when I come in only one person is working. The experience I always get is they see me at the counter and I end up standing there for 5-10 mins till they come to take my order. Great customer service is saying \"I'll be with you in a minute\". But not saying anything at all is just plain rude! I am never coming to this tropical smoothie again.  & to top it off they never get my smoothie right! It always taste bitter. I'm sticking to Jamba Juice. You guys just lost a customer. You guys don't even deserve a star."}
{"text":"Don't know why this place gets a bad rap. I have been here several times and they have always been nice and helpful. Smoothies are great and I have even had some food here from time to time. Hit it up and you won't be disappointed. They also have a great military discount."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Tropical Smoothie Cafe, but this is my first time at this location and the first time my daughters quesadilla looked like THIS. The tortilla wasn't toasted whatsoever and inside (as well as outside, it was a mess) was a blob of pizza sauce and a few sprinkles of cheese. Not worth the $4+, very disappointing. I gave two stars for the smoothie which was great!"}
{"text":"One of the workers came in and made her son & husband a drink first before customers then they didn't know which drink was in which blender. This place keeps going downhill. They are no longer friendly."}
{"text":"I used to really like this place for a quick smoothie after the gym but this time was crap. I'm pretty sure the cashier was high. She couldn't take our order without giggling. I repeated my order, just a damn sandwich three time times and she looked at my boyfriend, laughed, and giggled that she didn't know what I was saying. Then the service was slow as hell and we were the only ones there. Usually I wouldn't write a bad review but seriously, you're only as good as the employees you hire and this chick was a waste."}
{"text":"Great quality of food, smoothie and service.   I feel this location provides the excellent reputation that I have learned to know from Tropical Smoothie.   I highly recommend."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for lunch today we ordered two raps which took 39 minutes to receive we both took one bite set the food down and left. This place is dirty the floor is filthy and the employees seemed to care more about their phone call then us. Someone should tell the owner that's there is a thing called a mop."}
{"text":"The only reason that I gave two stars is the staff tries their hardest to deal with the severely understaffed condition.

An average wait time of 20 minutes for customers (observed from personal experience) is unacceptable.

I suspect that the owner of this location may not give a darn about the situation; he or she would otherwise staff the place properly.  The understaffing condition is obvious to any customer who enters the location.  Pinching pennies, at the price of shortchanging customer service and unnecessarily overburdening your employees, is not a good business modus operandi.

Get a grip, owner.  And until you do, I and my friends and family will boycott your place."}
{"text":"So far I have been to the new location twice and both times were good. Wasn't waiting 15 to 20 minutes like how it used to be the smoothies were just as good at least two times I've tried it so far. It is still a bunch of teens working there but they are fairly polite"}
{"text":"Everytime I've gone to this location, the smoothies were absolutely HORRIBLE. They were always too sweet. I tried to like the smoothies, i gave it so many chances, but each time I was disappointed. I think it's just the location because I've tried a Tropical Smoothie on Las Vegas Blvd and another in Summerlin and they were excellent. It's just very inconvenient to go to those locations because this one is the closest to where I stay.

The only good thing here I would say is the food. I've gotten a couple of wraps and some salads here and they were pretty good."}
{"text":"Is there a way to choose 0 stars?? 

I am a huge huge lover of tropical smoothie. I typically get a smoothie almost every day. But I've never been to a tropical smoothie where the drive thru takes TOO MUCH TIME. I actually turn my car off during each wait time.. yes, it takes that long. 

I work in a fine dining restaurant on the strip and our food comes out faster than this drive thru. 

Not to mention the employees could care less about their jobs. I find huge chunks in my smoothie every time. 
I will say, today there was a very sweet and vibrant gentleman at the window. He even complimented my sunnies. I liked him. Good employee... still chunks in my smoothie. 

I gave this particular tropical smoothie many many chances. And as I sit in the drive thru as I write this I say with 100% seriousness that this will be my last visit here. Bummer since it's less than 1 mile from my house. Looks like I will drive farther to never have to deal with this again. Very very frustrated."}
{"text":"I used to be a huge fan of tropical smoothie. The service at many of them has been awful. May just go back to exclusively making my own smoothies from now on."}
{"text":"My first visit to a Tropical Smoothie Cafe. I ordered a Kiwi smoothie and it took 15 minutes to make it. I'm glad it wasn't busy. The smoothie was good. After I placed my order I saw a Peanut Butter / Chocolate and Banana smoothie. If I go back, I hope to try it."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, the service not so much. As I am writing this review there are 4 people in line, no one behind the register, and 2 people making the orders, except there are no orders for them to be making bc everyone has already been served, except the 4 people waiting in line, that have been standing there for at least 5 minutes. The 2 people behind the prep counter are not even acknowledging the people waiting to let them know they will be just a minute (or 10)... We didn't get our chips and then had to wait in that line just to get them, when we tried to stop the girl serving people to ask for them she just looked at us and ignored us...we also asked for our mall employee discount and never received it. What they could have done was make sure they have someone at least acknowledging the existence of customers because otherwise we have no idea if we are going to be helped or not...lunch breaks are only an hour and I sure don't feel like spending it waiting to order my food, and then waiting again to get what I initially ordered..."}
{"text":"This place is a JOKE!  They are constantly out of everything.  On various visits, they have been out of straws, cups and soy.  Once, their toaster was broken, so they could not make any sandwiches that were toasted, so when I tried to order something else, they informed me that they were out of one of the sauces that is used on several of the sandwiches, so they couldn't make any of those, either.  Yesterday, I tried to order a Kiwi Quencher and they were out of kiwi.  Amazing!  Plus, the place is run by 16-year olds.  The looks on their faces are priceless when you go up to the counter and order something that they don't have; they become annoyed when you can't INSTANTLY pick something else.  If you go here, have at least 3 options in mind, because trust me: they're out of your top 2 choices."}
{"text":"If you sign up for the txt message alerts from tropical smoothie and take them here, this place always has some sort of condition on every single one and very poor customer service."}
{"text":"I've come here a dozen times and I just come here for the smoothies.   I like that they have a lot of options for smoothies and food options.  

When I call for my order, it's always a hit or miss, or miss some more.  Being on a lunch break, I need the precious minutes.  Sometimes when I call, even after 5 minutes apart, no one answers.  When I go in to order, it's not even busy.  I take an early lunch at 1100am so it's not busy at all...  So that was irritating.  The employees are rude and not welcoming.  Something needs a change.

Other than that, smoothies are great."}
{"text":"I have ordered a wrap and smoothie from this cafe previously. The wrap was small and the smoothie was very bland (mainly because they did not have all of the ingredients) but I figured I'd try them again today. The smoothie I ordered was decent but had a chalkie taste. The salad was pitiful especially because I paid over $7 for it. It also did not have any spinach just Romaine nor did it have cilantro. Worse salad ever!?"}
{"text":"Never again. I will drive 20 miles and wait less time than we did. We ordered 3 smoothies and waited 30 minutes! A one person staff??? Really?  Nice girl, but whoever manages this place needs to hire more people. Save yourself time and go to another tropical smoothie."}
{"text":"\"I was so disappointed with this place, that I was compelled to write this almost as soon as I finished eating.\" says Kellie A. in a review over a year ago.  Well lets start by saying that not a whole lot has changed in a year and that was my first thought on my drive back to work.

First off I already had read some of the reviews and it was a consistent \"customer service is crap\" here.  I didn't pick the place as I was meeting my friend for a lunch date.

When I walk in my friend is at the front of the line and there is a lady behind her.  No staff around.  We wait.  And wait.  And finally Mr. Ignacio shows up.  No greeting just asked my friend what she wanted to order.  When he finally got to me I ordered a Chicken Caesar salad and a diet coke.  He then asks me if I want a 12 oz or a 24 oz and without hesitation I order the 12 oz thinking the smaller is better....not fully realizing its a kids cup.  I pay for my meal (by the way he never told me how much it was) and he walks away.  No receipt.  No drink cup.  No \"I will have your order right out\".  So I move to the side to see if someone can help me.  Immediately he is annoyed and \"thought\" he gave me a cup (my kids cup).  I ask if THAT is 12 oz and he said yes.  Ok I guess?  Would have been nice to mention that little detail. The receipt without any conversation was awkward not knowing if he was going to give it to me or not.  Again he hands it to me and walks away in silence.  What a ball of joy this guy is.

So my name is called and I kindly thank the guy (another employee) for my lunch.  My girlfriend ordered the same salad and as I am a quarter through I look at her salad and realize mine doesn't have chicken.  I quickly look at my receipt and make sure I ordered it with chicken. Sure enough they forgot the chicken.  So once more I'm headed to the front with no one around waiting for assistance.  Mr. Ignacio's slow ass comes up and as nice as can be I state that my Chicken Caesar Salad is missing chicken-praying and hoping they don't spit on it.  No apologies just an argument of him wanting my salad back and me not wanting them to do bad things to it.  I informed him that he can bring out the chicken separately which he did and added extra to be nice I guess. Thanks but no thanks.  The chicken looked gross and was clearly nuked (a little cold in the middle).  Maybe that's why they drench the salad in dressing \"over\" the whole salad so you don't see the chicken-which is how my friend's looked when it came out.  

Anyways, I counted like 4 employees in the back.  Don't know what the heck they were doing because no one was up front unless forced to when a line piled up.  Not to mention not one of them paying attention to customers up front. This is exactly what I'm talking about how special it is to have a young person giving great customer service.  Because it is not often that you see that.  In this case with Ignacio, I cant believe they have him servicing people.  No personality and not one skill of customer service.  Very sad.  Lets just hope someone mentors the poor guy to grow up with a positive and friendly attitude. 

Like other reviews there isn't much to say positive. What a disappointment on all levels.  Maybe management should check out the reviews to realize after a year they aren't getting better...sigh.  Definitely will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"We had the most excellent customer service from  Sabrina today! Not only did she have excellent suggestions to make our smoothies delicious, she was extra sweet to my four year old. All around an excellent employee with outstanding customer service!"}
{"text":"Don't even waste your time... I spent 26 minutes stuck behind 3 cars and was so frustrated I left without my order. I'll never return."}
{"text":"OMG! Skip this place. Showed up here on a Sunday and they had only one employee, maybe 16 or 17 years old. People waiting in line 6 deep and she was so rude, we walked out. Have been here before and the food was OK, smoothie better. They don't wear gloves here and the store was a complete mess.

I asked for the owner/manager's name. She gave it to me and so I called Robert Bradley to let him know about the complete lack of customer service. After speaking with Robert, it became quite clear the reason that the service is so awful. At least they are consistent... Never again will I find myself in a Tropical Smoothie Cafe."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for a smoothie and when I went over to see what was happening (because there were multiple people who were behind me in line and they'd all gotten their food and smoothies already) the girl working was incredibly rude and gardly apologized or said if anyrhing was wrong. Her reaponse was \"oh, we're just really busy\" and walked away. Everyone else got their food and smoothies walked over to them and mine was slammed on the counter. Needless to say, I will not be back and will dissuade anyone else I know from going."}
{"text":"Slowest drive thru I've ever been stuck in. Ridiculous how smoothies and flat bread can take so long. They must have the orchards on the roof and pick the fruit fresh for each order. What else would explain taking over 5min per each car."}
{"text":"This location is hit or miss. Every three times I go there, the smoothies are really good and the workers are friendly. We just went there, my goji smoothie doesn't taste like there's any goji in it. My husbands smoothie tastes bland. They were dead and it took 12 minutes to get 2 smoothies, not to mention it took her awhile to answer the drive through. We thought with the wait time she was working alone. Then we saw a second male worker. She handed us out smoothies and said,\"here you go\" and shut the window. I felt like we were bothering her for ordering."}
{"text":"The absolute worst! Waited over 25 minutes I'm the drive thru for a smoothie. Only two cars in front of me, complete understaffed and disorganized. Won't be coming back.

AND, my smoothie, if you can call it that, which is nothing more than ice and barely any flavor, SUCKS."}
{"text":"Avoid patronizing the Tropical Smoothie in Anthem unless you want your order wrong, a revolving door of employees who come and go, and perhaps worst yet, the feeling that you as a customer don't really matter. 

There are dozens of other smoothie businesses that are more deserving of loyal customer who I can't image will do worse. 

Consider going to Jamba Juice, Proteins & Greens, Lyfe Cafe, and Pressed For Juice, which are all a very short drive from Anthem.

Sometimes it is worth driving a few extra miles to go to a business that knows how to GET IT RIGHT!"}
{"text":"They are soooo slow, it took them forever to take my order, he acted like he couldn't hear me then I'm still having to wait to get the drink. If I could have got out of the line in the drive thru I would have. This is ridiculous"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a smoothie and a sandwich. They weren't busy at all the place was mess, tables were dirty as well as the floor. The restrooms were disgusting there was no soap in at the hand washing sink so I must ask how are the employees washing their hands after using the restroom. Overall I will not visit this location again."}
{"text":"terrible service. terrible workers. don't go here at all."}
{"text":"Food was okay. It and the smoothies are much better at the Craig road location. I want to like this place as it is more convenient for me but the service is terrible nobody greeted me at the drive through.. How long has this place been open!? Good luck management you have some work to do to turn this location around. It'll  be closed soon if nothing is done fast.."}
{"text":"GO here! After you try it, you'll become a regular. Recommend the Island Green, Mango Magic, and Kiwi Quencher!!"}
{"text":"I have only been to this location a couple of times but have been very happy with the service and my orders. They currently have a deal where all of their smoothies are 50% off before 10am. Amazing deal, making them $2.25-$2.50 each, especially since their smoothies are 24 oz.! 

I intentionally went into the bathroom to check it out since another review mentioned how disgusting it was. It was spotless, although it was first thing in the morning when I was there so maybe that was the difference?

As for the reviewer who commented that they have \"pre-processed\" smoothies made with powders and juices, I'm not sure if she's ever made smoothies. When I make them at home, I put in juices along with various fruits. As for the powders they have, those are for the extra boosts that customers can buy for energy, etc. 

So, with all that being said, this is a great little restaurant. And their prices seem very reasonable for fresh ingredients. I am looking forward to trying their noodle entrées next. They look yummy!"}
{"text":"Unorganized. Dirty kitchen. I waited 10 minutes just to get acknowledged. Won't be coming back even though the smoothie wasn't half bad."}
{"text":"This is the slowest tropical smoothie I have ever been too. They have to be short staffed or something I waited over ten min to order them over 15 to get my food (which came out before my smoothie). Now I'm late to class and even more annoyed than before."}
{"text":"My daughter loves coming here so I usually bring her up here once or twice a week if her grades are being kept up. However, the staff is usually unprofessional and not very well trained. It's in a nice location and the interior is well kept, however they need to do a better job of training their employees. The smoothies are okay, but if they could just improve employee training that would be a big plus for them."}
{"text":"Love tropical smoothie, but my experience tonight was less than subpar. Poor guy was working alone with a line of people out the door, so I can't blame him for the service. My health nut smoothie has way too much whey protein that it's the consistency of sand. And as for my \"PEANUT BUTTER\" crunch wrap.... Well there's a serious lack of peanut butter. Not to mention he also didn't chop up the bananas. (See photo) 
 

Just to be clear, the bad review isn't for employee himself but rather the management of this store. Seems like you're working your employees like slaves and that's why the reviews here are so horrible."}
{"text":"Usually I come late generally after ten or so, just because of my work schedule and school and whatever else I have going on. 
My favorite order is the chipotle chicken flatbread and an acai berry boost with no sweetener. For some reason this t smooth makes it the best. I have gotten this order from other places and the gentlemen who work these hours for some reason make it better than any other time I go or anything. 
At one point the cashier knew my order and repeated it to me without me having to say a thing. I'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing and proves how much I go here, it's better than me constantly ordering Robertos which is right next door. 

I never used to be a fan of this place because being from California we don't have a tropical smoothie and I was so accustomed to Jamba and Robeks but I have grown to really like the sandwiches and the smoothies also. My sister who came to visit me once even wishes we had a location out in California because I made her eat this while she was out here! She tells me all the time to bring some back for her."}
{"text":"Average smoothie I think they are upping there option because I noticed a section of healthy protein stile shakes like I see at the gym but still not too sure what's in it because even it has the fruits and protein powder they claim Font know what extra sugars and stuff they add in. Overall though it's a cool place to chill and if your in the mood for something cold it hits the spot"}
{"text":"This was s great little spot. I really wanted a \"good\" smoothie and my husband and I found this one on yelp. The smoothie and food was so good we stopped by the next day and got another. We also shared their Cajun or curry sandwich and it was truly yummy with a little kick. It was full of just the right amount of everything. 
I must note that on the first day my smoothie had a lot more banana flavor and on the second day it was perfect and no flavor out weighed the other. So, it must be who makes it - you may have to consider asking for a balance if you get one of the banana ones. I Love banana- my husband does not. Nope they do not All have banana in them - plenty of flavors and add ins to choose from."}
{"text":"If you want a smoothie this is a great place. They have a variety of flavors to chose from. Although if you come here for food and a smoothie, you might be a little disappointed.  Their food is small portions and for a larger price tag. 

We bought a groupon so we thought we'd give their good a try. I think we will just stick with smoothies next time though."}
{"text":"My favorite smoothie is the Tropicolada which is no longer on the menu but they made it for me anyway.  I got the California flatbread sandwich which is chicken, bacon, avocado, lettuce, and basil garlic mayo.  It was really delicious.  And I love that this location has potato salad or macaroni salad as a side option.  The food totally hit the spot and I will be back again.  I avoid this place during rush times though as it does take quite a while to get your food.  But on the off times, it's grand!"}
{"text":"Good food and smoothies. There is a little bit of a wait, but they are always consistent so it isn't a surprise. It is worth waiting for and priced fair IMO."}
{"text":"Customer service was awful... the cashier was either super exhausted or just really bad at her job. The food was okay... the smoothies weren't as good as normal. Maybe just an off day... wasn't impressed"}
{"text":"Always a wait- staff inattentive- music blasting and a hassle every time- more interested in socializing - as if they don't see a line - last time coming here"}
{"text":"Our first experience was awful! We waited an entire half an hour to get 3 basic smoothies with our 2 year son! No food was with our order! Some people came in after us and received their order before us. The girls that worked that day were very rude and seemed like they had no experience in customer service! I understand people have a bad day and sometimes we take it out on the wrong people. We are all human! No one apologized when my husband finally asked about why our order was taking 20 minutes. Smoothies came out and we left but my husband decided to call and complain. This is where the 4 stars come in because the manager called us the next day after reviewing the tape footage from the store. She gave us a refund for our previous order and gave us another order with a food item of our choice! Smoothies are great and because of the response from the manager we will be returning!"}
{"text":"Worst tropical smoothie location! Smoothie tasted like water for almost $7. Employees weren't friendly and menu boards are falling from ceiling. They have a bunch of flyers on the counter from two weeks ago, so no one has wiped down the counter or even noticed?.. what else does that mean they are missing?! Also had an odor of slight sewage which definitely doesn't make you feel \"tropical\" and \"fresh\" when you enter lol. I was the only person in there and still the employee loudly yelled out my order twice before I could even sit up, how hard is it to lean over and let me know? Never returning!"}
{"text":"Place smelled disgusting, counters were covered in sticky stuff, trash on the floors. Basically confirms all the other reviews that say this place is disgusting"}
{"text":"This place is unbelievably slow! If you take a 4 hour lunch this is the place to go! However, I take a 30 minute lunch and spent all 30 minutes sitting in the drive thru and on top of this somehow they screwed up my order! I ordered a wrap that was falling apart and sauce everywhere and I specifically asked for no onions and it was FULL of onions!!!! This place is unprofessional, slow and all my co-workers have had to go through this on a consistent basis! Very unsatisfied....one star is seriously too much for them!"}
{"text":"This place needs to get it together. Love tropical smoothie but I will not be returning to this location. The last three times I have been, they've bad ONE employee working. One person in charge of managing the register and making smoothies is a recipe for disaster. Mind you, this has been in the morning during peak smoothie business hours. Every time I've been I have waited a solid 20 minutes in line to even put my order in, then another 20 min to receive my order. 40 min of waiting for a smoothie?? I'll make one at home. HIRE MORE EMPLOYEES YOU GUYS!!!"}
{"text":"Love going to this place. The staff is great and my favorite drink, Peanut Paradise, is always on point!"}
{"text":"This Tropical Smoothie is the best in town!  Always clean, food is great, service is good.  I believe it's because the owners are there working about 98% of the time.  They are very hard working people, and always remember my name when I come in.  We drive out of our way to get our smoothies and wraps here, they are always the best!"}
{"text":"Love this location! Besides the tried and true smoothies, the staff is friendly, they have a drive thru, and they are open 24 hours. I took away one star because sometimes the drive thru is slow, but even then the employees always acknowledge it and apologize. I go out of my way for this location and will keep doing so as long as they continue to provide good service!"}
{"text":"This location doesn't ever want to honor the discount or reward programs that corporate probably sets up! In the past when they used to have stamp cards, this location refused to honor the free smoothie when all the holes were punched because a couple of the punches came from another location (they knew that because each punch was a specific number, probably for their store). So they moved to a text based program some time ago, and yesterday I got this text: TSmoothie702: Halloween only, one free kids smoothie for any kid in costume. I shouldn't have wasted my time going to this location, but I did. My three children and I went in, in full costume and expecting to get over or two other smoothies in addition to the free ones, and the girl behind the counter argued it was one per family. Ridiculous! So I went up the street to the nicer, better location. The only reason why I give two stars is because the smoothie recipes, which I hope the employees are not at liberty to alter, are still pretty good."}
{"text":"The young female employee was not helpful when asked about menu items and sat the whole time talking to a friend who had pulled up a chair and was sitting at the ordering counter. The fruit cup had very old browning and unattractive fruit. It is a weekday at noon and she told us she was out of the sandwich side kale salad. The wraps were good but the employee was awful.  Same employee cooks that takes orders and she has really long nails that I can't imagine are hygienic from a food prep standpoint. I hope she wore gloves but it is impossible to know as there is a divider wall food is prepped behind.  No spoken words were initiated on her part or even acknowledgement of our presence, had to ask for my receipt upon leaving. Felt very unwelcome. The second we walked out she and her friend were on our heels out the door to the bench out front for cigarettes. This was our second visit and second  with poor service we are done and won't be back."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Tropical Smoothie Cafe ever. Just got two smoothies mango magic and sunny day and let me tell you it tasted like just crushed ice and sugar or may be worse. No flavor whatsoever. Went straight to Starbucks from there which is like 100ft away. Corporate should really look in to this location. It's a joke !!!"}
{"text":"Great food (my order was wrong but I still ate it),...but the soda I ordered was expired.AMZING smoothies!  Not a big deal because I didn't complain about anything I just would like to get what I pay for."}
{"text":"Every smoothie I have tried here is one of the best I have ever had! Only thing I would change would be to add supplements to the drinks free of charge. Also, I don't think they have wheatgrass... :[ The sandwiches and flatbreads are yummy too."}
{"text":"I've never been here and didn't have to wait 30 mins. Of there is anyone in line avoid unless you have 45 mins to kill. 24hrs is nice only it is even slower at night. Kids give poor service. Tropical smoothie is good just avoid this location."}
{"text":"I honestly love tropical smoothie!! But what drives me nuts is that the drive thru is so slow! I was seriously in my car for over ten minutes and I had to honk for the girl to come out. And she told me she forgot about me (what the hell) and even forgot my order. I had to tell her my order and she even gave me my drink super messy. Tropical smoothie has good smoothies , it's just the drive thru sucks.... it's the drive thru for a reason...."}
{"text":"I come here almost every morning for my breakfast smoothie. Staff is always friendly and the smoothies and always good. They are much cheaper then other smoothie places and you get more. I personally think they taste better as well. They also allow you to change up the ingredients in the smoothies to you liking."}
{"text":"Why does this location always only have one person working I swear. They are always out of things and when there are more than one person here they are slow as hell. I dont know what the problem is but please fix this issue."}
{"text":"Love this place, great service and great smoothies.  My favorite is the Detox Island Green and a new one that I believe is a temporary special. It's a breakfast Chia smoothie but I think it's good for anytime of day.  My pics show the exact ingredient but from memory it has chia seeds, roasted bananas, coconut. almonds, whole oats, dates and cinnamon and then you can decide to add peanut butter or two other fruit choices that I can't recall.  I chose Peanut Butter.  I could seriously go back everyday to have that.  Try it!  My daughter had the Blimey Limey and it was nice and limey.  Definitely support this business, they have a great product.  I took away one star because the décor of this location isn't one that makes you want to stay and eat and drink.  I've been to one in Ballantyne Commons several times before discovering this one and their décor is bright and happy, crisp and clean and very inviting.
But the smoothies are just as good.  I haven't tried the sandwiches at this location but I will and then I'll update my review.
Enjoy!  That is all!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE. 

I went today drive thru, asked for 2 chicken pesto flatbread, pulled to the window, paid and waited 15 minutes. Finally a team member opens the deive thru window and tells me: umm we are out of pesto.  

Mind you, they had already charged me!

I asked for my money back, this person closed the window again, 10 minutes later says: oh nevermind,  I found some pesto, here you go. 

I don't know what kind of training is required, but I most definitely DO NOT trust someone who tells me they \"just found some pesto\" and threw it on my flatbread. 

I am very disappointed to say the least. I did not eat the flatbread and wasted $20. That was my last time at tropical smoothie."}
{"text":"Online and posted outside of there window it says they close later I went about 8:14 and they just decided to close early and the person inside wouldnt even look at me and it sucks because I drove all the way up there for nothing total disappointment and I had just been to this location earlier this week. i will just go to camelback location they've always been consistent with food,smoothies and TIMEs !!"}
{"text":"This place has terrible customer service. Lines out the door run by kids who don't know what they are doing and it's always dirty. Also any sandwiches are always thrown together and majority of times order comes out wrong. Sad to see!!!"}
{"text":"Great smoothies, and the customer service I've received has been great. Always come in the mornings around 8-830 and have never had any issues. Have gotten to a point to where the lady knows my order."}
{"text":"Stay way from this place at this time.  Four people working and it is taking the. 20 minutes to count a drawer.   I'm the only one in the place.  Can't leave as I can't pay.  These people can not count."}
{"text":"I walked into tropical smoothie today and while waiting to pay for my smoothie I looked up and seen this... Niger fagut, it was behind the counter where a customer couldn't have placed it. I asked the cashier to take it down and he did after laughing so I asked to speak to the manager. When I asked him about how do he feel about things like this getting placed in his establishment he Shrugged his shoulders and stated I don't know how that got there as if it was nothing. When I told him I would be calling the corporate office, he just threw his hands in the air. Needless to say they will not be getting any more of my business. Update, I was contacted by two people from the management team and they both offered an apology, a free smoothie and to let me know they \"had a discussions\" with the manager. This was a bigger slap in my face. #tropicalsmoothie I don't need your handouts."}
{"text":"I love the smoothies here! I get mine with splenda and sometimes add protein and I don't feel guilty at all when I treat myself to something that tastes this delicious. I love the happy hour too."}
{"text":"Seriously this place is a joke.  First time going there today... Don't waste your money or time. I stopped to get my son and I lunch and a smoothie. The guy at the register didn't know crap about the menu when I asked simple questions and he was kind of rude saying \"whatever it says on the menu\" well it doesn't say on the menu that's why I freaking asked. Don't offer food if you don't know shit about it. Every baby high chair was broken. No napkins out. Food wasn't even cooked all the way and I'm pretty sure it just required them to press a button and heat it up. My sons \"pizza quesadilla\" was room temperature and the cheese wasn't melted at all. I Was going to get him a smoothie as a special treat after lunch but went to nektar smoothies instead because after the shitty food and shitty service it wasn't worth trying. Awful service and pathetic food... this place should be out of business"}
{"text":"This place just needs to be shut down. The owner is a jerk and will give you attitude throughout your order or even talk on the phone while he puts your order in. Never makes eye contact and will move you out of the line and let people cut in front of you if you don't talk quickly enough. The last time I came in, a woman at the register was very frowny faced and not friendly in taking my order, then put my name in incorrectly and walked off. I then received a soggy sandwich and two smoothies that weren't made well. Don't bother with this place. It's not worth getting treated like a transaction instead of a person and even the employees don't seem to want to be there."}
{"text":"Stood in line for 20 minutes with one person front of me. During that time no orders were taken and no smoothies came out for people that all ready ordered. Well this gave me plenty of time to look around. This place is filthy! The final straw was when I looked up to see a C rating from the health department on the wall. Seriously with some basic house keeping the health department would rank a restaurant at least a B. That was it for me and I walked out. 
With so many tropical smoothie locations around town your better off going somewhere else. FYI the one on Jones and 215 is nice I go to that one a lot, fast friendly service."}
{"text":"I enjoy the shakes but the owners of this place ruin the experience. I believe they are two brothers that need a serious attitude change. I mean common.. charging $5 for a ice smoothie that costs you 50 Cents aren't you making enough. Stop being so stingy smile and be happy that you are ripping people off. I think that shouldn't be too difficult."}
{"text":"The Thai chicken wrap and salad are very good. Same goes for the smoothies. Prices are decent"}
{"text":"If there are two things I love they are wraps and smoothies. If you crave either, for a chain restaurant, you can't do much better than this. The Buffalo Chicken Wrap is phenomenal. If you like spicy food then go for it. I also am a big fan of their King Caesar Wrap. As far as the smoothies go, you pretty much can't go wrong with whatever you pick. They have meal replacement smoothies, healthy smoothies, fruity smoothies, and dessert smoothies. You can add protein powder to any smoothie and a variety of other healthy stuff as well. Do yourself a favor and try one next time you get a chance."}
{"text":"Not really much to add other than what people already know. But don't forget, you can get your drinks without sugar or sweetener-free! You can cut out a ton of calories by using Splenda. Regular Blimey Limey = 210 calories!"}
{"text":"The space and ample, nice and clean! Service was friendly and our smoothies were tasty. My husband said his sandwich was decent as well. It's good to have healthy options around. I really hope it sticks!"}
{"text":"I have to agree with all the one star reviews. This location is a DUMP! It's dirty inside & out.  It's gross! The outside table hasn't been cleaned in years. But my kid had to have a smoothie for old time sake as we always went there in AZ. The service was slow and drinks were ok. Find another location if possible."}
{"text":"Prices are good, service was great and the smoothies are amazing!  I didn't know The store was over here.  I just happen to see it.  The ladies at the window were so polite and professional.  Their smoothie prices are reasonable and I'm kinda in love with my smoothie!"}
{"text":"I just tried TSC for the first time after I was given a gift card for there. My boyfriend and I ordered two sandwiches, chips, and waters. The young guy at the front counter was very nice.  However, that's about the only positive thing I can say about this place.

After ordering, my boyfriend and I sat down and waited for our food. A girl came out from the back and called out my name. Both my boyfriend and I heard it. My boyfriend went to get the food and it was in a bag, which confused me because I told them it was dine in. There were 2 sandwiches inside, so I figured it was ours and there was a mix up about whether we were dining in or taking out, which wasn't a big deal. We weren't given our chips or drinks, though, so my boyfriend went back up to the front counter and asked for them. It was then that a conversation ensued where the girl from the back told my boyfriend she did not call my name (which she very clearly did), and that we took the wrong order. My boyfriend told her that no, she did, in fact, call out my name and not another person's. The girl argued with him about it and completely denied that she called out the wrong name. I thought that was poor customer service. I wish we had a recorder so this girl could have heard that she totally called out the wrong name for the order This was not our mistake. They gave the other customer that was waiting her correct food, and someone else brought us our food out.

I had ordered a pesto chicken flatbread and I literally had to take out 75% of the chicken. It was tough, which made me think that either it was super fatty or under-cooked. At that point, I didn't even want to mess with the employees there, so I just took it out and munched on my bread, cheese, and tomatoes. It was a super disappointing meal. Definitely not worth almost $8.

Another thing that I thought was odd was that my boyfriend and I ordered bottled waters and they gave us two different brands of water. I got Nestle and he got Aquafina. Sorry, but bottled water brands can taste different, and I feel like each customer should be served as consistently as another.

Overall, this place was a major disappointment. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Sooooo slow. Ordered a smoothie and wrap, waited 10 min for the wrap only to find out they forgot about it and hadn't even started making it yet. Workers were talking and on their phone instead of working. Very disappointed in the service. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Worst place ever!! Waited About 30 mins and ended having to reverse out of the drive thru  along with 2 other cars and never got my food."}
{"text":"I just waited 15 minutes, was the only person in line in the place and still never got to put an order in. Having only 2 employees working who decided to hide in the back at lunch time is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Delicious Smoothies, but why one size???


My beef with this smooth criminal is that there is only one size smoothie to order, and that size is HUGE-NORMOUS.  I have never finished a smoothie from here, and when they are frozen they get icy and lose their appeal.  Offering a smaller size would be an easy thing to do, and I imagine more profitable as well.

The drive-through line is usually very slow here as well, since the food takes a few minutes to assemble.  

The food is ok, the smoothies are fantastic, just too big.  

Come on, I know us Americans are big, but can't we get a little less lovin' sometimes Tropical Smoothie Cafe??"}
{"text":"From the dining area to the bathroom, this establishment was DIRTY. 
After reading the reviews and seeing the restaurant for myself I am amazed that stay are still in business.   
This problem could easily be corrected, but has not been and that is disturbing. If you cant keep the areas clean where customers are, how clean are you keeping the food prep area?"}
{"text":"Yes CJ F. is correct only I think it has to do with who is making your smoothie as I got one this morning as I wanted something to put me in a better mood than I was in but I had to throw away my $7 smoothie as it was more of a juice. They should really pay attention to how much ice they put in it cause the girl put to much, but the gentlemen that did the last ones came out awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and great prices! This was my first visit to this little place and I couldn't be happier with my breakfast choices! The staff was more than helpful explaining the different smoothies and sandwiches! I chose the island green smoothie and a buffalo breakfast sandwich. The smoothie was huge and priced at under $5- a big plus! The sandwich was warm and flavorful and had a good amount of egg and bacon. My total for both was $7.30- price-wise, you can't beat this place!

I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is not designed well, there's tables right in front of the cash registers so if a line forms it's all over the place and people are all over the place. Plus it has a funky smell, maybe it just needs better ventilation? Besides that smoothies are ok. Never tried any of the food."}
{"text":"The food and smoothies are delicious, but the service sucks. The kids that work here frequently mess around and gossip while customers wait, they talk about customers negatively within earshot, and take their sweet time making the food. They have forgotten about food orders several times, and care more about the friends they work with than their jobs. Very, very disappointing."}
{"text":"Smoothies are great, but the service is horrible. Every time we go here they always seem short staff and always have something wrong with their food service (eg. food out of stock or kitchen out of service). On top of that, I've been in line for a little over ten minutes and two customers have already walked out because of the long wait and the other one was annoyed because they charged her something they didn't have in stock. 

×UPDATE - Its been fifteen minutes, I've been second in line and still haven't ordered."}
{"text":"Since I've been waiting 15 minutes for my smoothie I'll be productive and write this review. If you see more than one car in line, turn around and don't waste your time. However if there is no line, go ahead and order an immune blast smoothie."}
{"text":"Never again. The only reason I came in is because this location is the closest food establishment to my job. I thoroughly regret this decision, spent 25 minutes waiting for a smoothie and wrap. I watched the staff botch 4 orders during my wait time and the dining area was filthy. My experience isn't the only bad taste in my mouth either, smoothie tastes really watered down and this wrap is awful. I'm so blown away by my experience, I'm using the remaining 25 minutes of my lunch to write this. Don't come here, just don't."}
{"text":"Went in 35 min (8:25) before closing time and the doors were locked. It should not say they close at 9:00, if they are just going to lock up before. I understand 5-10 min before, but 35 no."}
{"text":"Good food but why people that work here seem like they hate their jobs no hi or how's your day or have a nice day just a life less staff I love this place but have some good customer service"}
{"text":"Tropical smoothie has really yummy food but for some reason, they are ALWAYS SLOW. It doesn't matter which one I go to in town!! Whenever I go there are never more than two people working. TWO PEOPLE. Considering every smoothie is made to order, this is very inefficient to only have two workers. Whether I go through a drive thru or walk in, the line is never crazy long but the wait has been up to a half hour!! One time I drove up to a drive thru and the girl just told me \"we're closed\" even though there were 3 cars ahead of me. She then explained that she was the only one there and couldn't take on anymore orders. C'mon TSC- get more workers in there!"}
{"text":"I created a Yelp account just to give this place a review. They have horrible service. They don't even deserve the one star that I am forced to give them. I emailed them two months ago informing them about the lack of customer service and they never got back to me. Bad business all around. Long wait times (one time they never even acknowledged me in the drive thru after about 15 minutes and I ended up driving off) and constantly out of products. Haven't been in months. I don't plan on ever going back to a Tropical Smoothie. Hi Jamba Juice"}
{"text":"The service here is very slow. I have been to this location a few times, and I notice that service is continuously slow and they tend to get orders wrong."}
{"text":"While this location has very tasty wraps and smoothies there is always some major problem with service. On one visit there was no lettuce for any of the sandwiches. A different visit the ovens were broken but the employees said nothing until we tried to order.  Even on a good day it takes 20 minutes to get your food because the cooks in the back seem to be extremely disorganized"}
{"text":"Avoid this place with every ounce of will power you have , it is never fast , I won't go there anymore but I have given it a few more try's and now I am done . 

2 people ahead of me and it took 42 minutes for a smoothie and drink , absolutely ridiculous . 

Go to a different one ."}
{"text":"There is a line of people going almost out the door and not enough employees to handle them. There is one making sandwiches ( with headphones in so she can ignore the customers) and one making the smoothies. They might want to get another one to help the customers as they come in. I stood at the counter waiting to be help for about 10min without one of the 2 employees even acknowledging that I was there. I got frustrated and left after that without getting any food. I wonder how much business they have lost that way? Go to Jamba Juice they have a lot better customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Im really upset with my latest visit to this place. I usually always go here ! I made a common mistake and missed the speaker where you order. I asked nicely if i could order there at the window and this middle age woman answered in the most horrible attitude and took my card and slammed the window ! She handed me the drink and said goodbye once again in a horrible attitude. I get it i would be a little upset but one must not act like that with a customer . So yeah really bad customer service !"}
{"text":"The employees are nice, and do what they are supposed to for the most part, but no one should get good rating for barely doing the absolute minimum. Couldn't even go in today becuase it's closed with a \"be back soon\" sign. No Wi-Fi here only becuase no one knows the password and after weeks of asking for it, I realized they just don't care. So if you don't care where you eat, this place is fine, unless it's closed during business hours like right now."}
{"text":"I love this place - great smoothies and food but I can't stand how slow everyone is and how there is always something they don't have. Tonight they didn't have Romaine lettuce. Seriously???? Lettuce?? Not very happy it's making me not want to come back."}
{"text":"Please help me understand why I entered the store this morning and instead of hearing \"Good morning, welcome to Tropical Smoothie\" I hear \"Do you have a credit card\"?  Then he proceeds to continue about his business once I say I'm getting my free smoothie. I see him drop something by mistake in the trash can ab d reach in to get it.  Then he walks back out to take my order?!  No sir. I had to ask him to wash his hands first and he almost started to comment like he didn't understand why. This place would not be a stop on my list if this smoothie wasn't free."}
{"text":"Tropical smoothie cafe is one of my favorite places to go. I usually go to the one downtown... however this location is fairly new and just opened this past July. My smoothie is always great but I ordered the chicken pesto twice and for whatever reason it has no flavor... you can barely taste the pesto at all. I've even been to the one in Winston Salem and that flat bread is amazing as well as down town and ballantyne. I wonder if they are missing an ingredient because there is no way that is the same flat bread. And this time I waited about 30 mins just to get my flat bread. A lot of other people were waiting a long time as well and they were highly aggravated."}
{"text":"The young lady that works here is great.  Why she is working by herself, making drinks, making sandwiches, accepting a delivery by Sysco on a Saturday at 2:30 pm, with people on line waiting to order????   Hey owner - get your shit together."}
{"text":"My first experience here was great. The smoothies were larger than expected (enough for two people) and fairly priced. However, during my second visit I showed up about 10 minutes before the lobby closed and was locked out upon walking up to the door. The young worker responded with \"our drive through is open 24/7\"... Mind you I walked there. A few days later I rode by on my bike after \"lobby hours\" and decided to go through the drive through. After sitting for 5 minutes with no service I decided to let the 2 cars behind me try....they were immediately served. Not only did the worker ignore me because I was on a bike but she let other customers sit instead of telling me she wouldnt serve me. I then rode back up to the screen and she looked at me through the window and said her little welcome speech and asked what I would like to order. After stating what I wanted she said \"Are you on a bike? I cant serve you. Same as my walk through policy\" ... And that was that. As if I know their policies. Needless to say I won't be back. Doesnt matter how good the product is if you treat your customers like crap."}
{"text":"I mean, what else is there to say? If your reading this or if you have read any other reviews then you already know that this is Gods Gift To Earth! Plain and simple, the girls are fast...the food is delicious and the smoothies are always perfect...I've never once been here and got the wrong order. This establishment has me for life, I drive across town 20 miles just to come to this location, refuse to go anywhere else..."}
{"text":"Workers were friendly, but there was only two of them during lunch time (understaffed).  I had heard that this place takes forever and needs more help.  Well it's true. I asked one of the workers why they don't have three people and she said that the owner knows about it but won't do anything about it. This place is super slow, but it's because they are understaffed. We waited probably 15 minutes to order."}
{"text":"Thank you to the young man behind the counter busy as always, but thank you for acknowledging me. Had to wait approx 10 minutes before getting my drink made. Went to the RR came back drink was on the house thank you again I will be back great customer service young man dressed all black"}
{"text":"Sweet people, great quality in smoothies. Found out that the cali chicken club Flatbread is a better version if the normal chicken Caesar wrap, but still enjoyed it. Not as many employees as there probably ahould be with drive thru and walkins-could come here again!"}
{"text":"Tropical Smoothie has more than just smoothies!  Who knew?

I had a very good Thai Chicken wrap for lunch and the kids had flat bread cheese pizzas. The pizzas were only okay, but the kids didn't seem to care. They shared a Blimey Limey smoothie, which was delicious! 

Although they advertise themselves as healthy, you still have to be very careful here.  Nevertheless, far more healthy choices than your average fast food stop. Happy to have Tropical Smoothie as a new option."}
{"text":"Of all the times I've been to. TSC this one was disappointing.  My smoothie tasted like sour water.  No flavor at all.  I always get the acai berry boost, and today it was sour, watered down with no real flavor! Never coming to this location again!

Not to mention when I walked in they were blasting music, and the place was dirty!"}
{"text":"Would have given less than a star, however am unable to.
I'll keep this short and to the point.  I have had the most disgusting, watery (is that a word?) smoothie's during my last three (3) visits here. 
Whether an Acai Berry or Peanut Paradise smoothie, you'll just be drinking crushed ice with the applicable flavor.
Do not.  Do not.  One more time....Do not go here.  Try a different location."}
{"text":"This is the best I love that it's 24 hours. My schedule is always different sometimes I get off late from work and I always drive past this location so convenient"}
{"text":"Have been sitting in the drive through line for twenty five minutes now, waiting for two smoothies. It's Labor Day and the place isn't even busy, but it seems like there's only one or two people working. They seem to be doing the best they can, but we could have gone somewhere for a sit-down meal at this point. 

Would have given two stars but at least the guy at the drive through window was friendly."}
{"text":"Location has gone way downhill over the last few months they don't open on time leave signs on the door stating they will be open late and don't open at all.
I waited outside for over an hour one day along with 5-6 other customers and an employee and the manager never showed up. Next time I went in I said something and all I got was a we had maintenance being done. Yet the whole time I was there no one was in the building working"}
{"text":"Completely HORRIBLE drive thru experience! Waited about 20mins in the drive-thru during my lunch break! While in line I called them and asked why was the line taking so long and not moving? I was thinking maybe computer difficulty or register problems, idk.. They said their current customer had a large order, then she went ahead and ordered a lot more when she was going to pay! HELLO?! MAKE HER PARK and come in! Other fast food drive thrus even have a special parking spot for drive thru customers with longer waits!!  Isn't the purpose of a drive thru for convenience?all that waiting for one customer? They are inconsiderate of the other waiting cars, I mean they know her order is taking long- a bunch of sandwiches!  So on this phone call I asked why didn't you guys have her park? They went and said \"oh yea I guess we should've done that\"... OMG I wish there was a way I could've just drove away but I was sandwiched between cars :/. Absolutely unacceptable. This establishment should know better."}
{"text":"Fast service, like the selection of smoothies. Clean place but music is way too loud!"}
{"text":"Third time here and after 3 chances I'm never coming back. Got to the drive thru and no one bothered to come on the speaker to tell me that it would be a moment. I said hello I'm ready to order and this rude voice comes on saying \"we are really busy right now so it will be a minute!\" Wow! Really?? Then When I order and finally get to the window the girl asks me what I ordered. If there wasn't a car in front of me and behind me I would've left. And Don't ever believe them if u want to pay with a credit card and they say the machine is down....its there way of pocketing your money. They try and give you a deal after happy hour and when you pull up with a card you get a response of \"oh I thought you were paying cash\". I hope I can find out the DM for this location. Do yourself a favor and just make a smoothie at home."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible smoothies are made with water.. Go down the road to Dairy Queen and get a better smoothie"}
{"text":"I love my fruit smoothies, and this location is conveniently located between my bf's place and work.  The staff is friendly, service is quick.  It's healthy and delicious, and the price is right.  All-American breakfast wrap is quite tasty, too."}
{"text":"This location on W Sahara is my favorite.  I started stopping in between school and work, usually Wednesday mornings.  The staff is consistent- polite, smiling, sociable.  And they get my order to me in just the right amount of time so that I'm not late to work!  Fresh fruit smoothies are always a welcome addition to my day- the sunny day smoothie, with blueberry instead of kiwi (stupid allergy)- always tasty!"}
{"text":"I've had been going to this location for 3 or 4 years. The service had always been a crap shoot depending on the time of day. Friendly, passive, could care less attitude, etc. 
The new black dude was so rude that during my last trip that I will probably never go back.
I'm a black man, partly raised on the south side of Chicago to help with perspective."}
{"text":"This smoothies here are delicious! I love, love, love the blimey limey! It has the right amount of sweetness with a little tart kick at the end. You can call ahead too, and they will have it ready and waiting for you. If only they had a drive-thru! 

The food quality isn't the greatest, but it's not bad. I like the buffalo chicken wrap."}
{"text":"Well no surprises here, I go to get on here to give this place a 0 star review if I could and it's 2 star business. Line was out the door and they only had one employee that I could see working felt bad for her but obviously this is mismanaged poorly owned operation hopefully there's new management soon. Save yourself the time and go right down the street to Jamba Juice."}
{"text":"Congratulations! It looked like a very successful grand opening. Long ass wait for 3 drinks but then again I can't complain since they only 99c!"}
{"text":"The staff that made my smoothie and meal were amazing but this is strictly for the management team who sets them up for failure. I stopped by on Sunday morning to order a flat bread meal but they were out of flat bread and bacon. I show up today hoping that they would have it but I was wrong and they ran out of Thai sauce. I felt bad for the employee because she had to apologize multiple times for the items she didn't have. So to the management team please keep track of what you have in stock because you will slowly lose customers."}
{"text":"I love the smoothies here but this location has the worst customer service. We've been here more than once and the first couple times we just figured they were having a bad day but every single time we come here everyone is so unpleasant. Nobody is ever smiling or engaging, we never get greeted upon entering and when we're checking out the guy who is there like all the time can't even look at you when he's ringing you up."}
{"text":"Just left this place. Should have checked Yelp before going. \"C\" rating from the health department. The girl taking our order was itching her scalp and wiping her nose with her forearm multiple times. Then she went back to make smoothies. Thank God she didn't make ours. However, the smoothies we received had very little taste at all. Mostly ice. You would think that a franchise like this one would have a consistent product. We go to Tropical Smoothie Cafe two or three times a week in other locations and they are all great. Will not be back to this one ever."}
{"text":"Horrible service, wouldn't even pick up the phone and when we went they were just plain rude and messed up our order twice. Won't ever visit this location again. Hope they get some new employees who actually care a bit about their job."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed first the drink that I ordered didn't have all the ingredients. then I ordered a hummus bowl and I kid you not they forgot the hummus  for $13 I feel like I just got robbed."}
{"text":"I love this place as I frequent it regularly for lunch. They have great smoothies and sandwiches and wraps. My only complaint is the time it takes to make your order. I have waited up to 20 minutes in line waiting for my order. I love the staff and food though so I keep coming back. If they sped up the orders I would frequent here more often."}
{"text":"It seriously bums me out that it takes a half hour to get a smoothie here. Wasted my whole lunch break from work waiting....for one smoothie. And with one person in line in front of me."}
{"text":"So this is the second time I've TRIED to order something and just drove away. I'm pregnant and I ask them about sweeteners, if you're a mother u know some sweeteners u want to stay away from when ur pregnant. So I try to order a smoothie and first she doesn't even know what comes inside of it, she tried telling me there's no sugar when I know there is because other multiple workers have told me and other locations as well. I'm telling her no Splenda and she goes ok so u want Splenda I'm like girl just forget it. Such a waste of time. I love every other location but this one I would skip out on. Definitely go to another where they taste the same everyday and the workers actually know what they're talking about."}
{"text":"If I could give this location no stars I would. I've given this location three tries now and EVERY time something is missing from my order or made wrong. I am currently sitting at the drive thru window. I ordered a spinach and feta omelette wrap and a smoothie. I had to come back because they didn't put any egg in the spinach and feta OMELETTE wrap. No apology. Nothing. Just a \"Oh, I can remake it for you.\" Ridiculous. Awful customer service. I will never come to this location again."}
{"text":"Used to go here once a week and the peanut paradise smoothie was my favorite after a work out. This place has gone down hill over the last year though. Our kids smoothies are so bland and ours taste like ice with protein in it. Worth driving the extra mile to get one at another smoothie place."}
{"text":"Tropical Smoothie Cafe has always had amazing smoothies and food. I started going there about 3 or 4 years ago at a different location and after they closed they opened up a location near to me. They have a variety of smoothies and food that is used with ACTUAL fruit, not the fake stuff. They usually fill you right up because of the size and there is always amazing flavor in your smoothie. My favorite is the Orange Dream."}
{"text":"Ordered a pomegranate plunge, color was very light pink, was like they never added any pomegranate. Had no flavor whatsoever, my least favorite location for Tropical Smoothie, won't be back, ever"}
{"text":"This place toggles between a 1 star & a 5 star rating constantly. I frequent this location often, as it's 24 hours & is literally less than a mile away. Sometimes the experience is fantastic, sometimes it's abysmal... It's a gamble honestly. Welcome to Vegas!

I've had good experiences here, but also many bad -- where we came home finding missing ingredients from our salads or wraps, or where my smoothie tastes nothing like it should have. Once I came home to find no chicken in my thai chicken salad. What? Or sometimes half of my order just isn't in the bag at all! I know it's literally only 0.9 miles away, but having to go back can be tedious and extremely annoying when you've already made it back home and are ready to grub. Another time I went back because my bahama mama smoothie tasted odd... and when I went back & said this, the girl said, \"Oh, it's because we are out of white chocolate and there isn't any in there. It's one of the main ingredients.\" Oh. Okay. That would have been great to know so I could have ordered something else rather than get stuck with something that caught me off guard. Not even an apology too? Simple customer service.

Ah, my favorite instance was when I went with my boyfriend's brother who was in full uniform as active military and we went through the drive thru one late night. The man at the window was not only rude from start to finish, but he refused to give us the 50% off that it said in plain sight ON the window. We even pointed to it posted right next to him. He said he could give us 15% off, take it or leave it. He was very agitated and hostile, I had never experienced anything like this in my life. We returned the next morning to speak with a manager, to get a refund for the other 35% off and complain about the encounter. The manager apologized and not only refunded our money entirely, but she gave us the same order from yesterday for free again right then and there. This was amazing and beyond what we had expected. Do you see what I mean about the variation of experiences? Extreme highs, extreme lows.

It's hard to say honestly... there are pros & cons. I think this place has a two star rating for a reason, so I'm probably being generous by giving an average of 3 really. 

FOR HER: 
- Bahama mama smoothie
- Ultimate club sandwich
FOR HIM: 
- Peanut Butter Cup smoothie
- Thai Chicken wrap (or salad)"}
{"text":"Ordered my usual peanut butter cup smoothie. The smoothie was average not a creamy as they typically are when I order then from Tropical Smoothie Cafe. Still good even through it was more of a slushy rather than a smoothie. :) 

The disappointing part was that when I walked up to the counter to place my order I was looked at by what appeared to be a teenager who lacked customer service experience. She immediately didn't ask me what I would like and I blankly stared back at her until she got my hint. She finally asked what I wanted to order. The level of customer service flowing in this place is so subpar it is ridiculous. This Tropical Smoothie Cafe location could be generating much more revenue if someone higher up gave a damn about customer service."}
{"text":"5 stars for the product that was on point. It was the 2 stars for the lack of service. I felt as if I wasn't doing anyone any favors by walking in the door today, I got the blank stare by Asia who failed to greet with a simple hello, smile, nothing. I asked for my smoothie, paid, and sat down to wait. It was a painful and awkward experience. I almost would have rather drove the extra time and miles to go through a TSC drive through to avoid the lack of friendly service again."}
{"text":"Whoever the two little teenage girls were that worked there tonight (9:20 pm) need to take a customer service class. Rude, snobby, no manners & dis-respectful. When someone says thank you, don't you say you're welcome?! I don't know what kind of training you do before you get hired but clearly they didn't get any."}
{"text":"I don't like coming here during the day time, because most of the time they make my smoothie taste weird or watery. Tonight I came in with my friend, and had the best experience ever. AJ really helped us out, and made sure our smoothies had flavor. He seemed so enthusiastic and made sure we liked our smoothies, every one else here doesn't seem to care or they just take wayyyy too long to take our order or make our smoothies."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's always clean, and the staff is very friendly. Their prices are amazing at breakfast time, and for about five bucks I can get a breakfast big enough to share with my boyfriend. The wake up wrap is quite possibly the best version of a breakfast burrito ever made, and their green smoothies are really good. 

They just added a new perfectly green smoothie, and it is fantastic. So fantastic that I want to go back tomorrow and get it again. Their smoothies only come in one size: huge, hence the sharing. I'd give it five stars but service can be a little slow."}
{"text":"Open 24/7 and has a drive thru which is convenient but you will wait for it, much faster service if you walk in. 

I love the smoothies here and it's not a bad place to grab a sandwich although some are better than others. Today they were out of my favorite, the feisty feta flat bread so I went with the hummus veggie wrap which had a nice kick to it and was big enough for two meals."}
{"text":"Got to try out this new location today and I'm so happy to finally have a Tropical Smoothie Cafe close to me! I tried the drive thru and waited a few minutes but didn't hear from anybody. I just pulled around and went inside. Glad that I did, everyone was super friendly and the smoothie was awesome as always. Thanks for opening over here"}
{"text":"Always come here for lunch and never had an issue! The cranberry white chocolate truffle is amazing btw."}
{"text":"Great smoothies. Awesome place to visit especially in the summer's. My favorite is Coconut Royale which is no longer on the menu but if you ask they'll still make it for you! They have sandwiches and stuff like that, too but the smoothies are where it's at."}
{"text":"1st visit to this location was... Decent but all the booths were dirty in one way or another... on my visit I was at the mercy of someone's personal playlist for the not so great music."}
{"text":"Everything here is good. Menu stays fresh with seasonal offerings as well as standards. Can't miss with any of the smoothies."}
{"text":"More than once I had to pull out of the driveway because service took more than five minutes to simply order (there weren't many cars.) Overall, the timeliness of this location needs to be worked on. Quality of food is the same as any other location, but it takes much longer for this location to push out orders than others in the valley."}
{"text":"I have been to this particular location more than once and on average my experiences were negative and unpleasant. I tried this tropical smoothie out because it was close to my house and was open 24 hours. Most of the times I have been here the customer service was slow and unfriendly, and on more than one occasion there have been missing ingredients to food and smoothies, such as no wontons for the Thai chicken salad/wrap, and no white chocolate for the Bahama Mama. For these negative experiences they have already started at 1 star, but some after the fact experiences have given me enough satisfaction to raise it to 2 stars. A detailed example one of my experiences is down below.

Being active military, I usually go here during the graveyard shift and every time there has been an incompetent brute with no manners serving me. From the minute I pull up to the voice box I am greeted with nothing for a minute, and then mumbled words spit out from the speaker. I decide to start ordering and then the speaker says clearly \"Wait, I ain't ready.\" With no common courtesy to ask me to please wait; and when he says he is ready there was no \"Sorry for the wait, how can I help you?\" Instead, I get an \"Alright, order.\" When I get to the window after I order, I'm given the total and ask the man for the 50% discount for uniformed members of the military and government services, which is clearly posted on the outside of the drive thru window. He responds with \"I don't know how to do that, I just press the button on this register for military, sorry.\" This military discount was only 15% off which is a drastic difference from the promised 50% off THAT IS POSTED RIGHT THERE, on the drive thru window. I tried to explain I frequent this location multiple times a month and have never had a problem. I stated I would like to talk with a manager and he told me \"Well you have to wait three hours cause she doesn't come in until 4:00 AM.\" So I got my order and left, this whole tropical smoothie experience lasted for 30 minutes which is a ridiculous amount of time to wait for a drive thru food service, especially during a graveyard shift with no one inside or no one else at the drive thru. This man had the worst attitude, emulating that he did not want to be there and as if it wasn't part of his job to serve the customer with any kind of courtesy. 

There were two positives to the experience the food he gave us (2 Thai chicken wraps, 1 Thai chicken salad, 2 Mango smoothies) was full of their ingredients, such as a lot of wontons and chicken for the wraps and salads. The other positive was when I went back the next day to complain and inform the manager, she gave me a full refund and a whole order of the previous night's purchase."}
{"text":"This service is literally the slowest thing I have ever witnessed. First the man said through the drive thru, \"give me a minute.\" We waited for 10 minutes with multiple cars behind us. There was one person working which is probably the reason why it took so long. Second it took another 15 minutes to make the smoothies which doesn't make sense. Thirdly the clueless bastard smacked the smoothie up against the window and spilt most of the smoothie out and still handed it too us. The smoothie has too much liquid in it and tastes like soggy water from the amazon river. Jesus Christ it was so awful I wanted to drive back to the shop and smack the smoothie up against the window and drive away very pleased. DO NOT GET THE LEAN MACHINE WITHOUT SOY PROTEIN!!!! I am disgusted with this shop...."}
{"text":"Not sure why everyone is so fussy about this location, been here only a few times but the smoothies were great each time. I had been going to Jamba Juice but the people working there are losers so I found this place and haven't been happier."}
{"text":"I stopped going here couple  of months ago due to bad service. 

I went to drive thru and we waited 30 minutes and we had to leave because  im gonna be late for work.. and worst there was only 2 cars  ahead of us.. thats why you use drive thru so transaction would be smooth and fast..

I hope the manager reads all these bad comments .. if you dont train your people you're  going to lose customers.  And tropical smoothie promotes healthy living but with bad customer service in this specific location, na ah.. wont come back ever"}
{"text":"Better than the avocolata, only the service provided by this young gentleman behind the counter. He was very attentive and helpful, a real pleasure to talk to."}
{"text":"To all the people who are wondering if it takes just as long inside as it does for drive-thru, it does! I've been sitting here for over 20 minutes waiting and I have two people waiting in front of me. Every time I've ordered at this specific location the smoothies have tasted watered down and gross."}
{"text":"The banana chai smoothie with peach is bomb!!!  The only complaint I have with this place is that they take forever sometimes, even when it's not that packed......

That was my last review and I still love the smoothie and all of their food but I will not ever come back. The service is absolutely horrible!!! None of the employees care about their job and are not friendly at all. I stood at the register for 5 min waiting to order when there were 4
Employees behind the counter and 2 of them were standing in the back talking!!! They looked directly at me and saw me waiting. There was 2
People waiting at tables for their smoothies and it wasn't busy at all but with as long as it takes you would think you're ordering 20 smoothies!!! This business will not last if they don't train their employees betted and have better customer service. I am done with this place!"}
{"text":"Although the staff ended up being friendly, I waited a solid minute before even being greeted... and there was no one else in the place that morning. I counted three associates so that was interesting to me.

My order came out quickly, but the cleanliness the place was just so-so given the overall size. It also felt a little dark. There were two girls enjoying their meal outside when I walked in so now I know why! They didn't want to have breakfast in a messy dungeon."}
{"text":"The smoothie said naturally sweetened on the menu. That must be code for add a boat load of raw cane sugar... I was chewing and crunching the little sugar bits within seconds. It ruined the whole concept of drinking something healthy.. Id prefer a real juice shop.."}
{"text":"Two days in a row and no watermelon,  both times they said they just ran out. Believe it or not."}
{"text":"Excellent service and quality! Greeted with a smile and happiness on an early Sunday. Definitely  recommend this location over others near by."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely disgustingly dirty there was trash all over the tables and floor (I was the only person in there besides the two employees). Both employees were high out of their minds. one employee just kept staring at the wall with his mouth open and the other wouldn't even make eye contact at the register when I ordered my smoothie. The employee who took my order put all the ingredients in a blender and left it on the counter then made herself a smoothie and some food after she took care of herself she sat at a table and started her break. Only when I asked if someone was going to finish making my smoothie did the other employee blend everything up. After the smoothie was finished he set it on the counter with no straw and went back to staring at the wall. This location it a joke I should've read the reviews before going."}
{"text":"Ok so I went through the drive threw and placed my order I was the only one in line. Nobody in front or behind me the only one in line! I placed my order and it was repeated back to me correctly I pulled up to the window where I had to wait over 5 min for my order now I drive home promising my kids the  pizza from your kids menu and what did I get...
 Not pizza!!!! My order was wrong!!!

  Here is why you get one star from me

After throwing the wrong order away and making my kids dinner at home the way I should have. I placed in a call to this location to talk with the store manager where I was placed on hold and left to wait. Once you returned to the phone I was told that there was no manager on duty. So I explained the situation I have to the girl on the phone and she said that they are very sorry and that if I come back in tomorrow I can pick up the proper order.  

Here I am on the way home from school with my kids in the car and waiting in line at your store the next day. I placed the same order and told the lady my name and I was told to pull up to the window. That's when I get this little punk who decides to lean out the window and tell me that the store policy is that I have to bring the food back in if they make it wrong... trust and believe I tried to play it cool AND DROVE HOME 

But how about a change of policy!!!! 

MAKE THE FOOD THAT'S ORDERED CORRECTLY THE FIRST TIME!!!!!  That would be a good start 

Great customer service guys I really appreciate your lack of concern for us the customer. I will never be back and I'll be sure to bad mouth your store whenever the opportunity arises"}
{"text":"This place has the worst wait times, 15 mins to hold for someone to take your order and 20 min wait after that to get your smoothie. Then I get to window and get asked again what my order was, wtf ?!? This has happened 3 times I just don't get it. All other tropical smoothies are way better than this crappy place. Just don't waste your time here unless you like your time wasted"}
{"text":"The staff was playing inappropriate music loud enough for the lobby to hear. Every other word was the N word- How Terrible!! 
The wait to order and receive your food was way too long (not just for us but the customers before and after; even if only a smoothie was ordered. When the family after us was addressed the employee didn't use words to acknowledge the guests. He just nodded at them...) 
The food was alright, don't waste your time on the kale coleslaw.
.... the smoothies were good but we'll probably never go back. We would have called a manager but we didn't see anything posted with his/her number or a card"}
{"text":"If I could leave 0 stars I would. Worst customer service ever. How hard is it to walk from the back to take an order when a customer is waiting by the register? Apparently pretty hard as it takes 10+ minutes for them to do it."}
{"text":"Didn't let us go through drive through and pretend like we weren't there. Such mean employees. Don't appreciate their treatment so late at night when we were craving a nice healthy snack."}
{"text":"Just left after standing and waiting for service for 5 minutes at the counter. Both employees were standing in kitchen just ignoring me and talking and texting on phones. Last time I ever go into that place. If I could give no stars I would. Very disappointed because I love their food and smoothies. Guess I'm sticking to the summerlin store. Thanks for nothing"}
{"text":"I've been to several Tropical Smoothies both in Vegas and Florida and the smoothies are good and for the food, its So-so. Although, I do love the Peanut Butter, honey and granola flatbed. When they took it off the menu awhile back, I was super bummed. When they put it back on the menu, I was like \"right on!\".

 So today I ordered that flat bread, posted a pic and took a bite. Was good but the amount of honey was overwhelming. I had honey on my pant leg, my hands and even up by my shoulder. I felt like Winnie the pooh after finding a honey pot after hibernation. I literally saw honey pouring out of the wrapper. If I wasn't such a carefree person, I would have been upset. I kinda found it humorous and cleaned off by dousing my pants w water. So maybe I'll ask for 1/2 normal honey cuz u never know.

So my fave smoothies have always been coffee based. My go to is Mocha Madness. I used to do Cinn-City but that's now off menu. That's OK... I have a back up. Mocha Madness w regular coffee is my jam!"}
{"text":"Phone ordered a jerk wrap with beyond meat chicken which is the fake vegetarian meat.. pick it up, get all the way to work where I have to be with no food for 16 hours and no break, just to find out that they made the wrap with real chicken. THIS IS NOT OK, especially considering I have a meat allergen."}
{"text":"If you like to waste your time on Slow Service this is the place for you. Not prepared for lunch service. Still setting up at 12:30pm"}
{"text":"Slow ass service. They also suck at greeting too. Get more employees and a manager who cares."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I can give this place more than 3 stars for a few reasons. 

1. The ordering/pickup system is NOT well thought out, nor is it clearly marked/people don't pay enough attention for a system like this. When I came here, we ordered then got trapped in the back of the restaurant because the lunch line was taking over where it would be easiest to grab your food: down at the other end. Staff and customers can't easily get to one another and create efficiency. 
2. It's a chain. I'm not a HUGE chain fan and while they have their merits, they make me wonder, especially when they're branded as a \"healthy\" alternative. I'd rather go to a locally sourced tiny veggie stand to get my own fruit for a smoothie, or go to a unique one of a kind smoothie place. One where I can see my smoothie being made and it doesn't just appear to me. I saw some being grabbed out of a small refrigerator, which gave me the impression that some were pre-made, not fresh, and who knows what kind of sugars are added. Don't get me wrong, my smoothie was tasty! But a mystery...
3. The food is actually pretty good and I felt healthier than I would have if I had gotten some BK or McD's, but it certainly didn't taste fresh. The chicken on my flatbread seemed a little processed and when I unwrapped it a mere 3 minutes later (how long it took me to wade through the crowd and get to the outdoor seating), the bread was fairly soggy. Like the smoothie, it was tasty, but a little mysterious. 

I guess my issue is that I don't buy into the health aspect of it, but I do like this place, don't get me wrong. I'm just not sure it's worth the chaos and trouble of trying to get your food in a timely and sensible manner. I'll come back, but probably outside of the lunch time rush and see what happens. 

I'd like to add that we waited at least 15-20 minutes for 2 flatbreads and 2 smoothies, which came out at COMPLETELY different times, though they were ordered back to back. Confusion. Pure confusion."}
{"text":"Was refunded the full amount after an email. Went back to the location...and it turns out they now jacked the prices up across the board so every smoothie is over $6."}
{"text":"YUM!!!! The smoothies are really good (don't need the added sugar in them though)!!! Love that you can add greens and boosts to the smoothies. Their bowls are delicious!! I tried the hummus bowl and added chicken and it was excellent!!! New favorite place! Service was quick even when busy!"}
{"text":"Not sure if it was a change in management, the service has changed. The wait in drive thru is ridiculous. The drive to Ann and Simmions is kind of worth it."}
{"text":"This young lady great my daughter every morning, when we go in faithfully to get her and her friends smoothies before school starts. My daughter asked me if she could write her a letter. One day a few weeks back this young lady made the same two smoothies we order everyday (literally). On this particular day she made extra and gave it to my daughter. My daughter goes to school as usual and tells me she gave the extra to a random kid at school. The kid started to cry and told my daughter thank you. One act of kindness for this young lady, lead my kiddo to an act of kindness for a random kiddo at her school. Love,smiles and kindness are contagious 

Thank you"}
{"text":"This place is a hit or miss. Sometimes it's empty or one person in line, other times it's filled with team moms and a ton of kids. There is one person working and I think it has something to do with costs and the location. It would be nice for them to add another person during rush hours or weekends.

Other than that, never had a problem with the food or smoothies."}
{"text":"So I just waited about 30 minutes just for one smoothie and I'll be honest, I was irritated at first but the employees were actually working as fast as they could and even apologized about the wait. It wasn't even their fault, they were slammed so I just chose the worst possible time to go get my fix.

I've been going to Tropical Smoothie's in the valley for quite some time and I think this one is my favorite so far. Since starting their 24/7 hours, I have always been satisfied with product I receive.

I always get either PEANUT PARADISE or PEACHES N' SILK. Both are very good for a very reasonable price. All of their smoothies are always prepared very well and I have never left this location unhappy with my product. Especially with the Peanut Paradise, sometimes they skimp you on the peanut butter at other locations and the taste is just off. Here, it's just how I am expecting it each and every time. 

They even have delicious wraps that I would highly recommend. If I'm getting a wrap I get the KING CAESAR, TOTALLY TURKEY or the THAI CHICKEN WRAP. All are heeeeelllllllllaa good and are insanely filling. 

I will continue to come to this quality location as long as I live here and as long as it is open."}
{"text":"With a couple of visits to this location, service is typically backed up with a 10 minute wait for smoothies. Actual taste of the smoothies is okay, but flavors didn't seemed bland. Staff was friendly"}
{"text":"Only water and ice with some fruit mix as told by the employee behind the front desk yeah Next time Jamba Juice."}
{"text":"Slowest place ever. We ordered 3 smoothies and it took 20 minutes to get them. Young staff doesn't care and has poor customer service."}
{"text":"I use to go here but the service is incredibly slow. If you are in the drive thru expect to wait at least 15 minutes. If you have small kids it is not so fun. 

The smoothies are a little chalky tasting nothing great for the price. The sandwiches are actually pretty tasty. I just don't really think anything on the menu is worth the price. Your better off going to Starbucks for a panini. It is cheaper, faster and down the street."}
{"text":"The king caesar with any smoothie for ten bucks!!  I love this deal.  I eat it weekly!!!"}
{"text":"What's the use of coming through the \"drive thru\", when they make u wait for 10 minutes taking ur order then another 10 minutes giving ur order. And I'm only getting a smoothie. Smh it's hot out here! Should have went inside but im now stuck in between these cars"}
{"text":"The stars are for the taste. It's pretty expensive. Especially the food. I would go more often if it was cheaper. 
I had one that was just strawberry and banana. Forgot the name. Would give a 7/10
Tropicolada- 9/10
I've gone a few times and tried a few smoothies and I can't change my favorite tropicolada it's so delicious. Their food is super good. I love it. But I wish it was cheaper."}
{"text":"Ordered the Thai Peanut Chicken Bowl to go and got back to work to find they forgot the chicken, the noodles were mushy and there were about five leaves of spinach.  Terribly disappointing."}
{"text":"So far the best tropical smoothie location I've been to that's made my smoothie correctly first of all and actually taste good, didn't make me wait for two hours just to get it, customer service was on point! most locations take forever and the smoothie just taste horrible! Been to this location number of times, never seems to disappoint! Love that it's Drive-Thru... Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"How are all the ovens not working at the same time???? Also, the staff could smile a bit, if you hate mornings, don't work mornings."}
{"text":"Wow! How is a smoothie place out of yogurt? So get approval from the franchise owner and go get some! Really!! 
The women's bathroom is disgusting! As I sit and wait for my smoothie (they were out of peanut butter also) people are tired of waiting and want their money back. Not sure what is going on with this location, but don't come!"}
{"text":"Great service  for only having One employee  working on a Saturday  afternoon! 
Great food.
The young teenager was respectful  and informed me that there was a wait. 
I feel sorry for the employees  that work at this store."}
{"text":"Move over Starbucks! There's something better for your morning pick me up! White Chocolate Mocha Madness with Energizer and B12!!"}
{"text":"I live uptown but always go to this location when I'm near it.  Our smoothies are always top notch as well as the food.  I love the baja chicken flat bread.  

Last time I went, we did not realize they weren't open yet when we walked in but they served us anyway.  I believe the manager had gotten there early to start a special order and hadn't locked the door.  It was so nice of him to fill our order even when we offered to come back in an hour or so when they actually opened."}
{"text":"I normally love Trop! However, this location has horrible customer service. I waited for 5 minutes at the drive through order screen and when nobody asked for my order I pulled up to the window. The employee who came to the window acted like I bothered her and was unapologetic that it wasn't alerting her to the fact there were customers coming through the drive through. If it's not alerting you, then common sense would lead most to believe you should put up a sign on the drive through saying go to the window!"}
{"text":"I really like Tropical Smoothie and I appreciate that they are 24hrs. I have been getting the totally green for a couple of months and 92% of the time it tastes great. 8 % of the time it tastes like it missing some flavorful ingredient. I spoke with management and they insisted that they all make them the same. Can't be true. Maybe one day they don't have an ingredient and substitute it or something. It tastes like green water."}
{"text":"I've been giving 3-5 star reviews lately. My first 2 star review...I try to do give an honest and fair review based off of a couple of experiences...I've been to many Tropical Cafe Smoothies...this review is only in reference to this particular location...so each time that I went here, from entering to leaving has been nearly the same experience...I've gone here at different times of the day and each time, inside and outside the area looks pretty dirty. The neon lights weren't even on. You can see with my photo's that I've included...There's not 1 worker there that seems to like working there. Each time, while I'm in line, someone is talking about their personal life problems...In my opinion, it's ok to talk about whatever you want to talk about, when there's no customers around, but when there's customers. It's best to try to be as professional as you can. I get everyone gets a bad day every once in a while...I'm not knocking on the taste of my smoothie...because it's been consistent. I usually just get the Peanut Paradise with Whey protein........my location of preference would be either the one on Blue Diamond or the one on Las Vegas Blvd near the mall and Canes...It's weird how this location has pigeons, reminds me of the Bay Area, where I'm originally from, without that stank ocean smell........This location is in Summerlin... Summerlin I was told is like an upscale neighborhood vs North Las Vegas, Henderson and even Southern Highlands...just 2 stop lights up the street and the complex is completely clean. This location almost feels as if you're in North Las Vegas off Craig...but yeah, I also noticed there were a lot of low rating scores at this particular location...if you don't believe me. Feel free to check it out yourself..."}
{"text":"I've wondered why this place receives such poor reviews. My girlfriend and I have visited this place a few times before, each time going inside to order. However, today was my first time experiencing their drive-thru, and I must say I now get it. Just embarrassing how slow they are. I pulled up with an SUV in front of me and waited behind for a good 5 mins wondering what was going on. Come to find out, they were still waiting to place their order. Once they finished, I pull up and am immediately greeted with, \"Hello. Welcome to Tropical Smoothie. It'll be about a 10-minute wait.\" What?! Just to take my order? I then pull up to see if I can drive around the person in front and leave...nope. Try reversing back, a car has pulled up behind me. Now I'm trapped in their ridiculous drive-thru just waiting. Finally place my order, and the young man couldn't understand through the speaker \"no banana, sub peach on the lean machine.\" I had to repeat certain parts of my order when I got to the window to pay. This place should clean up the staff by teaching a few customer service 101 skills. They should definitely discontinue drive-thru since this is the experience they clearly offer every time. 

Food is typically good. Service just downright awful. I don't see myself returning again, but would gladly offer one more bit of advice to management here: read \"The $6,000 Egg,\" and afterwards, have your staff read it. Hopefully it'll change things around before it's too late."}
{"text":"If I could give a zero I would! I have gone here 2 different times and have waited 30 or more minutes in the drive thru just trying to give a second chance .. But both times were bad even our drinks were super watery no flavor at all! It sucks because this location is perfect!!! Like I might shed a tear on how disappointed I am. And the employees were just playing around. She took my order at the menu then told me to drive forward when I got to the window I waited 15 minutes just for her to ask what my order was because she forgot. If manager and owner of this store needs to get their shit together."}
{"text":"Love this location!! The drive-thru is so convenient and the service is always excellent . Brieanne  and Addison have amazing customer service . Brieanne was so kind and talked to me like we've been friends forever . It makes me only want to come to this location . Thanks ladies you rock!"}
{"text":"Chia Banana boost is so good. Also, the buffalo chicken wrap was amazing. Love this location and their staff is great!"}
{"text":"I had my doubts coming here because of all the reviews but guys....if you know that drive-thru takes forever then why don't you just get out of your car and go inside? Stop being lazy lol. I walked in and was greeted right away by a kind gentleman. I had my smoothie in my hand in less than a minute. 

The portion is a decent size for the price. The only reason I took off one star is because it kinda lacked in flavor. I wish it was more peanut buttery/banana-ish. Btw I got the Peanut Paradise. 

I'm new to Vegas and I found it very difficult to find a smoothie place where I could get my protein smoothie after a good workout. So I'm grateful this place even exists. I would like to come back to try the food some day."}
{"text":"Came here at 10:30 on a wednesday. Waited 20 minutes just to have my order taken. Only one guy was working. Waited another 15 minutes to get a wrap and smoothie. The owner of this place is pathetic. Hire another employee!"}
{"text":"I ordered off an app doordash and this is the location my Dasher went to pick up from. I ordered a Veggie hummus wrap and there was a paperclip in my wrap! I about choked on it! This was made by someone on shift during 1:30-2:30pm 10/22/17 and I have sent a complaint email over their corporate website. This is a hazard! I spoke to someone over the phone asking for a shift manager and was told there wasn't one available! They were unable to refund me was what the girl over the phone said and then tells me she is a supervisor!"}
{"text":"I love tropical smoothie. Their smoothies and food are delicious but omg!!! They never have anything. They always run out of something no matter what time of day you go. You can never go expecting to get what you want. They either don't have it or don't have an ingredient of the item you want. They always say sorry we ran out of this or that. It's really frustrating. Not that I'll ever stop going but hopefully whoever deals with inventory gets it together so the employees can better serve their guests. There's also such a long wait because in my experience there's only 1 employee working. The problem seems to be management and higher not employees."}
{"text":"The only convenient thing about this location is that it's open late that's it. Why there is only one person working at night is weird. They need to have two people working at night so it can be faster and people don't have to wait a long time to get their items. Also there is some weird flashing thing going on with their menu."}
{"text":"Sophia the manager is extremely rude. She treats regular customers like trash. She is very confrontational. There are always so many flys at this cafe. And the bathrooms are never clean. Please do not come here. The smoothie prices are ridiculous too. Worst experience ever."}
{"text":"Slowest tropical smoothie I have ever been to in my life. Currently in the drive thru for almost an hour, still waiting. Wouldn't have waited but was blocked in by other cars. It appears that there is only one worker doing drive thru and inside. Haven't been helped yet so can't review about anything else, but this wait time is absolutely ridiculous.

So it ended up going over an hour wait... when we finally are greeted at the window, we were told they were out of one of the sandwiches we ordered. (Couldn't have told us an hour earlier)

My kid had to use the bathroom so we ended up having to drive away. I have never had such a terrible experience with a drive thru. Will be caomg cooperate office Monday"}
{"text":"We waited in the drive-thru lane for 30 MIN & it was one car in front of us. I wanted to just drive past the window at that point & I should have just done it because he just lied to us about adding white chocolate to our drinks & they were very watery. I was so disappointed I wasted my time & money. Worst service ever"}
{"text":"Just waited 15 minutes to be even acknowledged by the girl working tonight and what's worse is that I was the only one in the store, the worst customer service I've ever encountered! Will most likely never be back!"}
{"text":"Smoothies are great but expect to wait 20-30 minutes for a smoothie. I'm waiting for my smoothie right now and there are about 20 people waiting for their orders as well. The staff is nice however, they need help. In addition, the floors are dirty and it smells like beef jerky. Because of the amount of people waiting it's rather warm inside here."}
{"text":"Well I have used the drive through here numerous times. Every time I have had to sit and wait 15-20 minutes, with the last visit nearing 25 minutes. There were only 2 cars ahead of me this last time. Yet every time I go even if one car is ahead of me I'm stuck waiting a ridiculous amount of time.    When I was a teenager I made smoothies at a juice bar it only takes a couple minutes to make .   I'm so irritated with this place.  Never again."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here and I was impressed. It was a free smoothie night, I was greeted cheerfully at the door by and enjoyed all the workers decked out in Hawaiian leis. They had the free drinks prepared and ready to hand out so there was no wait, and my nutritional questions were answered with a smile. I would definitely return for some of the yummy looking menu items."}
{"text":"Wish I could back out of drive through. It's been twenty five minuets. Door is locked at lunch time because no employees. Only drive through is open. Person behind me is honking. Had a coupon. Employee didn't give me a receipt until I asked for it. Found out Receipt did not include the coupon I gave the employee."}
{"text":"I called ahead to see what time they closed and found out the drive-thru stays open until 9pm which was a bonus.  When I arrived I ordered the Hummus Veggie Wrap and a smoothie.  The hummus wrap was unexpectedly spicy, nice surprise!  Since I couldn't decide on a smoothie, I decided to \"make my own\".  I mixed strawberry lemonade with peach & pineapple.  So good!  I loved the sandwich: chock full 'o veggies and spicy!  I wish there was a location in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Not a bad choice at all, the smoothies are good the wraps are usually pretty good if a bit basic.  I usually get a flat bread and while it's not large its a good light lunch.  

Oddly enough I rarely get a smoothie here but I've never been disappointed when I do."}
{"text":"Disappointed! Horrible service, it took forever to get 2 smoothies. The employee was very rude & careless."}
{"text":"Service here is awesome and having a fresh smoothie for breakfast is a great way to start your day.... Tropical smoothie is taking Starbucks place in my mornings...."}
{"text":"Very poor service.  Employees do not greet customers, nor do they apologize for the wait.  They constantly \"run out\" of certain fruits but then, come to find out, they have the fruit in the fridge but don't want to have to cut it up to be able to use it.  I wish they had better service as they are the only location close to my office.  I have managed retail teams before and I would be EMBARRASSED if this was my location :-("}
{"text":"Great smoothies, poor service. My friends were ordering their smoothies and The man went to go make them, but did not take my order. He didn't even acknowledge that i was there. I was trying to get his attention but it seemed as if he was deaf or ignoring me. I decided not to order because smoothies are $5 and I shouldn't have to wait. My friends and I were talking and then One of them had to go to the bathroom. She said it smelled like smoke before She went in and I want to go small bathroom and it did smell like smoke, Even though there is a no smoking sign outside of the café. Since I didn't buy  a smoothie I decided to ask for an extra cup to mix some of my friends smoothies into. The only thing I liked is that The café smoothies taste good, but according to my friends they were just too sweet. +1 star for taste, -4 for service."}
{"text":"What happened to this location?! It's dirty, smells awful & the music is cutting in and out like a horror flick. No Bueno Dina..."}
{"text":"It says it's open until 2am, but that's really only the drive thru. We're here at 10:20am and the front doors are closed. It seems a bit overpriced for smoothies and sandwiches. I got the sunrise sunset and honestly it was a super boring smoothie. My husband got the peaches and silk and it was a lot more flavorful but still not great. We each got a Sriracha flatbread as well which was ok but nothing special. Disappointing."}
{"text":"We got here at 1:14 and ordered 5 smoothies. The people I came with said that service here is epically bad, all of the time. In fact, they estimated 25 minute wait time for our smoothies. They noted a prolific bad smell in the restaurant, never more than 2 employees working at a time and all employees looking unkempt and frankly dirty. 

Today was different. We got all 5 smoothies by 1:21. What a shock. I had to dock the score to 4 stars because the drive through register cashier's shirt was in fact, filthy."}
{"text":"There is never anyone at the front when I come in. Finally when I get her attention by almost having to go behind the counter, the girl is pretty rude. I ask for suggestions and she's just like I don't know. I love that this place is so close but the customer service needs to be better."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've ever been to this location waited 10 minutes in the drive-through back out and went in And find out they only have one person working the whole store!!! 
The one customer they had inside finally got their food and told me they waited 25 minutes needless to say we left empty-handed no yummy smoothie :(
I don't recommend going here you'll  be wasting your time!!"}
{"text":"The service is extremely bad. They took over an hour to have my food ready snd it was only a wrap and a smoothie. The guy before me waited even longer for a bowl of fruit!"}
{"text":"It's very frustrating coming to this location because it takes them a ridiculous amount of time to get me food or smoothies...the employees truly do not care how long someone waits I can see them on their phone by the food trying to respond to messages before they even think about preparing a smoothie...it's strange that it is allowed in the work place. By far one of the worst locations Tropical Smoothie has. It is very very irritation waiting 25 min for a damn smoothie"}
{"text":"Could this location be any slower?? Topical Smoothie better step up their game. Too expensive for slow service. This isn't the only location with poor service but the only one I've reviewed. Doubt corporate cares though."}
{"text":"I had my hair appointment next door at 10am so as soon as I was done around 11am I decided why not grab lunch now while there is a drive thru and I have a quick few minutes to spare. I am a frequent customer of Tropical Smoothie not at this location but I always order the same thing at the Sahara/Fort Apache location and never had a problem. I ordered the Acai smoothie and a honey ham and swiss flatbread sandwich. The employee at the window wasn't very friendly. The smoothie wasn't terrible but my sandwich was surprisingly horrible! No honey, barely any ham or lettuce and the bread was cold. That is my go to sandwich that I always order because I know it's not hard to make and wow, whoever made it had no idea what they were doing as that sandwich cost me $4 and their way of making it wasn't even worth $1. I notified TSC on twitter and they offered to comp my next meal if I said my name but to me there is no point in returning to a location that would hire someone and not train them to do the job. I have not returned to the Sahara location out of no interest for TSC anymore but I hope to sometime in the future give them a second chance over this awful location."}
{"text":"I don't need to go into a big long drawn-out story but this is the worst Tropical Smoothie I've ever been to. I literally will never go here again . terrible service"}
{"text":"We saw this place from the outside and instantly wanted to try it. When we got inside, we were even more excited because the menu showcased all kinds of delicious options. Of course, there were the many smoothies but there was also the Carribean jerk wrap which looked awesome, but when we got up to the counter to order, our dreams were dashed.

There were two employees working in the back and they didn't even acknowledge us for at least 5 full minutes. 

The employee working right in front of us (the guy with the special hairdo with hair coming out of the back of his neck) was especially rude and didn't even acknowledge that he had customers standing there. 

After a while, we looked at the other customers that were sitting around the restaurant, also waiting for their food, and realized that it would be a while before we ever received service.

After we waited about 10 minutes without anyone approaching to take our order, we just walked out and decided to make a wrap at home. I have never seen service that terrible before. We are new to Nevada and that experience just soured our impression. That's it for Tropical Smoothie Cafe for us."}
{"text":"Horrible service they gave me the wrong smoothie then didn't put the lid on it and it spilled down the front of me. Manager was rude said didn't want to do anything about it"}
{"text":"Almost passed this location up. Their new logo makes it look like a generic Tropical Smoothie but I guess the entire company is rebranding.  This must be a new location because I couldn't find this one to check in on Yelp. 

I pulled up to the \"24 hour\" drive thru since I didn't want to walk the kids in.  After repeating \"Pear'ific Green Tea\" 4 times (she couldn't understand me), she asked me to pull up to the window to continue ordering. I asked if there's a menu at the window for us to look at while we are ordering. No response, so I pulled up to the window as requested. She said \"I couldn't understand you through the drive thru. What did you want to order?\"  I repeated \"Pear'ific Green Tea with no sweetener or turbenado.\"  I asked for a menu for the kids to review.  She left the window and came back with the catering menu.  I'm losing patience at this point as it's definitely more troublesome experience than if I had just walked in. She leaves the window again, so I decided to just go in to the restaurant. 

The experience inside wasn't much better. The menu is all the way up against the back wall but the ordering counter is about 20' from that wall and there's a partition in the line of sight from the ordering counter. Strange setup. The kids couldn't read the menu from the counter so they walked over to the bar where the menu is more visible (however awkwardly far from the cashier). What made it even worse was that while ordering at the counter, the cashier was ringing us in at the drive thru window. Lol. It was just such an awkward experience. Maybe it was because she was the only employee there so she had her drawer setup at the window to accommodate the drive thru?

After we finally got our smoothie orders in, I added on a spinach salad. She asked me if I wanted the small or the large. I told her the large as all 3 of us were going to share it as a side to our dinner. I asked her for the dressing on the side since we were going to accompany it with our dinner at home. She replied \"all of the toppings are in separate containers on the side.\"  Perfect!  HOWEVER, when I got home and opened my salad, the bed of spinach was under all of the containers of toppings (yes the containers are placed IN the salad), and the toppings took up about 3/4 of the box. Large salad?  This was not even close to enough for all of us to share even as a side. There was maybe about 6 oz of spinach in the box, some turkey bacon that had a weird taste (almost tasted like fish, if that makes any sense at all) and the peaches on the salad are from a can with syrup. Ick. Not even in the slight bit satisfied. What a waste of money.  I used to order salads from Tropical Smoothie all of the time. They were huge and delicious.  This was definitely not THAT...

The cashier wasn't as friendly as the staff at other locations, however she wasn't rude either. She was just there to take my order and then make it. 

We did get a good deal on our smoothies because we ordered during their \"happy hour\" so it was buy 2 get 1 free AND because it was Sunday I got a free supplement added to my smoothie. That was probably the only positive to the experience. 

Overall (and unfortunately), this location failed to deliver what I expect of this brand."}
{"text":"So dissapointed lately with this place. Tonight I ordered the chicken pesto sand which. I asked for light pesto and it was literally seeping out of the wrapper that it had so much pesto on it. There was 3 small pieces of chicken and lettuce on it. It has never came with lettuce on it? It looked like a disaster. So bummed with the quality lately."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the worst tropical smoothie locations I've ever been too. The staff doesn't greet anyone walking into the establishment, have ANY sense of urgency especially during rush hour, no one ever smiles, and the last few times I came not only have they run out of ingredients to the same smoothie every time but they never call out the order. Beyond disappointed"}
{"text":"I usually never have a problem here until today. Trust is everything especially when it comes to food service and serving. I sucked out a sticker off of my PB Apple Power Up smoothie... WTH!!! You kinda wonder what else they include while blending your smoothie?!"}
{"text":"I just love to snack in this place. Can't go wrong with the wraps anytime of the day. Depending when I want to indulge or need an extra protein after workout... Just hits the spot all the time. This place is on my way to work or even stop by after work. I always get a great service here on drive thru. Sometime I have to wait a little longer in rush hour but hell... I'll wait for anything worth the wait to satisfy my cravings."}
{"text":"It's such a shame that there customer service is awful because they really do have great smoothies. But it takes over 15 minutes every time to get a smoothie. If there's more than 2 people in front of you, it's even longer. They need more staff behind the counter!"}
{"text":"Went to Tropical Smoothie and can honestly say I won't ever be back. I was the only customer there and 5 employees working. One took my order while the other watched. The remaining three were in the back. I think it was shift a shift change as one was counting out her drawer. The two at the front continued to talk, flirt and goof around. I thought maybe I needed to go make my smoothie myself. Another customer walked in and ordered a smoothie and I thought ok, surely they will start making my drink now. NOPE!!! A third customer walked in and it wasn't until they took his order that the manager asked the girl at the front to start blending and took the boy to the back to count his drawer. My sons smoothie was fine but mine was powdery. I think they like smoking pot a little too much in that joint."}
{"text":"Serbice was awful. It took 30 minutes for them to make me one smoothie and the place was empty. The staff is young and irresponsible and the store was filthy... ugghhh"}
{"text":"I like all the coupons they're giving out for the holidays! $2.15 for a smoothie cant beat that!"}
{"text":"Drinks are good and I like how they are open 24/7. I just don't like how dirty the tables can be at times."}
{"text":"i love tropical smoothie. 
this is the only tropical smoothie that always makes my smoothie taste the way it suppose to. 
plus they always make my food nice and hot. 
tonight mariah m. helped us and she did a wonderful job. thank you!

this tropical smoothie location is 100% better then the one on boulder hwy."}
{"text":"SLOW SERVICE. 
GETS MY ORDER WRONG MORE THAN HALF THE TIME.
Good food and smoothies! I always go here for lunch as an university student. But lately they've been taking 30 MINUTES to make my food. This happened twice in a row and each time they've forgotten my cookie and I have to go back up there to ask. 
This last time it took 30 minutes and on top of that they put tomato's in my wrap which I specially asked for no tomato. I cannot eat tomatoes and I was too angry to wait another 30 minutes for them to remake it. When I tried to get a refund they couldn't because they never gave me my receipt and would have to call their manager which would take an extra 10 minutes. I said forget about it and left. 

I will not be returning to this tropical smoothie.

Food like this should NOT take 30 minutes for a wrap. Please train more staff and speed up your service! I worked at Panera for 2 years and it never took us any where near 30 minutes to make anything (unless it was for catering). I really don't understand why it took this long on two separate occasions."}
{"text":"I live less than a block from this place and STILL prefer to drive up to the one on Flamingo & 215, so that should tell you something. This place is always understaffed and so slow that it actually takes me less time to drive 10 minutes away and back."}
{"text":"We've tried this location several times. When the older people are working, it seems like the food is made correctly. But, when the younger ( teens) are working, the food is not prepared correctly. The food is pricey and I should have ALL the ingredients in my salad , wrap, sandwich. I do not want to seem age bias, but I have been in there several times & I hope the manager will do some quality control on all the employees that work there."}
{"text":"This Tropical Smoothie is the worst!! I've been waiting for 15 min to order. The staff is complaining so that the customers can hear it. Horrible service and complete disregard for the customers. The owner should look at hiring new staff. Will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I'd give negative stars if I could. On my way to work I ordered and paid on the app for a smoothie from the Rainbow & Spring Mt location. When I arrived no one was there. A Sysco delivery driver with a large food delivery for them had been waiting a half hour already. I tried to corporate number repeatedly and it was busy. I drove to the next closest location - this one. Ashley, at this location, was flippant and said there was nothing she could do. I said there must be a number they have to call in an emergency. She reluctantly gave me a number for \"Joe\" but he did not answer. I had to try to get Ashley's attention again and she called this person who did answer for her. She said she'd try to get me another number to call. I asked if she could at least honor my order (you would think offering to do so would have been the first priority in customer service) but she refused saying \"this is a franchise so we won't get our money\". Wow. I'm sure that $7.01 would break them. Clearly the opportunity to gain a new customer by treating someone right was lost on her. While waiting on her to get back to me with another number to call, I tried the corporate number again and finally got an answer. The first number Ashley gave me did return my call while I was on the phone with them but left no message. Corporate and they are refunding my purchase and sending me a \"VIP card\" - we'll see how that turns out. Ashley never did reappear so I left - 45 minutes later, with no smoothie and late for work. While this location was not the one origianlly in err, their attitude in handling the situation and recognizing that, while they may be a franchise, they are still part of a larger brand, was despicable. I am often in this area and may have been a regular customer but now I will never patronize this location."}
{"text":"I'd give negative stars if I could. On my way to work I ordered and paid via the app. When I arrived there was absolutely nobody there. There was even a Sysco delivery driver with a huge food delivery who was on able to get a hold of anybody. The corporate phone number on the website was continuously busy. I drove to the next closest location and they refused to help me or honor my order because they said it's a franchise and they won't get their money. Pretty crappy attitude over a huge $7 order."}
{"text":"The service at this location is beyond awful. It's happened so many times now, I'm finally writing a review. If there are no customers, you stand at the counter for 5+ minutes before an employee bothers to come out of the back and help you. You start thinking there literally isn't anyone there! This evening, waited at the counter 5 minutes, finally an employee slowly shuffles out from the back. Takes my order. I ordered a smoothie and a wrap with no meat. Got the smoothie in a few minutes. Another employee had appeared and was apparently working on food in the back. I waited 15 minutes for my wrap and suspected I'd better check. Sure enough, it was full of chicken! So they go to \"correct it\". Another customer comes in who placed an online order that as due to be ready 10 minutes earlier. They hadn't bothered to make her order, so she waited about 5 minutes, in the store, and they finally started it for her (15 min after it was supposed to be ready). But he was in no rush - he took the time first to change the playlist on the in-store music so he could sing along. I've now been here 30 minutes and I'm still waiting for my wrap... 

35 minutes for a smoothie & a wrap with two employees only 3 customers - total 5 smoothies, a wrap & a salad - not a grand amount of food to prepare. And the wrap I finally received was half size. I order the same thing often: Caribbean jerk wrap with no chicken, extra rice, beans, & salsa. Usually it's no problem (at better locations). What I finally got was a half size wrap with no chicken, the normal amount of rice and beans, a ton of lettuce, and a little dollop if salsa at one end of the wrap (one bite basically). Horrible, horrible service! This location should fire their lazy employees - there are plenty of people who need jobs that are actually willing to do them. If this owner has no pride in his shop, Tropical Smoothie should cancel their franchise contract."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss on how well your smoothie will taste. One time you come the same flavor you order will be good the next time it'll taste like no flavor at all. For $6.49 it isn't worth being unsatisfied for a smoothie. Not impressed and the staff is subpar, not friendly and look miserable all the time. Don't waste your money at this place that's my opinion!"}
{"text":"This has gone from best to worst in quality and customer service. It's so sad cause the owner is so nice but so hands off."}
{"text":"No starts would be my choice. Well I typically love tropical smoothie and realized it has been a few weeks since I had it. Tonight made me never want to go here again nor give my business to any of them. I walked in a little before 8pm and the cashier was counting his drawer. Not a big deal to me I understand the way business works as I used to be in f&b. He didn't look up at all and a small girl next to him said something to him. She then Looked at me but didn't say anything then continued to watch him. Three minutes later I asked if they were open still since they weren't acknowledging me and if they were closing I would easily have left so they didn't have to squeeze me in. They close at 2am so this wasn't the case. She said yea to my question of being open. Then walked away while the cashier continued to count his drawer. When he was finished about 5 minutes of me being there, he still didn't look up. No one ever said hi and greeted me, said I'm sorry it's going to be a minute, nothing. I felt so uncomfortable and irritated I left. As a business owner myself, I couldn't just let this go. I'm sorry but your two employees that were there just now shouldn't be in the hospitality business. Maybe they have other qualities but being friendly and personable isn't one. They were terrible. I won't be visiting this location again and I may never visit a tropical smoothie again. Love the product but customer service is what keeps us going to places. Advice: get a whole new staff!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to take kids. Healthy options, clean and bright environment.  ADA equipped."}
{"text":"How to run a successful smoothie establishment: First, you start with taking away promotions people like (punch card) and replace with an annoying text, promoting a product no one wants, at a time when no one is thinking about a smoothie.  Second, you staff one person at every location, so there is always a line.  (People love standing in line.)  Next, you hire people that do not eat the food to work behind the counter.  This works especially well when you release a new product and customers have questions about said product.  Finally, you raise prices...  Hey, they've taken it up to this point, why not hit them for another 50 cents on every product.  I think I'll head over to Jamba Juice and see what the lines like over there."}
{"text":"I love tropical smoothie except this location. I waited by cash register for about 5 minutes and was not greeted or told well be with you in a minute. There were 2 people working both on the blending machines for smoothies. When they finally took my order he had no emotion and did not speak to me except ask what kind of chocolate i wanted in my beach bum. Then i waited about 15 to 20 minutes just for one smoothie. There was no line just people waiting on smoothies. Sorry but you cant have a good business with just two people especially on a saturday during happy hour. At least the smoothie was good, but I will not be going back to that location ever."}
{"text":"Walked in there tonight to get 2 smoothies took the guy 25 mins to make them . Finally when I get my peanut paradise it's all water down . The guy didn't know what he was doing and seemed lost on how to make the smoothie . He had to make it again and it was still eh. Never going back there again . Not worth for the price . Terrible management as well . Should have 2 people working always ."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service and they don't ever have any Ingredients to make food. I come to tropical smoothie for the beyond meat and the guy literally had no idea they even carried it and of course they were out. I then tried to order a salad without it and they were out of the greens to make it. Why even offer food if you don't carry it. When I then asked about what was in the peanut butter cup he just said we have peanut butter cup or peanut paradise. Oh ok that's helpful. There's other locations that are better."}
{"text":"went there. only had one lady working. had to leave because she said they weren't offering food anymore because she didn't have enough time to prep being alone. have gone other times took 20 min for a smoothie. went down the street to the hualapai one. much better had 4 employees"}
{"text":"Have ordered food and smoothies several times last few times the online order does not go through I show up and the employee has no idea what I'm talking about till I show the email."}
{"text":"Before I talk about the food, let me say their menu is so confusing and they don't list half of the items they put on their wraps or sandwiches. For example, when I went in I did not see any menus besides the board behind the counter. I ordered a southwest wrap which had no description of anything that was in it. When I got it it was completely smothered in sauce.  This place is disguised as a healthy alternative but the truth is they aren't healthy at all. Their smoothies don't announce they are juice based which adds tons of sugar and the green smoothie I ordered tasted like apple juice.  I would never go here again. If this  establishment made some changes lt could be decent"}
{"text":"This location is terrible for time efficiency. Every time I come here, which is usually in the drive-thru, they take a very long time to even acknowledge you. A simple \"welcome I'll be with you in a moment\" would suffice but they leave you wondering! When they finally do take your order and have you pull up to the window, they take even longer to come to the window to take your payment and give you your food. It's as if they have only 1 member in staff during lunch hour. Unacceptable. The food at the very least comes out tasting great, so this is the only reason I continue to come to this location. That and I love the food here but this is the only location closest to me."}
{"text":"I should have walked out as soon as I walked in due to the bad smell, terrible customer service. Everyone working there were pissed to be there. They got my order wrong. I was smiling and trying to be friendly through the process but there was nothing I could do to up the atmosphere. I feel bad for people working there. There was just one girl taking orders and making everything no wonder she couldn't do better. Understaffing and lack of training."}
{"text":"We were on our way to eat somewhere else when I saw the Tropical Smoothie sign. We love Tropical Smoothie, so we happily made a u-turn & came back. Its truly a shame I didn't check the reviews beforehand. I could have saved my taste buds from disappointment.  

The young lady that helped us was very nice, but I wonder if she would have eaten what she made. My husband ordered a buffalo chicken wrap and it was unbelievable dry. We had to ask for buffalo sauce on the side. I ordered half a sandwich and a smoothie. The bread on the sandwich was burnt and my smoothie was thick and chunky. I had them remake the sandwich but I took the smoothie home and ran it through my Vitamix. Sorry to say this location will not get a returned visit."}
{"text":"This location really needs to get it together! Every time I come in here it's something! Last time the credit card system crashes and they couldn't get it reset! This time, they don't have the ability to use the TS app! Update ur systems!!!! Staff is nice. At least that's a plus!!! That's the only reason u get three stars. Good job staff!"}
{"text":"I received a text this morning saying buy any item and get a free smoothie of equal or lesser value. I get to the store and the line is literally almost out of the door. But I wait anyway. After waiting in line for 20+ minutes, I finally get to the front and she asks me to wait. She goes in the back and complains about how unprepared they are. I try to politely have a conversation with her and she is short and rude. When I finally get a chance to order, they are out of my first choice, tacos. So instead, I want to order the flatbread. It's .20 less than the smoothie and I ask if she will give me the flatbread free. Instead, she rudely reminds me of what the text message said. I understand what it says. I understand that there are polices and rules, but you would think after such a long wait AND being out of what I wanted, she could compensate. Terrible customer service. I went to lunch somewhere else and I will STRONGLY consider driving all the way up to horizon and 95 next time I have a smoothie craving."}
{"text":"The first and only time I attempted to try this place, we placed our order then when it came time to pay, we were told that their card machine was broken and that they were only accepting cash. We did not have cash so we cancelled the order and left empty handed. 

If the business can't afford a decent machine that doesn't break, then I don't want to eat there. I also think it was poor on their part for not informing us that it was  \"cash only\" soon as we came in. Nope, they let us waste time looking at the menu and ordering before telling us. 

We were on a time crunch too because we were watching football at the nearby bar. We were trying to order during halftime. So double negative in my opinion. 

Food may or may not be good. I dunno because I didn't try it. Because of this experience, I'm not interested in going back. 

Meh... No bueno."}
{"text":"Owner do something about your Store. Terrible manners. Employees don't smile or say hello. If you hate your job that much go work somewhere else. All these reviews saying the same thing has to bring up a red flag. Girl working to night was ok, but overall when I come here it's a  super negative vibe."}
{"text":"Took 20 minutes for a smoothie and a wrap. Even took 5 minutes just to get my order taken. Late to work. Had plenty of time to spare before walking in for a \"quick\" grab and go."}
{"text":"I am absolutely delighted that we finally have a smoothie place in Monroe. I have been a Jamba Juice addict for almost 20 years, and greatly missed having my regular smoothies when I relocated here.

Tropical Smoothie Cafe opened about a month ago, and I have had a smoothie there at least three times a week since. I've also had a few of their wraps, and while I'm not a big fan of meet, I can recommend several of their chicken wraps as being quite tasty, healthy, and filling. 

I have had the avocolada, orange glow (?) And the Paradise Point. I found all three of them to be very tasty and what order any one of them again. I have also tried their seasonal special with cactus juice and liked it. I would say that if you don't like things that taste green, don't order this one because there is a very green taste to it.

Unless something drastically changes, I will be returning here on a regular basis to enjoy my smoothie addiction!"}
{"text":"I can see why the reviews are so low for this location. I ordered a chipotle chicken club flatbread today. I paid at 2:55, walked next door to Sambalatte, ordered an iced latte, received my drink, updated some apps, went and washed my hands...surely my simple flatbread was ready by now. 

Upon returning, no flatbread in sight. I stood there waiting for several minutes only to see the lady that was behind me receive her sandwich. A couple minutes later the young girl who was behind her received her flatbread. I inquired about my flatbread and was assured mine was next. At 3:16 I received my flatbread, sadly the chicken was barely lukewarm and that's probably generous. 

If you ask me, 21 min for a fast food flatbread is way too long to wait especially mid afternoon when businesses are usually barely occupied with guests. If they're going to take that long, at least make it good!"}
{"text":"I think this is my first time I'm actually giving a 1 star in my review and they don't even deserve it. This place is filthy! The girl behind the register, ohhh to tell you I was afraid to drink my smoothie for the fact that I have to watch her make a drink, not wash her hands, and her HAIR is all over the place! Her hair is not even in a bun or a hair net at least and did I mention her hair is thick!!! It took them 5 minutes to say hi or acknowledge the fact that we are staring at them waiting. I WILL NOT COME HERE AGAIN!!!"}
{"text":"This place is bad. Went 2 days in a row and the first time we went the guy told us that food isn't made after 12 AM but (surprisingly) he could make ours. Our smoothies had no whey protein in them even though he ASKED what kind of protein we wanted. I didn't want to give him a hard time so I said it was fine, we would try again next time. He seemed like he was whatever about everything and when we asked for opinions about things he would just be negative and say he didn't like it. The meat in the sandwiches seemed like it wasn't even packaged because the edges were dry. The next day we went again, different staff and very bad at basic customer service. No greet and no smile. The smoothies finally tasted like they had whey protein in them but the food we took home was wrong. I had ordered lays baked chips and we noticed they were not even in the bag even though he asked what kind of chips we wanted. I told him and he still goes to grab the wrong bag of chips. I ordered a nice easy simple turkey wrap and for crying out loud they give me a Jamaican wrap. I can't even begin with these people! Tropical Smoothie has so much potential but the shitty employees make me never want to go back! Or at least not to this one!!"}
{"text":"Legit smoothie place. I prefer Jamba Juice but this place fits the bill when I'm in need of something healthy to drink near my job. The prices are slightly higher than Jamba too. Make sure to check the back table before ordering, they often have coupons sitting there waiting to be claimed. The service is okay. They have a limited food menu but I've never tried any food because nothing seems appealing."}
{"text":"The reason I gave Tropical Smoothie Cafe three stars is for their noodle bowls. The smoothies are awesome-- hence the three stars. I will return again and again for the smoothies alone.
However, the noodle bowls they offer are awful and deserve one star. 
The bowls seem to be prepackaged, put together at the location and then microwaved. The bowls have almost no flavor and the portion size is very small. 
For $6, I would expect something a little better. I can get the same thing from WalMart or Costco for much less than $6."}
{"text":"I walked in and was the only customer in the store (early morning). No one was near the front area. As an employee walked towards the register, I did not receive any greeting or \"what would you like to order?\". As she just stared at me, I told her what I wanted.  After I had paid for it, she hands me my card without saying anything.  I would assume her response should have been \"Thank you, you're order will be up shortly\".  As my order was being made by another person, the female that helped me out at the registered went to go chat it up with her co-worker as she slouched on the wall not wanting to do anything.  This review is based on their customer service.  I really like the smoothies at TSC but I have not experienced this type of service at any of the other locations.

(This was during a visit sometime in early October)"}
{"text":"So extremely happy that there is a tropical smoothie in this area. Supposedly there used to be one here and it closed down, and NOW it has re-opened. They serve delicious fresh smoothies. [beware that each smoothie has a cup of \"turbinado\" in it- which is raw sugar]. They also have really good fresh food here. The wraps and the flat breads are good and decently priced. 

I like the fact that you can order the smoothies made with splenda -atleast they have that option. I also like how they are comin up with more healthy smoothies. (ie: I got the spinach and kale smoothie yesterday) 

They are also opened really early, (drive-thru open at 6AM) so I can stop in before I head to work. Ive always been a fan of TS, just glad that there is another location out here."}
{"text":"This is one of the worst overall businesses I have ever gone to. I have only myself to blame because after the umpteenth time of being utterly saddened and disappointed either because I sat in line for 10 straight minutes while the cashier stared through my soul like I was Patrick Swayze in ghost, or I didn't get what I ordered because the worker has less self respect than a suicidal masochist with deep depression so why would they give a rats ass about getting an order right, or being talked to like I just raped the manager's mother. There are many other reasons. I myself might be a masochist because why else would I keep coming back to this hole other than to be let down. I have made a pact with Jesus Christ almighty, I will never be returning to this place ever again. Shall I make that mistake I will put my pistol in my own mouth and end my own misery. If I could, I would score it a -infinity star rating."}
{"text":"They make killer smoothies here! With protein added it comes to about $6 which isn't bad considering the size of the drink. Other places have much smaller sizes for the same price. Their sandwiches are solid too and really inexpensive. It's never too busy either so you know you're not gonna wait long for your food!"}
{"text":"This Tropical Smoothie overall just has been bad. Doesn't matter what time of day it is. You'd think it'd be convenient since it's next to the EoS gym. The last 2-3 times I've gone they've either messed up our orders, had to actually call the place itself to get service in the drive-thru, or have been told they aren't making food. My girlfriend even went last night and was told \"We're out of food, we're not out, just not making any.\" Only time I can recall where it was okay was when the person making our food asked us to try our drinks if they were okay because he felt that he might've forgotten some ingredients. Tasted funny, so he took them back and made us a new batch. 

Just do yourself a favor, drive a little further to the Tropical Smoothie on Farm and Durango."}
{"text":"I'm not really one to write bad reviews, but it was REALLY BAD. The service was unfriendly and slow, but beyond that, the place was FILTHY. I don't think this location has been cleaned EVER. I almost didn't eat my food because I thought if the customer facing area of this restaurant was so gross, I can't imagine what the kitchen looked like. The restroom had no seat covers, no toilet paper, no soap, no towels. The floor was sticky and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months. It was disgusting. Nothing was stocked, no forks, straws, napkins. Lots of people standing around waiting. This is super close to my work, but I will NEVER be back to this location again. Gross gross gross."}
{"text":"My go-to place when in college. Bahama Mama has always been a favorite."}
{"text":"Nice and helpful staff! Clean interior and great food. Highly recommend the flatbread wraps!!"}
{"text":"I got turned on to Tropical Smoothie when I got a coupon for a free one.  They are delicious and refreshing.  I've been there a few times and will be back again."}
{"text":"Waited 10 minutes in drive thru and no one took my order. Backed out and went to the parking lot. Employees busily working, but not for the drive thru or inside customers. No one even acknowledged the four of us standing in line. Ended up leaving and going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Worst drive thru ever sat and still didn't order for about 30 minutes!! What kind of excuse can they give for that. Didn't end up buying anything"}
{"text":"Great tasting smoothies friendly customer service and they are pretty good with not messing up orders. They messed mine up one time but if your looking for a good sized great tasting smoothie this place is at the top of my list."}
{"text":"They need help always moving super fast at lunch time. Nice people and good food and smoothies. Get them some help!!"}
{"text":"Love that it's open 24/7! Smoothies are pretty good. Expected a better sand which though. Over all, people were nice and it's great for after the gym."}
{"text":"Detox Island Green or regular Island Green are awesome!  I get it without the added sugar (which is all natural), I just don't need it - the fruit is sweet enough for me.  Always friendly and fast in the mornings!  I order and go to Starbucks while I wait and keep the drink in the fridge and have it for lunch :)"}
{"text":"Stood there for 10 mins as they continued to do nothing. Just as another customer walked in they took his order and we still stood there patently waiting. Keep in mind, we are very contributing to our community and have done many things to help this business prosper. They rushed me to get a smoothie after they told me they didnt have the one I wanted (which is at every location). I am sad. I am disappointed. I think of my mother, I cry."}
{"text":"This is why zero stars should be an option. I don't have high expectations whenever I come to tropical smoothie, but this was below that. 
Walked in got in line. Cashier took the order of the few people in front of me. Then just went to the back without making eye contact or saying anything. It looked as if she was helping the others in kitchen catch up which is fine. I get that. 
Every time a worker brought out an order they didn't acknowledge me or anyone in line. 
Literally 15 went by... not once a sorry, I'll be right with you. The couple behind us left as the line continued to grow. The only reason we didn't leave is because my son just got braces on and it hurt to chew. After finally being helped still no apology. Just a nonchalant attitude.  Too bad their customer service is so terrible at most tropical smoothies because the smoothies are pretty decent."}
{"text":"I have been coming here often for the past month and so far I've gotten mixed feelings. The smoothies come out tasting great however the atmosphere is not very welcoming. 

I've noticed the female staff are much more friendly and seem genuinely happy for your service than the men (or more specifically, one constantly in particular, but I can't remember his name). I also work in the retail/food-handling business and there's no way that the unwelcoming behavior I've experienced would be allowed. Learn to smile and interact with people. No one wants to feel out-of-place when they are coming to support and pay towards a business. 

Also, since when have they been giving out punch cards?! I could have received a free smoothie by now. No staff members have offered any, especially now that they recognize me by face. There's always a time to promote deals/specials people!

I will be returning due to proximity, however, I hope to see a change in staff behavior and more of an effort in offering special services."}
{"text":"UPDATE: I tried calling the store phone number for this location, and it has been disconnected.  Apparently this store has NO MANAGEMENT and an owner that is not present in the business. It definitely shows!  A LOT of red flags here!  I also called Tropical Smoothie corporate with no luck. There isn't any option to speak to a person..you can only leave a voicemail and hopefully for a return call. And hopefully I can catch the call if it's returned.  

5/7/2018: Service and food quality have completely gone downhill to the point where I'm surprised this location is still open. The drive thru sign has been broken for months now.  Food is always undercooked and soggy. Wow...used to be one of my favorite places to stop for a quick, healthy, and fresh bite.  My food was soggy, and I was given the wrong smoothie."}
{"text":"Every. Single. Time. I have come to this location, it's at least a 20 minute wait in the drive through. Rude service. Never answers their phones. No matter if I come super early in the morning or for lunch, always ridiculous amount of time waiting. One star for the food being good. Zero stars for efficiency or customer service."}
{"text":"For a 24 hr place, I'd like to think they'd be ready for customers at all hours of the night. 3 of us got off work and went over there at 3:30am. We couldn't tell if they were actually open because it was dark, the place looked absolutely trashed and we didn't see a single movement inside. If it weren't for the giant banner that said 24 hrs, we wouldn't have known they were open at all.  We see a guy emerge from the kitchen because I assume he saw our cars pull up, so we go inside. We order, pay, etc. I ordered a Coke with my wrap, but they didn't have fountains, just bottles. The only bottles I saw were in a tub of what used to be ice hours ago next to the register. I was not aware I was supposed to grab one of the room temperature Cokes that have been sitting there since who knows when and the cashier didn't seem interested in either getting a fresh one or offering a cup of ice. You know what, this is going to take all night, so I'll just break it down:

- 2 wraps and a salad took 20 min for the wraps and another 10 min for the salad to come out.
- 1 of the wraps was Thai chicken, and there wasn't a single piece of chicken on it. Not like it lacked a decent amount, the literal chicken part was missing.
- When told about the missing chicken, the worker who's name I can't recall but weighed about 60 lbs said, quote, \"Oh, yeaaah. I knew I forgot that part.\" He knew and apparently thought no one would notice. The pregnant woman noticed and was not pleased.
- I can't tell how many interactions we had with the worker after that, but we did watch him change his gloves maybe twice, in between touching the doors to deliver food, constantly pulling his pants up, making other orders for the other people that came in, etc. 
- When my friend with the salad became extremely skeptical about the cleanliness of her food after not touching it because of the glove thing, she asked for a refund and while the worker offered a refund with no problem, he complained that he wasn't even supposed to be there. Cool story, bro. Doesn't mean you get to act careless when it comes to basic health code stuff.

Salad friend swears the service and everything else is way better midday, but if you're going to be a 24 hr place, it should be consistent. Never again. I'll wait for Jamba Juice to open at 7 from here on out."}
{"text":"I don't know if anyone else has noticed, but I feel like EVERY tropical smoothie here in Las Vegas is extremely slow. There was 6 cars in front of me and I waited 55 minutes (my whole lunch break) to finally get to the window. My longest that I've waited in a tropical smoothie drive thru was 50 minutes on the north side, so I beat my record today. Yay me. I usually go to tropical smoothie late at night and it's pretty quick, but they really need to do something with the short staff during lunch hours. Other than that, I still love my peanut butter cup."}
{"text":"They have worked out most of the kinks since opening. The food is great like always, service is definitely improved. Sometimes the steak is a little tough other than that you cant go wrong."}
{"text":"The purpose of a franchise is to have a process already established and the individual working just has to follow those directions. When your employees do not follow directions you end up getting less than stellar food and the consistency between Tropical Smoothies is not there. Recommend you teaching your employees the proper measurements for smoothies."}
{"text":"Love that it's by the gym. I go late because I work graveyards and I've never had a problem. Chipotle chicken wrap is amazing and I love the size of the smoothies. If I'm too lazy to make a protein shake or just not going home right away, I always go here and they have lots of protein options! \"Customer service is on and off. Sometimes it's great sometimes it's lacking but it's never terrible."}
{"text":"Came here for the millionth time and had a different worker than the guy who's usually here. I get the same smoothie every time, peanut butter cup. This one tastes like water. Not over exaggerating, it's terrible. Idk why there isn't consistency but it's so watered down it tastes like watered chocolate with bananas."}
{"text":"Waited 30 mins for a flatbread.. The customer after me took mine but doesn't matter because it shouldn't have taken long since there wasn't a lot of customers.. The smoothie tasted different than the previous times I've had them too. Got chips for the wait but it still wasn't a pleasant experience. Will stick to Jamba.."}
{"text":"I've liked everything that I've gotten from here so far. My favorite smoothie is their new açaí berry smoothie and I add B12 and probiotics. It's really good. 
The peanut butter and banana flatbread is awesome for a snack and I've also tried a turkey sandwich they have on the menu. Their chipotle mayo is delicious. I like this place because it's a refreshing 24/7 choice instead of a regular fast food chai"}
{"text":"Fresh, yummy smoothies for a good price! I tried the chia banana boost smoothie since I love peanut butter and banana and I am dairy-free due to lactose intolerance. The combination of cinnamon, chia seeds, banana and peanut butter was delicious! They make them fresh and the service was excellent. I think I have found my new treat for the summer. Parking is easy with the lots and they also have a food menu, which I haven't tried yet. It's location is near Party City in the Carmel rd shopping center. The price is fair compared to local smoothies $5.89 and it's large enough to split."}
{"text":"Love love love the grain bowls this what I come here for. The apple kale slaw is good too. I haven't tried any of the other foods. Only negative is I feel like all the girls that work there have attitudes, and look like they hate their job."}
{"text":"Placed an online order at 10:36 AM with an 11 AM pickup time. I arrive at the location @ 11:02 and my order was not ready nor even made. I didn't receive my smoothie or wrap until 11:10. What is the point in ordering online, choosing a pick up time, paying for your order right then and there, only to walk in and your order isn't ready. Then having to wait in line with everyone that came into the location well AFTER your order was placed and already paid for. I wasted a good portion of my lunch break waiting around for them when it should have already been ready when I walked through the door."}
{"text":"Time to bump up the reviews here for this location. A warm smile goes a LONG way. Felicea made this a positive experience here. Not only did she give a great smile; she was super fast on making my smoothie. She did this so well that I wasn't even ready when I look up and hear, \"Here you go.\"  This matters when seeking quality service. I hope the manager of this location reads these reviews and acknowledges this because Felicea needs to be praised for her solid quality contribution. The smoothies made are made the same in any TSC location. This review is strictly on how well someone treated their guests. Thank you, Felicea. Great work!"}
{"text":"I purchase tropical smoothie quite often at other locations and have nothing but great service however this location I could not say the same thing about. I now work nearby and have been here 3 times in the last week. The first morning was around 10:30am pulled right up to the drive thru and wasn't acknowledged or asked for my order for 14 minutes!!! Then to wait just another 5 minutes at the window before receiving my drink. Quite ridiculous considering there was no one in front of me. Talk about a ridiculous amount of time to spend in a drive thru line with no other cars. The second time I gave the indoor service a change. Yet again I stood waiting to order for over 5 minutes then waited about 10 just to get my smoothie and it was not busy whatsoever. Then today to top it off I stood at the register ready to order for exactly 11 minutes ! (Yes I did time it to see if they would get to me in a timely manner) Not only was I waiting to order I was never acknowledged. With 4 people working behind the counter its quite sad not one person could even tell me they would be right with me. I know at the other locations not only do they get to you in a decent amount of time (3-5 minutes seems to be reasonable) they greet you upon entering. This location just doesn't seem to be up to the standards the other ones seem to hold. Not to mention over 3/4 of their food choices say \"temporarily sold out\" therefore there are very few items to choose from meal wise. Visiting this location has been incredibly upsetting not only the poor service just the demeanor of the employees overall. I hope someone has a look into this very soon."}
{"text":"I bought a groupon for here when a few gfs and I were going to meet for lunch. I'm glad I had it because I don't find it worth paying full price for what they offer or for their customer service. 

I got a Caesar wrap, a sunrise smoothie and a kids pizza meal with an extra kid smoothie. The girl behind the counter couldn't answer any of my questions when it came to the smoothies, I asked a simple question too like what's the different in supercharged ones vs indulgent she just said I don't know. Okay thanks super helpful. Then they forgot the extra kids smoothie and when I asked about it she said hold on yet no one ever brought it out and after my meal asked to be refunded. 

I'll only go back to use my last two vouchers and will probably only get smoothies and avoid the food. I did notice they had a good happy hour deal on smoothies so if I did visit again without a groupon would probably be during that special."}
{"text":"I placed an order for delivery at 3:45. I was told there was one order ahead of mine so I figure 45 minutes to an hour max. 5:30 and the delivery driver calls me to tell me he's on his way to me because the previous orser was in Easy Henderson. At this point I've already called twice and I'm pretty irritated. I get my order over two hours after I ordered it. So I have to wait a ridiculous amount of time to get my food because they can't make their range smaller? Never ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I'm trying so hard to write this review without using curse words and profanity. To sum it all up, this place and location sucks!!!!

The lady who took my order was very rude and short. Before she even took my order she was on the phone in the back and didn't even acknowledge me until about after 6 minutes of waiting at the register. I was asking what all came in a honey ham & swiss wrap and she pointed and said \"everything in the picture!\" That was the rudest service I've ever experienced.

So I just went ahead and ordered the flatbread sandwich, a banana, and a 24oz mango smoothie. The flatbread sandwich was dripping with some kind of weird honey dressing and she only gave me one napkin that was already soaked from the sauce leaking. The banana was beat up and bruised and the smoothie was the thickest drink I've ever had. Literally brick hard! There was no way to possibly consume this smoothie through a straw so I was forced to eat it with a spoon.

Overall, DO NOT EVER EVER EVER visit this location unless you want to or have $10 to throw away on a lunch break. I am upset at myself for that. Tropical Smoothie will never get my money again!"}
{"text":"Mediocre service at this one. No one said hello, quite a wait to take our order. Very few other people here. 

Couldn't understand the name of the person after us, Javier, not uncommon and only one spelling, then couldn't spell it. Every person going up to order has made a joke about how long they waited. 

Buffalo chicken wrap tasted fine, but chicken on only one end."}
{"text":"The Chocolate Chiller smoothie is bomb.com! I love when they have their happy hour, where you buy one, get one free!"}
{"text":"I've never been around employees so stupid and incompetent in my life. My first time there and the employee decided he was going to lick his fingers and slick back his hair while he was making my sandwhich without gloves... I walked out. I admit, I went back a second time thinking it was a one time deal. The second time the employees were complaining our oder was too big... it was two sandwiches and two smoothies. When we checked our order, it was all wrong and only half made. This place is a joke and their employees are the punch line."}
{"text":"This is by far the best tropical I have been to in a while. I am a tropical smoothie fanatic. My sister and I have been on a search to find a trop that makes the cranberry truffle smoothie the right way. Tonight, I finally found a tropical that I am satisfied with. The service was great, and quick. (24 hour drive thru is super convenient) My smoothie was made exactly how it ought to be, and the gentlemen even made us a discontinued flatbread that most places won't make. I am very happy with this location, and will be visiting it every time I am craving tropical!"}
{"text":"30 minutes for lunch...jump in the car and head to Tropical Smoothie Cafe
24 minutes left...Arrive at TSC and open the door - ARGH a line!
22 minutes left...wow, that line moved fast, I'm ordering!
20 minutes left...waiting with several other folks for our smoothie/wraps/etc...
18 minutes left...Got my wrap...smoothie folks still scoopin and churnin...
17 minutes left...Got my smoothie and grab a table
15 minutes left...BRAIN FREEZE - ok, slow down, eat some wrap, close eyes and wince
12 minutes left...that wrap was scrumptious (I know, who uses that word right?)
10 minutes left...back in the car, still half a smoothie left to sip
4 minutes left...walking back into work, plenty of time, still sippin my smoothie

Gotta say, this place has very tasty and healthy treats, they are faster than you expect, and the service is great and efficient. They've got a loyalty card, so your tenth item is free."}
{"text":"Same as all the other reviewers here:
1. Never more than two people working, mostly only one person doing EVERYTHING.
2. No online ordering.
3. Payment systems always down.
4. They must use GOOGLE PHONE or something to save $50/mo on an actual phone.
5. Frequently out of peanut butter, which I grew up on IN THE GHETTO. Can't afford peanut butter? Close this place. 
It's a buck fifty cheaper for a smoothie a mile east down Cheyenne at the next location: the one with people, a phone, and peanut butter."}
{"text":"It's not very clean in the dining area and they gave my smoothie to someone else so I had to wait longer than necessary. It seems they need to work on improving work flow or getting another employee in there to help out."}
{"text":"Tropical smoothie is one of my go-to lunch options. Fast friendly service and I never feel bogged down by the food. 

Kiwi Quencher is my favorite smoothie that they offer."}
{"text":"Stopped in after climbing Lone Mountain for a smoothie.  The drive-thru is 24/7 which is nice given the hour of the morning.  The order at the talk box was taken in quick fashion and with a friendly tone.  My smoothie upon delivery was made to order and with smiles.  Nice to know it is in the area (and open all the time), I know I will be back."}
{"text":"As far as Tropical Smoothie Cafes go, this one is good to go.

Nice and clean and the staff is always very friendly.

Don't forget your punch card! 10th one is free."}
{"text":"Smoothies are great and cheap. Very convenient that they're open 24 hours... Down side is the customer service. Seems like it's an inconvenience that we're coming in and bringing business to this establishment. Idk maybe its time to hire new workers?"}
{"text":"I almost choked on a bone in my Chicken Caesar Wrap and the workers were not very concerned. They just said, \"Oh, so sorry.\"  And went on with their orders. I love Tropical Smoothie but if it's this dangerous and uncaring then I will have to put up with Jamba Juice next time. Eat at your own risk!!!"}
{"text":"Food and smoothies are awesome! They need more staff! The girl working is helpful and nice but clearly overworked!! They need someone on food someone on smoothies and someone working the register!"}
{"text":"As the recent reviews have stated it really is a hit or miss. I have noticed a trend since I have been a frequent visitor -- the service is great during the day but as soon as the evening hits I advise you to enter at your own risk. The place closes it's door around 7, but the drive thru remains open 24/7. Try visiting the place when you can still walk in, that way you know what kind of service you will be getting here. Other than that, the prices are fair."}
{"text":"I generally like this chain. Their smoothies as pretty good and semi-healthy. But this location isn't worth setting foot in- by far the worst service I've ever experienced. 

The first time I stopped by, the young lady working was standing outside chatting with her boyfriend for over five minutes before coming inside to 1) ignore me and 2) proceed to screw around in the kitchen for another five minutes before acknowledging my existence and rudely taking my order. What?! Awful!!

I have returned a couple times since then, for convenience sake, and each time the service has been horrendous- it seems that every person they've hired shares the same sullen, rude attitude. It's a shame- despite my love of smoothies, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"You thought the DMV was bad...wait till you experience this Tropical Smoothie Cafe. Epic."}
{"text":"This is one of my Fav spot , but service & quality has gone down . It's Sunday lunch time n only 2 working . I feel bad for the 2 girls working there butts off. Drive thru busy and front counter .there 4 people ahead of and 6 cars on drive thru. The girls were very nice  n very apologetic. Manager should be working when under staff . Had 2 Jam jerk/s2 smoothies w/chips  and was Not as good ..."}
{"text":"The location is far enough outside of the busy chain of restaurants. Clean and open atmosphere. The food is fresh. Great variety of sandwiches, salads and smoothies. I had the chicken pesto with kala salad. Great-tasting favors. Easy parking. Fast service. Good music. Friendly. I've only been here once, but plan to come back and try more off the menu."}
{"text":"Stopped in here today to grab a smoothie and buffalo chicken wraps for my son and I. I asked for no tomatoes and extra chicken on one wrap (btw extra chicken is $2 more). A little more than $24 yikes! Got my smoothie and wraps about 10 minutes and left. Less than a 20 minutes later, my son and I open up our wraps only to find that the wrap I specifically ordered no tomatoes and extra chicken in had tomatoes galore and no extra chicken. My son ended up having to throw most of it out because he didn't like the taste of it."}
{"text":"Love this place! And I absolutely love that they have a drive thru! My only peeve with this place is the employees. The ones I've encountered aren't so friendly.. But I love the smoothies!"}
{"text":"The sandwich was so good (cranberry chicken salad)! The smoothie was really amazing too, although I'm not sure which one I had. 

When I went in I was getting a cold, so asked for the most antioxidant packed smoothie, and the person checking me out didn't know what that meant. I told him to please just give me the most popular. Lol. It's okay though, I don't expect him to be certified in health everything. 

My 4 star review is because they double charged my card by accident. To fix it I have to go back in, which is kind of annoying since I don't live on that side of town. 

Otherwise, I definitely suggest this location! The service is fast, and the food is good. :)"}
{"text":"This is a nice place to go when you're waiting around for class to start across the street, or you got out of class early. I went here frequently toward the end of the Spring semester as it got warmer.

The food and smoothies are good, but sometimes a smoothie feels like a meal. I'd much rather go here than Starbucks. It's healthier and I don't go away feeling like I need a nap."}
{"text":"Staff is always friendly when I come in. I didn't realize the flatbread don't come with chips and they offered me some for free. I declined but the offer was nice"}
{"text":"Every time I come here it takes them FOREVERRRRRRRRRRR to make a smoothie... There were 4 cars ahead of me and I've been waiting for 20+ min!! Their smoothies are okay tasting too, I usually get the muscle blaster with oats."}
{"text":"This is the second time coming. Regardless my past experience. I'm giving them three stars, why? They only have one employee working, taking orders and trying to maintain  this location. This poor kid is trying his best, he was polite and apologized for the wait. I blame management for the low ratings. How can you have one employee working during the busiest time."}
{"text":"Friendly customer service this morning and after being an idiot and driving off with my smoothie on the roof of my car because I forgot it and was buckling my little one in her car seat, I came back and the associate remade me another one. Much appreciated!"}
{"text":"This place smells horrible and the fruit bar doesn't look like they clean it.  Left and went to Jamba Juice only a couple blocks away."}
{"text":"My gosh why is this poor girl working alone here? Non stop customers! She is running around like crazy- the poor thing!! She is doing an amazing job, food is great- but PLEASE get her some help!"}
{"text":"I'm upset about that hat I discovered today . I usually don't go in and order online pick up through the drive thru. I walked into them making my flatbread and they stuck it in the microwave. Now they are suppose to be a healthier choice . If I wanted microwaved food , I would make it myself ! Microwaves kill any nutrition in the food ! So I'm now about to eat nothing but a filler . Tropical smoothie owners really need to throw the microwave away and use the oven! It's gross and disgusting!"}
{"text":"I really like the chicken salad sandwich here and some of their smoothies.  I normally come here for their half sandwich and smoothy special which is about $8.

The problem is the service.  I came in and waited for about 10 minutes and there was no one to be found.  There was no bell or anyway of announcing my presence.  Finally I had to make noise and then this girl with no personality came out and asked how long I had been waiting, I told her and she was like ok I need to figure out what is wrong with the door because it has a sensor that should let me know when someone opens the door.   I really don't care about the technical difficulties you are having when I didn't even get an apology.  That may have made a difference.  But really, what is she doing here by herself anyway. 

My sandwich on this occasion was still good but the smoothie was soupy.  

I presented the girl with my stamp card and she stated they don't accept or stamp cards anymore, okay.... When did this happen, and is there a replacement rewards card??? No biggy but again the poor service just continued. 

Not sure if this was an isolated occasion, however I don't think I'll be returning to this location."}
{"text":"They recently renovated this location and it looks great, it definitely need it! But service remains inconsistent. They are not very timely, lines are long. Sometimes id wish id gone to Red Rock food court instead. Ive also had unfortunate mishaps at this location."}
{"text":"Why would you have just one person working and the fact that he's new? I understand he was working alone so I was going to tip him a dollar he's a nerdy white guy with long curly messy hair and glasses. Served a woman in front of me and he just threw her stuff no smile no nothing just threw her things down and moved on to me. I was a bit thrown off so I asked him to make a bowl for me and he made an excuse of \"they didn't teach me how to do that\" like you can't try? \"No sorry\" I'm like uh okay? Well just two smoothies chia boost and Acai berry boost. Didn't fill the cup properly and my chia boost didn't have all the ingredients in it. I watched him make both. Shitty."}
{"text":"Very slow and rude service. Waited for 10min before being helped, the drive through took preference before the line of 5 in the store. When the employee went to help me she was very rude and unfriendly. She didn't even greet me but rather just stared at me as a means to make me order. As she went to help the next customer she totally switched her attitude and tried to flirt with him. Won't be back to this location."}
{"text":"I hate to write a poor review considering I like the Tropical Smoothie Cafe chain. Unfortunately, my visit at this location on May 30, 2018 consisted of a soggy buffalo chicken wrap and a watered down smoothie. First off, I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap and when I got my order it look like it was just dripping in water--you could literally pick it up and juice from the lettuce mixed with tomatoes and hot sauce would fall out. However, I was hungry and so I proceeded to eat what I had a paid for. Side note: I should've taken a photo, I regret not doing so, but for $8 for the wrap this was horrible. So, I moved on to my peanut paradise smoothie considering  the wrap was drenched in hot sauce. Didn't get better from there. The smoothie was bland. How does a smoothie taste bland? You mix your ingredients in a blender and press the button. Apparently, it's possible and mine tasted like they put too much ice, peanut butter, and topped it with water. 

That was two days ago. Here we are today and it seems that I'm still paying for that damn buffalo chicken wrap. I hate to play the blame game, but that wrap made me sick. It was the only thing I could think of to make me sick with diarrhea for over 24 hours now. It was poorly made and you can tell that a wrap as ugly as that could make a person sick. To conclude, I'll avoid that Tropical Smoothie Cafe. I shall stick with Jamba Juice as they are actually consistent with their menu."}
{"text":"My fiance just picked up a king caesar wrap with a kiwi quencher around 11 pm. My wrap was rolled in a regular wrap that tasted like a flour tortilla, not a garlic herb tortilla. Also, the wrap was almost completely flat, it had very little substance other than the smear of caesar dressing. 

The wrap was rolled in a small, white, thin sheet. Not even in their traditional logo sheet.

I wouldn't have even eaten it if I wasn't starving. I only picked at it.

On top of that, the worker wouldn't accept my tropical smoothie rewards so I may get the credit for this purchase."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My husband and I always go here when we want a good smoothie! We always get the paradise point! We have always had a good experience with the workers. They have been professional and kind! We will definitely continue coming here!"}
{"text":"Employees were very rude. Having loud conversations about being hungover. I was scared to consume my food."}
{"text":"When we arrived there were two people waiting in line to order. When it was our turn to order, the cashier picked up the phone and sounded excited (very loudly) and turned her back to us. Eventually, after about a couple of minutes someone in the back yelled \"you have a line\" and she ignored him. Eventually she decided to tell another worker to take our order. If this review relied on purely costumer service and cleanliness it would be one star (no stars if that was possible). Luckily the food was good & the smoothie as well. I like the smoothies and the food but hopefully the service improves."}
{"text":"First off-Let me start with the fact that I love Trop smoothie as a whole. I have never had anything subpar before. Yesterday I hadn't had a chance to eat lunch, and was starving by 2:30 pm. This was the closest location from where I was at for work.  I ordered a Health nut smoothie. The taste was delicious, until I started getting what seemed to be wirey bristles in every other sip. I don't know if something was cleaned with a wire brush, or what the foreign material was, but I threw out a $5.40 smoothie. I was SO disappointed. I considered calling the store, but it seems like a bunch of college/high school aged kids were running it when I went.  They definitely need to step up their game!"}
{"text":"This place is awful. I've been there three times and every single time I go they are out of key ingredients (e.g chicken, sugar). The place looks dirty and the employees do not know a thing about customer service."}
{"text":"The Smoothies are good, but the service is lacking.  Staff was unwilling to make a smoothie that was not on the menu even though all of the flavors were."}
{"text":"Came here this morning for a smoothie mid-morning. There were a few people sitting down with their food/smoothies and I could tell one guy was standing and waiting around for his order. There were three employees working at the time. I walked up to the counter and nobody acknowledged me. The employees were frantically running around not paying attention. Finally, what seemed to be the manager looks up a few minutes later and says \"we will be with you in a few minutes folks.\" I look behind me and there are now about 10 people waiting behind me to order. Minutes go by and he comes over to take everyone's order in line. I was the first person in line to order. He gets through the huge line of orders but there isn't anyone making smoothie orders as they come in. When he's finished taking orders he starts to make the smoothies but he wasn't making them in the order he rang them up in. I saw people in line behind me get their orders before me. I asked an employee if they called my name already and I missed it. I overheard her asking the manager and he rudely said he was backed up.  When he called my name when my smoothie was ready I said thank you and he just handed it to me and walked away. Poor customer service and the manager had a terrible attitude. If that's the way he treats his customers and staff during a rush he's clearly in the wrong business. Took over 30 minutes to get a smoothie when I was the first one in line!"}
{"text":"Really nice place. A bit pricy but I just love their great smoothies and the hummus wrap"}
{"text":"Just terrible.  Did take out for the convenience of the location, came home to find a crappily made Cranberry Chicken Salad sandwich.  It was disgusting (see picture) with the heel of the bread making up the sandwich...  Just terrible."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to Tropical Smoothie in a while and I was looking for a quick shot of wheat grass.  I ordered a smoothie and a double shot - smoothie came out quick but the wheat grass took longer than I expected.  I enjoyed the flavor very much, but don't care for it warm.  I'm not enough of a connoisseur to know if that's normal or not.

I was also disappointed to find out that they add sugar to their smoothies.  I didn't realize this, so didn't know to ask them to withhold it.  Seems a bit underhanded - it should be clearly posted as part of the ingredients.  Having said that, it explains why their smoothies are so tasty.  I'll chalk it up to \"buyer beware\" and know that they are a yummy treat, but not as nutritious as I had hoped."}
{"text":"Love you guys but I found that you guys use a lot of juices not fresh food. Still love to get one every once in a while but you guys need better ventilation. Smell weridish."}
{"text":"Very convenient location to stop by for a quick and refreshing smoothie! I ordered a Sunrise Sunset smoothie with strawberries, pineapple, mango & orange juice.  It was a delicious treat after a long day of hiking.

Clean and bright store with friendly staff. I have never tried their menu items, but may in the future if I'm looking some healthy quick options."}
{"text":"It is defiantly one of the healthier options around this area. I saw a movie and my friend and I got smoothies. She didn't find any that interest her, I got the peanut paradise. It wasn't thick when you drank it, and feels watered down. But as I kept drink it it seemed to thicken a little and get more flavor. I might come here again after another movie (ps Panda Express and Starbucks are next door)"}
{"text":"The best smoothies I've ever had..i go a few times a week..try the berry blast or the island intensity..its loaded with bananas, strawberries, and blueberries..also has acai and pomegranate juice..they also have sandwhiches, wraps, and soups..the soups are muy deliciouso!"}
{"text":"Made an online order and when I get there, they tell me they are out of half of the ingredients they need to make anything. So they can give me my smoothie, but not my sandwich or side. When I asked why I wasn't called, the cashier got an attitude with me and implied that I don't know my own number. They refused to give me a refund, saying if I wanted my sandwich I could come back tomorrow to get it. And seemed to have zero sympathy for how much they were inconveniencing me. BONUS - my smoothie had a hair in it! AVOID THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"I give this place 0 stars. I took to HS basketball players here for a quick lunch before a game. We are here from out of town. Inside was not busy at all but the did have a long line in their drive thru. 

I stood at the counter for 10 minutes with not one there. Finally a guy came up front and said he would be right with me. He went in the back for about 5 minutes and then walked outside to give someone an order. We still had not been waited on. So, we left. The guy passed us on our way to the car and said sorry guys we are busy. If this is the kind of service they offer I will not try another one."}
{"text":"Would be 0 stars if possible. I come here quite often for a smoothie and wrap. Every time I get shitty customer service. The people that work here must hate their life cause that's how they act. I understand having a bad day... But it's every time. Also how hard is it to make a wrap? Like seriously. They fall apart before the first bite."}
{"text":"5.99 for a smoothie made without real fruit. Save your time, and your money. Service is slow, and the employees didn't know how to enter in our BOGO coupon so we spent 15 bucks on two mediocre smoothies made with powder. Listen to the reviews on this one guys."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with this place, that I was compelled to write this almost as soon as I finished eating.
Took my daughter here for a smoothie I've been promising her, and we passed this place the other day, which said \"kids eat free 4p-7p with a purchase of adult paradise combo.\"
To keep this review down to less than a book, here are my positive and negative experiences:
-The staff is unfriendly and look depressed like someone beats them when they go in the back
-even with free kids meal, my meal was still $10 which was.....
-not even that great. I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap that was mediocre at best. My daughter said \"of all the pizza she'd ever had, they were better than this one,\" and I'd have to agree. It tasted like cardboard with ragu, microwaved.
-one size of smoothie for adults=too big
-my usual smoothie which I bought today, peanut butter cup tasted...somehow off. Not very flavorful and seemed watered down! like not enough things other than ice went in it.
-It took long. There was no one in the place when we walked in,and it took nearly 20 min to get mine/daughter's food. For microwave food, this is unacceptable.

You know, I can't think of anything positive here, except \"I'm glad I didn't ask my hubby to accompany us, or he'd a been mad too.\"
WIll not be returning.

By the way....this location does have a drive thru and its open 24 hrs-I don't even care,I won't be back.

The one on Charleston/Torrey Pines way blows this one away."}
{"text":"This place use to be my favorite!  You see this was my first job , my stomping grounds per say.  From 2006 till now it was amazing.  The smoothies haven't changed one bit still amazing as always but the food is gone to crap.  I have an allergy to gluten and specifically ordered a bowl only to get home with a wrap, immediately I called and they fixed it with telling me I could come get another one.  But yet again they made a wrap luckily this time I caught it before I got out the door.   But I came home opened up my \"salad/bowl\" and realized it was simply spinach.  It's way too expensive to pay for a bowl of spinach.  Sadly I will no longer recommend TSC except for their smoothies."}
{"text":"I've never had a problem with this location till recently. I come to the drive through and Brandi the girl working the drive through was really patient and nice until I got to the window. I handed her my card and tried to get her attention to have her scan my points for the rewards program. She ignores me and shuts the window to talk to her coworkers, she reopened the window and I said \"is it to late to scan this I tried to get your attention but you must of not heard me.\" She replies with \"yeah the headsets in my ear.\" She was busy still talking to her coworkers. I'm now waiting in the drive through for 20 minutes. I'm the only one in line. As I'm waiting I look into the window and see everyone laughing and messing around as well as recording each other on Snapchat. The order is completed a few minutes later and she hands me my smoothie and food and she quickly tries to shut the window. I got her attention and asked where my second smoothie is she replies with \"what was your drink?\" I look for my receipt cause I could not remember the name and she scoffs and rolls her eyes saying \"really?\" I finally found the receipt and told her the drink. She begins to argue with me that she doesn't have the ticket for it and she repeated it back to me, all of this said with a snarky tone. I just said it's fine and drove off. I will never return to this location after tonight's awful experience."}
{"text":"Called my order in at 10:30 am via phone. took 15 mins to place order via phone. Arrived at 11:30 am, food is STILL not ready for pick up. Finally left the store at 12:02pm. Slow Service, and was late to a lunch meeting due to this. Owner needs to hire more people if they can not keep up with the demand of customers."}
{"text":"I really like this location for two reasons:

1. 10% off for LVAC Members when you show your Membership card
2. 24 hour Drive-Thru

They have an assorted choice of Low Fat, Specialty and Coffee Smoothies here. My favorites being Hawaiian Breeze (Pineapple, Orange and Non-fat Yogurt), Health Nut (Blueberries, Mango, Banana, Almonds, and your choice of either Whey or Soy protein), Acai Berry Boost (Acai, Pomegranate, Bananas, Blueberries and Strawberries).

And they also have a variety of food choices from salads to toasted wraps and Flatbreads. I had one of the wraps before, it was the Sesame Chicken. It was ok...the sauce they used in it was too strong for me, and very sweet ( in my opinion), and they used a lot which in turn made my wrap a bit soggy. However my favorite to order here is the Baja Chicken Flat Bread. Its Chicken, mozzarella cheese, green and red peppers, some onions, romaine lettuce and i think it was southwest ranch all on flat bread. Yum!!! 

They also have punch cards here!! Oh yea!"}
{"text":"Great smoothies at this location! Delicious food as well. They always come out with new sandwiches and wraps"}
{"text":"We've come here several times and their smoothies are great!  Haven't tried their food yet, however.  The prices of their smoothies are very reasonable and their taste is comparable to Smoothie King or Jamba.  Check it out if u r in the area!"}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place. While the smoothies are delicious, the service and climate of hospitality lacks tremendously! They make no effort to smile, greet you or even look up as they take your order. However, I will continue to go here because it's still better than Jamba"}
{"text":"The chicken salad sandwich was great!  I could have done without the smoothie.  I expected it to be better since smoothie is in the name.  I had the Mango magic and couldn't taste any of the mango.  This is located in the Excalibur food court and a good alternative to the fast food places on either side."}
{"text":"Maybe they have a new staff or I just got lucky. The 4young ladies working in there today are very nice and fast. I was in and out in 6 minutes with the smoothie and wrapped in hand. 2 greeted me when I walked in and even shouted 'have a nice day!' As I was getting ready to walk out. there was 2 cars in the drive through and it seemed that they were served quickly also. The smoothie and wrap tasted just like any other tropical smoothie and the store is very new and clean. I will definitely be returning specially since they are open 24 hours!"}
{"text":"Walked in behind another customer and after they were rung up, I was not greeted at all. The girl went into the back to make smoothies. All the while, another employee was at the front the whole time filling out paperwork and on her phone without greeting anyone. It wasn't until there were 2 more people in line behind me that she said she'd be right with us and went back to her paperwork. It wasn't until another minute of standing there that I was serviced at all because I asked if anyone else was working there. Great smoothies, awful attitudes."}
{"text":"They seem to have one size of smoothies,which is big and over $5, which is where I aim to spend on my entire meal, but whatever, that day I just wanted a smoothie with banana and peanut butter. I found 2 on the menu and somehow I ended up getting the chocolatey one-chocolate peanut butter and banana. 
It was ok, I could barely taste the banana over the other two ingredients. Next time I'll get the protein banana shake.
As fas as the place itself-SUper noisy...above all the machines going, there was a big crowd in there who didn't even appear to be enjoying anything from there. Service was super slow and I had a time constraint. Went with a friend who didn't seem too particularly excited about his shake either.
I didn't buy food there, since I already ate and my main intent was solely for the smoothie. I'd probably be back again to try the other shake:)"}
{"text":"This place is just slow to take and receive your order. First in line and have to wait 20min to take my order? Hopefully your lucky to get your order right. What a joke this place gets worst and worst each i stop by. Great food horrible customer service."}
{"text":"Clearly this location does not emphasize customer service. There were only two people working during peak hour. One couldn't get the smoothies straight. The other greeted what seemed to be an out of uniform employee who asked him to get something from the back. In the middle of a packed store with 8 people each waiting for multiple smoothies, the guy stopped making smoothies, went to the back, came back with some papers and proceeded to chat it up with his friend. Slow as snails. No sense of urgency what so ever. Customers come first. The guy's friend should have waited for things to die down before he received what he needed. This place needs to get it together! You clearly have the traffic so get some more competent employees. Smoothie making is not that difficult!

On a side note, it felt like there was no A/c running which is dangerous for customers and employees."}
{"text":"Great alternative for a healthy lunch. Little spends, but I love the smoothies so it is worth it. I work nearby and get to walk here once a week so for a smoothie break."}
{"text":"The worst bathrooms ever! They smell like sewage and they are filthy! You might just want to hold it...."}
{"text":"The staff here are great and very helpful also knowledgeable. I love the way they run the place plus it's clean. They introduced us to their sandwiches and they were so amazing and scrumptious. You'll have to check this location out cause it'll be worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I come here once every 2 weeks during the day and never had a problem until now. I decided to stop here before work. 
Their drive through hours say they open at 6am.
I got there at 6:07am and NOBODY was there! Extremely disappointed!!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time to get a smoothie. My friends have been coming to these locations for quite some, so I decided to give it a try. There was such LONG LINE! Got the sunrise sunset, could use a little bit more sugar, but other than that,  it's pretty good."}
{"text":"Their smoothies are super good! I also tried the Thai Chicken Wrap the last time I was there and it was delicious"}
{"text":"I love Tropical Smoothie Cafe. They have some of the best smoothies, and the prices are reasonable. I haven't tried any of their food items however. My favorite smoothie is the Chia Banana with peanut butter. I also like the Island Green and Sunny Day. I would recommend getting the app so you can add up points for rewards. 

As far as this location, I've never had any issues. Service is good and quick, and the smoothies are pretty consistent."}
{"text":"Not all Tropical Smoothie Cafe's are created equal. And unfortunately this place earned my first one star. This location needs a serious revamp. First of all, they're highly under-staffed, and I appreciated the one employee doing all he could. But he was overwhelmed, and it took awhile to take our order. And it was really hot in there. Perhaps problems with their A/C? The young man was great, apologetic and made our drinks. Unfortunately, he made my drink wrong. He offered to fix it, but it wasn't much better. I don't fault him, that's a lack of training. He also informed me that they were having a problem with their POS system so my rewards didn't register. I can't fault him, but this location needs help."}
{"text":"I love Tropical Smoothie but this location is almost always under staffed. I have often walked in to a line of 5+ people, one register person, and one person making food and smoothies, and waited over 20 minutes for my smoothie order. I'll continue to come here, but will walk out if there are more than 3 people in line when I get there."}
{"text":"This is close to my home and makes for a nice default choice when I am craving something semi healthy or a smoothie. I generally opt for the Sunrise Sunset smoothie and one of their wraps. I find them highly overpriced for the quality of the food. The smoothies are fine, and it is nice to have some options with extra boosters as well. They are quick, the staff is generally nice and to the point. I think it is sheer convenience that has me coming back here when I need my smoothie fix or just want to trick myself into thinking that I am eating something healthy."}
{"text":"Thank you Cheyenne Tropical Smoothie Cafe for always making my Island Green Smoothie so amazing that I'm actually sad when it's all gone. I've never had a sandwich here so I've never had to wait very long for my drink, even when I've ordered two(I barely sit down when they're calling my name) It tastes the same every single time. Stays nice and cold as I baby it all afternoon. Competition in the area are poorly staffed (taking ten minutes to make three smoothies) and refuse to put ingredients like pineapple or even ice in veggie drinks. See my review of Berry Blendz. I will not deviate again. You are the bomb!"}
{"text":"The smoothies and food is really good!! But the place is always super gross and dirty. The employees walk on banana peels, and if you're unlucky enough to look back into the kitchen area, you'll see just how little they clean back there. The employees are all young college kids, and maybe more adult management would help. I was pretty grossed out the last time I went there. Haven't been back since."}
{"text":"I've come here a handful of times and u get decent service. I would come here a lot more if they were open when they say they are!!! Open at 6 yet at 745 they are closed still! I work in the same shopping center and try to grab a little something before I start at 8 but nope. However the drive thru is open but I walk."}
{"text":"I have been to this location 3 times, and the service was fast/employees were polite, the food was good, & the atmosphere was clean &  beach inspired. I like Tropical Smoothie b/c it has relatively healthy options served fast & it is reasonably affordable."}
{"text":"Wish I had read these reviews before wasting $8 here. This place has no redeeming qualities. I stopped in for a \"healthy\" lunch on the go. Ordered the buffalo wrap with just buffalo chicken and mozzarella (yes I know it's plain) and it took quite a while to make. I didn't mind the wait because I assumed that meant it would be super fresh...wrong! What I got was a cold tortilla drenched in buffalo sauce, unmelted cheese and a few chunks of dry chicken. Absolutely disgusting. 

Only thing worse than the food was the customer service, if you can even call it that. The girl behind the counter was very short and rude. Not one \"hi, thank you, have a good day\" or anything resembling friendliness. Also, there was a lady who I assume was the manager or owner doing an interview right there in the middle of the eating area. The interview started and ended before I even got my food, and the lady interviewing him sounded as short and rude as the girl working the counter. The interviewee should consider himself lucky if he doesn't get the job."}
{"text":"The smoothies are good here, but don't go to this location at night while the C squad is on.  They're to busy on their phones in the back to get the ingredients right in your meal. I ordered a chicken bacon flatbread, but they forgot to add the bacon. They also ran out of blueberries and mango. The 2 main ingredients in the smoothies I like to order."}
{"text":"So we decided to give this one a third chance.  Never had a chance to order.  The service was ridiculously slow.   We waited 15 minutes and got no acknowledgment.  People in front us left.  People in back of us left.   The employees moved slower than sloths. 
My daughter stopped a couple of weeks ago to the drivethru.  They never acknowledged her at the kiosk. After a few minutes she went to the window and sat there.  Rudely the person asked what she wanted so she left.  
 So needless to say we will not be back.   Ever."}
{"text":"Tropical Smoothie is Tropical Smoothies. It's always hit or miss, always depends on who's making your drink and preparing your food. I give it an extra star only because its dine-in is open 24 hours."}
{"text":"If you want to get bad service, if you want to wait 25 mins to get a smoothie, and listen to gangster rap while waiting, this is the place."}
{"text":"The smoothies are delicious, and it's nice that they have wheat grass shots. but I was really disappointed when we went there for lunch. All of the food is pre made and cannot be made custom to order. The sandwich bread was rubbery and soggy. I was not impressed!"}
{"text":"Went here today for the first time and I am just shocked! 

We went inside and waited a good 5 minutes or so before even being acknowledged. At first I felt bad that there was just one guy working, but that sympathy went out the window when the guy literally LEFT to go talk to some girl outside. I mean, really? We honestly wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt, being as the dude had 4 drive thru tickets (there's a monitor next to the menu that shows the tickets he had) plus our ticket, but seriously you're just gonna leave like that? Super unprofessional. 

After 25 minutes we get our 2 smoothies and salad, none of which were worth the money. Salad was sad and limp and smoothies were bland and watery. 

After reading some of these reviews I'm VERY surprised this place is still in business! 

Management, get your shit together.
Yelpers, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME HERE!"}
{"text":"Update 05/18/18: I went back one month ago to see if anything had changed. It's worse. I sat in the drive thru at the microphone saying \"I'm ready\" and not a single person replying back for five minutes. After said five minutes, I pulled up to the window and asked wtf the problem was. The girl apologized and said \"I'm not the one with the headset\". I felt bad because I was clearly being rude and the girl was becoming mildly emotional at my reaction, so I apologized and told her to inform the person on the microphone she is doing a shit job and she should AT THE VERY LEAST inform whoever is at the mic she'll be a second versus ignoring them completely. I informed the girl I did not want anything and I left. I will NEVER EVER come back to a Tropical Smoothie EVER again. What a complete shit show of a shop. Jamba Juice is 1000x better and hires workers that actually work."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 0 stars. I've been giving this shop chance after chance for the past few years since I live around the area & I love my smoothies. Usually the experiences aren't that bad. To be honest, the customer service there will always be crappy but I don't even care because people are miserable & that's not my problem. However, I don't appreciate drinking crappy smoothies, especially if I paid for it. They're usually either very watery or they're not blended enough to where I'm actually eating ice. This location sucks. Go to the one on Flamingo & Grand Canyon; it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Love the food but the service is terrible at this location. A bunch of kids with an attitude."}
{"text":"I'm not one to post a review ... hardly ever. But my experience with this location has been the absolute worst! I am a regular at tropical smoothie (different location) I wait 20 MINUTES to get a smoothie. There was 3 workers inside. And one car in front of me. They waited just as long for their order. Completely disappointed."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place five stars. I'm supportive of minority owners and the Asian lady who owns the place reminds me of my family who work hard and own their own businesses.

My advice to her is this: have enough staff so youre not short handed. A few times I've come and there was a line and taking forever so I left. 

As owner, always greet your customers. I stood at the register and you seemed moody so I didn't feel welcome. 

Make sure employees say hello with a smile. It's the small things that matter. Watch \"the profit\" on msnbc. You'll learn some great small business tips. That way you won't be caught with missing item menus like today ;)"}
{"text":"Honestly the other times I've come here the wait in the line has been more than 10 minutes for a SMOOTHIE. No one else in the line besides me either"}
{"text":"My favorite place for a healthy snack! They just need to work on the speed of the service. Don't stop if you don't have 15 minutes to stand around and wait."}
{"text":"I haven't been terribly disappointed with the smoothies and actually haven't been inside the location.  My concern is with how dirty the drive thru area is.  The windows are disgusting and there's always trash lying around.  I don't want to think about the kitchen..  This could easily be rectified by decent management."}
{"text":"We love this place. 
Great Wasabi beef sandwich. 

And the smoothies are awesome. 

We drive out of our way to come here on a Sunday when we are shooting at Rio. 

The best is a great attitude and happy smile when you walk in."}
{"text":"I waited 30 minutes for a shake. This is ridiculous. The staff are understaffed and don't have the tools to make things on time. Horrible experience. I will be telling people I know not to come here."}
{"text":"their vegetarian meat makes this place so good! It fails though that there is always only one employee working, makes absolutely no sense. And a couple times they were out of the veggie meat and they had me wait 10- 15 min before telling me and another time, a kid gave me actual chicken. Now I just make sure to ask right away that they have it - wish they would pull it together bc their wraps and flatbreads are amazing and 24-7!"}
{"text":"I know this place is fairly new which makes me want to give them a little bit of a pass, but if you want to survive in the food business you need to make a good impact from the start to keep customers coming back. We came to Tropical Smoothie because my brother loved the one he frequented in Florida. We ordered the Big Kahuna meal for our little one with the Turkey Cheddar & whatever the name of the strawberry/banana smoothie is, the Americana breakfast wrap, the Super Green Cesar wrap, the Hummus wrap and the Hummus wrap unwrapped as a salad, and lastly the Beach Bum smoothie with white chocolate.

The first two ingredients in the Hummus Wrap are hummus and smashed avocado--neither the wrap nor the salad had either one...I'm not sure how this is possible, but it happened.

The Beach Bum smoothie had decent flavor, but a weird texture (grainy and chunks of ice).

The Super Green Cesar wrap tasted fine, but wasn't anything out of this world for $8.

The breakfast wrap is smaller than their standard wrap, but I asked beforehand if it was since the price reflects that--no issue there. Also the kids \"meal\" was fine except that the cup of fruit had the apple stem and piece of core in it.

Our order was to-go and they called my name and handed me the bag. I took a quick peek and noticed the kid's food was not in there and mentioned it when the guy returned with a fork. The response was oh yeah that is coming up in a minute. Fine, but  if I was in a hurry I would have probably left with my bag after they handed it to me.

Lastly, my husband noticed that all the containers are open and the food was being cross contaminated every time they took a scoop of something; it would drip into the other container as they took the scoop of food. The employees also did not have any gloves or hair nets on, which I believe is fairly standard when handling food.

All in all our $40 purchase was lackluster and really quite disappointing."}
{"text":"Fantastic smoothie shop! Vonetta is awesome! Best customer service ever! highly recommend. Thank you for a great experience"}
{"text":"I just come here for the smoothies. They never disappoint. Glad there's a smoothie place open 24 hours to fit my extremely odd work schedule."}
{"text":"THE WORST! SO TERRIBLE! HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! RUDE RUDE RUDE! these people straight up do not give a crap about customers or their jobs! i've tried coming to this location twice now and both times have been a beyond miserable experience. they act like i'm bothering them by ordering a smoothie! i've never experienced anything this bad in my life. it deserves negative stars! other locations are no better either. way to turn away customers and loose business! you guys are aweful! thumbs down!"}
{"text":"I got one of the best smoothie for breakfast plus a peanut sandwich was perfect honey and granola !"}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever had. First of all its way too hot inside, second I was givin the wrong smoothie and got an attitude from the girl because she heard me wrong, and lastly I waited over 15 minutes for half a sandwich. I will never be back and to top it off I've never had to write a bad review in my life. Terrible"}
{"text":"There is always a long wait and the staff isn't ever friendly. Tonight I waited for over 30 minutes and there were only 4 cars in line. Ridiculous. You lost my business!!"}
{"text":"I get that it's Christmas Eve but there's no line, three girls in the back are talking and laughing while we waited in front for 2-3 minutes. I looked back twice to see if they saw us. In the middle of her taking my order she engages another girl in conversation, talks to another customer that walks up asking for something when the two girls in the back could've helped. Super annoyed and she wasn't even nice. Probably could've cared less. Not really interested in coming back to this location."}
{"text":"Got done amazing recommended suggestions from the staff here!! Smoothie & a breakfast wrap on the way!"}
{"text":"The place is close to lunch for me. Have been here a few times. The product is great and the service is on and off. Not sure if the staffing levels are correct or not but seems everyone before or after me had to wait a while and some of the orders were mixed up. Had a Açaí berry smoothie. Was great."}
{"text":"We stop in several mornings a week and Andy is always quick and super friendly.  This location seems to have a bad rap, but I've never had a bad morning when Andy is working!"}
{"text":"When this location gets enough employees to handle the volume, and answer the phones for call ahead orders, I'll give them five stars.  Employees are running ragged trying to get things done as quick as possible (although they could clean up their language when frustrated in the back). But they are still smiling and friendly, food and smoothies always good."}
{"text":"Brandon is the best! Amazing smoothies and the entire staff always makes me feel special!!!"}
{"text":"Why is it 10 pm and all the lights are off and the door locked with the open sign still on? Supposed to close at 2 am my ass."}
{"text":"This place really needs an adult manager around to ensure these frowny-faced high school girls are performing their jobs expeditiously and even perhaps enthusiastically. Here's an idea: use that same fake smile and positive attitude you used to get hired on the customers. When the smoothie creating is right up front, it's typically a good idea to look and act appropriately and perhaps appreciative of your employment."}
{"text":"The absolute slowest tropical smoothie I have ever been to and I went to one that the employee only had one arm and was still faster. Never again this place"}
{"text":"This place is THE WORST. I ordered a chicken salad sandwich and a smoothie via Uber eats. Driver was great friendly. Tropical smoothie though.. the smoothie was fine, but I didn't get my fruit meledy and when I bit into my sandwich all I got was bread. Enough chicken in there for one sandwich. MAYBE. I called and there was no manager and no supervisors. Wtf? Really?? This place is awful. I will NEVER purchase anything from this location again."}
{"text":"This is the best location in town!  I live closer to the \"other\" location at Cheyenne & 215 and even with their drive thru, I'll always go a few extra miles for the great customer service and care with the food prep here.  The owner, Kay, is one of the most gracious and genuinely kind people you can meet.  The staff is always friendly, with a smile!  With a few other reviews I've read, especially referring to the drive thru, they are reviewing the wrong location.  This is at Cheyenne and Buffalo, with other restaurants nearby; including The Cracked Egg (another breakfast great).  Have been going to this Tropical since they opened and it's simply the best!"}
{"text":"Great food at reasonable price. Portion size is just right, as in satisfies the hunger and doesn't make you feel full."}
{"text":"The service is always slow, even when its not busy. The employees don't seem to be very motivated. This place needs some competent management.
The smoothies are good. Ive never had the food. The kitchen (if you could call it that) doesn't look like the food coming from it would be very appetizing."}
{"text":"I have stop going to tropical smoothie because I was constantly getting served watered-down smoothies that had absolutely no flavor, from this location... 
I have recently I started going to other tropical smoothies  locations and was satisfied so today I decided to try the Grand Canyon location once again, and what did I get? a watered-down smoothie!! I will never go to this location again."}
{"text":"Toaster was down so they only offered salads and smoothies. So we ordered a smoothie.  We tried using our coupon from checking in with Yelp and she said she was sorry but per owner they could not give us the discount. But in there window there is a sticker asking you to \"Love us on Yelp.\"  Well that was a little misleading. On a side note the smoothie did come out fast."}
{"text":"Tropical smoothie cafe is an interesting place, you can get away eating healthy if you know what you are getting. I prefer to get their smoothies as a meal replacement or add a bunch of protein to it after a nice work out. They do have some good food options; like wraps, sandwiches, salads, burritos and etc. 

The main reason why this location gets 3 stars is that a lot of times the team members who work, seem to only be there to collect their paycheck with minimal focus on customer service. I ordered a thai salad and lets just says that it was done in a hurry without adding all the ingredients. I barely had any dressing on it and the chicken felt like it was microwaved for 2 minutes. 

Good news is that you can't mess up the smoothies since there are quick recipes labeled on a board for each recipe. I got their new Island green smoothie with Splenda, Pinaple, mango and other island fruits made the flavor very refreshing. I would highly recommend this smoothie to anyone. 

Overall, staff needs be better trained and more enthused about their job at this location. Also, the parking is also pretty lousy."}
{"text":"Never again!  They took so long making the food that I had to just leave so I could get back to work.  The guy making the food was even walking at a slower pace than a 105 year old.  When his co-worker asked if he need help the guy just shrugged him off and said no I got it.  Now I'm at work having to order grub hub so my blood sugar doesn't tank.  Corporate really needs to look at this place it is just a really poor reflection on the company name."}
{"text":"Dirty place the dust is so thick on the menu... above it on the sides floors where not cleaned"}
{"text":"I get the berry razer most of the time which is their strawberry and banana smoothie. I've tried their peanut butter and banana one and didn't like it quite as much. The servers are cool and normally pretty quick. Avoid meeting here for business since the noise from the blenders can be a bit loud."}
{"text":"Great food and smoothies but horrible customer service. Everyone working still speaks as if they are in high school and being forced to talk to you when taking our order. They used to be 24 hour drive thru but recently changed it to close at 2am. Tonight me and another car in front of me arrived at the same time, 1:30, after the car in front of me sat there for five minutes he pulled off it was then my turn. No one ever greeted me through the intercom I repeatedly said hello? Hello? Only to never be answered and follow he car in front of me by leaving. As I left I knocked on the window and still no one came it was only as I slowly drove off in he parking lot could I see someone emerge from the back where they were hiding. Very disappointing that they have employees like that. Wanted a good healthy meal at 1am but this poor employee stopped thy from happening. Really wish this employee would suffer some type of disciplinary actions. Other than the service I really do like their food and smoothies."}
{"text":"Good location, not so great service. Took forever and it's always super cold inside, what the f*ck!"}
{"text":"Smoothie was wonderful .... Service is horrible! Front cashier was answering calls and delivering drinks with a full line out of the door. I waited more than 25 min for a smoothie! Watched people walk out and I would've if I didn't already pay for my drink!!!!"}
{"text":"I love tropical smoothie but this is by far the worst one in Vegas. I keep on giving this place a chance since it's the closest trop to my house but I feel like each time I come my outlook on it gets worse and worse. I came today for a smoothie and a breakfast wrap but was surprised to see a no food sign on the door. I walk in and look in the back and there's clearly food the girls obviously must've been to lazy to make it. The two that were working today are the ones I feel like I always see in there and let me just say HORRIBLE customer service. HORRIBLE ATTITUDES. Last time I came in and asked the small girl about the buy two smoothies get a third free during the happy hour and she looked at me with the most stank face and stank attitude and just said yeah. Every time I come in no one is at the front the girls are always in the back gossiping letting lines of customers build up. For this location being in such a busy, high commercial area, the customer service and reviews should be much better, very disappointing it isn't."}
{"text":"Good place for smoothies & I love their food. However, The service at this store is extremely slow. Employees who work here move at such a slow pace. Where is the sense of urgency when there are 5 ppl in line and some even order in more than 1 smoothie? 1 cashier, and 1 guy in the back. At one point there was just one guy working the entire thing and he was on his cell phone the entire time. You have to come here when there are no customers that way you get your order out on time."}
{"text":"What a find for us! My husband and I like to eat \"healthy\" and we also like Starbucks. This little sleeper (to us) is right next door to Starbucks
We shared a turkey, spinach leaf and tomato sandwich on their \"seedelicious\" bread. Excellent! Their menu offers many healthful choices -- from multiple grains rice bowls to flat bread sandwiches and various taco choices. 
Their signature offerings are smoothies, but we did not try one. I did notice, to their credit, they had no syrup offerings. 
We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is the worst tropical smoothie location I have ever been to. This is my second time coming to this location and the drive thru wait is EXTREMELY long. There are not even any customers. I do not even get what the heck are doing inside. This location needs new employees who can do their job in a fast manner"}
{"text":"Prices and portions are a little better than Jamba Juice, and food selection is decent.

Went by late last night, I  got one of their superfood smoothies- the Mean Green(?), with kale and spinach and mango and pineapple. Get it with Splenda to save some cals, and the smoothie is a meal at 380 cals. Very filling, very tasty, very sweet.

Joined their website and got an email for a 99 cent smoothie with purchase of a sandwich or wrap. Before I got a chance to even print that up, another coupon came up for TODAY- $1.99 for their curry chicken salad or wrap, and it's decent. Don't know if I'd pay full price for it, but coupons and deals seem to come around often.


EDIT:
Apparently this location's management is now picking and choosing when to honor the company website coupons. I understand franchises are able to opt out of promotions, and the small print always states \"at participating locations\", but if they honor one they should honor all. And with all of the smoothie competition they have in this area, and my observations of the amount of business they do, they can't really afford to be turning away customers.
I'll be spending my money elsewhere from now on- getting turned away for a $2 discount coupon that is ON THE COMPANY WEBSITE was a total waste of my lunch break today (3/26/14). If you're going to benefit from the advertising your host company provides, you need to honor their discounts as well."}
{"text":"Probably won't be coming back to this tropical smoothie ever again. First time I went here it took 20 mins for two drinks and there was only 2 cars in the drive thru. Went back again today and it took almost 30 mins and we were the only car today. Bad Customer service and they also put tomatoes when I told them not to."}
{"text":"Fruit blending should be a lot quicker. Thought I could pop in and grab a smoothie and waited almost 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Visited this location a few times and every time I go, it just smells bad. All of the counters and tables are dirty and there is only one person working. This location gets business from customers, but the experience is ruined by waiting too long or the person behind the counter touches his face and doesn't wash his hands after. Never again..."}
{"text":"Ordered HUMMUS veggie wrap. Very little to almost no hummus, no asparagus and no pepper jack cheese"}
{"text":"Seriously... I can't tell you how excited I am to find this Tropical Smoothie!!! 

I thought I had to give up on this place since moving from VA, but what a wonderful accident to stumble into this place!! It's in a shopping center right behind the Taco Bell, with very friendly staff and tons of options to enjoy and eat. 

Today, I went with the Blimey Limey which is a mix of strawberries, pineapple, orange and lime. Easily one of my favorite smoothies here...when I'm feeling super \"healthy\" I get it Splenda which knocks off some calories but not to worry the blend of fruits make it sweet enough and it's the perfect size more then enough to leave you satisfied. 

But this place has much more than just smoothies! There are tons of wraps and salads and sandwiches. 

I'm so excited to know that place is here and I can't wait to come back...especially with summer coming....oh yeah!!!!"}
{"text":"It's the best tropical smoothie in Las Vegas.  They have several locations and this is the best by far. The girls are very sweet and welcoming. However be prepared to wait a little for your lunch order because it's truly made fresh but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"smoothie a day keeps the doctor away! get up and goji buy far the best."}
{"text":"Smoothies are alright, but I just don't see myself choosing this smoothie shop over others. I was the only one in line at the drive thru and waited 10 minutes for 1 wrap."}
{"text":"This location used to be great, had good service, fresh sandwiches and great smoothie's. The last couple of times going there, within about a weeks time, it seems to be going down hill. The service is getting a lot slower and seems very inexperienced, and the food and smoothies are getting worse. Hopefully the owners start taking notice and rectifies the situation before its to late because there's not another one of these around this area."}
{"text":"Wish this place wasn't so expensive, but I do love everything on their menu. I love their smoothies! And I love getting their text exclusive deals on my phone!"}
{"text":"Took too much time to find a parking spot.  Been standing for 5 mins, so far,,,,waiting to put in my order.  Only 2 people wotking, not there fault.  Whoever owns this one will you get somemore help?"}
{"text":"Smoothies are the best yet!!! Service is really slow. Both times I have been here, there seems to only be one person working...

Waited thirty minutes for two smoothies in the drive thru... So if your in a hurry and are expecting to get your smoothies in less then 5 minutes this is definitely not the place."}
{"text":"The food is ok the smoothies are good but for the love of God do not go here if you are in a hurry you will be late everytime I've gone I'm in the drive through from anywhere between 20-30 min for one smoothie there was even a time when I was the only person there and still waited that long and when I finally got my smoothie they tried to hand me someone else's as well by the time I finally left the drive through had about 6 cars in it all waiting I work off hours and a 24/7 smoothie place no matter how slow is still amazing to me, just be sure to check your order there's a 50/50 chance it's wrong"}
{"text":"Soooo slooooow.  The smoothies and sandwiches are always great but it takes forever to get your food or smoothie.  I feel bad for the employees, there is typically only two girls working for the morning rush."}
{"text":"Tropical Smoothie..yummy! Yummy! I had the turkey bacon ranch on cibatta sandwhich, it was delicious. I like that it came with a healthy side I had a banana..but you could get other healthy choices with it. I also ordered a smoothie of course, it was the get up goji which had peaches,banana,orange,goji, and non-fat yogurt. I liked it. I also like that they have a Happy Hour from 2p-4p so buy two smoothies get one free..awesome! Overall good experience with service,food, etc. I like that it wasn't very busy...I'm thinking its the location."}
{"text":"Like everyone else has said here, the wait is ridiculous. This location is right by my house, so sometimes I make the mistake of stopping in when there doesn't seem to be a line. It's criminally understaffed, usually by high school kids who can't look you in the eye when they take your order. Even when you're the only person in there, you end up waiting for 15 minutes or more for your order. 

This place could do way better business if they were willing to invest a little extra in more and better trained staff. The wait time is infamous with everyone in our neighborhood who would otherwise frequent this location."}
{"text":"I had stopped frequenting as much as I used to but the few times I have stopped in since they remodeled, my smoothies have been tasting better! My mobile orders have been ready when promised but most importantly they taste great and makes it worth my money. Truth be told, most times I place my orders online and have the BF pick them up so I can't speak for the customer service itself but as long as they taste great I'm happy."}
{"text":"Hard to find any juice bars or healthy eats in North Las Vegas so I was excited when I found this on yelp. I thought I'd like it more though. 

Bahama mama (3.5 stars): Hint of white chocolate is really good. Couldn't taste much other than strawberry though. 

I'll definitely come back to try more and to try the food, probably one of the few healthier alternatives around here.

Place is clean, 2 cute purple chairs to relax in. Drive through is awesome to have in the heat! 

Service was great! Lady that helped us was super nice."}
{"text":"I give this store a 3 star because I love their smoothies.  The service however is a different story. I come here a lot. yesterday I watched a lady walk out the door without being acknowledged after waiting quite awhile.  Sometimes the music is so loud you can't stand it. In the last few weeks my smoothies haven't been good . I even took one back and the manager had to make me another. people should be greeted when they walk through the door. Still  I won't quit going. I would just like to see a resemblance of professionalism."}
{"text":"I always come here to get my late night \"island green\" smoothie fix. The staff is always friendly, and tonight was no exception. The young lady at the counter was so sweet and I had my smoothie in hand a minute after I ordered. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I came in to order and there were 2 girls working . One was busy the other was doing nothing and did not say hi or take my order . As I continued waiting at the counter right in front of her, she walked In her back ,finally I left . Wow"}
{"text":"I've been to Tropical Smoothie a handful of times, and I am always hoping for a better experience than I had the previous time. I am often disappointed due to the unfriendly, slow, and unprofessional service. If you are in a rush, forget stopping in for a smoothie- it once took them 25 minutes for them to get out one smoothie. The dining room and drive thru were both not too crowded. They were even out of their usual cups and I was handed a generic (and smaller) styrofoam cup when my drink finally came out. 

The two stars I did give is for the quality of the product. It's ALMOST (but not fully) worth the long wait when you take the first sip of your smoothie. The Beach Bum with white chocolate is their best drink in my opinion. 

If the owners/management can improve their service, their ratings and reviews will certainly rise. For now, I'll stick to a McDonalds' smoothie."}
{"text":"Love this smoothie place. My favorite smoothie flavor is the Bahama Mama. Must try at least once!! It's flavorful with bursts of pineapple, strawberry, creamy with the white chocolate chip and topped with coconut flavor, which is not that powerful. It is good for me because I am not a huge fan of strong coconut flavors. The staff is nice and quickly make my order. I know they also serve food but I have not had the chance to try it. Will review when I get the chance to try it."}
{"text":"I've never bothered writing a review but I would have to agree with other reviewers. THIS IS THE WORST LOCATION!  They couldn't get my order right, the food came out cold, the cheese in my flatbread wasnt melted, and the employees didn't close the smoothie lid tight---which caused HAVOC in my new car!!!! Even if the place is close to my house...I'm NEVER GOING BACK!!"}
{"text":"I was there just now. I'm first in line. I ordered 1 smoothie. The guy behind me orders three the girl behind him orders one and a sandwich or something. Reason I know this is because I seen them get their stuff. I got my smoothie last. I ask the girl that had originally taken my order, what happened to my smoothie? I ordered before everyone else. She looks over and sees it just sitting there. Didn't even apologize. I get back to work and there's huge chunks it won't suck thru the straw, I mean so many large ice chunks! WTF! eff this place."}
{"text":"National Flip Flop Day's fundraiser drew me to Tropical Smoothie yesterday and even though I wasn't able to get there 2-7 pm during the free smoothie offer with donations accepted for Camp Sunshine, I still went to support this amazing cause and buy a late dinner and donate. I didn't grow up near a Tropical Smoothie or drinking smoothies at all so it's not something I'm familiar with so it took me awhile to decide what I wanted and the employees were patient and helpful. The place was near empty so no one was waiting behind me, they said the rush had ended and earlier in the day they had a 20 min wait for a free smoothie. There was one young employee with special needs working alongside an aid so that he could get job training skills with support which is fantastic. The spinach & feta omelet was decent and the raspberry smoothie was good but huge, I'm still working on it a day later. What will bring me back is the philanthropy of the company and the kindness of the employees. The teenager at the cash register was so eager to learn about Camp Sunshine and excited to tell me that their location hopes to send 3 families there and I was able to let her know about the volunteer experience too. Camp Sunshine has sessions that bring children with rare life-threatening illnesses to camp and allows for their parents and siblings to receive support too and although the camp program is free, it's located in Maine and hard for families to afford to get there. Thank you Tropical Smoothie for making this possible! I have recommended your location to everyone who will listen."}
{"text":"Dude c'mon.  First of all the only reason I'm giving them 3 stars is because the guy working w her was running circles around this girl. She first of all didnt smile hunched over looking miserable. She made our smoothies which when the other guy took two orders made 2 smoothies and sandwiches, she still didn't have our smoothies.  When she finally finished they were soaking wet and the other guy had to hand them to us. Unmarked and could the tell he hates working with her cos it was seriously gllooommmyyy in there. So karalynn or whatever I think you need a change of occupation."}
{"text":"Just left without being served. Two employees behind the wall, one on break. No one came out to take my order or even greeted me through the window."}
{"text":"This is my weekday lunch spot.  Smoothies are consistently good, staff is friendly, and service is fast.  The Acai Berry Boost is delicious.  Something about the smell of a smoothie place just makes you feel good.  Wish this location had a drive thru for those hot summer afternoons."}
{"text":"The smoothies are delicious. I can not deny that! But the food and service are terrible at this location! Every single time I have ever been here my food has come out burnt and falling apart. Skip the food and just stick to the smoothies."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed my Tropical Smoothie, but check this out; I had no clue that you could get them to mix practically anything...

Peanut Butter + Banana + Coffee = New Magic!

Also, the Early Bird breakfast wrap is my GO TO for food. Everything they serve is yummy.

This particular location is family friendly and welcomes a great deal of natural light.
Don't forget your punch card!! (On this trip, I did... sad mikey)"}
{"text":"It's Tropical Smoothie, so the product is great and the prices are exactly what you expect.

Helpful, friendly staff too!
This location is set up kinda odd. This is not a lot of room to move around.
Also, they have signs prominently displayed to address their VIP Card and Military Discount programs... so DON'T F Around!!!"}
{"text":"Let's be serious... All Tropical Smoothie has to is keep the same products and be helpful to me... Keeping the store clean is good and I do like when they are appropriately staffed for a particularly busy time of day. Two locations around town even have employees who know my name and what I like.

So, why does this location always feel rushed and unfriendly?

Here was my Quick Tip on my last stop in:
\"Time to redeem a filled up card for a free Smoothies... Well, not \"free\"... She says \"that'll be 11 cents... For the Splenda.\"

To be clear, I showed her the punched card, she went to punch it again. When I showed her that it was completed, she implied that I was trying to trick her. She then said \"that will be 11 cents.\" I just looked at her inquisitively. She said \"For the Splenda, that'll be 11 cents\"

I ran out to the car to get 11 pennies.
What if I had been jogging?? 
What if I had 0 Dollars and 0 Cents and was hoping that a Tropical Smoothie, earned through my sustained, frequent visits, would cheer my broke ass up... NOPE."}
{"text":"Not sure why this location has such bad reviews... I never got stellar service, I mean its mostly teens working here so... Customer service isn't #1, but I get decent service, exactly what I rode and never have to wait too long.  Drive-thru is a plus!!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE ALL THE TIME !!! They are always understaffed, never open when they are suppose to, the staff is rude, always takes a ridiculous amount of time just to get a smoothie and even more time if you order food."}
{"text":"This location used to be a really good place. It had employees that were really friendly, and the smoothies were delicious. BUT..it seems lately that everything, including the employees, is going down hill. Always out of EVERYTHING, employees mumble instead of speaking clearly, and it's just not the same. Was there on 7/6/15, and ordered a Mocha Madness. I'm almost positive that they added in a COFFEE GROUNDS. Yes, so much coffee grounds that they got stuck in my teeth, and I was wired for hours. Not sure if that is healthy. The people that work here now don't know what they are doing. You would be better off going next door to Subway."}
{"text":"I ordered a half sandwich and a smoothie ... the smoothie was ok but the sandwich was bs !! They gave me a qt of a half sandwich"}
{"text":"Super busy and still great customer service. I would go here for smoothies if I were you!  They just earned my respect and my business. Lena helped us and she was awesome. And they were slammed! Good job"}
{"text":"was craving a smoothie recently and got a referral while over in Henderson to check out this place. headed on over and picked up 2 smoothies. a banana/strawberry smoothie and a muscle maker I think it was called. came out to like $15 with tip. 

walked next door to Wahoo to get a to go menu, that had me excited a tad. went back, picked up the drinks and left.

I did notice that while I waited for the smoothies, the restaurant decor is not that good. in fact if I recall the seats were ripped up with tape on them as a patch. the seating areas are just nasty and old. place for sure needs a remodel if they can swing it.

when got into car I started to get quench my thirst with the first smoothie, handed the 2nd one off to wifey...but there was just silence in the car as I drove off.

the smoothies are served in a 24oz (I think that's what the lady taking my order told me) cup. presentation is ok. it looks delicious through the lid, but once I tasted it, it was like slurping up nothing but crushed, pureed ice, a very faint flavor of strawberry and banana. same issue with the other drink. just minimal flavor of fruit.

on the way back to civilization I realized...I should've just got a couple of tacos at Wahoos' next door instead of wasting the money on the smoothie shop. I won't make that mistake again.

I went to smoothie king a few weeks ago, that place was delicious. so far, that is for sure first choice for a smoothie stop if near one."}
{"text":"Smoothies are good, services sucks ! Waited for 25 minutes just for my order, but everyone order after me had received their order and left ."}
{"text":"Couple visits. Staff has been pleasant and helpful. As a vegetarian, appreciate the fake-chicken options for the food. Place has been clean. Really can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"Worst serviced I ever had! Staff name Aylin was very rude! My order took over 30 minutes at drive thru. When I tried to talk to the staff she was so rude and shut the window on me. Can't believe it! Never going back again!"}
{"text":"The workers in this location keep your credit and debit  card info and use it later to make purchases for their friends and family, do not use your card here."}
{"text":"Im a regular at tropical smoothie I cannot believe how miss vonetta is so sarcastic and unprofessional....im in shock ....I thought I was being punked or something .....I will definitely let the owner know to get this sad excuse of a employee out of there store she is to worse....this was the second time I had to deal with her..... Unbelievable...I love this place but vonetta has to go and get some more training!!!! Seriously"}
{"text":"So far I'm waiting for my buffalo chicken wrap and it seems like this some kind of social hang out for employees and there friends this is the last time I will be coming here"}
{"text":"Had the Mediterranean Bowl and Paradise Point smoothie. Both were excellent. Nice little seating area, plus outdoor seating. Open 24 hours. The 2 people working now are very nice.
Definitely plan to return in the future."}
{"text":"This restaurant is unreal and the managers seem to not care because they do nothing about it. I don't even know where to start, how about with the poorly trained employees and lack of staff. I'm forced to come here cause there's not allot to eat in the area and I'm tired of the ridiculous wait for poorly prepared smoothies and food every single visit. This place is an all around joke"}
{"text":"The chicken Caesar wrap is good  and the smoothies are okay. They are very icey, rather than creamy, almost like a slushy. They have some tasty flavors but do not offer any size other than huge. I would prefer to pay less for a size I can actually finish. 

The thing that keeps me from going back to this location is the service. It is unprofessional and  extremely slow. The owner's son (I believe) is the worst. He is snarky and rude and talks/texts on his phone while handling food and smoothie ingredients. The workers often shoot the breeze with one another instead of serving customers. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Located off a Main Street (Eastern Ave) in a busy Plaza so easily accessible. Next door to a Roberto's and place that sells Mediterranean food among other restaurants so lots of pairing options. Friendly and quick staff. Noticed a lot of students and families come here so it seems this place is pretty neighborhood friendly. Drinks are on par."}
{"text":"I've tried several of the smoothies here and they're all pretty good. Blimey Limey and Sunrise Sunset are my favorite since I don't like banana. On my most recent visit I tried the Sunrise Salsa. It's a breakfast burrito with salsa. Not bad. In the past I've had some of the chicken wraps and they've been ok. They are fresh and better than any fast food sandwiches. Also it's open 24 hours."}
{"text":"People it's not rocket science.  Stuck in the drive thru for 20 minutes before any order taken.  Guy said the first car had a big smoothie order.  Well...tell the first car to park on the side like any other drive thru with big orders. People use your head.  You just wasted 20 minutes of my life.

Even McDonald's knows better."}
{"text":"This place is HORRIBLE, first off in a vegetarian I asked for super green Caesar wrap with veggie chicken. I also ordered a peanut butter paradise with no sugar added. Both were extremely wrong. My smoothie 100% had sugar in it and I know this for a fact because I've had this particular smoothie for the last seven years and The worst thing they did is give me REAL CHICKEN!!! Like wtf I had to say sub chicken for veggie chicken over 10 times then when I receive the rap I even said it then \"this is veggie chicken\" the woman said yes.  I took a bite and realized it was real chicken and spit it out. You need to hire Quality service. People who actually care about their jobs and not there just to make a dollar and not care about customer service."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this place was severely understaffed.  I was the second of 5 customers waiting for smoothies, and there was only one person running the register and making smoothies.  Took me 30 minutes to get my food and smoothie.  I feel bad for the three people behind me, and watching two people leave without even ordering, this place cannot last long if things don't significantly get better."}
{"text":"We love this place! My favorite is the avocolada. Definitely overpriced and they don't offer a smaller size option. But I keep going back because they have such good flavor."}
{"text":"I know this place has been on the down side lately but tonight I went to get a smoothie and some food and i left very happy. 

The guy who helped me tonight was David. He greeted me in a friendly manner through the intercom, and me being so indecisive took some time to order. He was very patient and listened. He told me he would tell me my total at the window. 

During this time 2 other cars were ahead of me. As slow as the line was moving( I'm pretty used to it. I've been to this location several times).. People seem to still come here. Positive sign I guess. 

Anyways as I reached the window, I only saw that one guy working, David. He was professional and had great customer service. My experience tonight was the best one I've had from this location in several months! 

So shout out to David for keeping this location on the plus side."}
{"text":"I don't like to give bad reviews but geez...they left me no choice. When I walked in there was zero people inside. A young, and very rude girl came the register. I said hello in a friendly tone and she just stared me. No response, no smile, not anything. I ordered the smoothie that saw on an add I had just received in the mail. She looked at me and said we don't have that. I handed her a coupon with the location of the store that sent it (this location) and she said \"oh well we don't have that, we will get it tomorrow or something\". Because I made the trip I ordered something else that I didn't really want...a taco. The girl barely utters the total, I hand her my card, she snatches it out oft hand, swipes it then hands it back. I said thank you and she said nothing and walked away. A different girl brought me food and she was very nice and that's the only reason I gave this place two stars. The lame that I had the problem with had short curly brown hair, wore glasses, and was extremely unpleasant. I will never go back!"}
{"text":"I get being busy, but there was only two customers ahead of me and the two girls working didn't greet me or engage in any conversation for what felt like forever. I just stood there. Awkwardly waiting for someone to say something to me like \"hi! I'll help you in just a moment\" then some girl came in and was doing something on the cash register, made eye contact with me, and still said nothing to me at all. No, \"thank you for your patience\" or \"have you been helped\" she just stared at me. When someone finally took my order it was as if I was an annoyance to them. 
What do you want
Okay here is your total
Walks away. No thank you for ordering or your order will be right up. Just absolutely not a single drop of customer service at all, no attempt even. It's obnoxious to me because it's so easy to just tell a customer you acknowledge they are there and you will get to them. If I didn't want my smoothie so badly I would have walked out for being ignored. If I annoy you with spending my money and keeping you employed, then I guess I'll go to a company that doesn't mind me buying their product."}
{"text":"One of the only healthy options in the area, but it comes with god-awful service.  It opened up a few months ago, and you think they would have their kinks worked out by now.

There is barely enough room to stand in line for ordering. During the lunch rush, this is a huge problem. You don't know who is in line where, and finding a place to stand while waiting for your food can be a hassle. Their salads and wraps are good, but take time to make. I waited almost 30 minutes for a salad once, making me late to work. Even then, the lady working behind the counter accidentally made it into a wrap, causing me to wait an extra 10 minutes. There's no reason simple food should take that long to make."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Thanks for wasting 15 mins of my life. Wasn't even acknowledged after she took the customer before me and completely left me at the counter for 10 mins."}
{"text":"It smelt super fresh and clean when we walked in and the associate took everyone's orders quickly with a smile and great attitude. There was a sense of urgency and care for each customer. Definitely my place to come!"}
{"text":"Thought i was going to get some smoothies and sandwiches but once again walked in and no one is in the store to serve us we stood for 15 min and nothing no one in the back of store or front. Go to leave and a young kid with blk tropical smoothie shirt comes in the door not saying a word to us and left his toyota running in the parking lot parked next to us. Shortly he comes out with smoothies and gets in his car and leaves!!! Bad customer service and not safe to leave a store open and unattended.. I will go to another location"}
{"text":"You are always out of hummus. Fix that problem because your hummus veggie wrap is pretty good and you've lost our business on many occasions. It makes me not want to even try coming back. I tried calling ahead of time to make sure you have hummus and your phone number is wrong. Get it together."}
{"text":"The owner needs to hire at least 2 people on for every shift, the location is 24/7 and always busy everytime I come in, especially on nights like this when they run a special! One employee can only do so much, and it's not right to have customers waiting as much as it is to have them gripe about employees due to it being understaffed! 

On a brighter note, Amanda is amazing, she always has a great attitude when my boyfriend or I come in to get our smoothies in the morning!"}
{"text":"This location is not the best. I prefer the locations without drive thru's, because they just don't seem staffed enough to do both. Also, I was told by someone I know who is an employee, that they are no longer doing punch cards. The drive through line is usually horrendously long, and even if it isn't I usually have a 15-20 minute wait. If you go inside, sometimes they will forget about your smoothie or food entirely. But, there's a 50/50 chance the drive through will only have a car or two and the wait isn't too long which is probably the only reason I haven't stopped coming entirely."}
{"text":"I work right next door and when I get a break I go get myself a smoothie they have a good variety of smoothies and other stuff like sandwiches. I've never ate here, just doesn't look like a food type of place. But the smoothies are fantastic the workers need to work on their verbal skills. They don't really know how to talk to people. But it's okay I'd rather have you not talk and make me a good smoothie or talk and make me a shitty one."}
{"text":"A simple, easy and healthy fix, but a franchise nonetheless. I've tried the Sunset Sunrise and the Strawberry Basil Lemonade smoothies along with the Korean BBQ Steak Taco and Bajo Taco. I'm a huge fan of smoothie king so any smoothie I try is up to major competition. I can't say that Tropical compares but it is definitely convenient as I do frequent Metropolitan. The Bajo Taco is my favorite! SO flavorful but a tad bit pricey for the size. On the other hand, the smoothies are reasonably priced (especially the specials they usually have up front)! Will definite be back when I'm in the area and in need of a smoothie fix!"}
{"text":"Read menu closely, they deceivingly add sugar to all their smoothies using clever words on the menu to disguise it : \"all 24 oz smoothies have turbinado added\" should read something like: \"Warning, we add sugar to all of our smoothies\" WTF people! Isn't fruit already supposed to be sweet enough? And forget about organic, the guy behind the counter didn't even know the difference between conventionally grown and organic. Avoid."}
{"text":"Drive through took a very long time.   When we finally received our order, the smoothies were made mostly of ice, my chicken bowl had no chicken in it, the fruit and chip sides were not in the bag at all.  They did however make the hummus wrap correctly.  1 out of 6 correct items equates to 1 star."}
{"text":"This is the second time here in 2 months and I remember why I haven't been back in awhile. Service is absolutely so so so molasses slow. The poor employee there is the only one working at 12:30 pm and has to take orders, not wash hands then makes smoothies and make the time between all that to make wraps and fill up her ice supply and fruit supply all by herself! Management should be ashamed for scheduling just her during peak hours and it was like this the last time too! If you want your smoothie in less then 20 min this NOT the place."}
{"text":"I've been going to this TSC since I moved to Central Phoenix two years ago. The service is usually spectacular and the smoothies are great. However, this morning before I could even decide what I wanted to order, I was turned away by a rude cashier on her phone. The sign on the door read \"exact change only\", so I went and pulled out some cash, assuming that like every store I've worked at, there is money in the till. When I walked up to the counter and began to order, she looked up from her phone and said \"exact change only\", and I asked if she could break a $20. She said no and returned to her text. So, I'm supposed to believe that if I don't have exactly $5.35 or however much a smoothie with tax costs, I can't order? That you don't have change in the till or refuse to do the math in your head or on a calculator? That you still can't take my card? That maybe I have the change in my pocket before you return to your text? I wish I got the girl's name, but I was too furious to look, and promptly left the establishment. This has been my go-to spot for years, but after this experience, I doubt I'll be going back. If I could give zero stars for this experience I would."}
{"text":"24hrs tropical smoothie. Wow! So I just stopped by with my boyfriend because I was craving a smoothie. It's very cute and bright inside with nice decor. It's about 10:30pm and there's quite a crowd (approx 15 people) but only one worker. I feel so bad because he's by himself and everything is taking a while to be made. Nonetheless, his service and attitude never went away. He kept a smile and kindness towards everyone who came in, and took his time with ease so everything was orderly and not sloppy. Great job to him, but I would consider at least one more person to help this poor man out!!"}
{"text":"Continually, over and over again, going thru this drive-thru takes forever! This time was the longest ever which is what lead me to place this review. 30 minutes after I place my order just to get to the window, and then still wait for my two smoothies to be made! How is this possible?! And not even a single, \"sorry for the wait!\""}
{"text":"This is in the food area of Green Valley Ranch Casino. open 24/7. The smoothies are very tastey and the girls working are nice."}
{"text":"Well as far as smoothies they actually make the best ones in my area however it's 6:04 am and i am waiting outside with someone else because nobody is inside. What sucks is i did a online order for ASAP now I'm forced to wait until someone comes.

So the girl walked in at 6:11 am ... i called corporate and the lady said because they are individually owned thet she couldn't refund my money... smh i will never use that app again and this location definitely lost a customer... someone should of been here at 5:30 to prep and open... this is food service not retail..."}
{"text":"Horrible service at this location. I went into the restaurant earlier to order a Roasted Red Pepper & Pesto Bowl and received half a bowl of spinach for $7. I get it. Sometimes restaurant workers get the order incorrect, but to \"forget\" to add seven of eight ingredients?! And then the employees acted as if I was interrupting their break when I went back in. I was the only customer there!! I don't recommend anyone visit this location."}
{"text":"I stopped in here because of.... the prices. I thought that under 5 bux for a smoothie was a great price. The smoothie itself was
fine, certainly worth the price. A chain is a chain, but the staff was certainly helpful and willing to please. 
 Typical shopping mall chain ambiance, but for the price, I will be back and search others in my travels."}
{"text":"It's seems to me the Management at this store is either non-existent or lacks education on how to run it and train people to do so when they are not there.  You stand a the register and look directly into the kitchen/prep area.  Always looks disorganized and the floor is never clean.  The wait times got so bad, not because they were busy, I started calling in my order.  I was put on hold and then forgotten.  Once I came into the store still on the phone and they did not even realize till I ask if someone was waiting on the phone.  Sorry to say this is close to my carpool but I am going to have to find another place for my smoothies.  Its sad this place could be soooo much better with the correct management."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place !
I go here almost every other day and order the Blimey Limey and they never seem to disappoint .
I would highly recommend friends to check this place out ."}
{"text":"Great smoothie! Delicious flare bread. The manager was efficient and didn't seem to care about me. I asked for a water cup after ordering a meal and drink and he never gave it to me. You can tell by his facial expressions that he doesn't like his job and is upset at everyone. Not impressed with the man with the beard at the cashiers desk."}
{"text":"I love tropical smoothie. ....but not all locations,  especially this one.  Drinks are great,  but service is horrible.  I don't have a half hour to wait for a drink when there's only 3 people ahead of me,  and that's what happens almost every time I go here.  And to make things worse, they've served people who come in after me all the time.  If there was a closer one to my house I'd  go there,  and while I don't like jamba as much,  I might start going there because this place is starting to suck more and more every visit."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever. No one is inside and its just me in the drive through.  Yes I'm sitting here writing this.  The 15 minutes.... for a wrap and a smoothie. . . Plus I had to repeat my order at drive through then 2 more times at the pay window. . . Uh helloooooo"}
{"text":"Second update:

5 stars! Intercom is fixed and I could clearly hear and understand everything and 0608 in the morning and they are up and running. Didn't ask for military discount and checked my check, sure enough, good to go. Great job to the owners and staff for taking care of the customer!  Just showing you care enough to try is more than most these days, great business!

Update: I wrote a review a few days ago about some issues I felt could improve at this location. I noticed that the business itself comments back on many of the Yelp reviews. Within a couple days, the business has already put plans in place to enhance the service at this location and that automatically bumps it up a star. Kudos to you for running a business you care about!  Heading over this morning hoping they are open.

Tropical smoothie is delicious and I will be a long-term customer.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"What happened to their amazing smoothie menu?  It was very limited today. Yuck...and the smell when you walked...was like burning rubber.  :-("}
{"text":"To start off , the smoothies here are good ! So I really want to give 5 stars, but let me tell you why I can't ... The short guy cashier(sorry I didn't get his name )  was extremely nice ! So Prices got raised a bit but no big deal, since minimum wage went up , so anyways , we always get food + smoothie , we ordered a health nut smoothie and another one , plus a chicken pesto with slaw and a chicken bacon ranch flat bread with an orange . So the food came out perfectly and so did the smoothies but the girl that made our flatbreads , delivered them and made a face and was so rude saying \"here , just to let you know we are closed \" so she clearly kicked us out without us even grabbing our food , she kept making faces at us because we were still sitting down. We felt so Unwelcome! We let the cashier know how we felt and he told us to stay and eat but we just felt like we were being watched by her making comments so we just left . I wish there was a manager there so I could of said how we felt .... I honestly hope she can put a smile on her face in the future and not be so rude to people! We love this place but are seriously doubting come back here , they just lost regulars , we usually come here a lot , but I refuse to feel under appreciated because we came in at a later time and she's unhappy !  Customer service is key and she needs an attitude change !"}
{"text":"Ordered a king Cesar wrap and my lettuce was old and rotten, and the chicken was hard. The employees never answer the phone, and are usually rude. The only reason I continue to buy from tropical smoothie is because of the smoothies."}
{"text":"Terrible food and service. Spent 25 minutes waiting for food and got yelled at by other customers for blocking the drive thru waiting for my food!  Sandwich wrong and brown lettuce and smoothly all chunky. Need help badly."}
{"text":"Literally 1 guy working, no manners, literally sighed when I ordered food. Will not visit in the future."}
{"text":"went here today with a friend to have him try a coffee smoothies I had at another location...  totally was excited to have him try it.... 

womp womp.

it was horrible.  you'd think everything would taste the same even if it was at a different location.  [it is a franchise]  the recipes are provided with the franchise usually.. and with specific instructions i assume?

yeah. no. 

it was watery and had no flavor!  I guess they just weren't into it yesterday? not into serving what their supposed to be serving?  get it together yo!  everything should be as expected! duh!"}
{"text":"I've always had a great experience here. The customer service is great.. I just wish I could leave a TIP on my CREDIT CARD! Not everyone carries cash and hour employees deserve tips!"}
{"text":"Went from good service to HORRIBLE service, not sure if it's under new management or what but the customer service sucks and they are always out of product or the ovens are down.   SMH"}
{"text":"This place is almost always under staffed.  Their workers are slow and inconsiderate towards customers who have short lunch breaks.  They offer a discount to local businesses,  but depending on your nationality they'll ask you for your SSN before they ask to confirm your work badge.  They treat some customers better than others.  Their manager often holds up the line by conversating with customers and spewing jokes rather then getting customers in and out. He's not very professional. They employ a satanist girl who I would never tick off,  because she works in the back on the food line. I once said \"God bless you all and have a good day\" I received the most devilish look from that satanists girl, and I'm not even religious.  I just said it out of good nature, naturally.  Let's talk about the products.  Are any of their fruits or vegetables organic?  No.(GMO's) Do they use high fructose corn syrup as an additive/filler? Not sure,  but Possible.  Their food is good but not filling and a little extreme as far as \"trying\" to be exotic.  I recommend One Stop nutrition which is located next door.  Better quality, better health.  We live in the age of information,  do your own research."}
{"text":"Smoothies were ok, kinda gritty not what I'm used to.  Two guys inside very busy they were giving their all, but couldn't keep up.  Drive through is cool haven't seen a smoothie drive through before."}
{"text":"Don't come if your in a any kind of a hurry... Very slow service & employees can't find things. Yelling behind counter at each other"}
{"text":"I love tropical smoothie but I don't get how this place is still open. The service is the worst I've ever seen. Waited 30 minutes at a drive thru for a smoothie and two wraps and only to find out they were not what I even ordered."}
{"text":"I've been to this location (W. Flamingo/Grand Canyon) three times in the past month. Every time, I've had to wait 15 minutes or more for one smoothie. Twice I went into the cafe and once I went through the drive-thru. 

When I tried the drive-thru, there were only 3 cars in line. Waited in line for 15 minutes, only to be told (when I got to the window) that they didn't get my order so I had to wait another 5 minutes as they made it. 

The last time I went in (on a Sunday afternoon), I waited almost 25 minutes for one smoothie!!! It looked like there was only one person working the register and the same person was making the smoothies. Right before I left, I saw 3 other employees pop up, but who knows what they were doing the whole time.

Won't go to this location ever again."}
{"text":"Pretty delicious smoothies, I love that you can customize them. There's so many options. The vibe was really chill. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Their smoothies are fantastic but they are never open when their hours say they are. I've gone four times and the doors have been locked during their hours of business. Today four people were waiting outside at 830 (they open at 7). The chairs were down and music was blasting but the doors were locked. I tried knocking and calling but no got no response. Everyone left and one of the other people waiting mentioned that this has happened to her multiple times as well. I did mention it to an employee before and she told me their opener had an emergency. I can understand it happening once but four times (within a month) is ridiculous. They don't even seem to care when you tell them and they don't bother apologizing for the inconvenience."}
{"text":"Not very fast service, but delicious smoothies! Yummy!

This place is always busy and I know why. First, super friendly staff and great smoothies. They could stand to be more efficient making the waits less, but it was worth it all in the end.

I got the Peanut Paradise with peanut butter, banana, non-fat yogurt and whey protein. It was a BIG drink. Almost too big. I was headed to yoga and just wanted a little something to put in my stomach, but I couldn't drink all this without getting sick, I'm sure. So, it's a good sized smoothie for the price. 

I have other things here that were just as good in terms of smoothies. I have to say the food looks a little unhealthy (not sure if is or isn't, just looks that way), but looking at it I'd have to stay away. 

Anyway, great place to indulge a little and do it in a mostly healthy way! Love this place!"}
{"text":"I wish they would get my smoothie orders right.  The Blimey Limey is not so limey without the lime, so please stop forgetting my lime.

Also, they are always out of ingredients.... maybe the ordering needs to be reassessed?"}
{"text":"Visit on 8/12/2017 - and the drive thru had 3 cars in line.  I waited.  The drive-thru wasn't moving.  I decided to park and stop burning my fuel.  Went inside - there was 1 customer ahead of me.  We stood at the counter and waited 5-10 minutes.  The guy ahead of me gave up and decided to leave.  When that happened, the employee with blond tips in his hair came to the counter.  I wanted the detox island green and my daughter wanted the sunrise - but they were out of bananas. This was on a Saturday afternoon.  Guy said that there was no management there - and they were out of bananas.  Now - most of the smoothies INCLUDE bananas which made today's visit a difficult one.  We eventually left but I probably won't visit this location again.  Tropical Smoothie might want to send a regional director out to visit this location just to make sure that the owner/manager are doing what they should be doing.  More than ridiculous."}
{"text":"Rude, unprofessional teenagers working not only on the register but also in th back ruined my experience. I was ignored completely ans my smoothie was just coldly slammed on the counter for me to grab. One girl even had her family inside being loud, obnoxious and annoying. It was also really dirty."}
{"text":"This place sucks! The owner is a retard for only scheduling one employee in a busy location."}
{"text":"I came here a few times after my workouts.. if you are a gym goer, or need to wake up for work then this is the best way to wake up and give your body pure and natural ingredients, as well as antioxidants that it needs for the day. And the smoothies really give you a boost after a work out or before or after work.. I recommend the island green smoothie and if you have your own smoothie cup, they will put in in that one for you. Kind of like Starbucks, it's. Nice tropical atmosphere and Everytime I have a smoothie from there I feel awake and refreshed."}
{"text":"Super slow service almost every time. Came in with no other customers in sight and took them at least 5 minutes to approach me at the counter and take my order then another 10 minutes to make my food. I ordered ONE wrap. Mind you there are TWO workers working and they continued to take their time talking before making my food. Disappointing... if a customer looks unhappy you would think to hurry up or do something different right?"}
{"text":"This Tropical is the worst of all. How is it possible every single time my absolutely the same Totally Green Smoothie to taste Totally F...n Different... One time is too sweet, even that i always order with no added sugar, one time is watery as hell, today i have it and it looks like its only crashed ice inside...This guys are horrendously unexperienced and i see new faces all the time... It is a part owner fault...who's gonna care for $8 an hour"}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times since it has been opened. Which I think has only been a few weeks. First visit, I was, sad the drive thru wasn't opened yet, so I was forced to go inside. The place was very clean! I came right before closing and no one seemed to have a problem with that, but then a rush came and only one girl new how to make smoothies out of the 3-4 workers. Staff needed to be trained a little more but I've seen much improvement since this first visit on the smoothie side. Smoothie was great. Ordered chicken Caesar wrap and that took forever. Anytime I have ordered food here it seems to take a long time. Today I ordered 3 smoothies and they came out lightning fast a delish! I know it's a chain, but I do kind of feel like it's just a hair pricey. But I'm glad there's a smoothie place up here now! And 24hr drive thru rocks. I do love the chicken Caesar wrap so I will attempt to order again and pray it doesn't take forever."}
{"text":"Good menu but the bread and wrap has a weird taste to it. I think it's the grill great service though"}
{"text":"Horrible drive thru that is supposed to be 24 hours, I go in the mornings to get a smoothie before work and no one is at the drive thru to get my order. Why advertise your 24 hour drive thru when no one is in there. The service is barely average when your in the drive thru anyways."}
{"text":"Horrible service!  Waited in drive thru for 20 min! The girl didn't acknowledge that I was waiting and I had to knock on the window to get her attention.   I asked for a refund and she had no clue what to do!"}
{"text":"Because there is no Jamba Juice around here, I've had to find another smoothie place. The smoothies here are so refreshing and I never feel that nasty sugar crash after. The smoothies aren't too thick but also aren't too watery. They have great blends of smoothies that, yes, are pricey but it's huge (24 oz). My favorites are the superfood smoothies and the supercharged smoothies. My friend substitutes mango for any added sugar, which I have now taken and do whenever I order my smoothies. It definitely adds the right amount of sweetness without added sugar, which makes me feel better about what I'm drinking. (Note: sometimes they'll charge extra for this.) They have great customer service and are usually quick with the orders. I've been in and out in less than 10 minutes for sure."}
{"text":"Workers are slow and usually not friendly. Prices are high.  Don't like that they expect me to tip on a smoothie that costs $5.49. Smoothies taste good usually."}
{"text":"Love the smoothies, hate the service. Every other time I visit this location, they seem to be understaffed. The wait is crazy for 1 smoothie especially through the drive thru. Depending who is there the service is below great."}
{"text":"I keep telling myself that I will never go to another branch of this franchise, and yet I did. My mistake. I blame myself. I never ever have a good experience at any of the locations I've been to. I truly believe there is something wrong with their training and business model.
Yes, we had a big order this time. 15 smoothies. I did expect a long wait. But I also expect a certain level of competence from their staff. They advertised a \"Buy two get one free\" special, but somehow they forgot about this and charged me for all 15 drinks. It was such a fiasco getting the difference refunded as well. After some long debate, the manager (who wasn't even onsite) finally approved a refund.
And after the long wait, (and to make a long, ridiculous story short), we ended up getting only 14 drinks. We counted everything in front of the person who took our order and they could not figure out which one was missing. At this point, we lost patience because we were there for over an hour so we just left.
I'll never ever make the mistake of going to this franchise ever again."}
{"text":"I like that it is 24 hrs. I outta 3 smoothies is good. Every time I have gone in you leave smelling like old fried grease... Or something. Can't pinpoint the smell. Its not clean at all. None of the containers on the counter with protein powder or oats have lids. Everything is always open. I keep thinking maybe next time will be better....... Nope. Problem is it is right by work, I'm so torn."}
{"text":"I come here because the food and smoothies are good and it's close to work. But every time I leave I always say I'm not coming back. I have once to be greeted or have somebody say we will be right with you, even after standing in line for 5 + minutes without being helped. The chubby balding guy is always there, with his usual I'm to cool to be here attitude and no smile 'what can I get you' greeting. My sandwich always has tomatoes even though I ask for no tomatoes every time. My guess is they don't read the reviews since this is the norm review for over a year. If they got it together I might come here more than once a month."}
{"text":"Came here around 12:30am, Thursday night and the employee working (pretty sure his name was Kimuel on the receipt) and I was so pleased with my experience! Reviews criticizing bad service are extremely common with 24/7 places but I was happy to find that Kimuel was the complete opposite of those reviews. He had great customer service, great communication, and was just an overall friendly person! He helped me on deciding my smoothie as I was very indecisive on what I was going to get and his service was extremely quick!"}
{"text":"I was given the wrong items.  When they finished making my smoothie and sandwich they didnt even say anything.  They just left it on the counter.  They didn't smile.  I had to go up there and ask if this was a Chipotle chicken wrap.  The girl had no clue.  I then asked another guy twice.  He said um.  Then he said yes.  

Well, it wasnt.

Employees don't smile.  My Muscle Builder smoothie was without protein.  

1 star."}
{"text":"My daughter loves this place mainly bcuz they have vegan chicken. But... they've been out of the vegan chicken for days! I went in today for her vegan chicken wrap & 3 smoothies & was told they still do not have any of the vegan chicken. The last time I called in to order was four days ago and they were out of it then! Don't they order things right away that they are out of? I had to wait 15 mins for the smoothies !!! There were 4 ppl working. There was only 1 person waiting ahead of me & about 5-6 after me. 15 mins for some smoothies is way too long to wait IMO! There's always a long wait here & the only reason I go is bcuz my daughters vegan & it's hard to find places that offer anything for vegans. They need to step it up or I won't be returning!"}
{"text":"Slowest new location EVER. Literally takes 15-20 minutes for drive-thru. although the quality of the smoothies and the sandwiches are still good it's kind of frustrating waiting that long even when there's no other cars in front of you. It's happened over 5x now"}
{"text":"When ones hunger is taking over them and driving around, we have a few choices here in Las Vegas. You can go through a drive through, or stop and get a quick take out fast food type item. Tropical Smoothie has a couple locations around the valley and they really serve a great purpose. They have good smoothies, although not my favorite thing there, and wraps and salads. The Chicken Ceaser Wrap is the absolute perfect lunch on the go. It is SO yummy. It has white meat chicken and lettuce and cheese inside a tortilla, with some baked chips is under ten bucks and a pretty healthy alternative to a drive through. Another fave of mine is the Buffalo chicken wrap, it beats a burger any day! They use boars head meats and cheeses for its sandwiches so your always guaranteed a great sammy!"}
{"text":"Came in around 8pm and the place looked like it was ran by animals. I could see where they dispense the fruit flavors for the smoothie and it just looked like it hasn't been cleaned all day. I don't normally do negative reviews but I thought I had to share my experience at this particular cafe. All the other ones that I been to were very well cleaned and Maintained. 

Anyways I waited a good 5 minutes until I could finally order and there was only one worker there so I understand. They should get more in there tho. One worker and it's on a busy street(eastern). 

It took about 20 minutes for my smoothie to finally get made. But the overall dirtiness of the place kind of killed my appetite for the drink so I just ended up throwing it away. Never going back to this location for sure."}
{"text":"Called four times to make an order through the phone and nobody answered. Why have a phone when none of your employees answer it?!?! 


Update: called several times today and still NO ANSWER.  Also when I went inside. It smelled like shit in there. Smelled like the bathroom hasn't been cleaned since George Bush was our president. Gross... almost threw up waiting for my smoothie."}
{"text":"Disappointed I stop this morning to try them out, but they were closed even though the door said open at 7AM at 7:20 they were not.... Off to Jamba Juice I go..."}
{"text":"Went here for the first (and last) time a few weeks ago while visiting Las Vegas. NEVER again.  Only one person working the counter at the noon hour, so very slow service.  Ordered the fish tacos, two for $4.99.  They have very nice pictures in the window and over the counter of good sized tacos filled to the brim.  My tacos were the smallest things you ever saw, about one bite for each taco, and that was mostly shell.  What a ripoff.  Not even that tasty either.  Don't get their food items if you go here.  I also saw them making up smoothies for other customers.  Looked like about 90% ice in each one.  Probably best to avoid them altogether.  And their corporate office isn't any better, as I contacted them and they never responded."}
{"text":"I came on 4/29/18. At 11:30am, the place was trashed. And no one was in line, and they ignored me for 20 minutes. Then a girl with dark hair & glasses came to the front and told us they dont serve food right now. This is a ridiculous policy. And this place stinks on every way possible. Go anywhere else but here."}
{"text":"It's so disappointing that when you are craving healthy, quick food on the go you have to wait 25 minutes. I KID YOU NOT. There was absolutely no one in front of me, and we weren't even sure if they were open because they had the drive thru sign turned off. The wrap is delicious but there is barely any filling. It's such a shame waiting that long for food and being disappointed yet again."}
{"text":"Almost every single time i come here, drive through or not no one seems to know what they are doing. I am currently in the drive through and have been for the last 25 minutes and when i get to the window they don't even know what i ordered. This is just ridiculous. Staff properly."}
{"text":"Waited in the drive thru for almost 10-15 minutes before getting a response. That response came when I gave up and started to drive around to go inside and get my drink. I sent my wife in to start the order and followed as soon as I could get out of the drive thru line. Walking in, I completely understood why the service was slow. One of the employees is just being really lazy. No urgency in making sure guests get serviced. No wonder this place is rated so low."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the customer service I received this morning from a girl named Mercedes. She was very condescending and down right rude. I get tropical smoothie every morning before work on the west side of town (where I typically am) and have NEVER had a bad experience until today. A tip to Mercedes: DO NOT be in customer service if you do not enjoy serving customers. Simple as that."}
{"text":"Just standing here... not being acknowledged, while one worker is stocking cups and acting like I'm not there and the other one seems to be in training. I would give 0 stars for customer service but I'm hoping the smoothie earns the 2 stars. Have SOME pride in working. Some people don't have even jobs."}
{"text":"Very slow. Ever time i go to this location i wait 15-20 minutes for a smoothie. They need to hire more help. 19 minutes today."}
{"text":"1 star for the service. It's beyond slow. It's probably because they only have like 3 employees working. And how come if I use a bogo coupon, you can't stamp my punch card? I still paid for one smoothie. Stupid. Also, if you order multiple items, they still only punch your card 1 time. So stingy. I go here a lot, because it's omw to work, but there is another location on flamingo that I will probably go to from now on."}
{"text":"This place is a joke and way under staff. Went through the drive through because I was in a rush and the lady asked me to pull up. Waited 5 mins still haven't gotten help. Parked and went inside there was only one other person inside waiting for her food and she was already in a bad mood because her food was taking so long. Waited another 10 mins someone pulled up the drive thru than, and instead of helping out the customer who got there first she helped the drive thru. All I can say is wow!"}
{"text":"This place is gross! Worst tropical smoothie in Vegas. The cashier, Brian(manager maybe?), is handling food and money without washing his hands and is running out if control."}
{"text":"The wait was soooo long!!!! The servers forgot our two shakes twice !!!!!  Never again"}
{"text":"Tropical smoothie has best smoothies in town but this location has the slowest drive thru on the planet I don't know if there is just never enough staff or they just don't care. The smoothies are great but I definitely recommend a different location if you are in a hurry !"}
{"text":"So we go to this tropical smoothie, we are waiting in line. Btw, no one greeted us or anyone that came after us. So we are waiting, there is a young man making making smoothies, a girl doing inventory, with a full place but at least she is working, and a guy at register who doesn't even make eye contact with the customer in front of him. We finally make it to the front of the line, he never once acknowledge us, never even looks up once, he just keeps jumping from register to register, never looks up once and then without excusing himself walks off to the back. Needless to say we left. Don't think they even noticed . Oh well, we went to Albertson's and bought some Naked Smoothies. Never going back. I'm in  customer service over 20 years . They need some training"}
{"text":"Waited 20 mins for 3 smoothie.. Two people working , but one decided to take a break while there's a long line .. Poor guy behind the counter seem like he's lost.. I will go to Jamba Juice next time.."}
{"text":"My review is to the owner - I waited in line for 30 mins because you had only one person doing all the work on 12/17/2015! That is no way to run a business! Will never come here again and don't recommend anyone else here either!"}
{"text":"The place itself isn't very clean & I had the impression this was a healthy spot..up until I saw them make a smoothie & pour in like 4 packets of sugar in it. NO THANK YOU! So make sure you request for no sugar to be added to your smoothies. 

I don't think I will be returning to this location but I am going to give Tropical Smoothie another chance and see how clean another location is. 

The big winner for me is that they give 50% off to Military, Police Officers & Fire Fighters. It's nice to see a business show some real support to those that keep us safe."}
{"text":"Note to management:hire additional staff! I had to wait 30 minutes for a smoothie and flatbread!! I mean, I'm all for waiting a bit longer for 'fresh food' but come on!! By the way..as I was waiting I went ahead and googled the nutrition facts for the smoothies ...71 grams of sugar in 1 smoothie!!! Really???? And like 599 calories! And that's for a fairly simple 3 fruit smoothies Oh that's the reason you guys don't post the calories on the board. I'm sure there are healthier ways of preparing these smoothies."}
{"text":"Smoothies are delicious, my personal favorite is the bahama mama. The location is not ideal and the service can be slow."}
{"text":"Mojito smoothie tastes like a warm location. The Caribbean breeze is fruity and zesty. 

I don't know about you, but I like to fight the chill with some coldness of my own. I love ice cream and milkshakes and smoothies on a cold wintery day. I don't know what it is, but I always crave an ice cold treat when I'm cold. 

Since I've had exams, I've been stopping in at the smoothie cafe to get dinner and a smoothie. I really like their toasted pita bread, which comes with a HUGE amount of chicken and a bag of chips, all for less than 5 dollars. The people who work there are pretty friendly. However, it is a little slow, but I mean, cooking takes TIME! They're toasting your pita and loading it up with all sorts of goodness. Sometimes you've got to wait a little for the magic to happen. I've never had a problem with waiting in line or not getting what I want here. 

The smoothies, if ordered with a meal, are only 3 dollars. Any smoothie. ANY. Even the specialty ones. I always get a smoothie with my meal. If you check out their options (there's a detailed menu on the table in front of the cashier), you can check out all the nutrition facts too! They have some super light choices and some heavier options too. I usually try to get one of their specials because, well, I always get caught up with big font."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I have been here but decided today and my experience today was way different than my past experiences. I had to wait about 15 minutes to order and while waiting the guy making the smoothie or girl in the back never greeted me or the guests as they walked in. They already had 4 people waiting but still greet guest and be friendly... nothing. As I was waiting some people who received their food brought it back because it was the wrong order. My buffalo chicken wrap was extra saucy and lean machine was very tart. Maybe I'll go back if theyor try the smoothie spot next to them next time."}
{"text":"Chicken and bacon flatbread was excellent. Raspberry lemonade smoothie was mostly ice and almost no flavor."}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant to visit, as I noticed the reviews were pretty terrible. I had a gift card, so I figured what could be the harm. I ordered a detox smoothie and the hummus wrap with apple kale salad. Everything was delicious! The employee working was very nice as well. Everything was prepared fresh and quick!"}
{"text":"Good plant based protein selection but not so good on the good side. It's more of an MRE than anything. The smoothies are good but kinda pricey"}
{"text":"Asked for chipotle chicken club got cali chicken or something like that . Asked for beach bum with white chocolate . First off chicken was hard as a rock took a bite thinking it was just the outside of the flatbread . Then took another bite and realized the chicken was hard as heck. My smoothie tasted so watered down. I called the store and asked for the manager some guy answered and then passed me to some girl named Jacklin, turns out she wasn't the manager but seemed like they tried to pretend she was because they were whispering on the phone but I couldnt hear. Went to the store didn't even get greeted when I walked in took about 5 mins to notice me . The girl jacklin went straight to the back to count out my refund AND THEN SHE CAME TO the front and just said it's exact change. The other employee supposedly named oscar ."}
{"text":"My office orders from tropical smoothie all the time, usually from a different location. We never have any problems at all. Today we decided to go to this location since it was on the way from where we were. We are not pleased with this one. The wraps had items on there that we specifically asked to not have on it. The smoothies were not blended so there was chunks of the protein and vitamin powder. It was not a good experience. Will be going to the other location from now on."}
{"text":"Stopped by while on a bike ride at 10pm. Needed something to drink and saw they were open (24 hours). Had a spinach smoothie (one with mango) and it hit the spot."}
{"text":"What's customer service?  been here multiple times for the food but for the attitude and treatment these drinks should be $1-2. Salina M specifically today 9/26/2017 11:21 AM blatantly sighed when I asked for a military discount. Severely poor attitude on her end and pretty much every employee that usually helps us. Wish the hiring managers or any supervisors would fix this but oh well- great smoothies bad customer service must be the tropical smoothie way."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place!! There is one girl that is always so nice when I come here. But I came in tonight to pick up an online order and the girl working was TERRIBLE. I walk in and there was only 1 customer in front of me. They had just finished paying and the worker taking orders was about to walk away and then stopped when she saw me coming in so she could take my order. As I approach the register the 1st worker was about to take my order and the other girl that is absolutely so rude tells the girl at the register to walk away and that I can wait and doesn't say anything to me. Then she finally comes to take my order after about 10 minutes and I simply say \"I am picking up an online order.\" She grabs my smoothie and hands it to me and I leave, and after I tasted the smoothie I could taste that there was no whey protein in it. So I took it back in and tell them there is no whey and ask if they can just blend it in instead of making a whole new smoothie. The 1st girl says yes that is fine and the rude girl takes the smoothie, throws it away, and says she already touched it. She then says we are out of whey is soy protein fine? Well, why didn't they say they were out of whey when they first gave me my smoothie instead of just making it without any protein and expecting me not to notice? Then the smoothie that I got with soy protein came out TERRIBLE. It was the worst smoothie I have ever had here. It is the girl with the blonde hair and wears a choker on her neck that works at the goodyear/avondale store that is absolutely THE WORST!!!! Never interact with her!!!"}
{"text":"I always love the food and the smoothies here, but the customer service is rarely good. I am used to indifference up to attitude. There are only one or two girls who work the register who are nice at all. I am happy when they are working. The rest of the time I just expect to be treated like shit or like I don't matter. If you have the time, I recommend the Durango and Warm Springs store. They're nicer."}
{"text":"Tropical smoothie is hands down my favorite place to grab lunch for healthy wraps and smoothies. A must try is the chicken cordon bleu wrap (which isn't even on the menu) and the Acai berry smoothie. The staff are always extremely friendly and the service is exceptional. Def check out tropical smoothie for the a healthy snack and the best smoothies in town."}
{"text":"Tropical Smoothie's new Citrus Cactus Smoothie is amazing  even after protein, chia, and everything else mock-up"}
{"text":"This place is good on the east coast. Was thirsty so...THIS PLACE SMELLS LIKE DUMPSTER JUICE!!! I declined the coupon for first time visit! Never again."}
{"text":"They are all so friendly!! I love the peanut butter smoothie a d it is AMAZING!!!! ALL of drinks are amazing and they use real fruit unlike jumbo juice. I love going to tropical smoothie!!!"}
{"text":"PERFECT DRIVE THRU for a date night if you want to spend quality time with someone you really enjoy. You will get to be trapped in an Indiana Jones maze-like drive thru for at least 25 minutes. 

If you are in a hurry, or even just expecting a reasonable 7 min wait, this is not for you. In your rear view mirror you will enviously gaze upon more fortunate smoothie enthusiasts who are still able to back their cars out of this death trap. 

I wouldn't immediately blame the friendly staff who seem to acknowledge that there is a significant wait. It is probably process, procedures, and bad planning that drive this inefficiency. 

I can't tell if it would be less of a wait to walk in? There used to be a drive thru tropical smoothie location across the street that NEVER required this much of a wait. This has happened on three separate occasions. This one prompted a review because on top of the wait, my order was wrong (just a sandwich and two smoothies) :( I hope it gets better."}
{"text":"Bought a 6 dollar smoothie and payed with a 20, but then the cashier walked away without giving me my change and when I brought it up she laughed and said sorry was trying to keep a tip, not to mention the bad smell that's roaming the room... Makes you not want to drink your smoothie"}
{"text":"Love this place , but they need to work on their drive-thru. They are extremely slow and the smoothies even taste rushed like they miss ingredients..."}
{"text":"This location has gone so downhill in the last year. I have the app on my phone which made it easy to keep going but after the first of the year they took away the half sandwich/half smoothie offer and the cost for a sandwich and smoothie is now $15 which is beyond crazy!  They are always running out of ingredients like ginger ect.. ( had a ginger glow with no ginger).  The staff is great but I won't be going back. The one on Charleston still offers the combo but its a drive for me.  I probably will delete the app."}
{"text":"Ordered online, pretty accurate timing. Saw the guy in the back making our smoothies and he was quick! But unfortunately the girl at the register did not acknowledge me. Smoothies were tasty"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for months because of its convenient location and almost everytime something was either messed up and done terribly. But every single time the establishment was very unclean. And almost half the time that I go the employee that's working alone has a bad attitude and doesn't look very hygienic. Makes me wonder if managers there don't really care to have a successful shop. I hope they take it more seriously soon, because if not they're going to lose a customer. And I sure hope when they cook food that the employees use gloves."}
{"text":"We order from this location all the time because we love the avocolada smoothie, we order the same thing every time and in 2 years they have gotten it right ONCE! Unbelievable! I'm certain every one there cannot read and take direction! You'll have better quality service from McDonalds than this location!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure who the owner is but he seems like he's cheap and does not care.  I say this because every time I Try to get a smoothie, there is One lone person working; that means trying to help people at the counter at the drive thru And the kitchen.  Every time I end up driving to the Tropical on Craig because they have more than One person working. I feel so sorry for what skeleton crew employees this place has.  They are always very nice and apologetic but they look so stressed out because they are By Themselves.  What type of owner does this???? It's Summer time; this is when this type of place makes their money; Hire some More people; they can't even stay open to 2am because the so called owner can't get anyone to staff this place; national level needs to be called on this store; it's dangerous to have only one person manning Any business at Any time.  Just have to keep driving to Craig store for my smoothies."}
{"text":"The gal with the purple hair and glasses is always so nice. However, this place never has enough ingredients, they usually don't put in the right ingredients in the sandwiches and wraps and they are so slow! 
I don't know how this place is still in business.  This was my 3rd visit with the pre order in the app and I come to the store to realize that they are out of hummus, but they charge me regardless.  The manager EJ is on the phone with the worker and says for me to go to his store on Trop and 215, he said the order (which is big,) will be ready by the time I get there. 
I get there and the girl at that store looks at me and says they will start on it, since she just got off break. 
Oh my goodness!! Why do they take so long!? They're smoothies!!! I make filipino entrees in a shorter time than this!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab some quick, fresh food! I love the açaí smoothie, the chicken pesto flatbread, and the California Baja rice bowl - it's very spicy and they tend to put a lot more lettuce than rice! Overall, great food!"}
{"text":"I used to come here a few years back and the smoothies were great, but tonight I got terrible smoothies I can tell he rushed through it because it was 20 minutes to close. They were so bland, and I'm upset I even spent money on this."}
{"text":"Long ass wait times in drive thru. Every time I come here. This is so ridiculous. I love their food, but this needs to be addressed."}
{"text":"If you like rude service,  under cooked pizza in bowls and uncut then this is the place for you. Not worth the space it leases."}
{"text":"These workers are sooooo slow, it shouldn't take 12 minutes to get 1 smoothie when you are the only customer in the store. They are inconsistent  with the way the smoothies taste or how they blended. I have worked in the restaurant/food industry and in customer service, so I get having off days, but this is repeatedly the experience here. Time to hit Jamba Juice instead. The management and workers need to step up their game here."}
{"text":"So irritated!! I go here quite often because I work close by. I spend Enough for a free smoothie once a month. So on their reward plan you MUST spend $55 or more. Today I ordered my regular Chicken salad sandwich. Needless to say NO CHICKEN?? When I called to ask why,  she stated \"we make it every 3 days you got the end of it\".  When I stated I should have been told and that they need to refund or credit me the employee HUNG UP on me! 
DO NOT GO TO THIS ONE! I have given benefit of doubt but place is still the same, dirty, slow and always employees who's hair and cleanliness should be questioned! Yuk!!"}
{"text":"Today I was in line for 20 minutes one smoothie. Get to the window.  What was your order? 
Wasn't even made

Very disappointing drive off"}
{"text":"Not the greatest area... I had some random girl who looked like she was on some type/s of drug/s and stood right next to me asking for money when I was trying to get in my car. I felt very unsafe . I told her no, got into my car and locked the door immediately. She then stood behind my car for a good 5 mins for some odd reason(making it impossible for me to pull out of my parking spot) 

As far as staff members go, they were all very friendly and fairly quick."}
{"text":"when you first walk in you are hit with this horrible smell of....i dont even know what it is.....its just nasty...like burning rubber or something! for being a place that is supposed to create amazing FRESH drinks from wonderful fresh fruit.......it certainly doesn't smell that way! Also, their sandwich/wrap selections for non meat eaters is sad! The one wrap that they have that is vegetarian is just nasty...whatever corporate chef put those flavors together clearly didn't taste it after they made it! one choice?? that's all your going to give us vegetarians??? I know thats more of a corporate issue...but the smelliness of this location should be the managers issue...also the employees are very slow and really dont seem to give a hoot about their jobs...."}
{"text":"This place is very dirty, noticed the c raiting that they got posted on the wall. Almost sorry I came in for a smoothie. 

The smoothie was decent don't think I'm going to come back here again."}
{"text":"I use to love this place so much but idk if they switch owners or whatever but it's horrible now. The drinks takes forever to make! For that price I rather go to Jamba Juice for better quality. They take forever to make the drinks and most of the time the drink comes out all gross and too much ice was blended in it. 

The most disgusting part is I was standing right in the front when one the girl was making my drink and then dip her finger in the smoothie and stir it around on top trying to remove the smoothie that was spilling over. 

Immediately I threw my drink out didn't even bother waiting for another drink cause seriously they take FOREVER to make one drink. I can't imagine them making two drinks and waiting for that.."}
{"text":"I really like this location because it's fast and staff is friendly. I stopped going to the one on 215 and Cheyenne because the staff is horrible. Every time I went they were always out of stuff and slow. This location the staff is always friendly and quick. I have  also enjoyed my smoothies and sandwiches."}
{"text":"I am actually surprised I am giving this location 4 stars. I have not been at this location for months because the customer service was horrible and was always out of items. This visit I was pleasantly surprised they finally fixed the signs where you order. Also the two guys working there were really nice and had my order out quickly. The smoothie and sandwich was good. I am glad they made some changes."}
{"text":"Can you say amazing?! The staff is friendly and this location has never been too busy when I have gone in so the service is also pretty quick. The food is wonderful. I haven't had anything that I didn't like. And the smoothies... SO good. Get a stamp/punch card too so you can get a smoothie for a penny later on!"}
{"text":"I'm concerned today that the bathroom has no soap for the men and a gentleman is making my food. Did he walk out of the bathroom without washing hands like me.   Yep he just walked out no soap. To bad I ordered food. Never coming back.."}
{"text":"I love Tropical Smoothie.  I always stop in when I'm nearby!  My favorite has to be the Peanut Paradise. It has peanut butter, banana, yogurt and a mix in.  I'm not a fan of certain fruits in a smoothie so this one is perfect for me!  If I stop in during the morning it usually keeps me going throughout till lunchtime, and it's also the perfect desert!"}
{"text":"After receiving some material in the mail about Tropical Smoothie Cafe, we decided to order lunch for our entire staff today.  The ordering process was smooth and painless even though we had a large and somewhat complicated order.  Arrived at designated pickup time and order was ready and waiting for me.  Our entire team enjoyed the variety of their wraps and sandwiches.  Will definitely go back to try the smoothies!"}
{"text":"Terrible. Slowest service EVER!! Coming from Florida all tropical smoothies are fast and super nice. IVE YET TO FIND THAT IN VEGAS!! This location being one of the worst and slowest. More staff maybe? Something has to be changed. I'll probably never be back so make that to locations in Vegas I'll never be back to. Soon I'll just give up on the entire company.. typing this as I'm sitting in the drive thru for a simple smoothie.... been here about 25 mins now. HELLLLOOOO CORP.. just shut down if your in the weeds and can not afford employees... oh finally at the window, my cashier was great. Older black male! Give these people some more hands to deliver great service!!!"}
{"text":"Worst location there is. Super rude staff!! And smoothies take FOREVER to come out. I'm the only person in here right now and I've been waiting 15 minutes and counting. Took over 5 minutes to even get greeted and helped! If I could give negative stars I would."}
{"text":"Soon happy about this location and the fact that it has a drive thru. The staff here is always nice and helpful. I will say the service is a bit slower than I would like which is why I am deducting a star. I would say that when I went to search on google maps for a tropical smoothie the closest one it wanted to take me to was the Craig location, it doesn't show a Simmons location at all, and my husband told me about this one which was right down the street, and the signage is very small, they should get some wave banners or do something because more people driving by would probably stop and they would possibly get more business. They could probably use it according to these reviews! I go here often and get our usual drinks, which is about 3 and we have never had a problem and we usually have the same guy there, the only thing I would say like most is the slower than usual service. I think 1 time we had to wait a good 14 minutes for 3 smoothies with 3 cars behind us and that wasn't good, but the drinks were great and correct. I haven't actually been inside this location yet, so I don't know how that is yet."}
{"text":"I normally wouldn't post a review like this, but this is the second time in the same week I am dissatisfied with the service I received at this location.
First time I came was on Monday or Tuesday, and there was a young man working alone. It was pretty busy, but wouldn't have been so bad had there been another employee. I placed my order and waited a good amount of time before my food came out (Smoothies came first like normal). I'm glad I decided to eat in house because when I unwrapped my food I noticed beans and corn on my king Caesar wrap. It seemed he had combined the hummus and Caesar wraps. I pointed it out to him and he immediately fixed his mistake. His attitude and demeanor are the only reason I bumped this up to two stars. He brought the wrap to my table and apologized again. However, both wraps that were made, were drenched in sauce. We had squeezed excess sauce out of the wraps multiple times, it was just too much.
Today, Sunday, is the second time I've been in this location. The food took exceptionally long, despite only one pair of people in front of us, who had already ordered by the time we entered, and three employees working. After we sat down we noticed the Sunday free supplement offer, but there was no one at the counter to ask if we could add it, so we dropped it. One employee began stocking the chips and pushing all the old bags behind the fresh ones. By then a few new customers has come in and the same lady who took our order, very pleasantly offered the free supplement to those customers. The lady who brought our food to the counter, called out the wraps and walked away by the time I got to the counter, I didn't even get a chance to thank her. The third girl who was bringing the drinks to the counter had done the same thing to every other guest, called the order and walked away. A couple ladies had even picked up each other's drinks and complained of being confused because it wasn't what they had ordered. The employee taking the orders had to ask what the drink employee had put in them to straighten everything out. Our wraps were not cut, so I walked back to ask, and they were happy to cut them. All in all the attitude of the employees really left me disappointed in this tropical smoothie location."}
{"text":"Oof. Should have looked at the reviews before going here. Two people working, one other customer, 15min wait for a \"quesadilla\". Charged for two when I ordered one. Kids wouldn't eat it because, well, see pics. No toilet paper in the restroom. Definite fail on my part for picking this place as a quick stop for lunch and potty between soccer games."}
{"text":"This particular location seems to be more miss than hit.  It always takes awhile to receive orders when I've been to others and they seem much faster - as well as much nicer.  The employees at this location just don't seem to like anything they do.

Quality is average - again, other locations just seem to have their S together.  I just happen to go to this one because it's close to the job.

Coworker and I went one time and her drink came out with a crushed-in lid, causing it to spill when she grabbed it.  The people in the back were too concerned with other things when she requested TWICE to get something to assist in cleaning up.  Kind of rude.

Lots of other places around the job that are closer and have the same type of food, but cheaper PLUS done right, so I probably won't return."}
{"text":"This used to be the best TS in Henderson. Not sure what happened. Took 20+ mins to get my smoothie and All American...which was cold had NO EGGS nor tomato like I paid for. 3 employees were laughing and joking around while I waited for my food. I was the only customer there. And the store was filthy. Very sad."}
{"text":"Not really good at lunch time hrs. I think the rush causes them to make careless mistakes on orders. I ordered a sandwich and smoothie. Smoothie was okay but they messed up my sandwich twice. I was on my lunch break and it took my whole break  to finally receive my sandwich. Once returning back to work with my food I then discovered they put tomatoes on my sandwich after me telling them no tomatoes. I'm allergic. So now, can't eat my sandwich and no time get another lunch. I love tropical smoothie but maybe only use this location during non-busy hours."}
{"text":"Went there today to grab a quick smoothie for myself & my kids. Arrived at 10:08AM. (Yes, I checked) Two people in line in front of me. Finally got our smoothies at 10:42, and one of them wasn't even the right thing. When I pointed it out, she gave me a dirty, pissed off look. I gave them 2 stars because the smoothies at least tasted good."}
{"text":"First time here. Not very impressed. Smoothies are decent but the staff and customer service could use a lot of help. Not including the curse words being spoken when I'm there with a 4 year old kid. Grabbed my drink and went next door to subway to drink our smoothie. Staff clearly didn't want to be there."}
{"text":"Wont last at this location. They don't open early enough. Customer service sucks. And the marketing is horrible. Good luck though!"}
{"text":"I am a huge Tropical Smoothie fan!  We had them out east and when we moved here we were so happy to find that there was one, just down the road.  I love that they have happy hour with buy one get one free!  I haven't seen that at any other Tropical Smoothie Cafe's that I have been to.  Every time I go I get the Sunrise Sunset, it is so refreshing!  When I get food I opt for the hummus veggie wrap, I am vegetarian and it is AMAZING.  They have a drive-thru which is super convenient.  If you are thinking about trying it, do it!"}
{"text":"First of all, turn on the air conditioning in the front. That's probably why the girls that work here are miserable. Anyways my aunt and I came here because she had never eaten at a tropical smoothie. After spending $39 we informed the person now manning the register that one wrap was buffalo chicken and one was a king Cesar. And they had 2 Buffalos down. The owner threw a fit \"I already made it \" yada yada. She was so rude walking away as we tried to tell her what the order should be. I was really embarrassed for my aunt after telling her to try this place, this is by far the worst owned tropical smoothie there is. We will continue to drive to the farther location on Ann for our orders."}
{"text":"I love Tropical Smoothie Cafe. Good food, great smoothies that aren't watery like Jamba Juice. But this location is terrible.

I was glad something opened up on the east side that is somewhat on my way to work (catching the 95). But the drivethru window is painfully slow. Even when ordering just a smoothie and I'm the only one there, its so sloooow. 

I usually only go to TSC when I get text alert about a special discount or free smoothie. Any time I come to this location they are almost always caught off guard by the promotion. There have been times when I've ordered food off the menu and the person taking my order wasn't even aware it was on the menu.

Today I got one of the new \"savory island club\" with kale and apple slaw, sounds awesome right? It was toasted to rock hard status. I couldn't even finish it, I was afraid I'd shred by gums. 

I hope this location gets better and doesn't close, east side needs more healthy food choices. But this location really needs to step it up. I will happily update my review when they do."}
{"text":"Food is good but he service is horrible.  There just aren't enough employees staffing this location. The line is always out the door.  It shows poor management to be that oblivious to your business needs.  Every time I'm there at least 3-4 people leave, so they are only hurting themselves.  


Update:  worst service I've ever had in Las Vegas. At any restaurant. Ever. We just waited 45 minutes. Only ones in the restaurant. Two quesadillas.  Never ever ever go here. Trust the reviews. Service is awful. Management doesn't care."}
{"text":"This is My Spot come here like 3 times a week no joke love the smoothies almost tried all of them and don't have one I don't like!"}
{"text":"Nasty attitudes. Smelled like they burned something. People came in to pick up online orders and had to wait 15 minutes so what was the pint of ordering online. Cashier counted tip jar twice in front of us. Smoothies were good, but I'll go to a different one."}
{"text":"This is my second review of this place and again this location is the worst out of all of them. First off after waiting 20-25 minutes in the drive through I get my three smoothies and then drive 15 minutes home to find all three taste horrible and that they didn't add the sweetener and flavor I ordered. I drove back and told the cashier and his response was \"I didn't make them\". I don't care who made it just fix the problem. 

When will I learn to never go to this location. Maybe this is the last straw. Tropical Smoothie Grand Canyon you suck!!!"}
{"text":"This by far the worst Tropical Smoothie cafe My wife and I have ever been in. There is no customer service. Blonde girl with a tattoo on her hand took our order, she has the personality of a rock. We sat down and waited at a table, it was so sticky, our whole experience was unpleasant. Do yourself a favor choose a different topical smoothie café."}
{"text":"Their drive is the worst. It takes anywhere 20 to half an hour. The don't even say sorry for the delay not thank you. This is the last time I'm coming to this location. After waiting in the drive trough 30 min I picked up my order which l I was missing my side orders.  Don't get fool again in going to this place. Tropical smoothly you get big fat F."}
{"text":"I am an extremely upset customer, I spend at the LEAST 50$ a week at this store! Today I ordered with I order every single day, an avocadolado and a Cali chicken club, they never get my order wrong so I didn't think to check the bag before I left. The Asian man who I am guessing is the manager, called out my name, \"ARI!\" There was only 2 other people in the store, pretty sure I'm the only Ari in the building! I grabbed the bad, said thank you and continued on my way to work, half way to the strip where I work I realized as I looked into the bad to grab my chips that there was a burrito, not a sandwich that I ordered. I called the store to ask if I can come get my sandwich or money back tomorrow since I'm 5 minutes away from work at this point and don't have time to turn around. The girl on the phone tried to tell me I grabbed the wrong bag!!! She blamed it on me!! The man called my name!!! It had my chips in it!!! Unbelievable! Then proceeded to tell me that he said I must keep the burrito and bring it in tomorrow! He expects me to keep a burrito in my hot car alllllllll day while I'm at work, or he wants me to carry it around with me at work? To prove that he gave me the wrong bag!!! I told the Girl on the phone that I am a loyal customer who has never had any issues and for him to expect me to carry around a burrito or leave it in my hot car and smell it up is fucking ridiculous and that I will be In tomorrow, and I better get my money back!!!! I also called Corperate. What a joke. Also I might add that while I was walking out there was a man arguing with him about wanting spinach in something, and I could hear the customer saying to him, \"yeah I wanted spinach that's what I ordered!\" Obviously this man has no sense of customer service and stop being a cheap ass and give his customers what the order and PAY FOR!! Also he should admit that obviously he shouldn't be making the food if he can't get the damn order right!"}
{"text":"Inconsistent. Smoothies taste good one visit then not good the next. Always seems to be understaffed, makes the wait longer. Just not a pleasant environment. Always a different person taking orders so turnover must be high."}
{"text":"I'm updating this review because the supervisor at the store remembered me and my mom and greeted us with a smile! It warms my heart that she took the time to make our drinks/greeted us personally at the drive-thru! I'm not sure what her name is, but she is has dreads! Thank you so much!"}
{"text":"I love Tropical Smoothie but this location is HORRIBLE. First the customer service is a ZERO. Second the place is always dirty. Looks like Jamba Juice will be getting all my business. This Tropical Smoothie has to be the worst one in the entire franchise."}
{"text":"My husband and I's new favorite restaurant!! Great customer service and even better food! All of their flatbreads are amazing and the mocha madness is my favorite so far (a must for coffee lovers)!"}
{"text":"Smoothies are good here. I always get the island green, triple berry oat or peaches n silk. However, their salads here are yuck. The Thai chicken salad is just lettuce with spicy salad dressing and maybe 2-4 pieces of chicken. There is also some sort of inconsistency with tropical smoothie chains. The one at santan mall is a little better. The food isn't as bad."}
{"text":"I tried to call in my order and the line was busy. I called again 15 minutes later and the line was still busy so I went to the location to place an order. I walked in and waited several minutes. There was no one to greet us or let us know to wait for service. I could hear a man in the back room talking and laughing on the phone. I yelled out to see if he could assist me but I was not acknowledged After a few minutes I left."}
{"text":"Use to love this place, but since this particular location has gone to twenty four hours, they've really let the quality go. The workers don't really acknowledge you when you come in, you can be standing at the counter for a minute or two before capturing an employees attention, usually because they are complaining about management, gossiping, or texting, the smoothies are super watered down and flavorless, and the wait takes forever no matter how slow they are. Really disappointed, this place used to be my favorite. And I hate that all these teenage employees are just perpetuating the stereotype that young people are incompetent, because they truly truly are here."}
{"text":"I've never been a smoothie person, opting instead for \"real\" food over liquid.  However, it's stupid hot in Sin City and the fastest way I know to cool down is to ingest something icy cold.  Since this Tropical Smoothie Cafe is mere minutes away from home, that's where I headed.  I chose the Acai Berry smoothie -- lots of happy antioxidants -- and sucked back as much of it as I could before my brain froze.  Locating shave ice trucks may be a bit more work in the heat, so I'm glad I can refresh myself with a smoothie.  :)"}
{"text":"Went there a few hours ago. Huge space. The kids that were working there earlier today were really cool and nice. Bought smoothies for my friends and I. They said theirs were delicious, mine however (Beach Bum w/ dark choc) was watered down or something. Barely any flavor. 

Best location I've come across so far is NW corner of Cheyenne and Buffalo. Usually always awesome service, and great flavor."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for a really long time and I know it well. 
Unfortunately, I've watched the prices go up from $4.99 to now, as of December 2017, to $6+ for one smoothie. 
I have never had an issue with this place until just recently in which I found plastic inside of my smoothie. 
I give this location 3 stars because granted I have only had one issue in all my years coming here. 
This Tropical Smoothie really needs to get it together and get back on top."}
{"text":"Been coming to this location for years. EXTREMELY friendly employees who always have such a great attitude, at least from my experience. The food and smoothies are always up to high standards. Always kept very clean inside and I've never had a single issue here. One of the best locations, for sure."}
{"text":"I drove 15 minutes to get a smoothie for my friends birthday. And she had huge chunks of ice in her smoothie. I called the place and the lady didn't do anything for me. This is Rediculous!!!!"}
{"text":"The staff isn't as friendly as they used to be. I've come here for about 6 years: was gone for a year after moving out of state and decided to visit because I've always loved this location and the staff here. 

I came to pickup an online order and was ignored for ten minutes. I was standing where I remembered the Pick Up counter to be located. I even saw my order sitting on the counter waiting for me. It was a little bit busy but not overly busy. I did the online order in an effort to not have to be away from the office for an extended period of time. 

Maddison, the girl who finally helped me when I walked up to the ORDER counter, was a bit rude. 

I had stood where I knew the Pick Up counter to be (again, long time customer who'd been gone for a year). She kept side-eyeing me from time to time as she would go from register to food prep area, but she never made eye contact nor did she greet me. Finally I went to the order counter and I said \"I am here to pick up an online order.\" 

\"Well how am I supposed to know that?\" 

\"I was at the pick up counter...\" 

\"THIS is the pickup counter.\"

\"Then why were other orders being given to customers from there? Also, that's where I've always gotten my order from.\"

\"Oh....well, what's your name. I don't know your name so how could I know you are here to pickup.\" (Insert aggravated attitude voice.)

\"My name is Angela: also if you see someone standing looking lost for a few minutes, maybe you should ASK them if you can help them. What's YOUR name?\"

She told me her name, changed her tone a LITTLE, and grabbed my order, which unfortunately was lukewarm at this point. I couldn't stick around and wait for a new order to be made. 

No more visits to this location I guess."}
{"text":"The new Watermelon Mojito smoothie is TO DIE FOR!! My boyfriend, family and I have never come to Tropical Smoothie as much as now since they've released that smoothie! You can really taste the watermelon in this smoothie, which is special because watermelon is not usually a very noticeable flavor. The mint is a vibrant contrast to the fresh watermelon and the sweet, tangy strawberry. The PERFECT treat after a long day, to cheer you up, or even a celebration. PLEASE, Tropical Smoothie, keep this smoothie!!!!! A+!"}
{"text":"Well, I did come back a few times since my last review despite my first visit. I can honestly say the service is getting better and better each and every time, especially my most recent visit! 

I was so excited when I found out they started selling Beyond Meat! This meat substitute is the greatest. I got the pesto \"chicken\" flatbread and a smoothie, both of which I loved! The girl working (still only one employee...) was so so nice, polite, and relatively quick! I was so impressed by her customer service and her speed. I think what really allowed me to be open to another experience at Tropical Smoothie Cafe was the friendliness and deliciousness of their catering which I had encountered outside of the store. I was hesitant to try it again, but I was definitely impressed! I will likely continue my visits to this location!"}
{"text":"I had a really tasty Mongolian beef bowl here.  It is only available for a limited time so bummed about that.  Hubby stopped a couple of days later and got me a sandwich.  It was very mediocre and I would rather stop at the nearby Subway for a sandwich.  When I went only one woman was working and while she was busy cooking customers got tired of waiting to order and left.  They need to get better staffed quickly or many irritated customers will never come back."}
{"text":"Giving a 2 because I like the smoothies but I really do not like this location.  Therr are several employees here that ALWAYS forget to make my smoothie with Splenda.  

Today was a twofer.  I just stopped in for their buy 2 get 1 free promotion between 5 and 7.  Ordered and she totals me for the full price on 3.  I hand her my card while I say \"isn't it buy 2 get 1 free right now\" and she runs my card while looking for her phone to check the time.  Then says well I already ran it so I can't do anything about it.  How about a card or something for the free one to be used at a later time?  Nope can't do that.  Asked for a manager, no, she only works in the morning.  then I told her she needed to call the manager because this wasn't happening.  She gave me a free fourth smoothie...gee Thanks. And guess what?  Definitely not made with Splenda."}
{"text":"You get an entire breakfast in a cup for the price of a burger, it's awesome. All natural, away from the fast food culture, FAT FREE. Food in there makes you feel good about yourself and what you put inside your tummy. 
Keep it up Tropical S."}
{"text":"Finally a smoothie spot in my neck of the woods.  I try to get over here a few times a week when I'm not making my own.  I've always been a fan of the island green which they offer with or without turbinado.  Lately, I've been getting the Chia Banana boost and I am really loving that.  On Tuesday's they have a special with any smoothie and a sandwich for $7.  I tried the Chicken pesto which was just ok, so I think I will stick to the smoothies for now.  The app is great when it's actually working, this location seems to always have an issue with app orders but I've never had an issue with other locations."}
{"text":"Waited a few minutes at the counter until an employee slowly walked up and asked for our order. We get the half chicken salad and smoothie to go. When we got home the sandwich was missing tomato, and had the tiniest amount of chicken salad! Guess that's what happens when there's no management and the store is run by teenagers... Will post photos"}
{"text":"When I'm sick and unable to eat anything except out of a straw, it's smoothie time. This location has a 24-hour drive thru, which I find interesting.  The drive thru takes a while, though, even if you are the only person in it.

I got the peanut butter cup smoothie, one of their indulgent smoothies, because it was the only thing that sounded good.  It's chocolate, banana, and peanut butter.  The flavors didn't really meld together for some reason.  I would get a mouthful of banana, then a mouthful of peanut butter.  Didn't taste much chocolate, even though it was the dominant color.  And there was no way I could finish it all.  Their smoothies are huge.

Anyway, good in a pinch and may satisfy those late night smoothie cravings, for those who have them.  Between 4-7pm, if you buy 2 smoothies, you can get a 3rd free... at this location only."}
{"text":"This place used to be great with service and food. Worst experience today. Ordered Ultimate club, no greens. Got this instead. Also was handed two small smoothie drinks instead of a regular smoothie. No chips either. Keep in mind it wasn't buzy either."}
{"text":"I come here a lot for smoothies, but have never tried the food here, so we decided today was the day that we'd try one of their wraps...boy what a mistake that was. I ordered 2 smoothies and a Jamaican jerk wrap. The smoothies came out about 5 min after I ordered them, at which point I sat down and figured the food would take a while longer to make...

20 min later and they still haven't called my name, and I started noticing customers that ordered after us being called up to get their food orders, which was not a good sign. I went up to the counter to ask about my order and when the employee saw my receipt, she had a confused look upon her face and rushed to the back to check the order screen. She never came back and appeared to be rushing to make my order. Then another employee approaches the counter to see what was wrong and acknowledged that I had been waiting a while. I told her I had been waiting 20 min and still didn't have my order. I asked her for a refund if my wrap hadn't been made yet, since we had to get back to work, and she immediately took 7 bucks and some change out of the register and handed it to me.

Long story short, we waited 20 min and had to go back to work with no food in hand. This place is great for smoothies but I would recommend staying away from the food orders because you'll be waiting a while, if you even get anything at all!"}
{"text":"I have been a regular customer for 2 years coming in once to twice daily.  Most of the staff knows my order when I walk in.  The regular staff is fantastic, but the new staff is terrible.  I have been charged the same price for my smoothies for all this time but now the new staff makes up there own pricing.  I am now paying $1 to $3 dollars more for my smoothie with the new staff.  Considering it is already $5.40 for what I normally paid it is a substantial increase.  I don't think I will be coming back.

  Back again and yet again overcharged.  Assumed management would care enough to read there reviews and fix the issue but apparantly they dont."}
{"text":"First time here the food had good ingredients but honestly I really came here for a smoothie and it was very delicious so as for juice and smoothies I will definitely come back. Good service and it's very laid back and chill."}
{"text":"worst tropical smoothie in vegas. 
they're rude and mess up orders."}
{"text":"Understaffed and inefficient. They took literally 20mins to make my ONE smoothie. Good luck with that people! The line was piling up quickly (to the door) and the staff had no sense of urgency. Management needs to do some reevaluating. If you're looking to grab something quick, don't come here. The two staff members they did have working, were rude and unhelpful. No thanks bye."}
{"text":"I see a trend here... Was so excited to have a tropical smoothie open in our neighborhood. Just like the other 2 reviews we waited in the drive thru for 24 minutes for 1 chicken ceaser wrap sandwich! My husband actually started to knock on the drive thru window to get somebody's attention and we would've left but we had already paid for the sandwich. There were no customers inside the store so can't understand what the problem was. Feel bad for the cars behind us cause they're probably still waiting for their food! Won't return"}
{"text":"Well, where do I start? First of all, the phone number on line is either NOT working or the employees are just not picking it up. I called a few times and let it ring with no answer.  So I decided to order online.  I place the order and get a notification that the order was ready for pick up. I get there and the there was two girls working.  No one even acknowledge me when I walked in, I walk up to the register and wait for another three minutes or so before one of them glances up and says we will be right with you.  Okay, I can wait.  Not a big deal.  She was clearly making a smoothie while the other girl looked like she was sweeping.  Finally the girl who had been sweeping the floor, comes to the register, I say hi, and in return get a blank stare and no response.  I tell her I ordered on line, she doesn't say anything.  Just walks to the back and starts to what I assume make my order.  I asked her is your phone working? She responded, I don't know, something is always not working around here?! I was like okay.  There were two other ladies in the store and one who overheard me ask about the phone. She goes on to tell me that she had tried calling in for several days with different orders and same no answer.  So I'm sitting there waiting, and the other girl that was originally making the smoothies, walks up to me with four smoothies.  I was confused, she like here you go.  I had to tell her that was no my order.  She then walks back and tells the rude girl at the register it wasn't my order.  Then the girl stops and grabs my order out of the refrigerator.  Here you go.  Overall, it was just a weird experience, the girl was so rude, and seemed irritated or maybe she just didn't care.  Who knows? As far as the cleanliness, the front of the store looked clean.  But the area in which these two girls were working looked a mess.  And now, come to think about it the girl that went from sweeping the floors to making smoothies didn't even wash her hands or have gloves on when handling the food.  Just makes you question, what is going on? I have order and been to this location many times and this is the first time I have ever encountered such a terrible experience."}
{"text":"This particular location doesn't offer extended hours like the other tropical smoothie cafes I am used to. They close at 7 which is prime dinner time. It makes no sense to me but they probably close early because they are in a typical 9-5 business center. The thing that disappoints me is that I work at the hospital just down the street and sometimes I get off late and just want a smoothie on the way home but can't because they are closed. Oh well!

The staff is friendly here but the only complaint I have is that last time, I ordered a salad and made it a combo for an extra $3. I was expecting a smoothie with a bag of chips as the picture depicted but only got my smoothie and salad. I totally don't mind not getting the chips but when I asked the older asian lady that gave me my salad, she basically rushed me and was very stern in saying salads don't come with chips! I was a little offended but whatever. Like I said, I don't mind not getting it but she could have been a little nicer about it."}
{"text":"I've never written a bad review or get lengthy as I always usually use yelp mainly to check in, explore, post pictures and add tips. I only say this because it's happen to me & my family 3 times already. 
As they are now open 24 hours, we came late last night at around 11. Even though it's late, the time didn't matter because it's happened already before during mid-day, & even when the place isn't crowded. It always happens or maybe I'm just exaggerating because I've seen it happen to others as well but here's the problem: they give smoothies we've ordered to another customer who actually ordered not right after us but a good five to ten minutes after us. This is quite irritable because, yes I understand everyone wants their smoothies, but that includes me and I'm sure anyone wouldn't like this to happen to them constantly. It's not just that, the time is lengthy for a \"fast\" service as everyone had said. Expect to wait for 10-15 minutes for a smoothie or two. If it happens once, it's okay. Twice, I give grace. But three times? They need a follow up with the way they manage things. It happened that last night, the other customer decided to raise his hand claiming that the smoothies coming out were theirs without the worker not asking who they are or making sure it's theirs. As soon as he brought out a pair of smoothies, they quickly assumed it's theirs. They take our names after placing the order, but I noticed they are never consistent with actually calling it which I assume is the intention of asking for the name of the person who makes the order in the first place. In fact, I'm even more disappointed that they don't seem to make sure ever that they are giving orders to the right people/party. Well, as the customers who got our order started drinking it, not even long but 2 minutes after, the same worker comes out calling out that customers name. I had been watching this happen of course, and from the beginning that he got drinks before us even though we ordered far long before him, I felt I am in no place to go to their table and to have to voice my belief that those are supposed to be mines. I did not choose to stare as I had already looked at them and felt that they realized it was our drinks when his actually drinks came out. I overheard them saying \"I feel bad for whosever drinks those were\". Not sure if they ordered the same drinks or what but the worker went back to the kitchen. They other customers left right after, probably in guilt, embarrassment or awkwardness because everyone that was there may have heard or that it was ours. Not sure which drinks, whether it was his (if he ordered the same we did) or if it were mines that he already drank that might have went back to the kitchen but it came out a minute after the worker went back in. As I finally received it, it was given to us quickly and the worker had not said anything but just politely as he could, he placed the smoothies we ordered in front of us. I took it, and left home because I felt our wait was long past my expectation. We were given the correct drinks and it felt that that was all that mattered at the moment. I did not feel in the beginning that I needed a receipt, so I didn't have that but I realized when I put in my straw when I was on the way home, the drink was quite melted and the amount that was given may have seemed like it was actually the ones the other people had had (someone already drank some of it). This is what I believe, and I wish I had watched everything to see if they which smoothies, the ones they drank or the second ones that were brought to him. It honestly just seemed like within the minute after he went back to the kitchen, he may have switched to new caps? They always take long, so I assumed I really did get the guys' order (the second ones that came out) or we got ours which they already drank. It's either or but I would probably not be surprised if I was correct. If we got the new ones, I feel he would have not needed to go back to the kitchen. 
But because our orders have been given to other customers the past 3 times, this is not any customer's fault even if they believe it's their food/drinks that are coming out but it is the responsibility of the team at TSC. I really hope the management changes & I don't believe that this should make anyone that it's happened to or that it might happen to, to feel unlucky. 

They need to simply fix this by making sure they know who they are giving it to, use the names they ask when it's ordered and call it when the order is ready and make sure it's really whose it is. THIS NEEDS TO FIXED. I've been here since a few years ago and hate to start disliking it and I would hate to have to give honest recommendation to  others to not come to this location."}
{"text":"Not bad not great but when you throw in sticky floors, employees that look like they are protesting personal hygiene and have to wait 20min for a wrap and a smoothie... bummer."}
{"text":"They moved... 
the new address is 9773 W. Flamingo Road. Their smoothies aren't as tasty as the ones on Jones & 215."}
{"text":"What sense does this make?

Me: I'd like a turkey,bacon,ranch/smoothie combo. 


Speaker: What side would you like?

Me: I don't like the baked chips, can I have the banana?

Speaker: Sure, no problem.

Me: Can you just put the banana into my Bahama Mama please?

Speaker: I'm not sure, let me ask.

Me: Ok.

Speaker: My manager says we can't.

Me: How come? That doesn't make any sense.

Speaker: We have to...(interrupted by new voice)

Manager Ashley: We have to charge you .50 to add banana to your smoothie sir.

Me: If I already own the banana as a side, how come it can't just get thrown into..(interrupted by Ashley)

Manager Ashley: I'm sorry sir you have to pay for extra banana.

Me: I don't need any extra banana, I want the banana I have already with my combo put into my smoothie please.

Manager Ashley: We don't do that, sorry.

Me: (befuddled) Fine.

I pull around to the window and pay. The young server with light eyes hands me my change and bag w/food and a banana and napkins in it. Shaking my head, I hand her back the banana and offer her the 50cent. Upon receiving my smoothie, I ask for the managers name, who gave me such an inconvenience then drive off."}
{"text":"Very cool choices.  My daughter took us here too.  She has found so many great places in Pheonix......."}
{"text":"One person taking orders and making smoothies.  Took forever to get the order.  Very poorly run place but they're all like this.  Don't go; they never change."}
{"text":"I've never received such bad service from anyone like I experienced from this store. I went in and order two smoothies plus a soda, and wraps.. The soda machine happened to be broken and instead of trying to help the me the manager and all employees were rude.. Making faces and giving attitude. I got a refund and left the store. I will not be returning to this store again."}
{"text":"Why is there only one employee working at this place EVERY TIME I have come here. Smoothies are great and so is the food, but you really need to hire staff. Not worth waiting in line for 30 minutes and another 20 to get your order. What a joke!!!!"}
{"text":"Walked in at 5:00 am after a late night and wanted to check this place out. 

Wish I could give a review based on service or food/drinks, but I can't because we got neither.  

I work at Starbucks so I totally understand the need to prep for the day, but the lack of service is unacceptable. The person working in the back glanced out at us multiple times and did nothing. No acknowledgement, no \"I'll be right there\". NOTHING.    Just hid back there as if we weren't standing right in front of the register.

Why are you keeping employees on payroll if they hate their lives, and why waste money on keeping the store open for 24 hours if you turn away customers anyway?! I just don't get it. 


If I could give zero stars I would. I think the workers here should go have some coffee, because they need to wake the fuck up."}
{"text":"Came here the cashier was turning people way saying that the register was broken and wouldn't be back up for possibly an hour or more. I feel like there is a far better way to handle this from a customer service point of view."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but this was just so annoying I ordered through uber a peaches and silk and club sandwhich. The club sand which had guac that looked like a dressing, and I got it for the reason that it comes with bacon but there was no bacon, whatever not a big deal. Let's talk about the smoothie.. peaches and silk.. here I am craving a smoothie I can enjoy but yet I feel these little hard pieces to find out that it's the middle part of the peach as if they threw the entire peach in and didn't bother to take out the middle part that you're not supposed to eat oh idk cause it's hard as a rock?! Here I am spitting the little pieces out as I drink my smoothie that I can't even enjoy and the worst part..? I gave some to my daughter of 4 years old not having a clue that these hard chunks were in the smoothie. Never ordering from here again!!!"}
{"text":"Fast service considering the crowd that was there while I was. Just like any Tropical Smoothie location the drinks are delicious and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"It would be a one star if it wasn't for the punch card. 24 hour drive through and specials. 

My drink; strawberry, banana and dark chocolate tasted like pure strawberries. I couldn't taste the banana and only at the bottom of the drink the chocolate. I wouldn't get it again. The only reason I drank it is because my car has no tint and I was dying from the heat.

My husband got the mango one and it was pretty watered down. I'm not a big mango fan but he is and he said he had, had better."}
{"text":"First of all, I have nothing against the employees that work there.  I have been going to TSCs for over 10 years in various states, and this is the worst one, mainly due to the owners, not only are they mean to their employees, but also to the customers.  I will forever be a tropical smoothie fan, just not this one, not now,not ever."}
{"text":"I really like the smoothies here and the options to add protein, etc to them. The food menu looks good but I haven't tried any of that. What is consistent every single time I go here is the horrible service. They are SO slow and I have never had somebody at the register who knew what they were doing. Today I tried to buy a gift card and both the cashier and then the manager could not figure out how to do it.  Every single time I stop in I swear it's the last time...."}
{"text":"This place just opened in University Circle.  The food is healthy, but can take some time to be ready.  It will be interesting to see how the staff matures to handle the lunch rushes at this location."}
{"text":"I love how we have a 24hr tropical smoothie in the neighborhood, a quick healthy fix for someone who wants to eat something healthy than the average fast food stuff. I've never had a problem with the employees or food, I give 2 stars for lack of employees. Every time, and I mean every time we come here, and I've been here real late and early there is always a wait and they only have ONE employee taking tons of orders and making food and smoothies by themselves. It's pretty sad actually. They are running around while people are waiting in line, what's up with that. Tonight I'm here and have waited 30 min, wtf? I even tried calling in tonight but it's too damn busy for the employee to even pick up the phone. Who's running this business?"}
{"text":"Always out of everything! Oh and don't forget when you come here you need exact change or card only. This place is ran horribly!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, no one acknowledged me. Two girls just chatting on their phone behind the counter. Then one girls boyfriend came in and they had a make out session in the restaurant. Also out of like all smoothies... disappointed"}
{"text":"I generally don't consume smoothies, but today I was in the mood for something light for lunch.  I visited this location and walked in at 12:30 to an empty store.  I placed my order and the girl at the register proceeded to dance, swinging her arms and legs as she handed the cup to the other two girls in the back, who were also dancing to the music.  I'm all for people having a little fun but when they screw up my order, that's a problem.  I ordered the Blue Lagoon and didn't start drinking it until I was half way home.  It was very watery and had very little flavor.  Certainly not a good impression on me.  

My advice, wait until the Jamba Juice opens up down the road and go there.  I've always had great experiences there and we can see the employees making your beverage as opposed to being hidden in the back behind the tower of cups."}
{"text":"Just had their Thai chicken wrap and it was so delicious and the girl in the back made my apple kale slaw fresh and it tastes amazing. Best one I went to so far. And the guy with pretty eyes made my acai berry drink and it taste great! Love this place."}
{"text":"Went through drive thru and no one was in front of us. We ordered our drinks at the menu and didn't confirm our order after we said it twice. I worked at a Starbucks for six years and I know sometimes it hard to hear. But then we get to the window and literally wait about 10 minutes and no one has come to the window to ring us up or anything. We can see everyone walking around inside like turtles. One girl literally doing nothing. And no one being rung up at the front. This was ridiculous. So instead of getting the smoothies we ordered we left. Customer service needs to improve and so does drive thru times. I understand if the company isn't based on that but don't have a drive thru if you can get orders out in less then a minute. That is the purpose."}
{"text":"WORST LOCATION EVER! Employees are totally unprofessional. Horrible customer service, 95% of the time they get my order wrong, wait time is always at least 15 minutes. The manager needs to figure it out and fix that place up because it is BRUTAL!"}
{"text":"Don't have an \"Open 24 hrs\" sign if you're not going to be opened 24 hours. Lights are left on and noises coming from inside the store. At least have the common decency to come to the door and let someone know why you're closed. 

Garbage."}
{"text":"What is the point of having a phone in your store if you dont even pick it up. All the employees are so slow at making orders and they aren't even busy! The only reason why tropical smoothie has any stars is because their smoothies are actually kind of decent. Aside from that, all of their stores suck. This location also smells like sewage."}
{"text":"Great customer drive! I love getting texts that say get a $2 smoothie. It certainly is cheaper than the ones I make at home. The staff were nice. My smoothies came up quick. I wanted to try one I haven't tried before and was apprehensive. The lady who waited on me said if I didn't like it she'd make another one for me. I actually liked it and didn't want her to have to make another. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I love the food and smoothies here, but upon arriving there was one other customer currently here and i came in with 1 of my girlfriends. The one guy takes my friends order at the window register and doesnt even acknowledge my presence. So, im standing at the register for 15 minutes without even being acknowledged by the 2 staff that are working and havent even taken my order yet. She comes up and asks if ive ordered yet and i say no, then the guy says, \"Oh you're ordering, i didnt even know.\" But he didn't even take the time to ask. She has already got her order and is currently almost done while i was told to give him \"one second.\""}
{"text":"Loved this place! Smoothies are huge for the price, and taste DELICIOUS! Got the mocha madness with a peanut butter add in, and it's one of the best smoothies I've ever had."}
{"text":"Got a lunch today through the drive thru and it was disgusting. I was so disappointed when we got home. I got my kids a cheese quesadilla and the cheese was not melted at all. I got a turkey wrap and it was drenched in so much sauce it was inedible. I will never come back to this location"}
{"text":"The only nearest place I can get my smoothies! They are delicious and offer great promotions , but it Takes an eternity in order to get your smoothie or food. You usually will not be greeted until 5-10 minutes later to be taken your order . Great smoothies bad service"}
{"text":"favorite smoothie place. sometimes it takes a long time, or sometimes people give you an attitude :( my rating wavers from time to time, depending on who is helping me."}
{"text":"Conveniently open 24 hours a day! Little slow during gym rushes but I try to avoid coming during Those times. Staff always friendly, especially when you tip. Seems like they can't show their tip bucket anymore but I know how this city works. Tasty, fresh and always helps cool me down. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I only come to this location when the girl with dreads and glasses is working. (This location is closest to my house.)Everyone else messes up everything I order there. From sweeping and picking up dirt and attempting to make food and smoothies without first washing hands to messed up orders to hair in food, all three stars are for HER"}
{"text":"They have some really good smoothies, especially the \"dessert\" ones. They're only about $5 and they're a good size. I'm not a huge fan of their food tho and it's a bit overpriced for what you get. I stick to smoothies only from there."}
{"text":"Good smoothie, but needs more selection in my opinion. Decent pricing is a plus. Staff are okay to deal with, not very social or friendly, just kind of exist there. Will go back again if I have to."}
{"text":"I ordered 20 jetty juniors for my daughters softball team for the after game snack.The staff there could not have been nicer and helpful!Kristin the manager even called the day they were to picked up to remind us and to offer to let us use a cooler to keep them from melting.Not only do they make quality smoothies but the staff there is top notch!Thank you again and I look forward to going back to your location soon!"}
{"text":"Greeted right away and quick service by friendly staff. Smoothie was excellent!  I'd recommend coming in for food as well."}
{"text":"The smoothies taste great! Sandwiches are just as good. I try to stop here whenever I'm in Phoenix, wish I had one closer."}
{"text":"Chicken in my flatbread was burnt and dry and my smoothie was mostly ice and watered down. I order the same things every time I go to any Tropical Smoothie and I couldn't even finish my food. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Every time I come here there is never enough staff. There is one worker here and 10 customers. She's in a awful mood and I've been waiting for 20 minutes and she hasn't even got to my order. TS you need to staff better... And have happier employees."}
{"text":"The service at this location is terrible! They do not care how long you wait nor do they care that you call in an order at 900am and then tell you 5 minutes till ready then at 940am after getting there and paying and waiting they still cannot get it together.  Even the shift leader Nicolas didn't seem to care that it took us 40minutes to get 2 smoothies we called in!"}
{"text":"We have come here for years,  best smoothies in town and always the freshest food.  Love the Flatbreads and sandwiches,  the salads have been a little disappointing for the price so stick to smoothies wraps and Flatbreads :)"}
{"text":"The chia banana peanut butter smoothie is awesome.  A loud the lines and go between Kemal rush hours. Love this place."}
{"text":"Just came to this tropical smoothie to get a bite real quick and they have children running this place. The child continued to show me attitude when I ordered a smoothie that he didn't even know about. You work here and you don't know what smoothies is on your own menu? Two of the children that were working there were poorly making jokes as I tried ordering and said \"it's a retired smoothie Bruh\". This is the kind of business you run? Absolutely ghetto. Oh.. and let's not forget the paper menu they wrote up with a black marker. Haha. I bet if I walked inside that the inside is exactly how I picture it in my head. Poor customer service. Thanks but no thanks."}
{"text":"The food is normally good, but the employees are obnoxious later at night. I like all music, but they turn up the hard core \"bitches and hoes\" rap music so loud around 8pm. When I walked up to advise them that there was a mother with her kids next to us getting really upset, the girl said, \"Ok?\". Like, what did I want her to do about it? I just told her to forget it and left. Keep your gangster smoothies to yourself while kids are in the store!"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming to this specific tropical smoothie. The young girl behind the counter Bre helped me out greatly, I didn't know what to get and she recommended me to some yummy smoothies. I ultimately got the chocolate smoothie and I wasn't disappointed! I've never had amazing customer service like this before, I will come out to this location for now on, even though its a little bit longer drive its worth it! Thanks Bre and everyone at Tropical Smoothie, my new home away from home!"}
{"text":"Absolutely slowest Tropical Smoothie on earth. Been here twice, and both times the wait was over 20 minutes for a smoothie... once at the counter once in the drive thru... won't be a third..."}
{"text":"Gave them a try the other day when driving by and wanting a smoothie. Tried the Rockin Raspberry. Thought it was very good and a reasonable price. 
I also tried a flat bread at another visit. It was okay. If I wanted a smoothie and didn't want to stop somewhere else to eat, but didn't find the flatbread worth going there just for that. The smoothies are great though and a bread price."}
{"text":"Amazing location. They blend really well too. Definitely try the dark chocolate beach bum. Definitely coming back to this one. :)"}
{"text":"Just came from this place, After we ordered at drive thru, We waited at the window for about 15 min and nobody even acknowledge us, then the person who finally came to the window was really rude and when we got the order it was all wrong. Meanwhile we could see there were no other costumers at the store and the workers were talking and having a good time in the store. Really bad service"}
{"text":"The smoothies are good, however the wait can be long sometimes. There is one person working there in the mornings. The other day is took me 15 mins just to pay and another 10 to get my smoothie. The woman before me ordered like 3 different things. The mornings are important because that's when people are headed to work. Maybe they should have 2 people...."}
{"text":"Probably the best smoothie shop in town. These are great tasting smoothies with a great selection. I love to get these as a mid day meal replacement. Staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"I love tropical smoothie but the service at this location is slow. The gentleman running the drive thru was also making the order."}
{"text":"So clearly I've been here a million times cuz I'm the Duchess baby!!! My go to smoothie the last few weeks has been the Chia MAXX. It's naturally sweetened with dates with a cinnamony banana flavor. It's a perfect smoothie for the morning or even lunch. 

I've also had all of the different tacos, the spinach and feta wrap (discontinued unfortunately), and this new chicken and bacon joint (clearly can't remember the name), but it was so good. The King Caesar is good as well. That used to be my go to for a while when I lived in Raleigh. 

I go enough to be known. I always get a greeting in the morning, \"Hi Mrs. S!\" I like that. I like that they bring your smoothie to you while you sit and wait.. or your food. 

They're pretty quick with getting your food or smoothie to you. There are so many options. I mean there's no need to sell this place. The actual location and staff are cool. I'm feelin them... which is why I continue to stop at this location. 

Now that they have a Rewards App makes coming here even sweeter."}
{"text":"Honestly this place is so slow. Why is there always only one person working?! They need to make sure there is more people working. Smoothies are great but they are so incredibly slow it's insane."}
{"text":"One person staffed at 7:30 in the morning and a 20 minute wait for a smoothie? Come on TSC, you have to do better."}
{"text":"Want to commend the staff for the quick drive-thru service and accurate order.  Elsewhere, waiting and the receiving the wrong item is often the case; not here!!"}
{"text":"Longggggggg waits at the drive thru, food is usually spot on, but when given the ticket to sign when paying with a debit card, you're prompted for a tip.. makes me feel like, tip us or we will lick your panini bread, so i feel guilty and tip $2, they never say thank you! what the heck guys. YOU'RE WELCOME! i rather just go get a slurpee at 7-11"}
{"text":"I agree with several posts about this place. I come here at least once a week and I think their smoothies are really good but they just cannot pump them out quickly at all. If you see even two or three people in front of you count on waiting at least 20 minutes even when they are slow."}
{"text":"Where to start. I've lived in Las Vegas for 5 years and have been meaning to try one of these cafes for a while now. I was running between meetings today and decided to stop by for a smoothie and a sandwich. This is 6pm on a Monday. And go. 

The Pen: I stood at the register for a while before I was noticed, no biggie. Orders a smoothie and a wrap. I pay with a card and go to sign. No pen. I ask for one, the girl laughs and says I don't have one. She yells to a young man in the back (who looks like he's been sweating over a hot stove for 8 hours, dirty and dripping in sweat - I'm thinking - please don't be the one making my food) and he laughs and says no clue where the pen is. They both stare at me, so I dig through my purse looking for one, no luck, so the girl shrugs and says oh well, and stuffs my receipt in a jar. Wait...WHAT?!? 

The Chicken: The man then yells to the girl up front to stop selling chicken because he's trying to prep it. My sandwich was supposed to have chicken, so she calls my order and JUST FOR FUN I unwrap it before I leave - no chicken. I ask her if it's supposed to have chicken, her eyes get wide and she's just like...oh...he forgot it...then proceeds to go in the back and whisper a (she noticed) as he glares at me and laughs, before reluctantly remaking my sandwich. He clearly thought I would leave and by the time I noticed, I wouldn't bother to come back. Good effort, but next time don't yell at your coworker to stop selling chicken in front of someone who just ordered it. 

The Store: As I wait for sandwich number 2, I actually look around and realize how disgustingly dirty this place is, garbage on the floors, dirt all up the windows. The floor around the register is horrific. At this point I realize I've made a horrible mistake, and I just want to get the hell out. I take my food (again I check my order) with not so much an apology, just a matter of \"that was embarrassing\" and leave. And thus concludes my story of my first and LAST experience here. The bummer is that the food & smoothie was great.

Morale of the Story: Due to the crazy number of horrible reviews about this place, it's obvious management doesn't care and things won't change anytime soon (although I do feel better now). Jamba Juice folks."}
{"text":"It was the worst. I was in the drive thru and intercom wasn't working. I was out in line for a good 20 minutes"}
{"text":"Came in here about 10:15 and waited for about 5 minutes before we saw any employees to take our order but that's ok. Ordered get fit smoothie, the detox smoothie, Thai chicken wrap and a bacon ranch sandwich. The food came out pretty quick and was warm!  The Thai wrap was good!  The lettuce and carrots were fresh and crisp and the chicken tasted good!!  The bacon ranch was very tasty and the ciabatta bread was soft n fresh!   I liked it a lot!!  My detox smoothie was delicious!!  Might be my new favorite!!  The get fit was really good as well!!  Don't be thrown off by the ingredients!!"}
{"text":"I feel I need to update from my last review because they have been much better about the availability of menu items. They have also been better about how they approach customers, especially when taking orders in the drive thru. As mentioned previously, the food usually comes out good, but wait times are more on the long side."}
{"text":"I'm in love. It is right by my work, open 24/7, and great prices! So, of course, we have to judge the food right? Delicious! I got the avocaolda ( huge smoothie and you can add to the shake) & I made it a meal with the chipotle chicken club flatbread and I'm super happy with it. Especially for $10- it's Vegas, you don't get many low cost health conscious restaurants here. Quick service. Quiet cafe environment in the morning on a Sunday. You can order online...."}
{"text":"It was ok! The girl couldn't tell me calories info, or anything!  Love the Durango shop better!  I got the sunrise/sunset smoothie with asses kiwi."}
{"text":"Great team, managment,, The drink and specials are awesome.. especially with the summers here. Like the food. But I love my smoothies more."}
{"text":"Not enough help At this location cashier isn't friendly looks like she is very pissed off to be working. 
 Will never go to this location again or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Always always just awful service!
Seriously guys, replace that staff of you haven't done so yet!
Every single time my order just sucks!
Hecka stingy on their meats! The salads are always dry and blah. The wraps have gotten smaller and less chicken! Less sauces, less everything but more soggy tomatoes and nasty cheese. Nothing ever taste fresh! That chicken salad sandwich is pathetic! I always take all the stuff in between the sandwich halves and pile it onto one half of the sandwich so it doesn't just taste like I'm eating all bread! The smoothies always taste watered/iced down. Too much ice! Why why why do I continue to pay ridiculous money for this garbage!?!? Oh because it's supposed to be a \"healthy choice\" on the go! Ugh! No more!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ok so I keep coming to this awful place just because a friend of mine chooses it for her hour long lunch! I told her the last time that I can't and refuse to go here ever again! 
So they had this salad that had bacon so I asked to add chicken.... For 2 smoothies and 2 salads with the added chicken it was almost a $30 yucky lunch! I just hate wasting my money at this place and refuse to do it anymore! Horrible employees and horrible food!!!!!!!! Overpriced junk!"}
{"text":"I come here pretty often since it's so close to my house. I love the tropi-colada! It's always crowded in here but they have a quick turn around with orders. I haven't tried the food here but it looks good!"}
{"text":"Who ever owns this location should fire everyone and start fresh. Well at least the dropouts you have in there at night. I just walked in to grab a \"quick\" shake on the go because I am a busy dude and I don't have the time to cook for myself all the time. However I could've made myself something damn good just in the time it took for someone to peak out and make sure the customer they were ignoring was actually still standing there. I mean maybe they're placing bets on exactly how long they have to ignore someone that walks in the door before the just walk out. 
The kid in the back looks at me like maaaaaan shit, this guy actually thinks we're gonna help him?? It's 2 in the morning. 
Anyways I'll never go to this TS location again. 100% would rather starve. 
Ohhhh did I mention I stopped by this place and got a shake and a wrap around like 6pm. The same homeless high school kid that was sitting in the corner, is now sleeping in the corner 8 hours later. 
What a joke of a store. Coorperate should shut them down on principle. Don't let a few lazy punks ruin TS's good name."}
{"text":"The employees touch everything (including the counters,  doors,  and money) without washing their hands or changing gloves. Pretty gross in that respect."}
{"text":"Won't be coming back to this location. Last Monday morning I was in a hurry to grab breakfast and I ordered a smoothie and plain bagel with cream cheese. First of all got a bagel that was I believe onion. Definitely not plain but I was hungry and in a hurry so I started to eat it. As I went to start eating the second half I noticed there was green mold on the second half. Who knows how much mold was on the first half i had already eaten. I went back through the drive thru to inform the staff and one of the girls took the bagel from me. Maybe so I wouldn't take pictures of it. I got offered a free meal but after this experience and reading another review I don't think I will be ordering anymore food from this tropical smoothie location."}
{"text":"This is my recent obsession. I try to come down at least once a month for this. They by far have the best smoothies i have ever tasted. I love the avocolada smoothie which i always get but i recently tried the peanut butter cup and i gotta say i am addicted right now. Wait times can be a bit long sometimes but you can call ahead to have it ready when you get there. The staff is wonderful and everyone is super friendly. Definitly going to be coming back several times"}
{"text":"If you want some ice hit up tropical Smoothie Cafe! I'd be better off going to 711 and getting a naked juice"}
{"text":"This place has tanked. The last 9 months or so I've thought to myself hey I could use a quick smoothie close to home, each time forgetting how bad my experience was the last time I came. I always wait in the drive thru for at least 15 minutes and smoothies are pure ice now, no taste. Just finished my last time ever coming here and waiting 20 minutes in line for 1 car in front of me, I watched that car and the only thing they ordered was 1 smoothie. Got mine and it was the wrong order. Don't come here, it's a waste of $6."}
{"text":"I love Tropical smoothie but this drive thru branch is seriously hit-or-miss. You could go there one time and get the best service, short wait time, and your food is on point. Then there are times when the wait is literally 30 minutes with two cars ahead of you, your smoothie is as solid as ice, and you drive off wondering was the money spent worth it? 

I think the inconsistent revolving door of staff members hurts them. Some know the menu and how to make sandwiches and smoothies with ease and then some are legit space cadets. 

The only reason and I repeat the only reason I come here as much as I do is the drive thru. I think the company should make more branches with a drive thru. It is also 24 hours which would be good if I lived in the area but all in all 2 stars for a place that is the epitome of a hit-or-miss food establishment. Order at your own risk."}
{"text":"The worst trop smoothie in the city. I came in on 7/30 around 10 pm. I literally waited for the lady to come help me. She was running around the back scrubbing something. There was only 1 drink in front of me. I received my order 15 mins later.

I ordered a chicken pesto and a lean machine.
My chicken pesto was room temperature. Wasn't even warm.
My drink was watered down. It's like she blended my drink with ice and 1 strawberry or something. It wasn't satisfying at all. It wasn't blended completely either. I literally had fat burner powder in my teeth. This location is garbage.

I always tip people 20 percent of my bill. But this lady didn't NOT deserve any. Yeah she was probably new or something but her attitude just killed my vibe. She didn't even smile. She had an angry face the whole time I was ordering. The managers here should hire random people off of Craigslist. Y'all need to hire people with social skills"}
{"text":"I LOVE my peanut butter cup smoothie and I've never had to wait in line. Every time I go there they are bumping my music however, as a business, I think they should have better music. The few times that I've been to this one I notice that they are way under staffed and people are in this long line out the door! People are starting to leave because it is taking so long. As mentioned above, I've never waiting, but as a business you should definitely have more than ONE employees working. I only go to this one because it is closer to home."}
{"text":"Talk about crappy customer service, frowns and scowls are always plentiful here! Smoothies are smoothies, nothing crazy. Food is alright. If there was another smoothie place near by, I'd probably be going there."}
{"text":"Love this place! Bailey is very nice and pleasant! He should be on drive through all the time:) the a singer berry boost and detox island green are my other favs!"}
{"text":"Heard it has improved from the past. The wait in drive through,  is ridiculous, same as inside, but the food quality is actually pretty good, good servings and prices not bad. Not Enough workers at peak times need better management directing service. I would not consider this fast food more of a patience kinda place, but the food is making it worth it so far."}
{"text":"Roast Beef Wasabi still delicious...the southwestern chicken wrap not so much. The wrap just had too many ingredients in it...the rice and corn in combo with the salsa took away from the chicken and it tasted like what I imagine a Picasso painting to taste like. no no to the southwest wrap."}
{"text":"Omg! I had ordered a peachbliss with peaches, banana & kiwi instead of strawberry. I love that the boosys are less than a $1.00 extra. BUT unfortunately I dropped mine on the way home so my BF went back before thryey closed @ 9pm n got me a Bahama Mama! Phew that thing was like dropping into a vortex n finding yourself on an island hammack listening to the breeze rush thru the tall forest trees & the waves clap against giant beach rocks. please note tgat the lighter colored smoothies banana & peach DO NOT have much flavor btw & seem to taste watered down:'( acai berry has loads of flavor BUT Im sure nothing can beat the Bahama Mama (white chocolate strawberry, pineapple & coconut)

{"text":"Employee was smoking weed with her boyfriend when I went to get a smoothie here. Did not like how it was made and requested to get a new one. She had an attitude and said she would rather give a refund. She was more concerned about getting back to her boyfriend and smoking on the job."}
{"text":"Online this store says 24 hours. I pulled up to this location around 9:30 and all of the doors were locked. There was one male employee cleaning and about 5 other people in the store drinking smoothies. I was trying to ask if the drive thru was open and everyone just stared at me. No one would open the door or even acknowledge that I was trying to order. Very disappointed. If the employees are allowing their friends in the store after hours but will not help a paying customer, they should be let go. This location needs a lesson in customer service."}
{"text":"My only complaint about our favorite smoothie place is that they are *sometimes* slow. It doesn't happen too often but when it does it's a longggg wait! The smoothies are always top notch and the food is always delicious! The price point is extremely fair and the service is always great. This location has a drive thru which might be our favorite feature! I'd definitely recommend as the #1 place for smoothies in town!"}
{"text":"Only one person working.... on a Saturday. The employee rang through the entire line without starting any beverages. The whole lobby is full, but everyone is just waiting. Come on management, ever heard of lean thinking? Seems like this place enjoys working harder, not smarter."}
{"text":"The reason they get as many stars as they do is because of cleanliness! I work in Summerlin, so visit the locations that one would expect to be cleaner. I was definitely wrong. This location is way cleaner than the Summerlin locations I have visited. 

Reason for lowering the review a couple stars: I stood at the counter for about five minutes without even being acknowledged. The lady looked at me and quickly away. No \"hi,\" no \"I'll be right with you.\" Nothing! That was a little frustrating. Then, as I was standing there waiting, some guy in the back yells at the top of his lungs, \"What the h*## is wrong with you?\" to the lady that was making smoothies. I'm not offended but at the same time, this was incredibly unprofessional. If I had a young child in there, I would've been upset. 

The smoothies tasted great! All around, I would return because of quality and cleanliness. But they do need to work on customer service!"}
{"text":"I usually come here after my gym session and love it here!! I came around 1:30 am and the kind gentleman who works there told me they actually changed the hours last month and they close at 1 now. Not his fault he was super kind and I understood but they should not say on here that it is open 24 hours when in reality it actually is not. The deception was so real. #ATadBitUpset"}
{"text":"It seems like everyone's first day in this place. It's taking half an hour to get a single smoothie out then they are getting sent back. It also seems like they forgot about 4 orders while I was there. Don't go here"}
{"text":"First of all, there was only 1 employee working. And he was definitely over worked. He was irritated & I came in irritated as well so it didn't help. He made both my drinks wrong & was going to make me the wrong sandwiches if I didn't remind him. He had a line of customers and they all ordered food & drinks so you can tell he was aggravated. It took us almost an hour total for 2 smoothies & 2 sandwiches. He shouldn't take it out on customers though. Get with your manager & complain cause this is a constant problem. Wouldn't have gone here because we originally went to the on off green valley but based off of Yelp reviews it seemed like it shut down & it just opened. That one had the same problem!"}
{"text":"The smoothies are excellent and a very nice indulgent. The sandwiches aren't half bad either. Try the Peanut Paradise, which is peanut butter and bananas. Mmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Can't complain about the food or smoothies. They are always delicious. But the service is HORRIBLE. They are always behind and slow. When I come in it takes about 10-15 minutes to make a smoothie. Now with their online ordering, I thought I could order ahead and show up later with my smoothie ready... But that's a bad assumption on my part. I ordered 30 mins ahead and show up with my order not even started. Upon arrival, the employee looked at me like a deer in headlights, and then finally saw a ticket sitting in front of the register and said, \"Ohhh, I never saw this. Let me get started on this right away\". I would not recommend this location at all. I would drive the extra couple miles to get a smoothie at a different tropical smoothie."}
{"text":"worst location when it comes to customer service!! first time coming here so i decided to go inside, there was a customer in front of me waiting for at least 15mins meaning I was waiting double that. nobody came to the register to take our orders instead they were working on the drive thru customers first and the line was pretty long so no telling when our order would've been taken. i decided to place my order through the drive thru and the wait was STILL extremely long management needs to hire more employees to prevent such a long wait instead of having 2 workers! smh"}
{"text":"What in the Sam Hill is this? A handwritten note? Unacceptable! Get it together Tropical Smoothie  #Unprofessional"}
{"text":"First meal coming to Vegas and I was craving a smoothie and decided to stop by here To grab a quick meal. Realizing that was one of the biggest regrets of my trip. Ordered a smoothie and Jamaican bowl. The Jamaican bowl was disgusting. Bland chicken with sauce that didn't taste like anything thing like Jamaican food. The smoothie tasted like a slurpee from 7/11 only 3x the price."}
{"text":"Very slow service at the drive thru. This is the second time in a row that I sat at the drive up for at least 5 minutes until they finally took my order. Each time there was only one car ahead of me. Today we look in the store as we passed by to see if it was busy and there was not one person dining in! I think the managers need to monitor this location."}
{"text":"Came in stood in line for about 6 minutes until the cashier even acknowledged my presence, then finally took my order. The other worker actually did start on the smoothies. There was no hello, goodbye, thank you, smile nothing. If I was the owner of this establishment or even corporate I would be very unsettled about how this store is ran."}
{"text":"The first word that comes to mind is YUMMY!  I am in this area every Wednesday and had been looking forward to eating here; last night I finally got the chance.  I had the Chicken Pesto Grilled Flatbread; great flavor at a great price.  The atmosphere is nice, very clean, with friendly and quick service.  I am already looking forward to trying the Peanut Butter Crunch and one of the many smoothies they offer!"}
{"text":"Heard so much good things about tropical smoothie cafe. But when i got to this one. The cleanliness was disgusting. I posted a photo of it on yelp. Tables where sticky. I waited by the register for about 5 minutes. Even though couple of employees saw me. Finally a cashier walks up and asked me what can he do for me. I asked him what can i get that is light on food. He liked at me pushed and and said \"huh\". He then suggested me to get a sandwich which was good and i got that avocado drink. I asked him how long will it take. He said five minutes. It took little longer than that. When i went to look behind cut window from front of the counter. They where just chit chatting. Once again one employee noticed and continued. The employees there seem to not want to work and had sour attitudes. Went to McDonald's next door for a friend to get something. They where way professional than here. Also there's this girl with red hair smoking inside her car. Right  in front with her apron and uniform on."}
{"text":"Went here with my girl today and I ordered 2 Kiwi smoothies and a flatbread chicken. Now I never had a problem with this location till today. The young blonde light skin girl couldn't hear a word I was saying no matter how loud I was. She was rude and very in polite. While giving my food she simply said \"here\". Both smoothies were terrible and not blended very well at all and didn't even give us straws. If she's working I'll never go back to get a smoothie"}
{"text":"AVOID THIS LOCATION LIKE THE PLAGUE. I have gone here a few times to purchase smoothies without any problems. Unfortunately, the last time I was there WILL BE MY LAST. I bought four wraps and three smoothies for myself and my family. I specifically asked the cashier (Darren) if he could split the transaction between two cards because I knew I did not have enough for the entire transaction in one of my accounts. (The total was $32.99) I asked him to run $31.00 on my first card, and the remaining $1.99 on the second. He looked a bit confused because I do not think he was properly trained in how to handle transactions between two cards. 

He ran my first card, and said it had \"cleared\" at $31.00. When I asked him to run my second card, he said not to worry about it because it had totaled at $31.00 so I did not owe him a remaining balance. I left the store, not thinking much of it. The next day when I checked my bank account, I noticed that Darren had run the entire amount of $32.99 on my one card. Due to this, it caused my account to bounce and I was charged a $35.00 NSF fee. I was upset, but thought that Tropical Smoothie Cafe would take care of it, since it was their mistake. WRONG!

I went back to Tropical Smoothie Cafe and asked to speak to the manager. I spoke to Darren again, who apologized for his mistake and gave me the manager's name and number. (His name is George Aranda by the way) Darren said he hoped that George would be able to issue me a refund for the NSF fee I was charged. When I called George, he got defensive and said he would have to speak to the owner in order to get me a refund. A week after I spoke to George, I texted George a picture of my reciept as well as a print screen of the transaction of my back account, showing that their mistake caused my account to go negative. I have not heard back from him since. 

I called back again, hoping to reach George at the store. I spoke to Nicole, who said she had \"heard\" about the issue that occured with my experience at the store. She said that George sent out an email, telling all employees to no longer accept two-card transactions. Wait...if the reason that I got screwed out of $35 was because your employees are not properly trained to split transactions between two cards, but instead of actually teaching them to do the procedure correctly, you are just going to avoid it altogether? THIS MAKES NO SENSE. 

I have filed a negative report with the Better Business Bureau and have contacted the corporate office twice. I will continue to contact the corporate office until I hear back from someone regarding this issue. 

George and the owner have yet to contact me to make this right. I pray that this location goes out of business because of their terrible customer service. People should not be treated this way. And I noticed that I'm not the first person on here that has given this location one star."}
{"text":"Usually like trop smoothie but customer service here is garbage. Smoothies were super bland so we asked them to be remade. They poured our smoothies back into the used blender, HUGE HEALTH CODE VIOLATION! The girl with purple here and gauges throws dirty ass looks and has a miserable demeanor. Yo..... it's costumer service. Fake a smile and pretend to be nice."}
{"text":"I had stumbled in here around 9:50 the other morning and because of my lack-of-sleep-induced haze I didn't realize they actually weren't open yet. Luckily I think the woman setting up behind the counter recognized that I was in serious need of a pick-me-up and any sentence longer than four words would confuse me so she happily took my order and made my Island Green with coconut and vitamin C. 

A+ for customer service!"}
{"text":"2nd time in a row we've been here and they're out of the vegetarian chicken. DON'T ADVERTISE SOMETHING IF YOU NEVER HAVE IT."}
{"text":"This is by far the WORST Tropical Smoothie their could be. Everytime I come to this one its a 30+ minute wait in the drive thru!!! This is ridiculous! I always say I wont be back to this location but its the only one around my neighborhood! This store should get better management because they are really the WORST!!!!!"}
{"text":"Walked in to only 1 person working sitting on the table on her phone with a bunch of trash all over the room.. no chips in the clear cabinet just some oranges, apples and brown bananas.. already wasn't too thrilled at all but really wanted a smoothie and a buffalo chicken wrap! Really wanted to know why someone who is by themselves wouldn't want to have the area clean and presentable for customers!! Who is the manager at this location how is this acceptable especially no chips out front to decide from and old fruit up front. Me and the lady behind me had to wait because only one person is working which is crazy to me. The buffalo chicken wrap usually is cut up chicken I get it all the time whenever I go to a tropical smoothie I got full pieces in both just pretty much told me my food was being rushed because there only being one worker. You guys have got to do better as a company I just scrolled through the other locations and you guys need to hire better and manage better or as a business overall you will be out of business!!"}
{"text":"These smoothies are the best! Even my babies love them! The flatbread sandwiches are really good to! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"The drive thru is always slow!!! Which I usually don't mind until tonight. If I wait 10+ minutes, I expect to get my drink on point. I don't want to wait for a drink that was made then sitting on the counter and melted once given to me. On top of that, the drink I got was made wrong. Don't even waste your time here."}
{"text":"Service was a little hurried and hectic but the end result was A+!!!

Happy hour from 5 - 7 PM is buy 2, get 1.  Such a great bargain for smoothies.

Even before happy hour the prices are really good for the sizes you get.

I loved the avocalada smoothie with mango instead of pineapple.

I can't wait to go again. If it was close I imagine going every day."}
{"text":"Dunno much about the café but the smoothie part was good sippin'.

I went the entire summer visiting AZ and never got a smoothie, so I dunno how I decided that once I got to winter it would be time for the smoothies to come out. Or the frozen yogurt (which I had later that same week) but that's my problem not yours. What you need to know is that they delivered.

I had some sort of mango peach orange concoction and loved it. Just enough tart to really pucker me up. I also tried the chocolate peanut butter thing, and that was surprisingly good. I forget that chocolate can be good in smoothie form, but this was peanut butter, too. Delightful, indeed, to wrap your lips around the straw and suck up to the decadence.

The two regular drinks came to $10, which is about on par with everyone else. Not cheap, but totally reasonable. No complaints."}
{"text":"First time in.  Wanted to sample chicken salad and they said no.  Then wanted to do a half a wrap and smoothie.  They wouldn't do that.  I offered to buy it that way, and they still said no.  Smoothies were overflowing all over the lid.  Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"I can understand the wait times during lunch hour, seems a couple locations only have 1 or 2 employees during  lunch hour which is insane.

Anyway, came here at 530am after  the gym,  no issues. My chia banana strawberry was awesome, the girl who was there doing drive thru was  nice and i got my smoothie  quick. Sorry i don't  know your name! :(  but thank you. I know working graveyard can be rough, i do the same shift. :)"}
{"text":"Went here yesterday with two of my friends and they had all 3 of our smoothies done in life 5-6min. some other locations take longer but i only see one or two people on staff and that seems ridiculous. 

 The 4 stars is only because I  think the chains need to drop the cost of some of their items but that's the price you pay for wanting to eat healthy. 

I really enjoy their energy booster since it works well for me without any crash."}
{"text":"It never fails. Every time I go to this location there is something wrong. Either messed up order, smoothie not fully blended, gave me back nearly  $5 in quarters as my change (are you kidding me) and now tonight they can only serve food not smoothies. You are called tropical smoothie, how can you not serve smoothies, especially when your food is garbage."}
{"text":"Smoothies good sometimes, sometimes they forget to blend them up enough. If you order food be prepared to wait......  and wait......... and wait.........10,15,20 oh we have a record 30 minutes of waiting the service went down hill after going 24hrs...."}
{"text":"Love the choices of wraps and sandwiches. The smoothies are very tasty and I like the fact that you are able to add \"boosts\" to it. Nutritious and delicious indeed. :-)"}
{"text":"How is it that you can order the same exact smoothie and baby it taste different every single time. Now normally they taste some what the same but today, the person taking my order was rude. And my smoothie tastes disgusting!!! I will not continue to support a company who can't even get their own recipes correct. Or staff that could possibly be making them nasty or gross on purpose. Either way. Horrible. Wasting my time now waiting for the smoothie to be remade. 

Update: Congrats Tropical Smoothie Cafe your unprofessional employees have lost you a good paying customer. So sad  your smoothies are actually good. Maybe you shouldn't hire people who don't know how to treat your patrons. Your people are literally costing you money. 

Shout out to Jennifer and the horrible service. Laughing like a blithering clown. You think I'm gonna consume anything giggling food service worker gives me. Stop it. Yup give me my money back! And I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Came in today and ordered the Half and Half. The cashier Sabina  was extremely rude. She claims that I couldn't get a half salad even though the menu specifically states you can get either half sandwich or salad. She went to the back made a big deal. And she was wrong. She didn't apologize either. I like the
 Food here but the service is what's gonna make me take my business else where."}
{"text":"This spot reminds me of Jamba Juice but u can also order other things such as sandwiches. Sits next to a movie theater.."}
{"text":"Drive through took 25 minutes. Seriously, I was stuck in the drive through for 25 minutes! How long does it take to throw some frozen fruit and yogurt and ice in a blender and mix it? Maybe they were using a mortar and pestle and doing the smoothies by hand?! The smoothie was delicious as usual though. -2 stars for the forever long drive through wait and -1 for no apology for the long wait when I finally got my order."}
{"text":"Always, always, always understaffed! Waiting 20 or 25 minutes for a smoothie is no where worth it! Employees always seem stressed out because they are overworked and understaffed! Poorest management I've ever seen for a small business!"}
{"text":"All the workers here are so nice! I love coming for smoothies with my friends. It's a great place to hang out! 

They're always fast and if your order comes out wrong or you just don't like it they're quick to correct the issue. Since I am in there often the workers remember how I like my smoothies and always make them perfect!"}
{"text":"They have a great customer service. Everyone is so kind and friendly there. Smoothies was so amazing. I looking forward to have other smoothies there. I love this location"}
{"text":"So happy to hear that Tropical Smoothie Cafe was opening a location near my office. I went in for lunch the other day and ordered the King Caesar wrap and Blimey Limey smoothie. The wrap was really good, though they would be better off with a different brand of tortillas (a little rubbery) - good amount of chicken, fresh lettuce, and tangy Caesar dressing. The smoothie was EXACTLY what I wanted - lots of citrus taste without being bitter. I added the weight management and energy supplements - they really worked. I was full (but not too full) the rest of the day and didn't have to endure the afternoon \"slow down\" at work.

I'll definitely be back for more"}
{"text":"We like tropical smoothie, but this location was terrible. Stood at the cashier for a solid 10 minutes before someone even said \" we will be right with you\" .   And they most definitely were not right with us. Pretty ridiculous. It takes 2 seconds to take someone's order."}
{"text":"Really really fantastic! They have excellent wraps and sandwiches as well. Great staff."}
{"text":"Crazy to see all of the bad reviews on here...
I frequent this location as it is close to work and I honestly have never had any problems. During the rush hour of lunch, sometimes there's a bit of a wait, but nothing excessive & is to be expected. I did encounter the \"owner\" others speak of a couple of times, and he was indeed very rude.
Other than that, the food is great, smoothies even better, and staff are very friendly. Will continue to visit :)"}
{"text":"DO NOT place an online order here. Just don't waste the time or hassle. 

I ordered a drink for my sick husband and wanted to quickly get home. I showed up when my order was supposed to be ready. My receipt was right there on the counter (clearly handled by an employee) and even said \"online\" on it, and the girl working said the order didn't come up on her different screen so she didn't yet make it. Okay, no big deal (even through it defeats the purpose of the online order) but you have a receipt right there showing that an online order was placed and when it should be ready by, lol. So then she tells me they don't have regular sugar and can make my drinks with Splenda instead (they also didn't have mangoes per a sign they put up on their door, which was an ingredient in one of my drinks). No thanks. I had already paid online so I asked for a refund and she told me it can take up to two weeks to get the money back on my card. WHAT a waste of time... And now I have to wait how long for a refund?! I am also wondering why no one called me to tell me that they didn't have said ingredients... It would have saved me the pointless drive down there. When placing an online order it asks for your phone number in case anything is wrong with it. What a joke! The place was empty- there's no reason why their customer service should have been so lousy.

I went to their main competitor and they were quick and efficient. Next time I will do myself a favor and skip Tropical Smoothie Cafe."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! The girl that took my order acted as if I was bothering her...again a lot of young people have no manners or respect in the workplace. She greeted me with a what do you want??? so freaking rude! Once I placed my order I said thank you and she said nothing! I will never go here again!"}
{"text":"This is the worst location I have tried. Nothing tastes the same as the other locations the staff are like drones not enthusiastic or happy at all.  I love tropical smoothies but will drive farther just to not go to this location"}
{"text":"This is the first place for which I ever used a full publication of coupons. I am genuinely in love. 

My mainstay smoothie is the health but. It's not overly sweet and is rather smooth and creamy. I feel like there is actually a good amount of sustenance behind it. Today I went with the southwest chicken salad and it far surpassed my expections. Id take a picture but it's already gone! 

The island green is definitely delicious too. I have tried a few others and have enjoyed them all. The only problem I have is I wish they had different sizes of smoothie but I won't hold that against them. 

Despite a bit higher price than the average place I pop into for lunch TSC makes it worth it in quality and I am more than happy to write a five star review!"}
{"text":"I pulled up to the drive through today and there was not a single customer inside. Proceeded to order 3 sandwiches. Time: 2:44. At 3:11 the person behind us in the drive through asked us to pull forward so that she could bail - apparently didn't have 30 minutes to wait for a smoothie - told us that she tried calling into the store and they hung up on her. We pulled forward to clear the lane and went inside to get the sandwiches and the person working was rude - not at ALL apologetic - dropped the food in the bag on the counter and said \"here you go.\" We then asked for the managers contact info and they refused to provide it. Got in the car and realized that they had failed to give us a receipt so we went back in to get it. Absurd. Management - you need to look into this. Check #7812. Employee named in receipt: Cassidy

Edited to add: Once we got home we realized they had given us the wrong chips and the Steak Tzatziki Flatbread was missing....wait for it....tzatziki. Nice."}
{"text":"Sitting here right now.  Waiting for a smoothie. Had to wait 10 minutes before even being acknowledged. 3 workers and 
only one up front while the other 2 in the back goofing around.  One customer just had to request that their smoothies be remade. The place is filthy and has been in the middle of a remodel for over a month!  This is last time I will come to this location ....the one on the LV strip by outlet mall is so much better.  The franchise owner should be ashamed of this store and corporate should be looking into this. Maybe even the health department should be looking at this location.  Viewing past reviews...I can understand new employees / training etc. but this goes beyond that!"}
{"text":"Great smoothie shop!! One size and good deals. It's a nice change from all the trendy smoothie/juice shops that charge an arm and a leg for a small drink....ugh I'm a sucker for those drinks! All their smoothies contain turbinado (sugar substitute) so I always request to leave it out. The fruit itself makes the drink sweet enough...Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"I love the smoothies and the food here, but the service is TERRIBLE!!!!! 

EVERY single time I come it takes forever to get my order. EVERY SINGLE TIME. I'm writing this review as I am in line. There were 2 cars in front of me and I've been in line for 15-20 minutes. They should consider hiring more employees to help make wait times a lot shorter."}
{"text":"Unprofessional. Inconsistent. 20-30 minute wait for food. Young kids working with loud music blaring in the back at times. Phone is never answered. One star quality."}
{"text":"Haven't tasted a smoothie i haven't liked yet!  If you sign up with them you can receive text message coupons that include 99cent smoothies or 2fers on rainy days. =)"}
{"text":"Actually never realized this drive thru was open 24/7 because every time I've come here I sat in the drive thru forever (with no cars in front of me) and no one ever took my order so I left. Today was the worst!!!! I sat at the order screen for 15+ min I thought maybe they were closed so I called, they assured me that they were open and that maybe the speaker wasn't working to pull forward. So I did, and then waited an additional 20 min at the window waving at the employees inside and still no one took my order. I was just about to drive off when one of the employees FINALLY took my order. There was no one inside and it took them an additional 15-20 min to get my order out. Doubt I'll be coming back to this location this is ridiculous customer service! and it's happened multiple times! Unfortunately tropical smooth cafe just must not care about this location because so many people have made similar complaints and nothing has been done about it."}
{"text":"I honestly thought they were closed when I walked up and walking in because it was so dark. Other than that...I got a Sunrise Sunset which was pretty filling, large, and tasted great.

Have to say...the one on camelback is better."}
{"text":"Came here around 3 ish pm. I would definitely read all these reviews. There were 2-3 people working today and it seems like they're still like understaffed or so what. I just ordered 2 smoothies and the waiting game began. Then there were too many people who ordered after me. They got their stuff before I got mine. Like seriously, don't you guys have the receipts and numbers to organize everything that you guys have to make? Do this first, then do this next?! Ughh, this location sucks!"}
{"text":"I could walk to Smiths, buy all the veggies and make my own smoothie faster than the 1 or 2 employees working here."}
{"text":"Ordered the chia banana peanut butter smoothie and it is amazing!! It came out super fast and the server was very friendly and nice! Thank you for an amazing experience!! Ps - cute tables!"}
{"text":"I recently moved so this is the closest location to me now. Been there 3 times, they screwed up my order all 3 times - 3 strikes you're out. 

The smoothies are inconsistent, they must have the ingredient ratios wrong. I threw mine out one time because it was so bad (got it to go, was not worth driving back to get a refund). 

The food is inconsistent. My husband ordered two cilantro lime tacos, they each tasted completely different.

Their computer is always out so they don't know which order was yours when you pick up at the drive thru.

I believe Tropical Smoothie is a franchise, if so, they need to take a look at this location and give it an overhaul. I wont waste my time here again.

I give it 2 stars only because I like Tropical Smoothie."}
{"text":"This is the worst place!! We have tried it a few times to give them the benefit of the doubt, but we have never had a good experience here. The staff turnover is high, and everyone looks like they hate their job. I don't know if it's the management or staff but whatever it is, this place doesn't work. We wait at least 20-30 mins for our smoothies. Even when it's slow. Our longest wait time was 45 mins for 3 smoothies and maybe 5 customers in front of us. I will never come her again."}
{"text":"One star. If you're the owner or manager you're getting the lone star because some of your staff sucks. I won't say all because I don't spend all week coming back hoping for better customer service, but on my recent couple visits its been fairly bad.

Instance one: Young brunette girl was way more interested in chatting it up with the other girl in the back then focusing on her orders. You have a line and people waiting, yet somehow discussing snapchat was her main priority. Always a pleasure when someone tells you \"Have a nice day\" with their back turned.

Instance two: New guy overcharges order on free boost sunday. Thats ok, he's learning and he wants to do right by the customer by offering extra boosts to compensate. The problem is that he's clearly having difficulties processing the orders and making smoothies, and the other guy is too pre-occupied being \"fake-busy\" to offer him help. The cashier is new, get off your lazy tail and help him for goodness sake. 

Instance three: There won't be one. I'll go to Krayvings down the street and pay the extra $2 for better service."}
{"text":"Ordered \"beach bum\" last week. Pretty good, decided to come back for another helping. Didn't taste at all like the first week. Basically just a plain strawberry/banana shake for $6. Should have asked for a refund."}
{"text":"Yummy food and smoothies, but you can find that at any TS. The drive through here is painfully slow (I'm talking 20+ minutes to get my smoothie and an additional 15 for my flatbread) and the employees are totally unapologetic. Bummer, 'cause this is the location that's closest to my house! Guess I'll have to drive a bit further to get my TS fix!"}
{"text":"I've been to plenty of Tropical Smoothies in town and this is my second time at this one. This one is located in semi-deep northwest area off the 215/Cheyenne exit inside a shopping center. It is tucked away in the corner on the north side of the center, easy to find. I had no trouble parking as there were plenty of spots.

I walked in and ordered the Buffalo wrap and asked for a cup of water, they told me they don't have that so got a sprite instead. Some of the tables had liquid and food on them and were quite dirty, the restaurant was not busy so this is totally unacceptable. I cleaned the table I sat and waited anxiously for my buffalo wrap.

About 5 minutes later they called my name and my wrap was ready. At first it looked like they were little to no chicken inside my wrap however once i bit into it I discovered it was tucked underneath the tomato and salad. There was a zingy spicy zest to it and be honest I enjoyed it very much. Good quick lunch, fairly reasonable and healthy (from what I've been told). 

Maybe it was a fluke with the tables being dirty, the staff was friendly and looked clean and I walked out satisfied as far as my tummy being satisfied. If work brings me to this area again I won't hesitate to have it again, maybe the Jamaican Wrap next time."}
{"text":"A great little gem! Jersey Mikes has always been 'meh' for me, so I decided to try this place out. The hummus wrap was delicious and the smoothies looked amazing. I will definitely get one on my next visit. The lady at the counter was very nice and helpful too. :)"}
{"text":"I honestly don't know why I keep coming here (other than it being close to work) The service is terrible and they never have enough people working. There is no reason a smoothie should take 20 minutes to make."}
{"text":"Awful service and served everyone before me. When I finally received my smoothie it was mostly water. Threw my card on the counter and was hostile towards everyone she served. March 26, 2017."}
{"text":"They always have really good quality smoothies, but there is always a long wait period
Nevertheless I always go here
I often get the \"Bahama mama\"
Gf gets the beach bun with dark chocolate"}
{"text":"Christian deserves a raise. The owner of this franchise needs to get it together. Christian's coworker is sitting outside in front of tropical smoothie eating his food and taking a break while customers are waiting a ridiculous amount of time and some of them leaving because Christian is the only person working and is literally taking the orders and making the smoothies and making the sandwiches. I was going to order a sandwich but already spent a ridiculous amount of time in there. Christian is a team player he had a great attitude and did what he needed to do I suggest you don't burn him out so you don't lose him. I understand there are labor laws but it really looks bad to have an employee sitting outside eating your product in your t-shirt. It is up to the owner of this franchise to bring his ass into this location and work so his employees are not alone and can get the brakes. Luckily I don't live on this side of town so I'll never be back."}
{"text":"The 4 stars is for the customer service and excellent customer service as well as the perfect smoothie that only 4 staff members make there are 2 nice Filipino boys an awesome Samoan Pacific Islander girl who's name I think is Adriana  and a sweet African American boy.  I go there almost everyday as long as one of the four is there the others are horrid sassy grumpy and the smoothies don't taste good - the owner manager needs to get rid of the dead weight and give the awesome ones kudos"}
{"text":"I came in on a monday at 2:40 pm came there were 2 police officers and thats it i placed one order for chicken chipotle flat bread and acai ...there were 4 employees and it is now 3:00pm the manager is supposed to be some chaey lady and she nowhere to be found ...i asked for my refund and even that took long  ."}
{"text":"This tropical smoothie is seriously RATCHET I'm on this side of town and the only reason why I am visiting this location. I'm here for the brand and know what I'm getting... I was here last month and the same thing... The wait is absolutely unbelievable! For example, I walked into this store at 1145, and yes I am STILL waiting for my smoothie! Hence the reason I decided to write this review! There are only 2 people working (with no sense of urgency). I have already witnessed 4 people walk out who have been waiting in line. In fact, when I was here last month, the same situation! My wait in line was over 10 minutes without my order being taken, so I was one of those customers that walked out of line...wait, one more just left the line... Ok, it's 12:13 and I just received my smoothie... This location got one star from me only because the cashier was very pleasant and calm,aunt a little too calm... Wtf?!?"}
{"text":"For our first time here, the entire experience was a turn off. Drinking an ice slushy that tasted like water with a splash of kale wasn't my intention or idea. Hey, I get it, they are trying to be \"au natural\" and healthy by using turbinado as sweetener or whatever. But man, should the smoothies also not have any flavor? 

I ordered the newly advertised \"Island Green - Spinach, Kale, Mango, Pineapple & Banana.\" I also added vitamins: energizer, B12, Vitamin C, Multivitamin - it racks up fast at 99 cents each. I said the hell with it, since I was feeling under the weather.

The drink was very disappointing. I definitely expected more substance and flavor from all of the vegetables and fruit it advertised. No mango, no pineapple, no banana flavor? It wasn't even naturally sweet from those fruits and vegetables. It was a light green color and all I could taste was a light hint of kale, mostly watered down. 

It had waaaay too much ice compared to the fruit/vegetable/sweetener ratio they put into it. It was not worth the $9 and change. 

Other annoyances:
1. We could barely read the menu on the wall due to blinding glare from the lighting in the place. (The girl just looked at me like I was crazy that I couldn't read it.)
2. The girl behind the counter seemed annoyed we didn't know the menu since it was our first time there.
3. All around uncomfortable vibe.

I would try another location in the future in hopes that it's not the company itself that makes terrible drinks, but just an isolated situation with an employee."}
{"text":"This kid needs to go. I originally had gone to the location on charleston and indigo, this guy hates his job and is the only one working there. He's garbage. Took our order with an attitude and took forever. Today, I decided to go to the one on Sahara and Fort Apache to avoid the same experience. The same guy was working the shift by himself again, and same shity attitude. It was 8pm when we order and 8:30 when we got out food and smoothies. He rush us out due to the fact that he was closing at 8:30 instead of 9pm. The chipotle wrap wasn't that great. Our smoothies were disgusting, too much ice. Tasted like a water down sprite. Who else has this experience?"}
{"text":"Love this location with the drive through!  They are very polite and efficient.
I had my usual buffalo chicken wrap, which is so delicious, have never found a wrap this good w buffalo chicken, the sauce just spicy enough and so tangy!  The Romaine lettuce and diced tomotoes balance it, with the lo cal Mozzarella cheese - tip:  I usually reheat that way the cheese melts into it!  Also had the Pineapple Delight - yummy! The pineapple delicious, bananas making it sweet, and the orange balancing out the sweetness.  Tasted like Hawaii in the mouth! Enjoy summer at this place!"}
{"text":"Awesome unbeetable smoothie and baja flatbread!  The beets with berries make this yummy while being healthy.  Love the drive thru"}
{"text":"Okay here's the thing, love the food, hate the service. I ordered two smoothies and only gave me one!!!!!!! They get my order wrong 95% of the time I go there and I go very frequently. Not only do they get the order wrong but they're so rude when you correct them. \"I read the menu to you and you said I island green\" what nerve! She could of said it nicer. It wasn't a big deal until she had the worst attitude, will go back and talk to the manager"}
{"text":"Great service! Friendly staff, great smoothies and food. Highly recommend this cafe. Very convenient location!"}
{"text":"Usually don't write reviews unless it's spectacular or very mediocre and this just happens to be not spectacular.  I've been to this location multiple times, busy and slow.  It wasn't busy this time..1130pm, this being a 24 hour location, no one in line.  There was 3 ppl in the store, but found out after I received my order, were just friends of one of the staff members.  Ordered the smoothie and half sandwich, asked if the brioche sandwiches were part of the deal, no, cool, will just get one of the halves that are included.  First off, I haven't been here in a few months and the last time I was here the smoothie and half deal was 6.99..not anymore, inflation, I get it..customer service was sub par, no asking what type of protein with my smoothie and very short, okay, what's next..food was terrible, usually get the turkey, bacon, ranch but went with the\"new recipe\" chicken salad..I got a sandwich of cranberries, apples, some nuts and a few crumbles of chicken (see picture), those chunks are apples.  The sandwich just fell apart.  I just wasted 8$..very disappointed..this it's my review"}
{"text":"I loveeee the smoothies here. Some of the food is eh but I find myself craving the chicken pesto flatbread from time to time. I'll even buy the peanut butter granola honey wrap for later. It's so yummy. Only downfall is this place is understaffed sometimes, so I only come in when I have free time."}
{"text":"I like sunrise sunset :)  I had a chicken sandwich thingy too thats not too bad too"}
{"text":"Great customer service. I got an Island Green Detox smoothie. I had to eat it. Next time I'll be sure before I get it to go."}
{"text":"Pros: they have a drive thru. I got a turkey sandwich with no tomato, and I actually got no tomato! Beautiful location right next to the McDonald's on farm and Durango! Dining room was actually clean as well. Cashier was very nice and patient. I actually forgot about the 2 for 3 smoothies and she asked if I wanted to add a 3rd for free. That's really nice and cool. 

Cons: they can't make anything off the retired menu. All of Ann (she owns most of the TS's in Vegas and Henderson) makes them because they have it in the back. They had the ingredients, but didn't know how to make it. Also they no one wears none slip shoes. Maybe it's not forced, I don't know. But I worked at one of Ann's stores and it was required since there are many sinks with water everywhere. 

All in all, great location! Will be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite location. I've never had a \"bad smoothie\" here. They taste fantastic, as well as the food. The service is great too. Sometimes there's a long wait time for food (I once had to wait a half hour), but other than that I love this place."}
{"text":"Their island green smoothie is my absolute favorite. It's sooooo good. Every time I come here, I get great service and never have to wait too long for my smoothie. I love that this place is conveniently open 24 hours so I can stop by after I get off work (I work really late hours sometimes) or after a late workout."}
{"text":"I was craving a smoothie and came across this place while running errands. 

First off, the teens that work there are very friendly and attentive. They also know the menu very well. 
Second off, the environment was clean and inviting. 
And lastly, the smoothie was delicious...I will be returning ! 

Oh, and they only have 1 size smoothie, but they are so good you will drink it all."}
{"text":"Walked in & the systems were down. The place was trashed. You can see the trash overflowing from the trash can. It was a bit busy & I understand if the systems are down but CLEAN AS YOU GO. There was a weird smell in the place. First time wanting to try it out & I don't think I'd come back to be honest."}
{"text":"Having only been here once, and while it was super slow, I can't really give a full review.  However, I will say, the beyond meat option is fantastic, and makes for a yummy sandwich :)"}
{"text":"THANK YOU CHARLESTON LOCATION FOR KNOWING HOW TO MAKE A PINEAPPLE TWIST! miss that drink on the menu!"}
{"text":"I want to give this place a negative 20!! Why is this place still open. Who are the people running this place ? Who hires these ignorant rude employees? Why are content with having a store with such terrible customer service, reputation and staff?? It just blows my mind. Almost every single review on her wants to give this store zero stars. This is so sad when will they make a change ?"}
{"text":"I originally came in because I bought a Groupon for this place a month ago and the lady working there wouldn't take it because she said it was for another Tropical Smoothie in Gilbert. There's not another Tropical Smoothie and I let her know. When she still refused to acknowledge my Groupon I asked to speak to a manager and she rolled her eyes and said she was the manager and she was not going to take my Groupon at all. I called Groupon and they had said there was a misprint on the Groupon and that I did go to the correct store. However I was too pissed to go back. 

Came back a month later with my guard up. I didn't need it, because that horrible woman wasn't there and apparently it was happy hour! The guy behind the counter convinced me to save my Groupon because my order was cheaper on happy hour. He was just all around friendly and helpful. It made me glad I gave this place a second chance!

Now about the actual food - it's not exactly paleo friendly. Everything is pre-processed including the smoothies which are just a bunch of powder and juices mixed together. The sandwiches are nice but not amazing. If your looking for something sweet and refreshing I would try the cranberry truffle and if you like pesto then you can't go wrong with the Chicken Pest flatbread sandwich.

Will I come back? Yes - only to use up the rest of my Groupons and only for Happy Hour. The food isn't good enough for full price."}
{"text":"I have been in search of new smoothie places because Arizona is just a smoothie induced climate!! Nothing like a refreshing drink full of protein and nutrients that is light on a hot night!

For the most part, the people working there seem to be all over the place. I have seen the manage a few times and a lot of different people making my drinks as of late. It seems to have high turnover.

Beside the staff, I find the drinks to be perfection!! There is only one size and that size is large!! When I'm in a dessert kind of mood, I get the peanut butter cup. Seriously, that thing is better than a shake and I am totally a shake girl! They have a diverse variety of ingredients and offerings for everyone!

If you want a good deal for your money and you don't care about customer service, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"ok so i come here the other day and they ran out of ice????? and i come today and they were out of fruit. like all the fruit. how the fuck do you run out of those two things???? i'm upset"}
{"text":"I am actually IN SHOCK at how long my boyfriend and I sat in this drive thru. We got there at 2:15 pm and I was watching the time because I had to be to work by 3. When we pulled up, she asked us to give her a moment so we did. 2:25 comes around and we asked \"are you there\" and she said \"yes give me a moment please I'm so sorry\" so I was gave her the benefit of the doubt. Someone comes on about 5 minutes later and takes our order. We pulled around expecting to be right at the window, NOPE the same cars that we saw when we pulled in the drive thru WERE STILL THERE!!! We waited another 10 mins and we finally got to the window, no one came so we are waiting waiting waiting and 2:50 comes around and NO ONE CAME. I can't believe we wasted all that damn time. You guys have had a drive thru for a long time, you should KNOW by now how to handle things when it gets busy!"}
{"text":"Service hasn't gotten any better. Went in for a free \"earned\" smoothie and was informed that the promotion ended in September and I would still have to pay full price for the smoothie. I left it there. Not even worth the money anymore. 

Service is awful. THE WORST! These people must be really miserable..."}
{"text":"While service was sub par, the smoothie was not tasty. I ordered a strawberry beach and it tasted like a kiwi quencher. :( don't know what's hard about strawberries and yogurt. Been having bad luck with this franchise all over town."}
{"text":"I go here because it's close to work. The female employees probably should look for a new \"career\" because their attitude shows just how much the \"love\" their jobs. 

The customer service here is awful! The girls will go sit in the back while the guy tries to take orders, stock fruit, and make smoothies. 

Very inconsistent smoothies. I always order the same one and it's always different tasting. Literally saw the guy using the sink tap water in multiple smoothies. The \"pump\" of water was empty. If that's how the smoothies are made, cool.... But customers don't want to see you get the water from the sink. This smoothie is WAY WATERY!!! No measurement when you don't have pumps to count. 

Asked for a thicker smoothie because I drink them really slow and they melt fast. It's super thin and is basically water. 

The employees are NEVER warm or welcoming at this location."}
{"text":"The smoothies are way better than Jamba, and the wraps are tasty and relatively healthy.  Their prices are decent and the device is usually friendly."}
{"text":"Tropical Smoothie has a 2 for 1 special from 5pm-7pm. I waited hours for this and drove to the Tropical smoothie cafe on Craig just to find out that not all the Cafés' here have the same special. This is the first time this has happened and I'm super disappointed"}
{"text":"I'm new to Charlotte & needed a good, healthy & tasty smoothie after my work out & based on my visit, I'll be back often!  I tried the Avocalda smoothie which had kale, avocado, pineapple, coconut, spinach & mango.  I tasted the fresh ingredients & truly enjoyed my smoothie!"}
{"text":"The smoothies were super icy, sour and sometimes flavorless. I do not recommend getting a smoothie at this location."}
{"text":"Smoothies and food are delicious, but drive through wait times are long. If you're third in line, be ready to wait at least 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Line out the door, two staff members. No one taking orders
Waiting now for 10 minutes.
Either understaffed or poorly trained"}
{"text":"I have spent over $5,000 in 3 months with Tropical Smoothie and I have to say that their Drive Thru Service and customer service are just horrible. I wait over 30 minutes in their drive thru and the owner's resolution was a coupon that you can get in the mail. If your time is valuable you may want to consider going to a different Tropical Smoothie with owners who care about their customers needs."}
{"text":"With a couple dozen locations scattered around the Las Vegas valley, the Tropical Smoothie Cafe probably has a store near you and it's a good place to stop if you're in the mood for refreshment.  You'll find the standard assortment of fruit-based smoothies on the menu as well as \"superfood\" smoothies (fruits high in antioxidants, and greens), \"supercharged\" smoothies (featuring added proteins), and \"indulgent\" smoothies with options to include chocolate, peanut butter, coconut and coffee.  After trying the Sunny Day, Kiwi Quencher and Mocha Madness, it seems they're all consistently good.

The menu also includes light foods:  wraps, sliders, sandwiches and salads just to name a few items, and they're open all day.  There are menu items for every meal and even a kids menu!

The restaurants I've been in have all been clean, the service was friendly, and my order was prepared quickly.  Consider giving their light food items a try, but be sure to go for what the chain is named after:  smoothies.  Delicious on a hot day or after a workout!"}
{"text":"I don't have one complaint about this place. Every time I come, the customer service is AMAZING! I order the peanut butter cup,well blended and a southwest omelet wrap. The southwest omelet wrap is small, but mighty. It definitely fills you up with a smoothie. Tristan provides excellent customer service every time. He is so sweet."}
{"text":"I went in after a long late night workout at the gym. I arrived at 1:50 and I noticed all the chairs were up on the tables and the floor was still wet from being freshly mopped. I was really looking forward to getting a nice superfood recovery smoothie.. I walk up to the door and sweet it's unlocked. I walk in and a young man and a woman were standing behind the counter. I asked \"hey are you guys still open? I'd like to buy a smoothie!\" The woman didn't even acknowledge my existence and the man just smiled and stared at me while he thought of an excuse to not serve me. So I asked again \"are you guys open!?\" The woman still refused to look in my direction and the man shook his head no and lipped the word \"no\". Thanks for ruining my otherwise great Saturday night tropical smoothie! Maybe next time you won't  put lazy kids on the night shift. I'll never know. I'll be taking my money to Jamba Juice from now on!"}
{"text":"Maybe this was just a really off day but I came here with four coworkers and waited an hour and fifteen minutes for our food. There was only one person working so I'm assuming someone didn't show up to work. I felt bad for her at first since she was the only one working, and I thought we were all very polite and patient but she was blatantly rude and angry at us.  After waiting an hour and a half for a smoothie and salad, you'd think she'd say \"thanks for waiting\" or \"sorry about the delay\", but she did not say one word and basically just mean mugged us. And I never have a bad review. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"If I could give this tropical smoothie 0 stars I would. This was the worst drive thru I've ever been in my entire life. Seeing a pretty solid line of about 6 cars, I decided to tough it out and wait as I just had s procedure done on my foot and couldn't really walk. 25 minutes later- the line hadn't moved. I ended up backing out and going elsewhere along with 6 other cars and this location lost a ton of business. Not sure if they had only one person working or if they were having issues but I definitely saw two people leave out the back and not one of them said anything to us while sitting in line. Clearly this franchise needs new management or to just close. Such a lost opportunity as there are many homes, lots of traffic and no other drive thrus."}
{"text":"Best TSC in the system I think...this one seems super clean and new And the guy that helped us was a rock star!!!! Super friendly and hard working.  Brought our smoothies out to us at our table.   Nice job guys!"}
{"text":"The breakfast smoothie was amazing. But I recommend the ham bacon omelet wrap"}
{"text":"Super slow!!! Ugh 
I have to remember NOT to come here
Again
....
30 minute wait in the drive thru"}
{"text":"There were no customers on 3/3 and the girl who took our order had a stone face not welcoming at all or happy. When I asked for the keys to the women's bathroom to wash my hands she was nasty about it and said it's NOT locked. 10-minutes later an employee, a male came out of the women's bathroom saying his stomach hurts. 
Horrible employees for a nice area.
Need to be retrained by the employees at the store on Town Center!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this place very much. Unfortunately they are getting expensive so it's kind of hard to say I would go all the time.  They do have great choices but it honestly takes them a very long time for them to make good when ordered.  I rather go in the morning the service is great and the smoothies are good.  Sometimes they don't make the smoothie correctly but for the most part they usually make good smoothies."}
{"text":"Bring back the punch cards the text coupons suck. The female employees are very rude and the waiting is horrendous"}
{"text":"THANK YOU FOR NOW BEING 24HR! i'm a regular at trop smoothie. i love me some pineapple twist (although they discontinued it on their menu, i had to write the recipe on my phone just so i can tell them how to make it), i also love me some peanut paradise with soy and 1/2 splenda. the king ceasar is my fave wrap. and i'm not too familiar with their sandwiches. but its great that they have fundraisers for different organizations. and it's always a good visit when you have a free smoothie from your punch card!"}
{"text":"I spent many an afternoon here in high school, and the smoothies were better then, but that's the only thing that's changed. The menu is smaller and doesn't seem to be as diverse, but walk in at 3 o clock on a weekday and you'll find hoards of teens meeting up with their buddies , little dudes with their ear pierced who think they look cool spitting game at the cute 14 year old girl next to him, and the surly 17 year old with black hair and black lipstick behind the counter. LOL."}
{"text":"Staff here is nice.  Fast.  I always order the Bahama Mama.  Strawberries, Pineapple, White Chocolate, and Coconut.  Sweet and delicious.

Other good smoothies I would recommend include: Island Green, Sunrise Sunset, and Avocolada.  

While I'm not particularly fond of their food, the flatbreads are nice for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"If you them to be out of what you want, paying for your order to be made wrong or to wait in a drive through for 20-30 minutes, go to this location.  8 or 9 times out of ten these things will happen.  Awful.  When they get it right(rarely), the food and smoothies are good, but all this consistently still happening is inexcusable.  I think I'll take my money somewhere where they know what they're doing."}
{"text":"So good! Super fast service and perfect for lunch time! 

I usually get the rocking raspberry which is amazing! Their service is always great and they are very accommodating if I'm asking for Splenda or less sugar! 
Their wraps are always great too!"}
{"text":"I love this place when I am trying to eat healthy. I recommend the health nut smoothie. The people that work there are very competent and friendly. The bathrooms are clean, so are the tables and floors.
They got a cool sitting area hiding in the back, super cool. The even served me at my table an brought me napkins and a fork!
The health nut smoothie with strawberries instead of blue berries is to die for. The staff is great. Good job guys, and the food is super tasty for being healthy."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst tropical smoothie I've been too. This is my 4th time coming to this location because it's so close to home but I get disappointed every time. The workers are rude and I honestly feel it more out of frustration because they are always behind and doesn't seem they have enough staff to keep up with the demand. The location is dirty and the restrooms are a mess. Would hate to see how the kitchen area is. Guests are ignored at the counter and not greeted when you come in. I have never waited less then 15-20 mins for a smoothie. The food items always seem off. Seems like they don't follow the same recipe that all other tropical smoothies follow. It's hard to believe that management turns a blind eye to this location and all the bad reviews. When you have a yelp rating of 2 stars overall it's literally a scream that this location needs help. No standards or leadership are found at this location. Doesn't belong in the Summerlin area."}
{"text":"Four stars for the girls who work here but the new guy with the curly fro, minus a star.  He keeps coughing in his hands.  I told him to wash his hands and he just looked at me, then went back to making people's smoothies.  Thank God one of the regulars was there.  She made my smoothie and I let her know about the guy.  She said something to him and he continued to work.  I will call management and if I see that guy there again, I will have to find another tropical smoothie to go to."}
{"text":"I concur with the previous negative reviews.  No greeting at drive thru.  Backed out of the drive thru then went inside.  I called out for help, and heard a male and female voice laughing.  What did I do next, I called while in the store.  The phone rang and the voices in the back continued but bothered not to even answer the phone!  We will not b patrons of this facility."}
{"text":"So disappointed , this location is my to go spot when on the run . Unfortunately I have to draw the line . Water down smoothies , long wait times and just 1-2 people in line , hours posted wrong on website , store and yelp . Or do we just close when we want to each day ? Then there is the \"sorry we all out of this and that \" how do you advertise a new avocado drink and not have avocados . So I waited forever , got attitude and no smile , then sorry we out of this ... I guess I should just be happy when I think there open to find out there really closed and save my money my time and patience . I really hope they get it right . This location went through same things in 2009 and it's closed for a few years before it re opened last year ."}
{"text":"I come to this location on occasion, usually around 5am on a weekend. Today I came at 10:50am on a Wednesday. When I first walked in the young man making smoothies behind a wall of cups looked me dead in the eye but never greeted me. After standing there for 4 minutes a young lady came out of the back with sandwiches. She greeted me and said she would be right with me. Another 5 minutes went by before the young man came from behind his wall and took my order. 

I have to say that I am very disappointed in this interaction. I've been to many Tropical Smoothies and not one has never NOT greeted me or at least acknowledged my presence. They did not appear to be super busy however they did seem to have a large order they were making. I realize this may seem a little nit-picky but I am in the hospitality business and I am a strong believer that customer service can make, or break, an experience. I will most likely be driving out of my way to a different location from now on."}
{"text":"Ok where to start? The smoothie I had was sunrise sunset with Splenda and it was really good. I got protein in it too so I essentially had it for lunch. Not bad at 260 calories for the whole thing!
However they don't have many other healthy options including the wraps and salads with all the extras thrown in. They have low carb but they weren't sure if it was wheat. The people at the register weren't very friendly or patiEnt as they answered my questions but seemed to be rushing me and getting frustrated with my questions. I'd be surprised if nobody else ever asked any questions...."}
{"text":"This is a great place to meet pissed off patrons! Here is the deal, I went to a nearby tropical smoothie café before this one because they had a drive thru. After waiting 15min in the drive thru, myself and 3 other customers reversed our cars, parked and went inside. No apology or explanation just a bunch of teens with no one managing them. So I left and went to this tropical smoothie café. I met 3 other highly agitated customers. After a long wait, I got my average tasting smoothies and left. I hope to never return."}
{"text":"I work right down the street from this TS and come here often for lunch. Unfortunately this location is going down hill and it just keeps getting worse. Every time I go, I always have to make sure I have an extra 20-30 minutes to wait for my food. There are never enough employees working. And a lot of times the employees seem like they are \"too cool\" to be working there. I will still come back for smoothies every so often, but it's just not a first choice anymore for lunchtime. The wait is too long and the service is terrible most times."}
{"text":"Ive been coming to this location again for a few weeks now and the staff and service has improved incredibly! The staff who works at night is great, the two girls i usually see there are always quick, and have amazing customer service. Props to the management for finally getting a full staff of great employees."}
{"text":"The smoothies are good, but they're always out of something ( protein, cups, lids) etc.."}
{"text":"The employees here obviously don't want to be at work. They don't greet you at all. I waited almost ten minutes for my order to be taken and there was no line and no apologies for the wait. An employee walked in to work and finally took our order. The other employees never acknowledged us. The service here is not reflective of the other tropical smoothie locations I've been to. This one is consistently bad. The service sucks and the smoothies don't taste as good."}
{"text":"A couple of months ago we got the flier advertising the opening of this place up on Camelback and 16th, and determined we'd like to try it, but hadn't gotten around to it until tonight. Definitely worth the wait! We ordered a sandwich and a flatbread, and both were superb!  We agreed we have to come back and try some other delicious-looking menu items, as well as some of those smoothies!

Service was quick and friendly, the music was good, the place, although small, was cool and comfortable (on this 115-degree day!). 

Terrific place for a cool, light dinner."}
{"text":"I have already left a horrible post on this before, but once again i placed an order paid then they said 10 min i go back at 10 min still not ready, i come back another 10 min later and they tell me my food is heating up, i also had stated NO TOMATOES as they make me very sick. i get my food take a bite and guess what TOMATOES. oh and the manager on shift was making comments on \" thats what she said.\" this place needs new management and new staff or close it down."}
{"text":"We have been customers of this chain for 5 years and love their food and smoothies. 

This particular location is relatively new (less than a year old currently) and in an extremely busy location.  Becuase of this the staffing levels are sporadic on the weekends and sometimes there is a 20 min wait for food. Generally it is les than 5. 

While the food and smoothies are great the cleanliness of this location is always an issue. In particular, the bathrooms are never cleaned properly. I have three young children and I honestly don't even let them use it unless it's an absolute emergency. 

It's very disappointing because the staff is nice and the manager seems to be capable. I don't know how the single bathrooms gets overlooked so often. 

Otherwise a favorite of our family. We are here several times a week."}
{"text":"Walked to this place from being at the dealership. So it was convenient. 
The smoothies are reasonably priced as well as the kids menu. What had me cringing was the smell as soon as I walked in. Thankfully I was in and out. The floors were seriously dirty including the floors behind the counter which to me is just as important! I am now questioning the cleanliness of The employee, and manager because the store's cleanliness is not up to par. 
Most likely won't be back."}
{"text":"This Tropical Smoothie Cafe, has got to be the WORST  I have ever visited. I would have actually given them a zero,had that been an option.Their customer service has a lot to be desired. (Does not exist ) There is NEVER anyone at the front to greet customers, There was no one inside but me placing an order, and it took at least 10 minutes before my order was taken. I can seriously go on and on with the lack of customer service, but I would be on here all day ! And not to mention the appearance of the staff ! Long story short,I will NOT be going back. We all have choices, and I choose to give my money where I feel like I matter. And This Tropical Smoothie Cafe,is NOT the spot."}
{"text":"Tropical Smoothie hit it right in the money with their new avocolada! It just has everything that I like, avocado, pineapple, coconut, spinach, and kale. I could not ask for a perfection of a smoothie. I have become quite an addict and I tend to stop by for one at least 3x a week. I have even gotten my co worker addicted as well and we just rave about how good it is. I really hope they keep it on the menu and it's not just seasonal. If you haven't tried it then I suggest you do."}
{"text":"I have gone a few times they always get my order wrong, today I go and I ordered a southwest chicken salad I got home and I didn't have chicken and my salad was half of what I usually get from the one off Cheyenne."}
{"text":"My smoothie was very good, but the drive thru customer service was not very good. I ordered my first smoothie and as soon as I said the name of the smoothie the person said is that all? I said no I'd like to add supplements. After I said the supplements she said is that all? I said no I'd like a second smoothie and said the name of the smoothie. She again said is that all and I again said no I'd like to add supplements.  The order would'nt have taken so long for 2 smoothies if she'd just let me talk.  The drive thru was also not a very fast option. We were probably waiting 15-20 minutes with one car ahead of us for our 2 smoothies. I gave a 3 only because of the taste of our smoothies."}
{"text":"We had lunch here yesterday.  My husband had a sandwich and a coffee smoothie and I had a fruit smoothie (which was plenty filling for me).  I tasted my hubby's lunch and it was good, good enough for him to finish it all.  My smoothie was also yummy, but it would have been nice to have size/price options because I didn't finish mine (I was too full) and so it was a bit of a waste.

Overall a good option if you're in the casino and need a speedy good for you lunch."}
{"text":"Store is a mess, crates and boxes in kitchen and customer area. Ordered on line, still waited 20 minutes after I got there and the store wasn't busy
 After all of that, smoothie was made incorrectly.  Won't be going back to this location."}
{"text":"I sat in the drive thru for 45 mins to get two smoothies. They are super slow! Obviously the owner and the mangers have no idea what the hell they are doing. For hiring sloths"}
{"text":"Just an update: I contacted their corporate headquarters on 12/30/17 and they didn't even have the common decency to respond back in any way.  There you have it folks.  A terrible organization from top to bottom.  

Good heavens, all these reviews about the service are spot on.  Who is running the show at this place?  Does this franchise have regional managers?  If so, they need to be fired.  The store manager here needs to be fired.  Came in today at 2 pm and one poor girl was working the whole store.  It took me 30 minutes to get one smoothie.  I had to change what I wanted because the girl basically pleaded with me not to order the Blimey Limey.  Apparently, she would have to stop everything and juice the limes.  I obliged.

Here is the biggest issue.  The girl was handling money without gloves on, then she was making food.  She did this over and over without washing her hands once.  In addition, juice and fruit were left out.  This place would be shut down if a health inspector showed up.

Welp, I am done with this company for a long while.  I might reconsider after a year or so of improved reviews. 

This is not my fist bad experience.  Last week I came in and their oven was broken.  The back area is also filthy.

If you are looking for a quick new year's health plan this place might be for you.  Come enough and you will be certain to get food poisoning."}
{"text":"This place does not make a good smoothie, it is watered down and little fruit. I wanted them to redo it and they did, but it's still very bad. I would not recommend if you want a tasty smoothie"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.... we didn't even try the food or drinks. We came in a little after 4 pm on a Sunday.  About 4 customers sitting and 2 people ahead of us in line. Another couple walked in right behind us.  3 employees working behind the counter.  The guy at the register was speaking to the 2 people ahead of us. They didn't even place their order- they just walked out. As soon as we approached the counter, the guy didn't even make eye contact.  He just walked away. We stood there for a good 2 minutes and realized that NONE of the employees acknowledged us.  We just walked out.  I'm not going to spend my money at an establishment that treats their customers like that. 

Customer service 101- acknowledge your customers!!!!"}
{"text":"From 3/19/16
Came into Tropical Smoothie for lunch and to get something refreshing to drink. This place has a great variety of wraps and sandwiches, fruit and of course, smoothies-duh! I got the Avacado smoothie which was filling enough for me and tasty."}
{"text":"Omg..this place really pissed me off..it took more than 15 minutes before they took our order..than another 20 minutes at the window..the woman behind us asked if we would let her out cause it had been so long..so we left she left and the car behind her left..more than 30 minutes in drive thru is RIDICULOUS!!!!"}
{"text":"This is my second time going to this location and both time were horrible.  The first time my smoothie tasted watered down.  This time there were big chunks of peanut butter at the bottom of the cup. Poor service and quality."}
{"text":"too lazy to read: scroll to the bottom

i'm not exactly sure why my previous review from YEARS ago was deleted but basically i'm going to say the same thing as everyone else and i hope MANAGEMENT reads this and actually LISTENS to what the people are saying. 
from a manager to another manager: HIRE another person or 2 to be on shift at a time. and reconsider your employees because this all feels like it's a bother to them. at first when i walked in the lady seemed nice but busy, didn't take my order until 10 minutes after i got there because she was getting other people's orders. okay, no problem i understand. but when i finally got to making my order, she gives me attitude over making food. like ??? i should've just said nvm and walked away, to jamba juice or something. absolutely pathetic if you think cutting down on costs by not having enough employees will bring you more revenue. i wasn't trying to come here but i left it as a last resort. i'm writing this immediately after making my order by the way. ridiculous this location has been like this for years. 


too long didn't read: don't come here. understaffed, and rude customer service. expect to be here for more than half an hour."}
{"text":"service sucks . workers are rude . they cant handle fast paced environment . drive thru took THIRTY MINUTES , and only 2 cars were in front of me . i had an appointment and missed my appointment , had ti pay $25 to reschedule because i had to sit , trapped , in the drive thru . and they acted like they did nothing wrong ."}
{"text":"So so so slow.  Been in drive thru for 30 minutes.  With two cars in front of me.  Avoid this place at all costs if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"This location is literally the shittiest all around. Worst customer service, horrible food prep, and the wait time is ridiculous! 

I order my usual spinach and feta wrap and they never have feta sauce. So I choose the two other options and they don't have the complete ingredients either! And my, the wait time is God-awful! Every time I come here I hope that there is a change in management! But fails me every time! 
The drive through takes a good thirty minutes! The workers are a bitch too!"}
{"text":"So, I stopped by this place three times and all three times they've been out of food. Literally out of all food. It's a joke of a restaurant. Don't waste your time. Even if all you want is a smoothie, be prepared to wait 10 minutes for it as the employees have more important things to do... like text with their friends on their cell phone or just stare at you while you're trying to find someone to take your money for their product. Skip at all costs and hope to God this place finally shuts down soon."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would! Worst service ever!!! I walk in on 9am on a Saturday no one in this place. There are 2 employees working the drive thru only. We walk in and stand in front of the counter for I kid you not over 5 minutes and No One even acknowledges us. The employees do not even look at us for the 5-10 minutes. I even use the restroom come back and still stand in front of the counter. Still no acknowledgement at all. I had to ask the employees if they are open and then was the only time I was acknowledged. Would not go back here for bad service alone we left without purchasing anything. Maybe unhappy employees are not the best people to have working your stores. Maybe Torrey and Jakeikia should not be working if they are not customer friendly. Especially after leaving that Jakeikia stayed that \"she did not give give a shit\". This is not an exaggeration. Please do not go there."}
{"text":"Horrible service&quality. Cashier was super slow and not professional at all. With no one in the shop, still waited 5 mins for a sandwich. Also she forgot my sides, after I asked, she gave me 1/4 of a cup of kale&apple slaw. Really??? 
If not for the location, I would NEVER come here ever again."}
{"text":"It's been some time since I last been here and looks like it's been remodeled. Feels a bit more spacious with this current set up. I remember it being somewhat crammed last time I was there. It looks like they are trying to go for a more colorful or vibrant presentation with the colored stools and chairs. But on the other wall (not pictured) there was only one poster upon a plain white wall.

I came in around 8:30/8:45pm and it was empty. It was just one worker in the front and from what I could tell one in the back. Apparently their system was down at that time. I wanted to scan the bar code on my phone for the Tropical Smoothie rewards program but was out of luck.
My Muscle Blaster drink was made in a timely manner and tasted as expected.

A woman came in to pick up her online order. The worker also told her the system was down and had to scramble to get the order taken down and worked on. Not sure how the payment was resolved as I had to head out and was on my way out the door.

Hopefully the system will be working for anyone who uses their Tropical Smoothie rewards program app and/or orders online."}
{"text":"LOVE tropical smoothie but this one in particular has the worst customer service I have ever had!!!

Whomever the cashier was sucked so bad!! It was Charlotte or something with a CH but was a guy! He got me a wrap that I specifically asked no ham.... Opened it and it had ham. Then he forgot to give me potato salad that came with it so I had to remind him... Then he forgot the fork as well. He knew he screwed up so bad he gave me a free smoothie card. Did I mention that while he was taking my order he took about 15 minutes and screwed up the entire thing!!! I will never ever go here again."}
{"text":"This was literally the worst experience and I've had bad experiences. I went on a Friday a few weeks ago and there was one girl ringing up and another making the stuff. There was a long line considering it was busy. Finally after waiting forever it was my turn. As I went up the girl walked away and starts taking to some guy who came right to the counter. She then starts asking him his order and then kissed him as the entire line is staring. There was quite a few people in line too. So she just completely ignored us and went to speak to her boyfriend who she put an order in for yet didn't make him pay??? When she had paying customers standing there watching this. It was appalling to know that someone would do that when they are suppose to be doing there job. 

Finally got my smoothies and food and I get in the car and took out the wrap I got (the peanut butter and banana one) and I get a wrap with chunks of granola. It was disgusting that isn't how it's suppose to be made. I'm so disappointed and won't ever come again."}
{"text":"This place needs to hire real managers. Walked in around 230pm, zero customers, 5 workers, all teenagers. Trash all over the floor, found a chair without food on it my 3rd try. One guy started to bag up all the trash. Another costumer walked in. He took her order and card, never washed his hands. Mind you, 3 others were available to do this. They were busy gossiping with each other around my sandwiches we're being made. Food was better than mediocre compared to other juice spots."}
{"text":"This cute little smoothie shop is truly like an oasis in a desert. It's right down the street from my house and across from my work and one day my husband and I just decided to give it a whirl. We were NOT disappointed! They have a massive menu and a huge selection that is sure to satisfy any fruit lovers taste buds. They currently have a flavor called the 'Avocalada' that is a limited time flavor but HOLY MOLY it's utterly delicious! My husband and I both ordered smoothies and wraps and sat in to enjoy our decadent lunch together. The employees were very nice to us and even gave us extra chips! How cool is that?! I highly recommend this place.

To the people complaining about the wait...everything here is handmade and the portions are generous. It does get busy and have it's rushes at certain times of the day so if you don't have time to wait, I'd recommend waiting until after work. Like any place, the service you receive is (generally) a reflection of your own attitude. Give this place a try if you're in the area, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"I understand it's under reservation but this place was disgusting. Bathroom was filthy, toilets not flushed, sinks gross, trash everywhere. Behind the kitchen was gross too, girls on the phone be unpleasant. Smoothie was good but a little grossed out."}
{"text":"This place is so slow!!!! I placed my order and the young girl didn't start to make it until 15 min later. 1 person working only! The cashier decided to stand for 15 min in front of the register waiting for the next customer to decide on what they were going to order. Then she rung up the customer wrong and tried to void it out but didn't know how! She should have started our smoothies while the customers decided and help me first! Finally got our smoothies 30 min later!!!"}
{"text":"My only complaint with this tropical smoothie is the customer service. Customer service is the most important part about running a food service business. It's the only thing makes me want to come back, and it's a shame the one closest the my house brings no smiles or joy to my day. Every time I come in it's like none of the workers even want to be there. I honestly believed none of them were trained in basic customer service. If I'm waiting to order I get no acknowledgement that they'll be right with me. When they finally come on the counter, I go out of my way to ask them how they are, because working in customer service I know how far that goes, and I just get a \"good\". No \"how are you back\" or not even a \"what can I get for you\" they just stare at the register waiting. How am I supposed to know you're ready for me? I recommend to management that they train the employees better customer service because you won't receive repeat customers. As for me, I'm going to go out of my way to go to a better tropical smoothie that has customer service."}
{"text":"I have been to many Tropical Smoothies around town and had a pleasant experience with those locations.  This Tropical Smoothie was a horrible experience.  I was stuck in the drive thru line for almost 30 minutes, and once I got to the window finally, my food and smoothie was still not ready, so I had to wait another 15 minutes.  The cherry on top moment was when they screwed up my order.  As I was waiting in line I saw no one walk-in or walk out, so the place was empty.  There was no excuse for this wait.  If you want to eat healthy, just go to Subway."}
{"text":"Once again they increased the price of the smoothies.
They did it last year and just a week ago they did it again. I'm a long time regular, I know their staff and love thier food but I just can't support this chain anymore. The price itself isn't the issue to me it's the greed behind it. If they gave a decent  reason like increasing the sizes or the amount of fruit that goes into the smoothie but nope they just want more money. I originally paid $6.99 for a smoothie and flat bread wrap, now I'm paying close to $9."}
{"text":"I got a coupon in the saying your 24hours !!!
After a long drive to your location i was very upset to find you closed !!"}
{"text":"One day each week on my bicycle commute to work I allow myself the privilege of a mocha madness with added whey protein. It never fails to be a delicious treat! This place is virtually unknown but it's really good."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Drinks are inconsistent, waited in line for 10 minutes. Nobody acknowledged me. Walked out and left. If they have a manager they should get a new one."}
{"text":"Like all franchise smoothie businesses you expect the same tasting smoothies around the nation with little change in decor.

That's what you can expect at tropical smoothie, however the difference is the staff. Seriously this location has Horrible Customer service. I waited for 10 minutes with no one else in the Resteraunt while all the employees looked at me and continued \"working\" in the back. They said \"be right with you\" yet the jokes and laughed and wipes cutting boards down. Iam a small business owner, your customers come first. The owner needs to clean shop and hire better employees. This waiting time and lack of desire to provide good quality food service is crazy!"}
{"text":"If I could zero stars I would, I was so excited when this location so close to my home opened. 
Every time I'm here the staff look unhappy and the smoothies don't taste up to par. 
I came today and there was only one other person in the building and the staff member didn't even look at me or greet me, after standing at the counter for ten minutes of still not being greeted or told I would helped shortly, I left. I'll spend my money elsewhere.
Don't co.e to this location, its HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"They're okay smoothies. I found some chunks of veggies in my drink but on the plus side you can tell they use real produces."}
{"text":"The food and smoothies here are great. The manager needs some help and coaching. I've been there several times. They've either been out of something or the oven down. Dylan, one of the employees always apologizes and tries to work fast even being understaffed as it seems.

Recently, I walked in and the employee was talking with his manager in what seemed to be a heated conversation about hours. I waited for 5 -10 minutes and then was helped. I walked to starbucks during the time my food was being made, as a thought. When I came back, I was told that they forgot about my order and got sidetracked talking about policies and procedures. The manager, Andrea, defended the employee and said My food wasn't made because they had to have a conversation about policies and procedures. I was the only customer there during this entire time. The manager seemed defensive until I explained how unprofessional the entire situation appeared to be.

Anyhow, there is one on camelback which I hear has great customer service and of course the food is great! Hoping the staff and management can get their \"policies and procedures\" worked out at this location and hoping customer service \"policies and procedures\" are talked about at some point."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a cool drink on a hot day with my son -- fantastic! Fresh fruit was blended up just right -- not too sweet, a bit tangy, and didn't blow the diet. 

The gal who helped us was friendly -- answered our questions politely and whipped up our treats in a snap. 

Just over 10-dollars for two drinks -- so it's not something we would do every day, but we thought these smoothies were better than the other franchise \"juice\" ones... and we will certainly be visiting Tropical Smoothie Cafe again soon!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place!!! Can't say enough good things!! The smoothies are so addicting!! The people are always friendly and smiling!! Love it"}
{"text":"Worst customer service. They generally take a long time to give you your order, but today was even worse. I was in the drive thru, payed with card and was waiting for the girl (long dark, straight hair) to give me my smoothie and take her clipboard back. My smoothie sat by the window for 5 minutes before she actually paid attention to me again. Her and 3 other employees were clearly there, goofing around with each other and carrying on their own conversations. She even looked at me waiting and looked away. Don't go here unless you want annoying customer service and melted smoothies."}
{"text":"Get the Paradise Point, it will change your life. I can't come to tropical smoothie and not get the paradise point. The have salads, wraps and tacos as well. I've never tried but my friends seem to like the tacos a lot. I'm a regular here and will continue to be throughout the summer!"}
{"text":"Ehhhhh.........it was ok. I found my smoothie to be a little lack luster. It was a green detox something. I did poop quite a bit later that afternoon, so I guess it did it's job. It worked!  Just the taste was a bit on the bland side."}
{"text":"My favorite smoothie chains. They're open 24 hours which is great. I love the cranberry walnut sandwich and the health nut smoothie. I could eat here everyday."}
{"text":"Ugh these people have the worst customer service and are sooooo slow. Consistently I walk through the door and it takes at least 3 minutes for someone to even greet me, then another few more minutes until someone takes my order, and again another 15 minutes for a smoothie and sandwich. I tried asking for a cup water while I waited and that itself took 5 minutes. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Every time I come in there's a new person working and worse than the previous person. I order the same thing every time and every time my order comes out different. My last visit I placed an online order for pick up for a smoothie and wrap. When I came in my smoothie was ready but they somehow didn't see a had a wrap too. They went and made my wrap (Hummus veggie w/ chicken) and right away I assumed they missed that I added chicken, and i was right. Ended up paying more for less, didn't even bother coming back to correct it because they're always in the weeds. 
Update 5/28: Ordered the same thing online once again and once again they didn't add chicken. It's like these kids don't even bother reading the orders. Really hope they shut this place down and put something better in its place."}
{"text":"Love coming to this place but not if the staff is rude. Brianna, fat shaming people won't make you look or feel any better! Won't be visiting this location again unless I know she is no longer working there."}
{"text":"This used to be a good place to go, but the quality of food and service has deteriorated significantly. Tonight in the drive thru I ordered a chicken salad sandwich. They gave me half a sandwich and there was barely any chicken salad on the sandwich. They tried to cover this up by adding a lot of spinach. When I complained, they said I had ordered half a sandwich to which I said no I did not. Then they didn't understand I was also upset about the quality of the serving and amount of chicken salad. They didn't apologize, instead these young boys showed me their 'recipe card' to explain to me the ingredients in the sandwich. They did not comprehend that I wanted what I had ordered and wanted to get a sandwich like I used to get from this place. Their solution was for me to come back three days later and they would make me something. No apology, no offer to fix the problem. In addition to this, I watched them make the smoothies. They are 20% canned fruit and 80% ice. Not worth the money. This place is just a rip off and management doesn't even seem to care, as the many bad reviews show."}
{"text":"First time in a Tropical Smoothie. I was there to buy a gift card. I was wondering how the place could have gotten 2 stars. I can understand now. The place looks old and maybe not super clean. They ran out of giftcards so I neither got a card nor a drink. The senior staff was polite though, so that is why the two stars. No second chances Tropical Smoothie."}
{"text":"She had gloves on, then touched my money, then touched everything to make my PB Choc Luv smoothie.... then handed me my smoothie and said \"I can make you another one if you want to wait\" to which I replied \"why, what's wrong with this one?\" She said \"sometimes the peanut butter recipes come up short\" pointing at the cup which was indeed about 2oz short but hardly enough to say anything about it. Interesting experience. And management could use to remind ppl what the gloves are for."}
{"text":"Can we give zero stars? How about negative stars? Worst establishment EVER!! Kids work here. Kids that have no clue what they offer on the menu or how to make it. They walk around like zombies and act like customers bother them. Never polite. It took over 30 minutes just now to get 3 smoothies. Read that again. I will NEVER GO BACK!!"}
{"text":"Only one employee working on a Saturday morning? The place is busy enough for 3 to be here. The manager needs to pull his head out of his rear end and hire people! The one person working gave a valiant effort."}
{"text":"Giving this place 2 stars due to the smoothies being delicious. The downside to this place is their customer service. You will never never ever be greeted or find someone at the register. They will let you stand for over 7 minutes without ever saying I will be right there.  Tonight a young lady with dark hair and a blonde streak with glasses seemed to be in a bad mood. She was the worst to deal with here ever and that says a lot since the majority of the staff are also inexperienced. End result, you will enjoy the smoothie on your way out of there but will never wall out happy.."}
{"text":"We were on your way furniture shopping when we came upon this place.  I used to go to the one by my house for their awesome smoothies and wraps, but they closed.  My little cutie pie was starving after spending the whole morning at a pumpkin patch.  

Tropical Smoothies are a notch up from fast food restaurants.  We settled on the Turkey Bacon Ciabatta, which was a fairly good size, so my little cutie pie and I split that.  I was disappointed that they used the microwave to heat up the bacon.   Hubby went with the Peanut Butter Smoothie and a Chicken Wrap.     

We came here on a slow Sunday;  I just wished they'd clean the place more.  Dust accumulating on the window sill along with the foodstuff on the floor should be regularly cleaned and wiped down.  If it were a bicycle shop or antique store, it would have been okay.   But, this is a restaurant and people eat here!   Just my pet peeve.

Not too bad."}
{"text":"Great place, great service! Top smoothie cafe in vegas."}
{"text":"I have been to several tropical smoothie locations hoping this one would be as great as the rest (since I never had a doubt that it wouldn't be!) it was such a disappointment. The front of the store was so extremely dirty it made me question how the back of the store, where food & smoothies are being prepared looked. I have worked in many food industries & this would NEVER fly at any place I have ever worked at. Not okay, & I will not be back at this location."}
{"text":"Worst experience I have ever had at tropical smoothie by far. My one smoothie was pretty much melted by the time they brought them out and the 2nd one tasted like water. When I told them they took there time replacing it to the point where my other smoothie was completely melted at that point"}
{"text":"My friend and I were there this afternoon at 6 PM May 25, 2017 we ordered cranberry pecan chicken salad sandwiches barbecue chips and water
My sandwich was not fresh the bread was stale it had chopped apples no Pecans. They had no barbecue chips even though they were displaying them they only had one salt and vinegar chips and they had no bottled water of any kind. 
The beverage cabinet at the front by the register was completely empty
The only good thing about this meal is I ordered a peanut butter smoothie and that one was fine. 
My friend ordered the same sandwich that I did instead she was delivered and Apple turkey sandwich that was very dry. No chips we had to go after the chips and they had no water and no napkins with our meal or on the table. 
The only beverage they were offering was soda, and smoothies. 
I definitely will never return to this topic and a smoothie's café"}
{"text":"Very busy, slow workers & only one cash register open - furniture inside extremely unstable, felt unsafe."}
{"text":"Extremely bad service on this location. Seriously almost 20 min to get a smoothie. The cashier took about 6 orders in a row and proceeded to start making the smoothies afterwards. Super short staffed and unbelievable bad service."}
{"text":"I've been to many different TSC locations but this has to be my least favorite one that I've ever been to. Now let me explain why.

The customer service is absolutely appalling. They're severely understaffed which causes long lines, insanely long wait times, and lackluster smoothies. 

Every other TSC I've gone to has at LEAST 6 people working at once, cranking out items like there's no tomorrow. This one, on the other hand, is usually a ghost town and it's pretty obvious why. I stopped here on my way to work and placed an online order to ensure that I wasn't late. I walk in a few mins after my expected completed time and my smoothies weren't even started! The lady made the woman's smoothie order in front of me (4 smoothies) before she even started mine, which made me late for work.

On top of that, I received no apology. AND the smoothie was so much more sweet than I've ever had before. It was terrible!

If you want TSC, do not go to this location. There's a reason why it's not even 25% as busy as all the other locations."}
{"text":"Great smoothies made with fresh fruits.
I love the blimey limey smoothie with less real sugar!!! Pineapple orange juice lime and strawberries - very refreshing.
The other ones I like are the Margo Magic and the strawberry/banana smoothies :)
I don't care for their wrap of their sandwiches.
My coworker downloaded their apps and order everything on line for pick up (just a suggestion)
He said I get some discounts after some orders placed online :)"}
{"text":"They always forget the peanut butter !!! So if you get a drink with it check before you leave."}
{"text":"The smoothies at this location are always good, I've never gone inside...I always use drive thru, decent customer service my only complaint is the drive thru is slower than slow the management should properly staff the store and set a standard for getting cars in and out of drive thru"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location. I had a great experience, the staff was really nice and my order was ready pretty quick. I love the smoothies. Perfect place to stop by after a killer workout. Reboot, refreshed, real yummy."}
{"text":"Stop by every now and then to grab a smoothie. They are very good. I'm a big smoothie fan. Also like their wraps and sandwiches. Best smoothie the acai smoothie."}
{"text":"I love spending 30 minutes in the drive thru! Just to get my order wrong! If anyone can suggest a better run store, I'd appreciate it. It's obvious that the proverbial monkeys run the zoo here!"}
{"text":"Awful customer service. They're rude & extremely slow. The store inside is very dirty & looks terrible. They also don't seem to know to make any smoothie. 
A lot of other reviews seem to have the same complaints, you would think they would fix them. But apparently no one cares."}
{"text":"Always friendly faces when I walk in. Great customer service and amazing smoothies and good food brought to me in record time. Love being a customer at this location!"}
{"text":"-from my prior visit I was extremely unsatisfied...I always order the orange dream and they at least had the curtesy to tell me they were out of white chocolate but today, Tuesday 2:40, they didn't tell me they were out of carrots for the smoothie and I walked away with a GOD AWFUL smoothie. So I went back in and got a jetty punch and all they said was \"it tastes bad because we're out of carrots\". I've been here multiple times and the employees are rude and the turnover rate is apparent, no on knows how to give change back correctly nor do they know how to make a smoothie. AVOID THIS LOCATION AT ALL COSTS!"}
{"text":"Went in Wednesday July 5th around 9:30, the girl seemed like she was dreading to be there."}
{"text":"Open late and healthier choices when not wanting fast food. Has a drive thru which is super convenient"}
{"text":"I have to agree with everyone else on how slow the drive thru is... I've waited up to 10 or 15 minutes with only 1 or 2 cars ahead. 5 minutes if it's just me... The smoothies and food are decent but get the pasta salad as the side because the fruit salad is a pathetic scoop of 2 grapes cut in half and a Tbsp of canned pineapple. 

Update: today I found a few pieces of plastic in my smoothie...."}
{"text":"Went here today after my work out at LVAC, which I'm pretty sure alot of people do. The wait time at drive thru was insane!! Almost HALF AN HOUR just to get to the intercom which my order only took 2 mins to place then another half an hour to actual get to the window. Best part is my smoothie was ready BUT NOT MY FOOD! I'm sorry if I'm waiting HALF AN HOUR and it's a SANDWICH my food better be warm or something but NOPE!! It looked like a 3 year old made my food!! This location in customer service and quality has went down tremendously!! They seriously need better management!!"}
{"text":"So the owner was very nice to email me about my disappointment with her cafe, she wanted to invite me back with offer of a free smoothie. I went to redeem it today. So thankful for the customer service she had made by emailing me, that I went back to her cafe to get my smoothies. To top it all, her associate Kait was super nice... Greeted me right away and made my smoothie right away while I was still talking with the cashier. Kait also walked my smoothie over and thank for me coming in, she didnt even know that I was there for a specific reason, now that's the ultimate customer service!!"}
{"text":"Heads up this owner does not except yelp discount. 
The girl who made smoothie running things in back was very nice."}
{"text":"Subpar service. Other locations are better and actually notice when a customer is ready to take their order. Also very lackadaisical with this location."}
{"text":"I've never given a one star review. But this was the worst Tropical Smoothie Cafe experience. They were barely busy on a Saturday afternoon (four customers) so I was patient and expected my Detox Island Green to be fine, but when it came out it was incredibly chunky. I got a big piece of ginger in the first sip. Not pleasant whatsoever. 
Neither was the girl that was at the counter, I watched her take the customers after me and she said \"hi\" reluctantly and with a straight face and just stared at them while they both recited their orders and then swiped the card and threw down the receipt for them to sign. 
I get it. You're young, it's Saturday and you'd rather be anywhere else, but you have a job, do it. And learn how to not only give good customer service but just have common courtesy or else you have no business working anywhere."}
{"text":"The food was decent, typical food court style, so the following review has more to do with the staff. However, the sandwich was lukewarm and the drink was a bit icier than the normal consistency. 

The WORST customer service. The staff member at the counter was rude, unprofessional, and incredibly unorganized. I waited 10 minutes to actually place my order. There was a lady who came after me to pick up an order which she had ordered  earlier, the man had her go in front of me to ring her up first, even though I had been waiting 10 minutes to simply place my order. 

After FINALLY placing my order, I went back to my seat not far from the vendor. When my name was called, the man in the front rudely informed me that he had called me 5 times. I apologized letting him know that I had not heard him. As someone who has worked in retail, the CUSTOMER NEVER SHOULD APOLOGIZE. I am also not sure that this is the correct smothie that I ordered, as I was trying a new one and it is a lot sweeter than I would think their veggie would be, however I am not certain. I wish I had this person's name, however whoever this person is SHOULD NEVER BE THE FACE OF A COMPANY. 

For the managerial staff, whoever was working the counter at 12pm on Tuesday, January 2015 should be reconsidered as a staff person, if not completely let go. Definitely will not be a returning customer."}
{"text":"I love the smoothies and the sandwiches but the service is so bad. I understand it's run by teenagers who have no concept of customer service and time. I'm allergic to tomatoes so I always order my sandwiches without tomatoes. One time, my sandwich came with tomatoes. The kid was apologetic and brought back a new sandwich. I ate it and started feeling funny. I opened my sandwich and saw tomato seeds on it! They just removed it instead of making a brand new one for me. One other time, my sister and I went through the drive thru, our smoothies didnt come out until 15 minutes later. No apology for the wait from the kid."}
{"text":"This location is horribly dirty! Our 1st time wasn't that bad but today (Sunday) is from the tables to the floor. Most disgustingly is the bathroom, thought we might get sick by walking in there. One positive thing tho, we love seeing teens working after school and always support them; however, the store manager should be more responsible and on top of the cleanliness!"}
{"text":"Nice energetic young staff. Friendly and helpful manager. Quick service. Food and smoothie were delicious as always. So happy there's finally a TS near home now"}
{"text":"Service was HORRIBLE!! No greeting no thank you, 3 women in the back just talking and laughing with 5 people waiting in line for one of them to take out order. On top of it all the smoothie was horrible watered down. I absolutely hated just spending $7 on HORRIFIC service and a nasty smoothie. NEVER EVER going to this location!!"}
{"text":"Not the cleanest place i seen today the girl working is dirty as hell looks like she has slippers on and her shirt had grease stains on it and food stains too the floor is dirty dirty and the bathroom is grows but in her defense shes the only one working and god knows how many hours she been on it but still management should have more help.  Plus she's eating as she makes the smoothies!! Ew!"}
{"text":"The smoothies are great but this shop is agonizingly slow!

I've come in here during off-peak hours hoping for a decent turn-around (under 10 minutes) to no avail.

I will not return again."}
{"text":"If i could i would give no stars because they don't deserve even 1.  We arrived at 6:27 in the drive through and they asked if we could hold.  We waited 10 minutes and the person taking our order tried to overcharge us, without giving us the discount for ordering a smoothie with our sandwiches, had we not questioned the $26... And its now 7:06 just receiving our order.  There was only one car in front of us, and looking in after we pulled out, there was no one inside.  Granted the same person taking the order made our 2 smoothies and sandwich and wrap, but with only one car behind us, that's ridiculous.  Close the drive through and hire more workers please.  Not worth the $23 we paid."}
{"text":"Great deals great food! Huge smoothie for a very hot day. I got Health nut and it didn't taste \"healthy\" it was very berry/tropical tasting. Love it. It had a chill but bright vibe! The girls there were very helpful and friendly. Our food came out super fast."}
{"text":"Most tropical smoothies take forever, not this one. Got a Acai smoothie and a Thai chicken salad and it was super yummy. The staff was super friendly. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Don't ever go here unless you have at least 15-20 minutes.  Lunch time on a Saturday and one person is running the whole shop."}
{"text":"Every single time I come here the drive thru takes about 20 minutes and they get my order wrong or mess something up just about every time. Yesterday I was in the drive thru for 28 minutes and there was only 1 car ahead of us when we arrived. They took my entire order and 15 minutes later when I got to the window and they finally opened it to speak to me they let me know they didn't have the main ingredient that goes in 2 of the wraps I ordered. At this point I had been there for 20 minutes already and my baby was crying in the backseat so I just said fine and took the wraps without the main ingredient. Even doing that it still took 10 more minutes before they came back to the window with my food. The employees are nice but honestly frustrating to deal with. They seem very unorganized and unprofessional with the way they speak to the customer and the way they leave you sitting in the window without being addresses or greeted for 10 minutes or more when you pull up. The worst part about it is when we finally got our smoothies they were watery and had very little flavor. This has happened multiple times before (we frequent other locations and always order the same flavor  so we know how they should taste) but yesterday I just didn't have the time or the patience to go back and have them re-made. Overall this location more often than not is a frustrating and time consuming experience which is unfortunate since it is the most convenient location for us and our family loves tropical smoothie normally"}
{"text":"Smoothies we chose were great and we got a lot for 5 bucks each, place is nice and quiet and sitting out front is relaxing!"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd Tropical Smoothie place I've been to in the past 2 days. I've always read the reviews at all the different locations about the bad customer service people have been receiving, but I haven't witnessed that experience. I pulled up to the drive thru, the young gentleman was very upbeat, smiled and has excellent customer service and did I mention, there were 2 cars in front of me and I was in and out in less than 5 minutes, that's service. Plus, I don't mind the prices, $4.99 for a 24oz smoothie.. Jamba Juice's 24oz are all over $5+ maybe $6 including tax. I also like the fact that they have a drive thru"}
{"text":"I always see this location, but I never stop in, the place looks rundown. But, I was craving something cold, went on Yelp, checked out their website and found that if you download their app on Google or Apple, you get a free $5 credit. I ended up ordering the new Watermelon Mojito Smoothie which is pretty good. I docked 1 star because there doesn't seem to be a scanner at the drive thru to scan the app on my phone, he literally took it and walked away, which was a little too weird for my liking. I'd go back to this location, it's so close to my job, anytime I crave a smoothie, I'll be there"}
{"text":"This place is the slllooooowest place on earth!!' I have been sting in line for 20 min and still haven't moved just for a damn smoothie!!"}
{"text":"Very poorly run.  One employee was making himself food, and another employee said she couldn't take my order because the system wouldn't let her clock in.  Yet late last night the only employee working was the only person on staff handling the drive thru and taking orders, he was completely over whelmed but handled customers the best way he could."}
{"text":"Shake was good but I waited over 30 minutes for one shake. They need to staff this place better."}
{"text":"Worst Tropical Smoothie location in Vegas. Every time I go, the wait is either 20 minutes or my smoothie taste like lemon water. It's like they completely disregard the menu and ingredients. I've also come here once when they had run out of cups.... cups! They gave me 6 tiny cups full of smoothie to make the one cup. Terrible. Officially done with this place."}
{"text":"It's really unfortunate how bad the Tropical Smoothies have gone down hill in Vegas. They are dirty and slow with employees that seem to not care at all about the business. These specific stores are disgusting. Eastern/Horizon Ridge, Charleston in Summerlin, and Blue Diamond near Mountains Edge. Never again. Looooove ****Carpe Diem on Blue Diamond.  So clean, yummy and friendly"}
{"text":"My husband and I stood at the register for over 10 minutes before anyone greeted us or took our order. When they finally came over to take our order they were very unapologetic. My husband asked for Splenda in both drinks and was asked if he didn't want turbinado(sp?), when he asked what that was the worker said she had no idea. When we finally got our drinks they were just left at the counter with no apology for the wait or thank you's. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Terrible Tropical Smoothie Cafe - should be closed down. They don't use the same ingredients as the other locations - everything is watered down and the texture is different. Teenagers run the place and are unprofessional. DO NOT GO HERE."}
{"text":"Girl at the counter was the saddest, most bored, job hating person ive come across in a restaurant. Poor thing."}
{"text":"Literally stood at the register for 13 mins while tevin (cashier) ignored us. Correction, he would stare at us, walk toward us and then walk away without a word. He always left the phone off the hook the entire time we were here. Of course he was very rude and took almost 15 mins to make two items."}
{"text":"This place is terrible at customer service! At least at night..... Every time I've come here, I'm always stuck waiting when there's only one person in front of me. There's no acknowledgement when we walk through the door. A simple \"I'll be with you in a minute\" would be enough. There's no sense of urgency and it seems like they're taking their sweet time making the smoothies while the line gets longer. If you're looking to get in and out within a matter of minutes, don't count on it."}
{"text":"I come here at least once a week. Being a smoothie addict and all... This is hands down my favorite place. My recent obsession is the Island Green. It's perfect with an added protein boost. I haven't ordered food here, but today I was feeling adventurous. The honey ham and Swiss flatbread smells wonderful. Can't wait to hey my hands on my order.

May I just say, there is only one girl working and she's holding down the fort. She's neglecting the phone a bit, but she has present customers. She had to make an order of importance decision. Good call smoothie woman, I applaud your choice!"}
{"text":"If I could do zero stars, I would. I have been waiting half an hour for 2 smoothies. No one in the lobby has received their smoothies either. There's only 2 individuals working and one is clearly new. There's not a problem with being new, but there needs to be an additional crew member scheduled to help him specifically. One individual was waiting so long that he straight up left without a refund because he was so frustrated. On top of this, 2 other customers left the line specifically due to the fact no one bothered to greet them at the register and acknowledge their presence. Not a well run establishment. Good smoothies, not worth the wait. This is insane."}
{"text":"The rice was not cooked at all in my Caribbean Jerk Wrap. Also very disappointed this location did not carry beyond chicken."}
{"text":"Inside the Green valley ranch casino. 

I love the Mango Magic, it's in the low calorie menu. Although the price is a bit higher than normal, it's still ok, since I love my Mango Magic. =)"}
{"text":"The avocolada is amazing!! Employees are always very helpful and good customer service too"}
{"text":"oH MAn!   

I wish there was one of these within a 10 minute walk from my work.      I WOULD LUNCH THERE SOO HARRRRD!!"}
{"text":"The smoothie and half chicken salad sandwhich combo was the best 8 bucks I've spent in a long time."}
{"text":"Lots of options including breakfast and smoothies. I got the health nut with the veggie protein. I thought the smoothie would be smaller, but it was big for the price! I'll for sure go back."}
{"text":"Two stars only because I love the smoothie! No watermelon and terrible service!! The only reason I drove out of my way on my 1 hour lunch break was for the watermelon mojito smoothie. When I walked in there was only one other person standing off to the side waiting on a smoothie and three workers. Nobody greeted me or even looked my way, I waited almost ten minutes before the cashier walked over to the register and stared at me, so I said hi and she said \"what\" very unfriendly! I asked for the watermelon mojito and she told me \"no watermelon\". She didn't say sorry or ask me if I wanted anything else before walking away."}
{"text":"This is the worst TSC Cafe location. We've been waiting in the drive through for nearly 20 minutes now, with only 2 cars in front of us. We've gone to this location several times, usually at night, so we thought maybe that was the reason. Unfortunately, this location is just slow, and the workers are always extremely apathetic."}
{"text":"Service was \"OK\" they seemed a little short staffed and the workers looked overwhelmed. 
I got a Lean Machine smoothie, and I would say 4 out of 5 stars.
My friend got the Sunrise Sunset smoothie, GROSS!!
I had one sip and it left an awful aftertaste in my mouth, the Thai chicken wrap he got was also NOT good.....that was the first time I went there..... And honestly will probably be the last.
Not for me."}
{"text":"This has to be THE POOREST SERVICED drive thru in Las Vegas. I've waited 10+ mins on several occasions with not as much as a \"I'll be right with you\" from the speaker. This is such a poorly run shop that I won't be surprised if it's closed in less than a year. They don't answer their phone either."}

{"text":"This place couohave so much potential and they really have good smoothies but every time I come here my smoothies are very watered down and flavorless. I just got a Bahama mama and I literally can't taste the white chocolate or the coconut, and there is a lot of extra water on the top of it, It's really disappointing! It stinks because I know what they are supposed to taste like but this place is constantly disappointing.

Honestly if this place had completely new management it would be a 5  but they always have problems, scanner doesn't work, their systems are down, can only take cash, smoothies are consistently inconsistent, my smoothie I just got is super watery and all I changed was less sugar"}
{"text":"Ya I used to work here and the management was horrible, as an employee I was often working by myself during a lunch rush with a line out the door and nobody to help me. We often ran out of products because management never ordered things in time. I pretty much held this place together for a year and I told them that when I left, that they would close within 3 to 4 months because the location was not good, that was in May and they have now since closed"}

{"text":"No matter day or night this place is always a hot mess, always understaffed and no type of leadership. It takes 20 minutes per person to order and another 20 minutes to get your food and then when you do get your food and realize it's done incorrectly it takes another 20 minutes to get it corrected this place is a place is a joke!!!!"}
{"text":"This is purely informational. The restaurant says they are closed from April 23rd to May 8th 2018 for remodel."}
{"text":"11:32 on 5/12/18 and if this location is supposed to be 24/7 that's a lie. A line of cars was in the drive thru with no one answering. You could hear someone in the back making noise but no service for their customers. Shut this place down already and fire all involved honestly if you don't care about your customers then you shouldn't be in business. To make your paying customers wait and have to ask if anyone is available to assist them is absurd and worse TO HAVE NO ONE ANSWER."}
{"text":"This place has great quality food and good smoothies. However, that does not make of for the lack of service. I work in the service industry myself so I can empathize with the poor girl working by herself. The past two times I have come in there was only one associate working. She was taking orders, making food, making smoothies, and also doing her daily side work while I line was out the door. TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT!!! Staff for success people. Took 30 minutes from the time we stood at the register waiting for our order to be taken until we got our food and smoothies. Never going back."}
{"text":"If you have the option, go to a Jamba Juice instead. They were out of large cups when we arrived (solution being they would give you two small cups), then my daughter (6) ordered a new flavor and when she tried it she didn't like it. When I took it back to the counter asking if we coukd exchange it for a different flavor, he gave me the pained look on his face, sucked air through his teeth, tilted his head and said \"Hmm, that's tough. Hmmm. Well, I'll do this one time.\" Umm, okay. Thanks for the \"favor\". Jamba Juice always says \"Oh, don't worry, if you don't like it we can just make you a different flavor\". We will not be back."}

{"text":"Disappointment doesn't begin to describe the food, the service or the cleanliness of this location.
We ordered the Spinach Salad, add grilled chicken. It is advertised with raspberry vingarette. We received a yogurt ice creamy dressing. We asked for the proper dressing, they didn't have it. The salad had syrupy canned peaches-what! That's a healthy salad?
More importantly, the employees, the new kid, who has been here for 2 weeks was nice, the others, why do they have jobs?? I went to the counter to tell them the table was dirty. He handed me a roll of dry paper towels and told me I could go in the bathroom to get them wet - really??
Why are snot working? Why was I charged for inferior food? Why is their no manager who hasn't fired the fools? I hear people want jobs, there should be  two openings here tonight!
I hated to give them one star, they are really bad. CORPORATE they are ruining your brand!!"}
{"text":"Worst tropical smoothie location! Turn around and walk away!! For some reason they only have ONE person on staff at all times so the poor employee has to take the and make the order ONE BY ONE ... most people get tired of waiting and just leave ..... there's a reason why this place is ALWAYS empty."}
{"text":"Smoothies are great- sunrise sunset being my favorite.. I come here weekly when i have work in the area... The customer service gets better and better every time i come in"}
{"text":"Maybe I just don't eat enough at tropical smoothie to know that this might be their normal but no matter what I order from there that has cheese, its NEVER melted. I'll get a hot food with cold, unmelted cheese. It's like they forget the item needed cheese and just throw a few handfuls in there. Even the quesadilla was just a warm tortilla with, again, cold and unmelted cheese. 

I think I'll just stick to ordering their smoothies. Seems to be the only thing they can get right most of the time."}
{"text":"I use to love this place but I'm done! Slow rude service. The place is filthy dirty. The last three time I came my order was messed up. Where do they find these people. The consistency on food and smoothies is inconsistent.  You never know what you're going to leave with?"}
{"text":"Okay this is just getting ridiculous. Is there corporate that comes by to make sure these locations are ran correctly? I legit sat in drive thru for a half an hour and waited 10 minutes just to place my order. Then when I got to the window to pay, the cashier gave me this outlandish price for the meal I ordered claiming it was correct. So for the next 20 minutes waiting, I went online to price check and low and behold this lady overcharged me.  I was credited the money back and charged the correct price. But after all that hassle, I opened up my food to see they gave me the wrong wrap. ? They threw some concoction together that doesn't even match up to any of the items on the menu."}
{"text":"Good service, line was a little long so the drive thru girl axtually came around and took our order, we went and sat and she quickly found us and gave us our drinks. Nice to see old fashion good service. Thanks"}
{"text":"I know it's hard to work at these types of cafes and everyone has a bad day. That being said I talked to three employees that just hated their life. Idk if there is a bad dynamic going on here, but the service part of it is suffering because of that. Second, the food was just okay, it wasn't anything I couldn't make at home with basic Safeway ingredients. The smoothie was basically Jamba Juice, and the prices weren't that bad. 

Positives: good smoothies, good prices, quick service getting food 

Negatives: cheap cheap ingredients, poor customer service attitudes"}
{"text":"The worst smoothie spot in Vegas, crazy because anthem is so beautiful. The service and smoothie making there is horrendous. It's always under staffed with a single young high school or college student who is to overwhelmed to focus on a good smoothie or good service. Very poorly run, tropical smoothie hasn't caught up with the times, and fell so far behind other smoothie spots"}
{"text":"There's a guy that works there now. His name is Andy and is really nice! I had the bad experience with the girl and didn't want to go back to this location, but Andy was the best. Thanks again Andy and I promise to tip you next time! :)"}
{"text":"Tropical. Not paradise. 

This chain smoothie location isn't amazing, but it does the trick. I came here after a four-hour long dentist appointment and needed some sustenance. I didn't feel like driving the extra two minutes down the road to Greens and Proteins, nor did I want to spend nine dollars on a smoothie. Not hating on G&P, just stating a fact. 

This was probably the first time I walked into Tropical Smoothie and there wasn't a line out the door. I stepped up to order and I waited and waited... finally a person walked up to help. \"I'll take the Peanut Paradise please\", my order was placed and I waited and waited, and waited. By this point there was now a line out the door and there are only two people working here. Yikes. 

Finally my order was called, but not before they called out two mystery smoothie orders. When I first walked-in this place was empty, who orders a smoothie and bails? 

Would I recommend this place, probably not? But if you're the Smoothie-Masochistic type, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Smoothie was fine.  Service was fine.  Just really really slow.  I'll continue going to the drive through one up the street."}
{"text":"I have gone to tropical smoothie for the last 4 years because it is near my work and the company I work for had set up a business agreement that offers us a percentage off our order. I have always had a great experience there but the last two times I have ordered from them I have had the worst customer service experience from the same cashier. Last time the cashier was really rude to me off the bat but I brushed it off assuming she had just had a bad day. I had asked for my company discount and she said she wasn't familiar with it so they must not offer it. When I asked her to check she said she had been there for a couple of months so she would know. It wasn't worth making a big deal about so I paid full price and left. Today I went in and the same cashier was at the front so I didn't even bother asking for the discount but the cashier was still really rude. I placed my order and went back to work only to find my order was made COMPLETELY wrong. When I called in the same cashier answered and I asked to speak with the manager this is how the conversation went. 

Me 'Hello I would like to speak to the manager, is she available?'

Her 'no she's not here'

Me 'ok... Do you know when she will be back?' 

Her ' ummm I don't know. Ummm Maybe Sunday (giggle)...'

Me ' maybe Sunday? Ok, can I have her name please'

Her 'Ummmmm...' 

Me 'your managers name, please?'

Her 'Kim?'

Me 'And what is your name?'

Her 'Clarissa?' 

I clearly wasn't going to get any help from this girl so I ended the conversation at that point"}
{"text":"Another trip smoothie w horrible customer service. Workers are so rude and will not make your smoothie the way you want it.. waste of time and money."}
{"text":"The workers were so friendly, my food came out quickly, tasted delicious and I was able to study for a few hours unbothered! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Been here about 5 times now and haven't received great customer service yet. I think I was greeted at the window maybe once. Normally it's just window open and the total demanded of me. No enthusiasm or smiles. 

One time I came through and a female cashier told me \"the item I wanted was still frozen, so it would take longer\" .. Cool.. Ironically I ended up getting it faster than other visits. 

The drive thru menu is at an awkward slant and I found it difficult to read the first time I came. 

They're still pretty new, so hopefully management gets the employees to at least pretend they somewhat give a damn. Unfortunately, this seems to be the common theme with multiple locations from reviews I've read. The best location for service has been off Cheyenne and the 215, in my experience.

Cmon guys! You sell a great product! Have a better attitude!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service! We went in there and waited about five minutes before anybody even acknowledged us! Then it took another few minutes before anybody came to take our order. We walked out, not worth it. We will definitely not be returning. It's too bad because we work across the street."}
{"text":"Stephanie needs to work on her personal presentation.   She stands there with a blank look to greet you.  Doesn't say a word.  I am a regular and really like this place."}
{"text":"This place doesn't even deserve a 1 star!!! It sucks! The staff including the manager where super unprofessional. While I was paying an employee interrupted my transaction and I have to wait. Also once we got our smoothies they were extremely watered down and tasted like nothing. I could have just drank water instead of a $6 bland drink!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this location is still in business, it has been horrible for years!  The drive thru sign is all busted up and there is graffiti all over the place plus the service is extremely slow.  Whenever I have tried to order one of the sandwiches they claim they are out of one of the ingredients... sure I understand once maybe but all the time?  I love Tropical Smoothie Cafe but after numerous attempts have decided to avoid this location permanently."}
{"text":"Everytime I come to the location, they put you on hold in the drive thru. It takes them 15 minutes to take your order. You pull up to the window it's another 10 minutes to pay and then on top of that another 20 minutes to get your food. Do not come to this location. Smoothies are thick they aren't even smoothie like. I've came here multiple times thinking maybe they will speed up but they don't. If I could give no stars I would."}
{"text":"As if having crippling anxiety isn't terrible enough, the guy taking my order and tropical smoothie questions my order when I ask for a cranberry truffle smoothie as if I just made it up, then he finds it in the computer and has nothing to say. Then I had a coupon for a flatbread and he says they're out of flat breads so I asked if he could make my food on something else. He ended up saying he would make it on a wrap and then gave me the wrong change totally shorting me after complaining he didn't have change for a $20 in his drawer and I still tipped him with no thank you or anything. Way to make me feel uncomfortable...oh and did I mention when me and one other customer walked in there was nobody up front and we were both waiting around for him to come out from the back for several minutes. Horrible experience...oh and now after almost a half hour of waiting he didn't make my food with beyond meat like I specified so now I'm waiting for it to be remade"}
{"text":"Every time I have came here there's no line yet I'm waiting forever, first time I waited do long, with no help I left, , this time I tried paying with a $100 in drive through,  as I was waiting for 10 minutes looking for a sign stating no bill over $20 or something there was not a sign,  but JUST SO EVRYONE KNOWS THE CAN'T TAKE $100 BILL"}
{"text":"The smoothies are great! Just know they add turbinado (sugar) automatically so just ask if you don't want it. They gal working did an excellent job. She was the only one working and there were 8 of us waiting for our drinks. Maybe don't schedule only one person on a busy afternoon. But I'm not the manager. Made for a long wait time. But not her fault!"}
{"text":"Tried this for the very first time and man i am hooked. Great customer service. Had my Bahama mama in mins. Would of given 5 star but dining area was really dirty. Other than that keep up the great work."}
{"text":"So were do i start with this ratchet ass spot. Firts noticed that juice that should be refrigerated was sitting on a shelf all bad. Second as we were giving our order the girl behind the counter her phone rings so she stops with are order to answer her phone who does that so rude. Wont be going thru there again good looking management"}
{"text":"Best Smoothies!!! Perfectly Blended and Sweetened just right!!! Very nice staff and fast service too!!! Thank you guys for keeping us cool in such hot weather!!!"}
{"text":"I've never had a problem with this location, the morning time workers definitely have to be my favorite just because they are always friendly especially for being early morning. They usually remember my order since I would go up to 3-4 days a week but I don't think they would just because I tend to change it once in awhile. I love getting the peanut paradise with no sugar and soy protein, definitely my favorite."}
{"text":"Wow. I am floored.

Went in on Mother's Day for a fast bite before an appointment we had at 11:00, got into the store about 10:30. There was ONE COUPLE in front of us who got smoothies and meals which the girl was already working on when we walked in. Our order did not even get taken until 10:45!!

There was only one girl taking orders and preparing them, a line forming behind us. Several times a guy poked his head out from the back and never once came out to give her a hand. 

I felt a little bad for the girl, but is this any way a business should be ran?!

Not only that but I was over charged and given the wrong wrap from what i ordered. I didn't bother with it because once we got my order I already had to wait at the front for her for 5 mins because she forgot the fruit cup, I wasn't waiting any longer. Also my smoothie (a smoothie I've had several times) tasted horrible and flavorless! 

So much for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"This is seriously the most ridiculous disgusting service ever. No manners or desire to hide the fact that she hates working here. Couldn't even completely my order without them rudely rushing and pushing me. Every time id say \"give me a second\" they'd blurt out a price or say \"soooo, what can I get you\" without 5 seconds passing by. She's super rude & the owner should seriously have a team meeting."}
{"text":"This place has the most unbelievable smoothies and flatbread sandwiches. Food and drink items are reasonably priced . Service is very quick.  The establishment is clean and I love the reggae music they play in the background. I ordered the sunrise sunset smoothie and the apple chicken flatbread. I also tried the Hawaiian BBQ flatbread. It's so good and made fresh to order. This is going to be my new  go to spot."}
{"text":"Worst place ever waited 40 mins for a Fucking smoothie then asked for the manager and guy at the window asked why ... Smoothie taste like swamp water"}
{"text":"I order two smoothies, we paid 10+ just to taste blended up ice and a hint of more blended up ice. The kid that made our drinks looks like he was 16 and didn't know how to make a proper drink. I am not one bit happy"}
{"text":"The smoothies are great but the wait time inside and through the drive thru is ridiculous. We've been 20 minutes waiting for only one smoothie. This is my only complaint. There should be more 2 persons working at this facility."}
{"text":"Convenient and quick. The marketing leads you to believe it's like a raw juice bar, but be careful because there is a lot of sugar in their drinks and cheese on their food. Totally not knocking the flavor or products, had a smoothie today - just order with more veggies, less fruits and added splenda. Basic menu also moves people along more quickly which is good when you're on the run for lunch. Has a good counter service vibe and really nice staff. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Awesome friendly service, accurate and prompt and not to mention delicious perfect place to spend a lunch break."}
{"text":"I used to come in here for smoothies from time to time when I was in school nearby. I think they even catered salads and wraps to an event for us once. I stopped in here with friends for a smoothie a couple weeks ago when I was visiting. 

The inside of the place is pretty colorful and has the same general plastic feel of most fast food chains. My friends live close and come here a lot. They say the main reason is it's cheap and they also get coupons in the mail. They said the service is terrible though. This day was no exception because when I asked about gluten-free they just gave me a shrug and had no interest in helping me figure out if the ingredients were OK. After a lot of probing, I decided the peanut butter smoothie seemed safe.

The smoothies only come in one size which makes it difficult for one person to finish and there is a lot of waste. Mine was pretty terrible, it really just tasted like watered down chemically peanut butter. So I didn't drink it. The boys liked their wraps and from what I can remember from when I had previously eaten here years ago, I used to think their salads were pretty good. But I only base my reviews off current experiences.

Overall, not sure if there is much reason to eat here, unless it's pretty much just proximity and cheap prices that make it a convenient place to grab something quick."}
{"text":"Fast and reliable. Quality shakes too. The guy working there was awesome! Definitely going the more often."}
{"text":"The location of this cafe is great,especially for military.The staff that works there were nice BUT one girl had hickies all over her neck that were not covered and she was the one taking my order. I Ordered a chicken,bacon,ranch sandwich (which took about 20 min to get) when I recieved the order I only had chicken and lettuce.My Friend who had ordered the same thing order was messed up too. This is probobly the most unprofessional location.Previously I went to this location and walked into a full blown argument between the employees,and another time I went it was dirty and the lights were out even though they were still open. I won't be returning to this location."}
{"text":"Good food, but don't order ahead, lacking in having orders ready when they are supposed to."}
{"text":"Customer service is strange. Friendly yet disorganized. Disorganized in the sense of workmanship priority. The establishment was a tad messy. Not particularly \"dirty\" but disorganized. Tables partially wiped down. The kitchen was organized but the floor was not the business. Like, \"grab the mop and broom, please. Thanks.\" Not to mention that my wrap was left halfway finished because the register was low on change and it was pivotal that it be restocked there and then. 
Not to mention that the establishment wasn't busy, so there was nothing to skew them from tiding up a bit. 
Overall, Tropical Smoothie never disappoints when it comes to food and beverages but this one should consider retraining or better management."}
{"text":"It's a smoothie place, I'm not sure what else can be said. They take fruit, ice, and other ingredients, blend them up and make smoothies.

They have a pretty solid menu of smoothies, and a bunch of boosters, I've never been a huge fan of smoothies, but if the mood strikes Tropical Smoothie works out well"}
{"text":"The smoothies here are always great, no complaints with the food. Unfortunately the employees that were working on the day I came in were absolutely terrible. My mother and I walked in in plain view, the employees stared at us and continued their personal life conversation for five minutes. If the red headed girl and the girl with long black hair are working, don't waist your time with trying to order."}
{"text":"I'm sad to be writing this review. When I worked days I would stop at this location at least 3 times a week. The place was always clean and the employees were always super friendly. I quit working days a few months ago and was in the mood for my fav smoothie, aci berry boost. I've had this SO many times and was excited for another. The smoothie that I got this visit was a watery mess. It was SO thin in consistency and lacked the usual taste of my smoothie. I was in a rush and didn't realize how bad this smoothie was until I was a few miles away from them. It seemed there is new workers and possibly new management. I am hoping to find a new smoothie place as I will not be back."}
{"text":"I love their hummus wrap here and the smoothies of course. I subtracted one star because it's a little pricy and it smells kinda funky."}
{"text":"I stopped by here today noticing the Artisan Tacos, ordered a Mojo Fish and this steak. Twice now, they've been out of both and out of fruits cups. I ordered a tortilla.  They are served on 6 inch flour tortillas with fresh ingredients.  The fish taco normally would have a hint of cilantro and lime which was good. The chicken would come with cheddar cheese. For 5 bucks you can get a superfood smoothie. I'm skeptical of the place because of poor reviews on here and because there are many. My experiences here have ranged from good to bad. I'll give it a decent review for now."}
{"text":"In order: 
Small.
Overpriced. 
Bland. 
Icky. 
Not a fan of this place at all. Food was the same I would expect from a Wal-Mart deli.  Place has a very bad vibe to it. Hard to put my finger on, but I was the only person there, the service was one poor guy who had to come from the back and take his time making a wrap which was 95% lettuce and a tiny bit of chicken with very little seasoning. Next time it would be better to just take my $10 and buy a few heads of lettuce."}
{"text":"came to this place on a Monday approximately 7pm, there were two employees working , if there was an animal slower than a sloth they'd fit the description, one of the employees was kind enough to look an make eye contact but that was it, my wife and I stood there and waited, and waited, and waited ...waited some more then left. if Tiabi would've been open I would've gone there instead."}
{"text":"The food is actually very good. The service is not, which is no fault of the employees. This location badly needs additional staffing during peak times. It's too bad because the restaurant has a lot of potential."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! I'm pretty picky with my green smoothies, but decided to go with the Island Green (spinach, kale, pineapple, mango, and banana). One of the best ones I've had especially for a reasonable price of around $7 including tax AND for a 20 oz. I promise you you can't taste the greens at all since the fruit takes over the flavor. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"One person working most of the time.  Sometimes there is no line,  sometimes you are 15 minutes away from even having your order taken. Very hit and miss. If you think of it last minute you can try coming here,  but have a back up plan if there is more than one person in line in front of you.  Today there are actually 2 people working for the first time I have seen it.  I have been here 10 minutes and still a few away from getting my order.  They should try harder"}
{"text":"The smoothies are GREAT, and the food is good, would be better if the wraps weren't 70% tortilla! Its really too bad I really like some of the wraps, but its like 7$ with maybe 1/2 cup of ingredients in a HUGE tortilla. Most of the time dont have anyone on that has a clue, so i ALWAYS double check that they gave me what i ordered."}
{"text":"We had an issue here and reached out to management. The district manager spoke with me directly and made sure she did everything she could to make up for what happened. 

Thank you for caring about your customers!"}
{"text":"My first time trying this place was about 2-3 weeks ago (end of Sep. 2015). I was really craving a good smoothie and found them on Google. It was late in the evening (past 8pm) and the Jamba Juice by my house was already closed. So decided to give this place a shot. I walked in and there was only one employee. I told her I was a first-timer and asked what were the popular items. She seemed really pleasant and was super helpful. I also asked what else was included in the smoothie and how they are sweetened. She was very knowledgable about their smoothies; I always appreciate when employees know exactly what they offer at their restaurant/cafe. So I ended up trying the \"Island Greens\". It was amazing and I was instantly hooked! I've been back 3-4 times since then. 

My most recent trip was earlier today for lunch. I typically just get a smoothie but since I hadn't eaten lunch yet, I decided to try their food. This time there were two guys working. I asked they guy at the register about their flatbreads and he was able to describe them with detail and even suggested his favorites. So I ordered the Tzatziki Steak Flatbread. It was pretty good - it was basically a circle pita bread, toasted, and folded in half, stuffed with steak, Tzatziki sauce, tomatoes, lettuce, and onions. I think there was some cheese in there too, but I ate it so fast I didn't even notice. I would recommend it. 

Smoothies: 5-Stars! The Island Greens was the first thing I tried and haven't looked back. It's what I get every time.

Food: I have only tried the Tzatziki Steak Flatbread, and it was pretty good. Not too sure how fresh the steak was but I presume it is a better choice than your McDonald's and Burger King's of the world.

Customer Service: From the previous reviews, it would seem like this place has some issues with management, training their employees, and customer service, but I haven't had a problem with them. I suppose their staff could be a little more \"jolly\" but it's not like they were rude by any means.

Overall: Super happy with their smoothie. Customer service met my standards. Because this place is a SMOOTHIE spot, I give them 5-Stars."}
{"text":"Workers like Christine totally restore my faith in this company! Kind, considerate, informative, pleasant, and welcoming. Nothing like my experience at Blue Diamond's Tropical Smoothie not too long ago (read previous review) with the rude girl working grave yard hours. Kudos to you Christine and keep up the great work! Looks like I have found my new Tropical Smoothie go-to!"}
{"text":"I love this place to death and it's the closest location to me. However, recently I've been having awful experiences. For example just yesterday my mom and I waited in the drive through for more than 20 minutes after work to get our order. We were the second car in line and the people in front of us waited just as long. They did not order tons of smoothies, mind you. Maybe 2 or 3. And I ordered just one. And when we finally arrived at the window they had my total incorrect. Luckily I was paying attention for that. I ordered the avocalada and it was amazing. 
Another example of a bad experience was one day when I ordered the Bahama Mama. I've had it once before and it was really good, but this last time I noticed something wasn't right. I'm still not quite sure what it was that totally messed with the taste or the texture but I couldn't take it. I tried to disregard it and just drink it because I paid for it, you know? But I couldn't do it. I didn't even get to half. 
Anyways, if you kept reading for this review, thank you for bearing with me. Like I said, I love this place. But it has it's down times as well. I might have to take a break of coming here for awhile until I get another craving for an Avocalada."}

Speedy and concise service. What did I get, spent 10 minutes waiting in line. I know for a fact no one orders that many items in front of me all the time. Next. A happy greeting is the difference from oh this place is friendly, then alright excuse me for bothering you. Please just greet me in a happy mood. It does make a difference from a service stand point. And I come here for flavor. Not watered down smoothies. Why is this the only location this happens to me. I won't be coming back here anymore. I'm really disappointed because I really like tropical smoothie cafe. But this location has been up to par. Really disappointed. Jamba Juice. You can have my money now."}
{"text":"EXTREMELY slow services and immature workers that are clearly still in high school. By time I got my smoothie after the 15 minutes in the drive through it was melted. There are people behind the counter that are NOT in uniform. Also smells funny"}
{"text":"Terrible place. Will never go back. I waited almost 20 minutes and never had my order taken. It took the guy 10 minutes to say that he will be right with me, then disappears into the back. I finally got fed up and left."}
{"text":"Everytime I come in this place there is either one or two people working which makes everything slow I'm still waiting on my food after being here for more than 25 minutes on an hour lunch. And the cashier Kristen took my order received my money but unfortunately was not able to give back change correctly and had to ask for help on which her help had to use a calculator on her phone in order to know the difference of $11.33 from $15, in addition to having to get a refund on my bowl because I never got it my refund was issued in a gift card for my bowl and with 2 minutes to spare I have to go back to work hungry and unsatisfied very poor costumer service indeed"}
{"text":"I ordered around 10 minutes after 4am for a smoothie in the drive through. The person in front of me had ordered food and smoothies so I assumed I'd have to wait maybe no more than 5 minutes than usual. I assumed wrong. 25 minutes later, (15 of those minutes was waiting at the window for the person working to provide me the smoothie I ordered. I actually left the drive through and got gas for my car. When I returned, it still took an additional 5 minutes to get my smoothie) Now, I am not upset at the employee. I want to make that very clear. He was doing his job. Its not his fault he was working ALONE, taking all orders, cashing people out AND making all the food and drinks. 
With that being said, I have issues with this.
1. I don't care how \"safe\" the location may be. It isn't safe for a person to be working in a food and beverage setting by themselves on a graveyard shift in Las Vegas. Period. 24 hour places have been robbed with far more people working, having one person working makes it even easier for a desperate criminal to rob and injure that one employee. 
2. I can understand a business trying to save money by understaffing a shift, but when you're putting one person responsible for so many facets, you're making your company look like a bunch of cheap bastards who don't care about the well being of their employees or the service they provide. 
3. A multi-million dollar company doesn't need to save money by over working a person in a very unsafe situation by leaving him to run the place alone. What kind of image do you think this leaves for the customers who've made this company those multi-millions? 
4. I go to tropical smoothie for the 24 hour convenience since I also work well into the early mornings. However, it's only because they're aren't 24 hour Jamba Juice locations. Because of this, I'm more than willing to wait until Jamba Juice opens in the morning than continue bringing my business to tropical smoothie. I know the loss of my business isn't some big deal. But I do have a loud mouth and I will be making sure everyone I know is made aware of this."}
{"text":"I have been going to Tropical Smoothie's forever, and I always get the same shake. mocha madness, it's my favorite. I was super disappointed in my experience with this store. Not only did it take them nearly 20 min to make my shake, but also it is filled coffee grounds which covered my teeth and now I can't drink it. Worst drink and place. Don't go."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars, I would. I have been here many times, and the first thing is that the workers there never seem enthusiastic or very helpful. The next thing is that the last two times I came to order food from the drive thru, the first instance nobody even answered when I pulled up. I waited around 16 minutes. Then the second time, it took about ten minutes for someone to answer. I gave them my order and pulled up to the window at which I wasn't greeted at, at ALL. I waited almost 30 minutes and nobody came to the window. As I was waiting, I was watching the worker help out this customer that walked into the restaurant AFTER I came there, giving the lady her food and everything. After she had left, the worker had not acknowledged me. I left in frustration and decided I will never go there again. Used to be one of my favorite places to go but the service was awful."}
{"text":"I waited for 20 mins to be served before I walked out. Tropical smoothie is always SO SLOW, but this was ridiculous."}
{"text":"Understaffed .... very slow service, poor attitudes, will look for other places next time"}
{"text":"After reading all the Yelp reviews, I was really hesitant to go to this place....but wanting a smoothie at 2 am won over my hesitation. Since then, I've been to this place (the drive thru) three times and all three times have been quick, easy, and the smoothies have been as great as I remember Tropical Smoothie to be. The workers I've gone across have all been nice and provided good service. I'm not sure if I've just been lucky the past three times...but I have no complaints!"}
{"text":"Terrible franchise! Promotes vegan friendly but never have it in stock. This is the 3rd time I have stopped by here. Change your staff or this location will close down soon. 0 star."}
{"text":"Store hours state that it's open till 2am, came at 10pm and there's a note on the door saying we will be back in 15min. Other people waiting said they've been here for 30 minutes.



Additional: just in case my sandwich was short on protein they  made sure to include ants!"}
{"text":"Wow they've gotten worse. It's been a couple of months for me and I come in to three people waiting and one person working, that's normal, but then I finally get to order and they don't have coconut and they're only taking cash. Awesome!! I had cash and still walked out. Reiterated the fact that this location is THE WORST. Even after my complaint here on Yelp and three written complaints, it's clear they just don't care."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here three times, and will never go back. First time they got our order wrong. I ordered  two sandwiches and two smoothies, I got two smoothies and one sandwich. Second time they got the two smoothies and two sandwiches, but then forgot the chips. While I was standing at the counter to tell her about my chips (about 3 to 4 minutes), the front cashier girl was just standing in the sandwich making area texting on her phone. The third time we went in everything was correct with our meal. But our receipt said $23.21 and my bank account said they took $27.85. They overcharged me on my card, then refused to give me my money back for the amount they overtook(only $4.64, but it was still money that they over took). They told me it's my bank's problem and I need to call my bank. While I'm calling my bank, I could hear them trash-talking me in the back. After disputing with the person at the register for 7 minutes and people in line behind me they finally gave me my money back."}
{"text":"Seems every tropical smoothie I walk into in Las Vegas is a mess. This location has filthy windows and door, wrappers all over the floor that did not collect in the last 10 minutes. 

I used to come in the stores as an alternative to a fly-by-night smoothie places that pop up and having more locations but understaffing and slow service in addition to the above condition issues will probably keep me no longer patronizing this brand."}
{"text":"Love this place, smoothies are outstanding, flatbreads are on point, wraps are fantastic. Never had a bad meal, not ever! And the prices beat all of their competitors. Love that they're open 24/7......with only one small drawback. They used to be available on Über Eats all the time but now there seems to be a cut off time. Bad news for me as I work late and used to love to order after I got off work. Oh well, everything they offer is excellent, here's to hoping they offer late night delivery / Über Eats participation again."}
{"text":"Yummy. I had the immune boost for an  illness the other day with probiotics added. Delish. My new favorite place!!"}
{"text":"I ordered from the app because I was on a tight schedule. They started it when I walked in to pick it up. Wow!"}
{"text":"So refreshingly delicious

We really enjoy Tropical Smoothie Café and are so glad there is a location close to home. My nephew, 11, asks to go there often and the smoothies are a great way to boost his fruit and veggie intake. 

I usually get the \"Island Green\" smoothie, it's so refreshingly delicious. My nephew enjoys all of the fruit smoothies, especially the \"Rockin Raspberry\".  To be honest we usually don't eat at Tropical Smoothie Cafe very often but I highly recommend the loaded spinach salad or the Buffalo Chicken Wrap, both entrée's are tasty and fresh.

 Service is excellent and as fast as can be when you are making smoothies to order. If you enjoy smoothies give Tropical Smoothie Cafe a try."}
{"text":"Called in my lunch order at 11:30 and arrive at noon. The lady never put in my order... no big deal I understand things get busy around lunch and shit happens. But then the worker, Autumn, blatantly lies and won't admit to taking my order. She was the only one working at the time. I had the call on my call log. She did nothing to fix it."}
{"text":"Lonnnnnnnnnnnng wait. The kid was trying hard but was overwhelmed. I blame ownership for this. Hire more people. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Store needs more help and a thorough overhaul. Dirty, really sad considering they upped their prices on everything. Tropical Smoothie...clean this store. Get more help. Maybe I'll be back. Driving to GV Parkway...newer, cleaner and a drive thru. Staff is nice though considering."}
{"text":"One of the worst locations with extremely bad service. Ordered from the app a half hour ahead. Showed up to be told that the system is not taking orders and that she would make it at that moment. Nope, had to wait after two other orders. This is only one in a series of terrible visits. Please get your act together."}
{"text":"I really like this place! I like the smoothies better than Jamba Juice actually. The Acaí Berry Boost is my fave. Their chicken pesto flatbread is delicious. I'm looking forward to trying their tacos in the future, which I hear are great. The service is slow, but the staff is always very nice to me. I'd rather have it take a few minutes longer to make a quality drink than to rush through it and just toss whatever in."}
{"text":"This is honestly the worst tropical smoothie I've ever been to this is what they gave me! I mean really there was absolutely no one in the restaurant and only one car in the drive thru. I ordered a sun rise sunset Worst customer service the girl and guy working on 06/08/17 at 7:30pm should really focus on doing there job rather than listening to inappropriate music."}
{"text":"The new management is awful! 
The smoothies are literally just blended ice 
The food is horrible I got a chicken pesto it came out cold and all I got was chicken cheese and Lettuce...."}
{"text":"The food is good and fresh, but I left hungry and it its WAY over priced. Won't be going back..."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever!! 15 min just to take our order and 10min for a smoothie. 25min total just to jet a mango magic smoothie. If my son didn't want it we would have left. Amazed that this place is open!! Unacceptable"}
{"text":"Been waiting in drive thru line for 17 minutes. I'm not kidding. Can't leave since I'm stuck. Really 17 minutes. I really wanted to update my review for the better, but sadly it's not. Let's just hope that my order is not wrong like last time. It's a pretty simple place when u think of making something. I mean how hard is it to make a sandwich? So let's hope it's not messed up bcuz I won't wait any longer. 17 minutes in a drive thru is absurd."}
{"text":"Horrible location, they are always out of something.  Since the location is close to my house I have stopped by here often and each time has been nothing but disappointment.  Last month we went and they were out of cups and lids, they had to put our smoothies in several children's cups with no lids on them.  We tried to order food but they were out of every ingredient BUT lettuce.  We went back a few days later and they were out of straws, we had to eat our smoothie with a spoon.  A few weeks ago we went around 9pm and they had signs posted that they were out of food because their freezers broke down, Interestingly enough, the same sign was up a week later around 9pm;  either third shift doesn't like cooking food or the management could care less about fixing their equipment.  Today I went in (my last time going back here) and they were out of money  and only accepting CC.  Horrible customer service and poor management, someone isn't doing their job very well."}
{"text":"Worst tropical smoothie experience ever. Their smoothies are always good, but today's service would shut a place down. 

The girls that work here are unfriendly, even borderline disrespectful. There were 9 people ahead of my order, so I expected to wait. The girls never once greeted anyone, or even said have a nice day. One customer asked for her receipt and the girl who was ringing up said \"CAN YOU GIVE ME A MINUTE??\" In a rude tone. I was irritated by it across the room. My smoothie came up and the cup had spilled smoothie all over it. 

I'll stick with my typical tropical smoothie and steer clear of here."}
{"text":"4 star smoothies and 2 star service. 

Last visit they had no bananas at 1pm... 

GUYS! Try to find a smoothie without bananas in it. Pretty difficult. I ask the girl, \"so since you can't make smoothies with bananas in it right now, which smoothies can I get right now?\" She seems annoyed and was like \"Any smoothies without bananas or any smoothies with bananas we could sub the bananas for something else\". OBVIOUSLY.  Thanks for the help, girl. I just picked some random smoothie with no help from her. 

This visit they were dead. Not a single person in the shop. I'm a social person so decided to small talk while they made my smoothie (slow day, weather, etc.) Bad idea apparently. The one girl who rang me up was rude, and seemed annoyed by me talking to her. The girl making the smoothie couldn't hear anything over the blender, but was super sweet when giving me my smoothie. Seems crazy to have no customers in your store, and then the moment one enters it becomes an annoyance to the person creating the initial impression."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I ordered the Island Detox Smoothie. It had 0 flavor. Was it 80% ice % I HATE wasting my money."}
{"text":"Very good food and quick service :) the chicken pesto flatbread was great and so is the blimey limey smoothie"}
{"text":"One person working to take orders and make food. So we waited 20 minutes for 2 smoothies that were wrong and missing ingredients. Dont waste your money and time here! Also dont bother submitting a complaint  on their website because they will tell you to go to the restaurant to complain... umm why would I go back to the crappy place Im complaining about."}
{"text":"Not how it used to be, the employees don't take the time to make your drinks. Mine just taste like shaved ice"}
{"text":"Food is terrible. Smoothies are decent. Service is bad. Nobody looks happy to be there. Orders are generally screwed up and it takes awhile to fix them."}
{"text":"I always order the chocolate chiller and the Buffalo chicken wrap or the delicious chicken ceasar salad. Didn't realize this location is 24 hours and so close to home!"}
{"text":"Came to this location because I have enjoyed the Detox Island Green smoothie at a location in Texas. LOVE this smoothie! Ordered through the app but the order was cancelled by a very new employee with more attitude than sense. Waited the 15 minutes as indicated in the app for two smoothies to be made but when we arrived at the cafe we learned the order was cancelled because they were out of ginger and had to wait another 15 minutes for them to make it. You had my phone number, why didn't you call???"}
{"text":"The food and smoothies are actually good, but it takes forever to get them. They are severely understaffed. I go at lunch sometimes and always ask myself why I keep going back after. Please hire more help and we will come more! Even when it's slow they wait time is ridiculous. Tried to order ahead on the app they advertise and it is always down."}
{"text":"I order a peanut paradise then I got in the car when I try my smoothie it was just ice and water no flavor!!!! I was already driving in freeway didn't want to go back and complain ect. So there I pay 6$ for ice water lol. Avoid this place"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for a very long time and I really love the fact that they have the beyond meat!! so this is very nice it makes things very convenient the smoothies are always pretty good and the staff is pretty okay too. the sandwiches are always nice toasty and warm. Yum."}
{"text":"Not a fan. The wait is excruciatingly long if you're hungry or in a hurry. Ordered a flatbread smoked chicken and paradise smoothie, and I think they had to go out back to skin the chicken and hand picked the fruits one dang one at a time."}
{"text":"Hopefully the owner of this Tropical Smoothie takes a look at these reviews and has a nice little team meeting or pow wow to get this store together. They have to do better and have to do it FAST! I normally go to the location on Flamingo and Decatur where I never have any issues. This past week I just happen to be in the area and decided to try out this location since it's fairly new. I didn't have much time and actually was excited about them having a drive thru until hat experience turned into longer than I'd like. When I pulled up there was only one car ahead of me and the girl taking orders told me to hold. After about 5 minutes I'm like \"HELLO\" and she goes \"Go ahead with your order\" Really? I can't believe the lack of customer service and just flat out rude? Maybe try something like\" Thank you for your patience how may I take our order\"? I don't even work fast food nor drive thru's and have the proper scripting down so why can't they? I pulled around after my order for it to take another 5 minutes? Total of 10 minutes just for a smoothie is crazy. I'll stick to me normal.. First and Last visit that's for sure."}
{"text":"Got the special combo that included a small smoothie and half a sandwich for 6.99. 

And it was a lot more than I bargained for. 

First off, the \"small\" smoothie was anything but. I got the Kiwi Quencher and could barely finish is. Delish though. 

The half sandwich was really a hefty piece of bread with a generous amount of turkey, tomato and guacamole. I'd recommend the turkey, guacamole to anyone. 

Good stuff!"}
{"text":"We just went to Tropical Smoothie because my wife said they had the avocado smoothie. I was craving ice cream but we figured going there would of been a better option. Everything was fine and dandy till we got to the drive through. Sweet mercy that took literally 15 minutes (we timed it) to get out smoothie. I appreciate the fact they use natural ingredients and what not but that is a little too much. 

The smoothie itself was pretty dang good and they come in a good sized 24 oz cup. The price isn't too bad considering the above statement and its 24 hrs (don't see smoothie places doing that often). If it wasn't so good I would of left a 3 star because the wait is redonkulous."}
{"text":"this place has consistently provided slow, poor service. it sucks because their smoothies and wraps are SO GOOD though... I usually use the drive through to pretend the mess inside isn't actually there. the drive through always takes forever- I guess they're just way understaffed most of the time. thankfully I've never had a bad experience with the actual food but the service and the environment make me wary of coming back."}
{"text":"My only complaint with this place is the long waiting times. Regardless if you order inside or via drive thru, expect to wait a while for your food. That is to expect since the smoothies are made with fresh ingredients. However, it is worth the wait. The staff is always super friendly. Customer service has never been less than exceptional here. The flatbreads as well as the smoothies are amazing. I always get the chicken pesto flatbread with an avocalada smoothie. At first I was skeptical to try the avacolada because I didn't think avocado would taste good in a smoothie but it is AMAZING. This place is much better than the Craig location and WAY BETTER than the Aliante location."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised to learn that there was a Tropical Smoothie in the Whitney Ranch area. I always drove by it, but now I wished that I had never stopped in.

Was not greeted when I entered, stood at the register for about 5 minutes before anyone even acknowledged my presence, and then I was told \"we will be right with you\". Nearly another 10 elapsed before my order was taken with a very curt \"sorry\". 

Drinks were bland and just as we were about to leave, one of the workers nearly crashed into my wife as she bounded around the corner to the bathroom (lord only knows why). Wish I had read the reviews before we stopped in. Never going back there again."}
{"text":"The service is never great at this location, but today will mark my last visit to this location. There was a customer in line in front of us. The cashier just walked to the back without saying anything to us after taking their order. My wife and I stood there watching another associate peel bananas for a couple of minutes. That associate finally came up to the register to take our order. Our smoothies came out in a reasonable amount of time, but my wife's smoothie had sugar even though she ordered it without. I ordered the Caribbean Jerk bowl, it looks delicious in the picture on the menu. The bowl took 20 minutes to prepare and was missing the rice and beans that the menu indicates it should have. The couple pieces of chicken were ok and the jerk sauce was good. The dish was 90% shredded lettuce. I have included a picture."}
{"text":"I love tropical smoothie. I always order the same thing (Sunrise Sunset) but I feel like every time I come to this location, they always make it incorrectly. It never tastes the same. 
Usually it's more on the sweeter side. I feel like it's a waste of money when you're not receiving the same thing. I think this location has poor management. And it's always takes forever drive thru or walk-in."}
{"text":"I wanted a salad, but didn't like their menu options, so I asked for the tacos, on top of a bed of spinach and they did it! Decent prices. They only have one product with coffee, and it sounded really fattening, so I didn't get it. The customer service could be a little better, but the food is too good to really care too much!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, obvious that the employees do not want to be here. And customers sitting in the drive-thru line for almost half an hour. Is there not a \"no star\" option?"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this location is still open. Every time and I mean every time there is some excuse to where my order cannot be taken. They are very rude, unprofessional and really don't care about letting you know. One time I seen a lady come in with her friends and a bunch of kids and started making smoothies.... wtf is that how they get down? For a potential million dollar business, the owners are lucky to see 2 nickels. Please don't let your choice of employees kill your Small Business Franchise."}
{"text":"Food and smoothies are good, but the customer service there was horrible today. Tried the drive through, no one there to get our order so we went inside....no workers to be found either. Eventually a guy came slowly walking over from being on his phone at the neighboring restaurant to take our order...not enjoying the moment at all."}
{"text":"I'm only giving this place 5 stars because the poor employee here is kicking ass by herself and balancing orders so well she deserves a raise for being so awesome and tolerable."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Tropical Smoothie Cafe and wow, it's so good! The Sunrise Sunset smoothie was amazing! It was kind of tart with a little bit of sweet. Also I got the chipotle chicken flatbread and it was so fresh and tasty! My husband got the Hawaiian BBQ flatbread and that was good too. Great place! I will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Starting off...I've never been a huge fan of tropical smoothie. A lot of their smoothies just taste like there is nothing but powder added. Usually though I cave if I'm craving a smoothie because most of the places have very fun and friendly employees. This location I've been to a few times and I always tell myself I won't be back. They're very inefficient and love to take their sweet time. I stood in line once for 6+ minutes. Just to order my drink and even longer to receive it. Just a bunch of high-school kids that have no urgency. I also feel they're over priced for such little portions. I prefer to go to Jamba. They're very efficient and do what they can to make your experience top notch."}
{"text":"Located inside the Green Valley Ranch. It's in the food court area just upstairs over the movie theatre.

This is a small attached location with yogurt shop. The community seating for food court can be good or bad depending on how busy it is. When I was there it kinda sucked cuz there were a bunch of kids at the food court I think flowing over fro the movies.

The staff is friendly. Got my smoothie out reasonably fast and was in the mood for fresh orangy mango taste. Bammm Sunrise Sunset it was. Strawberries, Pineapple, Mango and Orange with extra orange. 
Had it my way and like it!!

Good spot for quick fresh while in thete and not wanting the whole restaurant thing.

All good - do it!"}
{"text":"Decided to go here because I did not feel like braving that $1 JJ's line wrapped around the building. The gal working was very efficient working the register, making the smoothies and sandwiches. She seemed to enjoy her job on this fairly busy Tuesday night which is always nice to see.

The smoothie of choice was the Avocadolada (spl?). I noticed it was not as grainy as the smoothies are at one of my other favorite smoothie spots. Plus they have a rewards program so I think I might see my way over here more often $;)

They have a Hawaiian chicken flatbread I also tried which was ok. It was not amazing but tasty enough. My smoothie was the big star so I will stick with ordering those in the future.

Also, the smoothie price here is about $1-2 lesser than other places so that's a plus.

All in all it's worth many repeat visits!"}
{"text":"Just found out they have breakfast sandwiches! worth a little wait for something freshly made rather than unfrozen at Starbucks. Better ingredients, bigger portions, so much fuller! Fresh ciabatta bread eggs made in house and melted cheese over sausage. I will be back! And I'm crazy about the health nut smoothie! Yum yum yum so underrated"}
{"text":"got a sunrise sunset and it's sour, there's no flavor to it. I dislike this location but it's the closest one to me and I have been craving a sunrise sunset smoothie but never again I'll just make the drive to a better location."}
{"text":"awesome spot for a fresh smoothie. my boyfriend, best friends, and i come here frequently to grab our smoothies after work and it is always a consistent, quality experience. my favorite is the blueberry bliss smoothie! perfect blend of sweet & savory. their wraps are pretty good too like the southwest and all american breakfast. I have tried a handful of things on the menu including the peaches and silk, the acai berry, the strawberry limeade, and many others. 

Kat, V, and Carissa are always at the window. Super friendly checkout and quality service despite the wait sometimes when they are busy or understaffed. This is my favorite tropical smoothie location for sure in town!"}
{"text":"Hummus veggie wrap smashed avocado, pepper jack cheese, Romain kale and spinach blend rice black beans in red pickled onions tomatoes and light ranch."}
{"text":"Check out Dee at this location! Best customer service! Don't forget to show your LVAC card for 10%off"}
{"text":"Stopped in for Saturday lunch. There were 4 people in front of me and only one person working. It took 30 minutes to receive my food. The employee kept the water running in the wash sink even when he walked away. I asked him if he forgot to turn the water off. He said, oh yeah. Turned it off. But then left it running again after washing more dishes. 

Service was slow, food was meh, and employees not conscious of water conservation. I will be going elsewhere from now on."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for a smoothie...it was good, the place was clean the staff was friendly  and they were open late. Sweet. 4 stars...only reason they didn't get 5, I thought they might be closed. Poorly lit up at night compared to most of the other shops in that area."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a tropical smoothie in a long time, and I used to think their food was decent, even if a bit overpriced. First it started off badly when I was the only one at the counter and there were three young women behind the counter and I politely waited for 5 minutes until I asked if someone would take my order, then a middle age male comes from behind the back to take my order and what I assume is his 5 year old son comes up and stands next to him, I'm ok with bring your kid to work day if that's what it was; but someone who saw me waiting could of gotten him, if they are not allowed to take orders. I ordered the chicken Cesar wrap and I have to admit that it was pretty gross. The chicken was mushy, almost like the chicken was made for a chicken salad or for someone without teeth. I though the wrap would have strips of chicken breast in it, but it did not. With other food court option in the area, I will not be coming back here"}
{"text":"That girl with the glasses is the worst! Doesn't even take orders after 1 pretends they're closed but really she's somewhere hiding in there lol what a joke"}
{"text":"pretty disappointed..the wraps and tacos are not that bad..but the smoothies didn't taste like real or fresh fruit. And it's pretty expensive.."}
{"text":"Tan and Brandon were great tonight! They let me in at 8:59 and were so friendly. Thank you for being accommodating for my last minute plans. I love your text message update and come here every week or sometime twice. Thanks for your great service."}
{"text":"Currently sitting here enjoying my smoothie, very well made. Behind me sits a father and his two children enjoying their smoothies, from the kitchen you hear \"what the f%#&\"  and loud obnoxious behavior. NOT A FAMILY PLACE AT ALL"}
{"text":"A smoothie from \"Tropical Smoothie\" is never a bad choice, yummy wraps if your tummy needs more!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on 4/18/17 around 12:30 pm. The little girl working there needs an attitude adjustment & some humility. I would've been glad to give it to her but that's her mom & dad's job plus i was in a good mood & it wouldn't have gone well. Bottom line is some people work too fucking hard for their money to have a 12 yr old be a little shit when they're just ordering a drink. You haven't experienced a hard life..yet."}
{"text":"Super slow, and bad service will not return to THIS location. Staff needs more training."}
{"text":"The front door, tables, and floor are all dirty which makes me question the cleanliness of the food. We ate in the restaurant and noticed most people took their food/smoothies to go which now makes sense. I had a Baja Chicken Wrap and it came with a white flour tortilla, white rice and iceberg lettuce. I was expecting better ingredients and taste. We also had a peach smoothie which was good. I can't imagine we'll be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying Tropical Smoothie Cafe as a company is great. They have delicious smoothies and healthy options. This review is for this specific location. 

I can't stress enough how bad their customer service is. They make it seem like helping you is a chore. No smile, no greeting, had me waiting for 5 minutes at the register without even acknowledging me. Took a very long time to prepare my smoothie, and handed it to me with an attitude. Management needs to get this fixed asap, but by their rating they don't seem to care either."}
{"text":"Long wait times both drive thru and inside. Also forgetful of what your order was. I've been to 3 different locations and this is the only one I have ever had an issue with."}
{"text":"i usually dont bad mouth a business but terrible place i just left after waiting 15minutes without anyone attending one of the customer said its normal in this place you order and go away and come back after 30minutes that is if they take your order in 30 minute. their smoothies are way over priced to have customers deal with it the owner is making money but refuse to hire 2 more people..shame on you..oh AND did i mention i am disabled for a month now due to an accident and i was waiting on crutches."}
{"text":"Just spent 27 minutes waiting in the drive through for a smoothie. There were multiple cars behind me and I'm not sure what's happening on the inside but the workers look flustered. When I did get the smoothie it tasted fine but not good enough to sit in a drive thru line for something that shouldn't take that long. Thankfully I didn't have anywhere to be like the person behind me who got out of her car to go inside to see what the hold up was."}
{"text":"10612 S. Eastern Avenue, LV, NV approx 1050am.
Bathroom not maintained.  No acknowledgement of us even entering the place or 'i'll help you out as soon as I can'. Employee looked very stressed. Same non service for the man that came in afterwards. There was only one customer ahead of us whos order she was preparing."}
{"text":"i was really excited to have a tropical smoothie location closer to my home, but this location BY FAR is the worst. extremely understaffed & lacking in customer service. I have only visited a handful of times hoping that each experience might be a littler better, but i'm always left disappointed. food & smoothies arent to satisfaction, i ordered a wrap & there was HARDLY anything in it. it resembled a small taco! I waited approx 35 mins & all I ordered was a smoothie & a wrap. the customers AFTER me even got their food first!

I feel for the one or two workers that i usually see that are alone busting their butts because they are working alone, manning EVERY single area of the store. I will not be visiting this location again, until there is better service & more employees. this is a new store, you're supposed to attract customers, not push them away. horrible!"}
{"text":"Having more than 1 or 2 employees during the busiest times of the day/ adult supervision will probably benefit your business."}
{"text":"The drive thru literally is the WORST. 15-20 minute wait and is ridiculous. Same with the employees. They take their time and spend it just talking. Very inconvenient."}
{"text":"Worst establishment ever. Seems to always have a bunch of teenagers running the place. I come here frequently, but have recently stopped because EVERY SINGLE TIME I order a smoothie it tastes like 90% ice with a hint of flavor. They are slow and don't know how to multi task. I've been to other locations with no issues on the taste of smoothie or service.

Last time I was there, there was a cashier and one person in the back doing who knows what. I placed an order and then the cashier took another order from the customer behind me. Ok, that's fine, but then a third customer walked up and proceeded to stand there to decide what she wanted. Cashier stood there, not saying a word, for nearly 5 minutes (I took note of the time because I was on my way to work), instead of politely asking the customer to take their time deciding and making the two smoothies that had already been placed. 

Get a smoothie elsewhere."}
{"text":"This Tropical Smoothie is conveniently located right across the street from Las Vegas Athletic Club in the same lot as Target. Although there are plenty of Tropical Smoothie Cafe's in town, this one has great deals!

1. Buy 2 get 1 free smoothies are available every day from 5-7 PM.

2. 10% off of your order if you're a LVAC member. Just remember to flash your card!

3. 24 hour drive-thru. Awesome for those that like to work out at 3 AM. 

The only thing I don't like about this location is that the same smoothie tastes different depending on who makes it. I always get the Sunrise Sunset but seems to change in taste every other time I order it."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Nobody answers the phone and the cashier ( Cody) didn't say hi when I did and was soooo slow and rude. He did not say a word to the 5 people who were ordering just staring Didn't ask for my name just staring and waiting me to say something. Who hires these people?? I would never come back to this place even though I like the smoothies."}
{"text":"Great food and smoothies but why does it always take so long? I waited 15 mins for 1 smoothie and there were only 2 orders ahead of mine. Maybe hire more permanent staff (every time I go it's someone different) and make sure they can do basic math- the cashier miscounted my change. She was nice once I brought it to her attention though."}
{"text":"Love TSC, but not the bad experiences that happen often. I tried to do my usual phone call ahead of time for my order. No answer for 3 calls. I get there, not very busy. I try calling the store while in it, and don't hear a ring. Was it unhooked?! The location was dirty inside, as was the restroom."}
{"text":"Dont ever plan on getting in & out quickly. You MUST have a good amount time if you plan on coming here. They take foreverrrrr."}
{"text":"This is the slowest drive thru in the entire valley. Food is ok, smoothies are good, people are nice. Just service is slowwwwww. 

Wrote that^ while i was waiting in the drive thru. Which took 20mins. Then I got Tacos in stead of my wrap and no chips, had to walk in to get it fixed. Which defeated the purpose of going through the drive through. Lady that helped me was clueless and waited for my wrap which took another 10 mins. If I had time for a half hour lunch I would've sat down somewhere and enjoyed myself. Poor service. No manager on duty at 2pm by the way."}
{"text":"Online it says open 24hrs and so does the lit sign on the front window, but we show up at 11pm and its locked up and lights are off..."}
{"text":"Not friendly, clean or happy. Smoothie was good. People making it need to smile."}
{"text":"Friendly Service and Tasty Treats!

Today was my first trip into this location. Both ladies I interacted with were polite and friendly. The smoothies I got hit the spot!

All in all Tropical Smoothie is a reliable source for tasty goodness...

I recommend the Chia Peanut Butter Smoothie!"}
{"text":"Love Tropical Smoothie Cafes

I love tropical smoothie cafés and they are definitely one of my favorite go to places for a breakfast on the go.

This location is very convenient for me when I making my way through in the morning. I also really like the Williamsfield location where the staff is always extra friendly. 

My favorite breakfast treat is the Chia banana with peanut butter smoothie. I tend to like to call it the Chia pet smoothie with bananas.

I also like the breakfast wraps and the lunch sandwiches. They give you a little bit of a deal when you get the food along with the smoothie so it's very affordable and delicious!

Stop by and give them a taste, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Superb Service and Great Food At Good Prices!

This was my second trip on here and I am sold... the service is always super friendly here and the food is really good. 

I had the Bahamas mama smoothie again and it was great at usual. 

I ordered the Thai chicken wrap for my breakfast snack and it was 

All in all this replaced Jamba Juice as my go to smoothie shop..."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed the smoothies and healthy food from Tropical Smoother. I absolutely love the Jamaican Jerk sauce on the wraps and the Smoothies are better priced and healthier than this from Jamba Juice. Although they are usually around $8-10 for a meal I still go often because of the quality. I'm grateful for places like these so we aren't all stuck eating fast food on the daily."}
{"text":"Although I can't complain much about my smoothie, because it was actually pretty delicious, this place sucks. The staff is very rude and un-welcoming 100 percent of the time. They are also very lazy. The place was a pig sty. Every table was dirty with people just standing around in the back. What a shame."}
{"text":"The muscle blaster smoothie with whey protein is delicious! Despite the fact that it was really busy when I went in it came out quickly. Very good smoothies. The restaurant itself is clean."}
{"text":"There's no option to post this review without adding a star so you guys get the pity 1 star from me.

Do yourself a favor and DO NOT go here. 


Why is this place still open anyway? 

I should have checked yelp reviews before trying to get into this maze type  drive thru!

I'm trapped for almost an hour now. Way to go guys!"}
{"text":"WHERE'S MANAGEMENT? Don't they check for quality control anymore. Unfortunately this place like their sister stores are not what they used to be. Cannot get an Island Green made properly for the past 4 times at this store and you can forget about the one on Horizon Ridge. Look at the picture of my Island Green...it looks like pea soup and tastes like s**t"}
{"text":"Good stuff! Little overpriced but it tastes nice. Haven't had any problems here. Most of the locations here have closed so it's almost the only one left!"}
{"text":"I have had it with the tropical smoothie at this location.  My daughter and I have dealt with less than satisfactory service on many occasions.  Today I the girl handed me my smoothie with a lid that popped off.  The island green smoothie spilled all over my white sweater, shirt and down my side of my seat in my car! She hands me two napkins and says oh sorry.  Why on earth would she not check the lid prior to handing it over.  Now my sweater is ruined and I will have to pay to get my seat shampooed.  I don't recommend going to this location."}
{"text":"I was here yesterday. First and foremost, I just want to make a comment on how filthy dirty this place is. I shouldn't have stayed, but I did. There was not one area of the place that didn't have some level of filth. I was mortified. The glass had bad streaks on it and looked like it had just been wiped with water, it had a dirty smell, and my smoothie had a watered down taste. I will never go into this one again. There was trash on one of the tables that hadn't been cleaned up. There are way cleaner and nicer Tropical Smoothie's in town and I highly recommend going to them."}
{"text":"The wait here was horrible.  I was trying out Tropical Smoothie Cafe and got the Lean Machine. I asked what their Turbinado additive was and I was NOT impressed either.

The \"Lean Machine\" drink was OK. Not worth the 15 minute wait... AND they weren't even busy.  I was warned my by friends about this place, but tried it anyway.

The guy at the counter was not very friendly either.

Never coming here again."}
{"text":"Majority of the 1 star reviews are based on their wait time and I completely understand that because I too, had to wait in the drive thru for approximately 10 minutes BUT I'm giving tonight 3 stars because my smoothies were delish! AND there was only 1 person working! Yes, one! She was working both drive thru and front counter so I couldn't be angry with the wait time. I'd rather wait for smoothies that were made right rather than ones that were rushed."}
{"text":"When I asked him why, he was rude and I said you're the manager right? He said with an attitude \" nope owner!\" As he threw his card on the counter and full pen to sign my receipt. Rude. Bad service, I won't go back"}
{"text":"Ok so I visited this Afternoon around 3:00 right when school had gotten out, the place was packed with students. There were about 12 people waiting when I walked in and about 18 by the time I left. At this time there was only one girl working! She was running around trying to catch up on the orders, and doing a great job considering the circumstance! This location needs better staffing, Immediately! #1 for the obvious reasons of having multiple employees during peak hours... #2 because there really shouldn't be a young lady working alone at any time! I work retail, and I applaud her (I Wish I had gotten her name) for hustling and doing a great job under this much pressure and dealing with rude impatient people. She is the only reason for anything over 1 star."}
{"text":"this is probably one of the worst smoothie joints in town that I have been to with my family. Ordered 2 simple smoothies and had to wait 30 minutes and on top of that we could not get a refund for the long wait due to a manager not being around. A girl named something like Alexia was very snotty and could care less about us and cared more about the drive-thru. Definitely won't be coming back here again, even the smoothies are mediocre."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The only thing this place has going for it is its open 24/7.

2 pieces of chicken in my $7 sandwich. Cool. Changed the recipe to less chicken and they also raised the prices."}
{"text":"***WARNING FOOD POISONING*** I ate here last night (7/9/17) with my girlfriend. We each had a smoothie & a chicken wrap. It's been almost 24 hours & we both still have major stomach pains & painful diarrhea.  The customer service was horrible from the guy with long dreads who wasn't wearing gloves or a hair net when he made our food after handling cash, equipment etc. Don't risk your health or waste your money at this joke of a restaurant. Health dept has been contacted."}
{"text":"Not sure why the bad reviews. Always had a pleasant experience at this location. Great customer service but a tad slow on making the food and drinks. Others than that, good spot. Jamaican Jerk Chicken wrap is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Yikes. They don't know how to run a business... Line out the door and employees yelling at each other that they need breaks. I love the tropical smoothies company but I won't be coming to this location in the future. One employee just got back from break and didn't wash her hands!"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with the smoothies at Tropical Smoothie Cafe. The first times at Tropical Smoothie, I would always get the Sunrise Smoothie and today I had the blue lagoon. The blue lagoon consist of blue berries and bananas I know it had a little more butn I can't exactly remember."}
{"text":"The girl behind the counter was very nice with a bubbly personality. I enjoyed the recommendation of the mocha madness and on top of that, you can have veggie chicken if you prefer. Looks like I'll be stopping by here again. A warm reception is always welcomed and appreciated. This is what makes you come back for more. 

The drinks are a bit on the sweet side. The island green states it has lots of green's but it wasn't like a normal kale shake. Had some zest and flavor. An interesting mix. 

The other drink, Mocha Madness was a nice blend of coffee and chocolate. A bit on the icy side. And in all this is a place to check out again."}
{"text":"Besides the wait, everything is great.  I'm learning there's usually a wait when u have a higher quality food.  I have eaten here daily for the past 3 weeks and feel great with tons of energy.  It's my new addiction."}
{"text":"This was my first time not being satisfied with my service at this location. I was the third car in line at the drive through and waited 15 minutes. Once I approached the intercom I was not greeted. I waited 5 minutes saying hello with no response. I pulled up and saw no one at the window so I assumed they didn't hear me at intercom. I saw two customers inside (who was actually the car in front of me) shrugging and mouthing to me that no one was assisting. Worried I went inside to make sure everyone was ok. We went around the corner the girl jumped back fast and they both proceeded out adjusting their headphones. As they fixed our drinks, they laughed, they didn't apologize nor explain our wait. I love tropical smoothie and the great service they provide military but I was highly disappointed with the customer service I received from Marcus and Jade."}
{"text":"Omg idk who works they day shift this was the worst experience I had in my life at tropical Smoothie Cafe I came in at 12:00pm to order a salad and detox smoothie it's 12:40 I'm still here waiting this is unbelievable very poor staff and management."}
{"text":"My first time here and not real impressed. The strawberry banana smoothie was very good but the chicken salad sandwich was disappointing! The chicken salad was very dry but the bread was worse. It was clearly very old bread or was left out so the air dried it out. I might go back for a smoothie but not to eat."}
{"text":"So came during happy hour today & one of the employees was taking some lady's order while she was scratching her lip with her false nails then started scratching her head too! She then finished taking the lady's order then went to the back to make her smoothie without washing her hands or anything even after handling money! So disgusting & when I got my smoothie it tasted like peanut butter!? But I didn't order anything with peanut butter. On top of that the customer service is ehhh. Overall I'd rather just go to Jamba & I would save your time & do the same rather than come here."}
{"text":"Im not a fan of leaving bd reviews but to wait 30mins to get service is kinda insane with one person in line. And by the time its your turn no genuine care or sorry for the wait. Smh"}
{"text":"I would like to update my review because hours of me writing the email to management about my complaint I received a response from the manager and she was more than happy to fix the issue which of course I greatly appreciate. She was responsive and came up with two solutions for me to choose from. Thanks Alana from Management!"}
{"text":"Smoothies are good but the wait is ridiculous! Earlier today I waited 25 minutes in the drive thru. This is not an exception it is the general rule here. Sad to say I can no longer visit this place due to to obscene wait time at all hours of the day. Read the other reviews more than 1/2 say the same thing!"}
{"text":"Smoothies and food are yummy for sure but service doesn't know how to listen. I ordered the king Caesar wrap with no tomatoes because I'm allergic, with dressing on the side because they put way too much in the wrap and what do I get? Everything that I asked modifications on. What a waste of $7!!!!!  They don't accommodate people who ask for specific things. never going to this location again. Or maybe this specific person just doesn't know how to listen."}
{"text":"Came in for my free yearly birthday smoothie and it was delicious!!! Clean and courtesy staff and quick service!! I'm not a huge smoothie fan but when I want one this is the place to go!!"}
{"text":"Horrible management. Understaffed and poor service. 20-30 min wait is regular during peak times for a simple wrap and a Smoothie. Avoid unless u like being overcharged for mediocre food."}
{"text":"I came Sunday afternoon around 245 3 p.m. and I didn't leave until 3:45 the young man Afro-American looked at me and didn't even say hi took my order and didn't even ask a single question look like he was in a whole different world and he didn't know a single thing he was doing he seriously took an hour and for drinks maybe even five before me for two separate people I had me my son and his mother waiting and waiting and waiting and this drinks weren't even that great at all he made them half ass and it wasn't even worth $20 for three drinks no way I am very very dissatisfied with the services and to top it all off I can't even get a hold of a manager to speak with them over this because their phone when you call go straight to voicemail I don't live on that side of town but I will never ever go to that Tropical Smoothie again and waste my time and my money unemployed who could give a butt less about his employment please take care of this I can't wait until I can talk to somebody because they will be notified by me that this was the worst ever in my history of going to a tropical smoothie"}
{"text":"The cashier Mark with the dreads is not welcoming at all.. didn't even acknowledge me he said \"wassup\" bad customer service, it's my first time ever coming to this location, he's service makes me not want to come back at all. Smoothie is very good though."}
{"text":"What happened? Went to the. Commerce/ Simons location and it was closed. Sign on door said opens at 6am, yelp says opens at 8:00. We were there at 7:30 and the place was closed p tight. Better get. Ew employees. 
       Blimey( I love the )Limey. Great on a Sunny Las Vegas day. I'm from the northwest so it's always a hot day in North Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately the staff's consistent piss poor attitude and lack of any desire to be friendly, welcoming or accommodating drive me to write this. I literally just walked out at 3 pm on a Sunday. I walked in to order three large smoothies. The three female staff looked up, saw me, said nothing and turned back around. 
I stood at the counter for 5 minutes until I threw the menu down and walked out. It is very off putting as I want to give this place a chance, another posts have said, over and over. Last week the staff was GREAT and apologized for the past issues (manager was out etc) Today nothing further from that. The food and smoothies are always great. Staffing is killing it."}
{"text":"I was totally blown away by this little gem of a restaurant in the Promenade! I had a coupon and local friends told me I should try it. I am so glad I did! Their smoothie menu is extensive but try the food; it is on point! The flavors are bright and fresh and everything is made fresh when you order. I have been back many times since my initial visit because Kevin and his crew are so welcoming and go out of the way to make sure you are taken care of! The fish tacos and chicken luau flatbread are sooo good! You have to try their AMAZING smoothies, too! Everything is reasonably priced, as well. I have not tried everything yet, but give me time! They keep me coming back! LOL!"}
{"text":"Healthy smoothies and food choices. Delicious! I go here and the other store in South Charlotte. Good people, too."}
{"text":"Well, at least they make smoothies. I've been here about 20 times and I can say one thing without a doubt, the service is terrible. Don't get me wrong, the staff is always friendly, but it takes such a long time to order and get your smoothie. I've had to pull out of the drive-thru twice because the employee told me \"one moment\" then 5 mins later came back and said \"thank your for your patience, just a few more moments\" then didn't come back for 10 min...and I was the only person in the drive-thru!!!!  This was a Sunday afternoon. This isn't an isolated instance, this has happened several times, at several different times of the day on several different days. I don't know if it's not busy enough to warrant more employees or what, but if you go and have to wait, just know that's normal at this location.  The smoothies themselves are hit or miss as well, sometimes you get a good one and other times you get a bland, half-blended mess. No consistency, other than consistently slow."}
{"text":"Gross.  Filthy.  Health Hazard. No Real Management.  I stopped at Warm Springs and Eastern on 1/12 for something to drink.  Three girls.  Black girl working very hard by herself in the back, the other two talking. Order drink, wait, nothing is happening, then the girl sitting down behind the cash register gets up and decided to make my drink.  I thought the girl in the back was making it, I have no idea why I waited before this one got up.  She did not wash her hands.  Rinses out a blender with water from a hand sink, uses her bare hands to get an open orange and banana and out and place in the blender.  I questioned if this was sanitary, and the other white girl said it was. She had a good personality.  Then the other one decides my shake is not right so she starts to add more ice after it was done. I looked at the filthy floor, the dirty blue tile on the wall, and thought best to lose $5.00 then to get sick and lose a weeks work.  Keep my $5.00.  I will never be back."}
{"text":"too poor to eat here but when i do i never regeret it haha delicious smootheis galore"}
{"text":"I've been coming here right after my Jabz workout down the building for a month. I get the peanut butter flavored Chia Banana Boost smoothie. Always a winner!

Great friendly fast service and delicious smoothies!"}
{"text":"Although this smoothies are very good and the lunches are decent the reason for the three stars is the service is so slow. Have been there a couple of times and a brief lunch should be quicker than you can get here.I recommend ordering in advance and getting to go or eating there. Also the one on Mayo delivers if that's an option for you."}
{"text":"Ah, yes...Tropical Smoothie. I wanted to like you, I really did. But when I came in and your staff of 3 unhelpful and rude teenagers glared at me for forcing them to labor for their pay I knew any chance at us having a thing were unlikely at best. I placed an order for two smoothies and two sandwiches. Pretty basic stuff, no? Well it turns out the answer is indeed, no. They got everything wrong and failed to apologize for their mistake. They simply remade the order. No refund was offered, no apology, nothing. I won't return to this location."}
{"text":"Very easy to order. Fast service. Great price for their combos. Brent took my order and was very friendly. Even knew me when I picked up the order. Southwest wrap was delicious."}
{"text":"Although the smoothies are rather pricey, the combo deals are great if you're their for lunch! I love their selection of smoothies and food items as well as the fact that you can sit down inside and enjoy your lunch or just grab a smoothie to start your day!"}
{"text":"Worst tropical smoothie ever!! Bunch of lazy workers. Got a thai chicken salad that ive been getting from different locations all the same except this one. Just threw the salad and chicken in there. No cilantro no spinach no sesame seeds no carrotts no scallions. Very upset will call corporate. Also workers not in uniform. Also ordered a island green smoothie which we always order tasted watered down even when we brought it back in."}
{"text":"Third time I have shown up to this Tropical Smoothie and their lights are turned off when they are suppose to be OPEN. Clearly the workers don't want to work so they turn the lights off. Go inside and it REEKED. Smelled like expired SOMETHING. I went no later than 10pm. It's annoying. I've seen some of the workers outside while the sign is off smoking then go inside when they see me and they smell making my smoothie. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Probably the most consistent smoothies chain. I like that they post calories. They are a little expensive and the girls working the counter don't always seem like they care all that much. Service is generally quick and I like their frequent customer card. All in all, you could do a lot worse."}
{"text":"I love their meat-free chicken, every time I get a wrap with it, it tastes so good, perfectly seasoned!"}
{"text":"They take waaay too long here& its mostly like a hit or miss because sometimes they mess up the smoothies.. last time I went here.. The line at the drive thru was almost 15 mins long! Whats the point of a drive thru if youre gonna just take your sweet ass time to make it. 

Also, after the 15 min wait, I saw the girl texting on her phone.. O.o when she opened the window,no smile&no customer service ..   

There was also a time before that, my mom & I went through the same 15 minute wait drive through& when we got our smoothies it was so gross.. No sweetener.. It just tasted so bitter! 
 Its the closest trop smoothie by my house & I loathe going here when I want my fix.. i'd rather go to another location."}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff are always fast with making your orders, they are polite and professional! 
I always get the peanut butter cup smoothie. Very delicious. 

Also this location is always clean."}
{"text":"Great food and service but clean your disgusting drive up window. It is absolutely gross, see picture."}
{"text":"Smoothies and sandwiches at this location are hit or miss. Also, I went here 2 nights in a row after working out at LVAC and both times the staff were ridiculously unfriendly... I wasn't annoyed, in fact, I thought it was kinda entertaining because they seemed to really hate their jobs lol"}
{"text":"This location has a drive-thru which is nice, but don't count on it being any faster. I have actually been told that they needed more time before taking my order. 
I haven't had food from Tropical Smoothie in years so I can't speak to that, but the smoothies are always good. You can absolutely make one at home for cheaper (they're about $7 if you add any supplements or nutritional add-ins), but if you need a quick snack, it's not bad in a pinch. My favorite is the Blimey Limey, and I like to add the vitamin C immune supplement for a little boost every now and then. They do have kids sizes of both the smoothies and meals, but I think the kids menu consists of a smaller selection. I have never had bad service here, but like I said it can be slow at times."}
{"text":"Yummy food but the store is always packed with customers and not enough people working. 2 workers max and it's very inconvenient to wait 30 minutes for food."}
{"text":"Definitely not the \"A\" team on a Monday lunch shift.  Definite lack of leadership. Food was mediocre.  Smoothie was great! However, everyone seems confused even the customers."}
{"text":"Anna is such a sweetheart!! We were thinking of trying something new and asked her about the avocado smoothie (which has avocado, coconut, lime, spinach, kale, and some other ingredients) and she said it is a must try. She even offered to make us another smoothie if we didn't like it. Her customer service is amazing and we will definitely be back :) thanks Anna!"}
{"text":"I've always loved Tropical Smoothie. Always been my favorite place to get a fresh smoothie and a healthy snack.

lately i've noticed a trend with all locations i've been going to and this one was the last culprit.

two stars because the food tasted good but when it takes 25 minutes from order time to getting food in a drive thru something really needs to be fixed. 

to give a little more context, there was one car in front of us with a small order and no one inside the dining area. definitely won't be returning to this location. You shouldn't have a drive thru if it takes longer to get food than it does at most sit down restaurants."}
{"text":"Came in just past 7pm on a Sunday and they're out of their substitute veggie meat? And out of watermelon? Specialty drink is currently watermelon based and they ran out? What poor management, I'll be bringing my $9.86 after tax somewhere else"}
{"text":"This franchise lacks quality service standards. The employees were nice enough but the employee prepping the orders was too preoccupied by his friends in the store to work efficiently. Food and smoothies are still good, just the time it took for everything to be made was terrible."}
{"text":"Can some one please tell WTF is going on with Tropical Smoothie Café PLACE's ???? They are horrible with the service and everything else.... I just waited for 20  almost 30 min at the drive threw and I get to the window and the guy ask for my order again ..... Can you believe my order still was not made and he still had the nerve to be rude when I asked him if he was serious he didn't tell me I had to ask if my order was still not made.... Omg I couldn't believe this ...... I love tropical Smoothie so much  but I am really starting to think it time to let them go for good because it seems like they care about the customer at all like we are on their time. Smh"}
{"text":"I came in for my mobile order and when I got there I was greated by an employee by the name of Robert . The first thing he said to me was I was unable to place an order because he was in the middle of a shift change. The I mention to him that it was a mobile order and he then said oh I didn't get a chance to do that order I had a rough night shift. So I said okay just put my money back on my card and he then when on and said he didn't know how to do that again he had a rough night and was unable to give me my money back . So of course at this point I am a little upset, so I place an order online and then get to the location and then told by Robert I had to wait even longer until he was done with his shift change. Which is the reason why I did a mobile order way before I left my house. Minutes later the female employee comes out with my order , now my order is now thing like what I ordered so I take back and she tells me that the reason why was because there was no avocado, so my question is how do I order an Avacalada but there is no avocado in it they didn't even mention they had ran out of avocado when I got there , so maybe I could have changed my order before I even order it .... so then I got the banana Chia and the smoothie was so nasty it tasted like old bananas the nastiest after taste ever at this point I didn't even try to go in to change it a 3 rd time . This was the last straw for this place, I used to come every day and slowly I had just given up on this place and today after 3-4 months later of not coming here, I  I decided to give it a 2,3 and 4 th ect.  chance and  again I realized why I stop coming here in the first place. This location is out of control the company constantly have new employee and it seem like there never fully trained it crazy. Oh not to mention the employee Robert on my way out didn't forget to say out loudly \" I hope you have a better day\" Like I am sorry I was having a awesome day until I got here and was told my order didn't get done because he had a rough night and I had to wait even longer because he had to shift change first. I couldn't believe his way of going about customer service, I as a manager would have been super embarrassed if I heard one of my employee treat a customer they way he did. Not to mention he also turned away like 3 customers in the time I was there waiting on my order. This place is bad all the way around not even the cleanness is bad it used to be descent now it just disgusting..... But again this was definitely my last time here. Don't waist your money here or time .... this place gets negative stars...."}

{"text":"Every time I come i have to wait forever in the drive thru which barely has any cars. I thought the first couple of times that I came at a busy time but it's just like this every time. I shouldn't have to wait in a drive thru for almost an hr"}
{"text":"Every time I go in there, they are understaffed, out of ingredients, and I never get consistency with my smoothies.  Also the tip jar doesn't go to the employees, rather to a \"charity.\"  Highly suspect.  Won't be going again unless they make some changes."}
{"text":"Came in with a large order. Was not that busy. But service was a little slow. But hey they are making smoothies made to order. People were friendly as well. Including a girl named Jasmine who helped even though I don't think she even clocked in yet. Smoothies were good flavorful and the larger order was all correct. Thx guys."}
{"text":"Jeff is the guy that would satisfy your needs , 
Late night after playing soccer with the guys refreshing smoothie . Tip him $2 for a delicious smoothie. We will be coming back again. Also it looks closed but it's not go to drive through they are there . To take your order #happycustomer"}
{"text":"You can't call in your order because OTHER people haven't picked up their orders in the past. You can place the order and then wait on them to make it after you get to the store. Which COMPLETELY DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF CALLING IN! What a terrible management decision. How many people have MOT chosen to eat there because of this? Completely inconvenient and a waste of time for a mediocre meal at best."}
{"text":"Don't even bother going online or to the app to look at the menu or prices. PRICES ARE WRONG. Their menu IS NOT updated so odds are, what you want to order, isn't even sold here anymore. I called my order ahead and still had to wait for it to be prepared (& then re-made) when I got there."}
{"text":"I have been to this location 3 times. I love me some trop smo, but sheesh the service here is the worst every time. They are understaffed, meaning only one person is working here usually. 

I wait 15 plus minutes at the drive-thru and that's a conservative estimate.. It wouldn't be so bad if the girl working actually pretended to like her job and smiled maybe...I don't blame her if she's having to pull the shifts by herself (if that's the case). She's usually way too busy to even remember to give you all of your order. Literally, the wait it so long, I forget what I ordered until I get home and I'm like oh snap...she forgot to give us..... whatever. If there is more than one car in the drive-thru...keep driving. You just saved 30 minutes...you're welcome.

Also: Purchased a soda here once and noticed it was flat. Yes, it was expired. Check your soda expiration dates.
Good luck fellow trop smo lovers."}
{"text":"Love this place. I always get the Island Green smoothie no banana with no sugar. I feel great after I eat here. I also always order the Flat bread pesto chicken...just the right amount of food. Sometimes I order 2 smoothies and put one in the freezer and eat it like ice cream the next day. Taste just as great as when it's just made. They also have a discount card thing that you accumulate every time you purchase.....once you earn enough your eligible for a free item."}
{"text":"great smoothies and quick at this location. They need to up their cleanliness inside the dining area. Always dirty tables and paper on the floors. Also, keep the front windows clean."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious but watch out with the Asian lady that prepares your order... if the order is wrong she gets an attitude if she gets it wrong.. also the girls that take your order are new sometimes and slow"}
{"text":"Don't go to this place. There is no customer service I had to wait 10 minutes before anybody said anything to me for it to be a fruit smoothie place my fruit smoothie was almost was a very very light pink and no flavor."}
{"text":"Extremely dirty and hand washing sink is broken. I was at this location today and I order $17 worth of smoothies for my family. 

First, they have a \"B\" rating from the health district. 

Second, the employee hand washing sink is broken and no one washed their hands the entire time we were there. 

Third, the employee taking the money (handling cash and coins) would randomly touch almost finished smoothies and food products right after touching money. 

It was too late to ask for a refund and we ended up trashing all the smoothies. $17 dollar donation to a dirty tropical smoothie cafe I guess. 

DO NOT GO HERE. It is dirty!"}
{"text":"Obsessed with the smoothies here especially the chocolate and peanut butter one! I actually like it better then Jamba Juice which is surprising to me! They have some good food choices as well!"}
{"text":"I strongly dislike coming to this tropical smoothie because of how long it takes to be helped in the drive through 9 times out of 10 its a 15 to 25 minute wait. Sometimes it may be just one person working NOT okay. Others im not sure what's going on. Because I know its going to take forever I rather drive to a different location!"}
{"text":"The smoothies are never a let down and I'm never afraid to try something new here. I love the Acai Berry Boost the best! 
They need more people to work during lunch hours. No one should have to wait 15 minutes for a smoothie...I come here when I'm in a hurry and it defeats the purpose of a \"quick trip\".... Hopefully they'll read this!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. I got here when no one was in line and it still took them 20 Minutes to get ONE sandwich done. Are you kidding me?! And they kept giving me the wrong side order. Plus with major attitude on the side with this cashier rolling her eyes at me. Maybe if you got my order right and not over half my break time, I wouldn't have such a problem. Ran by bratty high school children who need a major attitude adjustment. I've gone to bigger places with longer lines without having to wait this long."}
{"text":"We received some coupons in the mail for this place and thought we would try it out.  We got the sunset smoothie, it was OK.  Not great but not terrible.   They only offer 1 size of smoothie which is unfortunate. 

We also ordered 2 wraps.  The Southwest wrap is on their menu but I guess they don't make it anymore which was weird.  I ordered the Buffalo Wrap and my girl ended up with the Thai wrap.  My buffalo wrap was bland with a very salty tasting buffalo sauce.  Little bit of chicken.  The Thai wrap had all the sauce in 1 spot and was also bland.

Overall it was OK.  The experience was not great. Super slow service and the lobby was filthy. Literally trash everywhere and broken tables.  

I was excited to see they had healthy food but disappointed after trying it.  For 1 Smoothie and 2 wraps it came out to $15 and that's only because I had a 50% off 1 wrap coupon. 

Probably won't go again."}
{"text":"I've been here about 5 times in the past month and a half. It's the closest smoothie place to my house so very convenient HOWEVER every single time- the service is super shitty, I'm not one to complain very much but today was the last straw. We ordered then pulled up to the window- it was a solid 5-7 minutes before the cashier even opened the window and when she did all she said was \"$11.87\"... not a \"sorry about that, we're super swamped today I apologize for the wait. How are you today?\" Nothing. Handed her $12 and she took it and closed the window, opened it again handed me my change and the smoothies and shut the window again. No thank you or have a nice day... I'm done with this place, I will drive to a further smoothie place like Jamba Juice"}
{"text":"Management, I hope you're reading!! Your staff is terrible. I refrained from writing a review for this location until I've been here enough times to be sure. I have come in on a few occasions and just stand there at the counter. All of your employees see me. Not one person says \"someone will be with you shortly\" or anything of the sort. My last time I waited 7 minutes before the girl came to the counter. She didn't even say \"oh I'm sorry about that.\" Damn horrible service, staff!! Lucky I like your Get Up and Goji otherwise I wouldn't put up with this crap. Fire your whole crew!"}

{"text":"I used to really like eating here and enjoyed the smoothies as well. Recently I went for a visit and got a hummus burritos which was ok but the smoothie came to be disappointing. I got a detox on and I'm not sure why it wasn't tasty as I drink smoothies on the regular. The next day I got a hummus Bowl which I would give a 3/10 rating. I asked for extra rice and beans but 90% of it was lettuce. I just feel like I did not get my money's worth. I got an avocalada smoothie that I used to absolutely love but this time around it tastes like something I did not recognize. It's possible that it may be because I added a matcha supplement but I'm not sure. Customer service was great, but food on the other hand was not"}
{"text":"This is the 3rd year I've worked right down the street from this place, and this morning I'm trying their mocha smoothie.  Normally I get the Blimey Limey - but needed some caffeine today and this is just delicious.  The service is always friendly, and even when they're busy they manage to pump out the drinks quickly.  I'm somewhat partial 'cause I have a guy on my team who is addicted to these, so when I'm craving one it normally gets delivered straight to my desk... if you like smoothies, you'll dig this joint."}
{"text":"Out of all the tropical smoothies this has to be the cleanest and the best. The stephanie location is terrible not even worth going inside. Last two times I went the service was awful not to mention they had a c rating. This tropical smoothie blows all of the other ones in Henderson out of the water. Their smoothies are tasty and their wraps are fresh. The service here is great and they don't take long as suggested in the other reviews. If you go in before 11:30 hardly anyone waiting."}
{"text":"Worst customer service waited in line well over 30 minutes with a text stating and offer without a limit per person or per car in the text offer, then they said they wouldn't honor the text. They then said they weren't even making even one of the items we asked for and said if I don't pull threw the drive threw that they would call the cops. I then got to the window asked for a manager they stayed they were out of her cards and I then asked for name and contact information for manager and she said the number is on the website and her name is Asia I don't even know her last name. Shocking the employees don't even know their managers name or how to treat a customer. Will never return to this location again and will be submitting a complaint to the corporate office about this franchise business that carries their brand. This goes to show franchise owned businesses can do and treat their customers however they like. - the one on Simmons and centennial is was nicer newer and great customer service this location is just terrible  ."}
{"text":"Fucking horrible service . 
Cashier didn't know ANYTHING . Over charged me 2X . Then was really rude when my daughter asked for the water we ordered ."}
{"text":"I will NEVER make the mistake of going to this location again or ANY Tropical Smoothie for that matter. I pulled into the drive thru at 6:02 and finally at 6:28 (there is no way to exit the drive through) 26 MINUTES LATER!!! had to drive off without getting my order. I clocked in late to work due to this absurd wait time. I tried to call to see if there was any way they could pull cars to the side to wait. RANG and Rang and Rang. Other reviews say the exact same thing. Terrible experience!!!! NEVER going back!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love that Tropical Smoothie is 24 hours perfect for late night cravings or a late/early work out. The food is great and the smoothies are usually great I just wish there was a little more consistency and less of a \"it depends who makes it.\"

Some employees I've encountered have had exceptional customer service and they're the reason I go back! Every place will have its drawbacks but overall very satisfied with this business!"}
{"text":"I always rock with the Jamaican jerk wrap and a smoothie.. I add the protein and fiber. Usually grab a bite from there after I hit the gym. I would recommend."}
{"text":"For a place that's always busy you'd think they wouldn't ignore phone calls for pre orders. Instead I have to sit and wait for 15-20 minutes for my $6-$7 dollar drink while the crew move slower then turtles with 1 person in front of me.

Bad attitudes and dirty looks are not appropriate. 
I will not be returning. I'd rather drive 10 extra minutes to a drive through at another location which has my drink ready in less then 1 minute and I'm always greeted with a smile."}
{"text":"Tried this yesterday with my wife for breakfast, and was not disappointed.  I went with the avacolada and here I am again today enjoying another one.  Avocado smoothie?  Who would have thought?  Sandwiches and wraps are also great as we had the southwest omelette and today I had the chicken salad half with my smoothie.  My only wish is I could get half a wrap with my smoothie. Ah well as long as this smoothie is around, I'll be around."}
{"text":"I usually come here every Saturday in the early, early morning with s group of friends to grab breakfast before we go out and hike. The food selection here, or I guess at any Tropical Smoothie is sort of guilt-free, tastey, &, conveniently for us, along the way to our hiking spots! 

Because we're here pretty often, I see the same faces working and I know it's early, I KNOW, but we, the customers, are always the ones greeting them good morning. Hm. 

That's not too big of a deal though, what bugs me is that the last two times I ate here my spinach and feta wrap was cold in the middle (first one) and the second time it was still cold at the bottom. We were already headed toward the hike while eating in the car so I couldn't turn around and ask them to make me a new one or finish heating it so it bugged me enough to not want to come here anymore. Not just because MY food was cold, but another friend of mine ordered a spinach and feta wrap as well and HIS was still cold.

But here I am, ready for another hike and this restaurant is conveniently located near us & since it's open so early, we stopped by anyway. Although I'm not giving their spinach and feta wrap another shot, I decided to go for a peanut butter crunch flatbread. I didn't really like this one either, it had peanut butter that was an inch thick, like they took a spoon and slapped it all on there. I didn't finish it and threw it away.

I gave this place so many chances. I think this will be the last time I order from this Tropical Smoothie."}
{"text":"Trust these reviews. My first time at this location was yesterday and I was in the drive thru for 13 minutes for a wrap & a smoothie AND I was the first & only customer in their drive thru. It also wasn't until after the 12 minute mark that they came to the window, I was not greeted or even told hello, or given a smile. Just *opens window* \"$8.00.\" Wtf? Okay. I smiled & said hello, assuming she needed the smile more than I did. No receipt, no napkins.

I decided to give it a second chance today and their DT speaker had a sign that said no cards bc the system is down, cash only. Again, I was the first and only in line. I made my order, the same as yesterday, and proceeded to the window. 9 minute wait time and \"$7.53.\" Again, I smiled & said hello (this was a different woman this time) and you'd think they would return the greeting? Anyway, I gave her a $100 bill and she said she had no change for that. I told her her sign said cash only since I can't use my card and she says \"I don't know what to tell you if I don't have change.\" So I took my money back, and left. I definitely won't be coming back to this location. No wonder they have such crappy reviews. They're all true."}
{"text":"Always very fast when I order for pick up. Great place for vegetarians! Only con is I wish their limited time only menu wasn't limited time only!"}
{"text":"There have been several times I've come in and waited for 20 minutes for one smoothie or they ran out of like everything I ever wanted; seriously soooo frustrating! 

However, there have been several MORE times where they just didn't fail to deliver. Literally, everything I've ever consumed has never disappointed! I love their options!"}
{"text":"Service is terrible, music loud, employess always hanging out in dining area with friends being really loud, not a good look for employees to be doing this. This has happened a few times at this location, may just have to start going to jamba, corporate should step in and do something. No surprise at the low rating"}
{"text":"Customer service is seriously lacking....3 people working @ 1:30 on 8/21...no one could take my order until 1:45.... Currently 1:54 and I am still waiting for my smoothie. Good thing I decided to grab a quick lunch :/"}
{"text":"Why are they always out of ingredients? Today they couldn't make the Chicken Apple Club because they were out of something. Then I order a superfood smoothie and they were out of almonds. Wow. Every single time I come here they are out of something. I come back for the smoothies, but this may be the last time, especially since the cashier gave me attitude when I was placing my order."}
{"text":"My wife and me have been regular customers of this place since they opened, almost a year if I recollect. For us it has been a blessing as we were both looking for healthier lifestyle options around the area. The service and quality have both been superb and I vouch being here at least 50 times till now. 

We alternate between Jamba and Tropical smoothie cafe as Tropical does not make fresh juices. For a family of 3 our bill at Jamba is around 20 in comparison we get 3 smoothies for 11 bucks at Tropical in their Happy Hour..... that is a big difference and anyone reading this knows that healthier food options are not cheap today. 

I've also tried their wraps and bowls at occasion and flavors/quality has been great. Great job Tropical keep it up and we will keep showing up :)"}
{"text":"Really really like their smoothies! Love that they have happy hour buy one get one free from 5-7 pm I believe. It tastes like homemade smoothie. I guess everyone has different taste but I really like that these taste fresh and not powdery! Blueberry bliss is sooo goooood! Very refreshing smoothies. I am going to go back to try some of their foods. Good service, a little on the slow side in drive thru but I think they can make it better!"}
{"text":"I'm so frustrated with Tropical smoothie! You wait for 10 min to place order only 2 people working. Takes another 14 min to get order. Those poor kids are understaffed. You'd think with the amount of business they could hire staff to meet the customer needs. Quick in$ out!"}
{"text":"I stopped in a while back ago for a smoothie and had a similar experience to the other 20+times I have been here. No reason to mention the food here. As others have clearly stated, smoothies and food are great. For a healthy, tasty option in the west valley, this is the spot. The place beats any competition in the area with no problem. The issue, as many and myself are saying, is the staff. This starts and ends with the management.  Who trains their young employees? Why does it appear no one is hear to guide them? Why does the place not operate well? Management! Management! Management! Every time I stop by the place it is filthy. Every time I stop by I question if my order will be charged correctly. Every time I stop by the wait time is in question. It's very disappointing that a place with such good bones is missing heart. I will no longer go here and will take my business elsewhere. Maybe it is time to bust out the home blender. I do not like to give one star reviews, but congrats to Tropical Smoothies, you have earned it. Over and over again!!!"}
{"text":"Food quality at this tropical smoothie is the worst. Their customer service is ok. They really need to retrained their employees on how to cool their items in their menu. I went to this loc at about 1140 and asked for a chicken wrap, the employee there said the chicken was frozen and that it would take at least 35 or so minutes to defrost. Really?? I hope they fix this problem and I can start going back as I am a fan of tropical smoothie."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times since I've moved to Avondale, at first it seemed like a great place that was open 24 hours where I could get a smoothie. Problem is, after several visits, I have come to expect a long wait for my order. My most recent experience resulted in a 15 minute wait for my smoothie, and then when I tasted it on my way home , I realize that it was obviously missing a key ingredient and tasted very bland. This would be a great place and I'm sure would have 5 star reviews on average every time if they would just figure out how to serve their customers properly with the products that they order, and have a staff training on customer service. Their customer service is very poor as a couple times I have also ordered drinks and subsequently waited several minutes,  only to be  skipped over, while people who came in after me received their orders. I am no longer going to visit this place, there is a one stop nutrition smoothie place across the way and I think I will give that a shot"}
{"text":"yum. so many smoothie options. next time i go to ikea, i'm hitting up TSC first!
i also love the caribbean luau flatbread - it's got a sweet spicy tangy jamaican inspired sauce. it is downright addicting. 
my fave smoothies are the antioxidant one and the sunrise sunset."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness , every person that worked here looked depressed. The mood in here compared to Jamba Juice is sooooooo different. If you don't like your job get a new one ! & please add another register , the lunch time crowd is way to busy to operate only on one register. Then I over heard customers asking Carlyn the cashier how she liked her job and she replied \" I don't , and I don't like some of the people I work with\" ... I'm sure they don't like you either Carlyn. It is never appropriate to say that out loud"}
{"text":"The smoothies are delicious and the sandwiches, wraps, and flatbreads are flavorful! 

As I've mentioned in other reviews, I am a creature of habit...so I usually get the Blimey Limey which is sooooo yummy!  On a recent visit, I stepped out of the box and ordered a Sunrise Sunset smoothie (of course I added LIME!) and it is now my new go-to smoothie.  

The Hummus Veggie wrap is super tasty, however I'll be asking for more hummus next time! 

Make sure you stop by! It's the perfect way to enjoy a healthy meal and a cool smoothie on a hot Arizona summer day!"}
{"text":"I came on my lunch break and was in the drive-thru line for 40 minutes (no joke, I counted). I finally got my strawberry limeade and you could barely taste the strawberry and not the lime AT ALL. I've never written a bad review about any business but this was warranted. Management needs to have a team meeting or something because the other reviews and mine are similar for good reason."}
{"text":"They never answer the damn phone. Why give people option to call order in if your not going to answer?"}
{"text":"This place must be the worst tropical smoothie on the planet. Let's start off with I had to go inside to order because two people were backing out of the drive thru. Waited 5 minutes to place order. Another  20 for the one smoothie. 4 people working and they look at you like you have horns on and we are working them to death. This was today's review, yesterday's was just as bad the poor girl gave me the smoothies, because I waited in drive thru 20 minutes after ordering, they also had no chickens prepped for salads. You barely have a menu how do you not have chicken. I wish the one by me was open however they are remodeling. Worst experience ever!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have had the BEST smoothies at the Carmel Road location! My favorite is the Avocado one. 
Last night, I had the Baja Chicken bowl and it was very good. I have also had excellent service!  Don't forget to tip your server too as that is a necessary part of their income!"}
{"text":"I love tropical smoothie as a smoothie place. I come often and never have a problem but this is the first time visiting this location and I'm not impressed. It's beautiful inside but coming at a time where they had no business, it took over 15 minutes for me to get my smoothie. I don't understand what took so long but the workers seemed lazy in their smoothie making and we're taking their time talking with eachother and hanging out. Also they were not friendly"}
{"text":"Went into Tropical Smoothie thinking of the \"healthy options\"...NOT.  After ordering two chicken wraps and a pomegranate plunge we were reading the Owners pamphlet on his creation of a \"healthy cafe.\"  Then we watched as our wraps came out of a microwave oven.  Upon questioning the cashier about the Microwaving of their food he told us that's the way they do it.  Since they boast about no grills, hoods or other costly equipment to help startup costs for franchisees...so where is the \"healthy\" in this cafe?  With 45g of sugars coming from turbinado sugar added for a total of almost 89g of sugars in the pomegranate plunge...Run and find your insulin.  If you are looking for a healthy cafe...keep looking and pass the Tropical Smoothie Cafe by.  The only reason this cafe would get one star is that the staff is nice and the place is clean."}
{"text":"Came here at 1am and this is the best smoothie I've ever had! James was the worker who's working and I was blown away by his smoothie making skills and customer service. Hope to have the same experience next time."}
{"text":"The absolute worst customer service and lazy staff I've ever seen at a food establishment.  Employees taking their time singing songs that are on the radio. There are children while playing unnecessary rap music with girls moaning and all that. Which I'm not opposed to that music but there's a place and time. Eric with the dreads seems like he just doesn't care about anything but getting off whenever his shift ends. Ellie took our order which I guess never made it to Eric to be made. This place is a joke and the only reason why I'm giving this rant is because I work near by and used to come here during breaks but this happens all the time never has been different. This place is an absolute no go. The owners need NEW motivated employees. I ended up leaving with no drink because they never made it after 30 minutes."}
{"text":"I was here twice within these last two weeks. Let me start by saying that I am a huge Tropical Smoothie fan. Also, this is my first time ever leaving a negative review on something. I will try to be unbiased and fair in this review as I know many people would appreciate seeing a negative review that isn't emotional and angry. 
These last two times I came here, I was serviced by two different people. Didn't get their names. One was a blonde male, the first time. The second time was a brunette female with light eyes. 
My first time, the male, I came up to the register to place my order. He was in the back by himself preparing other orders for people. And nobody was upfront to take my order. Red Rock Casino is an incredibly busy establishment, and having one employee doing all of the orders and cashiering is a huge fault all on its own. I couldn't be mad at him for that, even though I had to wait for 5 minutes. What I can blame him for is: 
A) Not acknowledging me standing there for 5 minutes. Although in the back, he can clearly see who is at the register. 
B) Not saying anything to me, such as \"I'll be with you in just a moment\". He said nothing, didn't look at me, and even acted like I wasn't there. I felt invisible and wondered if I was going to even be able to place an order with him. 

5 minutes later, he comes to the front and doesn't say anything. He just looks at me, and I placed my order. He asked for my name and said it would be out shortly.
That was my first interaction.

Second interaction, this time being the female, it was in the morning on Sunday, June 10th.  I remembered what day this was specifically. I was there with a friend, and I saw the girl getting ready to open for the day and asked her what time they open. She gave me a blank, unfriendly face and told me the time. (It was either 8am or 9am, I just remember being there pretty early). So, I let the establishment open before I place an order. I went up to her register and I got that same blank, unfriendly stare. Didn't even ask what she could get me. Just stared and waited for me to say what I wanted. So, I place my order; she's silent the entire time. At this point I am wondering if her behavior would change if I gave her a small tip. I usually try to tip people who give me bad service and see if their behavior changes. I gave her a $7 tip and she did that blank/mean stare, said nothing and threw it in her tip charge and walked off. I couldn't believe it. In all the times that I have ever gave someone a tip who was giving me bad service, their behavior changed immediately. Not her though. She was the first person who gave me bad service, who did not even bat an eye at the fact that I tipped her. I also asked for a banana as the side to my sandwich. 
When I got my sandwich, (and mind you this AFTER tipping her!) she did not even include my banana. 
This location needs some work, and some better scheduling of employees. And maybe even some new employees!"}
{"text":"I drove here after craving a wrap and smoothie after yelp showed me an address and location. I got my hopes up and drove there and it was empty empty empty. Not a soul in sight.  There's nothing inside as in, its closed. The phone number doesn't work, there's literally nothing side beside cement and a\" for lease \"sign.  Can someone tell me if there USED to be one there?"}
{"text":"The nerds that work there are probably HS drop outs with no skill whatsoever. I ordered a smoothie and asked if they had a military discount. He replied \"uhhh ya I think we do, oh yeah we do\" he takes my card and military ID from me... which is weird, never really seen anyone actually take it, they'll just look at it.... I did not get a receipt.... he handed me my smoothie. And I asked if I could get a receipt... his reply..: \"uhh I don't think I can do that\" his coworker then came over and printed it, he seemed like he was struggling too... you can probably guess what happened next.... No military discount was given. What a joke and these dumbass kids need to go."}
{"text":"Needed a quick healthy lunch and decided on a smoothly. Found Tropical Smoothie to be just what I needed.  Friendly service thanks to Kasey. Clean restaurant. Fast lunch in my hand on and my way.  I'm downloading their ap now since it's close to office.  I'll be back!! I love finding new gems like this!"}
{"text":"So apparently they are advertising these new bowls they have. But the problem is you can't have them, because they ran out of all the ingredients. Also if you would like there new beet smoothie forget that too, cause they don't have any beets. What a joke."}
{"text":"I love tropical smoothie this location is nice. I have never gone in but I've been through the drive through a few times. The line moves quick. The staff seems young, there's been a few instances where the card machine wasn't working but luckily I've had cash. Wish their happy hour was more like 2-5 instead of 5-7. Overall nice location and tropical smoothie is the best"}
{"text":"I ordered a bunch smoothies and they were wonderful. The girl behind the counter was amazing I believe her name was Tiffany. Thank you for your wonderful customer service. Great job!!!"}
{"text":"Smoothies are not currenely being made because one employee has to do both make the smoothies and run the register. The other employee is making food. At least 10 people are waiting for their food/ smoothies. These employees are working very hard trying to keep up. Poor management decision for understaffing during lunch."}
{"text":"The slowest tropical smoothie ever. Drive through is a MINIMUM of 15 minutes even if there is only one car ahead of you. Terrible terrible terrible. But the staff is friendly and the product is fine."}
{"text":"This is my go to place when I need a pick-me-up or a lighter lunch. My go-to smoothie is the health nut, and my favorite is the Thai chicken wrap. Always consistent, always friendly, and while the lunch time crowd is a bit of a wait (10/15 minutes), its worth it to me."}
{"text":"Update: they are so much better now!  They've got an (almost) totally different crew in there and everything runs so much smoother now, like clockwork. I've updated from 1 star to 4. 

We keep giving this place chance and chance again because it's a good location for us and their smoothies are DELICIOUS; however it's obvious that soon they'll be going out of business, probably because of bad management. Every single day it's something different: they're out of protein, machines are down, they can only take cash, nothing's prepped, they can't make sandwiches, can't do an online order, the line is long...etc, etc. It's obvious whoever's in charge is either super incompetent or just doesn't care. Avoid frustration and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is the second Tropical Smoothie Cafe I have tried, after one in Chandler.  Since I tried it for the first time, I have had a craving for it again.  I don't remember what the sauce that they put on their ultimate club sandwich is... still don't, to be honest... but it was addictive!  I had to get it again.

This time, I had the same sandwich, along with the sunrise, sunset smoothie.  Both were exactly what I was looking for.  The smoothie was fruity and flavorful.  Apparently it's low calorie too, which is an added bonus.  The sandwich was full of flavor!  Tasty bacon, fresh veggies, good bread, and that sauce... no idea what is in it but I will go back for it again and again.

The down sides: it feels a bit too contrived and corporate for me; and the sandwiches seemed a bit on the small side for the price (the $6-7 range).  Overall though, a great experience."}
{"text":"The staff have the most unfriendly attitude. The menu is apparently not updated because they discontinued the kids meal. I asked them why they don't honor it and was completely ignored. Worst experience I've had at this location. Hoping my review will get to corporate so they can make necessary menu changes and staff training"}
{"text":"Worst Tropical Smoothie ever. They always have the open sign on, but has been closed during business hours for months now. I've been late from work before thinking they were open and wasting my time to drove there."}
{"text":"As an LVAC (Las Vegas Athletic Club) member, I like to come here after the gym or if I'm in the area. They give discounts if you're an LVAC member, have punch cards, & even have a happy hour. (Buy 2 get 1 smoothie free) Tropical Smoothie does deals that get sent to you via text message as well. They have fresh tasting smoothies with a considerate portion! I even wish they had a small size. For healthy options, you can soy/whey protein and even splenda instead of sugar. I recommend the Mango Magic & their sandwiches! Their food menu's really good as well. It makes a lovely snack anytime or after a workout. This location's 24 hours!"}
{"text":"Whoever is a male that works here on Sunday nights should be taken care of for his extreme poor customer service & attitude. Customer service can change your experience no matter how amazing your smoothie or food is. Keep your day job. You don't deserve to spread anymore negative vibes."}
{"text":"Places like this suck you in with large coupon pamphlets I tell ya! Got a BOGO voucher and thought ide try it, since I am always at the Colonnade across the street. Very unimpressed. First off, the place is super small.  We ordered the Cali Chicken Flatbread. Looked good on the menu. It literally took 20 minutes to have the food brought out to us. There were people waiting prior to us walking in, for just smoothies, and even those took forever. The food was just blah. Not bad, but not that great either. And after waiting 20 minutes you would have expected them to have lined it in gold or something! If this place is trying to cater to people on their lunch hour (or half hour lunch), ya'll need to step it up a bit. Who can wait that long, and then still have to allow for actual eating time? I dunno. The girls working (only 2 on staff that I saw), seemed awfully young and probably didn't care about the jumbo line waiting for their stuff. Just not impressed, would not be back.....and glad that I didn't pay full price for just an okay lunch."}
{"text":"Everytime I come into this location, which is a lot, I get an attitude from the girl with glasses. & today, I ordered a beach bum w/ white chocolate & when I got my smoothie it didn't taste like what I ordered. My friend also ordered a beach bum w/ white chocolate & it tasted much different than hers. I asked for them to remake it & Janice took it & said she would make me another one. A couple minutes later, I get another smoothie from the girl w/ glasses & she just pushed it on the counter. I tasted the smoothie & it was exactly like the one I ordered before. I was annoyed & just left with my wrong smoothie."}
{"text":"Here currently, ordered 7 minutes ago still waiting. There is one person working and 11 people waiting for their drinks. Finally got my drink and it tastes wrong- like an ingredient missing. It's not this kids fault but when you are that busy by yourself how can you do good?! Ridiculous that they are scheduling one person and it is busy! I would like management to contact me."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE first (and last) experience.  I'm new to the area and got coupons for here so I figured I would try it out.  My bf and I were the only people in there on a Saturday night (first bad sign).  I ordered the Asian wrap and my bf got the highly promoted/advertised Jerk Chicken wrap and we shared a strawberry/kiwi smoothie.

The floor in the kitchen was a mess, I don't know why since there were NO customers in the whole restaurant.  The kid that took our order was super nice, repeated it back, rang us up, and then he made both our wraps while the only other worker made our smoothie.  Smoothie was great!  As I ate my wrap, it seemed to only have like 3 ingredients in it, chicken, lettuce, and carrots.  I checked their menu online for a description of what I ordered and sure enough they forgot the onion, cilantro, sesame seeds, and wontons! That's over half the ingredients he didn't put in it!  I checked my bf also and his was missing the asparagus but he didn't mind.  I went up to the counter and ask the girl what was supposed to be in mine and she had to go look on the computer for the ingredients!  LEARN YOUR MENU PEOPLE! what bad customer service.  She remade the wrap and it was actually pretty good but both of them were small in my opinion, they didn't fill either one of us up.

The store manager did come over and ask us what happened and I told her.  She then went on to tell me that the ingredients weren't prepped that's why they didn't make it into my wrap.  SERIOUSLY?! You're going to tell your customer that since you didn't have enough prep ready that you just aren't going to put them in the food?  She offered to take my info and keep it on file in the store for a free meal next time but I declined.  I wont be coming back here even for free...too many other good restaurants with great customer service that know their menu for me to waste my time going here again."}
{"text":"Went in this morning with a catering order and Travis killed it. Remembered all the small details and helped me out a lot with suggestions. Super knowledgeable employee!"}
{"text":"STAY AWAY! This particular location is absolutely DISGUSTING. No customer service. The staff do not care about anything. It is literally a joke.  Every time I've went there I had to wait forever until someone came up to the register. THEN I stood there and watched the staff texting and taking his time before getting my smoothie started. Long story short I waited for a smoothie for my entire lunch break and was extremely disappointed. No apron, gloves, hand washing, nothing!  Employees HATE their jobs and make it real obvious. Stay away at all costs. Go to Jamba Juice down the street or Starbucks."}
{"text":"Awesome! I haven't had a good smoothie since leaving Virginia (Tropical Smoothie in Newport News). This location stands up to the brand quality and the service is always awesome.

My usual is sunrise sunset (no mango) and a Thai chicken wrap. My husband is the tropicolada w/ energy boost. 

If you're looking to grab a cool, refreshing lunch this is the place."}
{"text":"Clean looking spot. Great customer service but the smoothies are lacking a bit. Was impressed by the size of my drink - 18 oz drink for about $6. Pretty good deal until I tried it. Not enough of the ingredients in it so it was somewhat flavorless. :/"}
{"text":"The employees at this location are horrible, on 3 different occasions I have walked into an empty store and stood there waiting for them to stop talking and do something and everytime I end up leaving because it is so irritating."}
{"text":"Worst experience EVER! I live right across the street and have been here multiple times. There's always new people working and today I can't even get a wrap because ANOTHER new girl working and she can't cook. Wtf seriously worst location do not go to this location"}
{"text":"I went to this location on Friday evening as a plan B.  I was very impressed with the smoothies.  I had the Watermelon.  Hope to see you soon"}
{"text":"The service at this location is terrible. I walked in and stood there for about 10 minutes before anyone even came out front to help me. I would recommend going to a different location!"}
{"text":"This #SHB walked out of the back, after 10-15 seconds, and then doesn't wash her hands in view of the customer, and then touches that cash register, then DOESN'T was her hands, THEN MAKES OUR SMOOTHIE.  Also dirty restaurant, lights burnt out, roof falling in.  Now lets think about this for a second, if she was touching her phone which Im sure she was, WHO KNOWS WHAT UNSANITIZED GERMS EXIST ON HER PHONE UNDER HER NAILS ON HER FINGER TIPS, AND CASH REGISTER AND EVERYONE WHO HAS EVER TOUCHED IT.   https://www.youtube.com/edit?o=U&video_id=qNWpmZcZ5W4  Also sure gin and juice is not an acceptable song that should be being playing, especially in an environment where there are potentially children around."}
{"text":"Just l waiting 10 minutes ( made 2 smoothies and 2 sandwiches) to order and find out there is now chicken. I drive to the lv bd location and they are out of chicken. 

I guess the positive I was in n out at the lv Blvd location. 

No my spot anymore"}
{"text":"The staff has been great! Always friendly and is always willing to recommend choices!! Their new items on the menu like the super grain bowls are very delicious"}
{"text":"I always avoided this place due to the reviews. Then one day I was extremely ill and could only have liquids. My wife picked me up a smoothie, and I was hooked! Their smoothies are delicious. Yes, they lack is customer service. Not rude, but young, timid, and no management. However, just get your damn smoothie and leave! It's a smoothie place, not Ruth's Chris."}
{"text":"Employees were nice.  The place smells HORRIBLE!!!  It's s hood thing I only wanted a smoothie. I could never eat here!!!  Omg!!!  The windows are filthy, and I mean disguising!!  It looks like they cleaned the inside of the windows, the display cooler and everything else with the filthy rag.  Definitely not up to Summerlin standards."}
{"text":"Good smoothie but most likely won't come back here. They don't hire enough staff the 3rd time now that I've been here I've had to wait a really long time for a smoothie. Looked like everyone around me was upset and waiting for a long time as well.  

Suggestion: hire more staff, lose less customers."}
{"text":"Always quick and easy. Though its busy.. There is a bakery next door to keep you occupied while waiting when extremely busy."}
{"text":"the comments that everyone has posted are still true. in drive thru writing this review, and i must say, terrible service. long wait time, and i had to repeat my order after i told them thru the mic. nothing but kids work here so you get what you expect, which is shitty service! happy trails"}
{"text":"Kinda pricey for what you get. Feels like everything is upcharged to make the smoothie what you want it to be. Good, though. Plan on this being more or less a meal replacement so that you don't confuse yourself as to why you spent this much money on a drink."}
{"text":"Sunny day smoothie was made perfectly. I ordered a king Caesar wrap and it was pretty good. I love that The drive thru is open 24/7! How awesome is that and it's so close to my home. I didn't know this location was here until a few weeks ago when I picked up some hungry Howies pizza."}
{"text":"Second time here and once again, there's only 1 employee working. There's a drive-thru which is convenient, but not when there's a 20 minute wait to place an order! Management seriously needs to consider their employees' welfare. Poor girl is great, but can't take a break."}
{"text":"Kierra was very happy and helpful as soon as I walked in. I felt like I was talking to a friend not an employee. I hope to see her again. 
Now as for the smoothie she recommended her personal favorite of course and my husband and I loved it! We also got the buffalo chicken wrap and destroyed it. She made it very well. And although I have been here before her and the other kind gentleman made this a very good experience (not that last time wasn't) I do not live in the same city but if I'm near I will stop by. 
And the military discount is a big plus! Walked out with a wrap, chips, and a smoothie for less than $10, all with good quality ingredients"}
{"text":"I struggled with the three stars since the food and the smoothie I ordered along with my service was actually quite good but the service was a bit hit or miss for everyone else there.  Actually, the lady who took my order was great and deserves 4 stars.  She answered all my questions about the smoothie and got it out to me as quick as she could.  The food was a little slow for a counter service place but it was good and still warm when I got it home and it looked like there was only one guy back there.

Unfortunately the other lady there was super slow and didn't start the smoothies of the people who ordered ahead of me when they ordered so they actually got theirs after mine and after their food.  The server who helped me had to get the smoothies started when the people asked about them while the other one just stood there.  I don't know if she had any problems or was just incompetent but she was more of a hindrance behind the counter then a help.  

I probably will stop by there again for a smoothie but it will be when I am not in hurry to get anywhere else just to be on the safe side."}
{"text":"This is the second tropical smoothie I've been to. This location was much larger and cleaner than the last. Food was also much better. All American breakfast wrap was so yummy. Smoothies are huge. Seating inside and a table outside. Drive thru at this location as well. In a strip mall. Wrap and smoothie less than $10."}
{"text":"I went there to check out there Mediterranean bowl.  As soon as I walked in, the place had people in there that had already ordered.  Every table had someone sitting at it.  So I go to the counter, they guy didn't even say hi or can I help you!  What ever.  I had a coupon for $4.99 for the Mediterranean bowl.  So I sat down.  It seemed like it took them along time to make smoothies.  Seems like that was all the other people ordered.  I was going to eat it there, but I decided not to, it was freezing in there.  As I'm looking around, I see this sign on the door!  Military 50% So I didn't need that coupon, and that bowl would have cost me $3.50. they have a 1/2 salad or wrap or sandwich, with a smoothie for $7.49.....Ummmmm, I think this is going to be my new spot!
So finally I got my bowl, and as soon as I got in my car, I just wanted a taste!  but a taste lead to me almost eating about 1/2 of this amazing bowl.  And it's a big serving!  I will be back, with my military ID! I don't know anywhere else to get a lunch for less than $4.00."}
{"text":"Nice and clean place. Good fast service. Fun, tropical decor. Can't complain. 
Always good on dairy-free requests and recommendations if ask for any, so far haven't had a bad smoothie here. 
Best perk of all is that the place is open 24h and down the street from me! No more junk food in the middle of the night, now it can be a smoothie! :)"}
{"text":"The food is awesome. I always get the Jamaican Jerk Chicken wrap (light jerk sauce because it too hot for me) plus a Health Nut Smoothie with no sweetener and Whey protein. Order this exactly and you will not be disappointed. 

It would get 5 stars but the location at the San Tan Mall can be slow because of not enough staff.  I've had to wait up to 10 mins before to order. That's not super long but there was no one else in line...just me."}
{"text":"I used to come here a few months ago and they had THE BEST service! That's why I tried giving them the benefit of a doubt these last couple times I have been in.. Nobody greeted me when I walked in, I waited at the register for someone to take my order for like seriously 5-10 minutes- and not one person even acknowledged me. 

Today I was waiting for someone to take my order when one of the girls was just getting to work. Instead of asking me if anyone had helped me yet, she just put her bag away and put her apron on without saying a word to me. The staff seems unfriendly and unwelcoming, which made me extremely uncomfortable. 

I'm not sure if they changed owners or if they just stopped caring about customer service, but I definitely won't be returning because of the bad service! So sad, it used to be a great place to go"}
{"text":"The owners of this location should be ashamed of themselves. Their is no support for the staff. I'm currently sitting inside at one of their tables and their is only one woman here. The seating area is full because their is a steady rush of customers coming in every few minutes. There should be at least 2 people staffed. The woman who took my order was pleasant and friendly and is definitely busting her butt to get these orders fulfilled."}
{"text":"Worst wait time and customer service of any tropical smoothie in town!! I visit regularly for convenience and the experience has consistently gotten worse. Today's visit-- First they could not take care of customers in drive-through, then I was told that they were unsure if they had ingredients for the smoothie that I requested and finally I waited a solid 40 minutes in the lobby after paying before receiving my drink. I was not offered anything to compensate for the wait or inconvenience and was sent away without so much as an apology or have a nice day. The smoothie tastes okay, which is the least I can say for the horrible experience that I   just had."}
{"text":"There is no AC in the store and it's 110 degrees outside. The employees can't manage to figure out how to make both smoothies and food at the same time, even though there's three of them. There is no sense of urgency and the wait is over 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Waited 30 minutes for a smoothie. The staff looked overwhelmed and under trained. They had 8 people waiting for drinks and 7 people waiting to order, yet one of the employees thought it was the time to take out the trash. Very poorly run location."}
{"text":"So... the food here, not too shabby... not great, but not terrible either. But want to know what is terrible? The damn drive thru! How am I the only car here & yet I'm still waiting 20 + minutes for a half ass flatbread sandwich & a bottled coke. Yes. Bottled. Zero effort involved. Convicts on death row have a shorter waiting time than this. Also, be sure to ask for chips if you order a meal. It comes with them. But you dont ever get them without asking. Theres a damn potato chip conspiracy happening, i know it. In conclusion, if youre hungry, try this place out. But if youre starving, youll probably die waiting in the drive-thru for some chips you will never receive."}
{"text":"I went here today. I am very disappointed in the quality of food. I order 2 of the fish tacos. They could only make one so I got a half order Thai chicken salad without the chicken. They were polite about it and did the exchange. Both the taco and salad say romaine lettuce and mixed greens. I make 4-6 salads every week. Do not be fooled by this. The lettuce is the quality of iceberg lettuce. Totally deceiving with about 4 big pieces of Spring Mix on top with a shredded iceberg underneath. I was disappointed and couldn't bother finishing it. 

After I took out most of the lettuce from the taco it wasn't bad. I highly recommend to just stick with smoothies or check your order before leaving.

Smoothies are awesome. I recommend one of the new Green Smoothies. Very delicious.

Customer Service: Great
Food Quality: Poor
Drink Quality: Good"}
{"text":"I will only order the Pomegranite Plunge here. I am very picky with smoothies since I hate yogurt in them. I am very disappointed in ALL Tropical Smoothies since they got rid of almost all their veggie options. I use to love the veggie flat bread. I do not recommend going here if you are a vegetarian. The salad at most is usually soggy and not fresh. They put dressing on thing when you get it to go even when you ask them NOT TO. For a fast good smoothie...go here! But for a meal...pick another place. 

This is my opinion on ALL Tropical Smoothies."}
{"text":"Worker at this location says no military discount unless in uniform. The Tropical Smoothie on Blue Diamond is much better.  10% off with military identification.  50% off if in uniform."}
{"text":"Usually stop by early mornings before work, if I'm running late I love that I can call and place my order on my way there, service is always great, very convenient. Tried most of the smoothies but the acai berry and sunny day are my favorite!"}
{"text":"Stopped for flip flop day. Line was long but was in and out in 6 minutes! Quick and friendly service like always. Full staff, great food."}
{"text":"Going here is such a waste of time. I can't tell you how many times I've sat for 10 minutes in the drive-thru waiting to be acknowledged, and just get aggravated and leave because no one said a word. Then when you go inside, there's usually only one person working, and you're lucky if they even greet you. The only reason I give it two stars is because I kind feel bad for the kids working in there all by themselves trying to take on drive thru orders and inside orders. Get it together management!"}
{"text":"This place is an embarrassment to Tropical smoothie. 
As we walk up to this location, on a Sunday morning, when you think they would be pretty busy... it didn't look like they were open. The lights were off inside and the open sign wasn't turned on. No idea if they were open because no one was inside.. we tried to open the door and a girl comes out from the back. 
She took our order, not very friendly, and we sat to wait. 
But where to sit? All of the tables, literally, ALL the tables were dirty. The floors were smothered in dirt with trash under every table. No napkins to be found in sight, so I took it upon myself to go to the restroom to get a wet paper towel to wipe off our table. 
Walk into the women's restroom, and it was absolutely disgusting. Toilets were gross, trash on the floor, smelled bad, no soap and no paper towels. 
Beyond irritated at this point, we took our food and left. 
Hopefully we don't get sick from what we ate as I can only imagine what their kitchen looks like behind the counter. 
I will never return to this location and feel pity for this stores owner."}
{"text":"Tickets to the struggle bus have gone ON SALE lately. Not sure what's up at this store, but they're always failing. Online ordering is late, only one person ever working. I never want to wait in the drive through because you'll never be done in 30 minutes. And by the time you've had enough of the wait and would drive somewhere else you're stuck in the drive through. So I go in, and it's still easily a 15 min wait. They need to restaff this location. At least get more people working, who have an ability be to be sensitive and communicative that people have had to wait a very long time."}
{"text":"Usually a pretty decent service oriented crew. I don't understand how there are more than three people behind the counter, one standing around, and no one can seem
to answer the phone."}
{"text":"Food and smoothies are great, but I come on Saturdays and there is always one person working with a huge line. Takes 15 minutes just to get a smoothie. Saturday's are pretty busy I'd assume, so you think they'd have an extra help.

EDIT: I've been back a few times and the staffing on Saturdays has increased! Excellent work"}
{"text":"After getting our Zumba on, I wanted a smoothie to cool down, so using the trusty Yelp App,
we found this location.

We were even more thrilled to see a 24 HOUR DRIVE THRU!!!! We also had good service despite many other reviews mentioning not-so-good service.

My Hawaiian Breeze sure did hit the spot, and 10% off from showing your LVAC membership card is an added bonus!....ALOHA!!!

After getting a can of whoop-a$$ from Patricia's Kettlebell class down the road at LVAC, this has been our spot to fuel up.

Their smoothies hit the spot, and I don't have a particular favorite just yet...I'd rather go down their menu and try different ones until I find \"the one\". Another great option is their $6.99 deal of your choice of smoothie with either a small salad or half a sandwich.

We are both fans of their Turkey and Dried Cranberry sandwich, so that deal works perfectly for us! Fast, cheap healthy, and delicious! What's not to love!?!? ALOHA!

{"text":"Food was same quality as other trop locations.  The service is far below other locations though.  I would not suggest online orders because you may not want to wait for the extended period that it takes to get a smoothie (well after the posted pick up time)."}
{"text":"Worst staff of any establishment I have been to, on 4 separate occasions of coming here no one is at the front to greet you, someone could literally empty the register 100 times before someone kid who could give a shit about the place comes up and makes your order as slow as possible. Today I just waked out I waited 5 full minutes for someone to come to the front, they didn't as we pulled away in our car she came out from the back drinking a Fing drink! R u kidding me I literally went into red rock to get my food because I had to leave. Literally the worst. Last time I even try there. Give anyone else your business, there is nothing worse then paying for something and feel disrespected. Or go and just help yourself, no one will stop you, simply because they don't care."}
{"text":"\"FYI, when you cut a 'TO-GO' wrap in half that has any kind of sauce, guess what happens, yeah the sauce leaks out all over and the tortilla and it falls apart!\""}

{"text":"I love Tropical Smoothie. When I first ate there, it was perfect and delicious. But as I continued to order there, my wraps were made more poorly each time. I still eat there because it is just so good and healthy, but I wish it was made with more care.."}
{"text":"Dropping the review down to one star. Waited behind two people for about five minutes before we even ordered. First thing we asked was if they actually had apple and kale slaw. They said yes, so we ordered our two wraps. The wraps took about 10 minutes to make, and then there was no slaw in the bag. We asked them for the slaw and the girl at the window said \"oh yeah!\".  A couple of minutes later she came back and told us we'd have to wait another five minutes because they didn't have any slaw already prepared. Okay fine, we'll wait since we asked before we even ordered if they had slaw. Then, amazingly, she comes back a few minutes later to tell us they don't have the dressing to make the slaw, so we'd only be getting apple and kale. We just asked for our money back. We spent 25 minutes there and didn't even leave with what we ordered. How they stay in business I'll never know."}
{"text":"I didn't want to be late to work, so I tried calling this place to place an order so it could be ready by the time I got there... The first time I called they answered and hung up right away. Then I called about 10 more times and they did not answer the phone. this place has horrible customer service ! every time I have gone there, they take about 10-15 minutes just to make me one smoothie and half the time they would chill for about five minutes in the back before actually coming out to make it !unfortunately this is the only one that's closest to me but it is really annoying and inconvenient..."}
{"text":"Just left there. My sandwich was freezing cold and it was supposed to be a hot one. I brought this up to the girl before i left the drive through and her response was \" it's pre timed. I can't fo anything about it\". Talk about letting your business get run into the ground by a bunch of lazy teens agers."}

I like this place because it offers an alternative to typical smoothie places (or to typical carry out period!). Their menu opts include a decent variety of salads, sandwiches, wraps and smoothies.

I had the coconut lime chicken salad and half of a coconut curry wrap. The contents were very fresh. 

Staff was super sweet and efficient, always a plus. We informed the young lady of some issues and she immediately handled them. As I was leaving one of the ladies saw me carrying my salad container in my hand and offered a bag as I headed out he door. The key is that they seemed genuinely nice and not phony nice just b/c thy work there. That is truly a rarity. I certainly hope to return soon :-)"}
{"text":"Use to come here every day for a smoothie or a wrap, but since they hired this new girl (Tiffany?) it's awful.  She is horrible-can't get orders right, has her hair in front of her face, and they have her at lunch hour which is the busiest time.  She seriously slows everything down and has given me personally the wrong order three times.  I asked for a Jamaican jerk chicken wrap and got a buffalo chicken wrap, she gave me the wrong smoothie twice.  

She mentioned once that it was slow...this place use to be packed and busy until she came!  Plus, it seems that they have understaffed at busy lunch hours too. 

They need to fire this chick and staff accordingly.  Place has really gone downhill."}
{"text":"Wow. I've been in line for 10 minutes and still have two cars ahead of me. I would have left without my already ordered smoothies, but I'm sandwiched in with more dissatisfied customers behind me. Terrible business model, no smoothie is worth the wait or carbon footprint. Clearly they don't have the secret shopper from my drive thru days. Yikes. I work down the street but will never return.

To edit: they just got my order wrong! Two smoothies straight from the menu."}
{"text":"I usually order the detox island green. It was not good. On top of that the price list has 2 different prices for it. It's listed as $4.99 and $5.99.  So they said they have to charge the higher price. Not going here again."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible horrible ! Just read all the other reviews, they've already stated everything I wanted to say . Do not waste your time at this place!!!"}
{"text":"Loveeeee tropical smoothie! All of their drinks are so good! I love the Bahama Mamma and Blimey Limey. But when I feel like being a fatty I get the Peanut Paradise! So good!"}
{"text":"The people working were great however this large black woman who seemed to be the manager was awe full.. Rap music blaring in the place and a huge line.. She was on the phone the whole time as I waited 30 min for my Tai Chicken Wrap."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and didn't really think anything of it until I got a smoothie. Their smoothies are excellent, I came back the next day! They have an affordable price and have way more then just smoothies! I ordered a breakfast wrap and my mom ordered a sandwich and both were way better than anything we have ever had before! I recommend this place if you are ever in AZ! Love love love!"}
{"text":"What the hell guys. What the actual hell... 18 minutes in drive thru and for now the 4th time in a row out of KEY ingredients. How are you out of spinach, kale, and bananas. Last time you were out of chicken. I don't understand how you stay open. I worked at tropical smoothie for 2 years and I'm proud to say I never had to say we were out of anything (besides the one time avocado was recalled). The management here must be the same as the Craig and Commerce location. No customer service skills, atrocious wait times for simple foods, people out of uniform every time I come (one of the girls today has hair ALL OVER the place that looks very very unprofessional. You need leadership brought in and you need to be accountable for your employees and your inventory. There is NO WAY this is up to corporate standards. The one star goes to the kid who took my order who clearly lacked training on the most basic computer functions. I have no idea why I think it will get better. There are four employees no customers inside and it's now been 26 minutes in the drive thru while they are all in their joking, gossiping and laughing and throwing things at one another. What the hell is this guys whyyy. 

Finally got my order they didn't even toast the sandwich and I'll be reblending my smoothie at home"}
{"text":"Where to begin... as a former employee of this location, I am personally ashamed of what it's become. I have been several times, maybe 5-10 times, in the last 2 years, and it just continues to downgrade. 
From under-blended smoothies (more than once) to staff not even wearing a uniform. It's just become a joke. Tonight I decided to stop by to grab a quick bite, and what a raging disappointment! I ordered a flat bread only to be told \"uhh hold on we are almost out of everything for food.\" Poor inventory or laziness on the part of prep? I'm not sure, but both are unacceptable. Kris ran a VERY tight ship and to see it be so poorly managed at this time is upsetting to say the least. The kid who was behind the drive through window was in a camo shirt and jeans and the other girl there was in a SUPER DIRTY TSC shirt and was just standing there on her phone. It was sort of close to close so I can understand standing around, IF ALL THE SIDE AND CLOSING WORK WAS DONE which even from the drive thru window was obviously not, given the stacked dishes at the end of the smoothie line. Who is watching the tapes? Who is managing? Who bmp is in charge, because it starts at the top...
If this place isn't cleaned up and back to shipshape soon it won't last. 
(Like the last time I was dined in and no one came out to greet the fomront of the house for easily 5 minutes and there were people waiting there before me 2 of which left in a rage) 
Tropical Smoothie is a chain, franchise or not, there are standards, rules, and a name to uphold.(two stars since the food, which was an impromptu mash up of menu items since they were out of so much, was hot and the kid was at least nice.)"}
{"text":"Hands down the worst Tropical Smoothie Cafe I've ever been to. I am extremely disappointed that this is the one closest to my new house. The first time, my smoothie was chunky. I was literally chewing this thing. The second time, they gave me a cup with a hole in it. The third time doesn't exist and it never will. This is what happens when a store is ran by children."}
{"text":"Love the smoothies, never enough workers. 2 worker,  line all the time. Customer service is awful! Why do they do this. Maybe I should just stop coming smoothies are delicous but never worth the wait. Get your act together you have walk out, pissed  off customers all the time. Get a 3rd person worth the minimum wage"}
{"text":"This is the worst location in Vegas . Really disappointing since it's the only one on my way to work.  Every time it's a issue.  No regular size cups, so I get 2 kids cups (yeah the amount not the same) . Don't have this ingredient, don't have that don't have this.  Then they are never fully blended.  Chunks of ice clog the straw . Management needs to step up.  Supplies and training.   Come one this is simple. Hard to screw up smoothies .  But hey at least you get that right ."}
{"text":"First get the employees trained.  I ordered a peanut butter crunch flat bread and a blimey Limey .  Normally there is a special where you get $1.99 for the smoothie with the wrap purchase.  So I get my total and it seems low so I sign and give a tip.   Then when I get my receipt I'm only charged for the wrap.  great!  Go back to counter ask about my smoothie guy says sorry he forgot. Then can't get me the smoothie for 1.99 . So I pay full price for both and  to top it off it's the longest wait for my smoothie.  I almost just asked for a full refund and left.    Definitely need to get this corrected.  Good thing there are other places to go. I'll be avoiding this one !"}
{"text":"SLOW service. I sat there in the drive through the other day for 10 minutes, even called and no answer, finally gave up drove and saw all the employees out front hanging out"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars I would! This place is a complete joke. We ordered 5 smoothies and 4 wraps and they told us they were out of chicken, so we left. Went back a week later to order 3-smoothies and we were told they were out of sugar?!?!? Seriously this is the worst smoothie place in town. Do not waste your time going here."}
{"text":"This location has gone way down hill... :( It just took 45min to get a Smoothie and 1/2 salad. There were only two employees working and tons of unhappy customers. The girl at the counter was moody and sassy. 

I order the new Arise smoothie and it doesn't taste much of anything. Its awful! Once I got back to my office I added a lot of honey to give it some taste but still awful. I also, order the loaded spinach salad which they didn't have the dressing for, so I then switched for the Caesar and it was like an added request with 50 extra demands. 

I am so annoyed now. All i wanted was a fruit smoothie for lunch and now stuck with BLA. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"I just spent half hour in a drive thru line REALLY!!!!!! I couldn't leave because I had a car behind me and in front . They only  have one person working and it's 12:00 pm . I got mango magic smoothie and instead I got ice full of fruit chunks . I had stopped coming to this location for the same reason because every time I would of chunks of fruit or veggies and it just got gross after trying to drink it for a while. I guess they haven't changed and won't be going back !!!!!"}
{"text":"I have an on, off and on again relationship with at home juicing and I really should decide if I'm in it or if it will be something I will always half love. It's quite a chore and an investment of time and more of a clean up than it's worth and I figure I'll probably never do it again once the Juicer I have finally burns out.  So I start thinking, it cost roughly 10 bucks for all my ingredients and about 45 min of my time to produce a glass of my favorite juice blend. Tropical Smoothie has the same exact drink for $4 in and out in a jiffy. NO clean up!!!! The juicer may find its way off my kitchen counter and into my go-to Goodwill box very soon. Plus Tropical Smoothie's version of my Spinach, Kale, Pineapple, Mango and Peach drink taste much much better than mine."}
{"text":"We stopped here to cool off and grab a drink for lunch!  I know they clean with bleach but as soon as you opened the door, you were slapped silly with bleach smell.  The staff that took our order was nice.  We stay there talking for a little.  I don't know if it was the manager or who, but he seems very unprofessional.  Loud and a little obnoxious.  But the smoothies were good."}
{"text":"Ok.  I am hooked on this place.  First I was like WHAT?  Eat at a smoothie place.  They serve FOOD?  The flatbreads looked so good.  I ordered the chicken pesto flatbread.  The flatbread is soft and grilled to be slight crispy at the edges.  And chicken, parmesan cheese, and pesto was super flavorful.  I had to get it again the next week.  he he he...  I got the Hawaiian Breeze smoothie the first time.  SO GOOD.  I had to try other flavors... This time I got the Kiwi Quencher smoothie.  YUM.  Keep in mind the smoothies are lowfat!"}
{"text":"Not vouching for the service and parking is a challenge, but conveniently located in Univ. Circle at Euclid and Mayfield. Join the mobile community for some good deals right to your phone before stopping in."}
{"text":"If you want to feel welcomed don't come to this smoothie place. You are never greeted with a smile, it's cold and uninviting.  The owner is rude and and acts like they're doing the customer a favor.  
Recently I ordered a flat bread, they made it with half the ingredients off, when I complained they never apologized!"}
{"text":"Decent place for a quick lunch near Case.  The half turkey sandwich and peanut butter smoothie was really filling.  I wasn't able to finish the smoothie.  It asked for no sugar to be added and the smoothie was perfect.  It's a healthy place to stop near the hospital and Case.  $7.50 was a good deal for the half sandwich and smoothie."}
{"text":"This review has long been coming! I am hoping to wake up whoever the management is of this location!. Most of my neighbors in the area have stopped visiting this location due to how unclean they run this operation.  There are plenty of other locations available and tonight I am fed up with this place. Here's what I pulled up to tonight!!  And let me tell you! They were out of wayyyyy more stuff than what this teen has written on this paper at the drive thru. 
Management what the freak up!! Why are these kids all working tonight putting this piece of paper on the drive-through of how many things you are out of this is not acceptable. This isn't the first time this location screws up. Don't bother stopping here. They also ate not sanitary in their practices from what my neighbors heard from an ex manager there who recently left"}
{"text":"Wow! Exactly as the comments below
I went into the drive through and was not greeted. I called out \"hello\" twice until someone said \"I'll be right with you\" 
No apology or no hello... Nothing.
So I waited... And waited.... And waited
A good while until I thought it was too long to wait and just left.
Mgmt better get their stuff together because they are losing customers FAST. 

I'm not returning until I start seeing more stars. Lol"}
{"text":"I am not one to go out of my way to be negative, but after 4 attempts in hopes it was unlucky I've given up. I would LOVE if the service was better because I love the food and smoothies here. The shortest amount of time I have spent in the drive-thru is 10 minutes and that was with no cars ahead of me. More recently I went and 3 cars were before me...( I should have known better) 38 minutes later I received my smoothie and ended up being late to work. If you decide to go here don't waste your time in the drive-thru, go inside. Also, do not ever go on your lunch break... you will be late."}
{"text":"So I periodically visit this Tropical Smoothie location.  I enjoy their smoothies and breakfast sandwiches.  I usually get the Sunrise Sunset.....delicious!  The service is usually great but this last time I went maybe the two employees making the  smoothies were having a bad day but they completely forget my order.  So after sitting patiently for about five minutes.  I walked back up to the counter and asked the young lady if my smoothies was finished.  She asked me \"Did you order a smoothie\"?  I reply \"Ummmm yes I did'.  Her response was \"Oh was which one did you order?\"  Now in my mind I was thinking \"what does the ticket say?\" but I respond Sunrise Sunset (delicious).  They must have been busy following Justin Bieber's meltdown on Twitter.......but the 3 people after me got their order?????"}
{"text":"Came in tonight( Friday night ) , we were told no food as ' the oven was broken and the guy was coming to fix it in the morning'. How funny, a few months ago when my boyfriend and I came in we were told the exact same fake story , the late night employees obviously just do not feel like making food, which is ridiculous, they choose to be open late and it was only 11.30.
  No mind, we just ordered our smoothies and left. We tried them after leaving, both were disgusting, watered down no taste crap. Worst smoothie I have had in my life. $14 down the drain, we chucked them as they were Undrinkable . We will never return to this location, terrible"}
{"text":"Ordered here and get like i was hurting the employee by even stepping in the building. Service was not happy to be there"}
{"text":"I ordered an açaí Berry boost and chicken Caesar wrap which came with sun chips. The smoothie is delicious. I haven't eaten my sandwich yet, but I'll update my review once I have!"}
{"text":"Expect a long wait to even be able to order. While waiting I watched an employee make wraps and other food for people. Between five different items she never once changed her gloves. That included also touching the microwave, refrigerator, different ingredients after touching meat, and moving the mop and bucket. I will not be ordering food from here ever. Way too many health and sanitation violations during a 20 minute wait."}
{"text":"HATE  Nothing.

DISLIKE  Some of the younger cashiers who aren't very helpful. The salads and noodle bowls.

LIKE  The Wasabi Caesar Roast Beef sandwich. The Early Bird wrap. Most of the smoothies. The tropical ingredients and supplements.

LOVE  Open 24 hours."}
{"text":"I loveeeee this place, such good food and smoothies. They messed up my order twice in one day though so the third time they said they wrote my name down to get a free drink next time. I have yet to go in!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the most unprofessional group of employees I've ever seen. After placing my order for a sandwich and smoothie,  2 guys and a practically half naked girl walk in and start talking to the guy making smoothies. While laughing and joking he tells the guys he had to clean up the mess they left from the night before (obviously they are employees as well). Then one of the guys starts flirting with a girl working the register and she very loudly tells him to shut the f $#! Up. During all this 2 people get their smoothies before me, who ordered after me and my food was up before my smoothie. Let's just say I'm over this place...."}
{"text":"Not that I've really been to any locations that are better but I would advise everyone to stay away from this location. I stopped in at 5:30pm on a Thursday night to order an Avocolada and a buffalo chicken wrap. There was one younger male working and a lady in front of me in line who ordered 2 avocolada's. After her order, the guy behind the register took my order then began on her smoothies. He made her smoothies then took the two people's orders in line behind me before starting my order which was the exact same smoothie as the previous two he just made for the first customer. He goes in the back to start my wrap and instead yells out to me that all of the tortillas are still frozen. I asked for the smoothie, forget the wrap. He says \"there is someone with a salad ahead of you then I'll start your smoothie.\" I'm sorry, but was I not first in line anyway? He makes both a salad and a smoothie for the lady behind me before even starting mine. He finally handed me a smoothie (which was terrible) and I asked for a refund for the buffalo chicken wrap. I was met with, \"I'm not authorized to do refunds.\" Okay, so now what? I just paid for a wrap you can't make me? I asked if he could make a buffalo chicken salad instead which ended up being nothing more than 3 small strips of chicken on spinach. When he finally handed it to me he noticed I was writing a Yelp review and offered to wipe off the excess smoothie that was spilling over the top when he originally gave it to me. No thank you and no thank you to coming back here."}
{"text":"Chandra seemed unhappy to be at her job, she wasn't smiling, I said hello and how was she and didn't ask back, I get it, people have a bad day. I left her a tip, she didn't say thank you. Oh well. The buffalo chic wrap has a lot of hot sauce but it was still good. I got their new nutritional smoothie, island green, which is really good, perfect balance of sweetness but not over the top. Definitely will have it again. The place was clean as well as the outdoor area. The outside bushes have wasps every time I come here. Not sure if they have a best somewhere close? Over all giving it 3 stars because of friendliness."}
{"text":"My wife and I came in to Tropical Smoothie cafe the other day and were greeted by an extremely friendly employee. Not only did she give us suggestions, she made the greatest smoothie!!!! The shop was clean and we loved the atmosphere!!! Thanks for the experience and delicious smoothies Cassie!!!"}
{"text":"Very slow and understaffed. The employees are unprofessional and dirty looking. Wont go back."}
{"text":"Poor service, very slow. 20 minutes for a wrap and the guy at the cash register was very rude. I complained and he shrugged his shoulders. Owner was there and was only concerned with light bulbs, not customers. This place will last 6 months."}
{"text":"This place is addicting. My favorite is the Bahama mama with B12 and the jerk chicken wrap. Friendly staff, great prices, delicious."}
{"text":"Their smoothies are BOMB. Sooo good. Kind of expensive but definitely worth it bc theyre big in size and delicious."}
{"text":"So I got excited that there was a drive thru, but omg did I end up disappointed. I have been waiting here for 20 minutes, atleast, since placing my order, and I'm still in line. Had U read the reviews I'm seeing now I would not have come here . You guys need new management in this location ASAP!"}
{"text":"My wife and I sometimes drop by here after the gym for a quick MuscleBlaster smoothie.  When we rolled in today about 11:40 am, there were actually three girls at work, with no one in line, so we figured we would be served quickly. 

The young woman at the cash register had the cash drawer out on the counter with her back to us  and was clearly going through the money in the cash drawer one coin at a time. My wife asked whether one of three girls could help us, and one of the other two said yes, but no one moved a finger. We continued to stand at the counter waiting for more than a minute while the young lady with her back to us continued to simply count one coin at a time. Sensing the young woman at the register with her back to us was focused on her cash drawer,  my wife finally stated \"we can use a credit card if it makes it easier to order.\"  The girl turned to look at her, and without a word simply turned back to her drawer and continued counting.

To be perfectly honest, it was one of the rudest experiences, and the poorest example of customer service I've ever experienced. No \"I'll be with you in 60 seconds, nothing.\"  Regardless of what you are doing, when a customer walks in, your attention should be on them, and with three people working, the customer shouldn't just be standing at the counter for three straight minutes with no interaction.  We'll be doing going to the Protein House in Arcadia for our after the gym smoothies from now on, and these guys, who met expectations before today, are now getting a thumbs down from this former customer. Dumbshits!"}
{"text":"Order smoothies w pineapple mango or banana with no sugar. The fruit is sweet enough.
But raspberry blueberries and strawberries need the sugar."}
{"text":"I used to come here on a weekly basis.  Every Friday I would treat myself.  The prices have gone up a bit on what was already an expensive lunch to begin with, but I'd still come in.  My last visit really tested my patience though.  I understand the lunch hour rush gets busy, but I was the first one to put my order in and quite literally the last one to get my full meal. After seeing a bunch of people that came in after I did get their entire meal and leave, I asked the lady in the front to check on my smoothie - to which she confidently replied \"it should be right out\".  When she rushed into the back, I thought maybe she's gone to check on it.  Nope.  She comes back out to the register to help a bunch of other people order.  THEY get their food too!  Finally I go up to ask her again on the status and she says \"I'll take care of it\" and finally starts making my smoothie.  I get that it is overwhelming but seriously, that's some pretty horrible customer service.  If you're gonna spend this kind of money ($13 in Vegas can get you practically into any type of all-you-can-eat lunch buffet) on a decent meal, might as well go where they'll recognize a customer that's been standing around for 20 minutes waiting on their food.  I agree with the other posts, severely understaffed!  Also one star for lack of observation and poor customer service!"}
{"text":"After waiting 10 minutes at the register to order, I was not even acknowledged.  The only worker there also proceeded to take the drive thru order in front of me.  Bad customer service, unfriendly environment, and terribly under staffed."}
{"text":"Always amazing smoothies, I haven't tried their food but it looks awesome. At this particular location, Brandon was my server and he was awesome! It was super busy and he was as sweet and chipper as could be and I really really appreciated it! Usually smoothies take forever and a day to get made and they made mine super quick while they had a full house. Kudos to you guys! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I like be Tropical Smoothie Cafe, but today we all waited over a half hour in the drive through line!! Not sure what was going on. But this is certainly not away to keep repeat customers."}
{"text":"Besides the lack of enthusiasm exhibited by the employees, the service and wait time is awful. There are two people in the back and one cashier, yet the line is extremely long for paying AND waiting. I've been waiting 20 minutes now for a smoothie despite having only 3 people infront of me at the register. It's sad how the work dynamic here isn't efficient."}
{"text":"HIRE MORE EMPLOYEES!!! I would have rated a 4 or maybe even a 5 if the wait wouldn't be so damn long. The food is pretty awesome, but waited 20 minutes for 2 sandwiches and 1 smoothie! 
Avoid coming here if you are in a hurry or only have a short lunch break."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I love the flat bread sandwich's at Tropical Smoothie Cafe, but this location has some serious management/owner issues. 
I stopped by about noon and had to wait 10 minutes for someone to come out of the backroom to take my order. The cashier was friendly once he came out, but there is no way you should have zero staff in the front of house for this long.
The money lost by the number of people walking out, would more then cover the cost of an additional cashier.
To the franchise owner, I would look over your surveillance video to see how many walk outs you have through out the day."}
{"text":"I love the food/smoothies at Tropical Smoothie BUT this location is the worst!! Last year I wrote a complaint to management about how I appreciate that they serve Beyond Meat, but the employees were rude on multiple visits. I was given a free smoothie card and that was fine, but I didn't return because they were rude when I went to redeem my free smoothie. 6+ months go by and a few days ago I decide I'll give it another shot. I ordered a Beyond Meat Thai Wrap and waited forever in the drive thru. I took a bite and realized very quickly (after being completely meat free for 2 years!) that they made it with chicken instead! I went back and kindly asked for a refund and for them to remake the wrap. They made me a buffalo chicken wrap and when I returned that wrap stating it was not the original one I ordered, the employee debated with me that she saw I had a buffalo wrap and that I told her I wanted a buffalo wrap DESPITE having a receipt that said Thai. I wasted 20 minutes for them to get my order wrong 2x and argue with me about it even though I never got an attitude or was rude. I will NEVER go back or recommend this location."}
{"text":"I have been here many times because it is literally right across the street from my college and well, you can't be much closer unless you're living inside the building really. They tend to frown upon that. 

Normally, I have to wait a bit longer because the entire school population swarms to the feeding ground, and usually they are a tad bit slower than I would like. All I want is a freaking smoothie! Today, however, was much different. I barely had time to sit down before I received my smoothie. And it was delightful! I used to only get a Chocolate Chiller because well, chocolate. Recently, I switched to Beach Bum because who doesn't like covered Strawberries and Bananas. 

Today, I took the plunge. I tried their new Acai Berry Boost smoothie and holy crap, it's like the heavens opened up! Seriously. It is the best thing I have ever tasted. Not to mention healthy. I have to watch my delicate figure, you know (HA!). But really, best thing they could have made! New favorite! And if service stays fast, I may be forced to go back more often. You know...forced..."}
{"text":"Smoothies are one size: Big, so the $5.50 price tag is not completely out of line. They have a great selection of flavors and today I asked for an \"older one\" that apparently isn't on the menu any longer but they were glad to make it for me (they even knew what was in it already) and it was done SO FAST! Yay! In the past, I've had to wait quite a while when I've ordered a wrap or salad with my smoothie but this was nice, efficient, friendly (but not too friendly) service.

Overall, the menu items are a notch above fast food, but not too much above...microwaved meats and such; use your imagination...

I appreciate the calories counts online!"}
{"text":"I love their smoothies but the staff is HORRIBLE. They know absolutely nothing about their menu. I have come in several times and asked questions about the smoothies and what's in them/ explain what I want/ ask if they have something similar and they just stare at you blankly. They'll just kinda mumble and give you some irrelevant answer. The workers just seem so out of it. Also they have no phone!! I called so many time about a to go order, and called about possibly getting a refund for a terrible smoothie and they didn't answer. When I came back I asked if they had a phone and the guy answered with \"uhhh I think my manager disconnected the phone line because it was getting expensive\". How unprofessional and ridiculous. After getting a watered down smoothie and being told they have no phone line because it's so pricey I decided I'm never going back."}
{"text":"This location is awesome! Staff is beyond great. They go above and beyond to satisfy you! Deon (might be spelling his name wrong) but Deon was awesome! Thank you"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since Fall 2015 and I thought it was the best Tropical Smoothie cafe in the Vegas area.  Now it's changed.  What happened to the old staff?  They were on point with the orders, expedient, and friendly.  The last few times I've had to wait 15+ minutes for my order.  Yesterday I ordered an all American omelette and a smoothie.   The omelette was heated on the outside but the inside wasn't cooked.  I was still waiting for the smoothie and apparently the staff forgot about it.  It was eventually made but that visit left a very negative impression.  Adding more insult to the injury, I saw the C rating from the health department.  Definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"This place has the WORST customer service. Came in on a Sunday at 1:15 and waited 20 minutes to be served. Waited in drive thru and came inside and started yelling cause no one was answering. Found Jade and Marcus in the back of the store.. we thought something happen to the workers cause we saw a purse up front and the water running. Went to check the bathrooms and the back and there they were talking about they couldn't hear us yelling. Smh! The worst!!"}
{"text":"The smoothies taste really fresh and you get SO MUCH! For such a good price. Definitely possible to be a meal replacement. And if you order a sandwich you can add any smoothie for $3.75! It's amazing!! Check it out UNCC students and people in the University area!"}
{"text":"Expect to be in line at the drive thru for at LEAST 20-30min. I've came here at least 10 times and each time has been an extremely long wait to even order.. even when I'm literally the only one there they take forever and I immediately regret pulling in. The food has always been good although the few times I've specifically asked for sauce on the side they don't- still good food and smoothies. Would come more often but service is way too slow..."}
{"text":"I ordered the strawberry/banana smoothie. One it wasn't even a smoothie it was more like and icee and it tasted like water! No flavor was so ever!!!! Worst \"smoothie\" I have ever had. I do not recommend it!"}
{"text":"Smoothies are always good and you can't go wrong with peanut butter banana crunch but the bathroom was beyond horrible!!!!"}
{"text":"This location is such a mess. It really sucks because this is the best location right by my house and right by the gym and I always like to pick up a smoothie after working out at LVAC. I've only had an issue with the quality of the food once when my smoothie taste like street tapwater and they fixed it no questions asked. But the big problem here is how long they take going through the drive-through expect to be there anywhere between 15 to 30 minutes ordering inside expect wait at least 20 minutes and hear the employees curse and talk crap about the customers in the drive-through. I really wish this location could get it together but it seems like they can't."}
{"text":"This place is seriously the worst  place I've ever been to. It's taken over 10 minutes to get a smoothie. Every time I come here it takes a ridiculous amount of time and the employees don't even care that they are seriously slower than molasses... WHY, when I was the only customer, does it take more than 10 minutes for a smoothie? If you can go somewhere else for your smoothie needs, definitely go elsewhere... unless, you know, you enjoy spending your entire day waiting for just a simple smoothie.


Update... it's been 20 minutes."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and the food is great. The location is decent in the parking is good. I come here quite often but for today May 2 my sandwich was completely wrong and the service was awful. I had to come back and return a sandwich that to tasted awful and the cashier was not that nice and every time I try to explain what issue was he cut me off.
 The sandwich was made correctly chips were given but I was not offered a new smoothie.
I highly recommend that you check your food before you leave even if it appears that it could be correct it may not be so save yourself the frustration."}
{"text":"Food is great. Service is terrible. Last week I went and the cashier acted like it was the biggest inconvenience to be helping me and had the rudest condescending look and tone. I went today hoping it would be better and i ended up waiting 10 min at the counter because all the \"workers\" were in the back doing who knows what. If you are going to hire kids at least hire competent and responsible ones! They always have the worst attitudes I think today was my last stop for a while!"}
{"text":"You are lucky if you get what you want from this location, they are always running out of something, I used to live close to the tropical smoothie on eastern and warm spring, they never had this problem, this location on Stephanie sucks!"}
{"text":"545am and I sat in line for over 20 minutes with 5 cars in front of me.  I think they only had 1 maybe 2 employees working.  I get it, no one wants to work graves in a smoothie joint, but if you have line of cars wrapping around the building... here's your sign you may need to plus up the staffing."}
{"text":"Great experience. I didn't catch the nice girl's name. I messed up on my online order, and when I went in and changed it she was so nice about fixing it for me."}
{"text":"Had come a couple at times they always rushing to order and with attitude.like the product but they need to get better customer service"}
{"text":"Got bored waiting for my order, so I passed the time by writing a Yelp review. This is the second location I've been to, and both are equally terrible. Messy floors, messy kitchen/prep area, and excessively long waits. Many people waiting had to wait for their sandwich, and then had to wait again for a smoothie (the whole order should be completed at once.) Staff did not smile, nor even looked remotely sorry for the 15+ minute wait. We had to wait to order our smoothies when there wasn't even a line in front of us. It was obvious that 9/10 people in the store were there for take out, but in the time I waited for 2 smoothies, I could've gotten an entire pizza for the same price with friendlier service. Jamba Juice has smaller smoothies for the same price, yet I would choose to go there any day."}
{"text":"I usually call ahead to place my order so that it can be ready when I arrive, or at least so I don't have to wait as long. Today when I called I was put on hold; expecting to be helped in a timely fashion, I stayed on the line. However, I was not helped at all, I stayed on the line for 15 minutes, still on hold when I arrived. When I got to the counter the person at the counter shouted back to the two behind her and asked who was on the phone, I responded for them, saying it was me who had been on hold for 15 minutes. The girl who had put me on hold said \"oh I forgot about that, oops.\" Very unprofessional. I'm very disappointed with the staff who was working on January 6 at noon."}
{"text":"Hannah was incredibly friendly and helped me out when the app wasn't working for me. She was a nice friendly face to see when I picked up my order at 6am. Just wish the app worked..."}
{"text":"I've done drive thru, ate in, and never had a problem with food, long wait time, or customer service. Love this location when I am craving a strawberry banana blueberry smoothie and a chipotle chicken club flatbread."}
{"text":"The wait time here is ALWAYS ridiculously long, even if it's just me in line. I really don't think I should sit in the drive thru window for 15 minutes for a smoothie."}
{"text":"Thought I'd give this place a try. Nope. Waited in the drive thru line for 30minutes (one car in front of me) and then I gave up backed up and left."}
{"text":"Horrible service! 2 people working on 3 customer orders, i ordered online and everyone who got there after me receieved their orders first. I let them know as soon as i walked in my name and that it was an online order. Once everyone received their order i went to the front to see what was going on and it turns out my order was in the fridge the whole time. Now i have a melted smoothie with nothing but peanut butter. Horrible experience time to go to the new smoothie place on Dysart!"}
{"text":"So the wife and I wanted a smoothie, I heard about this place.. Googled it and on our way we go.. Showed up at 709am and the hours on the door say hours of operation 7am-9pm but no one is here!  The hours on Yelp say 6am yet they are not open!  Don't waste your time with this place!"}
{"text":"So like most people I do reviews if I absolutely love a place or absolutely hate it. This location would be the latter. Seriously want to give it a zero stars but I can't. Basically I'm trying to watch my calories so decided to stop in here. What I like normally about Tropical Smoothie is they have a menu with calorie content and that helps me choose wisely. So I ordered my smoothie and the chicken pesto flatbread with an orange. First I got my smoothie which I asked to be made with Splenda. I took a sip and I didn't taste any sweetener at all. Again, trying to lose weight so I just let it go. I got my flatbread and chose to try some of my orange first. The orange had no flavor and was on the sour side, but we live in Las Vegas and good fruit is hard to come by. Again, I would let that pass. I took a bite out of my flatbread and noticed that the edges were warm but the chicken seemed room temperature. I continued to eat and the further into the flatbread I got, the colder the chicken became. This is supposed to be a HEATED flatbread. I decide to open it up to dissect it only to find one huge piece of chicken in the middle that has been pre-cut into 6 pieces. However, the employee didn't take their time to separate the pieces of chicken. So I basically had an ice cold huge block of chicken in the middle of my flatbread. At this point I was done. I think I took a couple more bites from the other side and ended up throwing everything away except my smoothie. I a chalk it up to the fact that I don't need the calories anyway. However, this was really lousy service. And while I was trying to eat my lunch, they messed up on two other people's orders. The other people chose to send their stuff back. In general I really like Tropical Smoothie but I will never go to this location again, no matter how convenient it is! I only wish that I actually took a picture of the chicken before I threw it out."}
{"text":"The food is DISGUSTING. I am a former tropical smoothie employee at a different location so I know how the food and smoothies are made. I ordered a regular chicken Caesar salad with the fake chicken; I got some weird one that had kale, spinach, ROTTEN LETTUCE, ROTTEN TOMATOES, and parmesan croutons. I guess that's they're new salad they're selling, but I specifically asked for a regular chicken Caesar. I'm pretty sure the employee was new because they used a huge tortilla for breakfast wraps; which was also very poorly put together. The employees really need to pay attention to not only orders, but also what they put in the food. Stop putting brown, soggy rotten lettuce and overly soft rotten tomatoes in salads and wraps. You'll end up giving someone food poisoning. This location definitely needs more training for their employees. The Trop on Horizon Ridge and Horizon is a million times better than this location. Don't go here unless you want poorly made food!"}
{"text":"Floor is a mess! Out of peanut butter what??? Literally what I came here for! Disappointed!"}
{"text":"I regret coming here every time. Some customer in front of me was waiting to get rung up for 20+ minutes! The guy Trevor in there looked like a walking zombie. They didn't have cappuccino for my mocha madness and they made me wait 30 minutes just to get my smoothie. A SMOOTHIE! Please everyone do yourself a favor and don't come here. The customer service is awful. I regret coming to this location every time. From this point on Jamba Juice is going to be my go to. Tropical smoothie is really spiraling downhill."}
{"text":"I never really know how to feel about Tropical Smoothie. I know it has the guise of being good for you, but they do add sugar or Splenda to thir drinks. What am I to believe?!?

I do like the smoothies and food here, but it is not a daily or even weekly hangout for me. I like to make my own veggie smoothies and I know I do it cheaper than $5 a pop. Food is okay, too, but again, I feel a little too much on the \"healthy\" side to actually be healthy. 

On the day in question I ordered a smoothie with mango, strawberry, orange, and pineapple. I wanted to put a lil rum in there and call it summertime, but I guess I will just have to wait. Service was friendly and smoothie arrived in record time. You win this time, Tropical Smoothie Cafe, but I'll get you one of these days."}
{"text":"It's another Tropical Smoothie Cafe, which means I'm just interested in it being \"up to snuff\" rather than something new to me. And this place did not disappoint, despite the interior being a bit odd to me. Good service and good food.

I've had smoothies from this TSC previously, but they were brought to me by others, so I hadn't actually visited this particular location. I finally did, so I can provide a full review.

The location is a good one for me, as it is convenient to me and also happens to be where a lot of runners and cyclists meet on the weekends for runs and rides. But the interior of this place is somewhat odd to me. It is very dark--you can see back into the kitchen, but it seems like they don't turn on the lights back there. There was an odd smell to the place when I visited. It wasn't anything horrible, but it was...odd. And to get to the restroom in the back, you have to walk a long ways--seemingly a longer ways than the building itself has to allow you, at least from looking at it from the outside.

But enough about location. The service was good. There was only one person on duty when I was there on a Saturday morning, but she was friendly and accommodating of my changes to the smoothie I ordered. I always appreciate that dairy is not in all the smoothies, and for those in which it is included, is always clearly called out. I also appreciate that they have pea protein in addition to whey and soy.

And the smoothies: I've had the peanut butter indulgent smoothie, and it's great! This is a delicious dessert smoothie that is definitely worth trying. I tend to go for the superfood and nutritious smoothies, and there are a number of good options. This last time, I went for the \"muscle\" smoothie that was advertised on a poster off the menu. It had roasted banana, peanut butter, protein (I specified pea protein), dates, oats (which I substituted for some berries), and a number of other items. It makes for a great quick breakfast!

There are a number of non-smoothie options as well. You can get sandwiches, tacos, quinoa bowls, and a few sides. I particularly like the kale and apple slaw. It has a honey mustard sauce on it that is quite tasty.

This is definitely my favorite smoothie chain. And being so convenient to me, I'll be back to this location."}
{"text":"Their smoothies are super good. But the service-not so much. Occasionally you'll find someone that is quick and efficient in making your food. But I like to get their sandwiches and a smoothie. Sometimes, when i'm waiting, I think that they forgot my order, but the person making the sandwich in the back is just SO SLOW. Good food. Not outstanding service."}
{"text":"Smoothie and sandwich were good.  Place needs a good cleaning.   Garbage behind counter.....in kitchen and behind location all overflowing with trash.  Had I not already paid and ordered I might not have stayed.  It was gross. Definitely an issue with keeping dining area clean as well."}
{"text":"In town for my daughters fastpitch softball tournament and one of her teammates swears on these smoothie cafe's and since this location is so close to the fields we decided to stop by for a something not so heavy.
Walking in the place was empty but we did not realize that there was drive thru as the workers seem to be running around busily.
We took our time looking at the menu and they offer more than just smoothies such as wraps, sandwiches, flatbread and more. They menu was pretty extensive as I was only expecting smoothies and had we been hungrier I definitely would have tried something as they all looked pretty delicious.
Our smoothies were great so the reasoning for the 3 stars is that they need to do more training and/or hiring as they are extremely SLOW, it literally took over 20 minutes for 2 shakes and after we entered a few more customers came in and they were also waiting for quite sometime as well. They had 3 workers which you would think would be sufficient but one was off helping out and they just all seemed to be running around with their heads cut off, hollering orders and such. Nice guys, just not very customer service oriented and professional."}
{"text":"I arrived at tropical smoothie to order lunch for my family.  There was one person working and I waited 10-15 minutes to order (I was first in line) I waited while she made the previous order and once she served me they were missing peanut butter for the peanut paradise so I went without and it took another 15-20 minutes to put 4 smoothies and 2 wraps.

I was in Tropical smoothie for almost half and hour before leaving with my take out food and drinks.

On a good note a young guy arrived advising he was here for his interview maybe just short staffed but it made for an annoying first experience at the new local tropical smoothie!

Oh and the last part I asked why the drink container was so flimsy well the response was the owner doesn't like to spend money on these types of things."}
{"text":"Great chain smoothie restaurant with same menu you'll recognize from other Tropical Smoothie Cafes. If you're a bit health conscious like me, be sure to ask for NO SUGAR in your smoothie! With the fruit in each one, you truly won't miss it, (and it's better for you!).

I stopped in today around 2pm to grab a salad and smoothie with a coupon I got in the mail. The place was packed, and it took over 20 minutes for my smoothie to be prepared. My salad was ready in 7 minutes... Not good! It's a new spot so I'm sure they're still sorting out the kinks. One thing to note, do not stand close to the bar around the smoothie blenders. I saw one employee squirting sugar syrup into a blender and it splashed all over a woman's blouse. She was annoyed and the employee didn't say anything to her... 2nd bad sign! I'd recommend some divider boards between customers and food prep."}
{"text":"Handle money for five minutes drop change on the dirty floor, pick it up and don't wash your hands before making smoothies...great....got the smoothie and it was all melted and gross. No thanks, I asked to return it, no one seems to care about anything here. I'll not be back."}
{"text":"INCOMPETENCE! THE WORKERS DID NOT THAW OUT ANY MEAT FOR THE DAY SO WHITE CHICKEN WAS UNAVAILABLE ON THE WHOLE MENU. I could understand if there physically had no chicken left, but the workers had said there was white chicken in the freezer but none thawed available. This ruled out practically all the food items on the menu; the only reason we had came to this location.

UPDATE 12/21/2016: we decided to revisit location in attempts to second effort. THE DOORS WERE CLOSED; EMPLOYEES WERE BLASTING MUSIC INSIDE. We waited outside in the cold so long other customers showed up. Door still didn't open. Employees still disregarded us. WE WERE THERE DURING OPEN HOURS TOO! It is 8:55PM I get off work from the other side of town at 7:30 just to get a meal and I cannot. WE HAD TO DRIVE ALL THE WAY TO A TROPICAL SMOOTHIE AN ADDITIONAL 15 MINUTES AWAY! They had no problem ACTUALLY being open. There is something very very wrong with this particular location.

The manager needs to either fire all his employees or the company needs to find a new manager to either be on duty or train his employees to perform as if he was on duty.

I NEED tropical smoothie to address this issue immediately and contact me before I escalate to corporate."}
{"text":"The drive thru wait is ridiculous I hate coming to spot because the drive thru sucks better off going to Jacky bee at the Thai bistro next door very unhappy customer to all the girls in the back they need better workers"}
{"text":"The rating would not let me rate 0 stars otherwise I would have. The service is awful and rude and they take a long time plus this location is filthy! Left this location to go to Jamba Juice on Sahara and had a great smoothie, clean location and service with a smile!"}
{"text":"Smoothie was delicious. The Super Chicken Caesar bowl that I paid $6 and waited in line $10 minutes for was an absolute disgrace!!"}
{"text":"I've always liked tropical smoothie but today I found what appeared to be a shredded contact lens in my smoothie. I've worked in retail for a long time and know that mistakes happen so I decided I would just notify the employees so they were aware. Upon walking up to the counter a girl made eye contact with me from the back but decided to keep talking to her fellow co-worker in the back. I waited patiently for her since the other employee was busy with customers at the front register. After the other employee's friend took off, I was finally approached. I told the girl, \"I found what appears to be a shredded contact lens in my drink\". At that point the other employee approached and after they both looked at the foreign object apathetically, the first employee asked, \"well do you want us to remake your drink or something?\". To which I said, \"No I just wanted to let you know\". There was no apology, no thank you. This was probably the worst experience I've had at a restaurant. I hardly every complain but I just thought I would put this review up so that people know not to go to this location. I super tempted to take back that $5 tip."}
{"text":"The worst experience I ever had 
The drive thru attendant  with red hair, 
Didn't know what's on her menu 
I explained I want a \"pomegranate plunge\" and turkey bacon ranch sandwich . I didn't understand what was hard to take in my order. 
It was frustrating how it took 20 minutes and 23 seconds  to go look at the menu  
It was a waste of my time. 

To keep it short let's just say I left hungry and upset and will never comeback."}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for a Smoothie, this is my 'go to' place.  It's in my neighborhood, so it's very convenient for me to get here.  My favorite Smooties are the Rockin' Raspberry (Raspberries, Strawberries, and Banana) or Paradise Point (Strawberries, Banana, and Pineapple).  I'll add a shot of protein in there for good measure, especially after a workout.

The employees here are always friendly.  The only problem I have with the service is that it can take a while if it's very busy.  In those cases, I won't wait and just come back another time.

Will I return?  Of course."}
{"text":"I stayed at Green Valley Ranch for a few days and every morning stopped by this location to get a Smoothie to start the day.  It's conveniently located in the food court near the conference rooms, so instead of Coffee, I got a Smoothie to start my day.  

My Smoothie of choice is the Rockin' Raspberry (Raspberries, Strawberries, Banana, w/shot of Whey Protein), $5.99.  It's very tasty and serves as a sort of meal replacement instead of eating a Pastry or Muffin before our conference sessions.

The employees here are friendly and from the 2nd day of my stay started making it for me as soon as they saw me in line....that's great service!

Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"Waited in the drive thru for 20 minutes only to get a smoothie that tasted like water. Wouldn't recommend this location to anyone with tastebuds."}
{"text":"They take forever if you try to do drive through. I was waiting for 15mins to give my order to them and another 15 mins waiting for me to pay them. This place overall is just waste of time if you're in a hurry to go. Especially when you only have an hour to eat."}
{"text":"I've been coming her for over a year now and I love this place. I have never waited more than 30mins for my smoothies. Also I have never ordered any food here just smoothies."}
{"text":"Both smoothies taste bland and free of fruit...MORE LIKE AN ICY SLUSH FROM SONIC!!! Terrible!  Highly disappointed...especially, with the Acai Berry Blast. There were not even fruit seeds from the strawberries, etc. makes me wonder if there was even fresh fruit in it at all (as they made it in the back)!!!"}
{"text":"Lesson learnt: I should ALWAYS read reviews/tips on here first and not just fly by somewhere on a whim because yesterday was one of the worst experiences I've had at a business where it took me 8.5 HOURS to make an order, not receive it and finally get a refund! If you have 5mins and want to laugh at my expense, I'll explain..

My partner and I had a small window of time (about 15-20 mins) before I had to drive him to work and our stomachs were rumbling, so the plan was to order a sandwich and a shake each and eat it on the way to dropping him off.
We bumped into TS and went inside to order. Greeted by a lovely lady who turned out to be the manager and took our order. Unfortunately the first smoothie I ordered, they didn't have the ingredients for, so I found something else and that was that.
About 5mins into waiting for our breakfast, the manager got an important call and had to leave. It wasn't until that time, when there was another customer waiting to be served, that she told her that 2 people had already called out that day, she had to go too and they were extremely short staffed with only 1 person left to serve the restaurant, deal with drive thru and make all the orders. Had we been told that this was the case when WE ordered, we would've known service would be very slow and would have opted to go elsewhere as our time was limited.

Nearly 20mins into our wait, we still had received nothing and had to go. We asked the guy (still the only server) if our order was nearly ready and he said he was \"just doing it now\" and said it'd be a further 10 mins. We told him we were sorry we couldn't wait any longer and had to leave with just a refund. We needed to leave so promptly that I said I'd come past again on the way back from dropping my partner to work for the refund, which he said was fine.

Cut to 30mins later. I'm back again for that refund and am glad to see that a second server has just turned up to help. He seems a bit confused at the thought of performing refunds, so I'm waiting a further 10mins while he calls his manager. He comes back to tell me he can't do it. He needs a managers key and the manager won't be back for a few hours. So a 2nd wasted journey here in the space of 1 hour!
He tells me not to worry, the manager would get my refund back to me. When I asked him how, he didn't seem to know and when I asked \"So if a customer needs a refund in the next few hrs you'll have to tell them 'too bad'?!\" The response was just \"yyyep\".
I was pretty shocked at the incapability and disorganisation of this business but had no choice but to come back later when I was assured a manager would be around at 7pm.

Cut to 7pm. I'm back. Just 1 server in the whole place AGAIN so I wait.. again! 

Guess what? He's not a manager and can't refund. Are you kidding me?!!

As I'm about to get massively frustrated at this poor server who has no idea of my morning with his colleagues, a manager walks in, clearly on a whim from their reactions. HOORAY anyway though.

After ANOTHER 15mins of this manager seemingly confused, pacing back and forth and not being able to pull up my order, I FINALLY GET A REFUND and run out of there. NEVER to return!

From reviews of this place, problems have been: lack of ingredients, lack of staff and very slow service, all of which I experienced today. It seems that TS have a good team of workers who just can't do their jobs properly due to poor management and massive disorganisation.

I will be avoiding this place from now on and can only recommend you do the same, if not, GOOD LUCK!!"}
{"text":"30 minutes for a smoothie?! Girls behind the counter were both slow and cold. Didn't seem like they cared about getting things out fast. One looked lost the other had a scowl the whole time.  Horrible service and smoothie was watery"}
{"text":"I come here continuously and it practically never disappoints! The triple berry oat is my go to smoothie and their flatbreads are really good too! I just recently had their new sriracha flatbread and it was delicious! Their crew is also very friendly!"}
{"text":"Awful. I ordered my usual Caesar wrap with chips and a smoothie and when I got home I noticed my chips were already open and half eaten. I'm disgusted because now I'm worried what they did to my wrap and smoothie. 
I called the store when I noticed and no one in the store answered. This was today, June 9 2018 around 3 pm with a young woman working - manager should get on this. 

When she asked me what chips I wanted and I asked if they had jalapeño chips she smirked and said yes really polite and it seemed weird but I thought maybe she was honestly trying to be nice, but once I thought about it, it most definitely seemed like she knew she was going to give me an open bag.. 

I'll probably never return to this store and I'll make sure to tell everyone about my experience."}
{"text":"I usually like Tropical Smoothie, not so much for the smoothies but for the food. The smoothies are never fully blended and has a bunch of ice chips in it.  The smoothies always taste plain and watered down.  The food is usually good... at other locations.  Every time I go to this location, the food is disgusting and the service is horrible.  Today, I felt like I was interrupting the teenage workers' hangtime session.  One of the girls seemed annoyed I ordered food... then I was told they were out of certain ingredients.  While waiting, the workers were chatting away, dancing, oh.. I don't want to forget the cuss words!  Very unprofessional... accompanied by some nasty food.  Won't be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"This location has the worst customer service. So slow... so expect to wait about 15-20 minutes for your order.  I don't even get smoothies from here because they always taste watered down with huge chunks of ice chips in it.  I come for the sandwiches... the ultimate club, and wasabi roast beef are delicious.   I cant come here anymore during my lunch break because its so slow. .. such a shame!"}
{"text":"They're more expensive than the other locations and the owner is a jerk. I ordered an omelette that is $2.99 at every other location. Here, the omelette is smaller and $4.49! They also don't honor the LVAC discount. I'm disappointed."}
{"text":"It is absolutely ridiculous that I have to wait 35 minutes to get 1 Smoothie and a salad. And the customer service here needs to be improved on as well."}
{"text":"I usually really like Tropical Smoothie but there were several things that made my visit today not good. It started with a long wait for an employee to come to the counter. There was no one in sight for awhile. There was no excitement on the staff's part to greet me once they arrived. Then when we received our order it was incorrectly taken and we were given the wrong sandwich. I was going to eat it anyways but it only had a tiny piece of chicken in it. It was a $6.95 sandwich so I was expecting more to the sandwich. The interior of the store needs an overhaul too. Hope this is helpful."}
{"text":"We went through the drive through and there were two girls standing at the drive through just chatting with the person inside. We were told they would \"be with us in a few moments\". So we waited for a while but then pulled around to try the inside because we were in a hurry and it turns out the girls had left even though we were still waiting. So we go to try and order food inside and the doors were locked at 1PM, when the hours posted are from 6AM-2AM. The customer service here was the worst I'd ever experienced."}
{"text":"This, being one of the few smoothie places of any kind to be open 24 hours is extremely convenient and aside from that, I live on the east side so it's close too. Everything is great and is what you'd expect from a decent business so I love it but it has one flaw: wait time. Unfortunately for the poor workers that do graveyard, there can be a long line of cars at 2 am. So I have had to wait like 15 minutes for a smoothie at times but please don't blame the workers at this time as they are by themselves doing their best. I'm a very patient and understanding person so I will always be fine in these situations- I  just to warn  others that may not want to deal with the wait time to expect it here."}
{"text":"The Absolute worst store!!!!!!! This is the 3rd time that they have screwed up my order and have done nothing about it. This time was really bad. I did an online order, clearly spelled out with what I wanted. Salad and smoothie. I sent my receptionist to pick up and she came back with a smoothie only and it was the wrong smoothie. I called in and let them know. The guy Billy that picked up was to say the least an idiot. He had no idea how to handle it and blamed it on me and the online order. I was charged twice for this and got nothing that I actually ordered and no food. So I paid $32 for a smoothie that tasted like crap. It was made poorly and had to be thrown out. It was that badly prepared. When I called back in the other guy was rude and had no idea how to seal with it and said a manager would have to call me after 3:00 because they did not know how to refund or do anything for that matter. I normally go to this location during the summer for breakfast and I can honestly say you have list my business over this. I will never go this Tropical smoothie again. I will travel down the way to Jamba Juice, they do not mess up my orders. My opinion is the 2 guys there need to be fired, they really do suck!"}
{"text":"Horrible. The worst tropical smoothie I have been to. Long line of 5-6 cars in drive thru so I decided to park and go in. Was excited because I was the only person in there and thought that the short walk was worth it for my lunch break. Boy was I wrong. 4 cars go through the drive they and still I wait. Now mind you, all these cars had drinks and food and 2 of them with large bags. Finally I asked where my order was and was told I was next. Next? So I guess my order went behind the cars in drive thru anyways. So if you go here and see a long line of cars and think by going in you'll save time, think again. Your order will be placed at the back of the line anyways, so just pull around and stay in your car. 
Did I say horrible?"}
{"text":"This location is a joke. Two visits in a row I had similar experiences. Both times the employee working the counter appeared to be high or drunk... Probably both. Today, they were out of two menu items the. When asked about the third on the promo banner he said they don't make it anymore. When the food was done he just threw the bag on the counter and walked back into the kitchen area, forgot the sides, didn't call a name, nothing. Good god... Put this place out of its misery."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday afternoon while walking around University Circle.   The staff was very pleasant and helpful.  I was not sure what I wanted to what to get and he was very patient and gave some great suggestions for my son.  The store was clean.  It was a nice day and we wanted to be outside and the guy behind the counter brought us our order; which I thought was a nice gesture.  If I lived near here, I would come in more often."}
{"text":"I stopped in to get a quick bite to eat, I haven't had one of their wraps in a few months, so I decided to order their Thai Chicken Wrap. When I got back to the office and opened it I was so surprised that the wrap was so small. I remember getting the wrap months ago and they were so much bigger, almost to the point where I could not eat the other half.  
It was a tiny wrap with very minimal chicken and to be honest it was mainly tortilla. 

This Tropical smoothie has messed up my order in the past so I was on the fence about going their, but after this experience it is safe to say that I will not be back."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm eating healthy whenever I eat here even though in reality that may not be the case. I have been her for all three meals once and each time, I wanted to come back. As the name says, you can get a bunch of different fruit smoothies here (and yes there are tropical fruit assortments). I've gotten the carrot one, acai berry, strawberry banana, and blueberry one before. They were all delicious minus the occasional brain freeze (tip: put your tongue on the roof of your mouth, it helps) 

As for food, they got these yummy wraps (buffalo chicken and thai chicken are my favorites) and flatbreads which are also great (baja chicken and Carribean chicken). They have a sweet deal on Mondays for a flatbread, drink, and chip or fruit for $5. 
Flatbread combos everyday are quite affordable anyways though (5.99).

Overall, this is a quick place with quality food and you feel like you're getting the full serving of veggies and fruits!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed with my experience. Drive thru was disgusting! Window was filthy with fingerprints and stains all over. Drive thru attendant was unfriendly and unprofessional. The attendant looked unsanitary and his hands were sweaty when exchanging money. I was so disgusted I did not want to drink my smoothie. Proceed with caution!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. They offer a variety of smoothies for people with all kinds of tastes or diet preferences (dairy comes to mind).

I did find out today why the smoothies are so tasty - the giant helping of turbinado they put in them.  Yes folks, they put in an entire scoop from a large ladle that is at least a third of a cup if not a half a cup.  Golly gee that's a ton of sugar, even if unrefined.

Next time I go I'll only ask for half or even less sugar.  They are so sweet, I doubt I will notice much difference anyway.  I would still recommend this place though!"}
{"text":"Overall I enjoy eating at TSC, they have really delicious wraps and smoothies (I usually get the king Caesar wrap with a sunrise sunset). 

If I could, I would deduct 1/2 stars off because they didn't have any alternatives to not having any gift cards I wanted to purchase and it felt like the staff didn't looked as hard."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times, always looking to give it a second chance but without fail they get worse every time. Waited 15 minutes in the drive thru to get ONE smoothie. Last time I came here I waited 10 minutes. Seriously, unless you have an extra 30 minutes to spare to get one smoothie DO NOT come here. 

Not to mention after waiting for 15 minutes you would think that I would have the most heavenly smoothie in the world but no all I got was a cup of sour tasting smoothie. I love tropical smoothie but I will never be coming here again."}
{"text":"No customer service at this location. Walk in and you'll no greeting or even how can we help you. You'll end up standing there waiting until you tell them, hey! Can I purchase a smoothie. Employees don't acknowledge you. When we came to this location one employee was sitting on the floor eating chips with her head on the counter. Really? Would you really want this person handling food you're about to eat? They serve lettuce Thad already browned. They don't make their smoothies right, you'll end up with missing ingredients and they're watered down. When you ask for a return you'll be told no, or they could remake your food. But why would you after your first experience and how the employees present themselves. Ask for a regional managers number to assist you, and magically they'll be able to return your purchase. Beware of Donna, the manager. Heavy set with purple-pink something hair that wears military dog tags. We were being pleasant about our poor quality food. But she wasn't it back. Also, why does no one where name tags here? Her name probably isn't even Donna. Shame. There's other locations near by that'll give you better quality food and service. Please, save your time!"}
{"text":"So I've never actually written a bad Yelp review before, but this place... we walked it and it smelled like a sewer, with trash on the floor. In the bathroom, the soap dispenser was broken off and laying on top of the toilet. I didn't wash my hands from the toilet dispenser, and I don't know if any employees could. The smoothie looked delicious, but after reading another review about food poisoning, we just threw it away and left. Hoping the ownership can provide better support to this location. :("}
{"text":"So sorry I have to leave one star.... but when you stop by to have lunch and they have \"no food\" posted on door..... only takes one time to ruin it.... what a shame"}
{"text":"I feel like every time I go to a Tropical Smoothie, they have 2 employees running the entire store.

I recently visited last Friday, and walked right up to the register. After deliberating for a couple minutes, and picking the Bahama Mama, I ordered. 

Then, it took forever to actually get my smoothie. I believe there was one employee on the cash register and one actually making the food/smoothies. And since I came around lunch time, the place was shortly packed. Soon, both employees were in the back churning out smoothies and not taking any orders. And despite being one of, like, the first four people in during the lunch rush, it still took about 15-20 minutes to actually get my smoothie. Also, why is this place ALWAYS freezing cold. I considered sitting outside, in the 100 degree heat at one point since it was so cold. 

At least the smoothie was good."}
{"text":"How great is this place? I love the selection and combinations they offer here! I also adore that they only have one size and it's actually quite massive. My husband usually ends up finishing mine after he's slurped the last of his. Service is friendly and pretty fast, it's perfect for a warm desert day. 

The only suggestion I have for this location is that they invest in some air conditioning, cuz it was brutally hot inside. bleck."}
{"text":"It's a sad thing, really. This location is less than a mile from our house, and we usually swing through on a weekend when headed out for errands and grocery shopping. The thinking is that we'll fill ourselves us with something nourishing and delicious so we don't throw everything we see into the cart (including things that are terrible for us). 

The last 3 or 4 times we've been here, it's been a total disappointment. It's either that they try to talk us into getting something other than what we've asked for, or they give us something that we didn't order, or what we receive is just overwhelmingly intense....whereas we've had it at other locations and it was great. 

There is never a line, but we've never been through the drive through under 15 minutes. On this trip, it was 22 minutes and a girl came to the window and asked us if we ordered the Jetty Punch and a limeade, and we had to correct her and tell her that we ordered the Detox and Avocolada (which were disgusting). 

We won't be back. A shame that we can't have something healthy and dependable on the North Side."}
{"text":"Good products, great prices but service is always BAD. They are always UNDER staffed! Takes for ever to order or to get your meal! Do not go on your lunch break it will take 30plus minutes to get a smoothie and a sandwich. Today it's only ONE guy trying to run the hole place this franchise needs some customer service training."}
{"text":"I love Tropical smoothie buuuut, I was Not impressed with my smoothie from here. I got the lean machine (my go to).  It was watered down no flavor. The staff was courteous and I didn't have to wait long. But my experience didn't meet the expectation I've become accustomed to"}
{"text":"My Ex introduced me to this place with the LEAN MACHINE and I love it and it works so now I'm addicted. Gilbert staff is awesome. I've never had to wait in line for long, staff is polite, and quick and the manager/owner is a cool guy. I have been to other locations and I just really like the vibe here. There is a certain care they put into it. Happy hour is BOGO from 5- 7."}
{"text":"Expect them to be out of the 1st 3 things you order. Almost every time I come in they are out of multiple items required to make a sandwich or a smoothie. I don't even know why I'm giving it 1 star if there were another smoothie place near my house I would never go here!"}
{"text":"This is the worst Tropical Smoothie location I have ever been to. 

Avoid.

They can't ever get the order right, they will refuse to make orders late at night and recently they told me the only sandwiches they do in the sandwich and half combo is the Ultimate Club or the Turkey Bacon Ranch. Since when?  Also, apparently Splenda is an upcharge.  I'm done with this location. 

Go ahead and drive to Blue Diamond or Durango. It's definitely worth it"}
{"text":"I've never eaten at Tropical Smoothie, but my ex-girlfriend raves about it, so a buddy and I split a sandwich there.  We got the roast beef with horseradish sauce.  I was disappointed, he thought it was OK.  Would have rather spent half the money for shitty fast food.  I dunno, I just expected more from Tropical Smoothie."}
{"text":"This location has been having on going issues since I started visiting the last 3 months.  The smoothies are great so no problem there.  Some individuals on the staff maybe need some more training.  I've gone in to order a smoothie on one occasion and had two guys have their smoothies and food served before mine.  Also another customer was served before I was.  I ordered my drink before these 3 guests.  Spoke to the cashier and he just mentioned that they were busy sorry.  Okay, one time no biggie.  Separate occasion during a drive threw order.  I ordered my drink and paid no problem.  I'm waiting...4 cars are now behind me.  Still waiting.  Looked over at the counter and see about 1 bag of food and 4 smoothies ready to go.  Finally a guy opens the window and asked if I had already paid, yes.  Asked if I had ordered food, Nope.  At this point I'm asking myself where's the cashier that took my order?  These are small issues but it's annoying and I'm starting to look for other options."}
{"text":"I love love the Smoothies! .....I use the drive thru and the shop is new.... But the window and little shelf are filthy!!!  And getting dirtier by the day. Who knows how dirty the inside is. The line is so slow and every time I get up to the filthy window I'm told how sorry they are because we never have enough employees. I love your product.. But I think you need some hands on managers on site! It's pretty obvious . This location is Green Valley Parkway by Horizon Ridge."}

Quick Review
+   Service -- in the morning -- is great.

+/- Smoothies are alright. Aaaaight. Service during lunchtime is hit or miss. Don't come here in a rush. Like at all ... 

-    Free smoothie during birthday was not honoured. Check the check-ins, yo. I ain't a newbie. They wouldn't honour a single birthday freebie for a stupid ass reason and I will never set foot in here again. One-star all up in yo' face! 

-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-------------------

I am not necessarily proud of this, but I have tried nearly every smoothie and sandwich on the menu. Not every smoothie at some Tropical Smoothie Café® at some point, but almost every smoothie from their menu exclusively at this location.  

Why? Well ... ain't shit else open (besides McDonald's®) around here that early. And I need shit to eat early. It is right across the street from the CSN campus. 

Service is fine in the morning.

Now, what is my proverbial beef here? I've been here dozens and dozens and dozens of times (verified check-ins: 58, although I have been here more times than that) after all. 

I received a birthday email for being in their E-Club (which is worthless, by the way [not just because they won't honour what is sent, but because there is no point to it]) and printed it out like a good lil' soldier. 

Pro Tip: The E-Club is useless. Don't join it.

For whatever reason (I am not IT), my name did not print with the stupid email. I don't know. Don't really care. My name is on my ID card and I have the printed electronic mail. If one would go through the trouble of searching for the email template just to ... what ... photoshop someone's name off of it ... don't you think that you would just also insert one's own fucking name in there? I mean: seriously. 

Pro Tip: Photoshop your fucking name on there if it prints sans. 

No one accused me of photoshopping another person's name off of it; however, how else would it be nameless if they are insistent that they are never sent that way and they cannot honour it. The manager said fuck off in not so many words. 

I had been here over sixty fucking times in a relative short period of time. If they shit on a regular customer like that, what kind of service do you think you will get while going through the drive-thru or just dropping in one day. 

Possibly the second worst run Tropical Smoothie Cafe® on Planet Earth* ....

*Second last to the Red Rock Resort one.

I don't play games: enjoy your one-star from a long-time customer that will never patronise this location again. Cheers!

Pro Tip: Ask for the manager to be fired.

In A Sentence
(A) Tropical Smoothie Café® that sucks really badly, due to indifference. 

Quick Review
+   Location. Only positive is where it is.

-   Service is never good. ¡Nunca!

-   No breakfast until 8 A.M. (other than smoothies and other cold shit). I suspect is because they don't want to actually prepare the food they are paid to actually fucking prepare. 

------------------------------------------

I have tried a couple of smoothies, sandwiches, and wraps here. (Check the check-ins!) 

Service is fine ... never.

Now, what is major proverbial beef here?

I think they tell you they won't make breakfast sandwiches/wraps before 8 A.M. because they don't feel like making them. Automatic minus three stars for that.

Pro Tip: 
Don't come hungry in the morning. There is a Tropical Smoothie Café® a couple of miles east on Charleston where the employees will actually do their job. 

Pro Tip: 
Don't bring a survey promotion here. They won't honour it. Take it a couple of miles east on Charleston.

Possibly the worst run Tropical Smoothie Café® on Planet Earth* ....

Pro Tip: 
Just don't come here at all and go a couple of miles east on Charleston if at all possible.  

Pro Tip: 
Ask for the manager to be fired.

{"text":"Waited for 2 smoothies and a wrap for well over 25 minutes in the drive thru. Absolutely ridiculous!  It wasn't like they were busy or anything. Only one person inside the restaurant and I was the only one in the drive thru. Now there's three people behind me looking just as frustrated as I am, still waiting on their orders. The manager needs to do something about this place and the young kids who are supposed to be working in there!  The girl at the window said she was the only person working, which doesn't make sense to me. I would not waste my time in that place again!"}
{"text":"Waited in the drive thru for a solid 5 mins before finally being acknowledged and placing our order. We were told they would have our total at the window. Once we pulled up we waited another 5 mins at the window without someone even coming and asking us to wait so we left. We saw the employees talking and laughing inside as we drove by, definitely not working on our order."}
{"text":"Too bad we don't have this place in LA. Much better than the big chain smoothie joint we have here."}
{"text":"This place is called Tropical Smoothie, so I tend to stick with ordering a smoothie. The Island Greens is a great smoothie. Normally can't stand kale, but it seems to work for this smoothie. The buffalo chicken wrap and the Thai chicken wrap are decent low calorie wraps with great flavors. Service is usually fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Good food and smoothie, terrible service! Shouldn't have a drive thru and 2 associates trying to get it all done... I'd suggest corporate takes a look at this!"}
{"text":"They always take 5 or more minutes in the drive through. I have had them completely forget about my order and go on to help others. The outside as well as inside is unclean.

I would recommend going a few miles down the road to Jamba Juice it may take longer to drive there; however overall you will save time and frustration.

The smoothies are good if you can deal with poor service and unclean environment."}
{"text":"Only one person working and no customers in the shop. Clearly didn't care about us or our order."}
{"text":"I want to come here al the time.

This place has affordable and deliciously healthy smoothies. They open 2 hours before smooth kings, great for when you want a smoothie before noon.

Oh, the staff is friendly and they have stellar vegetarian options. I'm loving the hummus wrap."}
{"text":"Great customer service! We were greeted with smiles and the atmosphere was very pleasant. There were 4 of us and we all got our food and smoothies within 10 minutes. Delicious as always. I'm hooked."}
{"text":"As far as the food goes, it was DELICIOUS! My mother and I shared the Jamaican Jerk Chicken wrap- spicy, just how I like it and flavorful! I had the Avocolada smoothie and was throughly impressed with its yumminess. 
BUT when we turned around to choose our table, we struggled to find an appealing place to enjoy our food. The whole cafe was a mess and the service was underwhelming. 
I'd come here again, but I'll get it Togo."}
{"text":"So... has anyone ever been to a Tropical smoothie that didn't take a minimum of 15 - 20 min to get their order? If so, I would like to meet you and shake your hand! This place takes FOREVER! This particular time was insane! And after we finally got our order, the 8 people standing in line we're still waiting to be rang up. 6 people have now left and the remaining two are still waiting to be rang up. After what's now been at least 15 min. No cashier or employees anywhere?"}

{"text":"The good, the bad, and the ugly. 

The good: smoothies are delicious, food is tasty, and they have healthy options. Bonus they are open late or all night! 

The bad: their customer service is terrible. I'm talking worst I've ever seen. They are lacking general social skills in general. They will let you stand there for a solid 5 minutes And never greet you. Honestly it is strange and awkward. Never encountered anything like it. And this is a regular occurrence, I'm a weekly visitor. 

The ugly: the food is alway sloppy and never looks good.  If they are super busy sometimes the smoothies are not blended all the way."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! The staff is friendly and super fast. The food is great and the smoothies are healthy, fresh, and taste out of this world good! Great colorful atmosphere. Great music. I loved my Chicken sandwich and Peanut butter and banana Smoothie! My grandson loved his quesadilla and strawberry smoothie! The place was immaculate. A 98.7 health rating. They will be putting outdoor furniture and Cornhole out a bit later! Love it!"}
{"text":"Love this Tropical Smoothie Location!
Friendly, Courteous, Great Energy! The staff seems like they enjoy coming to work and Smiles are free. I love the Mango Moxic Smoothie (hold the peach) even if it isn't on the menu. And the Kiwi Quencher is so good after being out in the heat...Very Refreshing! 
I Love You...Never Leave Again!"}
{"text":"Terrible service and attitude from employees do not come here!It takes 25 minutes to make a smoothie and the employees have no care for their customers time.

{"text":"I sent this email to the owner:


Hello Brian,

I'm very disappointed with the service I received from your establishment today.

As you can see from the receipt,  we ordered almost 4.00 worth of supplements to each of our smoothies, this would cause an overflow to our drinks, which should have been given to us automatically.

To my dismay, we only received the amount that poured in our cup, and when I asked for the extra, I was told I had to pay extra for that.

The worker stated that was your own policy after I informed her that the other Tropical Smoothies give it automatically.

That was extremely appalling to be told I have to pay extra for the \"extra\" when I already did in fact pay for it when I added all those supplements.

This is not good business practice if this is in fact how you run your business."}
{"text":"By far the rudest manage I have ever seen in my life to the other employee all because the kid took my order , so he scolds him in front of customers \"don't take a order if you can't ring it up \" I'll never be back , owner needs to wake up and fire that clown !!!!!!!! Bad for business will never be back"}
{"text":"I want to give them the best of the service and the smoothies. My wife want to drink carrot juice and they specially made for her with carrot and banana with strawberry. Also their chicken wrap not bad either. Most fun we got is their scratches, you can win everytime somethign free or discounted.. :)"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!  We've been there three times and I love it more each time.  Fresh, healthy food made in-store. They offer you a choice of chips or a piece of fruit (usually an orange or a banana) with your sandwich/salad or soup.  They have wraps, flatbread sandwiches and real sandwiches.  I've had their Thai Chicken wrap (chicken, wontons, carrots, sesame seeds, romaine, thai peanut dressing on a white tortilla) and their Salsa Sunrise wrap for breakfast (eggs, ham, bacon, pepper jack, salsa on a white tortilla).  Let me tell you, their salsa is SPICY!  Whew!!  Both were absolutely delicious!  The breakfast wrap I particularly enjoyed because the ingredients were fresh and you can choose from the junior size (only $1.99!!) or the regular size ($3.99).  The junior size and a smoothie is just right for the a.m. for me.  The smoothies are made with turbinado instead of sugar, or they will make them with Splenda if you ask.  I personally have tried the Blimey Limey (strawberries, pineapple, orange and lime), the Blue Lagoon (blueberries, strawberries & banana), the Sunny Day (mango, banana, orange & kiwi), and the Sunrise Sunset (strawberries, pineapple, mango & orange).  They were all wonderful, but the Sunny Day was my favorite, not too tart or too sweet.  My husband swears by their coffee smoothies, and he loves the Cinn CIty (cinnamon, coffee, cappuccino & non-fat yogurt) the best.  They have a wide variety of supplements to add to your smoothie, and I noticed there is not a lot of aftertaste (like there is at other smoothie stores) when used in their smoothies.  Will continue to patronize this little shop because we LOVE it!"}
{"text":"Great smoothies! The Health Nut is my absolute favorite. It is a little wait due to short staff at times but the smoothies are delicious."}
{"text":"Monday, February 20 , 2017 - receipt time stamp 1:21 - server says Carli C

Walked in, two girls working. Short hair on one, long hair on the other. Long hair girl only seems to know how to make food, not smoothies or work the register. The short hair girl appears to run the register, make the smoothies and walk them out to people. 

When I walked in there was a woman standing at the counter - I do not know the whole story but it seemed awhile had passed before they starting helping her. The short haired girl took her order and she sat down. Then when I walked up she said it would be a minute. NOT OK. Especially since there were two more women behind me, and another family walking in. So, the short hair girl made the smoothies, walked them out to her. The other girl made her food. 

Then the short hair girl took my order. Then I went to the bathroom but I heard her tell the two women behind me it would be a minute. I came out from the restroom and the two women asked if the girl with long hair could at least take their order because they were in a hurry, she said I shyness I could but wrote it down, didn't use the systems. The short hair girl came and walked my drink out - now back track to when I put my order in, she asked for my name, why she didn't use it is beyond me, it would of saved her some time. 

Needless to say, the customer service was crap. Operations are crap. Both of these ladies need to be trained on everything and quick. No name tags were worn. The girl with the long hair looked so disheveled and her hair was a mess. The girl with the short hair seemed a little annoyed or just having a lousy afternoon. 

I just want the owners/management/whoever is in charge - that my experience was worth the time writing this as I enjoy Tropical Smoothie very much more then Jamba Juice and I'd like to see you stay in business near my home. However it's going to take more then tasty smoothies to keep clientele!!

Peach Silk Smoothie was amazing though!!!"}

Not so nice with the customer service.     Ahhh I walked to get exercise and trying to get a healthy drink......    hmmm.   Btw it 10:30 pm.        Here's an idea.   If the manager or owner is reading this.     He happy that people are out getting exercise and wanting to get a healthy drink.          Yeah you can have the front doors locked just serve them through the drive-thru so your employees can feel safe."}

I had the Jamaican Jerk Chicken wrap and my wife had the King Caesar wrap.  I had a Hawaiian Breeze Smoothie with my meal.  

The wraps were very tasty and the price was good.  They have a special of two wraps for $9.99.  

This made a quick take out stop for an early dinner I had to have before meeting s friend near the Strip. I'll return.  There are other things on the menu that need trying and this is a good alternative for fast food."}
{"text":"I HAVE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH THIS PLACE!

I go on my way to work, and just love all the different smoothies that they have.  I think I have almost had everyone on the menu and I love adding the extra goodies like Spirulina or Whey Protein.  The person who owns it and their staff are hard working and put alot of effort into there stuff and you can taste the results.

Every sandwich on the menu is entertaining and not boring or the same ol same ol.  The bread used on the sandwiches is very fresh and soft as well.  The flatbead sandwichs are good too.

My favorite is the island combo where you can get half a sandwich and a smoothie for 6 bucks.  Just awesome.

oh, and also pick up a club card.  I have gotten a few free smoothies already."}

I was pleasantly surprised at the menu options what seemed to be a corporate worker who took my order. He had great suggestions and offered me a smoothie that was no longer on the menu but it was a great meal replacement. All employees were very friendly and I look forward to trying out the food menu."}

  I told her I just placed an order. She asked me \"where, online?\" I had to tell her I just ordered at the drive-thru. Then a young man looked over and said \"oh we're just waiting for cups.\" He then sniffs and wipes his nose on his sleeve.
   Between some guy wiping snot on himself, and a girl with hair likely to fall in my smoothie, I told her I was not comfortable doing business with them and left. This place is disgusting."}
{"text":"This is a franchise concept.  Doesn't really have a innovated environment in comparison to competition, however it does supply really good smoothies. This concept only has one size and pretty set Price's which I can appreciate. 

I am personally rating the drinks here not food"}
{"text":"Love the smoothies and sandwiches BUT very bad customer service. The last time I came had to wait 20 minutes for a smoothie. Was just there & I walked out. One employee up front counting money and said someone will be right with you. I looked in the back, one employee on her cell phone making smoothies another one came up front to talk to the one counting money. Didn't acknowledge me standing at the register. She then scratched her head them went in the back to make a sandwich without washing her hands...she put on gloves but who knows what else she touched. I walked out because it didn't look like they wanted my business"}
{"text":"Ok. The smoothies are good. I have been coming to this place since it opened. I stopped for a while, when I began working out of the area, but started again recently.  I'm not sure how much longer I will be able to handle it. Sometimes the staff is friendly, but most times they are simply teenage kids that are working without supervision. I can deal with that. What I find troubling is how disgusting the place has gotten. The floors are sticky, the tables are all askew and there is spilled smoothie every where. It really kind of has a gross vibe to it."}
{"text":"Absolutely THE WORST customer service I have EVER received at a place like this. 

Story goes like this...I watched the employees repeatedly pour out nearly 1/2 of the blender into the sink after each smoothie made., wasting tons of perfectly edible food. As someone who likes to give back and help out where I can, I asked the girl to please save the remaining smoothie so that 1) I could try to find someone homeless to give the remaining smoothie to or 2) take it home to my little brother. At first she was very kind about it, and told me she would be more than happy to do so. 7-8 smoothies made later when I finally thought my smoothie was up, and after watching the other employee (a very nice guy btw) pour the remaining content of the blender into a cup on the side, the woman told me that actually was not my smoothie. Fine, no issue. But then...girls goes and whispers to her colleague to discreetly take the other cup into the back. So, I clearly watched him take the remaining smoothie (the same exact one I had ordered mind you) and take it into the back stock area. The girl then told me mine was up next and told me it would be done in just a minute. I kindly reminded her again to put the contents of the leftovers into a side cup and she nodded in agreement. Immediately after pouring my smoothie, however, she turned her back and dumped water into the blender, turned back to me and said \"OOPS! So sorry, I forgot you wanted the rest on the side!\" Homegirl clearly thought I was born yesterday because she continued to defend herself claiming it was \"an accident.\" Yeah, not buying it - 100% intentional and hands down some of the shittiest customer service I have personally ever received anywhere ever. The manager should be ashamed to have someone willing to behave so childishly. Oh let's also not forgot that she claimed having never asked her colleague to take the other smoothie and put it in the back. Watch your damn video surveillance and I promise you, promise you, you will see who was right."}
{"text":"In all the times I've been here, I've never encountered a nice employee. I used to love tropical smoothie and now it feels like a chore??"}
{"text":"Smoothies are fine but they are horribly slow. I order five smoothies, which one person works on. The rest of the employees work on people who came after me. I watch seven smoothies leave from people who ordered after me. Had more than one person worked on my order I would've gotten it in a reasonable amount of time"}
{"text":"This is a rare gem and I am excited to have found it. On my road to a healthier body mind and soul I have found this amazing place. Using the smoothies as a meal replacement I have been able to work on my body inside and out. Everyone is very polite when I come in and the food and smoothies are great. I obviously have my favs in who makes the smoothies yet always consistent and customer service will rectify any issues. Thank u tropical smoothie cafe. See you mañana"}
{"text":"This location is faster and  gives greater service  than the S. Green Valley Pkwy and Carnegie location . Kudos to the  2 ladies ! They are fast! Just  went into this store again August 30 ,3pm I asked the young man  why I was charged 5.94 for a Mango Magic when its usually 5.40. I asked if the price went up, he didn't seem to know."}
{"text":"Slow at best and glacial at worst, this Tropical Smoothie will probably take longer than any other in the valley. I have never seen more than one person working here, and with just one or two people in front of you in line, you're looking at a 15+ minute wait. Go to a different location if possible."}
{"text":"-1 star = Not a drive through location which sucks.
-2nd star = their food tastes are not consistent with other Tropical Smoothie Cafes.

But there is outdoor seating, and sometimes they WILL get it right."}
{"text":"I love the island green smoothie with soy protein powder. Quick, easy and great prices!"}
{"text":"Every time I've come to this location they've make me late to work with how long they take to make my smoothie .. it's taken them longer then 20 minutes to make it , it should not take that long to make a smoothie , don't go here if you wanna wait that long."}
{"text":"Hit the drive through and when I got home I realized that 1/2 of my smoothie was a block of solid ice.

3 stars since the other handful of times I have been through it has been OK."}
{"text":"This place is always the same, consistent.  Their sandwiches and wraps are always tasty and their smoothies are refreshing.  It doesn't matter which location I've been too, they are all quality."}
{"text":"Had a pretty good turkey sandwich with bacon on ciabatta and some decent macaroni salad.  Will go back."}
{"text":"I work right above Tropical Smoothie Café and went almost everyday.  The gentleman behind the register is wonderful HOWEVER the staff in the back area are just plain rude.  Definite attitudes and I decided that there are too many wonderful places in Metropolitan to have to put up with that.  Food was good and the smoothies delightful but I won't go back!"}
{"text":"Smoothies always yum. My daughter loved breakfast sandwich going 2-3 times a week but they no longer have them so haven't been since because the wait it always so long."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would, the children working here have the worst work ethic and make it seem like an inconvenience to make a smoothie. Your job isn't that hard, get over it"}
{"text":"Never been inside to see the state of affairs there, but literally every single time we've been to this location, they're out of something we want.  Get on top of your inventory, people!"}
{"text":"This was awful. It took over 15 minutes to place an order, 30 minutes to get our food and then the smoothies were nothing but ice, water and kale shavings. I should have gotten my money back. We're telling our entire company to stop walking over!"}
{"text":"Phone ordered wraps to go, nice customer service from Alma! Jerk Wrap was yummy"}
{"text":"Worst tropical smoothie ever mind as well just shut this place down. This is the only location I know that runs out of everything every time I visit. One incidence I went through the drive through the guy says \"were only taking orders for food there's no regular sized cups\" like what?? That's like Mcdonalds running out of buns or Taco Bell running out of tortillas and taco shells. Recently I ordered a chicken Caesar salad they took forever to make it about 15 mins then when I get home to eat it there's no \"Chicken\". So I got a chicken Caesar salad with no chicken?? Soooo I guess I must've ordered a Caesar salad and I didn't know it ....NOT! I wish Jamba Juice sold more of a variety of food or I'd go there instead for. The Customer service is horrible and clearly management doesn't care. This place use to be convenient now it's just annoying just shut the place down smh"}
{"text":"I found this place during my last couple of days at the Green Valley Ranch Resort in Henderson (just outside Vegas).  If I actually paid attention sooner and looked at their full menu, I would've been here more often.  They not only have great smoothies, but also had great pita wraps and sandwiches.  Try the pesto chicken pita, they're made fresh and they actually LOOK like the pictures advertising them. You don't see that often.  They actually had breakfast sandwiches too, which sounded really good, but never got the chance to try them.  The staff members on my two visits were really friendly and helpful in giving me some pointers on their best items.  I'm hoping to find one of these in Chicago soon."}
{"text":"The smoothies are good here I wish it was one closer to where I live it's a good place to get something fruity and refreshing"}
{"text":"Service is on point. Poor. Why is there even a tip bucket? They should have a comment box instead"}
{"text":"I've been in and gone through the drive thru a few times now. My order is always right and they are normally pretty quick."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service in the drive through. The man we had didn't even greet us properly after having waited at the order box for 5 minutes. No hello. No thank you. He didn't even read us back the order nor did he tell us what our total was. Very rude. Tropical smoothie: train your employees correctly

The drive-thru line takes forever. I actually am writing this review right now as I sit in my car with 3 other vehicles in front of me.

We have been in this drive thru for over 15 minutes now.

Update. We are now finally at the window. Man did not even say hello and just told us the order. Uneventful. Man did not even give us a receipt so I could put his name down. 

Worst drive thru service I have ever gotten at a tropical smoothie."}
{"text":"Just stopped by with my family for some healthy smoothies. First impression was okay, Jasmine was the cashier. My husband asked what was the best drink on the menu. She suggested the \"sunrise\" We ordered, they seemed like they couldn't handle the small crowd (only about 4 clients total) 3 staff members. After we ordered, there was a couple left behind us, one of Jasmine's \"friends\" walked in, she completely ignored the couple ran up to her friend and hugged him, grabbed her juice and left. No explanation! SO UNPROFESSIONAL. I also ordered a half sandwich. The guy making my sandwich had no idea what went in it or what the ingredients were. It took about 20 minutes for me to get my sandwich. The team was not very friendly. Jasmine then returned. Upon her return, she had a very bad attitude. My husband really didn't like his smoothie. It tasted very bland. I hate to return things that we don't like, but I wanted him to be happy with his drink. Mine was okay, not the best. I apologized for returning his drink but asked if they could please remake his and make it more fruity or with more flavor because my husband really didn't like it. Jasmine rolled her eyes, muttered something under her breath and shot the cup in the garbage as if she was shooting a basketball. She then said something rude and her friend laughed. I couldn't believe her attitude. I stayed quiet because I didn't want her spitting in my husbands drink.. Worst attitude ever. WILL NEVER RETURN HERE AGAIN!!!!!"}
{"text":"Why haven't I been here for lunch before? The acai berry booster smoothie is so delicious. I thought this would help me sustain for a couple at work but then I also ordered the chicken Thai wrap. Super good. It taste healthy but it's also delicious. This combination makes me feel good. Just like their slogan eat better, feel better. There was only one worker when I came in for lunch. I felt bad because after I ordered food and a drink, more customers walked in. It did take a couple minutes to make which was understandable. I will come back more often for a healthy lunch. #newyearnewme haha"}
{"text":"Updating review because we have seen changes. Came two Saturday's in a row and service was friendly and quick. Very happy to see the changes. Also, the girl up front is on her A game always."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a couple years but the service has gotten worse. A couple days ago it took almost 20 minutes to get my smoothie. I then waited five minutes for my fruit melody, for a dollar I just left. Imaging having to wait over 25 minutes for a fruit cup seriously? There where 3 people working, 1 in the front and 2 in the back. Tonight I go and almost waited 30 minutes for a smoothie, I think I'll go back to Jamba Juice."}
{"text":"Maybe it gets busy for the number of employees on duty, I get that. But that doesn't mean it's okay to forego good customer service. On some visits the employees at this location seem to be in a poor mood. It seems to be with the drive through more than the walk-in service.

During their Buy 2 get 1 free Happy Hour I ordered two Avocoladas and two kids Banana and Chocolate smoothies (1/2 the size of a regular smoothie, thus two are the same size as a regular smoothie). The employee gave me a price of $19 and change, When I explained that I usually get that as 3 for the price of 2, she told me, \"You have to say, 'One Banana and Chocolate smoothie in 2 cups'\". You know, a person on top of their customer service game would take that small step for their customers, but ok, not everyone is that good, so I'll take the blame for that one. Price down to $12 and change. Cool.

After a while she hands me four smoothies through the drive through window one at a time, one with the top coming off a little. That's not to nitpick - I'm by myself, putting smoothies and straws wherever I can as she hands them to me, one in the crook of my arm, fiddling to get the lid on this other one and I'm thinking at this point a reasonable person would ask if I'd like a drink carrier (which, conveniently, holds the exact number of cups I'm negotiating). But instead she just watches me move items to stick smoothies all around my vehicle. Yeah, I could've asked for one but I didn't feel like ASKING for good customer service. Okay, I'll take partial blame on that one for being stubbornly indignant. 

The last straw: When I got home, we discover that instead of Avocoladas, she either gave us the Detox Island Green (which has no sweetener added to it) or neglected to put any sweetener in the Avocoladas. As I found out that one time I did try the Detox version (yuck), a blender and some cane sugar go a long way. 

There's doing a job, and there's doing a job well. I don't entirely blame the young lady, though. Ultimately, it's management's responsibility to address service issues (check your reviews), whether it be due to poor employee matches or overwhelmed employees. I want to love this place. Management, please take notice."}
{"text":"Not that great...Jamba juice and juice it up are so much better...u can get a better smoothie somewhere else for less money too..it wasn't pricey but wasn't worth it either...I didn't like mine, needed more to it, my bf didn't like his either, said the same. Looked pretty dirty where they were making the smoothies/food at too...never going again."}
{"text":"I seriously love coming into TSC. They make that other place (jamba juice) hang their head in shame. When I lived in Colorado and there were no TSC's in the area, I ALWAYS tried to replicate the Blimey Limey somehow at JJ and they could never make it just right.

They also offer incredible wraps and sandwiches and great meal deals so that you get a smoothie with it! The prices are great and everyone is very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This place is tasty and I enjoy the deals! Today they had any flatbread and a side for $5. I tried the Chicken Pesto, it was very tasty and loaded with pesto! A Sunrise Sunset smoothie to go with it, very tasty, but also tart (good for my taste tho) service was ok....the cashier kept interjecting as we were going back and forth with what to order, she was not even offering suggestions, but was more so interrupting....there wasn't even a line or a rush. I like that they have several good options as well as smoothies for a nice variety!"}
{"text":"I understand graveyard is tough. Especially customer service. Because i work grave AND deal with customers. But, you have to deal. Weather you have a bad day or not you have to deal. And ive had to deal with this same guy on 2 seperate occasions. Once early in the morning at the end of his shift. And once at night in the beginning of his shoft. And both times ive been given HORRIBLE service. Its really unfortunate that THIS has to be the resturant right next to my gym, and right next to my job. Getting out of the gym, need some protien or a turkey wrap and i doubt I'll come back there. As a 24 hour resturant you have a special obligation to your patrons. We need a place to satisfy the late night and early morning people. Lastly you are right next to a 24 hour gym and people who are trying to get a healthy alternative will soon go to a place thats less healthy but has better service. Like the robertos next door. 

The 24 hour smoothies and the convient location is a GREAT idea. Its just poorly executed. I will give them another chance, mostly because of necessity, and hopes they have a different employee working. But i cant suggest anyone going there during the graveyard shift.

To give and quick example. When i pull up to the mic box theres no one there to answer or greet me. He has a customer in front of me already at the window so i give him, what i felt, was the appropriate amount of time before i said hello. I received no response. I wait a little longer and then i pull up. Hes finishing with yhe customers so I hoped he seen me pull up. Or realized i was no longer at the box and looked for me. When i pull up hes no longer at the window. He has his back towards the window and is now entertaining one sole customer in the restaurant who seems to have been there for a while. I knock on the window to get his attention and he answers the window with an attitude. Making me feel as if i was insensitive to his job duties. He never once apologized for my inconvenience or made me feel justified for my wait. It was all about him and how he was too busy to press the button in his microphone and tell me to wait a moment and he appreciates my patience.

Customer service 101. And he should no longer work around people IF this is to be his attitude on several occasions mind you."}
{"text":"I've been to many locations for Tropical Smoothie and must say this is one of the worst for service. I went in and there were two ladies talking to the cashier. I waited for my turn and after a few minutes I noticed they weren't ordering anything, just chatting. Finally they moved aside and I placed my order. I paid and stood to the side to wait for my order. Over five minutes later another patron walks in and same thing she waits and finally the ladies move over to let her place an order. I am about to ask how much longer when the two ladies leave and the cashier turns around and makes our drinks!"}
{"text":"The photo is of my take out lunch today.  I ordered a California Club, which comes with chips.  The size is great for me.  As you can see, it is about the size of the small bag of chips.  The temperature was hot - not piping hot but hot enough.  (It was about 5 minutes before I unwrapped it.)  There is a lot of dressing on this pita sandwich, so be sure to eat it over something because it will drip.  
This restaurant has always been clean when I go.  I've been her a half dozen times.  The staff sometimes have trouble with the cash register and once it wasn't working at all.  But I have no complaints about the food."}
{"text":"This Tropical Smoothie Cafe is located just right off the freeway and is in a pretty good location. The parking lot is a little tight and you will need to squeeze in to park because they share the parking lot with other businesses that can be quite busy. The staff here at Tropical Smoothie are always so very friendly and patient. The take and make your order quickly and precise. They have a Huge variety of smoothies to choose from and the price is just right with the size of smoothie you decide to try. Not only do they have tasty smoothies they also have great tacos and wraps that are also good. This location has a small dining area but luckily the times I've been it hasn't been too busy enough to be uncomfortable. I definitely recommend people try Tropical Smoothie Cafe for an all right delicious and cool experience."}
{"text":"We were desperate and tried this place again. Big mistake. The smoothies were terrible. We both through them out. How is it possible that it could be messed up that badly? This place is unreal."}
{"text":"I should have known that the service was going to be horrible as soon as I walked in to a very very dim empty restaurant during lunch hour. (12-1) I've been to this same location many times and never had a bad experience and the food was tasty, but it was several months ago. I went against my instinct since there was only one car at the drive thru and the only guy was already working on their food so I figured at least it will be fast and I can eat alone in peace. Boy was I wrong! The only chubby guy there with the beard and glasses took my order which was a sweet n'smokey chicken flatbread with avocado and a cranberry truffle smoothie (which they were out of cranberries btw when it's not that late and it's the item they are currently pushing). SMH. After about 10 minutes another tall guy appears in the back wearing a flannel shirt asking about other orders and they were all wrong. By this point, another 5 min later, I'm getting impatient, but finally get my food a super bland smoothie and the WRONG food!! I go back to the counter and tell the flannel guy that happens to pass by, that it's not what I ordered and instead of helping out, let's him (chubby guy) do it. By this time he's falling behind as more cars have pulled up. Another 5 minutes go by and he comes out with my flatbread and when I ask him \"you added the avocado right?\" (This has now been a 20 min process) Chubby guy tells me yes and begins to walk away but then he takes a few steps walking back to the kitchen and realizes I'm going to eat there and he turns around and tells me \"oh you know what I didn't put avocado sorry about that\" and takes my flatbread before I can unwrap it. That's 2 times my order has been wrong and even then I say \"oh it's ok\". He comes out for a 3rd time, 10 minutes later, (now a 30 minute ordeal) and I figure ok I can still eat and make it back to work by 1pm. During this time there is also a small line of 3 people waiting and still flannel guy is not helping. I open my flatbread and there is NO CHICKEN!!  WTF!!! Just some smeared avocado some melted cheese and one bacon strip topped with a lot of spinach. I'm livid now what am I supposed to do just keep telling this moron that it's ok?? So I go to the counter again and say excuse me this is still wrong. Where is the chicken? He tells me \"oh it has chicken do you want me to remake it for you?\" \"No I want you to go heat up some chicken and just dump it on there. You've gotten my order wrong 3 times now and I'm going to be late for work and you weren't even busy when I got here!\" Two guys in line walked out after hearing the nonsense. It's now 12:40 and I walked in at 12:05, I still haven't eaten my mediocre lunch!! After he dumps the chicken on there I eat because I'm starving now and do not have the time to argue about getting my money back, but never again will I lay foot in this place. If I could give it zero stars I would. It definitely gave me a bad taste about Tropical Smoothie in general."}
{"text":"Mm mm mm mm good!!! So delicious and staff here is pretty quick on making the smoothies but a little slow on food but hey it comes out hot and tasty!  love the new deal that they are having on the $0.99 smoothies if you do the survey! Which a purchase of a wrap or sandwich! Great location love it here the acai berry boost is my favorite"}
{"text":"Most of my visits to this location leave me pleased and my hunger satiated, which is why I return. However, this early morning was not one of those times. I was profoundly disappointed in the service I had received at 2:40am, this morning of Monday, April 24th. On my way home from work, I stopped by here, as I have done many times over. A stocky man, mid 30's, provided me with mediocre service and fell short of my requests. First off, my smoothie was icy and not sweet like it normally is(and I know this because I've had it at least 50 times). I also requested extra pesto in my Chicken Pesto melt. Not only did he short me on the pesto that my melt comes with, but he charged me for extra pesto, and barely put any pesto into the \"extra\" container. I even ordered a Chipotle Chicken Club, same way, and he provided same amout of \"extra\" sauce...or lack of. I'd like to give this man the benefit of the doubt and assume he's \"new\" because I've never seen him before, but I hate this feeling of displeasure. I just deplore you all to be wary of this individual's service and do not be surprised if your expectations are not met."}
{"text":"Person wrote \"be back in 10 minutes\" on the door while this place is supposed to be open 24 hours. Sat in my car and waiting almost a half hour and the person never arrived. This is RIDICULOUS. Either you need to have better staff that can manage the store by themselves or stop being cheap and hire more people. Never going to this location again."}
{"text":"Every time I come here at night there are a ton of people and only one person working. I feel bad for that person because there's too much to do and it ends up taking 30 minutes to get a smoothie."}
{"text":"Worst wait times ever, inside and in the drive through. This location is the worst in LV. And the girl decided that she would give me a watery smoothie...? No thanks.. my island green had no flavor after being remade. Management needs to do something about the employees there ASAP"}
{"text":"Legit sat in the drive thru for 15 minutes and no one took my order. I ended up backing out because the person in front of me was stuck at the window for the same amount of time. I don't know why i keep coming here. It's the only Tropical Smoothie that takes forever to make one drink. Need to find a new smoothie spot."}
{"text":"Very disappointed way over priced. Service stinks. Dirty .. always get the order wrong. The workers dont know what there doing and dont seem to care. Even there hours are not consistent they close and open when they want.stopped going there. After six times un a row of problems."}
{"text":"Just okay for Tropical Smoothie, but when you're in the Excalibur and looking for something quick, you're left with fast food choices.  This location is upstairs with the rest of their fast food restaurants.  I am a fan of the Tropical Smoothie chain.  My order is the same almost everytime...their Pesto Chicken Flatbread.  Service at this location is not bad, especially since most people up here are hitting up the McDonalds or Krispy Kremes.

One plus...they are either open 24 hours or stay open really late.  I've been here after midnight and they are still open."}
{"text":"First of all, this review is not for the smoothies.  The review is for the food. 

I'm at Red Rock at least once a week during the NFL season.  There are plenty times when I'm starving and want something quick that isn't their buffet, cafe, or restaurants.  So, where do I go?  The food court of course and this time Tropical Smoothie.

My first visit at Tropical Smoothie was a couple of months ago.  Reviewed the menu and saw that at least the pictures looked good. I settled for the $3.99 Chicken Pesto in flatbread. Since their smoothies are a bit pricey, I assumed that the Chicken Pesto was small. So, I ordered 2.  The Chicken Pesto was really good.  Melted cheese, just the right amount of pesto, and thick pieces of chicken. All in a heated thick piece of flatbread. To my surprise, each Chicken Pesto was pretty big too.  I was almost full after devouring one.  Still had one more to go and my mom didn't raise a quitter, so I ate the other.  Since my first visit, I've been here about 5 more times and when it comes to service, they have it right. Scary that they even know me by name and have my order started before I make it to check out.  

Move over Rubio's and Fatburger, I think I found my new go to food court item while I'm at Red Rock. I can't wait to try the other sandwiches."}
{"text":"Definitely the worst tropical smoothie I have ever been to. I have never been through the drive though shorter than at least half an hour. The biggest problem is that they are ALWAYS understaffed. The poor guy that works at about 11pm most nights is the only person there, and seems to constantly be dealing with really angry customers because it takes so long for their food to be made. Management is a joke for doing that to that staff member and themselves. Don't bother coming here, when there are so many other smoothie options in the area (since located next to LVAC) that will crush any tropical smoothie recipe."}
{"text":"I love their smoothies, unfortunately their service is so slow. It's the slowest drive-thru I've been to. I am always upset when waiting, if their smoothies weren't so good I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"The guy here is rocking it solo while lots of people start coming in. He asks how everybody's morning is going as well as cranking out orders. Impressed! 12/1/17

6/8/18 different guy is doing his best, but this place needs MINIMUM 2 people for the am crew. There are 5+ people who are waiting for their food to get ready. He hooked it up with a discount for the inconvenience but you guys could make so much more with adequate staff during busy hours."}
{"text":"I love Tropical Smoothie, but this location is terrible. I had to wait 11 minutes in the drive through (I timed it) and I couldn't leave because there was someone in front and behind me. The staff seems nice, but the service is slow and their orders are inaccurate."}
{"text":"It's a Saturday around lunchtime and I've waited 30 min for a smoothie and sandwich. The girl said there were only two and then there were three of them. You think they'd have more staff"}
{"text":"Decent prices but such rude service. Wouldn't use stevia (that I brought) or substitute spinach for bananas without a charge. Yes I'm a pregnant pain in the ass but at least I'm nice about it. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to this new location. They take forever for your smoothie. I don't think that should happen if I'm the only person in the drive-thru"}
{"text":"So I've been coming in the mornings to get my Avocolada smoothie at this location because Keyonna and Kyree know how to make them perfect!!! Their customer service is always on point with smiles And they get me out of there quick. The store is always clean when I go in so that's a plus because I know they get busy. If you want your smoothie done right check out this location!"}
{"text":"I really love tropical smoothie and I love that this one is by my house to always satisfy a craving. I've never had any issues or complaints until now. Precious was my cashier and she was completely monotone and doesn't even say hello. I know it's just a fast food/drink place and I'm not expecting fine dining service but a \"hello\" or a smile maybe even a \"thank you\" would have been nice. My total was 12.06 and when I gave her a 20 she asked in her monotone voice \"do you have 6 cents\" if I had 6 cents handy I would have given it to her. Hopefully next time I return my experience will be with someone who doesn't completely show that they hate their job."}
{"text":"Let me just start off by saying I love tropical smoothie I think their smoothies are delicious and I love their food. My only problem at this location is the staff... The staff here is rude and pay no attention to their customers. I'm not sure if they're having plumbing issues but when I  came here today the back of room smelled like sewer. Lastly, they took forever to make my order (probably because there were only 2 people working). I am very disappointed with my visit today."}
{"text":"The only reason this doesn't just get one star is because my smoothies always end up okay. It's the service that is the strangest thing on the planet.

I don't think I have ever had more employees look at us without acknowleding me than at this place. Other places, they at least look like they were too busy to notice us. This place, THREE different employees looked at us, then looked at each other, all in some silent hot potato game to decide who was going to take an order. Mind you, there is no other customer in this place.

When we did get to order, our server just mumbled to us. Not a hello or anything. My fiancee had a coupon for a free smoothie since it was her birthday and I ordered one too. We didn't have to pay. I have no idea why. I guess the employee comped us two drinks instead of one. He didn't even take her coupon. It was nice but I actually wanted to pay for my smoothie. Yes, I had money in hand to do it and I couldn't. I just went ahead and tipped for it. 

He didn't say anything to us after he mumbled our orders.

But hey, POSITIVES!

Both smoothies were great and we got them for free for whatever reason. 

So who knows! Come to this location and maybe the employee's apathy towards your smoothie needs might result in you getting something for free."}
{"text":"I came here at 7pm there was no one here and the place was dirty. Then I ordered two buffalo wraps and both didn't even look like wraps but super fat chipotle size burritos then I went home took my first bite and they were nowhere near a buffalo wrap the guy put inside lettuce with bunch of spicy Italian sauce or something and there was no buffalo sauce inside at all. Went back to get a refund and returned the food and he tells me he can't give refunds I ask to speak to manager he said he's not here and he will have to call. Well he called and no one picked up of course then I gave him a shot of making it again but this time hopefully look like wrap and this is what I get view the pics bellow . Horrible service and this place should be shut down or the person working the night shift should not be working there or someone should seriously train him! I have been in the FB business for a long time and by my standard this place is bad and if a health inspector comes in and rates it I bet they won't pass with the amount of trash and dirt there is on the floors. So sad because this place is supposed to be clean being in a really nice area like Summerlin. Shame"}
{"text":"The smoothies here are absolutely delicious. 
The service is always fast and the employees have all been friendly. I will go here over Jamba Juice any day since you get a way bigger smoothie for the price and have many more options. 
Only complaint is that I wish they had more locations!"}
{"text":"I'm not gonna waste another minute of my life on this location with a drawn out review. 
  I've gone twice and both visits they've messed up my order. How hard is No Onions? Apparently it's very difficult. 
  I will say both visits my totally green smoothie was awesome and the staff is incredibly friendly but get with it... There's nothing worse than getting home and finding your order is wrong and now you have to drive back.."}
{"text":"I spent 20 minutes in line waiting for ONE smoothie and a wrap. There was no one inside the restaurant so why it took that long is ridiculous. They need to get it together or at least inform their customers it could be upwards of 20 minutes to receive their items."}
{"text":"Ordered an avocado smoothie and 2 half a salads. First off, the customer service was great. My smoothie came out very good and I'm pleased with it. 

The only downfall was the two side salads we ordered. It was made from white weak looking iceberg salad. I had to pick out old lettuce from the salad about a quarter cup of old lettuce. There was quarter size amount of tomato and two SMALL pieces of chicken. I was not very happy with that. I appreciate if the salad was checked before serving to the customer."}
{"text":"anyone that has been to more than one Tropical Smoothie Cafe knows that there are good locations and bad locations (as in, they cant make good smoothie-the staple of the establishment). this happens to be the best of all the locations ive been to.

no mater what smoothie i order, it is always good and consistent. i can come in any any day of the week, whether its busy of slow in there, and my smoothie is tasty. i usually get the health nut with whey, but im known to get a peanut paradise or a sunrise sunset from time to time and they are just right every time and never watery tasting or off.

they also have food, people. food that is also really good and on the \"healthy\" side. wraps, sandwiches, salads. my favorite wraps are the jamaican jerk chicken or the popeye's favorite. i get the ultimate club sandwich a lot and its really good. salads...i dont mess around with them but im sure theyre good. 

anyone that lives in that area, horizon and horizon, should stop by. definitely buy one of the tropical smoothie reusable cups and save a styrofoam cup from going into the environment."}
{"text":"Smoothies are always good but if you get a quesadilla just know there's a 0% chance the cheese will actually be melted. 
I'm pretty sure this is the easiest item to make on their menu yet every time I get one I have to have them remake it. It's disgusting. 
I'm done coming back now after today


*also every time I went in to have them remake it, I've never been greeted or apologized to. I walk in and it's like I'm not even there. Maybe if they don't say anything I'll disappear??"}
{"text":"This place is so slow, I can understand why no one comes here and it's always flippin empty. These girls can't move to save their life, 20 minutes for a smoothie and there's me and one other person in here. Screw this place."}
{"text":"Wow!!! Absolute crap service!!!  Just went through the drive thru waited 10 mins and was on Yelp writing a review. I get the WRONG ORDER AGAIN!!!! This is the last time I come back here. I've already spoke to the new owner about their service. I come back around the drive thru a man starts speaking in the microphone and I explain I'm upset about the service and how they continue to mess up our order when I order CLEARLY and the girl jumps on and says \"Well I read the order back to you!\" I replied \"Wow!  This is your guys problem. You're rude. You don't apologize!  What is your name because I was on Yelp writing a review about the wait and now I want to contact the owner about your attitude!\" She laughed and replied \"TAYLOR! PULL FORWARD!!!\"  So rude and disrespectful!!!!  I will never spend another PENNY ON THIS PLACE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service.. very unfriendly staff and they don't serve certain smoothies that other tropical smoothy locations do."}
{"text":"Smoothie was ok, the staff was friendly and attentive at the counter, but all the tables definitely needed a wipe down as they were all covered in sticky smoothie and crumbs."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this location. The food is good and so are the smoothies. However, the employees are a different story. Heather is a terrible employee. She was frantic and messed up two of our orders. When we let her know she told me I was wrong. Also, she cursed under he breath while taking care of a customer in the drive thru. I am a frequent customer and she has made me rethink coming back. Also, stop talking to your friends when you are working."}
{"text":"I get an hour for lunch, I don't understand why it takes my whole lunch break to order and receive my food. Because I had no time to eat my food, I took it back to work to eat at my desk, and what do I find?! A piece of hair in my carrots (I ordered a thai chicken salad). 
I instantly threw it away in disgust, alongside any want or craving or respect for this place."}
{"text":"We have been going to this location for about two years now. The past year it has been not as pleasant. We kept giving it a try, but today we got 3 smoothies all different flavors, 2 chicken pestos and a kids turkey and cheddar. The cheese in the pestos and wrap were not melted at all and the chicken was cold. The smoothies were watered down and had no true flavor to them. It was really disappointing!"}
{"text":"Good food... Crappy customer service!! We have frequented this place quite often in the past. Great tasting food and awesome smoothies. Sadly this time will be our last. Waited over 45 minutes for 2 chicken wraps and 1 smoothie!! We were about to cancel our order when the food finally came out. And we even told the cashier as she brought it we were just about to cancel. She laughed a bit and walked away. Not even an \"I'm sorry about that.\" Oh and to top it off she didn't bring my side of orange until I was already halfway done eating...would not recommend!!"}
{"text":"I really like their smoothies and wraps HOWEVER, the wait is too long. How are there 3 employees and 2 customers including myself and I still had to wait 15 minutes for a smoothie and a wrap WHICH BY THE WAY THEY GOT WRONG. I didn't even bother asking for a new one because I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Hhhjjjhhh"}
{"text":"The food and smoothies aren't bad, but the service is awful. How does it take 9 minutes (seriously, I timed this) to make a smoothie and sandwich when I'm the only person in the place and there are three people working?

The smoothies are expensive when ordered by themselves, but a pretty good value at $3 if added to a sandwich. The \"Get Up and Goji\" is my favourite. Be warned, however, that all their smoothies are FILLED with sugar by default, with some having 600+ calories! Order with no sugar for a healthier option: they're still plenty tasty.

The food is okay but rather uninspired. The menu looks fairly broad, but it really boils down to chicken or beef, with different bread and sauce. They often put too much sauce or no sauce at all, but almost never the right amount...

If you're just looking for a mediocre fast food lunch with an okay smoothie thrown in, and have time to spare, Tropical Smoothie Cafe is a passable option, but there's lots of better choices."}
{"text":"I came here one morning after driving by the night before, receiving a coupon flier in the mail that day, and seeing a commercial later that night.  I took it as a sign.  Plus, they were advertising a new limited edition smoothie.  The Avocolada.  That is a smoothie with avocada, kale, coconut and pine apple.  It sounded pretty good aside from the kale.  But there is enough other stuff to hide that, right.  And the avocado should make for an ultra creamy smoothie.  The coconut will provide a good shot of sweetness.  The pine apple will off set that with a bit of acidity.  This is going to be great, I think to myself.

Well, the first thing I notice when I walk in the door at Tropical Smoothie is the total lack of anybody manning the cash register.  The sign said open but there did not seem to be anybody there.  After several minutes I caught the attention of a line cook in the back.  He got the cashier up to the front.  Meanwhile I notice that the place smells funky. I don't know like what. The place didn't look dirty so I decided to stay.  Besides, I needed breakfast. I was already running behind and did not want to try to find somewhere else.  After a few minutes of watching my smoothie made I was on the road with a smoothie in tow.  

I waited until I was in the car to try out this new Avocolada concoction.  The first sip led to instant straw colapse.  I've had thinner milk shakes.  It was almost impossible to drink.  I actually got so much suction the straw stuck to my lip.  I felt like I had a fat lip for about the next hour.  It was still colapsing straws two hours later.  Crazy.  And it did not taste anything like what I expected.  I was hard pressed to find the coconut and pine apple. I could pick up hints of the avocado but mostly it was the kale that I noticed.  It took me a while to pick out what was off about this.  All I could say is that it tasted green.  Like under ripe strawberries or the leafy top of the same.  Finally, I realized I was reminded of the chlorophyll I used to take.  That could only be one thing.  Kale.

I took a chance and was let down.  They have other smoothies that sound like they would be better than the Avocolada.  If they are and this place in particular can improve their service it may be alright.  For now I'll stick to what I know for my smoothie fix, Jamba Juice."}
{"text":"Well this location happens to be right by LVAC and stays open 24 hours a day. So even though it was almost 9 pm the drive thru took almost 15 minutes to get thru and get our order. That being said it's nice to know there's an alternative to McDonald's when your heading home after a late night out at the club or casino. 

I tried the Chicken Cesar wrap and a protien shake. Both were about what I expected. I had a Mango flavored smoothie with protien. I'd of prefered maybe an option for a smaller portion because these drinks can have so many calories, but it was Tasty! The wrap was a tad bit on the warm side. I prefer a wrap like this be cold and crisp but it was almost hot. I'm guessing possibly because they had just cooked the chicken? But either way, it was good and I'll probably order it again next time."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a tasty smoothie, this might be a good option if you don't mind syrups and sherbet style smoothies. I do believe they add some frozen fruit, however I noticed they use some syrups, juices and sherbets, as well. I prefer fresh or frozen fruit and maybe ice and almond milk, Tropical  Smoothie seems to be more sugar heavy. For just under $5 you get a pretty big smoothie, like 24 oz I believe.  
The place is clean, service friendly, and I like that they donate to children's charity."}
{"text":"I usually have a great experience here, but the same day my co worker and we're talking about food workers and hair nets, I received the longest hair in my Thai Chicken wrap sandwich. I was day too busy that day to return so I threw it out without taking a pic unfortunately. Maybe bedtime I'll have a better experience."}
{"text":"I don't know if my order is too complex, but they seem to get at least one of the three things wrong every time, and its different errors each time....they are cheap and fast and right by my work which is probably the only reason I go back..."}
{"text":"I was craving a smoothie from here. I walked in at 11:25 and it was like a Sauna in Tropical Smoothie Cafe. I ordered my smoothie and informed the employee \"that it was cooler outside then in here and it was to hot to breath in here!\" The employee informed me that the owners family member turned off the A/C because she was cold!!  I waited for my drink outside and when I received my Sunrise Sunset smoothie it was very very tart. I had to go back inside the steam room and request for my drink to be made again. Should have walked the extra 100ft and went to McDonald's for a smoothie. Very disappointed in my experience today."}
{"text":"I'm starting with positives. The smoothies were spot on, the service was great kieara was a sweet sweet girl.  Now for the negatives as i wish there wasn't any there really is. I ordered a veggie hummus wrap. Well there was chicken in my wrap. I bit into it and welp let's just say  I'm less then pleased. There was little to no hummus no smashed avocado, no kale, spinach and very little lettuce no asparagus. The rice was left out and she did ask if that was ok on the side but there was less then a scoop of rice. Everything I had listened is listed in the menu!  I hate meat it's my least favorite thing ever. I'm pissed. I will not take the time to drive back tonight I am too uoset.  although I will be going back tomorrow with what was ordered and get my money back. Let's say I'll never absolutely never eat here again.  I got my boyfriend that was also ALL wrong. Let's sat I am more than disappointed. I might go for a smoothie again only if nektar isn't open. Never again. Thanks I'll pass.

I do want to update this. I contacted the store after this by phone. The manager didn't make me come back to get it corrected being I didn't want the food anymore and put back the money on my card. He didnt have to refund me. But he listened to my complaint and took care of me how a manager should. So grear work there. I've been back many times since I'll never eat the food again but they have made me some amazing smoothies!"}
{"text":"Miranda, was the cashier that helped my family an I, she was extremely rude didn't acknowledge us after we said hi to her. She didn't smile nor made us feel welcomed.  She needs to smile and not look so depressed. Not coming back here."}
{"text":"Was one of 2 customers in line to order and waited over for 10 minutes just to order a smoothie while the employees dicked around and did nothing. After placing my order it took another 10 minutes to get ONE SMOOTHIE. I could've literally made myself 20 of these bastards myself in the time it took them to make one. Awful service. 0/10 would not recommend."}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer at Tropical  Smoothie not only for their amazing smoothies but because they support Camp Sunshine in Maine where I have been many times when my child was battling cancer. However, this Sunday I was so disappointed in the three flat bread sandwiches I received. I ordered 2 steak tzaziki flat breads and one chicken chipolte flat bread. Unfortunately, the steak flat breads where loaded with purple onions.  Overwhelmingly loaded!! The steak was chewy and at times I could not manage to swallow the steak due to it's texture. My boyfriend had the same complaints with his steak  tzaziki flat bread. The chicken flat bread was absent the chicken!!  

We took our order home so we didn't have the luxury of resolving this issue immediately. However, I did call and spoke to a young lady (Bianca) who was very pleasant and insisted that only one tablespoon of onions is used in each flat bread and I insisted that there was definitely more than one tablespoon. She than proceeded to tell me that next time I should order it without onions... Really???? I enjoy steak with onions but not onions with steak! 

My smoothies were on point... As usual. However, the flat breads were beyond edible. I thinkTropical Smoothie should stick with what they know &/ provide better training in sandwich making and customer complaints."}
{"text":"Love their food but the guy working the register had no clue what he was doing or what was offered on the menu. They took FOREVER to give my order and there was just 3 others waiting to get food. This place needs better management from the looks of it!"}
{"text":"I wish this location of tropical smoothie could do a little bit better. Every time I give this place another chance, I find myself waiting in the drive-through for almost 15 to 20 minutes just for a smoothie. Only good thing I can say is that the smoothies are good!"}
{"text":"The worst tropical smoothie, every time I come here the employees are joking around and acting like they don't care. The drive thru menu was destroyed and unreadable to I had to order from the window. Then i paid $6 for a like a chump!  Not going back here.

I went back... like an idiot... and they said \"cash only\" in drive thru so I left. 

Seriously what is up with this place, no way they are making money."}
{"text":"Best smoothie restaurant in La Vegas. I always drink Sunshine smoothie and here they make it the best. Every time I go there it taste excellent. All the sandwiches and wraps are so delicious and healthy. Can you ask for more"}
{"text":"I love this location! I'll start with the downfall because it is only one thing... They take a long time most of the time. Given I am always at least ordering two smoothies and something to eat. They are very friendly with making accommodations. If you have ever made smoothies at home you know it cannot be done in 5 minutes. Make sure to tip them accordingly, especially with big orders and customized orders... Every bit helps. 

Sunday is free supplement day so you can try a new one every time! 

I just tried their meatless beyond meat and it is good! They can customize most tacos and flat breads... 

Great brand and favorite location! I get the same guy every time and he is a doll! :)"}
{"text":"Worst one I have been to.  Take forever, don't blend the smoothies all the way and basically on three occasions made me regret the journey. It's worth going farther to the next one."}
{"text":"I was waiting in line to order next, nobody was behind me. The employee taking an order was having a conversation with the customer for several minutes knowing I was just standing there. I don't mind if you're having a chit chat, but can't the person could've taken my order first (30 seconds) and then continue on with their conversation afterwards? 2 stars for the delicious smoothie. Horrible customer service."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I come here often. Over the past 6 months they have come to be a horrible place. They have run out of chicken and peanut butter on not one or even two times but multiple times. The owner obviously cares less about the location. The staff is constantly turning over, I have not seen the same person twice. (We go here at least once a week) I've had some pretty bad experiences here including long wait times. I suggest spending you money else where."}
{"text":"Ok so let me tell u about my experience just stopping in to pick up a few gifts cards after waiting for over 5mins of waiting for someone to see what I would like to order, I told them what I wanted and first of all they did NOT know where the gift cards where. Helloooooo someone that does not work there needs to tell these guys where there gift cards are. Then they did not have enough and to top it off they did not know how to put them amount I requested on the cards. The first guy had NO clue and the other guy tried to do it then told me that they were NOT allowed to sell the cards all bc these two guys could not put the correct amount on these gift cards. So for thst they are out $100.00. really people come on. Moving on to something else will NOT be back to this location."}
{"text":"Did you know that Island Green smoothie is actually delicious? Just look at these ingredients: Pineapple (amazing), mango & banana (mmm banana), kale, spinach (personally I don't like anything green but this is healthy and delicious)... See? Smoothies are basically just blended salads.

- Please note that smoothies are made with turbinado. You can request Splenda instead.
- Classic Smoothies: Made with non-fat yogurt /low fat.
- Superfood Smoothies: Made with fresh fruits & veggies.
- Supercharged Smoothies:Made with supplements additions.
- Indulgent Smoothies: You name it: Peanut butter, chocolate, coconut, coffee & cappuccino.
- Also, they serve food. Such as Caribbean Jerk Wrap/ bowl. In addition to wraps, sandwiches, flatbreads and more.

Everyone is nice,
All the food is made so good as well!"}

{"text":"One star seems like way too much. Who ever runs this store should be fired for only having one person on the clock. I've been in the drive thru for over 30 min. When I finally got to the window the poor guy has a line out the door."}
{"text":"Very, Very disappointed with my experience here, went there a few days ago on Saturday really anticipating a smoothie, went to the drive thru and there was a handwritten note that said drive thru not working need to come into the store. There was no one in line, so we went directly to the counter, where we waited, and waited, and waited. No one greeted us, nothing so I began to look around, there was probably 10 people at different tables, not a single person had a smoothie, drink, food, anything, continued to wait and finally gave up and left. Went back last night because we still wanted a smoothie, went inside and I got excited no customers and I saw people behind the counter. As we got closer I realized these \"people\" were children all probably under the age of 12. A little girl hopped up on the stool in front of the register and asked what we wanted, I was so confused, finally an older girl in a uniform went over to the register near the window and began to yell over the loud music that was blasting what we wanted, as we began to yell back in an effort to order, everything we asked for they were out of, ginger, blueberries, cucumbers, bananas, I was so angry!! I left again!!! Twice in 3 days!! And I have tried calling the store to speak with a manager, no one even answers the phone."}
{"text":"They seriously have staffing issues. Every time I come into this place there is only one person behind the counter and 15 people in the store waiting. It's sad because the people working are real nice but you can't help to get super frustrated waiting 15 minutes at the counter just to put in an order and then another 30 minutes just to get what you ordered. Put more people on staff. Please!"}

{"text":"Great smoothies.  Just wish they had their happy hour back of buy one get one free so we could afford it more often. It s so healthy!"}
{"text":"Last time I come to this location. Quality of customer service is poor. First visit I waited a long time to receive smoothie and my special request was forgotten. So I refrained from coming for awhile and visited other locations. Today I decided to give another chance to this location. I get to the window and had to make a slight correction to my smoothie. I waited 5-8 min for a cashier to come to the window. I asked if it was too late to make a correction to my order. She replied yes because my smoothie was made before I had the chance to purchase. I thought it wouldn't be a problem to make a correction because there was no one else in the drive-through. I paid for my drink and drove off unhappy. Needless to say I won't return to this location"}
{"text":"This location used to be good the first few times I came here, now there's different workers and their smoothies always taste like water. They put 8-10 pumps in each smoothie as if the fruit is only being used to color the smoothie, then there's still a blender full, after they empty it into your cup... This is especially annoying when you pay to add protein to ur smoothies or other add ins bc you know you're not getting all that you paid for bc some is still in the blender ((which I didn't order add ins this time, but it happened last time when I came in with my boyfriend, so bad to the point we turned around and went back inside to have them remake the smoothies)) Anyways, I normally wouldn't write a review, seeing how I already had one horrible experience and didn't, but today I went in and had headphones in, I took them out to order, when I was handed my change I didn't double count it or even really look at it (bad habit I guess), but I sat down and continued listening to music but very quietly, then could hear the workers talking about me about while I'm sitting right in front of them, talking about how they could have handed me the wrong change and I woulda never known and not to trust everyone, etc etc in an extremely rude tone. It was so unprofessional and disrespectful I had to write a review. This location has officially lost my business, I'll never be returning, possibly to any tropical smoothie at this point."}
{"text":"I give this location 0 stars!  I ordered the Tropical Chicken Sandwich and all I got was the jerk mayo with lettuce.  It was my first time in and I won't be returning.  I feel the Franchise owner should check his employees work ethic a little closer.  I was also rung up as a drive thru customer when in fact I went into the store.  $8.65 for a spicey mayo sandwich  :("}
{"text":"Service is a little slow, but the staff were friendly, and the smiles genuine. I like that they give you a choice of sugar or Splenda in their smoothies too!"}
{"text":"I was very happy with the smoothie I ordered.  I opted for Splenda instead of turbinado sugar.  It tasted great.  The staff was very friendly.  It's a quick walk from The Hard Rock."}
{"text":"Cute decor & convenient location. The staff here have ZERO customer service skills & look the unhappiest to be working here. The place/vibe feels miserable right along with the employees. No \"hi\", smile, or apology for the messed up order. Luckily for them it's a branded company otherwise they would be out of business. Even the manager has no people skills."}
{"text":"This location is terrible. I have been to multiple tropical smoothie cafés in the past and always get King Ceasar wrap, which is usually amazing. It tasted nothing like the norm here, was much smaller and didn't even include the pickles on the side.

Don't bother coming here."}
{"text":"The smoothies are really good. The dining room is so tiny and cramped that you can't comfortably eat here. It feels like you're sitting right next to the staff and there's no privacy. I wasn't a huge fan of my wrap."}
{"text":"Love the smoothies here! They have extended hours which is nice and the smoothie flavors are a nice change from typical citrus flavors."}
{"text":"Every time we went here there was one person working, and they never got our order correct or it tasted AAAWWWFUL!!! Then, on the morning around 9:15am on May 13th 2018, it was supposed to open at 8am, we go and they were closed with I think a note supposed to be there but it wasn't taped properly..so my husband gets back in his truck and see's a woman with a cart full of stuff from the Albertson's across the parking lot, talking on her phone and threatening someones life on it, who worked at the tropical smoothie!!!! WTF IS GOING ON THERE?! Never had an issue at the Horizon and Horizon Ridge place..they at least knew how to make the smoothies. NEVER GOING BACK THERE."}
{"text":"Worst location I've ever been to. I come into town frequently and always try giving them a second chance. They have never once answered the phone for me to place a to-go order. The employees ignore you when you come in. Don't even greet you when they give you your smoothie. This is a horrible excuse for a business. Nothing has improved or changed in the past 2/3 years of me going here. Would never recommend. Employees hang outside and smoke cigarettes or sit on phones in the back. It takes a lot for me to take time out of my day and make a Yelp review, so this says something for sure. Advice to the owner: Please fire all your employees and re-think how you're doing things because this is bad.."}
{"text":"It seems I'm not the only one who has experienced such bad customer service here. In my most recent trip, I first noticed the shining C health grade they got, which probably should have been my red flag to turn around and leave. But I stayed anyway out of desperation. After a couple people in line before me ordered their drinks, the guy at the register said he'd be with me in a minute. Fine. I watch him go to the back and start chopping a watermelon in half, no gloves, and saw one half of it falling into the fridge. Good thing I didn't want anything with watermelon in it. Eight minutes later, still no one has acknowledged that I've been standing there, with at least four people in line behind me now. A girl finally came to the register after she finished preparing some food item, then took my order. I showed her my Flip Flip key fob that is good for 10% off the order, but she still charged me the normal price (I know I would have only saved some change, but still..). I waited another ten minutes for my smoothie to be made, and as usual, it tasted like water. I should have known to expect that, since literally everything I order from this location only tastes like water. So basically, I keep coming to this location despite its horrible customer service, the wait time it takes for my smoothie to be made, and its lack of flavor. But the health grade being a C has made me decide enough was enough. Last night, my boyfriend and I went to the location on Horizon and WOW what a difference. It was clean, the staff was friendly, our order was made promptly, and there was actual flavor in our smoothies. All this time, I never knew how it was really supposed to taste, and now that I do know, I'm never going back to this Stephanie location."}
{"text":"Good luck getting acknowledged. Just stood by the register for 10-15 minutes waiting to place an order. The girls were busy doing whatever they were doing. So much so that while they saw me, they weren't able to even blurt out a simple hello. 

There's plenty of other places to get something to drink. Try those places before you try this place."}
{"text":"Buy 2 get 1 free smoothies 4-7! Had no clue, came to get 2 smoothies ended up walking out with another... It was hard making up my mind between 2 different smoothies, but ended up getting both anyways."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! I waited in line for 5 minutes without anyone acknowledging me or the other people in line. The counter was filthy and they had trash all over the ground behind the counter (see photo). 

If I didn't order online and had paid already, I would have left."}
{"text":"Super slow service. It took ten minutes to take my order and no one is front of me.  45 minutes later I received the ONE smoothie I ordered.  Staff is super friendly, but seemingly disorganized."}
{"text":"The smoothies are ok. The real problem is a few of the teens working here. Rude and not interested in working or helping customers. Real easy solution for the owner of this location considering how many people needs jobs..."}
{"text":"I love this location bc it's 24/7 & they have friendly staff. But the last 2 times that I have ordered a salad, they have forgotten to put the dressing in my to go bag. You'd think I'd learn to check the bag before I drive off after the first time, but nope. Both times I've driven all the way home before noticing. When I brought this to their attention the 2nd time, the employee simply said \"I'm sorry\" & provided us with the dressing as if that suffices the drive back & forth. Bottom line: check to make sure you have everything before driving off!"}
{"text":"Meh. The staff was friendly, the smoothie was ok. The issue I had was it smelled funny in the restaurant. So bad that I couldn't WAIT to get out of there. Not sure I'd make a point to returning but if I needed a cool beverage on a hot day, I'd try it again."}
{"text":"Great smoothies, Great location I would recommend to my friends and family.  Recharging with an Avacolada  smoothies is making my Sunday."}
{"text":"Worst Tropical smoothie, ever! The worker said if I get one more order (mind you I am about to order) she was going to walk out... They didn't even have change to give back to me for a 10 dollar bill...."}
{"text":"I love coming here for a delicious smoothie and the hummus veggie wrap. It's a bit pricey but I get a delicious meal and a big smoothie. The wrap is 6.99 and it comes with a side of fruit or chips. The green detox smoothie is 4.99 and it's pretty big. The total comes out to  $11.59 but I don't feel bad afterward you know? 

The actual restaurant itself can use some love. The bathroom isn't the cleanest nor is the restaurant area either. The floors always look like they haven't been given a good sweep in a while and the chairs are always askew. The AWESOME thing though is if you're feeling a smoothie at 3 am, they're open. Just try finding anything around this area (other than Walmart & fast stations) where you can find a delicious healthy meal at 3 am. :-) 

I Don't mind the bit of mess as long as I don't find any hair in my food or smoothie."}
{"text":"The worst Tropical Smoothie. They never answer the phone and are super rude when they do. Seems like a bunch of rude kids that don't appreciate a job. Tried to stop in the store before they closed and they refused to make a drink because they were closing in like 30 minutes. I have never gone somewhere where they refused service because they didn't want to clean an extra blender. To the managers of this place, I would reconsider who you are hiring if they are so lazy they refuse money... super disappointing. This place had great potential being in a location where they were the only nearby smoothie place, but from my experience and the ratings prior, maybe they should close their doors and someone should open something more similar to a Protein House."}
{"text":"This is the slowest Tropical Smoothie I've ever been to. I waited over 20 minuets for a smoothie and it cut into my short lunch break. I'm surprised that they have a drive-thru for being so slow."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot , but recently I've stopped coming as much due to the fact that I'm always in the drive thru for a minimum of 30 mins. Today I've decided to give them another chance again . I've been in the drive thru for 26 minutes now and I have yet to order ."}
{"text":"I love TroSmo, and I love that this location is open 24hrs. They have a wide selection of healthy to decadent smoothies (greens, fruits, chocolate, peanut butter, etc) and the food options are decent too. You can have from their breakfast menu all day, and as a breakfast nut who craves eggs and bacon at odd times, I appreciate that. Their quality of smoothies also far exceeds their competition. 
I've been to Tropical Smoothie locations across the valley and experienced the same general wait time at all of them. It's seldom quick but worth the wait. No shame there- they make most of their items fresh. But this location takes \"wait\" to a whole new level. It is painstakingly slow. Something is definitely wrong with the staffing here, and that is a darn shame. If you are in even the slightest rush, avoid at all costs- especially the drive thru!"}
{"text":"Service: Great 
Food: Good 
Restaurant: Clean & Tropical
Restroom: Clean
Return Visits: Yes, as soon as I complete this review :)
Favorites: Peaches and Silk, Cordon Bleu Toasted Wrap

I love this location. It's 24 hours, there is more than 3 tables unlike some other locations, outside seating-- tables are like little tiki huts, very tropical! Also, being across an LVAC is a huge plus :)

This was the first time that I tried the food and I was pretty impressed!  As I said when I was eating, \"MmMm, It's surprisingly good!\" as I was nodding my head. I really didn't expect it to be so good.

NOTE: 4pm to 7pm 2-for-1 Smoothies"}
{"text":"Will NEVER go back to this location or any if the locations by this franchise owner. The girls forgot our order while we waited almost 40 minutes for our food. 
Customer service can be greatly improved and also the level of professionalism amongst the young teens working there. 
Pick up the pace, be aware, and stop texting, and actually smile!"}
{"text":"The young man who took my order through the drive-thru was extremely frustrating. He sounded like he didn't care, he knew almost nothing about the menu and when I asked for a specific sandwich he said they \"might\" not have it. So I asked \"so, do you have it or don't you?\" He replied again \"we might not have it.\" Really, so I just ordered another type of sandwich.  I am extremely patient and understanding but you should probably know about the products you are getting paid for to sell.  And for corporate, if you are going to have something on your menu, please ensure that it is available for your customers, and if it is not available please ensure you are communicating this to your customers, this isn't rocket science.

I have decided to edit my response because of the professionalism of the owner of this establishment. She was kind, understanding, and genuinely wanted to ensure my next experience is better. Thank you for reaching back out to me and taking ownership of this situation."}
{"text":"Sat in the drive thru waiting and never got serviced :) also every single time I come here the staff has NEVER been friendly, I've waited 30 mins for my smoothie a couple times (when they weren't busy)"}
{"text":"Got the cilantro lime fish tacos and they were bomb. Smoothies are good too. Decent prices and they're open 24 hours."}
{"text":"So my lady suggest that we try something new, I am tired of the burger n Fry's joints so she wanted to try this place called tropical cafe. Not gunna lie I was not feeling this place when she told me about this place. But I said what the hell. Let's do it. I struggle with making a decision on getting a flat bread meal or try their there new CHI BANANA smoothie. The two lady's that were working the nightshift said that was there best smoothie. So I got one and man let me tell you its the best damn smoothie I have ever had \" expect to see more n more, I have to try everything on the menu Adrianna and makala you guys rock keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Wow I am so disappointed. I love this place and normally go after every workout. The last time I was here I was treated so rudely. I drove up to the ordering window, and the car in front of me took 10 mins to order, I finally
Move up, wait another 5 mins and then finally asked if anyone was there. The employee working VERY rudely replied that she will be there in a minute, so I waited another 5 mins before giving up and driving to the window. Then the girl working, saw me pull up, blatantly shut the window and walked away rolling her eyes. I sat there and waited for 10 more minutes hoping to order. Every time she walked past the window with a dirty look towards me and refused to come give me service. I have never been treated like this at a drive through and it was shocking. I didn't take the time out of my day to complain to managers but I hope they will read this. The very rude employee who was working the drive through had very short brown hair and a bad attitude. I hope she will be fired for treating regular customers with such disrespect!"}
{"text":"It took over 10 minutes to get my order, management needs to find a way to staff properly or change their process. Extremely slow service."}
{"text":"We pulled this place up on Yelp since it was right down the street from where we were staying (Alexis Park). I ordered a Beach Bum smoothie and a chicken apple sandwich of some sort, the name escapes me and I don't have a menu to look at. The beach bum smoothie was delicious as was the sandwich. My fiance's enjoyed his mango smoothie and sandwich as well. Looks like they have several locations in Cali which we will hit up as well."}
{"text":"I come here almost everyday. I really like them because they are will to put my vitamins in the smoothie. They also take orders my phone and have them ready within 10mins."}
{"text":"So I haven't lived near or visited an area that has a Tropical Smoothie Cafe in awhile. I came excited to try a smoothie since I normally frequent Jamba Juice. The line for the drive thru had limited options on it. I was disappointed because I knew there had to be more but I had my dog and baby with me and couldn't really get out of the car on a hot day to go inside and peruse. I ordered quick from the few smoothies I saw. My smoothie was delicious. Prices seemed higher than what I pay at Jamba Juice though.

Apparently they have a military discount - ask if this applies to you! Go inside too if you can for a better selection and to really check out their menu!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery of A smoothie and a flatbread.. I live 3 miles away. Going on an hour wait"}
{"text":"They don't have beyond meat at this location, but can make a good hummus wrap. We still prefer having more options like their other locations have. The smoothies are good and can be made without dairy or added sugar/sweetener. Overall yum."}
{"text":"Updated to 5 stars because they keep getting our vegan orders right! Great take-out spot for wraps and smoothies. All meat options can be substituted with Beyond Meat (vegan). Wish they had actual \"vegan\" options listed on the menu so that it was easier to tell someone else what to order for me. My favorite is the Thai Chicken Wrap (substitute Beyond Meat Chicken-Free Strips, no Wontons, Carrots, Sesame Seeds, Romaine, Thai Peanut Dressing in a Toasted Flour Tortilla).

Unless you like your smoothies really, really sweet, you may want to tell them to only add half the sugar (or less). We tell them not to add any sugar or sweetener and the smoothies are perfect (you can actually taste the beet, etc., which we like).

They don't have fountain drinks - only bottled tea, water, pop, but you can go next door to Chipotle for fountain drinks if needed (head left and skip the line if you're just getting a drink)."}
{"text":"I like their smoothies, but like everyone else says, they are understaffed and slow.  Always a long line and slow turn around.  I can make one faster at home so I have been going here less, but always liked the product in the past."}
{"text":"This is the tropical smoothie closest to my house, and I would much rather drive the extra miles to the next closest. Every time I go in here they forget my order, they're rude, and unorganized. There's always new faces working there, but they're all the same and no management or leadership."}
{"text":"This location is like gambling. The chance of you winning (getting your drink right) is less than 1%. I don't mind the wait, but it seems to me that they can never make my drink decent tasting. My usuals are sunrise sunset, peanut butter cup or peanut paradise and It always lack something. 

There are times when I'd catch this location to be slow and I'd think to myself how lucky I am... Then they hand me my drink, I take a sip, then boom! Another crappy smoothie."}
{"text":"All their smoothies comes with splenda!!!!and they don't say it in the menu. Really horrible experience!"}
{"text":"Come here at least 3 to 4 times a week in the morning.  Chia Bannana Boost w/ peanut butter no sugar"}
{"text":"Don't come here if you're in a hurry, while I was waiting several people left because they had not been helped yet. Once I ordered it took at least 30 minute for me to get my order and I only ordered one smoothie. I've had faster service at a full service restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Tropical Smoothie. It is not the one closest to my house, or the one I visit the most, but it is the one I spend the most time at. This location is near the Sears Auto Center where I take my car to get most of the basic maintenance done. While I am waiting I go to Tropical Smoothie. Why? Two reasons, one, I don't really feel the need to wander Sears while my car gets fixed. I am the kind of person that goes to Sears knowing what he wants, not going to look. Second, its a nice place to get a healthy snack (or smoothie) while I wait for my car to be fixed, and I can enjoy the free wi-fi provided by the bagel shop next door.  I like the bagel shop next door, but I really do prefer TS. 
I like this TS because the service is quick. I've found the food and smoothie quality here consistent with other locations, but by far this is the most well staffed and quick TS I've visited. 
I also appreciate that they never give me flack for asking for a wrap that is not the veggie wrap minus the meat. They are always accommodating. 
Additionally, this location of TS has a 24hr drive thru. I've never needed to get a smoothie at 3am, but if I do, I will be coming here."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the happy hour if buy one get one free. It gives you a chance to try different drinks along with your favorite . If you like avocado the avocado drink is the one for you but it was too weird for me. When you go for happy hour be ready to wait inside or the drive thru"}
{"text":"Just ordered a chipotle chicken flatbread and it was completely disgusting! The tomatoes were transparent not even red, the sauce tasted sour like it was spoiled and the lettuce was browning. What a waste of money! One bite in and had to throw it away."}
{"text":"This place sucks bad they have horrible customer service just so who ever knows if they plan on making a delivery they took always 2 hours telling me it would take 45 mins bullshit!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is nasty as hell.  I'm not sure if it is due to management, team members or being understaffed.  It seemed like there was one younger gentleman running the show. Nice enough guy and did a good job on the shake.

To my demised I had to use the restroom. I would recommend going elsewhere. Check out this nasty picture.  SOS here."}
{"text":"Love this place. So much more affordable and tasty than the Jamba competitor. Look for coupons in the mail and buy their \"loyalty\" cup for discounts. FYI for parents they have a kids menu with smaller options for little ones. My daughter loves the\"island greens\". They can be a little slow around lunch time, so don't go if you're in a rush."}
{"text":"I cannot believe how terrible their customer service is. Extremely unfriendly and unmotivated employees."}
{"text":"I got a livingsocial deal for a lunch combo so I decided to try this out with my coworker (who didn't get the living social deal). We waited in line for a long time because there was only one person making food and smoothies, one cashier and no manager. I finally got up to the cashier and asked if she preferred one wrap over another because I didn't decide. She called out to her coworker that someone has a question and she told me she can't answer because she just stared. Um, it was a simple taste based question. Make it up! Then my coworker ordered and paid with a  $20. The cashier said she was out of singles and asked her coworker who called their manager. She told her manager that they're out of singles and that there is a huge line. Then she said her manager told her to tell the customer to pay with a card. What kind of place runs out of money, has a cashier with no training, has huge lines and no manager present during a lunch rush? We waited a long time and I heard the cashier call to her coworker several more times when people had a question about anything! The manager finally came back with more cash and she looked really mad. None of the employees were happy and the cashier and other girl tried their best but it was a horrible experience. To top it off, the jerk chicken wrap was liquidy and the chicken tasted like bad chicken in frozen meals. The smoothie I got was good. This place definitely won't last long. I will definitely never come back to this location but I may try another."}
{"text":"This places is great and healthy .Love their Acai berry smoothie n their flat breads .The place is clean and props to the 2-3 workers that are super fast when its lunch time."}
{"text":"I was really excited to have a smoothie cafe nearby where you can get fresh and almost healthy meals but the service is horrible! They never know what's inside the products they have in their menu! It is never busy ,there are usually 1 or 2 people working and they can't properly manage their time so the service is super slow and very unprofessional . They are completely unorganized and their work place doesn't seem very clean . Don't think I am coming back again ... I am super disappointed !!!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever! Waited in line for over 30 min. Get back to the office to a mushy old lettuce wrap."}
{"text":"This is the worst Tropical smoothie ever! My order is never correct when I order it and the employees are terrible. A manager is never on site and it's a hit or miss for the quality of food. Do not go to this location! The employees are slow and very young. This location needs a major makeover."}
{"text":"Today I spent 15 minutes in the drive thru behind only one car. The car in front of me received there drinks promptly then I sat at the window for 10 minutes. They first opened the window and asked about jerk sauce which was no where close to my order I only got two smoothies so I said you have me confused. Then she asked what my drinks were and went inside to come back saying I ordered 4 smoothies where I told her my order again. Then she came back told me a total and took my money and said it would be two minutes. When she finally handed out my drinks they were incorrect so I handed them back to be made the right smoothie. Finally after all that they still messed up one of my smoothies. It did not have orange in it and it tasted like chemicals."}
{"text":"What a joke this place is. To call itself a Cafe is a funny trick they play on the poor consumer who stops by thinking there might be edible food here. I stopped going to Tropical Smoothie (namely this location) about 8 years ago when I was over getting a sloppily slapped together meal made by some angst ridden teenager taking out his influx of hormones on my wrap. 

Maybe because I am pregnant and not thinking clearly but tonight I wanted something \"light and healthy\" so I thought HEY maybe I should give Tropical Smoothie a try again. LMAO 

Ordered the Baja flatbread and I added avocado. What I received was an inedible sopping wet diaper of a flatbread sandwich. I can only assume as the woman poured ranch onto my flatbread that the lid fell off the bottle and she proceeded to dump all the ranch onto my food. And then stood there in a stupor and asked herself ... \"Should I make it over???...... NAH I gotta clock out\"  There was so much sauce on this flatbread it was like biting into a sauce only sandwich... HOLD THE FOOD. If I wanted a meal of RANCH only I would have walked my ass into the kitchen opened my fridge and poured some directly into my mouth and saved myself the 8 dollars."}
{"text":"Service was horrible the girls here were just hanging out the music was blasting and cuss words left and right f this and f that. no professionalism and just rude, no one smiled or showed any form of welcoming act. By the way are big hoop earrings and stiletto nails a good idea for a food environment?? Hmmm won't be coming back ghetto location!! (The lady making my food was actually the only one that seemed as she was working and the food was good which is why i give it a 2 star)"}
{"text":"The short girl with brown hair has such a little attitude! Very rude- we can tell she was talking about us when we walked in!"}
{"text":"The customer service sucks! The fact that they always run out of thing and it takes forever to get a smoothie. I have gone in there at 4am no wait. The music was so loud he kid working could not even hear me saying excuse me so i left. NO SMOOTHIE! I went yesterday and the CC machines were down so i tried to use the app after 10 min of it spinning she says oh maybe that's not working too, still NO SMOOTHIE! They have to best smoothies. If i found another place no hassles they would be out a lot of customers! Sad!"}
{"text":"Their smoothies are good and prices are reasonable. The wraps are ok too. I love that this place has a 24 hour drive thru but the 2x times I've been here the wait was insane. Even once I was at the window, I waited another 8 mins for my smoothie. Almost left because my baby started to get fussy. I hope they improve in this area."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome but the wait staff are unfriendly and extremely disorganized"}
{"text":"Worst service ever! I came in at 2:00 p.m. on a Sunday and was the only customer in the store. I ordered a chipotle chicken flatbread. There were 2 employees sitting on chairs at the counter and 2 more employees behind the bar stocking bins. Despite the absence of customers and abundance of staff, I didn't get my flatbread until I got up and asked for a refund at 2:15p.m., when I saw no one was making it.

Horrible. Horrible. Horrible customer service. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"The girls working were pleasant, but there was one fatal flaw: sanitation. One girl was preparing the food without gloves, but worse than that, the girl who took my order proceeded to make my food wearing the same gloves she handled money with. Absolutely unacceptable."}
{"text":"I come here all the time, and I stick to what I like. The staff are always friendly, except who I believe is the manager... He is often grouchy and very short. If you are the only customer there, your food will be done pretty quickly, but if there's a line be prepared to wait; there is usually only one person behind the counter. I love all their food, but sometimes things are made better than others. Bottom line is smoothies are always amazing, but food can be a hit or miss. I try to support them, though, anyway!"}
{"text":"We have tried this location at different times of the day, but consistently got the same SLOW service. Today will probably be the last time we visit....ordered a Cucumber Mojito Smoothie. After a 12-min wait with no cars in front of us, my \"smoothie\" came with fruit and ice chunks in it from not being properly blended. Sadly, I can't see this location lasting long. Bummer."}
{"text":"My go to for post work out smoothies. I love that Tropical Smoothie Cafe's use fresh fruit rather than puree and if you're calorie conscious, they have a chart where with calories in each item on the menu. My favorite is Island Green but Lean Machine, Muscle Blaster and Acai Berry Boost are all delicious! If you're like me and like post workout smoothies, you can always add a shot of protein to any smoothie that does't come with it (you also have a choice of Soy and Whey). If you're not like me and like to indulge, they have a selection for you too. This location in particular is great. Staff is pleasant and fast, tables and the counter are always clean."}
{"text":"I walked in to a completely empty store and had to wait several minutes for one of 5 or so employees to acknowledge my presence. The young man who finally decided to approach the counter stopped on his way up, grabbed a huge trash can, and swept some food scraps into it with his bare hands. He then came to the counter and proceeded to stare at me with an expression of disdain in lieu of a greeting. I hightailed it the hell out of there. The manager should consider the fact that people paying $6 for a smoothie should at minimum be greeted with a Hello and clean hands."}
{"text":"Annoying!  I have considered all day why it takes 30 minutes to make a smoothie?   I am annoyed. I just think if they added one more person it would improve the customer experience.  Whoever owns this location should have someone they know go to the location. You could actually double or triple income if it were managed well.  Two smoothies an hour would pay wages for one extra person but create opportunities to make way more revenue.  I am probably spending too much time on this but it pisses me off. Why would waste the money keeping the place open if you are not going to run it well.  It's the only smoothie place in the area and right across the street from several county and state offices.  It's on a busy street and next two other fast food places.  Get it together. Seriously bring in people from other stores.  Just one extra body at less than $60 a day would absolutely improve the situation.  Now that I think about it how many other corners are being cut.  When one out of several locations is rated so badly you would think they would fix it. Ask the other locations what they are doing to perform. If you cannot get quality people then pay more. 30 minutes for two smoothies!!!!   Come on!!! I am officially angry and it's been 11 hours.  Dang!!!"}
{"text":"How can a smoothie place be bad? It's smoothies!!! Tropical smoothie is a great place to go pre or post workout. Just stay away from the turbinado. It's too sweet and you don't need it. 

Every smoothie I have ever gotten there has been good. I tried a coffee smoothie once and loved it. 

They got good food there too."}
{"text":"They need to get their shit together. I ordered a PEANUT PARADISE. What did they give me?  A PARADISE POINT. First of all, why have two flavors with the same common name. Second of all, get the order correct. 

Also, the previous time I was there, the cup was runeth over with smoothie so much so that it dropped all over my shirt and my car. Take the extra 5 seconds to clean the cup before serving me the messy drink."}
{"text":"I will never come here again two nights in a row they mess my order up very unconvenient Due to the fact I works nights! They should consider hiring a night manager or fire Mike ! Smoothie doesn't taste right very horrendous can't even drink it! And I asked for a Jamaican Jerk wrap no onions I got a bowl with onions I'm beyond upset. Lost a loyal customer."}
{"text":"Unless you like long waits and rude service, you may be happier to drive right on past!"}
{"text":"I would give this place no stars if I could. Shame I didn't even get to taste the food, because I never even got to order...
I couldn't believe how rude the chick in the drive thru was. She couldn't hear me through the drive thru mic so slammed open the back door coming by my car to yell, I can't hear you! I asked her my question about a menu item (since on the drive thru they don't have anything listed of what's in their food items, just the name of it) and once she flippantly answered she said, so do you want that? I said no thank you and drove off. I should have looked at all the other Yelp reviews before I wasted my time driving up! This place sounds like it needs an overhaul. Or at least fire all the bratty little kids who sound appalled that they might actually have to work at their jobs."}
{"text":"Tropical Smoothie

This is my go-to smoothie place. I've been here more than a handful of times during many different times of the day, and never have a had a problem with the speed and service from the staff. I never had to wait more than 10 minutes for my order. The staff is accommodating to what I want and quick to fix any mistakes. Get their stamp card to get a free smoothie after you've purchased 10! Also sign up for their text message deals,you often get BOGO texts. I'm a big fan of the Kiwi Quencher, Bahama Mama, and the new Citrus Green Tea with basil. Not too big a fan of the food menu, though."}
{"text":"I want to really like this place since it's so close to my work and we end up eating here all of the time, but it's almost as if they try to find new ways to upset me with inconsistencies and wrong orders.  Among the disappointments (besides the long wait times):

*Ordered a Thai Salad to go, got back to my office and opened it, it was a Thai noodle bowl.  
*Have had smoothie cups filled without about an inch or so of cup space to spare on top.  Are they not measuring ingredients or just rushing through orders? 
*Numerous salads served without dressing.  But they may have rectified that because now the salads are served pre-tossed with dressing. At least they were for one day.
*Wraps that are served scalding hot.  Maybe check the oven temperature gauge.  I've been burned so often with the Jamaican Jerk, that I'm afraid to order them anymore.

What made me finally write was today, while watching my smoothie get made, it may have been too thick, so the worker ran some tap water into the container a couple of times.  Good if you're mixing cement I suppose, but it made the smoothie runny and watery as I'm sure the tap wasn't the same temp as the rest of what had already been blended.  As a result, I got a watery blob that tasted like a weak slurpee.

The original owner ran a tight ship and kept the place spotless and consistent from order to order. Since he left a couple of years ago, this place has gone downhill in terms of quality, cleanliness, and service.  During some of my long waits, I've seen people stand in front of the counter for minutes on end before even being greeted.  You'd think even the blender operators who face the front of the store could at least throw them a \"someone will be with you in a minute\", but no they just act like they didn't see them walk in.

Alas, I'll be back just for the convenient location."}
{"text":"Mediocre service and they gave me a cup with a huge dent/hole in the bottom. They really need to pay attention to what they're doing."}
{"text":"Went there after the gym the guy that helped us gave us horrible customer service he even gave us an attitude & got our order wrong."}
{"text":"This place sucks! Spent over 25 minutes in the drive thru line before being helped. I drove thru without ordering anything. You wasted my time and don't deserve my money!"}
{"text":"Walking into this smoothie shop, I did not have any expectations.

 We waited a solid 5 minutes before someone decided to greet us. Which was actually unpleasant on multiple levels. 
1. No greeting when we entered the establishment. Not even a \"hello\". 
2. The employee who did finally notice us, came forward; didn't crack a smile or anything. Just a  \"pissed off\" attitude and blurted out, \"what do you want?\"
3.After placing my order I saw that they have a \"C\" grade. Which could be for multiple reasons, but if I had to guess it would be how dirty entire store front was. Sticky surfaces, flies everywhere! And the fact the person who took our order was wearing gloves and then proceeded into the kitchen and started cutting fruit. That's disgusting! Handling money and messing with food...seriously? 

Luckily a different employee was making our drinks. When we got them....we were excited...yet my peaches n silk....tastes like strawberries and ice.....no peaches or banana...
My wife got the mango magic, which tastes like mango pureê, that's it. It doesn't even taste like it was blended. Sadly we did not enjoy our experience not our orders. Its sad to see a place like this ran by a horrible unfriendly staff, who are clearly not managed properly. Attitude reflects leadership...and this place has none.

Wish I could give lower than a single star review. If I were you I  would hit up Jamba juice, robecks, or some other bigger chain smoothie shop. At least you get better service and a beverage that tastes like your money's worth."}
{"text":"I stopped in a for a smoothie to enjoy while shopping at Target. I had a large lunch and I knew a smoothie would be the perfect light \"dinner\".

Since it was a Saturday night the café was slow. My husband and I were the only customers. The menu board on the wall was easy to read, even for those of that usually need glasses.  While we waited for our smoothies to be prepared I almost regretted ordering anything because the place was disgusting. Even though the place was dead there was trash on all of the tables and around the dining area. 

I opted for one of the Superfood smoothies. It was delicious and low in calories, but was one of the few smoothies not sweetened with Splenda. Splenda grosses me out beyond description. My husband went with a fruit smoothie and really liked the taste. Smoothie prices seemed high at first, but the servings were huge and definitely justified the cost.

They definitely get a bump in stars for posting nutritional information clearly on their website and on the counter where you order. I love when a business makes it easy for me to make an informed decision."}
{"text":"Quick. Some of the food is just too out of the box and it doesn't work, like the \"wasabi caesar\"...disgusting! Yet the jerk chicken is amazzzing. The smoothies are fantastic and they always have good coupons too. Winner, winner."}
{"text":"I love tropical smoothie so I hate the fact that I'm giving it a 1 star. If I could give this place 0 stars I would! I was ordering smoothies for myself and my hubby! I was standing behind the register and no one said anything to me. Both employees were standing in the back ( which is visible ) blending drinks. No one ever greeted me or said \"I'll be right with you\" which would have made it A LITTLE better since I waited for about 5 min.

The cashier didn't crack a smile, took my order.. And I saw a sign that stated it was happy hour so I was able to get a free smoothie since I purchased 2. There was a couple behind me who also ordered 2 drinks and the cashier didn't even tell them they get a free smoothie!! It wasn't until one of them read the sign and stood up to ask if they can get their free smoothie ( mind you, it took another 5 min for any of the staff to acknowledge him ) within those 5 min an employee walked in, put his stuff away ( right in front of the register ), clocked in ( also ON the register ) and didn't even ACKNOWLEDGE the gentlemen standing in front of him? He didn't even look up ONCE?? Apologizes that he is LATE to the other employees, and he was the manager LOL. OMG.

The manager then goes to the back, the original cashier comes back and asks the customer what he  needs... Then, makes it into a big deal that he is asking for his free smoothie!! She turns to the \"manager\" and asks him if it's OK that they honor the free smoothie.  The manager said it was fine and the cashier seemed annoyed by it! Lady, if you would have just done your job right in the first place and told him that it was happy hour, he wouldn't have bothered you for his free smoothie that he is entitled to since he bought 2.

I was floored by the whole experience, I LOVE their smoothies but completely disgusted by their unprofessional and rude customer service."}
{"text":"Pulled in at 1:40 am and got the best smoothie of my life. Peanut butter strawberries and banana. I also got a half sand which,the turkey bacon which was perfect! Super chill service!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE! We just left this location after purchasing two smoothies and one wrap. Not only that it took FREAKING FOREVER ALMOST 45 MINS! Our wrap was not made right! We PAID for a Southwest wrap no chicken but substitute with extra eggs. Now we get home to see chicken in our wrap. First ever problem with Tropical Smoothie at any location ever! Out of all the night we decided to go to this location ugh! I cant express it enough how TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT is on this location! WHO LEAVES ONE EMPLOYEE WORKING BY HIMSELF ON A BUSY FRIDAY NIGHT?! The kid was nice and we felt really bad that he had to be on his own because a LAZY ARROGANT MANAGER decided not to come in to help. I'M SO IRRITATED because Im a pescatarian and don't eat chicken. It's already almost midnight and we are not coming back to switch the wrap also for the sake of letting the poor boy rest.
Efin POOR BS MANAGEMENT!
Get your sh*t together!"}
{"text":"Yay!  I'm a fan!  Unfortunately, Tropical Smoothie Cafe did not survive in Honolulu and after two trips to this venue on my past vacation - I am sad that none exists closer to where I live.  

Overall, I think the quality of the smoothies is better than Jamba Juice, who I think puts waaay too much sugar (e.g. yogurts, sorbets) in their juices.  Tropical Smoothie on the other hand has more choices of smoothie drinks without the extra sugar, hence lesser calories.  Their sandwiches and salads are a great option too!"}
{"text":"This is the slowest drive thru ever! I was just in it for 25 mins, 15 of it was at the window! As soon as I got to the window they took my payment, and didn't get my order until 15 mins later. The girl at the window apologized and said someone didn't show, ok, but why since I've been at the window I've seen 2 people inside order and receive their order while I'm still waiting? Whatever, all I can do is wait.. finally the tall man came to the window with my order and when he handed me the multiple smoothies I ordered (all green) none of them were labeled like they usually are. I asked which was which and all he could do is stare with a blank look. I told him I'd just figure it out. But once I pulled away, he yelled \"fuck you\" to me, which is incredibly inappropriate. I've tried calling to speak with a manager multiple times and there's never any answer. Needless to say, I will not be returning to this place. Not to mention one of the smoothies was wrong."}
{"text":"Its nice that this place is open 24/7!  Theres nothing more that I crave after going hard at the day club than a nice cold fruit smoothie.

The quality of the smoothie is just ok.  Its strangely  powdery and I'm not sure what the powder is.  All the ingredients listed on the board were fruit and sherberts but I noticed they dumped in a scoop of powder of some sort.  I did decline the free vitamin add-on so I don't think it was that.

I got the classic Mango drink which was pretty similar to mango-a-go-go at Jamba Juice.

I will probably come here again as its the only place open late but I'd prefer Jamba Juice if it was open."}
{"text":"Though I am a fan of Tropical Smoothie overall, I'm not a fan of this specific TS location. It has a drive through (yay!), but the staff doesn't seem to be well-trained. 

My first time here was greeted by an unprofessional employee who also messed up my order 3x. My second time the order was correct but the lady who helped me was pretty unfriendly and didn't seem like she wanted to be working there. 

I know work is work, but it isn't pleasant for the customer to be helped by someone with negative vibes. Just saying."}
{"text":"Much improved customer service since my first visit. The staff was fast and friendly. I like the fact that the smoothies/good are healthy and affordable. I wish they had a smaller size option, but it's not a big deal."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. I came down to this place at 3am the lights were on and the music was super loud inside but the door was locked . No one open me a door I call business phone no one answered either."}
{"text":"Literally the WORST customer service I've ever experienced in my life. I ordered online and stood at the register to pick up my order, while the employees looked at me and kept talking in the back. I told the girl I was picking up an online order and she rudely says \"I'm making it now\". Once she was done she sets it down and walks away, no acknowledgement whatsoever. I was in shock to even be treated like that in general, as I don't think it's hard to at attempt a greeting. I will never come back here again and definitely let my co workers know as well. Per this experience and the reviews, this place is bad vibe central. It's not that hard to treat people nicely."}
{"text":"They're always slow, always running out of certain ingredients to make food. The quality of the smoothies have been bad lately. Just go to a different tropical Smoothie Cafe"}
{"text":"Poor customer service!!!  The girl at the register didn't like talking, she could only point to the menu on the desk when I had a question about an item.  She didn't know the size of their quesadilla and the bottled beverages were warm (my son didn't want a smoothie).  The only reason this gets a star is because I like the smoothies."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews on yelp but I was so happy with Chrissy for being so friendly & helpful. She gave me suggestion on what to throw in to my salad cuz i'm on a strict diet. Once again, thank you Chrissy I hope there'll be more people like you. You're awesome !"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. everybody makes you feel welcomed.
Personally the Bahama Mama is my favorite smoothie but they have so many to choose from  i love it all. The store is super clean compared to other tropical smoothies ive been to in vegas."}
{"text":"Whoever says the food is good must like microwaved chicken?  I googled wraps after I moved to Goodyear.  Now I am used to a local place where I'm from that has hands down the best wraps you've ever eaten (check out La Parilla in Bozeman MT it you're ever there).  Well this place came up so I tried it out.  Yuck!  My husband did have a smoothie and liked it but of course they're pricey (like most smoothie places)
All in all, I would stop in again for a smoothie but I'll look elsewhere for food."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with a Tropical Smoothie Cafe. Love their smoothies specially the Health Nut. Love their wraps too. Service is always awesome especially this location. Glad we found this location on our way from AZ to CA."}
{"text":"First time to this place and I will most definitely be back!! The customer service from every team member in this place was on point! They all chipped in and made suggestions and they even offered to remake my smoothie understanding that the flavor was too intense for some of their patrons. Many places in town could take lessons from this team!"}
{"text":"ho mean, taught I was in Maui when I walked in till BOOM, register talk straight English."}
{"text":"I LOVE smoothie places BUT the two girls that were working on that night I came, absolutely ruined my experience. The entire time they were talking to each other even WHILE I was ordering. I had 2 people with me and as soon as I ordered the first smoothie she gave me my total and closed my check without even asking if I wanted anything else, like hello did I say I was finished?? Did you not see two other people looking at the menu ?? After I had paid with my card they didn't even offer me a receipt I had to ask for it when she had already walked away. That's called horrible customer service...other than THEM the smoothies were actually pretty good."}
{"text":"I swore I would never come here again, and I lied. My co-worker really wanted to go here, and it is the closest one to us, so I caved. Optimistically, I thought maybe the service had improved...I was very wrong...very very wrong. 

We wait 30 mins for two smoothies and a sandwich. They forgot my friend's order FOUR TIMES. They completed everyone's order before hers, and sporadically came back a few times to continue asking what she ordered. We were baffled. We noticed she kept coming back to the register to write down orders on a napkin! Isn't there a ticketing system for this?! 

Two other women we were waiting with had placed orders over the phone and had to wait almost as long as we did! What is even the point of offering this service?!

We barely had time to eat before we had to get back to work. 

Dear god, Tropical Smoothie, please for the love of God...HIRE MORE PEOPLE TO WORK THE LUNCH RUSH. 

P.S. They got rid of their stamp cards at all locations. No more free smoothies."}
{"text":"They moved. Place is nice, clean, and brand new. Seating is sparse for the amount of open space.

Lastly, I know they're new but put up a sign with your hours! I walked in at 915. They were making smoothies. I was standing right there. They said \"sorry inside is closed drive through only.\" Uh then lock your door. Why can't you help me if I'm standing right there-- that would be excellent customer service. I'm sure your till doesn't make a difference if the money was taken in versus out. Lock the door after me. 

I walked right out and across the street."}
{"text":"Wish I could've left 0 stars. We waited so long for our smoothies 20+ mins. Just not worth it, waste of time.

Update after waiting twenty plus mins, the smoothie girl comes out and says the yogurt that we need to make your smoothie is frozen. Would you like me to make it without it? I said no thanks this whole experience has been awful I'm just gonna leave. By this time the place is full of unhappy customers that have been waiting for ever. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Unfriendly staff.  No soap in bathroom.  No peanut butter for smoothie we wanted to order.  Ones we ordered...not good.  Very icy.  First and last time!"}
{"text":"They are short staffed and slow for lunch rush.  People just give up and leave hungry!"}
{"text":"I went in for what I thought would be a quick lunch. I waited for the lady to get finished with the order ahead of me which wasn't a problem. Then she had to restart her computer before she could take my order (she's the only one working). Once I ordered (hummus wrap no red onions) she took the two ladies order behind me but didn't start making anything for a few minutes. Then another worker walked in and it sounded like he made the sandwich's and wraps. He didn't start making anything for awhile and the lady has just started making the other ladies drinks. In the mean time another lady comes in saying her drink was powdery so she made her another drink. All this time and no food has come out from the back, so when it did I just grabbed it and went home to eat it without checking it, bad idea. It was a soupy grey mess, the tortilla was soggy, beans falling out, stuff dripping out from the bottom. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"I love this tropical smoothie. Their customer service is absolutely amazing. The girls there never fail to make me smile. And the boys, are always very full of information. 
Love coming to this location."}
{"text":"I get that you may not want to serve someone 30 minutes before closing, but that's what you were hired to do. Having spent tons of money here over the past two years, I'll never be back. I literally just left this place after being left standing in the front of the store forever. The short red headed girl working tells me she'll be right back, and then disappears in the back of the store to make a phone call. It's clear it's a personal call. While I'm waiting, she sneakily peeks to see if we are still there. Seriously???"}
{"text":"I love TSC and there is this girl named Viviana that is so bubbly and amazing it just makes this location stand out above the rest!"}
{"text":"Worst service! I come here at least 1 time every other week and it always takes SO long and the employees are not professional. I go through the drive thru most of the time and it takes almost 15-20 minutes... with TWO cares in front of me. That is ridiculous! They need to hire more people."}
{"text":"Today I stopped by and got the Detox Island Green and it was pretty tasty and very fresh. I definitely will keep coming back to try their other drinks!"}
{"text":"Pricey, little food for the big $$ you spend."}
{"text":"I've been eating here almost everyday for about 2 weeks now on my lunch break from school, the food here is really good! The tropical smoothie by my house was disgusting but love this location!"}
{"text":"I stood for 10 mins while the girl behind the counter ignore me and one other customer while we wait. I did not have to time to wait around for some snooty girl to decide to great us. I left I have no clue how much longer the person who was also waiting waited. But I doubt it was fast service. I will never be back to this location. I would have asked for the manger but that would have required the person who worked there to speak to me. I would have gotten her name but could not see it. I hope she get fired soon. This is not how you run a business."}
{"text":"I love the location, right across the street from my gym (LVAC).  I love the almost guilt free menu options.  (Buffalo Chicken Wrap and Rockin Raspberry Smoothie this trip).  I even love the deals they have at this location like buy 2 smoothies get one free from 4-7pm and their free junior all american wrap with purchase of a smoothie from 7-10am.  

The two star rating is spawned from the seemingly intolerable drive-thru wait time and service.  On this particular trip I decided to time my experience.  36 minutes total from line entrance to smoothie acquisition.  On top of that I was charged for 3 smoothies initially despite being well within the buy 2 get 1 free time window.  As a minor aside they also neglected to ask what sort of \"side\" I wanted with my wrap.  I guess I sounded like a Baked Sour Cream and Onion chips kind of guy?  Perhaps management needs to hire additional staff or streamline his production process?  The young man that waited on me seemed pretty stressed out."}
{"text":"Horrible experience!! They wouldn't take Yelp check in discount. We called ahead of time for our food. The girl on the phone said our food would be ready when we got there. Guess what? NOT!! We still needed to wait for 30 minutes because they forgot to put our order together! Forget it! Will not go back again for sure!!"}
{"text":"If you value customer service - do not go here!!! I've been here twice and refuse to ever go back to this location, even though it's a mile from my home and work. I'll travel across town before I come back. I don't know if it's because they're just teenagers without experience or what, but both times the customer service has been terrible!!! I walked in the first time, there was a young man standing behind the counter, so I smiled and said \"Hi, how are you?\" He said nothing and just looked at me. I asked if they had a seasonal flavor that was supposed to be \"coming soon\" and he was clueless and just scoffed at me. I was standing right beside a giant banner for the flavor so I pointed and said \"This? Do you have this one yet?\" He rolled his eyes and said \"no, it says it's coming soon so it's not here yet.\" I should've just walked out, but I just ordered something else. It took over 5 mins to get my drink - and I was the ONLY customer!!! I heard them giggling and laughing and joking around in the back - irritating. But the second visit was even better! My boss took me there for a treat when our power was out during the hot summer. We walked in and the same young man was behind the counter. She smiled and said hello and he again said nothing. I just said to myself \"here we go again!\" We walked up and started to order. After listening to our entire order,  he said \"oh I'm off for break\" and smiled. He yelled back to the back for some girl to come up and take our order, to which we were greeted with a nasty scowl from her. She gets up to the counter and without saying \"hi, how are you, sorry about that\", instead she YELLS at the young man and says \"what, you couldn't even take their order??!\" My boss turned to me, remembering my first experience and said \"is this the one you went to and told me about?\" I shook my head yes and the girl behind the counter said \"oh, was it a good experience?!\" My boss said \"no, actually it wasn't! Your customer service here stinks! You yelled at him from across the restaurant with customers standing in front of you - that's not good customer service!\" She quickly apologized and ended up giving us a deal, even though we didn't ask for one, nor were we expecting it. Unfortunately it was a little too late to smooth over our waters - both my boss and I refuse to go back to this place. It's just not worth it!!"}
{"text":"What an awesome spot for lunch!!!  Two mojo fish tacos and a large smoothie for $5.93.  Can't beat this price!!!  The Island Green smoothie is a must have.  The young gentleman behind the counter was very polite and friendly.  Glad I found a local spot for delicious and healthy smoothie."}
{"text":"Two experiences, two drinks, two sandwiches... and go to review!

Well, I ate here two days in a row on my lunch break. Mostly because I was really liking their small sandwich portions paired with a smoothie. I was getting tired of eating huge sandwiches or big meals on my lunch breaks, so the smaller portions from TSC were a better option for me.

First off I've had quite a few smoothies from TCS and although I like most of them I tend to stay away from anything that has pineapple in the name because I think it just makes the smoothie taste weird. My favorite smoothie from here is the one that is mainly blueberries (I forget the name). 

The food was pretty decent. I have had the Pesto Chicken and the Buffalo Chicken wrap. Is it great? No, not really. But is it okay for the price, plus getting a smoothie to go with it? Yes. 

However, the girl working the register the first time I went put me off. She was unprofessional and slightly rude. I was really glad she wasn't working the second day I came here for lunch. 

I like Tropical Smoothie, but I like Jamba Juice better for smoothies in general."}
{"text":"If I had the option I'd give this place negative stars. Worst customer experience. Slow. No excuse to take forever to make sandwiches when you have another person working with you and no drive thru.  Employee doesn't even greet you. Stares at you without even communicating, like what do you want me to say? Lazy."}
{"text":"The only reason I keep going back here is because my kid is addicted to the smoothies.  The kitchen is not very clean and just looks gross. All of the food is microwaved pretty much so it isn't that good.  But it is a pretty cheap reward for my kids after her therapy on Friday's so that's ok. They do have a lot of specials on food and smoothies which is nice."}
{"text":"The employee had called up our name, but another guest had taken our order. The other guest then drank our drinks to figure out that it wasn't his. He then approached the employee who seriously- gave us the drinks that have already been sipped out of!! Unacceptable per health codes. We approached the lead employee on staff who said that the other guest said he did not drink from our drink. 

Whether he did or not, it's against health regulations to take something back that someone was already in possession of. It's even more against heath regulations to give that SAME EXACT item to another guest. 

So disappointed."}
{"text":"I come here for a quick and healthy meal and I definitely found a few items I enjoy; however, there are several things that bother me. Hopefully a manager will read this and make positive changes. One of the things they struggle with is consistency, sometimes my smoothie taste really good and other times really bland. Half the time I get a different type of cheese on my sandwich than what I ordered. On multiple occasions I've been charged the wrong price or received the wrong order. One time I waited a half an hour for a smoothie that was super bland and icey. 

What's more frustrating is the only place online where the menu prices are listed is the 4 photos on here, but everything really cost like a $1 more. Not only does the prices need to be updated, but so do the ingredients. Most of the food items say it comes with romaine lettuce when it really comes with iceberg. If you're going to switch to cheaper ingredients and raise all the prices, then at least make sure you're being consistent and providing great customer service"}
{"text":"All I wanted to say about this place is that they always have fresh  ingredients for your smoothie and great customer service there employees are very courteous always smiles"}
{"text":"Couldn't find Jamba Juice so I came here . Customer service was good . My smoothies were delicious. And the wait wasn't long"}
{"text":"I typically go to this Tropical Smoothie all the time because I work in the area and I usually don't have any problems during the morning but it seems like at night time the drive-thru is 24 hours but nobody is ever working or takes your order so I end up leaving and going to Roberto's"}
{"text":"New store, very convenient location. Has a drive thru so that's an added plus. I ordered the paradise point smoothie, my personal fave, at the drive thru. When I got to the window, looked in my purse only to realize that my wallet was not inside. I told the young lady, Camille, who also happens to be the manager that I will just have to come back for my drink (I only live a couple minutes away) but she said not to worry about it and gave me my drink anyways. Wow, that's great. She just made my day. Will be back tomorrow morning and pay forward."}
{"text":"I love tropical smoothie! BUT this specific location isn't very professional. Went through the drive thru window and the person on the speaker kept saying \"I can't hear you!\", \"I can't understand you!\", \"Please pull up to the window to order. I can't hear anything you are saying!\". I pull up to the window and it's obvious that he couldn't hear a word I was saying because the music inside of the restaurant was sooooo loud! Music was kind of inappropriate as well. The Weeknd. EXPLICIT!! I feel bad for the owner/manager of this location because it's obvious that these kids that you hire have no pride in your business! So sad!"}
{"text":"You're me. Sitting in the drive-through. Staring at their gross, ripped up sign. Greeted by someone who said \"I'll be right there\". Sat there for about 8 minutes and decided to back out. Went and got Taco Bell instead. You s*ck Tropical Smoothie on Simmons"}
{"text":"This place sucks!  They move at a snails pace and if their boyfriend comes in after you order... they spend 20 minutes making them something before even serving you!  Horrible service!  Never mind the manager who comes walking out in slippers!"}
{"text":"I am glad I was introduced to this place. The food is really good. I tried the Caribbean jerk wrap. It was tasty and filling. Wrap itself was good quality and not just a tortilla. I had a taste of everything in each bite which was nice that ingredients were evenly distributed. I would have tried a smoothie but the wait was very long because one of the employees decided to take lunch at the busiest times. Not a good idea because we waited too long for for our food. I was patient but not everyone else was. I am just glad I am not a snob and I was in a good mood. Now if I was not satisfied with my food this review would be different. Oh and the floors really need some mopping. The were super sticky."}
{"text":"When you have teens making your food just don't expect much. Sorry, I was a teen once and worked at a food place but I cared about what I made and did. I ordered a sandwich with no kale and they didn't put kale but they forgot the entire Apple and carrot slaw it comes with. So I'm just eating a sandwich with cheese and turkey. And an expensive one at that.  Cool.  

As I'm waiting for my sandwich I see the girl toss it on the metal table right next to the window while a young guy is tossing a cleaning bottle on the table in a game trying to get it to land upright. I watched him do it several times right next to my sandwich- even once the bottle coming loose and him having to tighten it. Knowing there was liquid all over it he kept tossing it next to my food yes the bag did have some wet liquid on it but I wasn't concerned because the sandwich was wrapped up inside the bag. But I still told the kid he needs to not toss a cleaning product right next to peoples food to which he seemed confused and said Okay. Hopefully he realized how dumb that was. 

Whoever is managing the store-when you have teenagers working for you please train them properly. I understand teenagers are pretty much gonna be the only people working at places like this so I shouldn't expect much but come on how do you really not know better to not toss a cleaning bottle next to peoples food. Not the brightest crayon in the box. Also I know people were watching him do this because he was showing off for people and how do those people not know to say hey you probably shouldn't do that. 

These are the types of people working and handling your food. This turned me off from coming here again. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I feed my big-time gambling addition ($20 max per night, oh maybe a rare $40) once a week at Red Rock.  And most of those nights I have to feed me, too.  Where else is quick and reasonably priced but the food court?  Sometimes it's Rubio's, sometimes Capriotti's, and once in a while, it's Tropical Smoothie.  

I've never ordered a smoothie in my life.  Okay, call me un-American, I can take it.  But I have ordered food on more than one occasion, though have never written a review until now.  Each time I eat there, I'm always afraid the food isn't going to be fresh, because I almost never see anyone ordering ANYTHING there.  I'm happy to report that it is, and that it's also very good.

This time I tried their new Chipotle Cranberry Turkey Club.  I had them hold the bacon, because I'm that weirdo who actually looks at the nutritional info they have available, and figured I'd save a few calories.  But I got everything else - the turkey, cheddar and spinach, which was deliciously raw.  The cheese was toasted onto the bread.  A chipotle cranberry sauce added a little bit of zip to the turkey, which hallelujah! was not overly salty.  But it was the bread that made me a believer.  This is multi-grain bread that they say is thinly sliced, but it was thick enough for me.  It was lightly toasted - too lightly - but it was filled with all kinds of crunchy seeds that added a whole different dimension to the sandwich.  I despise whole wheat bread, mainly because it's always too sweet - if I want cake, I'll eat cake.  But this was not whole wheat.  I LOVED IT!  And guess what?  I'm gonna have another one during this week's charitable donation staycation at Red Rock.  Tropical Smoothie rocks!"}
{"text":"I love tropical smoothie but this location has the slowest service ever! The employees are nice but I waited about 40 minutes for 2 smoothies!!!"}
{"text":"Go for the smoothies but do not, under any circumstances, order the food. It's horrible, truly horrible. I got a baja chicken flatbread that was such a sad little sandwich. The chicken was inedible- rubbery and microwaved. The smoothie was     satisfactory."}
{"text":"Food and smoothies are awesome and consistent.  The employees are not happy to be here and I always feel like I'm putting them out when I show up."}
{"text":"8 people walked out and they never even acknowledged we were there. 

Would not recommend I wish this was still a Starbucks 

They only had two people working and they lost the key for the cash register so they were scrambling  trying to find it."}
{"text":"Jacob makes the BEST smoothies!  Not that I had to say it aloud.. everybody already knows it!!  I'm a regular to Tropical Smoothie and this location is my easily favorite, especially when Jacob is working. Not only does this man always exhibit superb customer service skills, his consistently friendly and polite demeanor is absolutely refreshing and greatly appreciated. If this store was run by nothing but Jacob's, it would be the best Tropical Smoothie anyone could possibly go to!"}
{"text":"I love tropical smoothie, but this location lacks customer service. There's only been one employee that has been cheerful at this location, while everyone else seems indifferent. Service is also really slow even when there's no one there. However, my smoothies have never required extra blending after receiving them and have always tastes great, which is why I didn't give them 1 star. Just wish the employees were friendly and didn't seem annoyed all the time."}
{"text":"Drive thru and inside the cafe both have very slow services. Been here multiple times and everytime i spend about 15-20 minutes waiting and an extra 5 minutes just waiting for someone to take my order. Prepare a good amount of time when coming here because you will be waiting."}
{"text":"Do not go here they are not friendly rude and just plain inconsiderate I walked over here from hard rock since they said 24 hour drive thru once I got there the Libby said opens at 8 and it's 7:55 it's also 100 degrees outside they thought I was gonna stand in heat for 5 minutes so I walk to drive thru and they tell me they can't serve me because I'm on foot I just left"}
{"text":"I use to love coming to this place. And I've never had an issue before. I usually buy a regular size smoothie for myself and ask them to pour some of it into a kids cup for Caden. This time they told me that they cannot pour excess into a kids cup. I said that's fine because I'm not asking for the excess I just want them to pour some of my cup into a kids cup. When I went to get my cup they just gave me an extra little styrofoam cup on the side for me to pour my drink into. Which was fine for me but then none of the lids fit on it and we were getting it to go.  So I asked for a kids cup that I can put a lid on and they said that they couldn't give me one. They said they couldn't give me one for excess. I think they don't know the meaning of excess. Because it's not excess if it's pouring from my own drink that I purchased.  I thought this was hilarious. I feel like they don't know what it's like to have a kid. Kids spill drinks and so of course I want a lid for my sons drink. I paid more for a big size so I don't think it should be an issue. I know can pay less for a kids size. It's just that a reg size is more than enough for me and I share everything with Caden. I honestly don't think I'll be coming here again and will just make my own smoothies at home."}
{"text":"Love that there are drive throughs! But they never have enough staff on the weekends which is wrong to your employees. They stress out bc the customers demand. Every weekend there is one person working and serving the inside and drive through.  I already know what it is so don't blame them But damn staff enough people to serve the customers properly. It's not like great quality smoothies, but not terrible. Convenient and tasty."}
{"text":"I feel like every time I come here I get terrible service, and there's no good smoothie I can go to, last time I waited more than 20 minutes, and this time the girl seriously forgot the whole order we had just placed, just super annoying"}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes in drive thru and I was only the second person in line! Usually I wouldn't mind waiting and I know like stuff happens, but it was soooo long"}
{"text":"Saw a server at the drive-thru window signing to a carload of Deaf people recently. She deserves 10 stars for that."}
{"text":"I have never seen a more unprofessional place and a manager who don't know how to manage and be fair with employees Hannah needs manager classes. I give them 1 star I would even say that's high"}
{"text":"Kind of quiet and I really didn't even know that it was here but I'm glad I stopped at this location today. Very nice guys and a delicious flatbread. I will be back again. Thank you for lunch!"}
{"text":"I ordered from this location for a catering order for work.
The food arrived on time (via EZCater).  The food was plentiful and quite a bit for 10 ppl.  Win Win in that department.  I ordered an assorted sandwich platter & loaded spinach salad (which came w tons of pecans, bacon, candied pecans, Gorgonzola, peaches, dried cranberries, and raspberry vinaigrette).  Listen that dressing was everything.  Not too sweet, not too bitter.  PERFECT!  Also ordered the Fruit Medley.  That was really no big deal.  Apples, oranges and grapes all cut up very fine.  
My only complaint is that I ordered chips w the platter and did not receive any.
I would definitely order again but was just a bit disappointed."}
{"text":"The worst tropical smoothie in town!! 

1. Very young inexperienced kids working, all of them look high when they're working every time I go there.
2. This place is always dirty. Either under renovation with boxes all over the place, menus scattered around, no organization whatsoever.
3. Watery smoothie every time. I'm not paying $7 a smoothie to drink juice, where's the ice?? 
4. I specifically ask for them to sub ciabatta bread for whole grain bread *i even specify by saying THE BREAD WITH THE SEEDS AND GRAINS ON THE CRUST*, and it never fails that I am given ciabatta bread once again. 
5. At the moment I have called the store 3 times to ask for my money back about my order yesterday that was completely wrong and nobody is answering the phone."}
{"text":"They have a chipotle chicken that I recently tried there and it is amazing!!! The service was very good, they definitely know what customer service is. Every time I come here they are polite and quick. I definitely recommend this location!"}
{"text":"I go here 5 times a week for breakfast before work. Always greeted by the friendly staff who display great customer service. Normally I wouldn't think to review a 'fast food' place, but the exceptional service should be recognized."}
{"text":"Well... now I understand why Tropical Smoothie sends out  various deals via text, because the place sucks and they are trying to drum up business. I ordered a wrap and a small smoothie. The employee kindly upgraded my small to a large at no cost, she was super nice, but when I got home and saw my wrap it was beyond nasty! It looked like someone threw together ingredients and covered it with nasty sauce and a tortilla. It was super messy and very unappealing! Plus, my stomach has been hurting ever sense eating that. Ugh. Won't be back. Please, put something better in the Anthem shopping plaza!"}
{"text":"I love tropical smoothie but after going to this location a few times it's just not as good as the one on lv boulevard. One of my usual drinks is the rockin raspberry and it tasted sour and disgusting, I ended up throwing it away. The girl who works there late doesn't seem so enthusiastic to be there either."}
{"text":"So we have been coming daily for about a month to get 2 Mango Magic. This morning I pulled up to the drive through after waiting behind 2 other vehicles. I was told, \"we cannot take any orders because the computers are down\". Yet the two other vehicles ahead of me are blocking the way out of the drive through. I guess their orders must have been before the computer malfunction, not sure. I told the person on the speaker that I was a regular customer. In my opinion as a business owner, this was a great opportunity to say, \"we'll take your order and if the computers are still down when finished the drinks are on us\".  I am so honest that I would have paid later when the computers were up or next day. Unfortunately, for this location there will not be a next day. As it stands I had to back out of the drive through and left perturbed. Their are lots of other Tropical Smoothie locations I could patronize, and I will."}
{"text":"As I'm not the first to comment on the poor customer service at this location, management clearly needs to change something around here; whether it's their efforts to improve workplace morale or the employees altogether. This is a great location and a great franchise. It's such a waste to be reflected with anything less than 4 stars..

**Five Stars to the franchise itself**
The smoothies are always great here, their super grain bowls are delicious and filling, and the rest of the food is decent for healthy \"fast\" food. They also run great promos and offer coupons, though it's too bad they got rid of the customer loyalty cards.

**Two stars for the inconsistency of service at this particular location**
I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt, as I have always been content with the delivery of their product. However, this is now the third time I've had to wait five to ten minutes for someone to just come to the register and take our order... try politely calling out for someone? No response, they still come at their leisure. In each of these situations, there were at least two people working, zero orders in que, and attitudes of being completely unapologetic about the wait. Regardless of what behind-the-scenes responsibilities you have, customer service is supposed to come first.. but that's clearly not the case here.
I've also tried to call this place at least three times (twice to place an order for pickup and once just to get someone to come to the register) and it seems no one thinks answering the phone is part of their job."}
{"text":"Wow I miss Trop! The prices are great for the amount of smoothie you get. They always have new combos and the ability to customize everything for your needs. They have a wide variety of things you can add depending on if you want protein after a workout, energy, fiber, etc. 

I LOVE the health nut and again you get a ton of smoothie for roughly $3-$5. I always went here when I lived here and have never experienced a bad drink or bad experience. Also they have an app that has different specials and their rewards system. I love when places have rewards, especially a bogo free off anything on the menu like the worker informed me had happened yesterday. 

Their food is pretty good and cheap! I usually got a panini with chicken in addition to a smoothie. Loveeeee visiting Trop when I'm here in Vegas!"}
{"text":"\"Trop\" is probably my favorite smoothie place. I just wish they had locations in Reno so I could get one when I'm at home and not just on vacation. 

They have a wide variety of flavors and display all the delicious ingredients and add ins to truly make the best out of your morning breakfast. I wish they had some of the nutrition benefits of them but that's just my inner college nutrition student speaking. I LOVE the chia banana boost smoothie with whey protein. 

I usually don't get their food but their wraps I have occasionally and they're pretty good! Nice if you're extra hungry and want to supplement your smoothie. 

The service is moderate-good. It truly depends on how busy it is because it's a smaller place. If you go early enough, you get served right away and can enjoy your delicious health packed breakfast! LOVE LOVE LOVE!"}
{"text":"Complete morons working here. Pretty much an embarrassment how slow and incompetent they are. 

Won't be coming back to this location ever again. Been here 3-4 times and the dolts working here always screw up or take forever to get me my smoothie.  Twice it took over 20 minutes for 1-2 smoothies!  Wtf?

Don't go here. Pick another Tropical Smoothie. There are plenty around town."}
{"text":"Ive found the staff to be pretty cool the two times I've been here. the guy was actually really nice he made sure I liked my smoothie and offered to remake it if I didn't since it was one I'd never tried before. But I liked it so it all worked out lol. My sandwich was good too."}
{"text":"I like Tropical Smoothie Cafe and if you work anywhere near family court, you MUST be as excited as I am that this place opened!!  I went on April 25, and I think it had just opened the day before or something like that.  It was crowded (see the aforementioned excitement at this place opening near family court) but well staffed.  I think they were still working out some bugs as everyone ordered PRETTY MUCH the same thing yet the prices were ALL OVER THE BOARD, but I do think they will get this worked out.  The food was good, the smoothies were great, and I am hopeful the service will follow!!"}
{"text":"The last three times I have been here I waited over 15 mins in the drive through.  This place is the worst. I should have learned by now not to go back. You pull into drive through and get stuck. Staff acts like it is no big deal.  They are not busy just SLOW!"}
{"text":"Oh how I wish I could give more. I love tropical smoothie but I may have to rethink this location. I walked into the store and only one other customer was there. They were having some sort of malfunction with the registrar so thy were writing orders down by hand, no big deal. I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap with no tomatoes (yum!) I sat done at a table unable to pay and waited to see what the process would be. One worker was on the phone trying to fix the phone while another made the smoothies and the third just trolled around unsure what to do. The unsure one brought me my smoothie and some post it notes where he asked for my card to write down the number. I was not super keen on the idea but understood they need my money some way another. He wrote down all my info and then they got the machines working. He began to ring up my order which came out to double them amount, thank goodness I didn't end up blind sided by the charge later. I explained to him how the meals work and he then lowered the price. I asked for the paper with my card back, just to be safe. After all that I got my wrap where he just then realized he put tomatoes on it because he \" forgot to read the note\". Unfortunately for his excuse it was lousy considering he was the one that took the note. I said it was ok and wanted to be on my way because I was real ready to go by then. All in all I think it's best if these workers have some sort of management around.


Update, just got home to eat my food and it taste terrible. And not just because of the tomatoes!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the worst Tropical Smoothie establishments in Vegas.  I only go when I am on this side of town and I REALLY want their food.  Normally service is very slow and the order WILL be messed up.  Whenever I go, I just make sure I am not in a rush and double check my order if I am using the drive thru (this includes tasting the sandwich).  Most recently, they combined two different sandwich recipes into one."}
{"text":"Third times a charm! I don't know why there's only a 3 star rating because everytime I come here or s been nothing but great.  It's very clean and the staff is very friendly and helpful! The tropical chicken salad sandwich is my favorite, and the smoothies are fresh and excellent!"}
{"text":"Wait in drive through for 20+ minutes. When I got to the window I could see 2 of the workers just talking while the person that wa son the window making my meal. The middle aged women came, tries to give me a wrong order and when I told her that they should help the guy she started talking back and saying that I don't know what I'm talking about. So rude. Didn't know talking to coworkers was in the job description"}
{"text":"Generally a good spot to eat .. Not sure what is wrong with this location. Order 1st time delivery.. Super excited about it since it's close to work and I didn't have to leave to get food.... 4$ delivery charge. Ordered at 12:30.... 1:15 lady calls and asks if I received my food yet... Nope! She said that they guy was on his way... Ok.... 2:15 still no food. I called at 2:30 and was just going to cancel... I was super busy at work or I would have called way before and just canceled all together... By this point I was so hungry that I was to the point of not even being hungry anymore if that makes sense. The lady said he was 5 mins away. Ok so I ordered my food at 12:30 and I didn't receive it until finished eating at 2:45 ...insane! Oh driver expected a tip.. Sorry no tip for you.. 

2nd experience we had a girl from the office go pick the order up.. 3 people ordered.. 3 sandwiches and 3 smoothies.. All 3 sandwiches had mold on the bread!!!! Are you freaking serious! Again with this place. Ok.. So I called the store .. No answer ..the recording said to Leave a message.. No I'm not going to leaving a message. So I called the delievery line and the girl there tells me that she is not located at the actual store where they make the food, which I figured. She was very apologetic and took my info and offered to comp our future meals at a different location. I have always had really good experiences at all other locations.. not sure what the deal is here. :("}
{"text":"I'm not even gonna lie: I love me some smoothies. I think smoothies combine all the deliciousness and healthy-ness of fruit, but it's in drinkable form! Win for easier consumption!

I really like this place, and am currently in the process of trying every item on the menu. I don't have a favorite just yet (rather, they're all my favorite) but I'm sure I will once I've had all of them. They also have pretty tasty sandwiches, too. I've had a the one with pesto (I forget the name) a few times, and it's pretty good!

My only complaint about this place is that I usually come a little before 8am on weekdays before work. Even when I'm the only one there, I have to wait too long to get my order out. I don't understand how it could take that long. I understand when places are packed, not so much when I'm the only customer."}
{"text":"Tell your employees to stop sitting in the back and leaving literally no one in the front so when people come in they have to wait 5 minutes JUST for someone to come up and realize they're there. That's ridiculous."}
{"text":"Frequently visit here, and slowly but surely every visit has gotten worse. Today's customer service was the worst I've ever experienced. The cashier ( didn't catch her name) she was in a pink hoodie. Super rude, un helpful, treated me like I was stupid. I get she's upset she's in her late 40s working here with 18 yr olds but that's on her..."}
{"text":"This cafe is in the strip mall at Gilbert commons on Baseline Rd.The food is Fresh and healthy.They have numerous varieties of smoothies,i love the fact that the drinks are so delicious even with ingredients like kale,spinach,avocado etc.

The Artisan tacos are phenomenal 
Smoked jalapeno chicken (Grilled chicken, bacon, cabbage, tomatoes, red onions & smoked jalapeño spread in a flour tortilla) 
Cilantro lime fish (Grilled tilapia, cabbage, spicy cilantro sauce and house-made roasted pineapple salsa with red onions & cilantro in a flour tortilla)

They also have salads,wraps and sandwiches on their Menu. 

The only thing is that they are not very consistent,so it's like a hit or miss.
Service is slow (they seriously need to hire more staff)
The Staff is Nice and they do have outdoor seating.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Got there and they ran out of yogurt and bananas. Seems like the key ingredients for a smoothie."}
{"text":"Finally got one near home!  We went through the drive thru during happy hour so it was buy 2 get one free!  3 smoothies cost $12.95 (I get extra yogurt in mine). Not a bad deal. The guys working the window were very nice and friendly. The service was fast and the smoothies were great!  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"YUMMY is the perfect word to describe this place!! Alana is always so nice and has great customer service!! So many selections to choose from and the prices are not bad at all. Just suck it up cuz the smoothies are a wonderful relief, especially during the summer time when its soo hot out! This is my go to place for any time of the day!!"}
{"text":"If you enjoy sitting in the drive thru for an eternity, then this is the place for you! But it's not just this location, it's happened to me at the one in Aliante also. When I asked the guy what on earth took so long, (it was almost a 30 min wait) he said the delivery guy came and he had to handle that. Really?"}
{"text":"I was in the Vegas area and my son had a craving for a power smoothie before his practice. There were several locations on Yelp, but they were either closed, too far, or under construction.  We finally found this place. It looked closed but the doors were unlocked. My son and I walk in and there was nobody around.  I knew it was operational cuz I could hear machines working and music playing in the background. We even yelled \"hello!\"  Standing there for a several minutes, I thought the place got robbed, but nothing looked disturbed. We just laughed and said \"what is going on, this is soooo weird.\"  Eventually two workers came from the back. I just ordered my sons Kiwi smoothie and called it good. Even though we waited hella long for a human to emerge, we got the smoothie lickity split."}
{"text":"This Tropical Smoothie store is my favorite location. Probably because it is closet to my house.  It's located on W Charledton just East of Towncenter Dr.

You have to wait too long sometimes at night because they are under staffed. The staff is pretty quick here, but there is only so much one person can do with a store full of customers. They are finally one of the locations that are open 24/7. Now I don't have to drive to Flamingo at night anymore.

They have great smoothies. I usually get the Tropi Colada or the Acai Berry Boost with Splenda. They also have pretty good wraps and sandwiches too. I like the wasabi roast beef sandwich.

If you enjoy smoothies give this place a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"As far as smoothies go, Tropical Smoothie makes awesome smoothies.  I like the Tropi Colada and the Acai Berry Boost with Splenda. They also make pretty good wraps and sandwiches. I usually get the wasabi roast beef sandwich.

This is one of the locations that are open 24 hours. Which is great when you want a smoothie at night. They have a great staff here. The drive thru line seems to always run smoothly. I don't recall ever having to wait too long.

This location also has a great deal. If you buy two smoothies you get one free between 4pm and 7pm every day."}
{"text":"For some reason, this location does not make the smoothies like the other stores around Vegas. The smoothies here taste like blended ice. They don't even blend the smoothies enough. They taste more like slush than smoothies. This has happened on several occasions."}
{"text":"I've been a regular here for years now and have never had bad food or smoothies. Every so often, a new kid will make a \"crunchie\" but they remake it without a fuss. I deducted one star because there hasn't been a single visit where the dining room isn't dirty or even destroyed. I know they stay busy. But, someone needs to run out from the back occasionally to wipe down tables and pick up trash! However, nothing will come between me and my Peanut Paradise!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service!

I came on Feb 23. There were two girls behind the counter (one of them pregnant). I said \"hi\" but they completely ignored me and instead started to chat with another employee who entered after me. I stood literally in front of them, but they just kept chatting with him and ignoring me. I patiently waited and waited and waited and waited ... and then I moved my hands in front of them and said \"hello, you got a customer\". The pregnant one gave me a very annoyed look. The other one finally took my order and actually apologized. But then she left. So the pregnant one very very slowly moved inside and very very slowly did my wrap ... never ever said she' s sorry or tried to smile or somehow make it better. 

I don' t know who is the owner, but please you really need to hire new employees!"}
{"text":"Keep it classy Tropical Smoothie. Walked in and the kid at the register had hickies ALL over his neck. The girl working with him literally just SAT on the counter on her cell phone while he took orders and made smoothies. I don't know about kids these days but I was taught that my work ethic shows through on how I present myself."}
{"text":"My rating is purely based on Tiffany. I had given up on coming to this location but since my preferred location (Sahara/Fort Apache) got closed down, my friend convinced me to try this location again. 

For working by herself every time she works (6pm to close), she had a pleasant attitude, great customer service, and made our order right. I've been to this location multiple times before, during the day/morning, and was never greeted, or if I was, it was a greeting like it was my fault that the employees had to work. On top of that, my order was frequently made wrong and when I'm getting a smoothie to take to work, leaving work to have it fixed isn't the easiest thing to do. 

They definitely need to have 2 people working at night, but, scheduling-wise, Tiffany is the best person to handle nights on her own. 

Thank you, Tiffany, for your hard work and commitment to doing your job well!! :)"}
{"text":"I decided to not listen to the other reviews about the service here and just go anyways because it's just a smoothie. The smoothie was okay, a little watery, but good. The service, though, was indeed poor. I was not greeted when I walked in and the guy who took my order seemed like he hated everything about himself and life. After I ordered, I watched him help another customer and he never made eye contact with her. Looked right past her to look outside. So, out of curiosity, I looked outside to see what was so interesting. Nothing. There was noting happening, not even a car passing by. This is the closest Trop to me by .5 miles, so I'll just go to a different location."}
{"text":"Staff is not as friendly as other locations I've been to but it's a smoothie place so I'm sure customer service is not exactly a priority."}
{"text":"Like their slogan says \"no fried zone\", this is a great plus.  Smoothies are seriously calorie-ific, but if you get it with Splenda vs. turbinado sugar it greatly decreases the calories.  Peanut butter crunch flatbread with honey is my favorite & a must try."}
{"text":"Hit & miss service, great smoothies, but a bit slow. The food looks great & they just added Artisan Tacos. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the Peanut Butter Cup smoothie!"}
{"text":"Worst possible service. They are understaffed and the employees have no hospitality toward their customers. There was one guy working the front and seemingly no one in the back making the food. I watched two customers wait about 10 minutes to have their order taken. I waited about 15-20 minutes for a half sandwich and smoothie which I don't understand because this should be a quick eats place. And it's like their employees have no hospitality or energy for their job, at least try to smile once in awhile."}
{"text":"I've had more than 20+ smoothies here. So when my husband brought me the avocolada it didn't taste right. I called the store to let them know it wasn't made right I was told \"well you can bring it in as evidence and we can make you a new one\" not one I'm sorry for the inconvenience etc. this place is about 5 miles away and I can't just drop what I'm doing to go back and get a new one. What I would have liked the outcome to be was: since you experienced a bad smoothie we would be happy to remake it when can you come back? Normally it's more of a lighter color and creamier. Hopefully when my husbands takes it back it's made correctly. 

Instead I hear....bring it back as evidence so we now your not lying."}
{"text":"Is this place a joke? I walked in 30 minutes before closing and ordered a mocha madness. Is it just me who was not aware of the flavor change? This smoothie had some sort of powdered type shit and at first I thought it was powder that was not blended well. So I ask to remake it and he did, and it was the same. Paying 7 dollars for this, I thought maybe I could go blend some more at home and when I did, the thing that I thought was powder did NOT melt down. It was so nasty and idk if he even knows the recipe.. do yourself a favor and stay away from this place. No wonder why there weren't any customers"}
{"text":"Horrible service. i come here multiple times and have not once did any of their employees have good customer service. they're very rude and dismissive, they make you wait while they talk in the back and the place is always trashed. not once do they clean. poor management hiring incompetent workers"}
{"text":"So I decide to get a smoothie through the drive-thru, I seen a car at the window and one that just placed an order with 4 passengers. So I thought to myself \"this place kinda takes their sweet time with the smoothies as it is, now they're really going to be long\" so I decided to park and walk in. Inside there was a couple waiting for their food, a gentleman at the counter and another couple waiting for their food with their child. The customer infront of me seemed to be waiting to order for about 5 min, none of the employees seemed to have acknowledged him. Then an employee who seemed to come out the restroom walked past us not saying a word or anything like \"one moment, someone will be with you, I apologize for the wait\" nothing she seemed to clock out and leave. I continued to wait more then 5 min so the customer infront of me has been there way longer than me, at thus point we had both become irritated with the wait. We finally get helped no apologies for the shift leader or the lady left in charge. While we waited the the couple without the kid received their food, they ended up return it due to it being wrong. A small family or 3 walk in and place a food & smoothie order, at this point I've been waiting for my smoothie for about 10min. Then some how the family of 3 end up getting their food before me and the customer before me, I then asked the gentleman how long has it been since he had ordered his 1 smoothie and he said \"about 20min.\" So i decided to try and cancel my order as it was taking TOO LONG, I tried to get someone's attention but got distracted with the family of 3 who came back in due to their fruit being rotten & they forgot to give them their smoothies. The shift leader ended up giving them chips only because the young lady customer asked her to give her something. Before I could cancel my order the shift leader had brought my 1 SMOOTHIE that took longer than 20 min to make, she didn't even say sorry it took so long here's some chips or hey 5% discount on a future smoothie nothing, so I asked for the manager and she said they had left for the day. I then asked the shift leader for her corporate office number and she said I had to go online and find it, I had no choice but to take my already made smoothie and leave. I dont know what needs to be done to this establishment in regards to customer service but they need to fix it, because it's not running well at all."}
{"text":"FUhuckkk no. Sorry that is rude. BUT, the wait time for your smoothie is legit like 30 min. When I got my smoothie it tasted like soy milk and ice. No Flavor what so ever. Go to Jamba Juice."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!!!
I'm a loyal customer of Tropical Smoothie but this particular location has absolutely disappointed me.
I'm a very patient person. I don't mind waiting a little while especially if I see that the place is slammed.
there was only three people ahead of me in line and a total of 6 people just hanging out drinking their smoothies and waiting on sandwiches.
I waited a total of 30 minutes for this man to take my drink order. I get he was busy but apparently he was not busy enough to just stand around and speak to the lady that was ordering ahead of me.
after I ordered he promptly put all the ingredients for my smoothie into a blender and proceeded to blend it. when the blender stopped he ran to the back to do who knows what and I sat there staring at my blended smoothie just sit there for about 5 minutes, when he came back from the back he pressed the blend button again and took some other peoples orders, cool, im here seeing my smoothie just melt there.
he finally goes to the blender and presses the blend button yet ANOTHER time.
I finally get my smoothie after being at this place for 45 minutes.
I get into my car RUSHING as my lunch break is an hour long. I take a sip of my smoothie and it is absolutely DISGUSTING! seriously, I ordered a sunrise sunset and got what tasted like pink blended water and ice.
it was way too late to go back and ask them to remake it. I truly did not have another hour to waste.
Highly disappointed. highly recommend you to stay away from this place. might as well starve during lunch instead of trying to get a smoothie."}
{"text":"Slowest tropical smoothie location ever. I was 3rd in line. Got both orders in front of me wrong. Made a hot chick's order intentionally before mine. Took at least 20mins to make my smoothie. They need another body back there, or possibly some employees who at least LOOK like maybe they're on the ball a little bit??!! These two guys are idiots. Corporate needs to get on their ass at this location."}
{"text":"Lousy service. Walked in and ordered and paid for my smoothie. No one else in the joint. THEN cars started going through drive through. They helped all the drive thru peeps while I sat there and waited almost 15 mins for a smoothie. No more visits here. Bye Felicia!"}
{"text":"Very nice and courteous employees work here. But they aren't the sharpest knives in the drawer. During peek times, expect very very slow service even in comparison to other Tropical Smoothies. If you're even slightly in a hurry, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Disorganized location, new Manager needs further training/termination.  They were totally out of chicken!  It's amazing the franchise does nothing about this location that always has issues when I come."}
{"text":"The food and service is great!

I patronize TSC multiple times a week...."}
{"text":"Great prices for smoothies but THE LINE IN THE DRIVE THRU IS ABSOLUTELY SUPER SLOW! at this location or i'd give it a higher review."}
{"text":"I usually go to the one on W. Tropicana and Decatur and order the same thing, the Sunrise Sunset smoothie. This one did NOT taste the same. I agree with all the negative reviews. Taste isn't consistent, front counter was deserted and you could hear employees talking in the back, floor and counter were dirty and sticky. They really need a visit from the health department."}
{"text":"Tropical smoothie is my favorite quick healthy spot. Sad to say this is the worst location in Las Vegas. Customer service is not up to par. Seems like the employees can care less about the quality of the food. Been served a smoothie only 80% full and a already opened bag of chips. They've mixed up my order a few times. Seems like a managing issue. I would love to see this place improve."}
{"text":"I ordered the smoothie and sandwich combo -  the peanut smoothie with whey and the cranberry chicken salad sandwich.  It was filling and affordable.  A satisfying post-workout meal.  Still probably high in calories but made me feel good."}
{"text":"Great for a fast lunch! Love love the smoothie selection. I'm trying the avacolada today! Its packed with flavor. :) 

Service is kinda slow and they always mess up my order at the drive thru speaker but it's always delivered correct at the window. Thank goodness Never been inside."}
{"text":"Upon arriving the worker was counting his bank at the register which is no problem. I'm patient to wait. Worker did not look up and greet me for few mins, I was the only customer there.  He then says hi and tells other guy to take my order. 30 secs later They take my order and get started on making it.  I ordered peanut paradise smoothie and California flat bread. They never asked what protein I wanted so I ask if it could be made with whey.  They don't ask for payment and I'm just standing there for couple mins more.   Finally come to take payment and total comes out to $11.50ish.   I ask if they don't do the combo anymore as I have been charged this price for flat bread smoothie combo past 3 times.   He says oops sorry he forgot to make it a \"combo\". Pay the correct price and sit to wait for food.  Brings food out and I notice without taking a bite that the flat bread is missing avacado.  I bring it to the worker and ask if it was supposed to have avacado.   He says sorry he forgot it. Asked me if I want him To remake or just add on top.   Being hungry by now I say just add.   He then brings out a half avacado out of A fridge or freezer unwrapped. Looked extremely brown.  I watch him scrape most of the bad avacado off and proceeds to add on top and smash it into the rest of the flatbread.  Wraps it up and returns it to me.  I take a bite and the avacado is extremely cold and tastes like freezer air, watery in texture.  Being tired of the bad service I just scraped as much of the avacado off as I could and extremely disappointingly ate the flatbread and left never wanting to return again.    This has not been the first incident I have had here.  Many times since opening actually.  And most times I avoid this location.  It's getting to the point I never want to eat at any tropical smoothie any more.   Stay away from this one!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in at tropical smoothie on mcdowell, as soon as we walked in it stunk so bad of vomit that we told them we couldn't stay and why. They only said Okay sorry.  This place is dirty, stinky and always takes a very long time to get food or smoothies.. We have been there several times before, but will not return because of the filth and stink."}
{"text":"Great owner. Good selection, including veggie smoothies. Will make customizations for you."}
{"text":"I have gone to this location several times and never had any issue. However,  Last week I went and they only had ONE person working there. Their employee was charging and cooking everyone's meals by himself.  so It took me 35 min just to get a smoothie.  the place was not that busy, but even then one person couldn't handle all of the orders. I was very dissapointed on their management style as they were so understuffed
their smoothies are ok, they also offer healthier options. on their good things is that  if you sign up for  e-mails offers you will get a free smoothie on your b-day and several discounts almost every month."}
{"text":"Wow!! Great smoothies here, and also great sandwiches and wraps. Very healthy. The environment was nice and quiet when I walked in. The place is very clean. The staff member's here are friendly. 

They have FREE WIFI!! Perfect if you want to get some work done. I got a chicken wrap and it was delicious!"}
{"text":"It was good just didn't like how the cashier didn't ask what size and gave me the biggest one there was which ended up being a little too much for one person"}
{"text":"We appreciated Jeff's excellent customer service and great persona.  We will make sure to come back during graveyard when he is making smoothies."}
{"text":"This is a smaller than usual Tropical Smoothie Cafe with as little as 4 tables and 1 single-unit bathroom. Mind you, their bathroom has no vent so that's one thing to note! 

My galpal, Candy and I were set to do some research on good picnic grounds in the Las Vegas area for my birthday (which is tomorrow, but we plan to go on a picnic next week) so all we needed was a strong wi-fi network (and she assured me that Tropical Smoothis was 'student friendly') and some good ol' brain food. After a quick examination of the menu, we both settled for a couple of flatbreads - Honey Ham & Swiss for her and Chicken Pesto for me. For $3.99 (that's $4.13 with tax), we were filled up pretty well. Top that with a chocolate chip cookie (roughly 0$0.60 each) and we had our cherry top for the night. 

We had a good time chit-chatting if only it weren't for the cackling blender in the background that grumbled abruptly every now and then, it had us jump a little every time. But other than that, I wouldn't entirely suggest this place for a hang-out as much as it is a stop-order-&-go branch. Friendly service and good food nonetheless."}
{"text":"Health is wealth and if you're a health buff like me, you may want to try this place out. My friends and I needed some time to relax after our first class and decided to take a break from McDonalds and hang out here instead. It was fine and dandy and had an 'Einstein Bros Bagel' feel to it. 

I ordered a Jamaican Jerk Chicken Wrap and a Sunny Day Smoothie (to brighten up myself from the gloomy weather outside) For my sides, I chose the Sour Cream and Onion flavored baked lays potato chips. Despite the spiciness of the JJC Wrap - spicy food are my mortal enemies - I actually liked the flavor it had and would recommend it to anyone who's willing to be adventerous and try something new. Our next dish to try is the Buffalo Chicken and the Totally Turkey. 

Of all the things I wished this place had, it would be different sized smoothie cups. I had a feeling my order would be too much for me to even finish and I was right. My 2 friends had to help me devour the remaining wrap and I went on to sip at the smoothie the rest of the day. 

Toodloo McDonalds. Won't be visiting you for awhile."}
{"text":"While I absolutely LOVE Tropical Smoothie Cafe, and I usually LOVE this location; it has its problems.  While the service is great and comes with a smile, the fact that over half of the menu was unavailable this weekend due to managerial neglect bothers me!  
If the manager isn't going to be here to take care of the store (and customer complaints) they should at least make sure the employees have everything needed to complete customer satisfaction.  Including, but not limited to FOOD!
There are not enough Tropical Smoothies in the East Valley, but before we go adding anymore maybe we should perfect the ones we do have!!
The one off Stapley has questionable managerial leadership as well. But that's for another Yelp! Review to disclose."}
{"text":"Since my last review in 2015 this location has gotten worse. They always run out of food and drive-thru can be 20-40 minute wait. Once I got to the window to pay to find out they didn't even start my smoothie and i waited 30 minutes! I asked if they were almost done and they said they didn't even start it yet so i said No Thank you and took off. Several times they've gotten my order wrong. I go to the drive-thru because I am in a hurry and don't have time to wait around but you better hope no one is behind you if you wanna back out. I stopped coming here, they have disappointed me to no end.
This location should just shut down it's been two years and has not shown any signs of improvement."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I DONT WRITE REVIEWS BUT I SIMPLY HAD TO FOR THIS PLACE. 
To the people managing this location, what are you guys doing?? I came here on June 24th, 2017 at 10pm to a chaotic situation. The person you had working that night was new and she did not know a thing that was going on. Her line was backed up and had some RANDOM DUDE NOT IN UNIFORM helping her out. Furthermore your employee who you had working that night kept complaining how they left her and talking about how the managers tricked her into staying. Did I mention that her phone was charging NEXT TO WHERE SHE WAS MAKING OUR DRINKS. 
FOR THE PEOPLE GOING HERE, don't. Just don't. Go to another one. IT TOOK ME 25 MINUTES TO GET A PROTEIN SMOOTHIE."}
{"text":"This place is the WORST! Unless you want to wait an hour for a smoothie don't bother. Whenever I come in they only have 2 employees working. Seriously the owner of this place should be ASHAMED!!"}
{"text":"Good smoothies but they only come in one size (16 oz) which is actually a lot of smoothie. Next time I'm just ordering a kids one.  But on the upside the smoothies are great and the place is clean."}
{"text":"These people have the BEST smoothies ever they always have good service . One time they gave me a small smoothie and a cookie for my little son (he's 2 years old) for free!!!. THANK YOU SO MUCH !!!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place no stars, I would. There are 11 people sitting waiting for food...every single person here isn't eating, just waiting. The service is TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"As we approached this store, we noticed 3 kids smoking outside on the bench.  One of the kids worked for this location so as she saw me walk in she and her friends threw their cigarettes and she walked in a bit upset.  She took my order, 2 smoothies, and quickly closed the transaction.  She took a while to get the smoothies which was odd since I was the only customer. As I waited outside with my family who ordered pizza next door, I noticed the big poster on the door that says \"Happy hour 5-7, buy 2 get 1 free smoothie\".  So I went back inside and had to wait a little since she was making smoothies and flatbreads for another customer.  As I approached the register I had told her about the poster and she said I'd have to order a new set because my transaction is closed.  I asked, why she didn't tell me I get a free smoothie since I bought 2 smoothies during happy hour? She said, I can't tell you that. The other customers and I looked at eachother and chuckled.  Like really?! Am I was supposed to tell her what her employer is advertising? It's like me going to happy hour at a bar and they charge me full price cause I didn't remind them it's happy hour.  Ridiculous service which is why they have a 2 star. I wish I could give no stars.  This place sucks!! Don't come here.  Their smoothies don't taste good either but since it's the only one on anthem, I didn't have a choice.  But after this, I'll drive 10 min to the one down the street."}
{"text":"The owner of this tropical smoothie cafe should be ashamed of themselves it's always 1 person working the lines are always long and then management do not care"}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep coming here oh probably the drive Thur any way..... I think this will be my last until I hear of new owners or staff.... because currently they could care less on how to treat their customers.  I'm never returning to this location ever again its still horrible"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best locations in Vegas yet. They have a drive thru for your convenience, the inside makes you feel like you're in California by the beach, not to mention it's very spacious and the staff is very polite and friendly (which is nice for a change).

Definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I went in for a quick bite and they ended up losing my card. There were only two employees no managers and they couldn't even provide me with info on who to call regarding an issue like this.
I will say that the employees were very nice but how are you going to lose a card on a simple quick transaction."}
{"text":"I had ordered from Tropical Smoothie Cafe through the Tapingo app and had my order delivered to me an embarrassingly number of times before finally making a visit to the restaurant earlier this year haha.

Although I would probably not say the food here is as healthy as it is marketed to be, it is probably healthier than many other fast food restaurants, and they have a decent array of sandwiches, flatbreads and wraps in addition to their smoothies. In terms of smoothies, I particularly like the health nut smoothie here (made from blueberries, mango, protein powder), especially because it gives me the extra boost in protein intake. I also recently tried the orange ginger glow (made from mango, ginger, green apple, pineapple, carrot, and orange juice), which was really refreshing and tasty! (Imagine a fresh-pressed juice, but in smoothie form.) Their smoothies are pricey ($5+), but they are served in a large 24 oz cup, so it's a pretty decent value for the price! 

They do have some tables and chairs for you to dine in at, but I think Tropical Smoothie Cafe is more of a grab-and-go kind of option for me personally. Another plus for this place is that service is quick, so it's a great choice if you're looking for something quick!"}
{"text":"Not only did it take forever for us to get two smoothies but the customer service was horrible! Waited 5 minutes for someone to come to the window. No hello. They just asked for our money & handed us our smoothies. Really unhappy with my experience. Only positive is that we got what we ordered."}
{"text":"The Tropical Smoothie Cafe inside Red Rock Casino at the food court. Its one of those places you just come to get a quick drink, or kill some time before the movie starts.

Prices appear to be slightly higher than other locations, $1.50 for some drinks, making the drinks $6.50 for some before you add any extras. I guess you got to pay more for being inside a casino and by a theater. 

Order. Pay. Wait. Drink. Enjoy. Nothing exciting or bad about this place."}
{"text":"i dont get how this location always seems like the employees are working at no faster than turtle pace. there's a line, 2 employees, 4 blenders? but only ONE drink going at a time. and when that ONE drink is done it sits there...

when i got here, as i was about to walk in an old man walked out upset and said \"how can you run a business like this!?\" 


maybe he was having a bad day but this location has really gone down in the past year."}
{"text":"Michale is one of the best employees out here in NV. He always has a great attitude, is attentive and makes amazing drinks and really listens even when my order is more complicated then need be lol. He always tells us to have a blessed night and I couldn't be happier with him! HES A KEEPER YALL. TSC you won"}
{"text":"I just love this place.  Delicious, healthy smoothies and wraps.

I tend to forget about it due to the somewhat hidden location, and the hours aren't that great."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to try TSC, considering I live across the street. Several years later I finally made it a point to pick up a wrap since I had a coupon for a wrap and a side. 

Upon entering, it just seemed really dark inside. I was not really greeted at all, just a frowny faced young girl waiting to take my order. I placed my order to-go then grabbed a seat to wait. The wrap was made fairly quickly. 

I did not check it before leaving because she was seriously not friendly and I'm pretty sure bad things would've happened if I asked for something else or god forbid something with the order was wrong. When I got out to my automobile I happened to notice I was not given the side item I had chosen.. Again - NOPE, not going back inside just to get a small bag of chips with that sort of poor customer service.

I take good customer service seriously and something such as that will steer me to a competitor.

I do have to say, though, the jerk chicken wrap was very tasty. (Which probably helped bump this review from 2 to 3 stars)

I did not purchase a smoothie so I cannot comment on that part of the business."}
{"text":"Came for happy hour (5pm-7pm) which was buy two 24oz (4.99) and get the third one for free. Got blueberry bliss, paradise point, and Bahama Mama for meh. Soooo good! Was definitely happy."}
{"text":"I normally go to the Tropical Smoothie on Blue Diamond but went here today because we where in the area....this place was trashed! They where out of everything, the menu boards had fallen off, and when I got my wrap it had about a half a cup of un-melted cheese. I'll stick to my blue diamond location."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend the other day for lunch. The place itself looks a little...meh. Torn seats, overflowing trash cans, not a fan of the colors. The guy at the counter seemed slightly annoyed at me taking a minute to decide what I want (my first time) then seem blatantly p'd off at us that he rang our orders up together when they were meant to be separate. But I work a counter position too so I get that sometimes you're just having a long day, no big deal but it did damper my experience.

I got a smoothie (pomegranate paradise or something? I don't remember) and a veggie humus wrap. The smoothie was BOMB. And huge! It was so delicious and I really enjoyed every sip of it. If you're looking for just that I would totally recommend this place. 

The veggie hummus wrap was mediocre. WAY too much hummus (words a vegetarian like myself barely ever says) It wasn't mixed up very well at all so half of the wrap was pure hummus-y mush and the rest as just layers of the different components. I wasn't too pleased with it so I ended up only eating half of it. Luckily I was full from that amazing nectar we are calling a smoothie. 

Long story short, I wouldn't write this place off quite yet. I'm hesitant to try another wrap or sandwich but I would hit it up for a smoothie sometime in the summer."}
{"text":"I am surprised by the low ratings for this TSC! I have becoming here almost daily and it's impressive to see the young staff busting their ass. The drive Thru is a nightmare, but be it luck or not, my orders have always been perfect. The smoothies can definitely be made with less ice and sugar, but that's just my preference and when requested they nail it. The loaded spinach salad is top notch as is the totally turkey wrap. As for the reviews claiming fruit smoothies range in taste each time, I attribute it to Mother Nature. I advise ordering smoothies with seasonal fruits and even then no 2 fruits taste identical rendering each smoothie slightly unique."}
{"text":"Good place to get a nice smoothie during a very hot day and hang around with family & friends."}
{"text":"I've never been here before but I'm sure glad I did. The owner is very friendly and super helpful. We ordered food to go for our office and was very pleased. Chocolate chip cookies are delicious. 

I got the peaches and silk smoothie which has peaches, strawberries and banana. It was so good!! Very filling too. It had the right amount of ingredients! Everyone that got a smoothie really enjoyed it! 

I got the baha flat bread with chicken and it was good! Had peppers and red onions in it with a southwest ranch sauce. Bread was soft and fluffy. I will definitely come back here again!

Next time I'm gonna try the jerk chicken wrap!"}
{"text":"So sad that u go there and the man takes upon himself to take a break and close the store down. All the tropical smoothies are going down the employees are not train for customer service me and others customers saw him sitting down eating and the door was close we just can not believe this how they have this. Business open. And the other person told me this is not the frist time so we just left who wants to order a small thing when the person doesn't even want to work"}
{"text":"If I could give this location a negative 100 stars I would!

I placed an order from UberEats since they popped up on my \"30 mins and under\" category. However, it literally took them 1.5 hours to fulfill my order. My Uber delivery driver literally waited there for 45 mins, along with other drivers and customers.

Come to find out, the manager/owner decided that it's a smart idea to leave his first-day-on-the-job employee handling the store by herself.  It's definitely neither her nor my delivery driver's fault. It was the manager/owner's lack of care and business sense.

To make the whole experience worst, my order was wrong and tasted horrific. I did not receive the chips I ordered and the sandwich came with almost no grilled chicken at all.

I've always had issues with this location. They either mess up the order or the restaurant just plain dirty or there's literally 1 employee handling the whole store.

This manager/owner doesn't deserve to be a part of this franchise, it truly is a shame...!!

STAY AWAY!"}
{"text":"I love that this location next to me has a drive-thru! Easy to get a smoothie without getting the baby out of the car. The visit today was extra special! My toddler had a fever and wouldn't take popsicles and needed something good and refreshing. Kelani helped me get exactly what I needed for her. She had a good recommendation and the perfect size for her! 

Thank you for your help, Kelani! We'll be back to see you!"}
{"text":"The smoothies and wraps are great! Customer service not so much. They only had two ppl working during lunch hour and the cashier didn't seem to know much about the menu."}
{"text":"It's pretty bad when the gentleman working simply explains he's actually a little to busy to take my order.. he also advised that maybe I should go somewhere else if in a hurry.. I was, so I did.. thanks brother"}
{"text":"This is literally the worst tropical smoothie I have EVER been in I am literally here at 1030pm with no one ordering inside because its closed and no one in the drive thru yet I have been waiting 15 minutes for him to take my order this is complete BS and I'm pissed..."}
{"text":"All the tropical smoothies in this area are so slow and you end up waiting more than 20ish minutes even if you are the only person there with one smoothie order......Why doesn't management do anything about this? Store manager? District manager? What's going on with all these locations? They are terrible."}
{"text":"Marvice should learn how to smile !! The reason why there's no tips in her bucket . No thank you nothing at all. Bad customer service !"}
{"text":"This place has been \"out of coffee\" for the last two weeks. Why don't you just take the mocha madness off the menu? That's all I'm wanting and you still don't have it. A bit ridiculous. Currently sitting in the Starbucks drive thru since you can't get your act together"}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!!!!!!!! Carla is the rudest most disrespectful person I've ever dealt with! Well she said her name was Carla but the receipt says her name is Viotta! She's was giving me a lot of attitude while taking my order and kept saying she couldn't hear me. I seriously repeated my order 6-7 times to her and when I got to the window I asked for a large ice water because it's 116 degrees and she gave me a small cup, HALF WAY FILLED WITH NO ICE! Never coming back! I placed a $40 order and this is how I get treated?"}
{"text":"I love tropical smooth.. Especially over jamba. I've been to many locations (not close to home). When I found out this location was opening I couldn't help the excitement knowing it was so close to home. Unfortunately, this location sucks! Mainly the time efficiency... I've never been inside. The times I've been here I go to the drive-thru. It's literally a 10 min wait or sometimes more. The team needs better management and training on working faster. Customer service is great in friendliness but dammit give me my smoothy in time before it turns into water!"}
{"text":"I ordered two smoothies, three groups that came after me with several orders were served first.  Every time I've been here there has been some kind of \"issue\"."}
{"text":"Second time coming to this location. Some of the slowest service imaginable. But at least the smoothie taste good."}
{"text":"Amazing that this place has 2 stars. I've been standing here waiting for someone to take my order for at least 15 minutes and nothing.

Now to be fair I can see they only have two employees and it's super busy so technically the slow service is more of a staffing issue. But devils advocate here. Neither of the employees has even acknowledged that I'm standing here. One employee has made 4 food orders and she has not said a word to me. The other is making smoothies and has finished 7 and said nothing to me either while I stand at the register.

I feel bad for the employees. You can tell they are short staffed and slammed with orders. I don't think it's their fault. I can only imagine if I was working here how tired I'd be at 2pm when I've been here all day on the first triple digit heat day of the year for Vegas.

Hopefully the owner sees this and decides to staff more people?  Actually who am I kidding. This place has two stars for a reason.

First time ever I wish Yelp let me give 0 stars."}
{"text":"So for a first time user of this place it was terrible.  They have a coupon on yelp for 15 percent off at this location and then they told me they don't honor it. They only honor it in Tempe.  I don't see why they would put the coupon on yelp if they are not going to honor it. Then they were very slow after that. I won't be coming back"}
{"text":"I've been to Jamba Juice and I never like it. I'm not sure what they put in their smoothies because it always tastes bitter, grainy, and tastes like diet food. But at Tropical Smoothie it's always a flavor explosion of goodness in my mouth. I did learn a long time ago that I've never cared for TS' s food, so this review is solely based on their smoothies...although maybe they've made some changes in the last 15 years and I should try it...  Anyhow! Going to Tropical Smoothie, for me, is a rare treat and not something I do on a regular basis, 1) because I'm almost never near one, and 2) like coffee, it can get pricey.  So with that in mind, I couldn't care less how annoying the staff is. As long as my smoothie is mouthgasmic those rowdy, bored looking teens can do whatever they want. My favorites are the Peanut Butter Cup, Bahama Mama, Sunrise Sunset, Paradise Point, Beach Bum, TropiColada, and Pineapple Delight. Yum yum! I hope to never see Tropical Smoothie go out of business because their smoothies truly are the best ones I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Summer is upon us, and a smoothie is a great way to get a bit of relief from the heat.  There's plenty of Tropical Smoothie Cafe's through out the valley, but I'm not sure if they are all exactly the same.  Some details for this particular location:

Happy hour 5pm-7pm daily, second smoothie is $1.99.
Free wifi
Outdoor shaded seating
Open 24 hours

All of these things make for decent alternative to studying or working from your laptop at home."}
{"text":"The service is very very slow at this location. I have given them multiple attempts and in all cases they have let me down. If you want to use this location be prepared to spend the day!"}
{"text":"I have to say this is the worst Tropical Smoothie in town. When you hire kids that don't care about their jobs it shows. I ordered two different  sandwiches through drive though and one with their apple slaw. I also ordered a smoothie but it was so watered down and gross I took two sips and threw it down my sink. When I opened the bag they gave me two of the same sandwich which is not what I ordered and the apple slaw had old brown apples in it and I had to throw that out as well. 

Gross food and bad smoothies. I can't see them being here for long once people start reading their Yelp reviews. A lot of other customers have had bad experiences as well. This is a nice area, why the heck can't we get some decent food and service is beyond me. Please close down so a better restaurant can come to our nice neighborhood."}
{"text":"Worst location ever! Every time I go there they mess up my order or it takes 20+ min... I just went there and they messed up one of my smoothies. Called 6 times and no answer. Won't be coming back and hope other people won't go there either."}
{"text":"The best veggie wrap!!! The flavor is fabulous!
Great in portion, its perfect :)"}
{"text":"No avocados! Bummer. Pulled up to the drive-thru and the chick wasn't very friendly. I asked for the Avocolada and instead of saying something like that, \" I'm sorry, we are out of avocados, is there something else we can make you.\" I got an,\" We can't make that, we're out of avocados\" in a not-so friendly tone. These younger ladies need to learn some manners."}
{"text":"Tropical smoothie is one of my favorite go to places. I always get health nut with soy protein instead. My family has tried almost everything. Everything is good except the sandwiches are smaller than expected. Every tropical smoothie is a franchise, therefore, happy hours and hours of operation varies. This location is the one I go to the most. Happy hour is from 5-7p.m. and it's buy 1 get 1 for $1.99. Tropical smoothie is a Vegas local spot. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Hands down, consistently, the worst service I've gotten in Summerlin for the three years I've lived here. Actually it's not Summerlin. However, the drive through service is so bad. I keep coming back due to lack of options in the area."}
{"text":"Always love dropping by this location when I'm in town! It's always super clean and fresh, which equals trustworthy in my books. The health nut smoothie was spectacular with a delicious nutty hint of flavor. Parking is also never a problem since it's connected to a strip mall."}
{"text":"I never was a smoothie guy until I set foot in this place. Many lunches and free smoothie coupons later, I now crave that sweet, slushy goodness day and night. I'm beginning to sweat just thinking about when I can get my next fix. And so many options, too. Whatever type of cold fruit concoction you want, TSC has it. Kiwi, Banana, Passion fruit, you name it, they got it. Do you want protein powder in your smoothie? Boom, done. You want the milk from a rare Tibetan mountain goat in your smoothie? They probably have that too. How about no sugar? Yup, that can happen.

And in case they didn't have enough to keep you coming back, they also offer a smoothie club cup and punch card, which is basically the crack pipe of the smoothie world. Next they'll probably offer a seat where you can mainline their blended mixtures straight into your bloodstream.

But seriously, I heavily rely on this place for my lunchtime rotation. Not sure I'd go out of my way to go here, but I'm really glad it's within walking distance of my office. If you've got one close by and are looking for a new addiction, stop by and see what it's all about."}
{"text":"I ordered via drive thru and I was the only customer... when I got to the window they asked me to repeat order...10 minutes later another person came and asked what  I ordered...10 more minutes later they attempted to give me something totally different , then got upset when I said it wasnt my order.  After 30 minutes I left with nothing.  Will not return."}
{"text":"This location is ok. It's kinda small, the portions for the sandwiches etc aren't that great... the smoothies are excellent though. Friendly staff... it only loses a star for how tiny it is inside. Barely any room to sit anywhere if there's like 3-4 people in."}
{"text":"I must so say  in all of my experiences with tropical smoothie.  this by far is the worst one yet. The service through the drive thru lane was incredible slow. I don't see there being a reason for it being as slow as it is. The workers are worse. My dog would be a better fit then they are. They are extremely rude to you for no reason. They always look like they hate life.  Like I said before my service dog can do a better job them then."}
{"text":"Everytime I come into this place they have new people working so it just goes to show you the fast turn around. Feel sorry for the owners phones never answered just went into this location this morning waited over 3 minutes for someone to come take my order and the kid who finally came around from the bathrooms was on his cell. I was so turned off I left. No manager apparently there either again feel sorry for the owners and the staff they hired taking away money from their pockets. GO TO THE LOCATION ON BLUE DIAMOND!! worth the drive !!"}
{"text":"I think this was one of the worst smoothies of my life. I got the green detox smoothie and I'm pretty sure there was half a bag of poorly chopped up ginger, it just tasted so horrible my mouth was actually stinging. My sister got the blueberry bliss and it was just blended blueberries and water. It legit tasted like blueberry flavored water with dyed sawdust to give some texture. I would never come here again and I hope they go out of business because no one deserves to taste what I have tasted not even the devil himself."}
{"text":"I was super excited that this location was 24 hours so I could grab a smoothie and a salad after my nightly work out. I got my salad to go. When I got home, I took a couple of bites of my salad and looked down and saw a dead fly in my salad. I am disgusted and never coming back to this location. UGH."}
{"text":"Came here a few months ago for the first time because I wanted a smoothie and there wasn't a Jamba Juice around so I thought I would give it a try. I can't remember what I got but it was a green smoothie and it was good. 

The only thing I don't like is that they only have one size for the smoothies and the cup is huge. It's too big for me and I couldn't finish it, I had to save the rest for later."}
{"text":"Always understaffed and slow. The food and smoothies are good but I often wait over 10 min to get my food after waiting 5-10 just to place my order. I use to come here 2-3 times a week for my work lunch but I won't be coming anymore since I can't wait that long"}
{"text":"Toasted toasted toasted. Word of the day for sure. The toasted wraps are awesome. I went with the Thai Chicken and it was a great combo with wontons, chicken and a Thai sauce that had nice heat. Perhaps a little too much sauce overall. Side choices include chips, a banana or an apple. You also get a smoothie for $3 with a food purchase which is the way to go. The smoothie was not as good as Carolina Smoothies but better than The King for sure. 

Parking can be a hassle of course but you probably figured that out based on the address."}
{"text":"With no other customers before me, and three workers that I could see, this place is too expensive to have such slow service! The owner should keep an eye on these slow, unmotivated workers! SMH"}
{"text":"How are these stores still open?!? I swore I'd never come to one again and here I am, with yet another crappy experience! Is there any customer service training or do they let their employees wing it?!? Dirty tables and it's not even busy (no surprise)! I had called customer support once for the one by my house and she was really friendly and seemingly accommodating, but didn't hear back and don't they did anything about that terrible location! Back to this location, their motto should be service with a sneer!  It's 11:20 am and I'm the only customer in the place, no wonder. So it's safe to say it's over, again!"}
{"text":"Tropical smoothie cafe is my favorite smoothie spot in Tempe. They use actual fruit for their smoothies which is nice compared to somewhere like one-stop and its more affordable then other places. The food is good and have a decent amount of choices . they also handle customization well. The workers are always friendly but what other reviewers say is true this place is almost always under staffed. So if you want to come in be sure to habe a fee minutes in case theres a few people there . the workers work hard the place just doesnt staff enough. I just plan ahead and when i come i make sure I'm not in a hury. You can also call ahead an order though"}
{"text":"Fast drive through and very friendly employees. They have never screwed up my order and the food is fresh and tasty. The quality is consistent and I have no complaints. I have my favorites here which are the Hawaiian Breeze smoothie and the Thai Chicken salad."}
{"text":"It was only 11pm, waited at the drive thru about 10 minutes with no response. Drove around to the window and saw no one inside. Saw another car go around to the drive thru so I followed behind. After about 5 minutes they drove to the window, I watched them wait there at the window for a few minutes waiting for service then ended up leaving all of their trash on the drive thru ledge obviously pissed off. So sad, I wanted a smoothie so bad (apparently I wasn't the only one!) and it wasn't even late! After reading other reviews maybe it was a good thing no one was there since apparently I would have had to wait a long time anyways."}
{"text":"Stop what ever you are doing right now and go get yourself a cali chicken flatbread sandwich immediately!! Its definitely an emergency because it is only for a limited time. If you like avocado you'll love it!! Trust me!"}
{"text":"Very good smoothies. Also has good, healthy food. The staff is friendly, but can be a little on the slow side. Only a little seating inside."}
{"text":"ERIC WAS AWESOME! There were literally 6 people ahead of me, and 3 came in after I ordered. Poor guy was the ONLY one there! Though it's the late/overnight shift, it gets busy! So...GET HIM SOME HELP!! He was working so hard with such poise. Way to not crumble under pressure! Will definitely be back! =)"}
{"text":"Leah helped me this morning and answered ALLLLL my random questions! Island Green was already my favorite...but knowing I can get it without sugar made my day! YOU'RE AWESOME! Can't wait to put my mug into use! Have an incredible day!! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Every once and a while I get a craving for a strawberry smoothie. This location was on my way home and I couldn't resist getting a drink! It was a hot day and the sound of a cold, refreshing smoothie just sounded great. I ordered in the drive thru. The employee took my order quickly and I pulled up. Paid for my drink and quickly received my cup of delight. I drove off with a smile on my face. Sadly by the time I got home my drink was gone but that's a compliment to the maker and recipe! Summer is here and I'm sure I'll be back for another refreshing drink!"}
{"text":"As much as I would love to give this Tropical smoothie a good review I cant.  I've given it a few tries and after my last visit I will definitely not waste my time coming here again.

They're drive thru takes way too long, granted they offer sandwiches and eraps, no other food place takes this long for the drive thru.

This last visit I decided to go inside since I saw 4 cars in the drive thru.  As I went in, I was not greeted by anyone and it wasn't like my presence wasn't unnoticeable since I was standing right at the registers.  The 2 female associates making the smoothies saw me but didnt say anything, they could've greeted at least.  As I stood and waited another associate Miro? Came to the front, looked at me, and went to the back again.  NO ACKNOWLEDGEMENT.  

I was finally able to put my order in once the associate came back to the front, counted an existing register, and had a glance at their phone.

Im pretty frustrated with the service and the wait time, as Ive been sitting here long enough to write a negative review.  Working in the customer service industry I know places have poor customer service, but this place is pretty pathetic.  I guess to sum it all up, whether you choose drive thru or in store, both options you will receive the same customer \"service\" & wait time."}
{"text":"I was not impressed. While my smoothie had potential, it tasted completely watered down. Overpriced for the quality."}
{"text":"So since I am tired of being ridiculed every time I go in this place for ordering the Beyond Meat chicken wrap, I will not be returning.
The first time I laughed it off, but when it happened AGAIN, thats when I had it. Of course it was after I already had paid, so I couldn't just walk out. The gentlemen there, one I am pretty sure is a manager, the other the cashier, calling my food, \"fake, gross, rubber, smells weird.\" Not only is it making your customer feel akward and embarressed you are making fun of them (for choosing to eat soy instead of animal flesh none the less) but it is incredibly unprofessional and odd that you are critisizing your own product.
One of the men had never even tried it but said it was disgusting. Well I find torturing, killing and the smell of animal flesh disgusting. I ordered the beyond meat chicken and he rudely said... \"Oh yeah you mean the FAKE chicken?\" 
I didn't ask for your input.
I will go to Green, 24 carrots or Pomegranite Cafe where there are nice, professional people there who don't make their customers feel like shit.
You guys will go out of business eventually because you are horrible at your job.







Thank you guys so much for service beyond meat chicken for us vegetarians!
It can be vegan friendly if you remove all the cheese and sauces but then I imagine it would be very bland, just like chicken and a wrap with tomatoes.

But for vegetarians you can pretty much make any item that way by substituting the beyond meat chicken!

The buffalo chicken wrap is delicious and inexpensive.

I don't recommend coming during peak hours.

The staff has always been pretty quick with my order but I don't go right at lunch or dinner time."}
{"text":"The black guy working today (11/6) is a total asshole. If you are going to be a dick, don't bother coming to work. He didn't even acknowledge us as we waited for five minutes to order a smoothie, he was so put off by our request to modify a smoothie, rolled his eyes, just a total smartass... customer service can make or break you and living across the street from this location, I would have loved to make it a frequent stop, no thank you."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst tropical smoothie location with the worst customer service no line in the drive-through yet it still takes 3 minutes for them to even greet you.. getting up to the window see four employees standing there all on their phones wait over 10 minutes to get one smoothie."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times & yesterday was one of those times. They were busy too. I was distracted, intending on running next door to Game Stop for my son. Placed my order for an Avocalada & Peanut Butter Cup Smoothie, tipped the folks & left w/my receipt to take care of my next errand. When I got back several minutes  later, they were still busy & our smoothies were still not ready. So I stood there waiting to the left of the register & what do I see??! A Health Dept rating of \"C\" posted on their wall behind said register! Dated March 17, 2016! 

Listen...I've worked in the F&B / Hospitality industry for more years than I care to admit to. So I know what goes on in kitchens. Plus I'm always checking out the \"Dirty Dining\" segments on KTNV. Which makes it kind of hard sometimes to just go out & eat for me. So when a place I've always enjoyed  or looked forward to going to has something like this or worse happen WHILE I'M THERE...it's so upsetting! 

I didn't have my phone on me...I'd left it in my truck...otherwise I'd have snapped a picture of the posted grade. I'm also not the type to make a scene. & there  were people there enjoying their lunches. So I just quietly took my smoothies & left. Didn't even ask for a refund. But my enjoyment in having the treat was gone. I tossed our smoothies & we walked across the parking lot to Subway. I checked their Health Dept rating before we ordered though. Posted \"A\"...."}
{"text":"Staff is rude and inconsistent. Smoothie have become subpar and lumpy. I keep saying this is my last visit but this will be my last visit. If i could rate negative stars i would. Just felt like i wasted my money."}
{"text":"There definitely is a bit of a wait when it's busy, which is not as often as some of the reviewers are leading on.. I come often and every staff member is super nice. If you don't want to wait call ahead and your order will be ready when you get there."}
{"text":"This was SO disappointing? I have never had an issue with a Tropical Smoothie store But this one... Is just horrible. I ordered a wrap, and I don't think I had more than a couple pieces of chicken in the whole thing. He slapped on the sauces and it leaked all over the place and I might as well have ad a lettuce enchilada. It was pathetic. My smoothie was runny , not thick like normal. I will NEVER go to this branch again. Maybe they can hire some people that actually care about their job. You certainly pay enough for their items. Unreal."}
{"text":"Went to TSC this afternoon, Loved it, had a Detox Island Green and it was wonderful... My Son had a Blimey Limey & it was good as well... This is a great treat for your body & a good break from regular fast food...   Also was glad to hear they have Gluten free options, Will have to try some of the meals next time..."}
{"text":"Has been much better last 3 times I've been there. Stayed away about 6 months and it's quite different now. Inside is very sparse, has been cleaned out.  Smoothies were good and service good too. Hope they sorted out whatever problems they had"}
{"text":"I probably spend about an hour in the drive thru and it makes me so mad because i love tropical smoothie on the go. I am also convinced that the people who work here hate their jobs because i always receive bad attitude from them ."}
{"text":"Horrible service! I was the only one in the drive-through line and it took 20 minutes to make a smoothie. Why would it take so long there is no one else in line??? I would not even give this a one star but that was the only option... if it was up to me it would be zero*"}
{"text":"This by far is the worst Tropical Smoothie ever. I've given them many chances and they keep failing every time. They are always under staffed and the staff is so annoyed they ignore you. Not clean, needs maintenance, lightbulbs out, terrible consistency in food and smoothies. There was a party going on in there last time and I waited over 20 minutes. When I pulled up the music was up loud and their cursing throwing their hands in the air being stupid. The owner from lvblvd and warm springs should come over here and have a boot camp. They were out of protein too."}
{"text":"Good food, great smoothies. They have a healthier selection of wraps than you're average quick service restaurant and, of course, lots of yummy smoothies to choose from. I've tried several and have never been disappointed. Peaches n' silk is my personal favorite. I also enjoy their chocolate/coffee smoothies every once in a while. If you'd like to make it an even better option for yourself, opt for Splenda instead of sugar. I always do this, as the amount of sugar they add can be a bit much. 

They do have a few tables in the front so dining in is an option. It's a small area but they keep it very clean. It's very convenient if you're grabbing a quick bite while running errands. 

As the temperature remains over 100 degrees here in Vegas, I plan on cooling off here on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"I really like the food and smoothies here but damn can they hire a couple more people to run the store?? They have one girl running everything it's absolutely ridiculous. I really feel bad for her. This isn't the only tropical smoothie like this either. They really need to fix this. 4.5 stars for the smoothies -5 for the poor management and understaffing."}
{"text":"Came here around 950pm on a Sunday night. We were the only ones in drive thru. I would've chose to go inside but dt is only available. So we ordered a king Caesar wrap, a chicken baja flatbread, a beach bum smoothie and a half turkey sandwich. So first of all, it took 5 minutes for us to order. The person greeted right away, but I have no idea what the hell he was saying. He spoke so fast and then I tried to order, but he didn't respond. So a minute or two pass by & I keep saying \"Hello?\" Then he finally takes our order for the flatbread and wrap and then stops responding.... We keep saying \"hello\" again and then another minute later he finally responds again. And he responds confused saying \"ooookay...\" Like, why was he so confused? 

So, we pull up to the window and he goes, \"So what was your order?\"
I repeat everything again.
\"So did you still want the wrap and flatbread or just the smoothie?\"
Yes we want all the food we ordered.
\"Oh okay shoot hold on let me fix that\"

Like, when did I ever cancel the flatbread and wrap? Lol. Then I ask for the smoothie to be charged on one credit card, and the other 2 items on the other card. He closes the window, then runs everything on one card for some reason. Opens the window again, stares at the cards like it's something foreign then says, \"sorry hold on you want what?\" I tell him again, then he closes the window and calls someone else over to help him redo the transaction. 
I also hand him my friends lvac card for a discount, and he was very confused. He stares at that stupidly too. I respond, it's for the gym discount? Then he closed the window and doesn't ask about it again.
*Everything so far took 10 minutes already.*
10 minutes later, we finally get our food. I had to ask for the stamp card back. He forgot he even had it I guess. 

We get home and look at our receipt and he didn't even give us the discount. My flatbread was okay, kind of dry and barely had any sauce in it. The smoothie was good and the sandwich, but my friends Caesar wrap was very sloppy and had old lettuce in it! I can't believe how horrible of a visit we had. That Miroslav guy was so rude!"}
{"text":"Not sure why such a low rating and what people are looking for in a smoothie shop.. my order was made fast and the girls at the counter were nice and helpful.. smoothies were good too!"}
{"text":"Hope your not in a rush when you get here. The slowest place ever. I waited over 20 minutes for a sandwich and a smoothie. It wasn't even the lunch time rush. They only had 2 people working!! My smoothie was nothing but ice and the food I got was wrong!! Never again! The only reason I gave 2 starts was because the cashier was nice and the bathroom was clean."}
{"text":"Love this location specifically! I've had bad experiences at other Tropical Smoothies but this one keeps me coming back. The location on Cheyenne is extremely slow & I had a hair in my wrap once. This location is fast, efficient & had very friendly workers. Other locations I've been to also seem to have very watered down smoothies but the smoothies at this location are always full of flavor. Go during their 4p-7p period & smoothies are buy 2 get 1 free!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot for smoothies! They have a huge variety of smoothies and food options as well! 

I have yet to order food however it seems tasty! The smoothies are made just right and quick. 

Customer service is ok it depends on who's working, but most of them are friendly. The menu is a little overwhelming for me at least. Sometimes I can stand there for a little over 5 minutes trying to figure out what I'm in the mood for that day. 

Pricing is reasonable Definitely way cheaper that Jamba Juice for sure. 

The only downside of this place is the location, the shopping center it's located in is pretty much busy from lunch till dinner"}
{"text":"Jesus Christ it's a smoothie, not a damn pizza. Shit took forever to get my ONE smoothie."}
{"text":"My 10 year old son insisted that I go on Yelp and give Tropical Smoothie 5 stars! I guess he was very impressed with his strawberry banana smoothie. I personally really like the avocadolada and the thai chicken wrap. This is a great place to go and feel like you ate healthy!"}
{"text":"4pm. Possible shift change? Staff running around crazy arguing over who has to do different cleaning tasks and whether they are being paid or not? Rather loudly! Just unprofessional. The place looked a mess. Disgusting! Not sure who owners or manages (or lack there of!) this location? But appears to have really gone downhill in the last couple of months! 

Super disappointing as I loved this location and went several times a week. 

Clean it up y'all! I'll be driving to further locations from now on. 

Happy to stop by in in a couple months and revise my review if it gets better...."}
{"text":"Terrible!  I walked in at 7pm to music blasting and stood at the counter for five minutes before yelling hello! Still no one came.  As I was walking out the door then someone came around.  Someone needs to teach these people how to be professional.  This is the worst tropical smoothie store I have ever been in! 

This review is on service (or lack of), as I did not get a smoothie."}
{"text":"Maria customer service skills are horrible. I ordered a jetty punch and asked her to add lite peanut butter and to code it as lite peanut butter simple because it's $.75 over the normal $.99 addition in cost. I know this because the girls at the other location on east Camelback made me aware of the cost difference which I thought was great! This is my first time to this location and I asked Maria if she could code it the same way and she simply replied she couldn't. I asked why and she explain because she was told by her manager not to. I understand that it's not her fault but her tone and demeanor was just rude. Needless to say I will not come back to this location I appreciate the other location that takes care of me as a customer in regards to treating me as if they want me as a customer and providing me with good prices and quality smoothies."}
{"text":"If you're a a fitness person who likes to watch your calories and macros, then I suggest you watch how they make your drink. I asked for Splenda and the young lady almost put turbinado sugar (high calories), I also asked for very lite peanut butter and she almost put the whole entire ice cream scoop full of peanut butter in my smoothie. They will definitely over serve you on the portions which is cool for some but not for others who are watching their calorie and macro intake."}
{"text":"Trerapha did great for having no help at all. Working the drive threw and the inside line. I'm sure he would appreciate some help though..."}
{"text":"Everytime I come to this place I get terrible customer service. For the last 3 times I have come they tell me they don't have the vegan chicken strips. It's not that they don't any but they have to unfreeze it, and they are too lazy to do it. I give up on this place."}
{"text":"I thought that this place would be a great especially since it is an easy walk from my house. However, they are under a new regional manager and it reflects that their efforts to keep customers was not a priority. I had boughten a Highland Hawk Boaster card only because it had a coupon the card for Tropical Smoothie cafe. I loved their peanut paradise. I had already used the card three times within the week at that location actually even earlier in the day, but when I went in later that night I was told they would no longer be excepting the cards because of their new management. I cannot think of a worse way to try to keep customers then to not uphold a deal that was already in place. Not only was my deal not upheld, but when asked about it was given the third degree by their employees and they talked poorly about an employee who had honored my deal earlier that day laughing and stating that she was not their best employee.  I guess I will be sticking to Jamba even if I have to drive a bit farther."}
{"text":"50% off for ACTIVE DUTY service women and men. That's incredible support for the troops. Get the peach silk smoothie. It's amazing. Don't get the mango one."}
{"text":"Please wash your hands after ringing someone up Brittany. Oh, and for a smoothie company that is located on the good side of town, please make sure your location is clean and well stocked."}
{"text":"Horrible service!..Always!..
What a shame..I hope it changes I live around the corner and I am always disappointed. You can tell their employees could care less about their customers."}
{"text":"What a relief to find something somewhat healthy in this food court.  With a name like Tropical Smoothie i was expecting to find a slew of smoothies on the menu, and nothing else, similar to Jamba.  This place, however, had sandwiches and wraps.

I had a wrap and a smoothie.  Both the wrap and the smoothie were good but not memorable.  The smoothie was really cold and I remember getting a headache after my first few sips, but it went away fast and I learned how to drink it comfortably.

Considering that the restaurants aren't very good at this resort, and that typical fast food is plain bad for you, I would highly recommend this place if you were stranded at Red Rock."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I've been to this location where my smoothie was not made correctly. Both of the smoothies I ordered today contain banana, yet, I don't taste banana in either of them. I tried calling the store three times and no one answered. I guess a word of advice, taste your smoothie before leaving the place. Normally, when the ladies make my drinks they're correct. And I've been to this location numerous times. Just a little disappointed today!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed - quality control and training needed.  Extremely inconsistent.  Beware accuracy of app."}
{"text":"Came here because smoothies sounded like a good idea on a 112 degree day.  Customer service was horrible.  No acknowledgment.  No greeting.  No smile.  Nothing.  For some reason I tipped a few dollars and she didn't even say thank you which really irks me.

When the order was done I said thank you and again...no acknowledgement.

Gave it 2 stars because the smoothies were good.  But this location could care less about customer service as I can see through experience and with the other reviews."}
{"text":"I've only been to a Tropical Smoothie Cafe one other time before here in Vegas. I tend to want to go to Jamba Juice as I really like their smoothies here, but since the closest Jamba Juice was closed due to electricity being out, I decided to come here and give it a try. 

This location is very small and only has 4 or 5 tables. The registers where you order is all the way to the back of the place, which seemed weird. Anyways, I decided to get the smoothie called Sunshine which is made of mango, banana, oranges, pineapple and orange juice. This one is under the Classic smoothies. Not really a problem if you are really hungry, but they only have one size a 24 oz size. I was able to drink it all in one sitting, but the babe only could drink half of hers. 

The guy that took our order wasn't at all friendly. He didn't smile or anything. Just took our order and then made it. Our drinks did come out quickly and tasted good. 

Pros:
Large size and more then expected for the price.
Order came out quickly

Cons:
Place was tiny.
Trash was overflowing.
Ordered my babe her drink from the Classic menu, but was still charged for a specialty drink.
Staff not very friendly."}
{"text":"The place is super slow for lunch but the smoothies are so good it's worth the wait. The blueberry almond smoothie is my favorite. The food options are mostly microwave heat ups, but the tacos are pretty good."}
{"text":"Typical smoothie shop. I came here at the last second before they closed to get a smoothie for my sick girlfriend. They didn't give me any grief, I apologized and ordered one smoothie, they made it quickly and I was on my way.

Usually I go to different locations and get a sandwich or wrap and a smoothie and it's always good. Consistent quality and fair customer service.

Definitely over-priced for what it is, but they're all the same price."}
{"text":"Great healthy smoothies! I've only tried the carrot and spinach blends but they were both yummy. Very accommodating staff. They were running a happy hour morning special and that's a good opportunity to try new smoothies (I don't know if it's still going on or not now). I haven't tried the food yet but I bet it's just as yummy."}
{"text":"Long wait, incorrect food prepared, not enough people working here. After all the negative reviews it seems the owners don't really care to fix these repeatedly mentioned issues."}
{"text":"Smoothie-wise, they have a pretty good selection and tasty ones. Definitely won't be getting the greed tea infused smoothie again; it had a citrus sour taste to it and not entirely sure what they used to \"infuse the green tea,\" but it tasted like a sickeningly sweet syrup that was almost unbearable to drink.

As for service, I've been here a couple times all at various times of the day, and the employees seem to take their time making the smoothies. I came in the morning through the drive thru one-two times, and although there was no cars in the parking lot or in the drive thru, it took them a good 10 minutes to make my one smoothie. 

Today, I came around lunch time and while I understand that's a busy time, it took them about 20 minutes to make the 2 smoothies I ordered through the drive thru. There was a car in front of me and since it was taking a while, I thought they may have ordered food only to see the employee pass one smoothie to the car. Again, I can understand waiting during the busy lunch hours, but there's a point where it gets pretty ridiculous. When I pulled up to the window, it took about 5 minutes before someone came to acknowledge me only to have gotten my order wrong and ended up waiting another 10 minutes for them to make the smoothies. I expected more and any other businesses would have had the smoothies ready by the time I pulled up considering it had been 10-15 minutes from the moment I had ordered and gotten to the window. As I was leaving, I did notice there was only 5 cars in the parking lot and I'm sure 1-2 were their employees'. If I hadn't been in a hurry, I would have definitely parked and gone in to speak with a manager. 

Honestly, the employees are blending drinks and making the occasional food, it shouldn't take 10 minutes to blend one drink with 2-3 employees working. 

Side note: they do have happy hour from 5-7pm where it's buy 2 smoothies and get 1 free"}
{"text":"This place is 24/7 so that's pretty convenient. But I think in this last year their smoothies have not been up to par and it's just this location. Sometimes I'll get a smoothie that has too many ice chunks in it or it's totally bland. The prices have also increased it's now almost $7 for a smoothie, I don't mind paying that price if they could just be consistently good. It's definitely hit or miss at this location."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here. It was so hot outside the day I went I wouldn't leave my dog in the car and the staff were very nice about being me my drinks outside. So cool. I love this smoothie place. Maybe not as healthy as a true juice place, but way better than other food choices"}
{"text":"My favorite smoothie shop in town. Great smoothies and good food as well.

I recommend the Peanut Butter flatbread with bananas and honey. Buffalo wrap has a good kick. 

Not cheap, but good and healthy. Nothing better gefore a hockey game."}
{"text":"Worst service ever stood in the lobby for 13 minutes while the workers looked at me behind there window no other customers in the place. I continued to wait only to get no service ended up walking out. They should just close the location if they only serve 2 customers a day"}
{"text":"Very bad service! Went in earlier today and they forgot to make my smoothie. People that ordered after me got there's first. I waited around 20 minutes and had to ask 3 times about it before I got it. Very lazy staff. And my smoothie was horrible it had no flavor my friend got the detox smoothie and hers was disgusting to. Don't waste your time or money coming to this place."}
{"text":"We only went to this location two times.

The first time was an online order.  When we went there they could not find it. We have them the confirmation code and showed them through the app that we had already paid.  It took us 20 min to resolve situation.



The second time we went was during the day around 12. Only one person was working and she was making an order for someone else. After waiting 5 min with no acknowledgment of any kind I walked out."}
{"text":"They have some great smoothies here. It can be a little inconsistent but service is prompt.  I don't eat here because I'm usually disappointed in the food but that doesn't take away from what they do well."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Was about 4-5 people in line and they made us wait about 15 minutes to just take out order. I should not have to wait 30 minutes to get a drink. & if you are going to make people wait so long , the least you can do is apologize. Customers come first. I'd rather wait for me drink sitting at a table then have to stand in line. Annoyed. At least the smoothies are good..."}
{"text":"Meh.  This place was just average for me.  It's about what you'd expect going into a Jamba clone.  Service level was friendly. The smoothie didn't have me doing cartwheels, but it did did hit the spot to curb those semi hunger pangs that hit between lunch and dinner.  Definitely sit outside (unless it's Winter or Summer).  Although much healthier than the Pizza Hut a couple doors down, I did have a weird craving for Pepperoni and Jalapenos after leaving here.  =P"}
{"text":"Tropical smoothie is great....if you are the only person in the store. What they consider a \"huge rush\" is 5 groups ordering apparently because there were a few people waiting and I joined the existing line while the employees looked up at us in daze like they suddenly forgot how to say \"we will be right with you\".  

Presumably the manager finally emerged from the kitchen and seemed annoyed we were interrupting her. She was short and hardly even looked up while I ordered. I was frustrated at this point but even an inkling of good customer service would have saved me at this point. Instead I got basically \"what do you want\" and a card swipe. Nothing about how I just stood in line for 20 minuets while they played the quiet game. 

Seems to be a lack of management in general. These kids won't greet people and have any pride in there ability to serve customers if the manager doesn't even care. So does the owner even care? If this was my place of business I'd be livid with the horrible customer interactions and complete lack efficiency. When I worked food service you had to bust your ass during a rush. These guys clearly don't know what that looks like and don't have an example to learn from. 

I love it here and come here all the time. GET. IT. TOGETHER!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and poor management, I ordered 4 smoothies and 3 sandwiches. The smoothies were brought out within five minutes and the girl says the food will be coming out shortly,  I wait patiently another 10-15 minutes and then then talk to somebody in the back about what is going on. The girl has no clue about my food order and says apparently it disappeared from their screen. She offers says she will have it made and I demand my money back for everything , wasted all my time there for nothing. I will never return to this place again, piss poor service !"}
{"text":"The Avocalada ( i think that what its called) is sooooo bomb!!!! I added energizer and fat burner with it and I was able to kill Camel back mountain in an hour and 48 minutes. It was my first time and i would like to think the drink helped out a ton. Will definitely go back with my family."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for a smoothie, this is the best smoothie place I have ever been. They have a huge variety including low fat at low carb smoothies.

I normally get a cranberry smoothie anywhere I go and end up getting heartburn. I get the cranberry crush smoothie at TSC and its very mild. I absolutely love it.

I have never actually been into the cafe before, so I cannot comment on the service or decor. I always send my assistant :)

The only reason I am giving this a 4 is because the food they serve is pretty average. Also, if you order fruit for a side, you literally get a piece of fruit. I ordered a veggie wrap one day and ended up with a whole orange, unpeeled, as my side. Kind of weird."}
{"text":"Ordered a totally turkey wrap through uber eats delivery. The wrap was so soggy and just fell apart.
I had to take all the lettuce and tomato off which basically left me with turkey and Swiss on a soggy tortilla wrap. Also, they didn't give me a straw for my smoothie. The detox green smoothie was good as usual.  Won't order food from them again."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. The service is so incredibly slow you would think they are hand picking the fruit. Everytime we come to this location it takes so long that I actually started timing them. Their response when asked why it takes so long \"We only have two people here\" but their lobby is empty and there was one car before us in the drive thru. I can't wrap my head around why it takes two people twenty minutes or longer to make 2-3 smoothies. If was a fluke occurrence I wouldn't be so upset, but this has happened three times to us. We live near this location but I'll drive out of my way to another location with these turtle stepping times. Every other location besides this one goes much faster."}
{"text":"ACAI BERRY BOOST SMOOTHIE WITH NO SUGAR~!!!

..the best smoothie ever! haha I love this location because it's right by the 215, has a drive-thru, is open 24 hours & they have a buy 2 get 1 free smoothie special from 5-7 daily! The workers are nice and the food and drinks are good~ Sometimes the drive-thru line takes forever but if the line looks like it's too long I just go inside! It sucks that they got rid of my favorite wrap, Popeye's Favorite ;[[[ but that's corporate's fault!!!  

HOT TIP: don't forget to ask for a loyalty punch card and sign up for their free Club Tropical program that frequently sends out special discounts!"}
{"text":"Came here at 10:30 with my man for some breakfast/lunch.. It was freezing inside the store.. 
I really wanted to try their Island Green smoothie made with spinach and kale.. But they didn't have the ingredients to make it.. Why advertise something with big posters when you aren't ready to make it? Settled for my usual Sunrise Sunset and a Buffalo Chicken wrap.. I wanted a banana as my side but they were out of bananas..... WTF. So then I decided on baked chips which they were also out of. 

This whole time there was only 1 girl working. C'mon Tropical Smoothie how are you going to have 1 person working the cash register, making smoothies and making wraps!!!!???! So kudos to her because there were like 4 other people besides us. 

Understaffed & Out of Everything...!!! You're better off going to the 24 hour/ + drive-thru one on Flamingo/215!

Hot Tip: If you're watching what you eat get your smoothie made with Splenda or no sugar~!!!"}
{"text":"My every Friday morning joint.  The smoothies are great and the breakfast sandwiches are amazing.  Even at 3am the employees are great..."}
{"text":"Very slow on food. Smoothies took 20min and food 45min. Ridiculous for a fast order place. Hire more employees"}
{"text":"It is so good! The totally green superfood smoothie is my favorite. I am never going back to Jamba Juice for a smoothie."}
{"text":"I was super hungry and saw that the line was short at the Tropical Smoothie Cafe so I decided to go and get a salad from them. I waited over 10 minutes like an idiot at the front while the guy kept telling to wait a second meanwhile he was getting all the food ready. He put out a total of three orders then went to the back after having me wait forever. I'm soooo annoyed so I decided to go to the Popeyes next door as soon as I go to the Popeyes someone else goes to the Tropical Smoothie and the same gentlemen with the neck tattoo that had me waiting forever  immediately greets this customer and takes his order. Maybe it's because I look young or maybe it's because of my ethnicity but this is ridiculous! I wish a manager or supervisor was on duty so I could bring this up to their attention. If this is the type of customer services you're promoting I doubt you'll have a successful business in the future."}
{"text":"Worst visit to any fast casual restaurant!!! This location is supposed to be 24/7 and the door was locked. I took pictures outside to show how the store was presented. It was around 12:55 am I visited. Then 5 minutes later one tiny little girl came out WORKING BY HERSELF PAST MIDNIGHT. How dare the manager not put their employees safety first.  When she came out and unlocked the door she looked weak and claimed to be sick holding her stomach so I didn't order anyway because who wants a smoothie made by a contagious person."}
{"text":"If you want a decent smoothie, this place is pretty good and they have other items on the menu to eat.

1.  Service - not shabby. I believe that the cashiers would do awesome to offer suggestions like extra shot of protein, and etc to help people understand the nuances of menu, since many things are vague.

2.  Noise - When you have blenders going at full speed, it is very hard to hear the counter person.

3.  Smoothies - very nice tasting.

4.  Service again...- Wouldn't it be awesome if they could mark the smoothies when  you order multiple ones?  I am not an expert at what is what. I mean, it is easy to tell the difference between coke and 7-up, but the smoothies are not so easy to differentiate.

5.  Overall - check it out, very nice."}
{"text":"I've been eating tropical smoothie for years. I used to eat it everYday sometimes TWICE A DAY but seems to me as all these new ones have been opening up there food has been INCONSISTENT. 

Idon't care if the service is bad as long as my food is EDIBLE and taste the way it should. I was happy when this one open on this side of town because the food was good but now they are falling off they need to teach they're employees to cook it right and good all the time.
This place food is inconsistent and a waste of money and time. 

I called about an order of mine that i wasn't happy about. (this is the second time in a row) But it was the team leader that made my thai tacos  and it was the worst thai taco I've ever had. If your team leaders aren't making them right  WTH !! She did say i can come back and get a refund. 

HIRE NEW WORKERS AND TEACH THEM TO MAKE CONSISTENT GREAT FOOD THAT WE'RE USED TOO, IF IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD TO EAT THEN THROW IT OUT ! DONT GIVE IT TO CUSTOMERS.  

P.S. I have never wrote about a bad experience, but i just hate wasting money on food with inconsistency. 

please fix this problem and micro manage these people."}
{"text":"If there was NO STARS, this place would get it. This place is SO SLOW. Been sitting here in the drive thru for 10 min, waiting to give our order. Mind you.... there is no one ahead of us. If there wasn't someone behind us, we would 've reversed. Finally gave our order and approached the window... there was no line, bo one sitting inside. RIDICULOUS!!! How does this place stay open? Time to locate another tropical smoothie."}
{"text":"We came in here hoping to have some fresh food... we order for 2 kids and two adults. Service was slow with nobody to in here. 
Three out of 4 meals were not what was ordered. No real special requests, side of lettuce and the beyond meat substitute on one wrap, the 3rd was supposed to be a pizza quesadilla, but no. She didn't realize she had started to eat the meat that wasn't supposed to be there until after the fact. 
They were nice and fixed the issues. Our sides of fruit cups look really old and kind of gross. I had the Hawaiian BBQ Chicken flat bread. They didn't have coleslaw, ok. Maybe that would of made it taste fresh. After everything was fixed the food was just ok, definitely didn't have a freshness to it. The smoothies were good. The atmosphere isnt great until you're into loud music with the F word every other sentence."}
{"text":"I have no idea what all these bad reviews are for ! 

Came her at 5:39pm ordered 4 smoothies and got them all within 5 minutes and the cashier was very friendly and smiling !! 


Love this tropical smoothie !! Our smoothies were made to perfection and very tasty !"}
{"text":"Always a great on the go stay healthy option! I have never had a bad smoothie here.  I  think I have probably tried them all at this point.  My favorite is the new green smoothies, but all have been amazing! 

They are all over the Vegas valley so no one has an excuse to not eat healthy on the go! 

Grab a punch card and sign up for their text alerts.  These are the only text alerts I get, but they do BOGO all the time!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing and I enjoy every smoothie I get despite never being able to remember which ones I've tried lol. I noticed a few people after me have issues with their orders and the cashier was a little off and I've myself had issues at this location. If you can put up with the wait and possible service blips, the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Only 2 stars for the food and smoothies being as expected. As far as customer service, this is probably the absolute worst business to go to. They will let a line form out of the building before they bother greeting you. I don't understand how you can have three people and be so busy you can't even bother saying hi welcome we'll be right with you. Once they finally do make it over to you don't expect an apology for the wait. Expect \"what can I get you.\" Shame. For the prices raising I assumed so would customer service."}
{"text":"Came here twice and NO one is ever up front. First time, I waited a good 10 minutes before someone to appear. And when he came out he was talking to someone who was dressed like a manager and continue to ignore me until they finished their conversation. But I was hungry so I sucked it up. Came a second time because its on my way home and I was again, hungry. Again NO one was up front. Called out loudly twice and no one came. So I just went next door to the gumbo place."}
{"text":"The smoothies are great.  The service is abysmal.   I pulled up at the drive thru 25 before I had to work.  (I work across the parking lot).  There was no one in front of me.  I was asked to wait to give my order.  Almost 10 minutes.  I ordered paid and had to wait another 15 minutes.  Needless to say for 1 smoothie and I was late for work!!! BTW there wasn't anyone in the cafe either.   The worst service ever.  And they were rude on top of it all.   I thought it might have been a bad day.  A few days later I tried it again.  The same thing happened.  McDonalds is cheaper faster and MUCH better service.  There are plenty of people looking for work.  Hire people who give a damn about customer service.  If you dont, you won't be around."}
{"text":"Good sandwiches and smoothies however beware of the wait.  The workers are very friendly always a warm welcome.  The one thing about there sandwiches is that it can get salty because they use a lot of sauce, but just ask for the sauce on the side and problem solved! They have a lot of great deals with sandwiches and free smoothies"}
{"text":"This is a go to place of mine. I order on the app and its ready with in 10 minutes for pick up. PLUS the app offers a $5 reward for every $55 spent. The people working here are patient and kind. It can be busy sometimes but ordering through the app makes that irrelevant. I LOVE the Health Nut smoothie and their food is pretty good too. I get the chipotle flat bread. I have found what I like, and get the same thing every time, and it is always super good."}
{"text":"Came in on my break, was impressed by the large venue. Two people ahead of me and we all got taken care of relatively quickly.  Smoothie representative was polite and speedy, didn't take excessively long to receive my smoothie \"island green\" especially knowing how long it can take at other tropical smoothies. Order came out right and tasted good. Looks to be getting better!"}
{"text":"This has become a new fav for me. Since moving to the area, I have purchased 10 smoothies in the past couple of months. I have seen a few of the same faces but not regularly. My point in saying this is, just recently did I notice there was a rewards program that none of the employees cared to express. Also 7/10 times the smoothies were great but I've noticed some of the employees who don't seem to want to be there at the moment do not properly make the smoothies the same making it grainy or watery. That is an issue because when a customer is use to a certain quality of a product that is what makes them return, if each time I come in I have to be concern with who is making the smoothie (which includes the same ingredients regardless) I will not return."}
{"text":"This is a brand new location for this healthy fast-casual smoothie chain. I've never eaten at one before this, and I wasn't even aware they had food aside from just smoothies... but oh man, they do, and it is good. 

I had a Chipotle Chicken Flatread thing which was kind of like a soft taco eating experience, but it was on a soft fluffy pita type of bread. The chicken was super tender and flavorful - perfectly cooked and beautifully seasoned. Most places overcook chicken which makes it tough and chewy, but the chicken here is juicy morsels of deliciousness. My sandwich also had bacon and cheese and veggies inside - all of it tasted just as fresh and delicious.

The prices here are unbelievably low for the quality you get as well. My sandwich was only like 4 bucks, and it was better than similar meals I've had at twice the price. It's so much healthier eating here than at a fast food place, but the price point seems to be in the same league. I know there was bacon and cheese in what I ate, but I still feel like I did my body a favor eating here instead of somewhere like Sonic or Subway or BK etc... It's strange because the prices here suggest those as their competition, but the quality of the food and fast-casual setup suggests more upscale. 

I suggest you eat here before they come to their senses and raise the prices appropriately. This is a family owned franchise... really nice folks. If you twisted my arm to come up with a gripe, I would say that the noise from them whipping up smoothies can get kinda loud if you're dining it, but this is the same issue at all smoothie places. Who cares. This place is great, and I'm going to put it on my list of places to hit up. Looks like there are less than a dozen locations in the Valley with more on the way."}
{"text":"We come here every once in awhile for the smoothies, which are typically quite excellent. However, today we tried the \"limited time only\" Luau Sliders, and we wish we hadn't. 

We got the Caribbean Jerk Chicken and two Sweet Sriracha Chickens. They were obviously microwaved, as they came out a good four minutes before our smoothies were even finished, and no other orders were being made. They were 90% bun, with what looked like old, frozen white chicken. You know, the kind you had in your elementary school cafeteria. It's not like we were expecting a gourmet slider by any means, but they were certainly disappointing. 

Were it not for the typically great smoothies we get here, I would have left one star. That being said, even the Blueberry Bliss I got today was subpar, tasting almost entirely like a banana. I get banana is one of the ingredients, but the namesake should at least be the overarching flavor."}
{"text":"Very quick in and out in less than 5 mins!! I like!! My smoothie taste awesome. Employees were all smiling"}
{"text":"I've never felt so disappointed in a tropical smoothie before! I was craving them so my husband and I came for lunch, but had we known better we would have spent our time at a sit down restaurant instead! We spent a good 10 or so minutes in line, then got our food almost 30 minutes later. Our smoothies taste watered down. Thankfully the food was good, but that's it. One girl had to keep asking for help from the only other associate in the store just to ring up food. We watched 4 people stand in line for so long that they left before ordering. They need to staff better at lunch time when one is in training! I even time stamped a photo of my receipt time to show how long we waited for our food. People stood in line while being told they'll be right with them as the line grew longer and orders were not being taken. If you go here, make sure you have at least 30 mins to an hour to spend!Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"Slowest drive thru experience EVER. This is our third attempt here. And each time the wait has gotten LONGER- how is this even possible?! From now on, I'll drive out of my way for a better experience. BTW- I'm still waiting for my order... 15 mins and STILL counting!"}
{"text":"Smoothie and food tasted ok but it's a good thing I had a lot of time because this place is slow as molasses!! They seriously need more people working and staff that know exactly what goes into each drink. Unfortunately I won't being returning"}
{"text":"If I could do 0 stars, I would. Worst place ever. They take so freaking long. It's not rocket science to make a smoothie. One car at the window & they warned me it'd be 15 minutes. This isn't gourmet food. Shouldn't be that long! Didn't even order anything, just got stuck in between cars. Fire your staff and get a whole new one. It's that simple."}
{"text":"Not going to give it 1 star simply because this is not because of the food...simply put, the service here has gone down hill. Each time my wife has come here, once or twice a week, they have split a large for our three YOUNG children. No way that any of them could finish their own (even a kids size). I thought it especially accommodating at first that they would split a large for us so that my kids could enjoy one without having to waste. Today when I went in, the worker looked at me as if I was crazy when I asked her to split one for me. When I explained that they did this for my wife all the time, she was quick to deliver a rude reproach...\"we never do that!\" What a coincidence, \"we will never come back here.\" Job well done fellas!"}
{"text":"This place sucks! I go all the time and it has horrible kids working here. The service sucks. All they do is stay on their phones. This one kid was on his cell phone while taking my order. I walked in and they was all on their phones and they said oh I didn't hear you come in. I don't get no greeting from no one. I get no thank you."}
{"text":"Extremely irritated. Going through the drive thru to order an açaí berry boost smoothie and a peanut butter banana sandwich. I WAITED FOR THIRTY MINUTES AFTER PAYING TO RECEIVE THE ITEMS. Wtf. No one was in front of me. No one inside. And I see the workers and who I assume to be a manager because she was in a different shirt color sitting there chatting and playing on their phones. I am not happy."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this franchise lately. Not only are the stores looking emptier by the day, they went from values and coupons to not even honoring the rewards cards any more. Even airlines give you a nice grace period to collect rewards, but apparently Tropical Smoothie gave customers 1 month to come in and redeem their awards. Needless to say, I didn't know the program had ended and when I joyful entered the store thinking I would get the free smoothie I supposedly earned, I was denied. It seems like the place is becoming less and less customer friendly each time I visit it, not to mention all the employees and managers are kids and there is never anyone with management experience in the stores at any given time.

Customer service is very important to me so I will most likely stop going to this company."}
{"text":"Just left this location. Waited for 5 minutes at the drive through menu then tried to see if they're open by asking loudly at the speaker but no answer. Pulled right up to the window and looked in to see a lady talking and laughing with someone behind the counter a a kid sitting drinking a smoothie. Who takes off their headset to talk to other customers. At least I didn't have to wait 20 minutes for them to make one drink."}
{"text":"Went here and grabbed a few smoothies Due to my friends request. Took only 5-6 min to get our smoothies and no one was in line. We left and my smoothie was like an Icee it was so Icy I couldn't even drink it and it was like they shorted me on the flavors or something. Ended up throwing away my $7 smoothie! If I would of had time I would of went back and ordered another one. On a side note my friends was perfect! That's why I have 3/5 stars! Hers was smooth and creamy and had tons of flavor! I just was disappointed $7 loss !"}
{"text":"What do I crave on hot days?! A smoothie, of course! 

When I entered, the guy working the front did not even acknowledge my existence and was too busy talking on the phone. After waiting for about five minutes, he finally got off. He did not apologize for the wait at all while taking my order. He did not greet me or say anything or prompt me to even take my order. He kind of just stared at me... Awkward.

I waited approximately 25 minutes for two smoothies. There were three people working on smoothies, alone. Food was coming out quicker... I watched two customers who ordered behind me (one with a smaller order and one with a larger order) get their drinks like five minutes before me. NOT COOL. Also, I'm pretty sure I saw one of the workers grab something small (nuts?) with his bare hands to put into someone's smoothie. Gross. Please use tongs or a scoop... 

We'll... What can I say, overall? I love their smoothies, but their service is definitely hit or miss. Today has been the worst service I have ever received from this establishment. There has been times where I've been in and out within five minutes with amazing customer service. I guess it depends on who's working and if it's a lucky day. I'm going to try to avoid going here, but the location is really convenient."}
{"text":"I love the drinks I visit frequently. Food is OK.  Service is usually good but this morning was bad.  I walked in to order 4 smoothies and the 2 girls in back gossiping came up took my order and then passed it off to the girl already making smoothies to go back to gossiping."}
{"text":"Drive thru is 24 hours except late nights they're under staff which is really annoying because every time I come here around 11pm or later it always takes about 15-30 minutes to get my order. This has happened 3 times already, to the point where I just put my car on park and the car behind me would turn off their engine. Not sure why they only have 1 girl working at night, there's something wrong with that. Other than that my smoothie was great, just not happy with how slow the service is at night!"}
{"text":"This location is ok, I had a few friends that use to work here so I would always come often but since they left I feel like the service is slow & when I was in recently the guy that was working there who I believe is the owner was arguing and yelling back n forth with a customer who has been waiting for his food for almost 30 minutes & the owner would yell at him how he has to wait. I think that's rude and not a good look for him and his business.

Other than that, the smoothies are great!"}
{"text":"Came here after a work out to get a smoothie and as I was drinking it I noticed something crunchy. I was just thinking that it was pieces of vegetables that didn't get blended well but when I looked at it I found out it was pieces of paper - looks like part of a receipt or something with a skew on it. I don't understand how paper got anywhere near my smoothie."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible customer service!!! I call 11 times for a pick up order and when she finally answers she's rude like I'm the one inconveniencing her!! Then I ask about one the smoothies and she has her attitude saying she's new and needs me to say the name! I don't know it that's why I'm asking!!! THEN I'm fed up and I ask for her managers number or a customer service number and she says you will have to call back another time because I don't have the number. Then I ask for her name which she said it was NICOLE SCATZ then hung up on me! Outraged!"}
{"text":"Please pay attention when they make ur smoothies. they add hand sink tap water to the smoothies. When I ask why used in tap water. Their response were \"it's just water~\" 

At least use filter water..."}
{"text":"Love the chicken caesar salad but one to many times has my order been wrong. Staff sucks... So many teen employees in the back but customer service is lacking big time!"}
{"text":"I had an incredibly horrible customer service experience here. Let me start by saying that I am typically a very understanding and patient person because I have worked fast food as a teenager and know how cruel people can be. 

I've been to the Craig road location a few times and had ok service... this day I went with my boyfriend who had never been to tropical smoothie cafe. We pulled into the drive through and was greeted by a male on the speaker. I asked him kindly for just a second because my boyfriend didn't know what he wanted. About a whole ten seconds later I told him I was ready. I ordered my first drink and before I could order the second one he told me to pull up to the window. I told him I wasn't done ordering and he immediately fired back and said \"well do you realize I'm the only one working in here because someone called out and it's filled with people in here??\" I was shocked! No, I don't realize that. Because I'm in the DRIVE THRU and I don't have X-ray vision dude. All I could respond with was, \"....um, okay?\" And then ordered my second drink. When we got to the window he was once again rude but gave us our smoothies in a somewhat timely manner. I couldn't believe his unprofessionalism and attitude to someone who literally did nothing to him. Reading the reviews, I'm obviously not the only one who has bad experiences here. Not surprised lol"}
{"text":"Although my office is across the street and I've been there for years, this is the first time I visited.

The decor inside is precious, reminded me of my honeymoon in Kauai with bamboo strips everywhere. Lots of bright,happy colors.

I shared a Hawaiian Breeze w Splenda with the wife and our 7 yr old had Jetty Junior. We loved the drink - only 174 calories and very tasty."}
{"text":"I ordered the peach smoothie (forgot the name) that was recommended to me, it was extremely bland. For lunch we had the turkey bacon sandwich and buffalo chicken wrap. Nothing special about either. Don't think I saw a single piece of bacon in the sandwich and the wrap was almost soggy from sauce. The flavor was not very great either. Overpriced and long wait for being the only one in the drive-thru, probably won't come back."}
{"text":"I get it, I will forever wait in the drive thru for a smoothie. And I will! BECAUSE I love Bahamas mamas so much! But even being the only car, you are guaranteed to wait awhile. And then you will receive a slight cold greeting, but at least the smoothie is good."}
{"text":"So incredibly boring and overpriced (for what you get). Typical smoothie place, nothing special here. However, the real reason behind this low rating is the owner and other staff members in general....they do not appear to value customers or treat customers in a way that would help to foster good long term relationships. Don't waste your time on this place...go to a restaurant where they value your patronage and care whether or not you ever come back."}
{"text":"I am pretty sure there is crack in the Smoothies, because since I had the first one I find myself fantasizing about it all times, day and night.
 The Peanut Paradise....I would sell my Mother, and possibly two of the dogs for.  It must have almost 500 calories, so it IS my breakfast, but when it's that good, really, who cares?
 There are several Roberto's near by. I have NEVER driven PAST a Robertos for ANYTHING in my life, yet I find myself sneaking past, looking sadly at the pictures of Rolled Tacos, as I make my way BACK for possibly the second Peanut Paradise of the day.
 The staff are ok, no sense of humor, and a little slow sometimes. The Smoothies are NOT alwas the same consistency, sometimes almost too runny, sometimes so thinck I look like I am trying to suck a rat up the straw. A really tasty freaking rat that smells like Peanut Paradise.
 If you go during the off times the place is empty. During rush hour it is SLAMMED but still pretty quick.
 My daughter said the Bacon Ranch Chicken Sandwich was the best thing she had ever had in her mouth. @__@ Blocking THAT thought, she has had several Smoothies and liked them all.
 They even have an almost dessertish selection with coffee and carameley flavors, and you can get any of the them with Splenda, and add things like Energy, and Weight Management. Thank God, or I'd weigh an extrea 45 Lbs by now.
 I would be ok with that, find me a Chubby Chaser who liked Peanut Butter Breath.
 But since I get the Weight Management.....heh.
 If you decide to go, let me know, I'll meet you there. Even \"Death by stranger met on Internet\" wouldn't stop me from going.
 Hells no."}
{"text":"I love the smoothies, I order with Splenda for the GF, and just NO sweetener for myself. They are just as good,
 The Chicken Pesto Flatbread is delish, most of the food is. The salads are a good  gluten Free option.
 Casual, quick, usually not too busy. Great for lunch or a late breakfast. They have  several breakfast options.
 I add Flax or Oatmeal to make it a meal, with no food. Now I want a smoothie. Peanut Paradise. MMmmmmmmmm........"}
{"text":"I've done a review of this place 3 times and they never show up.. But I want it to stick around because the food is amazing the smoothies are great and the prices are better. My entire work has sort of flooded this place with business lately and I can't tell enough people how awesome it is. Keep your eyes peeled it's sort of tiny tucked between two other stores."}
{"text":"Teddy was absolutely amazing!! We had a very complicated order and she was so nice about it!"}
{"text":"I love Tropical Smoothie when I'm cutting calories. My favorite smoothie is a Blimey Limey with Splenda and no pineapple. It's great that they offer the option of Splenda. They have proteins you can add in for extra as well. If your looking for a more indulgent smoothie they have that too! My husband's favorites are the Peanut Butter Cup and the Acai Berry Blast. 

Tropical Smoothie also offers food. I have never tried it cause it is a bit pricey with the almost $6 smoothie. But it does look good and they have meatless \"meat\" options too! 

This location is always clean and the staff is friendly. Make sure you ask for a punch card so you can get a free smoothie when you buy 10! 

If your looking for a refreshing drink or just looking to replace a meal with a smoothie Tropical Smoothie is a yummy place to check out!"}
{"text":"Smoothies are good and the wraps are good as well. The workers just take an extremely long time to make the drinks and food. I've called in my order many times and it is never ready when I arrive. I've also gone in with no one else in line and my drink took 20 mins to get made. I had to ask them and they told me they thought I had left. The smoothies are good but hopefully they can get a little faster."}
{"text":"Horrible service since the change of management. People that work here especially the person they call \"manager\" with ugly make up and earring in the middle of her nose is useless and idiots! Took forever for their services. Also, whoever the owner need to man up and take care of their customers! They can't use my rewards because they said it is not working, advertising coupons that they said it is not working and can't even honor anything since part of them messed up. NEVER AGAIN with this place! If you want to save time don't ever come here! It will take 30-45 minutes for your smoothie or food."}
{"text":"I got a giftcard to this smoothie shop and it's right my house. I got a classic strawberry and pineapple smoothie and a blueberry muffin. Both are really good. The shop is clean. The service is friendly. Good start to my day."}
{"text":"I love Tropical Smoothie. My favorite place to go and grab smoothies. I love going in during happy hour: 5-7 Buy 2 get 1 smoothie free. It's a great deal and I always surprise friends with their drinks and they love Trop as well. Great friendly staff!!! :)"}
{"text":"Smoothies always come out great. However it takes WAY too long. This is the slowest tropical smoothie. Employees keep a very straight face. Almost making you feel uncomfortable coming here I've been to this location a few times because it is convenient but it would probably take me the same amount of time to drive down the street to the further location."}
{"text":"Beautiful location and the staff is so nice and personable. Which is not always the case at a fast food place. I have been several times now and every time has been great!"}
{"text":"The site and signs say 24 hours I've come here multiple times for the drive through around 1 am and it is never open. I don't know if that is false information or maybe the grave employees just hide & hope for you to reverse? I used to come here all the time after my late shifts but it's been going downhill for months now. The drive through menu signs are torn up so make sure you know what you're getting in advance. Takes forever to make your food. I'm surprised this place is still open. They should just close down or hire new staff all together."}
{"text":"The horrible service continues!! to make this long story short, I have been ordering online for a few months. Almost every time I have ordered, the order is either not ready, I am not greeted (I waited 10 minutes for a hello at the front counter at 6am) and one time the store wasn't even open. On Oct. 5th, the store was not open. I didn't get to have breakfast that morning because of this store. To make it worse, it's been 5 days and they still have not even given my money back. DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION!!!!"}
{"text":"I usually enjoy tropical smoothies. However I went to this location to pick up lunch for my wife and I. I was the only customer after a half hour I asked what the problem was, the employee stated it was his 2nd day and he was by himself. He was able to make 1 of the sandwiches that I payed for. He was unable to refund the other one. I left and gave the sandwich to my wife who said that it was inedible."}
{"text":"Horrible! Came to this location a few days ago and ordered the Caesar Salad. I went through the drive-thru. What I saw in that bowl when I got home was disgusting. Mind you I live in the housing divisions adjacent to this location, not a far drive at all. Anyways the bottom of the salad bowl was filled with water, I can understand a little water but this was just gross. The lettuce was limp and soggy and the about half of it was browning. I went back and he agreed that it was gross and offered to make another one which he did. It was a bit better \"looking\" but it did not taste like fresh lettuce at all. I'll avoid this location in the future."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome. The first time I had the food it someone brought me take out while I was in the hospital. I thought it was awesome. Being skeptical that I would think anything great while in the hospital I stopped in for lunch. The food was just as good. 

Both times I had the spicy tai chicken wrap. It rules. It could be a little spicier but I think that of everything I have ever eaten. The chicken has a good flavor, and wonton noodles add a nice crunch to it. 

Only three stars for the ordering system. I won't complain that the food takes a minute. Hey its fresh, I am willing to wait. Ordering was a little confusing during a crowded lunch, but maybe I am being a bit nit-picky."}
{"text":"Stop in this morning to get smoothies and the gentleman working was sweeping the floors. No hi, hello,I'll be right with you, nothing. So few minutes later we asked him is there someone that can help us he said I'm almost done. Took our order and went about making our smoothies but hands down worst customer service ever!"}
{"text":"Love the peanut paradise smoothie. Hate the customer service. Only 1-2 people working. Much better customer service at the Charleston/Town Center location."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here, but lately it seems like either the employees just hate working there (being that it's 24 hrs now) or they are just inexperienced. It sucks to have to check who is working to determine whether you want to eat there or not. Service is slow and it doesn't seem like new people are trained well. I ordered a flatbread the other day and it was made horribly. All dressing, about 3 pieces of lettuce and chicken. My smoothie was also clumpy. Today I ordered the same thing, and I soon as I get home I discover that my flatbread is a hard as a rock! SO irritating!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. They wanted me to pay for a smoothie that I ordered and I had been waiting for for 15 minutes LMAO okay you can keep your 5 dollars. Every time I've come their food is so gross I just toss it and I give up. I thought 3rd times a charm but I guess not! Do not go to this horrible location"}
{"text":"So I have had a few bad experiences here and finally came to write a review. I ordered a Flatbread and they drenched it with buffalo sauce. Are they serious? Who would eat that?! They need to train their staff on how to make flatbreads! It just looks disgusting. Never going here AGAIN. Additionally, their menu is sold out of a lot of the menu items how can a business be sold out? The franchise owner clearly has no idea how to run their business from operations all the way to staff training."}
{"text":"I've been here several times with lackluster results.  Dirty dining area, poor customer service, slow service, etc..  Today I risked it again and ended up being so pissed I stormed out of there with my wilted, cold wrap in hand.  Never again.  

I approached the counter and order a buffalo chicken wrap and asked what they had to drink aside from smoothies.  I didn't see the fountain drink machine where it used to sit in the lobby and I didn't feel like pounding down a calorie heavy smoothie as a drink along with my meal.   The employee said they had nothing BUT smoothies.  I said \"Not even water?\" and he said \"No, we ran out of water bottles several days ago.\"  (Hold up, you guys ran out of water bottles several days ago and nobody has made any attempt to get any more since then?  In several days?  Even go to a local grocery store and buy a few cases...?)

So I order my wrap, with no drink, and the cashier tells me they'll bring my food out to me.  I say thanks and I tell him that I will be sitting in the outside seating.  (I really had to take a phone call and I didn't want to be rude to the inside dining room patrons by doing it there.)
I sat outside and took my call and it lasted 20 minutes, in that time nobody brought a wrap out to me. 

Finally I came inside and sat and waited another 10 minutes...  Eventually I got up and asked where my food was and the cashier walked into the back and in my line-of-sight asked the cooks where my buffalo chicken wrap was and I saw them point to the top of the kitchen shelf...he reached up and pulled down my wrap and sheepishly brought a cold, soggy wrap to me.  Nobody brought my wrap to me as promised!  Additionally, when they realized that someone hadn't received their food (or more like hadn't been \"brought their wrap\") they didn't even make an effort to keep calling that customer's name *occasionally* to try to locate that customer.  (Hint: Nobody drops $8 on a wrap at lunchtime and then just wanders away.)  No, they just shoved my wrap on a kitchen shelf and forgot about it for 30 minutes.  Grrr...

So at this point I'm late getting back to work, I'm thirsty and I'm furious.  I took my ridiculous cold, soggy wrap and left.  I get halfway to work and I open it at a red light to start eating it in my car and that's when I realized that they took the time to shove 2 different glossy, color printed promotional ads for Tropical Smoothie Café in there, but they didn't give me a single napkin ....incompetent donkeys!"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times for the same exact smoothie (avocolada + soy protein), and each time it's tasted different.  I've had tropical smoothie in AZ +FL and I know what this smoothie should taste like.  What a let down.  Really makes me question the quality of smoothie I  receive from this establishment."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Tropical Smoothie Cafe, and I'm really glad that one of the highest rated ones is super close to where I live! 

TS is a gem. They always have text deals and coupons in your mail floating around, so you really have to be active in getting/finding them if you want to save money on your smoothies! 

They workers were super fast at making our food and smoothies, and all of it was really tasty and I would definitely go back again. The only setback is that they sometimes work so fast that they forgot to make the smoothie I ordered on the receipt and didn't apologize!! But, it took them all of 3 minutes to serve it up, so I guess its okay--just a minor setback :) 

So join the text club and get yo smoothie on!!! It's about to be one hot hot hot summer!"}
{"text":"Definitely the worst Tropical Smoothie I have ever had. The last 2 times I went there was a long wait. Furthermore, my Smoothie wasn't sweet & the last time I ordered the avocolada the drink was bitter watered down. I took it back & they remade it. However the guy said that it was not as sweet due to them not having anymore coconut. But he assured me that his manager was on thier way to get more! He did offer me more sugar as a substitute Smh. I had so much hope for this place since we have no Smoothie places close to Henderson but this place is a pure disgrace & deserves to have the managers or owner replaced due being a terrible franchisee"}
{"text":"Very bad customer service I asked the young lady named Salina Why my smoothie wasn't free since I had 10 stamps she couldn't answer it I asked who would I need to contact she said I don't know! I said is this a chain she didn't know. Very disappointing!!"}
{"text":"While the smoothies are nice, be prepared to stand at the register waiting for someone to actually acknowledge you even though they deadass look you"}
{"text":"I love Tropical Smoothie, but unless they are growing the fruit while you wait there is absolutely no reason why I just sat in the drive-thru for 20 minutes when there was only one person ahead of me."}
{"text":"I wouldn't have known about this place if it wasn't for my boyfriend. I have been passing it for weeks but never noticed lol. 

After they gym my boyfriend said  lets get a smoothie I told him there's no smoothie places over here he said to me , did you yelp it ? So I did ! ;) The number I got was only for delivery service but she gave me the number to the store so I could get the exact location. We had already passed it by kid take as we were driving home. Flipped a U turn and went back. Tucked next to Game stop and Sally's in the target parking lot on Stephanie. 

This store has a more modern look then the other Tropical Smoothie locations I've been to. While the others have a more beachy look , this one does to its just different , more modern and brighter. A lot smaller so im sure it can get packed. 

We had the pineapple delight because they were out of mangoes. My usual order is mango magic because it's my absolute fav. The cashier informed me they were out of mangoes since they place their orders on Wednesdays they sometimes run out of fruit the following Monday or Tuesday. I told them to order more mangoes since it's my favorite fruit. She agreed and said she mention it to her manager.

All in all the store is new and clean and the staff is friendly and fast. Our smoothie came out minutes later. It's was refreshing and yummy and the perfect way to end a great workout. I'm glad they're in the Henderson area. Seconds from galleria close to home and on my way home from the gym. I know I will be a regular here. Now only if we could get a boba place on this side of town ! I would be the happiest girl :)"}
{"text":"Just waited over 20 minutes in drive through. Pretty sure it's a 1 person show there. Sunday September 25 @ 1:20 PM."}
{"text":"Worst tropical smoothie ever.  

Never anyone at counter and 30 minutes just to get a smoothie on multiple occasions.  

Avoid at all costs!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I cannot believe the lack of service at this place. One employee? To handle the afternoon on a Saturday? I will never come back."}
{"text":"I love my peanut butter blast. It's non fat frozen yogurt, peanut butter and banana and whey or soy protein. It's a simple drink and very yummy"}
{"text":"I only go here on occasion but I like the drink I order, the place is always clean, and prices are fine. I have never eaten here before so I can't really comment on that."}
{"text":"My advice to Tropical Smoothie? Stick to what you're good at... convenient Smoothies for the masses.   

Yes,  there are salad, wraps and other casual food fare available at tropical smoothie cafe, but they seemed to be chronically understaffed to provide timely service for anyone one in to eat. Expecially if you are on a time line to eat your food has to do not go during a short lunch hour. 

This particular location has been in Henderson for several years-and the décor is definitely reflective of that little bit thread worn and shabby. The staff look tired and not -so- thrilled to be here,  but I suppose being understaffed  creates grumpy clientele and bad moods for all."}
{"text":"This location is absolutely horrible. 2 people working and it takes over 10 minutes to even get an order in? Especially when the place is empty. I've seen people standing in there waiting for their order to be taken, and new people will walk in and place their order first. Everyone needs a customer service class because they definitely lack it. Aaron is completely unprofessional and makes people feel uncomfortable. It may be a joke to some people but for this location, it makes it undesirable to come back."}
{"text":"Everybody is so slow and unapologetically rude here. I wouldn't mind waiting 10 mins for my drive through food if the customer service was even just decent. They jam their hand in your car for payment, announcing a total without any \"hey how are you?\" Or any sort of courtesy. And good luck getting an order correct. I have had multiple awful experiences here, hoping that at some point they could get it right. So far, super disappointed."}
{"text":"The smoothies are amaaazing but the staff is kinda ugh. I go there a good amount and never have I seen a worker looking friendly. More like wondering why you're in the cafe cause they wanna go home. Makes you wanna get in and out real quick. Other than that, good smoothies, good prices. Happy hour, yes!!"}
{"text":"Like my ex-girlfriend, dirty and slow. When I asked if they forgot about my order I got attitude (just like my ex). I'm the only one here and I it seems like they are going to Jamaica to make my Jamaican jerk wrap. 

Sincerely,

Disappointed"}
{"text":"The service here at this location is horrible. The employees are rude and non accommodating! This is the second time I've come here in the past two weeks and it will for sure be my last! I'm so sick of their attitudes and slow service. It literally disgusts me to give them.my money. The only reason I do is because I have 2 toddlers that love their smoothies! Something really needs to change because this is no way to treat customers! One week an associate says they can split smoothies the next week they cant! Like give me a flipping break and be compassionate to people with kids trying to give their kids good quality drinks. Ugh!"}
{"text":"I bought the reusable cup because I definitely see myself coming here frequently when I'm in a smoothie mood.(50 cents off when you bring it to use.) I've only ordered the tropical green one for myself so far because I love it! The second time I requested no added sugar, still delicious. Last time I went with my boyfriend it was during their happy hour, so we got a third smoothie free! We got the peanut butter, delicious choice for when you're in an indulgent mood and want to treat yourself."}
{"text":"They don't answer their phones. I tried calling between 5p and 6pm at least 20 times, then cAlled between midnight and 1am, because I work overnight and the phone was busy or kept ringing then would go straight to voicemail. Also IT SMELLS FOUL each time I walk in. Like Vomit or old mop water...please please fix this."}
{"text":"This place was a little slow today, I still believe it was a nice staff and respectful, the prices are a little high for me but the smoothies I tried were all delicious. I will go back but not a every week type of place."}
{"text":"It's very upsetting how unfriendly the employees are. And to top it off the restroom smell like an ashtray!!! Totally NOT what I'm used to when it comes to Tropical Smoothies!!!"}
{"text":"This is it people. There comes a time in your life when you are left with no choice but to change your mind. I was not a smoothie person. I thought it wasn't me. And the few that I had were either too sweet or too slushy! Oh, no not the smoothie here. And I could feel how the blueberries were fresh and mixed with as little of the bad stuff we see on the news. It tasted gooood. I mean if there were no copyrights I'd make an add saying it does a body good.

My experience started with visiting a fellow Yelper, Grace S., to meet with her colleague. They both work in the same building as this place. Soom after we realized that the man I went to see, Shane, was a regular here, and lucky me, he was on his smoothie run! Yes I tagged along and that's when it happened.

Shane just ordered 'the usual'. I love blueberries so I went with the Blue Lagoon. THE BEST SMOOTHIE EVER! Ladies and gentlemen, I kid you not. And the staff were friendly, and everything was clean. What more can you ask for? Oh, right, sandwiches! Yes, they sell stuff you can have for brunch or lunch too! One stop solution my friends. Go try a Blue Lagoon ASAP."}
{"text":"Very slow service, I watched the cashier handle money then start making the persons order without washing her hands or putting on gloves  (yuck!) don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"Came in and no one was inside. Stood there for a few minutes till someone came out. I ordered but it seems like my food was rushed. I got home and my wrap came undone."}
{"text":"Service is slow at this location.  I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap without tomatoes  and a Sunrise sunset smoothie. They messed up my order and put tomatoes on it, I could have complained and gotten a new wrap but I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes , so I just picked them off. Smoothie was delicious. This is the only Tropical smoothie in my area, so I'm sure I'll be back whenever the craving hits but I sure do wish they had more than 2 employees working the drive thru AND the inside. This would help them be faster and more efficient."}
{"text":"I've been contemplating writing this review a long time. Oct 17th on Wed night at 10:50pm to be exact. I walked in and met the utmost rudest employee ever. This guy acted like I was ruining his nap. He grabbed my money and threw together my meal so sloppy I was shocked. I even asked if he hated his job and infront of everyone he said yep. This guy needs to be fired big time.  Food sucked but I think it was just because he hated his job and I woke him up. I will just go next door to Roberto's next time"}
{"text":"I can't imagine anyone giving this place less than 5 stars. 

Through Yelp I discovered a TropIcal Smoothie Cafe last month on a business trip to Tampa and had 3 green smoothies within a 24 hr. period. When I got back home to Matthews NC, the first thing I did was search for a TSC near home and was very happy to find this one! I'm a regular now and have enjoyed meeting Kevin the owner and his great team. The smoothies are great & healthy & delish and the food is equally yummy!

Everything is cool at The Trop :)"}
{"text":"I LOVE Tropical Smoothie. I have been going for years, and even worked at one in high school. That said I have never seen worse customer service at a Tropical Smoothie. I have been to this location twice this week. The first time a very nice young lady was helping me when several other people came in and joined the line. I could see another employee and a manager in the back having a conversation and paying no attention to the customers. Today there were two employees, one in the front and one in the back. The woman running the register and blenders seemed extremely disinterested in assisting customers. She put in my order, and I moved to the side. My sandwich came out first, but I did not respond to the name called because it was not my name. The woman gave me a condescending look and said \"That's yours.\" I responded by saying that it was not my name and she replied \"Yea, I typed it in wrong.\" If it had been a typo, I would have understood but she put my name down as Allison which isn't even close. The management at this location needs to step it up, they are not representing the Tropical Smoothie brand well at all."}
{"text":"I like smoothies at 3 in the morning, so I like Tropical Smoothie.  I like the Sunrise, Sunset made with Splenda and whey protein.  Yum."}
{"text":"I'm in love with the mango magic! Friendly staffs! Feeling very refreshing especially on a hot day! I can't wait to come back and try more of other smoothies!"}
{"text":"What a horrible experience! Went to grab a peanut butter cup smoothie after a movie. The smoothie tasted like nothing but chocolate, banana and ice. There was no peanut butter flavor whatsoever! While scooping with a spoon, I discovered a large clump of peanut butter the size of a fist. I brought the smoothie back to the counter and asked them to re-blend it. The girl said that she would remake it for me. She still could not get the peanut butter to blend, then asked for assistance from the other employee, who decided that pouring tap water into my smoothie was a good idea to solve the problem. At that moment, I was done and asked for my money back."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. The owner is even worse. God forbid he actually tell his staff to provide good customer service. This particular location will never see my money again. I'd suggest the TS up on Cheyenne and 215 or the location at Durango and Farm. Much better service and ownership."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst tropical smoothie I have ever went to and they take forever on your food and sound so unprofessional"}
{"text":"Worst Tropical smoothie ever! Workers are extremely rude and would rather chit chat then service customers."}
{"text":"Decided to try tropical smoothie for the first time.
Basic etiquette seems to be nonexistent here. Didn't get greeted at all or acknowledged for that matter. Employees talk way too much about personal likes and dislikes. 
Hey, I'm all about having a fun work environment and talking amongst each other, BUT not to the point you make customers feel like they are a bother being there.
Giving a 2 star because me and my son did like the smoothies and it's pretty cool how it's 24 hours. Maybe the night shift is better? Who knows..."}
{"text":"I love coming to this location and the workers here are very nice and always get my order correct with all the extras I order & make sure you fill out the receipt for next time to get a $1.99 smoothie with purchase of a wrap...it's worth it!!"}
{"text":"I usually always go here for a smoothie and they are pretty much all yummy(the ones I've tried)...today I am trying their Hawaiian BBQ chicken flatbread and ordered a buffalo chicken wrap later for dinner because my work has food but not that great and always expensive too....this place gets a bit busy around lunch so, if you go around noon be prepared to wait a little longer"}
{"text":"So, today my son and I stopped by here again to give it a second chance from my previous rating and it was 100% a better experience.  We both ordered the triple berry oat smoothie and all American wrap, the cheese was melted perfectly and the smoothies were delicious! Also, I'm not sure if new employees are there now but everyone was very friendly and seemed like they were actually glad to be there and to be working  we will definitely be back in the future .                               ***UPDATE***** So, we came in today and service was ok except the girl Samantha was a bit frustrated because the rewards level up box was not working so, I didn't get credit for the $14.03 I spent but, she said she was able to give me a $1 discount...I was trying to use the $5 off I had earned but, this place is a hit or miss and I think from now on we will just go to the Tropical Smoothie on West Charleston...it just can't seem to remain consistent and the wait time is way too long TBH & I stopped back by on the way to work (after dropping my son off at work) because the guy that made my smoothie made it wrong it tasted of nothing but cinnamon & it was awful but Samantha fixed it and I barely made it to work on time"}
{"text":"I love their smoothies but not with their food. A couple of my co-workers ordered their flatbread and wraps and both weren't happy with their order. The one in Power & baseline, both, said had better food. I have yet to order their food since I haven't receive a thumbs up from anyone but will definitely come back for their smoothies."}
{"text":"OK experience overall
But when I walked in there was no one at the register and I had to wait a good 4 minutes till' a very chill dude came and took my order very smoothly.
I got the peaches n silk and I couldn't really taste the peach in the smoothie. 
I will still be returning in the future though since it was just one poor experience."}
{"text":"Good Food. Not so great service. I waited 20 minutes for a smoothie...and no they were not busy.
For some reason the food and smoothies during the day aren't that great, however in the evening, everything is always better.
This place must have a very high employee turn over rate because every time I've visited, the cashier never knows how to run the register."}
{"text":"Came here for their grand opening and got a free smoothie or item of your choice card for being on the first 50 guests here. There is plenty of room for seating and the ordering process is super easy especially if you download the application. Since it is the grand opening there is a lot going on, my strawberry limeade tasted a little different than normal (hence the four star rating) but it wasn't bad and the service was fairly quick. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Went in and noticed that they only got a \"C\" for their health inspection but decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. This place is open 24 hours but they shouldn't be. Went in at 10pm and the service was horrible. Ordered my smoothie, waited 10 minutes, went to check on the progress because the smoothies before me were out really quickly, and I see both of the employees just on their phones. I asked if mine would be out soon and one employee had me tell him what my order was again. After I told him, I waited and then he gave me the wrong smoothie. Which meant that I had to wait even longer for the right one. There's no doubt in my mind that he was stoned. Not worth the time or money spent there. Never going back."}
{"text":"Bad experience. Came here around 11:30 PM got to the menu where you place your orders waited for about three minutes... started saying hello is anyone there?, nobody answered after I'd say five minutes.. so drove to the window honked my horn a few times still nobody to the window. So finally I get out of my car to peep in the drive through glass and saw someone hiding in the back.. So I knocked on the drive through door. Finally the lady came out with the wooooorrrrst attitude ever. I literally had to bite my tongue. She was so rude when taking my order because I requested no bananas. If you don't like your job quit. No one is forcing you to stay there and someone will gladly take your place. She needs a serious talk on CUSTOMER SERVICE cause she has absolutely none."}
{"text":"Pulled up to the drive thru with no greeting, he just asked what I wanted to order. When I pulled up to the window, I waited almost ten minutes. During that time, the workers were using vulgar language and having inappropriate conversations. Then the guy finally came to the window and gave me my total and I give him cash. He puts $3 plus change in the bag of food which is unsanitary. I've had other situations before but after today, I will never go there again. 

What Tropical Smoothie Cafe has to offer is great when it comes down to the menu, but the customer service is horrible. This is a location where management who cares about customer service needs to be there at all times or hire a new crew."}
{"text":"The employees at this location do not care about good customer service. I ordered a Thai chicken bowl to go and when I got to my job to eat before my shift started I realized there was no chicken in the salad. I called the location and they asked if I could come back in and I told them that I could not, because I was at work. The employee told me to just bring in my receipt. I told him that the cashier did not offer my receipt after I paid cash. Then they said I could just bring the food in and took my name and number down. I didn't feel as if he was very concerned that I no longer had a lunch to eat. When I went back in a couple of days later with my salad, the manager had no information regarding my situation. Apparently the person I spoke with on the phone didn't even bother to write it down. I had to re-explain everything to her and then she refused me a refund since I didn't have a receipt. I told her that she should make sure that her employees give out all receipts if that is required for a refund, and that I was never offered one. She finally agreed to give me a refund, but did not give me the full amount. When I pointed this out to her she made a face and dug change out the tip jar to give me the rest. Then I pointed out she did not give me to tax back, and she said she couldn't give tax back. I told her that you can't tax people on items they didn't receive and she dug through the tip jar again all the while making faces and mumbling to herself. I used to go this location a couple of times a week, but after this I will never return."}
{"text":"Terrible! I've been to this location 3 times in the last 3 weeks. EVERY SINGLE time they have messed up my order! Not only can they not follow simple directions, such as \"no banana\", or \"no cheese\" they also don't label the wraps at all. When I order multiple items, and the wraps are not cut in half, how am I supposed to know which wrap is which? The employees need some serious training at this location. Mistakes happen; they don't happen that often though. I would rather drive all the way to the location on flamingo and 215 to make sure I get my order right. Getting home and then having to drive back to correct the mistake is getting old. Plus the employees act like they could care less about their mistake. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Love this location since it's opened. 

I got the cranberry truffle because it's back temporarily and I haven't had it in years! Thank god it's back!

I always get the chicken pesto flatbread with a side of hot sauce because it's absolutely amazing. 

Employees are always nice here and it's open 24/7!"}
{"text":"What a joke.....They sell gift Cards here but then tell you they can't accept gift cards. Drove almost 10 moles since thre arent many of these stores in the valley, just to be told no gift cards are allowed. One of the workers advised that her manager has known about this for some time now and will eventually fix it....was advised I could visit one of their other far away stores and try to use gift cards there.....No hospitality or apologies given for the inconvenience I experienced."}
{"text":"Totally excited about a vegan menu and dairy-free smoothies!! They have such a healthy menu & can substitute anything with soy!! Also has a drive-thru and soy chicken!!"}
{"text":"If your hours are open 24/7 why is the door locked at 930 with a group of guys sitting inside drinking smoothies? This is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Don't know if I should bother writing a review for a drive thru smoothie run, but since Yelp will continue to remind me about my visit here, let's do it!

Drove up, ordered, paid, received smoothies....amazing!

The wait was very short, service through the window was with a smile, and of course, the smoothies are always good here.

Not much more to say!"}
{"text":"I'm only giving three I would have given it a five star if they had made my salad fresh. Salad was good but the lettuce was old like if it had been there for more than a week. It was already yellow brown. That just made my appetite go down. Smoothie was ok still will go for just smoothie but if they can't make a decent simple salad fresh why would I even try the food...."}
{"text":"I love the smoothies here and it's very convenient because I work down the road about 2 minutes away. It's also my go to after leaving the gym to head back to work. So as to why it's only 3 stars, it seems that almost every other time I come here I have to wait in a long line even though I had ordered and paid through the app. They do have an online pick up sign but that doesn't even matter when there is only one person manning the entire operation with many customers yet to order, which seems to be most of the time. Lack of management and/or staff here is the norm. I try to tell them that I am picking up an order but usually get a stare or no response. On my most recent visit I order 15-20 minutes before showing up, walked in to a line at the counter so I waited by the online pickup area, when she finally got to me I was told it is going to be awhile as she was backed up with 10+ orders. She did not seem to hear me when I said it was an online order almost half an hour ago by then, and had given my name to her. I should have left but chose to stay and wait since I already paid for it. So I waited, frustrated of course as I was going to be late for work, two minutes later it seemed it clicked in her head that it was an online order as she brought it over to me, name on it an all already, and told me to have a good day. No \"sorry for the wait/confusion\" as should have been told to everybody there. They seem to forget that there are a lot of people at lunch, and need to have a minimum 3 people there at all times during the lunch rush, maybe be more clear as to where online order people should be in line so they can get in an out fast, as is the purpose of ordering through the app. We will see what happens on today's visit."}
{"text":"All of the tropical smoothie places are the same and they suck. The staff act like they are doing you a favor when waiting on you. Orders come out at a glacial pace. Every store has the look and feel that they are about to go out of business. It's really too bad because it's a great concept."}
{"text":"This may be a knock on all trop smoothie shops. When ordering a smoothie they ask you if you want sugar or an artificial sweetener??? How about providing us with better options like agave syrup , stevia, etc? After all, you guys are all about nutrition. Also, why have a refrigerated case next to your cashier stand when it's only 1/4 full of items. Looks extremely cheesy! Come on mr owner, get with it!!"}
{"text":"Just about saved my life

So I got the norovirus and was having problems keeping anything down.  No jello or bullion or ginger ale would stay inside for more than a few minutes. 

Dehydrated and cramping, my wife bought me a Mango Magic from Tropical Smoothie Cafe with the thought that the cold and natural juices would help.  I nursed on the smoothie for the next five hours.  It stayed down and I started to emerge from the throes of what felt like a certain painful, wasting death.  After losing about eight pounds in two days, I had two Mango Magics a day the next two days as I recovered fluids and electrolytes.

Kidding aside, the smoothies are tasty and don't have the artificial flavoring taste that other places do.  I'm grateful we found them and will stick with them for an occasional meal or snack."}
{"text":"I love that they have a 24 hour drive thru! I'm always always on the go so a drive thru is the key to my heart. Well one of many keys. The smoothies here are always refreshing and most of the time I'm never able to finish them. A nice pick me up in the morning when coffee isn't calling my name or a healthy treat on the way home after a long day. My family has been coming by this location and have usually got me a drink. Last night was my first time there. I got a flatbread and I was so disappointed to find my flatbread burnt. Not only did it look burnt but almost smelled burnt. I was hungry so I just made it work and grabbed my own pita bread and placed the goods in there. Someone's senses were off last night aka the lady who so politely handed it to me. (; 

Glad we have tropical smoothie close by the neighborhood now though! I guess the moral of the story is to always check your food. Lol"}
{"text":"I hate living so close to this place because it's always tempts me so... These smoothies probably aren't healthy but they are delicious nonetheless! You can add protein to any smoothie too which makes me feel a little less guilty about drinking this monstrous smoothie. They only have one size which is probably a large but my sister and I asked that they split my last smoothie and they happily did so. I'm sad their pumpkin pie smoothie is leaving but I'll be back to the tasty beat smoothie! It tastes sort of menthol-y which is weird but i love it. I'd recommend joining the text alerts so you know if it's a buy one get one day or not. And they have happy hour Monday-Friday from 2-5 (may wanna check yourself) buy one get one free! I love it here"}
{"text":"waited 15 mins for a smoothie that taste like ice mixed with nothing. absolutely no flavor and used way too much ice. 6$ is overpriced and the smoothie is awful"}
{"text":"Trash! Made everything horrible. Didn't even cut my wrap in half. I hate going out spending my hard earned money in return for garbage. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"I hate this place. I only have a few options for lunch and this is one. There is NEVER anybody at the front and I have to shout EVERYTIME to get someone to take my order. They never say sorry and the employees look run down. This place has consistently left a negative impression on me and I have been going here for 4 months. This place needs me management bad!! UGH!!"}
{"text":"This Tropical Smoothie location is mainly kitchen. The order/dining/waiting area is pretty small, with 5 tables cramped into it. It's also too noisy to be able to enjoy a meal here. The kitchen noise (are those industrial blenders or what?) drowns out the classic rock thats piped in. The best option is to sit outside at one of the common bistro tables outside this & the other 3 restaurants in the building.

I love Tropical Smoothie. If you make the right choices you can get a very healthy meal or treat here. I know that the pineapple is canned not fresh, and the grape isn't actual fruit, it's juice concentrate. They also put turbinado sugar in most smoothies, but you can always ask them to leave it out. (Splenda is offered as an alternative, but  for me it just doesn't blend well with the fruit flavors.)

They also offer sandwiches, salads, and wraps. This is a much better choice than the pizza place two doors down, for all kinds of reasons."}
{"text":"Really you refused service over an hour before you close?!?  I have heard of closing early but closing over an an hour before you are suppose to. Capriottis has all light on and the line is a mile long. Wonder why.....

Side note, People will think you are closed when your lights are all off!  Screw this place. Horrible horrible horrible!  Never again!"}
{"text":"Where is management!? It was over 100 degrees in here in June. The soda machine has been broken for over a week. And today their toaster was down so they couldn't make food. Seriously? If local management can't fix this, regional management needs to step in. Sorry excuse for a restaurant. On the positive side the employees were nice but I felt sorry for them working in that heat."}
{"text":"Amazing service!! I went with my roommate and was immediately greeted. We got the Kiwi Quencher and the Island Green. Had them within 3 minutes of ordering. Nice atmosphere as well really laid back 5/5"}
{"text":"If you want a light, healthy, and tasty lunch this is the place to go. There are plenty of options for sandwiches, wraps, salads, and smoothies. They have a lot of flavors for their smoothies and they all taste great. I love the coffee flavored ones. If you are too tired and don't want to get out of your car, they have a drive through for you. The service is always nice and the place is even great for a study spot."}
{"text":"I live in the Peccole Ranch area and WAS frequenting this location. However, within the last month or so the service has gone completely downhill. 
  It started with nobody manning the front of the store. So I will walk in and can SEE the employees in the back talking while I wait several minutes just to have someone finally greet me. 
   Last week I was in a hurry on my way to work and ordered a chicken pesto wrap with their substitute chicken to go. When I got to work and bit into my sandwich I realized it was actual chicken and it made me sick. I couldn't return it as I was already at work. 
  I never get as much as a smile from the employees, they're rude and always act as if I'm troubling them with my business. 
  I was ordering there quite often before and using their rewards card. (You get it stamped so many times and they give you a free smoothie). I misplaced one and was told that I could start a new one and if I found the old one I could combine the stamps and still get my smoothie.  Well, I found the old one and took them both in to redeem my smoothie since I had the required number of stamps. The girl behind the counter rolled her eyes and said \"I don't even know if we can take it like this.\" Another girl came over with the same attitude and said \"it's fine.. Just take it\". 
  While I received my free smoothie I also received the worst possible service. 
   I will not be going back there ever again. I'll just take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Location&Parking: This place isn't really hard to find. Located to the right of Albertsons and next to radioshack. And there are always parking spaces available at the front of their cafe.

Price is usually around $4 for a regular smoothie. Not that bad of a price. They also give you a stamp card so when you have 9 the 10th one is on them.

Service: Usually just teenagers working at the shop, but they're all pretty friendly and helpful. I usually have my drink out in 5minutes or so.

Smoothies: I come pretty often, at least once a week. So far my personal favorite is the mocha madnesss. And so far I've had no smoothies that tasted bad, all were pretty much on point.

A major plus is that they're open 24 HOURS!!!!"}
{"text":"If you're trying to find something quick and easy. This is not the place. I waited forever just for two smoothies and two food items. Not only, but 4 out of 5 sandwich choices, they were all out of. It was ridiculous and I wish I would've spent my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I am a regular at a number of Tropical Smoothie locations-- I absolutely LOVE the Thai chicken wrap with Gardein faux meat. One recent evening, I stopped into this T.S. and ordered just that. The boy with the glasses and large gauged ears took my order. His tag was not visible and he did not give me a receipt, though, so I do not know this name. Upon repeating my order back to me, everything was correct. Once the order was complete, as I took my bag, I asked, 'With the Gardein chicken, yes?' To which he said, 'Yes'.

When I got home, I unwrapped my wrap and had a feeling that I should take a look before biting into it. Indeed, my wrap was made with real chicken, NOT Gardein.

I quickly drove back to Tropical Smoothie and confronted this staff member about the error. When I asked, \"Why did you make my wrap with real chicken, even though I emphasized Gardein before preparation AND asked you when you handed me the wrap whether it was Gardein or not?\"

His reply: \"It must have slipped my mind\".

Completely unacceptable and absolutely disgusting. Had I not been familiar with what Gardein looks like, I likely would have eaten an entire wrap with regular chicken. I am too scared to go back to any T.S. now, and hope this employee is reprimanded. Thank you for messing up one of my favorite to-go meals!"}
{"text":"Waited 15 min before order was taken. The employee was nice but she can't do it all!!!
Get her some help.
I went across the street to Jamba Juice. The  service will cost this company."}
{"text":"I LOVE the fact that they will substitute sugar for splenda!  Great prices, friendly and speedy service and delicious Smoothies!"}
{"text":"Beyond constantly fucking your order up, some of these folks have no idea of what is and is not appropriate to do to customers. I handed the girl $10 to pay for the order and she gone place my change on the counter- which is so damn disrespectful. Are my hands too nasty or something??? So I low key went off on her ass and and told her to pick my change up and hand it to me in my damn hand. I didn't place my money on the counter so you will not place my change on the damn counter. So I'm Over it and I bet I won't spend another penny in this establishment ever again."}
{"text":"1 star for their Thai Wrap. I took a bite today and immediately spit it out. I got to-go when I ordered my smoothie and my Thai wrap. It looked good on the menu so I decided to try it. I got that feeling of worse than bad medicine in my mouth and could not swallow. I took my wrap and threw it in the trash.

4 stars for their Tropical Island Green smoothie! It has spinach and kale! Tastes great even without their turbinado sugar!"}
{"text":"I normally like tropical smoothie. Today I placed an order for delivery just because In this 113 degree weather my boyfriend and I didn't really feel like going outside and burning to death. They said it would be approximately 45 minutes, so I waited.  An hour passed and I thought \"maybe their just having a hard time at the gate\". So I called and they had stated that the delay was due to traffic and it would be 15 MORE MINUTES..... Mind you that they are literally not even 2 minutes away. Finally just had my boyfriend drive over there and pick up the orders and have them remade. There was absolutely no traffic. Sorry, but that's unacceptable. 

Once I received my order, my chicken pesto was dry and tasteless. My pomegranate plunge had chunks of ice and didn't doesn't taste as good as it normal does."}
{"text":"I love tropical smoothie && I am here at this location quite often. Two things- I want to say that out of the  6-8 times I go a month they are understaffed a good 5 times. But that's not the reason for this review- I walked in, I am the only customer there, the two girl employees that are there are arguing about tips && how they get shitty tips all the time and how they steal tips from each other. Like how dare someone tip $0.38 it sucks that they tipped her that but I'm trying to order and there they are just talking smack about the tips. The only one doing his job is the guy that's there. He's actually taking me seriously && not interrupting me placing my order. Props to him for doing his job! 

Update: Someone just walked in and ordered and because they're counting their tips it's on the house- i literally just paid $19 plus tip... what in the actual hell. Just venting here. These people are nuts."}
{"text":"Good smoothies, but terrible service. Line is always to the door and only 2 people working at any time. The last time I went, it took them literally 20 minutes to take my order, and my lunch break is only 30 minutes, so of course i was late. The girl kept apologizing but that doesn't make up for slow inadequate employees. 3rd times a charm, I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"They literally take over 15 minutes to make a simple smoothie order. I am always stuck waiting in the drive thru line, bored out of my mind. Several employees are waiting around and they have horrible service."}
{"text":"I've been to this location multiple times since it's just next time my house. Everytime it's a let down. Most of the employees I come across are always on their phones and love to take their sweet time at work. And recently I had to show an employee a promotion they have that's being advertised outside the door cause they didn't know. I've never seen such a unprofessional store. It's surprising that this store has not closed down or changed staff considering the constant negative feed back from everyone. Ive been to other locations and they were nothing but delightful, lucky that this location happens to be the most convenient. 

Take my advice and just head to Waffles Cafe up the street for smoothies and a snack."}
{"text":"I like their smoothies but their wraps and sandwiches are always inconsistent and pretty pathetic. Portion sizes and ingredients change time to time. For the price you pay for the sandwiches and wraps, totally not worth it. I'll just go there for smoothies if I guess..."}
{"text":"Sometimes I need a sugar fix, riding around in the car with my dog, so this is a great place to get my fix- smoothies fix that is?
1. drive thru window,yeah no need to get out of the car
2. super cool and friendly staff
3. open 24 hrs with happy hour special
just make sure to mention, not to make it too sweet,as they get a little crazy with the sugar and/or splenda... and certain time of day the drive thru I must admit ,can be slow, but just turn up the tune, and relax...."}
{"text":"The smoothies are awesome, it's just the price that prevents me from going here as often as I'd like. For $5 a smoothie, I could just buy myself 80 oz of juice."}
{"text":"Dropped into this location for a quick smoothie while waiting for my ride. Upon entry the place looks clean and tidy. I guess that's because they have not many customers due to their service. Upon walking up to the counter I wait 4-5 mins before asking the two ladies in front of me if anyone came to serve them yet. They advise no and that it looks as if there's only one person working. A few moments later a cashier/employee by the name of Roxana walks from the back and takes all 3 of our orders. I make my special request and she tells me a price of $4.99. She doesn't state my price WITH tax so when I get my change, without a receipt I request the receipt I should have received in the first place. 

My drink at minimum isn't too off. She omitted the banana as requested but didn't add the extra sweetener as I requested. Nothing to complain about since looking at my receipt she didn't charge me extra for it anyway. 

So for my 20+ mins in their store I observed the lonely one cashier take drive thru order, one or two counter orders, make drinks, and wash dishes in the back all by herself. She looked tired and wore out. Under paid and over worked. I totally get why she lacked enthusiasm and great customer service."}
{"text":"This location is ok. The staff is friendly. The location could use a regular deep cleaning with attention to detail"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for this place to open for so long! Just a few things, they are brand new. Sign says this is one of the 24 hour locations which is a plus. Drive thru is not open yet, looks like they are waiting for their outside menu board to be complete. Smoothies were great, I had the watermelon mojito and my husband had the muscle blaster. I also had the all American wrap and he had the peanut butter banana crunch flatbread-both delicious. The only critique I had on the food was that the cheese in my wrap wasn't melted but that was a quick fix, just threw it in the microwave when I got home. Cashier was very upbeat and polite. They are just slightly slower but I am sure this will change as they are open longer and I will definitely be a regular here! Also, the decor inside is too cute."}
{"text":"I come here once a week because it's close to my job but everytime I go thru the drive thru it's a 20 minute wait to get my order.  Absolutely ridiculous...hire more employees!"}
{"text":"Nice to have an option for a healthy smooth just remember to ask for No sugar added if you want to keep it healthy otherwise you may as well eat cookies!"}
{"text":"Sept '17 and this place is still left with a single employee on a Sunday. It's not possible for a single person to do this job. You can't work the cash register, make smoothies and also be expected to make food.  We have placed it order over 20 mins ago and the poor girl just can't even get back to the kitchen to make food. Horrible management."}
{"text":"I love tropical smoothie however this specific location has terrible service!  I waited almost 30 min for 1 smoothie. There was 1 employee behind the counter and a manage who was walking around doing counts. Why on earth he wasn't helping the very long line  be served is beyond me... I won't be back"}
{"text":"First I tried going to the Tropical Smoothie Cafe on Fort Apache. Despite it being 10 mins to closing time, they said they were already closed. Okay I could deal with that. So I drove around and found this Tropical Smoothie Cafe that had a 24 hour drive through window.

I wasn't really sure that I wanted a smoothie, and maybe that was my mistake. So I decided to order one of their sandwiches. Big miscalculation. I ordered the Hummus Among Us. It is literally two slices of store bought bread, with store bought hummus, tomatoes, peppers and lettuce stuffed in between. For that amount of effort it shouldn't have taken more than a minute to make the thing, yet it did."}
{"text":"Living in the area less than 1 mile away makes me wonder why this cafe doesnt do better. There are hundreds of homes on the area, but this place is always short staffed. 50% of the time; orders are wrong. Owner should sell to new management."}
{"text":"Came in to grab 2 smoothies and a wrap. An hour later we still do not have the smoothies and 5 other customers who arrived after us received their orders before us. Worst service I have ever experienced."}
{"text":"Ordered two Jamaican jerk meals with smoothies did not get rice in the meal as advertised nor did we get the smoothie with a meal price. Not to mention the employees seemed more interested in conversations with friends visiting rather than making the food properly or even in a timely manner."}
{"text":"We love tropical smoothie cafe but this specific restaurant had terrible service! We waiting in the drive thru for 20 minutes before even ordering and then we were told our food would take another 20 minutes to make!! They were so rude they need better employees!"}
{"text":"Love this place. My favorite smoothie is the Blimey Limey. I am really picky on my smoothies and this one I don't have to substitute ingredients. Only issue I have had is one time I ordered my regular smoothie and when the girl handed it to me, she had another persons in her hand too. Both looked very similar and I'm thinking she handed me the wrong one, because it tasted of bananas which I am allergic too. Took one drink and had my son make sure before I returned it but he could also taste the banana in it. One of their other smoothies the only difference is one has banana and the other lime so it must be what the other person ordered or the person made the wrong smoothie in error. Fortunately I had only taken a small sip of it and they replaced it immediately without problems. No harm fortunately. That's the only issue I have had which they definitely need to be more careful about with more severe allergies. I will definitely be back because they are very fresh, tasty and they are open late which is very convenient."}
{"text":"This smoothie place is pretty good. The location isn't convenient if you're in the north Durango area of Las Vegas. The service is prompt. Price is reasonable for a smoothie. They do offer military discount."}
{"text":"Not only was service slow and unorganized, but the store was filthy.   Three employees made one smoothie at a time.  One refused to run the register.  One refused to make a smoothie.  They were clueless about the menu.  They whispered when talking to me so I could not hear them. I asked to donate $1 to the charity being advertised, but thy could not figure that out either.  When I finally asked her to stop trying to find it (minutes later) she said, \"It's okay. The kids will probably all just die.\" Trash was everywhere, granted it was mainly straw wrappers, but they were all over the counter where drinks were being made.   Love the smoothies, hate the service."}
{"text":"Customer service was poor. And the smoothie I got was so awful I had a horrible taste in my mouth for the longest time."}
{"text":"I got the Acai Berry Smoothie and I really enjoyed it. It was perfect for a hot day before the lake. I also ordered a sandwich that I found delicious. The one thing that I ddi like about this place was that they are now open 24 hours. This makes it easier when you want to eat late but don;t want that greasy fast food. Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"Wish zero stars was an option! The person who was talking about the zombie employee was right! Horrible horrible service. The guy that was there was complete jerk. I didn't even order anything because he was super rude. Just walked away and left. I love tropical smoothie it this location is the worst. If you don't mind the drive I would recommend going to a different location."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill for one when they said my name nobody heard them this guy was basically whispering second of all the chick at the register got our order totally wrong and when i broight it to her attention she didnt seem to care and she also had half of her shoes on while working! (Disgusting) we were there about 30 minutes and saw 2 different customers get upset due to jacked up orders!  Like i stated before this place has gone downhill we wont be returning"}
{"text":"So excited to have one closer to home...AND with a drive through. I sat at the DT menu board for a while, because it had been so long since I'd been to one, but the young man on the other end was very kind and patient. (no one was behind me) We've gone several times since they've opened over here and have not been disappointed. The only \"negative\", which has nothing to do with their product or service, is their menu board inserts look like they got wet, so they're faded and wrinkled, and aren't a good representation of what a great place this is."}
{"text":"15 mins and don't have food yet. Understaffed.    One kid working answering phone, making sandwiches and filling a big take out order. It's almost noon. Ugh!"}
{"text":"First day of opening the lady at the register didn't seem to know what she was doing. I am the only customer in the store right now and there are three people working. Manager is busy in the back, and didn't acknowledge me when he came up the the register to help the cashier. Not a good first time experience, but will keep coming back as it is close to my home, and a good working spot."}
{"text":"I used to come to this location all the time before work, for a smoothie with Whey Protein.

I was cleaning out my wallet today and found a punch card for a free smoothie...I hadn't been to TS in months, because they're kind of expensive, and I don't have that kind of money to spend anymore, so I got excited, thinking I could snag myself a free smoothie.

When I got to the location, the girl behind the counter was kind of short with me, and when I showed her the card, she said \"We don't honor that anymore, we discontinued that in September.\"

Really?
So...ok I get it, you can't make an exception, but...I mean, its not like its an expired coupon, or a competitor's coupon or  reward ticket...this is from YOUR location...and even if you're NOT going to honor your own program (which you should do, by the way) how about telling me with a little less attitude?

So...given the fact that I thought they were a little over priced and snooty anyway, I probably won't come back here.  The girls that USED to work here were personable and nice...certainly doesn't seem that way anymore."}
{"text":"I used to go to this location a lot a couple years ago.  I stopped going, because the workers were REALLY rude...they actually made fun of a selection that I made for my smoothie.  

Yesterday, I was craving a coffee nut smoothie with dark chocolate before disc golf, so I stopped in. 

Much better service.  The guy was great.  Very polite, very quick, and I got a discount because I'm an LVAC member.  (Not all locations offer this)

The  location was clean, and the only reason that there is only 3 stars, is that the tables were kind of in disarray, like they were in the middle of cleaning or rearranging and just stopped.  

I'd go back again."}
{"text":"Had horrible customer service by a girl named Naomi had a nasty attitude ringing me up and then she made my drink and she half assed it , tastes terrible so I had her remake it , still was not good . Maybe she was having a bad day , you still don't treat people like that , management should re think her employment there"}
{"text":"This is my fav lunch spot in town! The combo is perfect for me for lunch.. pick 2.. half salad, half sandwich, and 24 oz smoothie. Every smoothie I've had has been great, in particular the Island one (one with pineapple and peach and banana.. mmm). The sandwiches come toasted and warm. 

Also have to strongly recommend the King Caesar wrap. It is warm and toasted like the sandwiches. This throws my boyfriend off and makes him upset (why is a wrap toasted he asks), but I find it delightful. Just a heads up if you find toasted wraps \"wrong\"."}
{"text":"Clean place , awesome smoothies , fresh taco 
I had one of each chicken,Fish, steak.  Good spice spice . For sure going back. And is open 24 hours ."}
{"text":"What kinda place runs out of sugar and half the ingredients to make then smoothy.  This one is a dump"}
{"text":"I am obsessed with the health nut made with splenda and whey, it is so good. The staff is friendly and this restaurant location is always clean. The only downfall is the side fruit is usually not ripe or the fruit medley just tastes weird."}
{"text":"The smoothies are very tasty. I've had many of the fruity ones. They are freakin huge and it's like a meal. I have never tried their food, and I would never bother to try food at a smoothie place anyways, just doesn't seem like it would be very great. Sign up for emails, for the birthday smoothie reward!"}
{"text":"Great location but parking is terrible during high traffic hrs. The juice I had is island green it was so good I mean it."}
{"text":"Big location and the employees were very friendly.  Not a long wait and the one girl gave me great suggestions.  Loved the salad dressing on the side so I can decide how much I need.  I am going to go again tomorrow morning and see how the drive through is & make sure I don't run late to work.  
Overall I was pleased with the food & the service, those folks that complain that there are only 2 people need to realize it's not fast food, it's good for you food.  Everyone is in such a freaking hurry."}
{"text":"Great place to come to when you need a good kick back time with your friends. Smoothie is tasty, customer service is fantastic and service is really fast. My favorites i get here is the sunrise sunset smoothie and a flat bread baja chicken. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The two guys that work here are awesome! They know what customer service means. Laughing joking parking every visit personable...


The reason this place is getting two stars is the girl CHANDRA HAS A F'n attitude and seems miserable. I asked her for a small request and she looked at me like she didn't speak english. Then I watched a young girl ask if there was a certain ingredient in a smoothie and she had a smart response and rolled her eyes like it was a problem the young girl asked. This girl needs to get fired .. Seriously!"}
{"text":"Always tastes the same,reasonably priced. Service is as good as you can expect from teenagers making min wage. Not sure why these places all have such low ratings"}
{"text":"Worst Tropical Smoothie I have ever visited. I waited in line for 20 minutes without even being acknowledged. Ended walking out without even a peep from the single employee working the entire store by herself..."}
{"text":"Customer service here is the absolute worst! Management seriously needs to get some people with some personality and regard for customers who are patronizing. Smoothies are almost always inconsistent. Let's not even begin to talk about the sandwiches. They have no care in the world how your food comes out. Lettuce is ALWAYS old, bread is always cut wrong and put on the sandwich backwards. I believe if they were to be a customer in their own establishment, they would be just as irritated and upset as patrons. Worst possible location to visit. I'll happily drive 15 minutes pass this location (which is near my home) for better customer service and beverages."}
{"text":"Friendly and great service ! Had the spinach salad and a green smoothie. Very good! Would definitely go back : )"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for a long time, so it bothers me to say that it is going down-hill at a very fast rate. I have ordered food and smoothies here on multiple occasions and I feel like they are prepared without care. Every time I order a smoothie it comes out different or tastes like something is missing. The service is poor, because it looks like their employees have trouble showing up for work. 

Back in October for my birthday I went in there and only one employee was working. Apparently, the other person who was supposed to come in quit, so I didn't get my free birthday smoothie."}
{"text":"Good smoothies... Horrible customer service!! Bunch of kids running this place!!! It's not hard to say hello and thank you it's part of customer service... If you don't like your job... Quit!!! Get a job where you don't deal with people!!!"}
{"text":"Every visit it takes at least 10 minutes per vehicle in the drive-thru. I don't understand why it takes so long for an easy menu, especially when majority of the order are just smoothies."}
{"text":"Just went in to get some lunch. The girl behind the counter was 1)alone 2) very bitchy.   Granted i may be cranky too if i had to work alone during lunch. But maybe with a better attitude I wouldn't have walked out. Train her on customer service"}
{"text":"Clean store,  nice staff, decent location, and good smoothies. Come between 5p any day and get 1 smoothie free when your purchase 2."}
{"text":"This place has the best smoothies & juice options! Also excellent lunch wraps, sandwiches and flatbreads. Great service and an app to earn rewards really pays!
I'd give it 6 stars if possible!"}
{"text":"The manager/owner of this store should be fired. He only has one person here and they play thug music that makes you want to kill the poor girl that is trying to serve you, by the time you get to the front of the 30 minute line. I asked her once when she got a break to pee. She said she waits hours sometimes. Money over people. This manager/owner is awful."}
{"text":"Completely under staffed on a Saturday afternoon... As of now, 1.5 employees here and been here for 15 mins for one smoothie..... It's 12:29pm. I walked in at 12:12. What's the deal!?!"}
{"text":"Had lunch at Tropical Smoothie Cafe. I got the Honey Ham & Swiss Flatbread (plain) and a Hawaiian Breeze smoothie. There were a lot of people in there, but most cleared out shortly after we got our food. The flatbread is simple, yet effective. Warm and soft, with that grilled taste, sweet honey ham, and cheese. It's a good sandwich! The smoothie (pineapple, orange, and non-fat yogurt) was also good, although I think my favorite is still the Jetty Punch (strawberry banana). P.S. Their smoothies are big! When we were leaving I noticed a sign that says they're now open 24 hours. What?? Why?? Who craves smoothies at 2am? I certainly haven't. And they don't even have a drive thru, so what's the point? I just think of it as a lunch place so it confused me a bit. But they do have some quality stuff!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Their smoothies are delicious and I usually come in the morning on the way to work since I work in a business office above the shopping center. I've seen the same woman the multiple times I've come to get a drink and she's really friendly. I'm always able to adjust certain things in my smoothie without it being an issue. I love that their 1 size is big and decently price ($5 average) and especially since they have happy hour going on right now that's half-off during certain hours. The smoothies are have a nice creamy texture and not too sweet. The only thing I didn't like was their salad because the lettuce was a little wilted and the dressing was too thick but the smoothies are the focal point so my review remains at 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Thought I would give tropical smoothie another chance, and this one was just as bad. The woman working the window was extremely rude, and did not have any customer service skills, on top of that we waited about 15 minutes at the window for our food, which is rediculous, tropical smoothie really needs to work on their time management, being that we were the only customers in the drive thru."}
{"text":"So short story I work late so I mostly deal with the grave shift crew. I don't like to complain but I've been going to this location for over a year and they have a new guy on grave. I have been the only one in the drive threw and it takes him forever to even come to the window to tell me how much I owe then disappears again for any given amount of time. I buy food and he never gives me the side that comes with it. I don't usually mind but the it's been three times in a row with the same guy doesn't even ask what I want for my side like the others. He messed up my order food order tonight but didn't find out until I was home. I live so close and go everyday if not every other day and I'm just really disappointed with the service lately."}
{"text":"Slowest service, decent smoothies. Expect to use your whole 30 min lunch waiting for a smoothie. There must be two people working here"}
{"text":"Food is good, smoothies are yummy! Service was as good as it can be with one employee the receipt said her name was Diamonqu she's awesome! Good attitude even in an under staffed busy place. Rating low based on bad management for making her work alone. She's the cashier, cook, smoothie maker and everything else. Kudos to you lady!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab the office lunch, the cashier took the order quickly since I had different payment methods for different orders. Fast easy service and all the drinks were made correctly and my sandwich was delicious"}
{"text":"I hate this location. Idk if they need more staff or what but the service is so damn slow and never an apology. The last few times I've come they either don't have what I want or the quality is subpar. I'm actually sitting in their drive thru right now and I intend to drive off without my food. A man two cars ahead actually just got out of his car to see what's taking so long. I will never return"}
{"text":"This tropical smoothie definitely needs some work. The store is completely deserted, including the employees! I stood at the counter for about 5 minutes before anyone came out from the back. The employee that did take my order definitely did not want to be here. Even though the store is completely empty my smoothie also took a while to finally come out, along with 3 hidden employees I might add. What they are working on besides hiding out in the back is beyond me. 


The smoothie... leaves little to be desired. The smoothie is very watery and doesn't taste fruity at all. Honestly tastes like I'm drinking crushed ice. 

Please take this opportunity to train your employees or the place might stay this empty indefinitely. 

2 stars for having ice cold a/c in this blazing heat."}
{"text":"I come here often before I go to work. Usually I get smoothies and every time I get them they were excellent. I will continue to go here because it close to work."}
{"text":"Okay, I've been to this place many times. I've since taken a sabbatical. Came back and it's not the same. Different staff obviously....and poor service. The place looks run down, dirty. I'm not sure I can trust the food being made right without it being tainted due to mishandling or e expired ingredients. I ordered a Peanut Paradise with Whey and Splenda and this was the first time it came out bland and watered down. No Splenda and peanut butter was faint. Tasted like bland watered down peanut butter with a chalky aftertaste ...a customer who came two customers behind me got his drink faster than mine. I got my wrap first.  With all these cafes getting health code violations, I've decided to drop this all together and either find a cheaper more quality food and service and make my own smoothies at home."}
{"text":"Came in today so freaking disappointed! Dirty tables, teenagers standing around texting and talking to each other. Behind the order taking counter was disgusting! Smoothie juice every where. All over the blenders and counter had spilt water and left open ice bins, water was running for the whole 30mim I was in there! The place was just a mess!! Order taker didn't get my order accurately and it took 30min to get my smoothie.. Pictures attached"}
{"text":"Pure children who are employed here. (Except David; he's great.) I waited 30 minutes in a drive thru for 3 smoothies. Waited 5 minutes before even being acknowledged while ordering, and about 25 minutes to get our smoothies. While paying, the worker left her register open making it so easy for someone to reach inside and steal some money. And she acted like I was bothering her with my business. Never going back again."}
{"text":"Booo. Thumbs down. The smoothies taste great, but the service sucks, every time. Half the time they don't pick up the phone for a call in and the employees said they only ever have one employee working, ALWAYS! How do you run a business like that?! So frustrating,  then the poor employee loses any shot at a tip bc the owner won't staff appropriatey. Sorry guys, but this location blows, too bad it's the closest to my office or they'd NEVER get my business."}
{"text":"So let me first start off by saying... this place has the worst customer service ever!!! So I'd rather give them no stars but not a option.. I waited in the drive thru for 20 mins n they said we will be right with u. N never heard anything again.. I went inside to order n they looked at me and the girl took her head phone out I asked if I could order she said yes n put her head phone back in and never let me order so I left! So whoever the manager is.. needs to get rid of who ever work the day shift and get someone who actually has good customer service skills cus as of now I won't be going back there! And advise everyone else to do the same!"}
{"text":"Ordered from here from Uber Eats while at work, my order was wrong three different ways, my sandwich wasn't edible. I attempted to called this location several time to ask for them to redo my sandwich and no one answered the phone even though they were still open. Left a message without a call back."}
{"text":"Very slow only 2 people working been waiting for over 15 minutes to get our food and still waiting.  There has been 4 people that have left without ordering I am sure because they have been waiting to order for over 15 minutes and the girl behind the counter just keeps saying sorry be right with you. Also she has to ask how to ring up every order so the only other person working has to continue to stop cooking  and go to the register to help. If you are off for the day you will be fine but don't try it over lunch break unless you have at least an hour to kill. Oh and finally got my smoothie and it does not taste like strawberries and bananas only bananas aren't they tropical SMOOTHIE Cafe? All I have to say is oh goodness ."}
{"text":"My husband and I stood at the counter waiting to order for five minutes. There were three female employees in the back who clearly saw us but didn't acknowledge us. They looked at us and turned around and continued doing absolutely nothing. Too bad their service was terrible because I actually like their smoothies."}
{"text":"Was here for the first time the other night and HOLY OMG... The drive thru attendant official lady girl was a sssssmmmmoooookkkkkiiiinnnn hottie, (despite sounding a little slow/handicap when taking our order) the PG rated beverages she made were to die for. We added liquor to them later and honestly I would suggest doing that for those of drinking age. After annihilating the liquid joy we had ourself the sandwich and that was like riding the highway of loooovvvvveee all over again. Despite having gone through a handful of messy divorces I would gladly take one of those money hungry hateful females I used to call wife here just to purchase one of these delights and them smack it out of their hands to show them exactly what they did to my heart.... Everything here is just that good. Keep up the good work guys and gals. Also, I never voted for Obama, I'm Ross Perot all the way. 143 y'all"}
{"text":"This is in a great location by my house. Not to packed and it was easy to find. I can't remember if I've ever tried this particular chain or not but anyways I liked my experience . Staff was very friendly and helpful. Being that I'm on a diet I went with the detox island green smoothie which is 182 calories. It comes with spinach, kale, mango, pineapple, ginger. You have to have an acquired taste to like ginger but after a few sips I got into the flavor. Pretty reasonable priced as well! I guess I came at a good time because parking was a breeze and I got a spot right in the front. The have a variety of options and I'd encourage anyone to try it"}
{"text":"Took my order home only to find a rotten orange included as the side with my wrap order.  Smoothie and wrap were good.  Fruit, I threw away."}
{"text":"This place is a joke... called this store at least 10 times even drove up to it because I was like oh they have to be closed if their not answering, then I drive over and bam they are open and I'm sitting here watching them not answer the phone. Haha this is a joke and I will never ever be back here again!"}
{"text":"If you can get served here, it's usually ok....there's only one poor teenage girl working the counter, making smoothies and food, answering phones and trying to clean. Give me a break. It never takes less than 20 mins to get your order. The employee was even doing interviews the last time we were here. If this is a franchise, shame on the owners for forcing one employee to do everything and dealing with unhappy customers. We walked in and heard \"it's going to be awhile\" yelled from the back. There was at least 5 people in the dining area waiting for their orders. We walked out after 5 mins of not seeing anyone at the counter."}
{"text":"Smoothie quality is better. Had an orange ginger glow which was really flavorful. The flatbread I had also wasn't bad; the chicken pesto. Honestly, their food is a little overpriced for how small it all is. This is still a one star however because I felt SO SORRY for the SINGULAR employee they had working. It was lunchtime, 1230. There's no reason why only one employee is scheduled. I can't even blame her for how messy the lobby was because she didn't have time!"}
{"text":"Great customer service and friendly employees... The detox island green is my favorite smoothie. Lots of add-ins and choices to keep things interesting and healthy!"}
{"text":"Go to another location. Don't eat here!

Literally the worst tropical smoothie location in Arizona. The cashiers must be from the Hills Have Eyes casting or they just are stoned beyond belief. They mumble and avoid eye contact every time I order.

I thought it was just the cashiers that were bad, but the management might be even worse. Aside from awkward jokes and taking 18 minutes to bring out my ONE sandwich, I now understand why the front line employees are like sacks of potatoes - they are trained by these God-awful managers.

My smoothie tasted like ice with a splash of spinach. I ordered it from other locations and it was fine, but of course, this location messes that up too. I'm sad, since this is the nearest location to my home, but it's worth driving a few miles to get away from this disaster. I really hope they can close down or change management FAST."}
{"text":"We stopped here on our way back to Saint George on Sunday afternoon to grab a couple of smoothies for the road. I was pretty excited because I had heard about the Avocolada smoothie and wanted to try it. The line in the drive through was really long so we went inside and it was just us followed by another customer. We ordered and it took about 20 minutes to get our smoothies, also the lady that ordered after us got her smoothie about 10 minutes before we did. They were pretty busy but it was apparent that they were very understaffed for the day. My smoothie was still pretty but not as good as I anticipated. Next time I'm in Vegas I might get them another shot but it's not on my list of first places to go when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Where is the health department when you need them? Came in for a post workout smoothie, paid, sat down while the smoothie was being made. The brunette hair girl behind the counter with the personality of a door knob had the attitude that she needs a new job. After FIFTEEN MINUTES I walked back up to the counter to ask about my order, I see her WITH HER BARE HANDS taking ingredients out touching EVERYTHING and again using her BARE HANDS. YUCK! I walked out. Never again. They even had a free smoothie flip flop promotion day recently and I skipped it, for my own health. 

Bravo to management hiring people like this! You'll be out of business soon."}
{"text":"I live within walking distance of this location and I will not be bringing my business here anymore.  The employees that are working here, especially the ones at night just dont care and dont even know how to take orders properly.  If you have any deviation from what a smoothie originally comes with, be prepared to be overcharged and then given the excuse, \"Oh sorry, we cant change it\"  Case in point... a week ago I order a Smoothie and a King Caesar Wrap.  The employee who took the order never asked me if I wanted chips or Fruit.  (Which happens all the time at THIS location)  Another employee took my money, which he then told me my total was over $14...it should have been just over $12, and I had to mention to him that I wasnt asked if I wanted fruit or chips.  After telling him I wanted baked lays, he gave me my smoothie and the bag with my wrap in it.  I found out once I got home that he still never gave me my chips!  Or tonight, I ordered a Triple Berry Oat Smoothie, with double whey....  Normally with tax the total would come out to $7.01.  The guy charged me $8.09 and when I explained to him that he had overcharged me, he told me to contact corporate...And this isnt the first time something like this has happened....until this location gets employees that know what they are doing, I wont be spending money here again....

I just also want to note that I never write Yelp reviews or any type of reviews for anything, Good or Bad...but this Tropical Smoothie Cafe has been so bad, especially recently that I feel someone needs to see this..."}
{"text":"Terrible late night service. So I go in a little before midnight I walk in looks like no one is behind the counter or for that matter kitchen. There was a group outside and a group inside sitting at tables. No matter I wait not long a minute or two at max. The employee young guy walked in a behind me after minute. He gets to the register doesn't say hi or anything. I make my normal order. Makes it pretty fast, no thanks or anything. Basically doesn't say a word to me except my total. In fact he seemed mad that I made him come in from outside. Drive away and take a sip of my drink. The most watered down version of a Hawaiian breeze I have ever been served by any tropical smoothie and if I thought the kid gave a damn I would have drove back and asked him to remake it. I chucked it when I got him which was not only wasteful but disappointing."}
{"text":"My wife's Aunt owns a place at Oak Island Beach & I happen to find this Smoothie joint that I got addicted to while there August of 2013. As we were leaving I told my wife that the only thing I was going to miss was my daily Smoothie. 

Well we moved to South Charlotte that same month & 2 months later I stumbled across the Fort Mill location. God shined down on me that day! I now frequent the place. 

I now enjoy the wraps for lunch or breakfast with my Blimey Limey Smoothie. My wife enjoys the Tropical Colada."}
{"text":"This location is open 24hrs which is great because I love Tropical Smoothie. My favorite smoothies include: 
Peanut Paradise - peanut butter, banana, non-fat yogurt, soy/whey protein
Muscle Blaster - strawberries, banana, soy/whey protein
Lean Machine - strawberries, banana, energizer
Paradise Point - strawberries, banana, pineapple
Strawberry Beach - strawberries, non-fat yogurt
Jetty Punch - strawberries, banana

For lower calories, you can ask your smoothie to be made with Splenda. I also tend to get King Caesar Wrap, Thai Chicken Salad and Chicken Pesto Flatbread.  The Salsa Sunrise Wrap (all-day breakfast menu item) is good but high in calories so, watch out! 

What I don't appreciate about this place is that they don't seem to honor whatever specials and discounts that are going on at other TSC locations. I got a text from TSC yesterday saying that all smoothies are $1.99 \"tomorrow\" before 10am. I showed the girl the text message and still charged me full price. Yesterday's tomorrow = today.

They have new items about every quarter. I tried the UnBEETable Berry Smoothie. I'm not a fan of beets but it has a lot of fiber, anti-cancer and heart health benefits. The beet flavor is strong."}
{"text":"Yay for drive-through! No more walking in all sweaty after a workout. It's fast and accurate. Unlike most drive-throughs, they actually get your order right all the time. Tropical Smoothie Cafe is so much better than those fast-food places in terms of quality and service.

I love their food and smoothies. I normally get a chicken pesto flatbread or King Caesar wrap, Paradise Point, Lean Machine or a Peanut Paradise. They use fresh ingredients and real fruit. Yum!"}
{"text":"I've always had great food and great service at this Tropical Smoothie location and I've been coming here for the past 6 years.  I moved to an office in Anthem a few years ago but would still come to the Cheyenne location if I'm in the area but they always remember who I am.  I just grabbed lunch from here a few minutes ago and was talking to Mike, the manager.  I get the same friendly service everytime I come here.

My favorites are: chicken pesto flatbread and king Caesar wrap.  Smoothies: Paradise Point, Pineapple Delight, Strawberry Beach, Jetty Punch, Lean Machine and Peanut Paradise.

It's healthy fast food that tastes awesome!"}
{"text":"I always feel so bad for the employees here. The night shift always gets slammed and they only have one person on. It's selfish of the owner to do that to their employees. Schedule more employees!"}
{"text":"the one star is because I like the taste of the smoothie. The service is BEYOND TERRIBLE! every single time I went here the workers never greeted me or they rolled their eyes. Im sorry I am coming in to spend my money for you to do YOUR JOB! I quit coming to the restaurant after several bad experiences. save your money and go to Jamba juice down the street. 

I filed several complaints with the owner. She gave me a gift certificate and apologized. Just fire the kids who dont want to work!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place, there flat bread and breakfast sandwiches are delicious, and smoothies are simply amazing, but with all good tends to be some bad. Not sure why, but there burritos to me at least don't taste very good at all, but that is more/less preference, however I will say this there regular sandwiches although decent are in my opinion way to expensive for what you get. When you have options such as subway where you can get 2 or more foot long sandwiches after 4 pm for only $5 each. I would easily rate this place a 5 star if not for my taste buds towards there burritos, and in my opinion overly priced 3 out of 5 sandwiches."}
{"text":"These poor girls are getting their butts kicked. It was one of the girls first day and it was an AWFUL lunch rush for them. We waited about 20 minutes for our smoothies and about 30 minutes for her to tell me they were out of the chicken-free strips.... so then my options were limited and I was under pressure because the whole entire line was just staring at me, so I chose a peanut butter & granola flatbread. After she made my flatbread, I reminded her about my friend's Mediterranean bowl, because they clearly forgot it. At this point, we're at 45 minutes! I honestly did feel bad because it was to the point that they were drowning, there was nothing they could do. Everyone was so upset with them. I spent my entire lunch break waiting for my food and I had to scarf it down on my way back to the office. Worst experience!!! I'd rather go to Jamba Juice down the street where I can enjoy my hour lunch, at least it'd only take 15 minutes vs. 45 minutes =/"}
{"text":"I HATE this place!!! I come only because it's close to where I live & the food & smoothies are healthy & tasty, BUT this particular location is SO SLOW!!! I've been to several others & NONE are this BAD!!! I'm talking 20-30 min waits constantly... It gets 2 stars instead of 1 only because they keep the food & smoothies as good quality as other locations..."}
{"text":"Killer healthy wraps, salads, flatbread & sandwiches with a smoothie on the Side to enjoy & make your body happy!"}
{"text":"I've actually been to this location two times already but its BRAND SPANKIN NEW and the location wasn't set on Yelp yet. The first time I went I was surprised at how small it was but it's kinda cozy and tucked away. If you weren't looking for it you would miss it! Its also next to Sally's Beauty....which is even better! My very first night getting a yummy Acai Berry Boost the young male employee was sitting at a table on his break and ran to the door to open it for me. How sweet! After ordering,  he waited for me and opened the door to let me out.  Again. .. Sweet and excellent customer service. Not only that, as I walked to my car,  the employee thought I was coming back in and looked ready to open the door again! Now THATS anticipating guest service! This smoothie place is off to a excellent start!"}
{"text":"Very good smoothie .... however staff is rude no one smiled at me during my interaction with 3 people . I was not greeted and when given my smoothie a young Lady stated my name without making eye contact handed me my smoothie and walked away while I was saying thank you !!! Yikes"}
{"text":"I just ordered a tropical chicken salada sandwich cause is just my fav sandwich in the world , just because is toasted , but helloooo i just got it and is not toasted and then i  remember is just the freaking lazy guy is working this shift who just because dont want to turn on the oven send me this awful sandwich he didn't even cut it in half , so disappointed"}
{"text":"Went to try this place out despite reviews about bad service just because its 1 minute from work.  Showed up at 7:55am, the open sign was turned on but the door was locked and there were no employees in sight. I actually waited in my car a couple minute because I really wanted a smoothie. The hours they have posted say they open at 7am. Just lost a customer... hope the management/owner reads these reviews..."}
{"text":"Food is good but service sucks. When you go through the drive thru it take about 5 minutes of waiting at the intercom before they even take your order and if you go inside and order you get your order taken quicker and even if you are the only person inside it takes forever for them to make your food!"}
{"text":"This is a terrible tropical smoothie location. Even short lines take forever to move and no one ever acknowledges me even though they see me standing and waiting for quite some time. The location is small and smells awful, but I can't put my finger on what it is. I wish I didn't like my triple berry oat and blimey limey smoothies so much."}
{"text":"I'm so bumping this place down a star.  I come here SO often but it's not because they blow me away with their amazing smoothies and incredible service.  It's simply because it's by far the closest smoothie place to my house.  I discovered today, after almost 5 months of coming here, that they have a punch card.  Why did I never know about this?  I'll tell you why... because no one ever offered it to me.  

I heard the employee ask another customer today if they'd like a punchcard.  I'd never been offered one before so after I received my smoothie I requested it.  A little bit of consistency in service goes a long way.  And a smile never hurt anyone either.  

Still, the smoothies are decent and the prices are pretty good for the amount of smoothie you get.  There are definitely tastier smoothies to be had, but until those places move closer to me I guess this is as good as it's going to get."}
{"text":"This location is horrendous. When I came they were out of almost everything I asked for. No flax seed, completely out of bananas, and, get this, no straws! For crying out loud, their main item for sale sort of requires a straw. The poor guy working was embarrassed to break the news to us and said he'd actually been informing his district manager, who was saying for 2 days that she'd bring straws. What kind of a manager allows her restaurant to run out of such an essential item? The bathrooms were out of paper towels and were disgustingly dirty. How doesn't this dump get closed down?"}
{"text":"Updating for the final time, because I'm officially done. I went on 2/29 and waited in line for 10 minutes. The service was flat and unfriendly. Right after the girl FINALLY took my order, she told the customer behind me about the app deal (if you have the Tropical Smoothie app, which I NEVER knew about because there's no signage, and no one EVER mentioned it to me, despite being a VERY frequent customer, then you get a regular smoothie for $2). The customer said she didn't have the app but would download it quickly. The employee told her, no problem, she'd just give her the deal anyway. She took another order after that and didn't mention the app to them either. VERY inconsistent service. 

I only ordered a smoothie that day and the girl who a wrap and a smoothie right behind me got both of her items BEFORE I got mine. How is this appropriate? Why are customers not served in order, especially if they are only ordering a smoothie?!? 

I asked for a manager's number and the employee gave it to me. I left a voicemail and never got a call back. I really wanted to share this experience because the service is very inconsistent and extremely poor. 

They lost a regular customer. I'm probably not the first, and I won't be the last. I'm constantly seeing people give up and walk out when the lines don't move (which is a frequent occurrence at this location)."}
{"text":"Tried this place a 3rd time so much better this time!!! Chia banana peanut butter smoothie is great!!!"}
{"text":"My smoothie was awesome so the only reason for the 3-star rating is 2 things: 

1) for some strange reason they had the right side door locked without a sign saying to use the other door. I counted almost 12 people pull on the locked door and the employees didn't offer any explanation as to why. 

2) The music! Please refrain from playing the \"do-me-baby\" booty shaking, long moaning, sexual type of music."}
{"text":"Love love the Detox Island Green!!!! 
So delicious. I recommend The Avacolado smoothie and Total Green smoothie.  The southwest jalapeño tacos (Artisan) . 
Customer service is awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Poor cashier doing the drive thru and inside alone. While I have my car parked in the drive thru window cus I been here for 15ish minutes and going."}
{"text":"This Tropical Smoothie just truly does not deserve this location. For countless months it has been at the same level of service - an absolute disgrace to healthier alternatives. Sadly this area has nothing better to offer... so needless to say the same few of us still waste our hard earned money to support a franchise that should be ripped right from this owner. 

I challenge this owner to contact me directly so that I may educate them on how to run an establishment. I challenge the corporation to audit and revoke the franchise operator agreement that is established here. 

Email me - I dare you. fitbyjohhny@outlook.com"}
{"text":"I just want to say that Hannah the GM is AWESOME!!! I came in today after having an issue on an earlier visit. She went out of her way to make sure that I was taken care of and my order was corrected. She listened to my concerns and fixed the issue with no questions asked. Kuddos TSC for hiring her! She is wonderful. Thank you Hannah for everything!"}
{"text":"Service was friendly, and the place clean. Prices are bit on the high side. I had a smoothe that was large, and good. I also ordered a wrap with chips that was disappointing. It was the size of, and tasted like a hot pocket. Go for a smoothe, but eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times. The smoothies are at a great price and are so delish! I get the acai berry boost! Pre warning the food is spicy! The environment is awesome! every time I come in there is only 1 or 2 people! Also workers are nice!"}
{"text":"Doesn't Matter how decent the food may be or how tasty the smoothies are..your shitty customer service has completely turned me off from your establishment.."}
{"text":"They messed up our order twice after waiting 25 minutes. I ordered a bowl and it came out as a wrap. They also left off an entire wrap from our order. We also had a watermelon mojito that was extremely watered down and underwhelming. Lastly the staff seemed under trained (didn't know how to put in certain orders and ran out of change twice) and very short with one another."}
{"text":"The service was excellent, but the drinks are not my favorite. I thought that maybe it was just the drinks that I was getting, but after switching it up a few times, I still haven't found a drink that I would order consistently. 

Tropical Smoothie uses sweeteners to accentuate the flavors of their drinks and I am not a fan of that. I got the Get-Up-and-Goji ($5.39). A blend of goji berries, peach, orange, banana, and non-fat yogurt. I got mine with Splenda. I overheard a guest ask for theirs with honey. So there are options. Maybe next time I will ask for none and it will be more suitable for my taste. I just like simple all fruit smoothies. In the end, my stomach was a bit upset and the artificial taste of Splenda overpowered the drink."}
{"text":"Came in on a Sunday with only one employee working. There were about 15 customers in the store and there was a long wait for orders. I'm disappointed that there was only one employee working. Waited 20 minutes for a smoothie."}
{"text":"We were craving a smoothie and pulled up and the place was empty. Good for us right? Wrong! The only person working was in the back and said she would be with us in a minute. While we decided what we wanted, she never came back to the counter to take our order, just took the orders from the drive thru. She could see us as she was standing less than three feet away and ignored us until we left. BTW there were ants on the counter which was another turn off. BAD customer service and dirty."}
{"text":"The most smoothie experience I have is little sample cups I've tried and liked and made many at home. My husband has been on a Tropical Smoothie kick and he got a free smoothie coupon for his birthday, so he decided to share it with me. He got the Health Nut Smoothie, it was really good. And it wasn't heavy like I thought it would be. I would get it again and I'd be willing to try out some others. This location wasn't really busy at around 7 pm on a week night so we were in and out with our smoothie really quick. There is no drive thru at this location."}
{"text":"I ordered the island green smoothie and half a turkey bacon ranch sandwich.

All for $8, such a great deal. 

I wanted something light to eat and this was perfect. The sandwich hit the spot and the smoothie was a winner!"}
{"text":"My go to spot for smoothies and wraps.

My favorite smoothie is the Açaí berry boost superfoods smoothie. I like that it's all one size. I believe it's 24 oz. For only the smoothie itself, cost about $6.50. Compared to other smoothie places that's a good deal for its size. 

I've tried multiple wraps and all of them are really good. They have breakfast wraps and lunch wraps. The peanut butter and banana one is really good. It had crunchy granola it is that makes it delicious. 

The jerk chicken one is another one I normally get. Lots of flavor and keeps you going through out the day. 

Ask if the have any specials or coupons available!"}
{"text":"Peanut Butter Paradise is the bomb, the service really  slow.  I have seen the employees texting on their phones and us the customers have to  waited for them to finish and I mean not just a couple minutes, I mean like ten minutes.....  it's the only one by my home.  

Staff need more training on how to have better work ethics........  Good Luck with that one!"}
{"text":"I love Tropical Smoothie, but this location has weirdest hours! It says 2am & we just went at 940pm & it was closed. A girl was in there counting the drawer & couldn't even let us know they're closed. So annoying & a waste of time! This is the 2nd time this has happened to us. At least put a sign up or something!"}
{"text":"I get better customer service at yard sales than here. Lazy kids are occasionally hired. Save your time and money, buy a magic bullet."}
{"text":"We just left tropical smoothie (around 1:50 3/24/2018- if management wants to look up the camera or the receipt) I had my guy take the first but if my wrap and as he pulled away from the wrap a dark hair was coming out of the wrap and hanging from his mouth. The customer services sucks. The staff seemed more annoyed to be there. They obviously don't care enough to take proper precautions when making food."}
{"text":"Maybe going in is better but the drive thru is awful. Had to repeat my order MULTIPLE times (I was speaking loud and clear) so maybe the system is to fault but even after all was said and done I didn't get the sandwich that I ordered. Maybe I shouldn't expect much from a \"fast food\" place but I have been to the Tropical Smoothie off Cheyenne and 215 and they were top notch."}
{"text":"Usually I love the flatbreads here, but today James V. Served me and gave me a pathetic flatbread with barely anything in it."}
{"text":"We love going to Tropical Smoothie. The only issue at this location is that the drive-through speaker or microphone does not work that well so the person using the system cannot hear the order properly. This store really needs to invest in a better drive-thru speaker system. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I want to start my review with the fact that I have been frequenting this tropical smoothie location for at least 2 years. I always expect a 20-25 minute wait time if there are cars in front of me and about a 10 minute wait time when I am the only car. I have had average customer service, nothing spectacular. They are incredibly inconsistent with their smoothie recipes. I generally get a totally green, but today they were out of cucumber, so I got my second choice, the Blimey Limey. It is strange for a smoothie place to be out of cucumber by 12pm on a hot summer day. However, I had my back up. Sometimes my smoothies are very sweet, as though they put extra turbinado in it. Other times they are very bland. They could use some education on the recipes. Today I ordered a both without chicken or cheese- just lettuce, beans, and rice along with my smoothie. I was the only person in the drive lane. I ordered at 11:59am. They came to the window at 12:10pm. Oh someone came to the window to check the fan in between, not to greet me or take payment. When the associate came to the window to greet me, she did not repeat my order, I asked about my b12 supplement, which they forgot. She proceeded to yell to the other worker to add b12 and re-blend. Now I am paying over $6 for a beverage that you didn't make right the first time, and you aren't going to re-make it? I consider this poor customer service. I received my food and smoothie at 12:19. I was the only car in the drive lane for a total of 20 minutes. My advice to you if you go to this location is: 
1. Expect a long wait time even if you are the only car. 
2. Bring a snack if you are ordering food so you don't get too mad when you get to the window. 
3. Don't expect a great smoothie. Be okay with average or below average taste. 
4. Don't expect excellent customer service."}
{"text":"I waited 30 minutes for one person to take my order. I understand that the person working behind the cash register has no control over that so I was still pleasant. I truly felt for this poor soul that had to cater to some of the most ridiculous requests I've ever heard at a smoothie place. Bravo to the employee who did their job with a smile on despite how swamped he was because he had no help. On top of that, the tropical smoothie was out of chia seeds and the rest of ingredients to make my drink. So I waited and had to get something else because I wasn't walking out of there without a drink. I'm giving them 2 stars simply because of the employee who's working their butt off...otherwise I would've given it 1 star for wasting my time. Oh, and the smoothie was still really good."}
{"text":"30 minutes for a island detox 20 pissed off customers who have also been here waiting for their drinks. Manager says everyone is new can't do anything about it. Should close up and give up"}
{"text":"I have to agree. The customer service  is pretty bad. Actually just one person. She wears black rimmed glasses and is always in a bad mood. The other ones seem to be too pretty happy. I dread when I get the black rimmed girl because she is so rude and curt she puts me in a bad mood. I understand everything is made fresh and it takes time to make. I have no problem with that. The food items are terrible. And don't bother with their app. What a waste."}
{"text":"I called my order in and they hadn't even rung it in to have it started when I got here. The food is good but they need more employees to work here or better structured management. This store just lost my business, I'd rather go where I'm not waiting 25 mins for an order that should have been ready when I got here."}
{"text":"I love this place after a big workout. Service I'd always friendly and quality is excellent. If you're in a hurry this place might not be for you. If they are busy expect a 15 minute wait."}
{"text":"Worst tropical smoothie location I have ever been to. We got two smoothies (beach bum and muscle blaster) and both of them were awful. The muscle blaster had WAY too much protein in it and the beach bum didn't even taste like it had banana in it. This location is more convenient for me, but I would rather drive a little longer and get a smoothie that actually tastes good."}
{"text":"This is the tropical smoothie I go to often it's near my home and yesterday was just not a good visit. But the guy working messed my drink up the first time and I paid for two add in supplements when he remade my drink after the first time I asked him if the supplements were added and he looked at me like he wanted to say no but he said yes. My drink in all was about $9. Which is a lot for a damn smoothie that wasn't made correctly. My first sip of the \"corrected\" drink was the grossest taste. Almost like there was a lubricant substance in my drink. I was the only one in the store why was this visit so bad?"}
{"text":"I wasn't that impressed.  Maybe I'm too much of a California Jamba Juice girl, who knows, but when I got my smoothie I didn't think much of it.  The staff was helpful and the food choices looked great but it wasn't enough to make me want to order anything.  Plus I felt it was overpiced."}
{"text":"The food is great, but the staff seems like they are oppressed.  The owner does not like coupons and corporate offers.  He seems like it is your privilege to be there.  I have spoken with corporate about him and his wife, but they say that there is nothing they can do and that they are a very profitable store.  It is a great location, just wish they had better owners.  I travel the extra 4 miles to go to the one at 215 and Cheyenne."}
{"text":"I usually came here after working out at LVAC or doing Bikram yoga. A fair majority of the time, the service was terrible. I usually went late in the evenings between 8-10 PM. Either they gave me the wrong order, the wrong side, the music was too loud in the kitchen (unprofessional), the wait was RIDICULOUS, or a combination. What made me finally stop coming was when I pulled up in the drive-thru to order, the person told me to \"wait just a sec\"...no kidding, ten minutes later, I backed out & drove to the Tropical Smoothie on Durango & Warm Springs -- where service is a million times better. I had two similar experiences prior to the final straw. What the heck are they doing in there?! Management, I hope you know how terrible your service is, and if you knew better, you'd put an end to it. If I could, I'd give you negative stars."}
{"text":"2 out of the 4 times I have been here they are out of ingredients. I find out after they swipe my card. Don't bother. Place is purely managed."}
{"text":"It's absolutely crazy that this places even has a drive thru. Iv been sitting in the drive thru for over 20 minutes now. To the point where the driver in front of me has gotten out of his car and went inside to ask what the hold up is. There is only 3 cars in front of me, I get it's not fast food, but there is no reason the wait should be this long. This drive thru is always slower than most but 20 minutes for an overpriced smoothie....Not a good experience, I will not return.

P.S. I'm finished with this review... and still not at the window to pay."}
{"text":"Never ordering delivery from this location again - we waited an hour and ten minutes. So we got our two chicken wraps, but not our smoothies. We let the delivery guy know we had two smoothies as well, he said he would go back and get our smoothies. Another 45 minutes goes by, no smoothies. We called the location and they claimed we never ordered smoothies, however we did look at the receipt when signing to receive the food. The receipt included our smoothies and wraps. We were charged for the price of two buffalo chicken wraps and two smoothies, only to not get our smoothies."}
{"text":"Went in for two immune blasts and a kid's chocolate/strawberry.  Used my VIP card and got great smoothies.  My daughter loves them too!  :)"}
{"text":"Alright people, I've been here once and I already love it.  They serve food there too!  I first thought it was JUST smooothies, but oh no my fellow Yelper, they have delicious food in there.  

What!?!?!  What is this madness!?!?!  Serving food at a Smoothie Cafe?  YES.  It is real.  I have had the Turkey Bacon Sandwich and it was bomb.  I actually had ordered a half and half.  Half a sandwich with a smoothie.  It is such a good price!  It wasn't a small smoothie cup either.  It was a regular sized smoothie cup, so I definitely felt that I had received my money's worth.  

The staff in there was very pleasant.  When my friends and I arrived there, we were all greeted with smiles.  There was nice friendly chit chat while waiting for our smoothies and food as well.  I feel that the size is a good size.  I didn't count the tables, but they have a good amount in there, and you can definitely look out the window and people/car watch (it's not creepy!...or is it?).  I seriously feel like I'll be stopping by this place every week for their good food and smoothies."}
{"text":"YES!

24oz smoothies for $4.99 + tax. That's all you need to know. The same size will cost you about $15 in NYC. 

The smoothies are delicious and include ingredients like chia, avocado, roasted banana, and all that other good stuff. You can make your own by altering existing menu items. My crew's current faves are the detox island green and peanut paradise.

Service is great. The cashier was friendly. I ordered a smoothie without the nuts and didn't like it. Only took one sip and asked if I could get another one. They made me a new one right away without any hassle.

One important note: They automatically add Turbinado (sweetener) to all smoothies, unless it states that Splenda is used. This is written in super fine print at the bottom of the menu. I ask for my smoothies without sweetener, it's definitely not needed."}
{"text":"The worst place ever!! I just left from there got home to drink my smoothie and it tasted like crap! I tried calling their phone number multiple times to tell them and no answer at all just rang and rang! I'm very disappointed and would advice you not to come to this place!"}
{"text":"The only thing amazing about this place is the food and smoothies. I've been to the Goodyear location and Goodyear has amazing customer service. This one here on Peoria has horrible customer service. The employees here are so dull and look like they have no happy expressions whatsoever. Clearly they come to collect their check. Most of them belong at a mcdonalds in the back to they don't have to \"deal\" with us. The only reason I come to this location so much is because it's right near home. Never friendly and sometimes disrespectful."}
{"text":"We went there today. We have to for over 15min to get our wrap. Then another 15 Min more to get our drink. I feel so bad for the girl that works there. She was all by herself. Everyone was not happy. They need to have a cashier and a person who will make the food and drink. It was gross. She touch all the money then turn around and makes our food. Please hire another person to help her. One person for the whole place is not is bad. You makes money from the drink already. I'm sure you can hire another person."}
{"text":"This is place is big and nice but no one here. If you buy a $25 gift card you will get a 24 oz smoothies free. But they don't have any gift card available.  Why do you have the sign up if you don't have it available? Take the sign down! By side that customer service was good."}
{"text":"Still wish I could give negative stars. Just came from their drive thru. When I pulled up to the window, the employee only said \"can you hear me\" No greeting. At the window, I asked if they still have the LVAC discount and he literally responded with: \"hell nah.\" This location has the worst customer service  I've ever experienced! Ugh."}
{"text":"Terrible, rude, and SLOW customer service. Cashier was moving at glacial pace which is exactly what someone wants when they need to get to work and are just trying to get something to eat. Not really sure why I stood at the counter ready to order for about 5 minutes while the two employees dicked around in the back, even though they saw me at the counter waiting."}
{"text":"Came in randomly because on the way to Ikea.. the wife woman decided she wanted a damn smoothie. 

The place was clean, and smelled good.

I ordered a chicken pesto flatbread, and a berry smoothie for myself. Then some other smoothies for wife and kiddos. 

The prices here are very reasonable. 

My sandwich came out first.. I kind of expected it to suck.. but whoa! It was really good! Smoothies were out soon after, and they hit the spot as well. 

The service was wonderful too! I left feeling really good in every way."}
{"text":"Didn't even order ... only one person working. He was Sweating and overwhelmed. People were complaining that the smoothies didn't taste good. So, I just left."}
{"text":"I always come here after I work out at the gym.

I usually order the peanut butter cup smoothie and it's delicious! I love love love peanut butter 

It was my first time ordering the buffalo chicken wrap. Which was really good! 

The customer service is wonderful tho, the girls are really sweet. I left my wallet here once and called.. they kept it safe for me! 

This place loses one star because it has a musty humid smell every time I enter the doors. I came here last night and it just seems like they don't really clean this place really well. The floor doesn't seem to be mopped or swept.

Other than that I love it here!"}
{"text":"Only cool guy there ia David. He works the night shift and he is awesome. He busts his ass n does an excellent job! Keep it up man!"}
{"text":"Slow and poorly managed.  Waited 20 minutes for 4 smoothies. The girl taking my order also decided to share with me that the kitchen was a \"complete disaster\" and \"kind of gross\" won't be back."}
{"text":"The customer service was very bad went in today and they made me wait so long at the drive thru and when they finally talked through it there was no apology for the huge wait"}
{"text":"Nice employees here. They are very fast even when they are busy. I've gotten the sunshine smoothie a couple of times and it is SO refreshing and good. Highly recommend grabbing a smoothie on a hot day. :) I haven't tried the food but looks decent, I may try soon. This is way better than smoothie king."}
{"text":"I'm currently waiting for my order and spent my entire 30 minute lunch and then some, just WAITING. A couple came in after us and got their drinks before me. Ive seen about 5 cars leave the drive thru as well. Two guys that were in the store before me are still waiting for their drinks and already finished their sandwhich! Ridiculous, disorganized, and poor customer service. If I didn't have to leave a star to comment, this place would receive a zero from me."}
{"text":"Slowwwww....drive thru is a waste! Best just to go in, at least then they can't ignore you.  We waited about 5 minutes before someone even took our order, then another 10 minutes for our drinks.  And then, please tell me how can you mess up a smoothie?!?! Freakin it's not even blended.  There are ice cubes in my drink and I ordered a mango magic that magically has banana in it.  These employees deserve less than minimum wage...."}
{"text":"The smoothies & food are awesome but its never clean inside. Trashes are over flowing, debris all over floor,  The tables and chairs are covered in crumbs. I saw a roach crawl up the wall about a month ago but i didnt want  to say anything because I really like the staff & I didnt want to embarrass anyone. Anyways, just clean it up and show some love!"}
{"text":"Tropical smoothie is back in North town woo! I never got to experience it before but now that I got a flier in the mail saying they're back open I had to check it out. They have outdoor seating and a drive-thru. They also serve breakfast all day!

They have wraps,sandwiches,flatbreads and of course smoothies! I ordered the baja chicken flat bread and boy was it tasty. It was stuffed with veggies and meat. I also had half my mom's buffalo wrap as for her the spice was a little too much though for me it was nothing(of course I am used to trying spicy food). Also as a side when you make it a meal they offered fresh fruit as a choice and my mom asked what they had. That day was oranges and bananas so my mom went with bananas and the banana was big and she said it was perfectly ripe. 

Now since it is a smoothie place we of course had smoothies to drink with our food. They offer seasonal smoothies but I figured this time I wanted to try their Blue Lagoon(blueberries,strawberries, and banana) and it was sooo good. My mom went with the Jetty Punch (strawberries and banana).

Tip: If you go to their website they usually have promos you can print off and then use!

I give it 4 stars for the good service and their excellent smoothies! Can't wait until it warms up so I can get get my smoothie fix more often."}
{"text":"I've never tried the food, but the smoothies are delicious. Definitely one of my favorite places to stop after the gym. Huge variety of smoothies and other tasty treats. I prefer to go on the evening prior to closing, the staff on that shift are very friendly and outgoing."}
{"text":"This is value you can't get over. 14 of us came through and there was only one lady. She still managed to get all our drinks out pretty fast. Drinks were amazing btw"}
{"text":"Very fresh smoothes there vegetables are very fresh employs are very friendly also they open late I highly recommend."}
{"text":"A large smoothie of your choice and a salad or half a sandwich for $7.49??? Sign me up!!! I took my daughter and her friend earlier and we all loved it. Very clean place and we received our food quickly. We all ordered the smoothie and salad combo. The salads are very good and we enjoyed the chicken on the salads- it wasn't dry or rubbery with an artificial flavor on it. The smoothies are pure whole fruit and greens. No sugar, no junk. The prices are right on and you definitely get a lot for your money. We definitely found a new place and will be coming here from now on!"}
{"text":"There's usually a wait and they're almost always understaffed.. yes. But the food has been consistently good every time I've gone, and staff has always been super friendly and apologetic when they're clearly stressed/busy. The drive thru is always a little slower, in my opinion so if you're in a rush, go inside or call ahead."}
{"text":"I think all Tropical Smoothies are great, but compared to other Tropical Smoothies in town, this branch could do better. I went here about a week ago before an event I had to go to at UNLV. My usual drink at Tropical Smoothie  is a Chocolate Chiller with Strawberries - I was very sad that they took this off the menu a while ago, but older Tropical Smoothie locations that I go to are still able to make that drink. I also noticed that they added a drink called the Beach Bum, which is strawberries, bananas, and chocolate. Very similar. I rolled up to the drive-thru window and the employee told me that they couldn't make the Chocolate Chiller with strawberries and that they only had the Beach Bum that I could order as an alternative. In my head, I was thinking, \"Uhm can't you just take the bananas out then??\" I was in a hurry and just went with it because I don't mind getting something a little different. I just don't know why the employees at this branch couldn't accommodate a simple request and think out of the box. At least they were quick with their service so I'll give them that."}
{"text":"The girls working there made my chocolate chiller smoothie the perfect consistency and they made it quick!  Usually I have to wait long at other tropical smoothies."}
{"text":"I am writing this review as I have been waiting 60min for our groups sandwiches to be made. There is only one employee working and I feel very badly for her, but she has made about 10+ smoothies before starting on our order. She also has not apologized to us for the order taking so long. It's a bummer because I love this place but I will not be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"WORST service Ever... First , I tried calling twi place an order, I thought there were busy that's the reason why they were not answering the phone, I got to the place they only have to customer, placed an order , I have to repeat myself twice all the time , forgot to make my sandwich , I had to wait another 5 minutes for them to make my sandwich.  Cristal is the name of the lady that took my order and forgot what kind of sandwich I ordered.... REALLY ???"}
{"text":"Good Smoothies Here! We have only a handful of TSC locations back home. Went here on Vacation. My #1 Choice for Smoothies is Robeks but not a huge chain like TSC or Jamba. Overall my Green Smoothie was quite tasty. But it took over 25 mins for my daughter to get one for me on a Sunday afternoon after a long travel day. A long line of customers & only 1 employee working to take orders and make smoothies? Too much stress. For one person to do everything. Been there. Done That. Customers get aggravated with that type of service and do not return. It isn't so bad Ina Smoothie Shop. I worked a 6 lane bank drive up alone for far too long. Probably the reasons for my Health Problems Today."}
{"text":"The employees are very friendly and helpful, but the place is FILTHY.  The eating area is full of trash and food on the floor. You can see the kitchen from the front counter and it was pretty scary. I think maybe they are just understaffed...."}
{"text":"This is the second week in a row that I have tried to stop for breakfast and have waited for a good 10 minutes or more in the location has not opened.  I have to be to work and cannot wait any longer for the store to open. Very disappointing and I will not try for a third time."}
{"text":"Tropical Smoothie has some tasty menu items other than smoothies, but today I had a smoothie. The main problem I have with these (very tasty) beverages is that they have added sugar. In fact, if you want to make them less sugary, you can choose a Splenda version. To me, fruit needs no added sugar, so the fact that they add sweeteners makes this a place I rarely visit. I make healthy fruit smoothies at home. 

For an occasional treat on a hot summer day, a Tropical Smoothie can definitely hit the spot. Also, If you like to people (and dog) watch, this is a nice place to do it, as there are a few shops sharing a decent-sized outdoor seating area where families enjoy some time together and people bring their pets to hang out in the shade for a while."}
{"text":"The reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because they are 24hrs and they have a drive-thru which makes it so convenient for someone like me (4 ducklings in tow). Other than that...am I the only retard who has gone through their drive-thru late at night and waited forever and ever and ever? More than once? I guess each time i had hoped it was just a fluke or they were occupied. But it wasnt. Sometimes I think when you go at night when their dining area is closed so drive-thru is the only option, the worker(s) is either asleep or is secretly hoping you'd shift your car in reverse.

While inside it's decor has a nice vibe, very large dining space, enough space to accommodate a mommy's club with all the strollers...the service really lacks. There was only one time we have been in there where the lady seemed nice, and that's probably because she has a child that is the same age as one of mine. But, honestly...after frequenting this place more times I'd like to admit...I don't even think they're thaaaat great. I think the food I've tried were alright as well. And I really don't know if I feel that way because of the service.....I keep returning trying to figure it out that I'm only discovering I'm gettin the same reaction each time for a reason.

I was really excited to have a smoothie joint enroute especially after a trip to the park..but sadly, the service has officially kept me away as is the wait time and the fact that my drinks have come out bland EACH time that it is no longer worthed to."}
{"text":"I just watched an employee peel something that was stuck on the bottom of his shoe off and then continue to make a smoothie. No, he wasn't wearing gloves...not that that would make things any better. How does this place pass health inspections? It's always dirty, smells funny,and takes them 5 minutes to greet you. Not sure why...it can't be because they're busy cleaning or washing their hands. I guess I was just desperate for something cold, never again."}
{"text":"I recently discovered the wonderfulness of the Island Green.  Kale and spinach make me feel like I am having something good for me.  Generally, this is a great location in the morning on the way to work or in the evening.  This is NOT where you want to go midday.  

Took daughter and her friend there at 2pm and that was mistake.  There was a pretty serious line of 5 people in front of me and at least 10 people in the room already having ordered drinks.  I would say that we easily waited over 20 minutes to get our drinks and the order was wrong b/c the cashier keyed it in wrong.  Also, someone stole another person's drink.  Felt bad for the manager(ish) guy who had to make another drink.  If you see a line, try back another time.  Smoothies are too time consuming to make when there are too many people in there."}
{"text":"Friday night, 7:30, not busy at all. Ordered two of the immunity boost smoothies (yay for winter colds)   Counter service was awesome, it didn't take long to get our order. Smoothies themselves were just ok, a little too tart for my taste, but the kid behind the counter was so sweet and hoped that we felt better when he delivered our order. I found that to be the extra star for this review :)"}
{"text":"Honestly was very impressed. Wasn't expecting much based on reviews but I loved it. I was immediately greeted and my order was accurate. The smoothies are huge... 20 or 24 oz cup. I got the chia banana cacoa one. It was seriously delicious. $7 but it is enough for a meal. I'd go back."}
{"text":"The smoothies are always very delicious here! Very good customer service, especially from Brandon!"}
{"text":"Alejandra who took my order was very polite but the people who make these smoothies ... oh man i didn't think it would take so long to make . I purchased at 12:30 didn't get it til 12:55 ..... like really"}
{"text":"Came in and every time service is extremely slow, the people working go to the back and will be on their phones.  Some days are great service and other days out shine the good.  Wish customer service was better cuz it really is a awesome concept."}
{"text":"They got my order wrong and I called multiple times to just have them not pick up and not even have a voicemail. I hung up the third time after 10 MINUTES of not answering. So now I'm out my lunch order money and couldn't even talk to an employee to make it right. Obviously shows there lack of dedication to customers and efficiency if they didn't even know there phone wasn't working, or maybe they want it that way! Either way I'm irritated and will never give this location my business. Very upsetting."}
{"text":"Horrible service, there was no one there besides me and my friends and it took them 10 minutes to come to the counter to order one smoothie. Also the floors where trashed and dirty, explained why they have a C."}
{"text":"I do not like white sauces on my food and when I ordered it WITHOUT the white sauce, it still came to me with it on the food. We had a long conversation about substituting the white sauce for a Thai Peanut sauce, and they even let me sample it before they completed my order. However, the cook apparently had trouble reading and interpreting the order.  I got home to discover white sauce all over the food. He smoothie was fantastic, non issues there!  Prices are okay. But, I would like to see management train the cooks on proper order preparation."}
{"text":"Honestly I love their smoothies, but for some reason this location is slower than a snail stuck in molasses. There only ever seems to be one to two people working and either way inside or drive thru takes at least 20 minutes to get your order. Absolutely absurd."}
{"text":"Great service at this place all the time.  They remember my order from previous visits.  

Don't be fooled by the name of it being only a smoothie place.  They have great food as well.  I usually like to get the Thai Salad with a Smoothie!!"}
{"text":"Every time I come in here they are always so slow and I feel like they are so understaffed especially for lunch rushes. When I visited there today they had two people working; one at the cashier and one person making food and smoothies. The line was out the door and there were about 10 people already sitting and waiting for food and/or smoothies. The girl at the register couldn't even start making smoothies because she was ringing everyone up. It isn't the employees fault, it's managements for not having enough people working to help them. Overall it took me 40 minutes to get my one smoothie I ordered while on my lunch break from work. Absolutely ridiculous and I'm highly annoyed."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's super nice that they have a drive-thru and the food is consistently delicious. Service is a little slow especially in the drive-thru but it's never too bad and the staff is very friendly. I'm really glad to have them in the neighborhood for a quick and tasty meal."}
{"text":"We finally got a Tropical Smoothie Cafe in the N Scottsdale area!  This little gem opened up in April 2014, and I have since made my way through every low-fat smoothie (vegans, don't forget to omit the yogurt from the smoothies that list it).  

My favorite smoothies are:
Mango Magic (sans yogurt) & Hawaiian Breeze (sans yogurt) - both are great and refreshing following a work-out or a 5 second walk from your car to the store in the summer; same sweaty difference. 

Acai Berry Boost - one of the \"Supercharged\" smoothies for when I need a morning pick-me-up. It's vegan.

The Blimey Limey (a sweet meet tart taste) and the Kiwi Quencher (sans yogurt; has a Starburst-y flavor) are my other 2 go-to flavors.

These 24 oz smoothies are a filling breakfast for me, and they're currently 1/2 off the price during their 7am-9am happy hour (8am-9am on weekends), so I get breakfast for less than $2.50!  

A list of supplements are available to add to your smoothie.

They also have breakfast wraps, but these are not vegan, so I haven't tried them. 


For lunch or dinner, they have flatbreads, toasted wraps, sandwiches, and salads, AND they offer Beyond Meat \"chicken\" as a vegan replacement option in these items.
The Thai \"Chicken\" wrap is very tasty and vegan as is (when ordered w/ Beyond Meat, of course). 
The Southwest \"Chicken\" wrap is also good. Omit the ranch dressing if you're vegan.
The Jamaican Jerk \"Chicken\" (sans cheese) is tasty, but their jerk sauce is not as spicy as I'd like.

The wraps are large. There is a 1/2 wrap, 1/2 smoothie option as well.  

They sell chips, and baked varieties are available. Fruit is also available as a side. 

The employees are always nice and helpful. Unfortunately, they aren't very knowledgeable about the ingredients. Apparently, this information just isn't readily available to them. (They couldn't tell me if there was dairy in their buffalo sauce.)

Sign up for text messages and receive random deals. You may order online.

Location: off of Mayo Blvd, west of N Scottsdale Rd, in the Scottsdale 101 shopping area. Shares the parking lot w/ Red Robin, Chick-Fil-A and it's next to Starbucks and the Subway.

Rather small location. I think there are 5 or 6 tables inside. There is only 1 outdoor table."}
{"text":"I don't know why but I seem to always crave smoothies on Sundays.  I always enjoy them, but seem to forget until Sunday when most smoothie places are closed; so this place being open on Sunday is a huge plus for me.

I got the Paradise Combo, which is a sandwich/wrap, a smoothie, and a side for $10.  Buffalo wrap and mango/pineapple smoothie were both very good, and at $10 I thought a good deal.  Their smoothies seem to be slightly more on the healthy side with ingredients like non-fat yogurt as opposed to sorbet or ice cream, but the flavor is certainly not lacking.

I am sure I will be returning the next time I have a Sunday smoothie craving."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's very close to my house and open 24 hours! The staff is always friendly and fairly quick. Drive thru normally mods faster, so I suggest not going inside. I love the green smoothies and flatbread sandwiches. Consistency seems to be lacking sometimes but the taste is always good!"}
{"text":"I have a hard time writing a bad review, but this place is consistently terrible. We we're not greeted, they take a while to acknowledge you, and the restaurant is just dirty. The bathrooms look like they haven't been cleaned in weeks. The employees seem to not enjoy what they do, based on the attitude and the way they come across when talking to you."}
{"text":"Nice people and great food. My humus wrap came out ! Soda machine was down but who needs soda anyway!"}
{"text":"The greatest place in the world for smoothies and They are half off if you get there early enough. Customer service is always great haven't tried the food but I will one day. Keep up the good work. Definitely try the island green"}
{"text":"Spent over 40 minutes in the drive thru for two smoothies. I ended up just driving away because I wasn't greeted once I got to the window."}
{"text":"Zero sense of urgency. All the staff women sit in the back and gossip about random nonsense non business related. Get your a$$ to work, other people have things to do. And thanks for putting sugar in my shake when I specifically asked for none. So much sugar in this smoothie, it might put me in a diabetic coma and I'm not even diabetic. This is ridiculous, FIRE EVERYONE!!!!"}
{"text":"This is probably the worst tropical smoothie in vegas! The store is never staffed adequately, it looks dirty and the people working there look dirty too which is a huge turn off. Horrible customer service too. Won't be back until management gets its stuff together."}
{"text":"3 stars is a stretch for this place. I'm giving 1. The manager at this location is very rude and unprofessional. Most of the employees seem they would be a better fit then himself. Service here is terribly slow and they are always understaffed during the lunch hour. With several large employers around this location you think they would staff more then 2 people over the lunch hour during the week. I can't even make it in and out of this place in under 30 minn for a damn smoothie! Very good smoothies but they just fail when it comes to service! I have even tried calling in to go orders several different times. They have never once answered the phone. Get new management before people stope going to this place all together. Many of my coworkers who have also visited this place have had the same unpleasant experience. :) Good Luck!"}
{"text":"Beyond disappointed with service. Waited over 30min to be attended. The only worker was beyond slow & very inattentive. On top of that, I waited another 30min to get my food. Such a shame because I love tropical smoothie."}
{"text":"Stay away from this place. They under staff MAJORLY. I waited in the drive thru line for 35 minutes with 3 cars ahead of me. The poor employee working was taking the order, making the food & smoothies. LEARN HOW TO STAFF YOUR BUSINESS!! I will never come back again."}
{"text":"Slow service, staff undertrained and overwhelmed, not that great of a smoothie. Either management hires more staff or reduce prices. Won't be going here for a while if ever."}
{"text":"Love Tropical Smoothie and I am so glad that this one opened down the street from my house. Although, this location seems to be very slow with making the smoothies/food. Do not go if you are in a rush because you never know how long you are going to be stuck there for."}
{"text":"I was just there Saturday night and the 
Drive Thru supposed to closed at 10:00pm  I got there at 9:39 pm and a Girl was mopping inside came to the window and told me they were closed. I told her you still have 20 more minutes right? And she just started at me and said I'm cleaning up. So she didn't take my order. I wonder if anyone (Management) read the bad reviews this Location has. Not to mention they NEVER have the Online Orders Ready. And in the mornings they Open late."}
{"text":"Having kind staff only gets you so far when you don't know what you're doing. This place is way more pricey than any other tsc but the overall quality is NOT worth it. And they tend to mess up on something everytime. One time I got a smoothie with almost 2 inches missing out of it but the wait was so long I took it anyways.  I would recommend the tsc on lake mead and buffalo, WAY better price and food is consistently delicious."}
{"text":"No stars if I can...I vowed not to return to this store after last couple bad experiences. My staffs were there and they wanted to order some smoothies for the office. About an hour later, they wanted to cancel the order and walk out. Then an employee rushed to make the smoothies and they all came out HORRIBLE!!! This place is going down very very quickly...sad to say."}
{"text":"Not just for smoothies, I originally came in for tacos that looks so delicious.  A brand new place that is nice and clean, it has great menu with reasonably priced sandwiches that are quite creative. Their biggest plus in my eyes is the smoothies, I had one of their avocado smoothies that was delicious. their sandwiches are really good, they also have Panini's, flatbread, wraps and tacos. All made fresh to order, they also have combos that are very reasonably priced. Under $10 for a sandwich & a smoothie, you also get a side which I think it's a real bargain considering the freshness of the food. The sides are similar to that sub shops , much healthier however. I had to Santa Fe flat bread which was fairly tasty with chicken, sauce and lots of lettuce it came with the 20 ounce smoothie which was wonderful. My friend had the chicken and bacon sandwich on a Ciabata and a Blueberry smoothie, she asked for a cookie. Her part of the order was more expensive than mine for some reason, i specifically asked for The 1/2 sandwich and smoothie deal. Make sure you do too if that's what you want, be clear!"}
{"text":"The wheels have completely come off at this location. I used to frequently eat here and now there is absolutely no consistency with the food quality. The other day they switched out feta cheese for blue cheese and my wrap looked like it was made by Helen Keller. The employees are completely disorganized and there appears to be no management. Definitely not worth the money or the long wait."}
{"text":"Love going here for lunch! Staff is sometimes rude but there's a gentlemen that I dealt with today and now I must give him a good review. He's so pleasant and very informational. They don't wear name tags so I have no clue what his name is :("}
{"text":"This is the kind of place we need on every corner....not mcdonalds, not cookout, not even starbucks.  I was so sad when Natural Blendz closed down but this is a great alternative (although not nearly as close to me).  

Great smoothie options, wraps, salads, flatbreads, etc.  Everything is fresh and tasty.
I love the fact that you can go super healthy with the likes of an avocado, cucumber and spinach smoothie or you can go \"dirty\" and just get a peanut butter and chocolate treat.  

We ordered a flatbread and the thai chicken wrap which both came with a small side.  I tried the kale and apple salad for my side and it had a homemade dressing on it.  It was very good.  The portions were perfect for a hot sunny day in Charlotte.  It was just the perfect lunch and you can wash it all down with one of their fruity smoothies.  

It was PACKED in there on Saturday at 1pm (prime time) so be prepared to wait a little.  They really don't have the space for the amount of volume coming in and out of there so it was warm and a bit uncomfortable.  We got our food to go and that was ideal.

Friendly service and they did the best they could to keep up with the crowds.  I'm sure they could have been a little more efficient but that is something that management can work out with them.  Overall, good spot.  Great healthy options.  I will be back."}
{"text":"Food is usually pretty good, way understaffed usually wait 30-40 mins for something.  No one is ever at the counter, only reason I go is cause its close to work"}
{"text":"I had been craving a fruit smoothie and went to my Yelp app to find the closest one to me. This one was close by, so I decided to stop in. First of all, it looked like it wasn't even open. There were no cars parked in front and only one person was inside and it was a homeless man. The two employees inside were talking about how he shouldn't be in there, but I was thinking he might as well be in there; hell, he's your only customer. He did have a drink that he had bought and all his stuff laid out on the table and was listening to music and dancing in his seat, but for the most part, he was harmless and kept to himself. 

Some young kid was the only one in there when I arrived and his coworker came in a little while after. Both acknowledged me, which I was surprised about, given the massive amounts of negative reviews. There were a few cars in the drive thru and he said he'd be right with me, which was fine, because it gave me time to figure out what I wanted. I ended up ordering the Sunrise Sunset. While it was good, it wasn't \"blow your socks off\" good. It was blander than what I expected. I've been to Jamba Juice and ordered similar items that have had more flavor. I think they are being cheap and using less fresh ingredients and more ice. That's why it was so watered down. I might give them a try, again, but they wouldn't be my first choice for a smoothie, especially when there were 3 other smoothie places in the same shopping center."}
{"text":"Just what we needed in this plaza.. 
Great refreshing feeling from the time you walk in. Staff and store are new but everyone is smiling and excited to welcome you to this healthy new addiction! Wheatgrass shot and Kale Detox.. A lunch well done! Indulge"}
{"text":"Not sure what's going on but sadly the employees representing this location don't seem to care much.. 
Drive thru menu is basically non existant. Windows in the drive through are disgusting and the attitude is so non chalaunt as they hand you your half ass food in a sack that comes prepared with no idea of presentation in mind or care that what they are serving out the window is old and discolored...Regular customer just lost.. Tried to call corporate in Atlanta to report them but got a recoding saying they can't take your call..
Photos are kind of sad.. The owners of this franchise should just let the business go rather than bring down the name!"}
{"text":"Tropical Smoothie Cafe, or \"Trop Smoo\" as I like to call it, has the best tasting smoothies of all the smoothie chains.  And this location does a great job with consistency.  The staff here is super friendly and attentive.  And that makes you feel better after dealing with all those non-friendly people who grace your presence throughout the course of life.  

As far as food/drink, I usually get the Health Nut with whey protein because my guns are constantly begging me for more protein so they can keep growing and busting out of my shirts.  The Health Nut is a concoction of blueberries, mangos, bananas, and almonds (along with the aforementioned protein) and it is creamy delicious and satisfying.

For food, they have an everchanging selection of salads and wraps, but I still haven't found that item that I just can't live without.  When I find it, then Trop Smoo will get upgraded to 5 stars!  

Peace out!  **posing with my hands giving the peace sign while taking a selfie... cause I'm cool like that**"}
{"text":"Yelp says open until midnight. The doors say the lobby is open 8 am - 8 pm. We came a couple of nights ago with the kids after 10 pm and went through the drive through for smoothie's... they told me that the drive through stays open until midnight (as Yelp also stated). Tonight, we drove 20 mins out of our way, because we knew this location was open, arriving at 10:15 pm, to a CLOSED drive through (and lobby). We called, and they answered - saying they were already closed. No offer to put our order through anyway, after we explained that Yelp says they are open, AND, we had been here the other night after 10 pm, and they were open. Sigh... I think we better stick to Jamba Juice. I heard Tropical Cafe adds way more sugar to their smoothies anyway, so probably for the best.  

The shakes were good on night one - but, business practices, not so much."}
{"text":"We walked in here wanting a treat on a hot day.  The place smelled like sewer, they were out of EVERYTHING, and it took forever to get our drinks.

Bright side?  The staff was incredibly kind and apologetic.  Hey manager! It's called IN-VEN-TOR-Y."}
{"text":"This location is beyond messed up. Manager Alexis, is a lowlife piece of crap. He treats his employees with the utmost disrespect and gets emotionally frustrated when they ask him questions on how they become a better employee. I'm am absolutely disgusted by this store and feel bad for all employees working here. They're always running out of food which seems to be yet another manager mistake. I'm a fan of tropical smoothie cafe don't get me wrong but after experiencing this location and hearing how that so called manager talks to his employees i'll be cutting back on my visits and spending at this store and take my sales dollars down the street to the Cheyenne and Buffalo store and I highly advise everyone to do so. This manager needs to be replaced and the only way I can think of doing so without being in the company is having him lose sales at his store. Let's get these workers a new manager."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times to get their smoothies, all which have been pretty good. Last night, we went to get food and they were out of romaine lettuce, which was disappointing. We ordered the Thai Chicken Bowl and the Baja Chicken Bowl...ended up having to turn the Baja Chicken into a wrap, due to the lettuce shortage. We went through the drive thru and it took a LONG time for our food. When we finally got our food, it was switched. The Thai Chicken was in a wrap and the Baja Chicken was in a bowl with the wrong lettuce. We ended up throwing away the bowl, a waste of money. We did get two Banana Chai Max smoothies, which were good, but a little too sweet--even with Splenda. Overall, the food is expensive and not worth the price. I'm not quite sure I will be back."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! I sat at the drive thru (with nobody in front of me) for five minutes before I called the restaurant to ask if someone was going to help me. The girl finally spoke to me and had an attitude the entire time. Never once apologized for me having to wait. Then, as I waited almost ten minutes for my food at the drive thru, the girl helping me disappeared and someone else opened the window not realizing that I already paid, so he asked me for the money. I explained I already paid and he said \"sorry\" and walked away. Definitely not coming here again."}
{"text":"I'm addicted! This Big Momma had the Bahama Momma! Yeah~ #2die4... strawberry, pineapple, white chocolate.. The best. Of course I did add the B-12 and Fat Burner additions because I wanted a pick me up! Seriously for $6 bucks (thermal keepsake cup) perfect for this AZ heat, I was bouncing off the walls.. Not enuff to hit the gym but, I thought about it. With my new thermal cup~ I get a .50 cent discount. Service was excellent:) If these guys add a Groupon~ Lookout!"}
{"text":"I totally forgot to take a picture of the actual smoothie I bought...smh.

But anyways, it was called a \"Paradise Point\" and for someone who has NEVER been here, nor has bought an actual smoothie in his life, it was so delicious. I normally make them at home in the blender or nutri-bullet. I think I've found my new meal replacement when leaning out and watching my calories. I like the fact that they have a nutritional value scale in front of the cash register when you order. This location was pretty clean for the most part. Service with a smile, and the guy who took my order brung my order directly to my table... which I thanked him for. I wonder if they all do that? I'm sure I'll be back to try a few more flavors. Probably will try different locations too."}
{"text":"lol came here for some refreshing smoothies at 3:30am on a Saturday night / Sunday early morning after celebrating my friend's birthday at a pool bbq. We searched up for the closest 24hr location so once we got here, the drive through was closed & blocked off with cones. The lobby had lights on but it didn't look like anyone was in there. We went in to check and stood inside calling for someone, no answer. There was one car parked in front of the entrance & someone was sleeping in there and from outside the window, it looked like a worker. Another customer woke him up and the employee said \"We're closed. The drive through is closed.\" But why would the lobby doors be unlocked if it's closed?? Made no sense. Please take a second look at your staff. Smh."}
{"text":"This place is a joke if I could I would give this place 0 stars but I can't so I have to put 1 star. Its not 24/7 and that's false advertisement. Waited at the door for 15 minutes because it was locked. They had all of the lights on and the music playing loud in the background.They close and open whenever they want to or feel like it. I called the store and no one answered but someone must be there. When they are open they will always ask you what your order was repeatedly and still get your order wrong. Tropical Smoothie is a disappointment overall."}
{"text":"If it were possible to put half a star I would. When I went in to this location tonight there was no customer service whatsoever. There was no human interaction, the cashier stared at me until I ordered. When I asked menu questions, She replied with I don't know, and proceeded to click buttons on the screen until she read me ingredients. Overall the experience was lack luster. If you're craving a smoothie head over to Jamba Juice or a different Tropical Smoothie location. This one isn't worth your time."}
{"text":"I love this location since it is 24/7 and it is drive through. This means we left in our pajamas, of course.
Whoever works there at 2 AM is the best person. Our smoothies were so perfect and so smooth. I didn't feel that I had to crunch down on the ice from a half-a** job of blending neither was it too watery.
I really appreciate you 2 AM staff. You guys know what you are doing to fulfill late night smoothie cravings."}
{"text":"Waited over 20 minutes for our order while the employee literally turned away 6 people telling them that there would be a long wait since only one person was working. How can you possibly operate a profitable business this way?"}
{"text":"Im glad this tropical smoothie is open 24 hours, 7 days a week. I ordered the beach bum with a add of peanut butter i was so addicted to it. I also order the Peanut butter cup smoothie it was just as good. Thankfully they have a drive thru for the people thats lazy to get out the car. 

The lady was a little bit rude, but i understand for someone like me to come in at 1am on a cold night. Im pretty sure she thinks I'm crazy. Lol at the end she was very nice, told me to have a good night. 

My order was correct and on point. I was really satisfied with everything. If you're looking for a quick drink come to this location !"}
{"text":"Went in over the weekend and had a Chia Banana Smoothie with Roasted Bananas - outstanding!  Great lunch spot as well.  Friendly staff - reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Tasty drinks!  I prefer Tropical Smoothie over other smoothie chains (Jamba Juice etc).  I have had a wrap for lunch too, not too bad, but my 5 stars are for the service and the smoothies."}
{"text":"I just moved from VA and this was one of my favorite places to eat out there so I was thrilled to discover on out here in AZ! Sadly, the experience I had this evening might prevent me from every going back. 

When I arrived, there were two employees working behind the counter. One had a name tag that said \"Jackson\", the other was an bored looking girl with bleached blonde hair and no name tag. The bored girl unenthusiastically took my order and then got annoyed when I presented a coupon as though it greatly inconvenienced her to have to enter it in. Jackson stomped around in the background filling orders and just looking generally pissed off. 

I got my smoothie (delicious! One of the stars in my review is strictly for the smoothie) and sat at a table while I waited for my buffalo chicken wrap. As I was sitting, Jackson stomped over and started collecting straw papers off of the table which required him to awkwardly lean over me and had me wondering if I should just get out of his way. Thankfully my decision was made easily when my order was called out. I got up, took my bag, smiled and thanked the bored girl (who didn't smile or offer any pleasantries in return) and headed out to my car to eat because I couldn't take any more of the negativity hovering in that place. 

When I ordered, I had requested no ranch dressing. I opened my wrap....to find the inside completely drenched with dressing. I briefly considered going back inside to have them fix it, but at that point I was not up for dealing with the attitude that I know would have come had I done so I just tried to eat around it (have you every tried to eat around dressing? Yea, a lot of my wrap got tossed out). Minus the dressing, the wrap WAS fresh, hot, and well made so that's where the second star comes from. I still love the food and the smoothies so I may try and give it one more chance, but if I had to decide based on this experience alone, I would absolutely not go back."}
{"text":"This has to be the worst tropical smoothie I've ever been to in regards to service. They are extremely slow. I waited 15 minutes for my smoothie and an additional 20mins for my food. ALL I GOT WAS A WRAP. I needed to get a quick lunch before I went into work and none the less ended up not getting to really eat my lunch because I had to rush to work so I wouldn't be late. They don't apologize for things taking so long and seem not to care. I'll never come to this location ever again. If you need something quick avoid this location. The one in Summerlin is way faster and apologetic if there's any type of wait."}
{"text":"The first time I went to this place to order a kiwi quencher and they said they had no kiwi's then I went today and bought the California with a kiwi quencher. The guy said they didn't have lettuce which was no big deal then I started to drink the kiwi quencher and it was horrible it tasted watery and like it was missing flavor."}
{"text":"Yo dude, your a douche, no man you are a douche. You'll never get laid... 
This is just a sneak peak of the ridiculous conversation I had to listen to while waiting for my sandwich today. The immature zit faced kid that rang me up, kept interrupting my order to banter with his coworker who was just wondering around the store front. I ordered the hummus veggie sandwich and the ONLY reason I gave this sh*t hole 1 star is because my sandwich was awesome. The behavior of these soon to be 40 year old virgins was enough to drive me to 3 Advil and never go back. The older gentlemen in the back who I couldn't figure out what his role was just argued with the teens and cracked lame jokes of his own. I find it impossible to believe that in this horrible economy THAT is the best they can do. 

The highlight of my visit is when the cashier started to mock a car in the lot then had the balls to turn to me and ask if it were mine. HELLO DUMB-ASS, usually you clarify this prior to making fun of it. Not sure if I was supposed to be impressed or what exactly the purpose of this behavior was supposed to prove. If I were the owner of this shop, I would be embarrassed and horrified."}
{"text":"This store was horrible I was not greeted upon coming in. Orders were not right for customers and not only was I never spoken to until I was able to order but the employees don't seem like they know how to do there jobs. Not a pleasant experience I will not be returning and if others are planning to come, think twice"}
{"text":"Usually this place is pretty good, but today was crappy! I get the avocado smoothie and there were huge pieces of avocado at the bottom of my cup. What a waste! There is no way the girl didn't see them when she poured my drink in the cup. The only thing I can say is that it was really busy and she was the only one there."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Tropical Smoothie... Or well, it used to be. Pulled up in the drive thru & was not even greeted with a \"hi.\" Just an attitude and, \"What can I get you?\" Decided to give this girl a chance & told her nicely what I wanted. Told me my total without asking me if that'll be it or whatever. I said thank you without getting a response back. I don't know if they're just busy or whatever but you are NEVER too busy to be polite to someone. Literally sitting in the drive thru right now while these people take their sweet time. I'm going to attempt to get this female's name. 

What's going, Tropical Smoothie? Y'all used to be so bomb dot com. Now you're just full of crappy workers who are lazy as hell & don't want to do their job. 

The owner needs to correct this crap."}
{"text":"Smoothies are good, but it seems that any time of day or night they only have one person making food, making smoothies, taking orders, and doing drive-thru.  Takes FOREVER to get anything!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and after consistently great service, friendly and professional staff, and great food, it was time to give them the Full Five Stars. 

First thing, the staff is just great. Every time I've been here, a young lady (with black-rimmed glasses) has served me and she is just great. Super friendly and provides professional service.

The smoothies are great. Amazing choices and great unusual combinations you don't see often. Then I combine a smoothie with half a sandwich and their sandwiches are just great. I feel like the bread and ingredients are of better quality and fresher than other restaurants. I am always left wishing I just got a whole sandwich with my smoothie. 

Finally the price, it's great! It makes the place a gem. I have tried out other places in the same block before shopping (don't go shopping on an empty stomach) and this is the best for price, exceptional food and smoothies quality, efficient service, and clean seating.

Suggestions for improvement: expand outdoor seating. Almost choose another place nearby because they have great outdoor seating on this beautiful evening, but their food just wasn't as good. So came here again and then to write this review. They have two tables, but if they could expand it, I think they will do better for themselves and make it more enjoyable for customers.

Keep it up guys, doing great. You will continue to have my business in the future."}
{"text":"I gotta give a special shout out to Ashley who was working tonight all by herself! She handled making smoothies and food like a champ. Yeah, I had to wait 25 minutes for my order but I blame the owners of this store for under staffing. This young lady deserves a raise or she should find greener pastures! I hope this owners wake up and get a clue that when it's hot outside, people want a cold smoothie. Now hire some more help!!!"}
{"text":"The ratings are for this particular store only. I have experienced much better tasting smoothies at a couple other Tropical Smoothie locations here in town.

I've been to this location a few times. Usually close to their closing time as it is on my way to work (I work graveyard shift). I have really tried to give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe it's just because they are not properly staffed towards closing time, but service is really slow here and the staff seem indifferent in the way they greet customers. I know it's close to closing time but at least welcome and say hello to me before asking what I want. And the last couple times I have ordered a particular smoothie, it taste different from the same smoothies made at other Tropical Smoothie stores I have been to in town. I'm going to stop going to this location."}
{"text":"Good smoothies the only down fall is every now and then when they open certain items are out.  Other then that real good drinks and food is healthy choices"}
{"text":"Decent food, but the wait got worse every time I went there, seem to hire an inordinate amount of kids that don't understand the concept of decent customer service, my last trip saw the girl who waited on me proceed to come from behind the counter to literally throw water on her friend, in the process she forgot to take my order and after 35 mins it dawned on me that she had forgotten."}
{"text":"I love Tropical Smoothie and I was so excited about this location opening up because it is the first TS to open up on the east side of town, but they are too understaffed in my opinion. 

I have used the drive-thru twice and both times I have had to wait 15+ minutes. The first time I went, the person taking orders was having trouble hearing what I was saying through the speaker and apparently was having trouble recording orders because my order seemed to be too confusing to be served correctly. The second time, there was only one person managing the drive-thru and the front - ONE person. 

My smoothies always come out tasting delish, I just wish they came out in a more timely manner. Haha."}
{"text":"we went in here for a after Pilate's for a healthy dinner. We were greeted by two boys that were 12ish. We gave our orders to go and sat down at the table. We then got a show we did not pay for one of the boys had his girlfriend in the shop and they proceeded to have some public displays of affection right in front of the counter...i lost my appitite.Good thing we had to drive a ways to get home.
that being said I ordered the chicken salad sandwich and a cup of there soup of the day. Yuck the soup was canned and terrible. the chicken salad was okay but i looked up the calories on line and it was almost 800 calories for this healthy sandwich.DONT GO HERE.It was $11 dollars for a sandwich and soup and a soda."}
{"text":"Yikes! 

I was happy to see the new concept sign out front. I've been wanting to check out the new Cafe concept since I've heard great things about it. 

Right when I walk in, I'm slammed by HOT air. There is NO air conditioning and the employees look miserable. When you have miserable/hot employees, you get crappy very slow service. 

The cleanliness of the store was disgusting! The glass separation was streaked from a dirty wash rag, the mop bucket was sitting out in clear view of guest, and there was trash everywhere. The employee had to move a box on the counter to reach the Whey and Oats for my smoothie. 

I wasn't sure if I wanted to order food for fear it would be contaminated or unhealthy. I went ahead and order due to my increasing hunger. The chipotle chicken club flatbread had 3 pieces of chicken in it! Yup, 3! 

I will not be back to this location or recommend it. Management needs to show up, train their employees, get the AC fixed and make sure the place is presentable."}
{"text":"Thy were disrespectful, and rude. They talked to me as if i were their friend. Oh and after they took my order they said they didn't have the ingredients."}
{"text":"*Customer Service 0/2 Stars, This needs some serious work. Been here multiple times now and have yet to have a good customer service experience. It's nice to see younger adults having the opportunity here but they need to work on customer service. Was just here and the girl taking our order had attitude because she had to take a second order from us that I had to wait on because she thought she was done after the first order. Note I waited patiently with no problem while she took two drive thru orders before getting back to me. 

*Experience 0/1 Star, The place is clean and not very busy however the sustainer service is never pleasant here. 

*Food 1/1 Star, Smoothies here are great when they make them right. I will admit one employee here doesn't know what he's doing and makes them noticeable watered down with no flavor. 

*Would I Recommend 1/1 Star, yes but only for the smoothie and food. The customer service here needs serious work..."}
{"text":"Worst place ever.  It's almost like whoever owns this franchise is trying to make it fail.  You're lucky if you go here and there's more than one person working.  I'm only writing this to ask that can someone please sell this franchise to someone that will run it please.  Thanks"}
{"text":"I always get the detox smoothie, no ginger, and half the normal mango and pineapple to cut down sugar. 

The cute/ young girl working the register was super sweet and accommodating. I called ahead, which is paramount... For some reason service tends to be a little slower at this chain. 

I haven't tried any other food besides this smoothie. $5 for a big A smoothie without preparing and cleaning a blender is a no brainer. 

Only complaint is that the bathrooms are nastay"}
{"text":"Got the detox Smoothie- lowest sugar and calories. No one else in the store, super quick and yummy! Love that there is only 1 size. Will be back!"}
{"text":"We came here after a hike on a warm day. They have more than just smoothies here, but today we just got smoothies. I got a 12 ounce with strawberry, pineapple, orange juice and lime. It hit the spot. The smoothie was cold and refreshing. Next time I'll get the lo-cal smoothie made with Splenda. We sat inside which was annoying due to the noisy smoothie machine running every 30 seconds. We will be back after another hike and maybe try one of their sandwiches."}
{"text":"I rarely stop in here, even though it is close to my house.

I don't find the staff to be very fast or friendly. My orders seem to take FOREVER, regardless how many other people are in the restaurant.

Everything is a bit overpriced, and although the selection is decent, I could make this stuff at home (I guess that generally applies to any place).

Overall, I just never even seem to remember that this place exists.  Which just reminds me that I'm just not that in to you, Tropical Smoothie."}
{"text":"This is a poorly-run Tropical Smoothie they were out of chicken they did not pick up their phone I asked for splenda in both my smoothies which they did not put in (tasted like blended fruit water) and they made us wait 15 minutes in the drive thru and that was after waiting 5 minutes just to put the order in (let me just mention that there was only one car in front of us all that time) and when I came in to get my refund the redhead girl that made the smoothies flat out denied making a mistake, didn't offer to fix it, just argued that the smoothies were fine....even to her manager... Poor customer service and bad smoothies"}
{"text":"I frequent 3 different tropical smoothie places and this one has the best food quality out of them all. If I want to make sure that my sandwiches and smoothies are going to come out perfect I go to this location. However they are a bit impersonal. I blame it on the manager because he seems to be very anal and OCD, it will drive you crazy trying to do it a pick up order over the phone if you do not follow his phone order criteria. That being said if you order a smoothie over the phone be prepared to answer  the following question \"sugar or splenda sugar or splenda sugar or splenda?\" One last note, the layout of this location is pretty nice and well kept so overall this is one of the best tropical smoothies in Las Vegas, and they're open 24 hrs"}
{"text":"I went to purchase a smoothie today and decided to order a wrap also. As you stand at the counter you can see to the back where they make the food. I was the only customer in there at the time, After I paid for my order a lady came in and ordered and told me that the person making my food had just sneezed on it, she then left, I moved to the side so that I could see through to the back properly, and there was the person making my wrap coughing all over it not even covering his month, he then wiped his nose on the back of his hand and then spat on the floor. I cancelled my order and the manger had to come to the front to refund me. He was really stroppy about it, I told him what I had seen and he continued to give me an attitude. I have been here a few times and never had this kind of experience previously. After today I will definitely not be going there again"}
{"text":"Hey guess what if your an Lvac member you get 10 % off your order and make sure you ask for D she's the best...."}
{"text":"I Invited my friend to come try out this location. The cashier Alvin was fantastic I really enjoyed talking to him. They messed up on our smoothies. The location was deserted. Both of our smoothies were wrong. We finally got our order and the smoothies tasted like crashed ice or even like a watered down slushy. Overall I wouldn't go back again. I was embarrassed to have taken my friend to this location. I have gone to other locations and this one just was the cherry on top. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Usually make it to this location after attending Gracie Jiu jitsu class up the street.  Love the smoothie and flatbread combo which is my go to.  Try the detox island green and chicken pesto flatbread for a quick healthy snack.  Location is quite convenient for this busy area and plenty of other restaurants and shops in the shopping center.  I've been to other locations in town including flamingo and Decatur and jones and 215 and they are all pretty consistent with their food and smoothies.  Nice selection of wraps, sandwiches and flatbreads but having the same ones too often does get quite boring so switch it up a bit.  The detox island green is naturally sweetened with spinach, kale, mango, pineapple, banana & fresh ginger!  I've had the mango magic which is quite refreshing if you're a mango lover.  The grilled chicken on brioche looks quite delicious so I'll be trying one next time!"}
{"text":"Obviously no one cares at this place the customer service is ridiculously!! Had to wait 20min I'm drive thru line no one came to attend... went inside and all these young kids that are working there were just playing around.. I was calling and one would answer..obviously the owner doesn't care about this place or it's ratings.. no wonder it only has 2starts.."}
{"text":"This is my second time at this location and every time we get our smoothies they taste water down and when I asked them why is it like that it's because they only use half sugar because they're either running out and that's with their manager suggest that they do. I don't pay $11 for two smoothies every time I come to get half of what I pay for. Once I asked them to remake it it taste better"}
{"text":"The smoothies are not bad only come here for the buy 2 get 1 free between 5-7. Otherwise its just ok if you're looking for a spur of the moment smoothie i would come here other then that no."}
{"text":"Sadly this is under new management and it's a mess. Signs are crooked. Trash on floor. Trashcan overflowing. Out of product. It's definitely gone downhill. Sad.  It used to be run so well 

Update: just went again after 5 months. Wanted to see if they got their act together. And nope! Girl texting while working. Ordered my daughters favorite buffalo chicken sandwich. Out of chicken!! I asked what is going on! She said they have no general manager. I'd stay away. No one monitoring food storage. Girl looked frazzled. They need to close before someone gets sick."}
{"text":"Hidden gem! Can't believe I live a half mile away, and missed this location for the past 4 months! Inside is very clean and nicely decorated. Staff is friendly, and helpful."}
{"text":"Not sure how there are so many locations open here in Vegas since all the reviews seem to be mediocre at best and I couldn't agree more. 

Not a big smoothie person to begin with but there is a deliciously great smoothie place on lake mead called Berry Blendz. The fruit is fresh, they have a huge menu and different size options and I would go there any day. 

Because it's hot and I love Berry Blendz, I decided to try Tropical Smoothie. What a waste. The location is a new one, although they must have transferred the Yelp page over bc the reviews/ pics are from the previous location. The interior of this one is new and clean and refreshing and has a drive thru. 

There were three employees working all moving at glacial speed. I sat down at the bar top right next to the cashier but everyone behind the counter continued to just do their thing before anyone acknowledged me or took my order. I watched a girl make someone's sandwiches slower than I've ever seen anything in my life. 

The smoothies come in one size which in my option is stupid bc who needs a smoothie that big. But anyway, I was still excited to try it. I watched the employee make it which included ice, the smallest amount of fruit I've ever seen and tap water that was running from the sink they had going. My smoothie was so bland and flavorless. It was like blended ice with juice. And then I had this huge thing of it to drink for $6. 

Perhaps it was just this experience and others would be different although based on the reviews overall, I get the sense this experience  is pretty common. 

No thanks :)"}
{"text":"There are many smoothie places out there but this is my new favorite! Their Chia banana boost with peanut butter is where it is at:) the cinnamon, dates and coconut really add a nice flavor to it. If you are not a smoothie person you should check it out because they also have wraps, bowls, flat bread sandwiches and a good kids menu."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Ordered food and a smoothie sat down too eat and never received my smoothie then didn't make my order correct so went up and had to even let them know my smoothie wasn't received after about 25 mins. Wasn't even offered a refund. Just a \"sorry\"."}
{"text":"This has been the only time Tropical Smoothie has been such a letdown. I went through the drive-thru and had to repeat my order 7 times before they got the order correct. My loaded spinach salad didn't even look like it was made with spinach. The leaves were not fresh, and looked as if it had been sitting out for hours. 

Poor quality and poor customer service. Not worth the wait. I would have liked to bring it up to their manager, just so they're aware, but I left as quickly as I could."}
{"text":"This was my first time ordering from this location. I ordered the Jetty punch with energizer. It was awful! I was on my way to an appointment so I couldn't come back, but I called to let them know that the bananas they were using were bad. At least, that's what it tasted like. The girl proceeds to tell me the \"Energizer\" is BITTER in flavor. I think it's curious that they would make a BITTER boost to go into a sweet smoothie.  If that is true, I would think you would tell your patrons that it's going to change the flavor.  

I am surprised they didn't offer to re-make it for me, since I was clearly not happy. I will not be visiting this establishment anymore and will tell everyone know to steer clear!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service and slow. Staff needs to spend time cleaning, not talking. This is our second trip and there won't be a third."}
{"text":"Their Smoothies are to die for. The store is clean, employees usually nice and helpful. Great feeling overall.

Did i mention their smoothies are AWESOME!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars I would. Absolutely bad service. This place is shameful. I hope someone in corporate reads this message. There is no class at this location. Go to the west side and get better service. I've been waiting 45 minutes and still here. There is a line of people and the worker just locked the door to avoid more people walking in. I wish I could just get my money back!"}
{"text":"My smoothie was prepared and ready in less than 5 minutes and blended perfectly. I haven't had too many pleasant experiences with Tropical Smoothie Cafe with customer service or the wait time. But I haven't had that issue with this location. Also, the hours are great!! I work a late shift and don't get off until about midnight and the hours are so convenient."}
{"text":"Forget my previous review. Why do so many TSC locations have sh*tty service? It's always slow as muck.  

I got in the drive thru line when I got a phone call marking the time at 11:30am. I ordered, drove up, and it's now 11:59 and I'm still behind one car (total of four cars including myself). Hell, I'm writing the review and I'm still in line. 30 minutes! Thirty!

I hate/love TSC. The best one I've been to is on Cheyenne and Buffalo. Go there.

Update: oh man, when I finally got to the window, she goes, \"What did you want again?\" LOL"}
{"text":"They gave me the wrong order! The smoothie tastes too sweet..the pasta  salad has too much mayo. This wrap is tasteless and taste like everything was canned."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the selection of food here. They had wraps, sandwiches and salads, which were all great options for an after workout meal. I ended up getting the Thai Chicken Salad and an Avocolada Superfood Smoothie. With the combo I chose, you got a smoothie and half of either a salad, a sandwich, or a wrap. I thought the salad would be small, maybe enough for a light snack. However it turned out to be a good sized meal, especially with the smoothie on the side.
My favorite part was the avocolada smoothie! It had avocado, pineapple, spinach, kale, coconut and lime- it was delicious! It was a little on the sweet side, but nothing that would stop me from getting it again! Ever since I went there, I've been asking coworkers and friends if they've tried this drink, and recommending them to do it if not!
I stopped in after 10pm, and there was no one else there when I arrived. The service was quick, and not super friendly at first. It was probably the end of a long shift, and I'm sure she was tired. But once we started up a conversation, the girl working behind the counter became much more friendly and talkative.
my only complaint would be that as I sat down at one of the tables to wait for my food, I realized that the cleanliness around the café wasn't as great as I would've liked. There was trash on some of the tables, and the surfaces didn't look particularly clean, nor did the trash can lids you had to touch to drop in your trash. But being a restaurant manager myself, these are details I noticed that maybe many others would not have."}
{"text":"Not the best chicken salad sandwich. The menu says it is toasted though mine wasn't and there's hardly anything on it. Just a floppy disappointment. I won't bother returning. The smoothie doesn't taste like it used to either. Blah."}
{"text":"Love tropical smoothie, but every time I try to go to this location when I am in the area on Sunday mornings mornings, they are closed. It's not even like I'm going at an unreasonable time, either. It's usually between 8 and 9 am. I go though the drive thru and no one is there, and all the chairs are up on tables inside. This has happened three times now. If you are going there on a Sunday, I would recommend calling ahead to make sure somebody be is there! Also if you are going to advertise being open 24/7, maybe don't if you don't plan on being open 24/7?"}
{"text":"Baja wrap doesn't have avocado in it even though it says so on the menu. The man was rudely adamant about it and gaslighting when i pointed out that it's on the menu, saying that I was acting mad and irrational about it. I don't think it's more irrational than the menu saying one thing and the employee saying another thing. 

Food was OK but smoothies taste oddly diluted."}
{"text":"It is nice that they offer their smoothies with Splenda.  There are many options under 250 calories and they're even 24 oz, not 16 oz like Jamba Juice."}
{"text":"Terrible service and attitude towards customers and very disgusted with the way they make the food because I've had the buffalo chicken wrap multiple times and Was very good but at this location for some reason never satisfied me I do not recommend this location in particular."}
{"text":"this location is very convenient. the smoothies are good the majority of the time. however, their service can be improved. i'm not quite sure why they don't care about their customers. just because it's not a five star restaurant doesn't mean you can give bad service. there's like 3 of them in the back and it's not busy. however, i waited like five minutes at the register until someone came and took my order. they could at least greet you and say \"i'll be right with you.\" instead of just going on with their day. two of them were in the back and they were just talking. as a customer we don't know if you're actually busy doing something or if you're just lazy and talkative. so you should at least greet and let us know you'll be right with us. and if you decide to be chatty with your coworkers at least be discreet about it. don't be so loud as if you're at a social event."}
{"text":"Really yummy smoothies, but the employees here are always so unfriendly and uninviting."}
{"text":"How is this place still in business?  In addition to having the absolute slowest service they're always out of everything.  Order a Peaches & Silk on a Wednesday afternoon \"We're out of peaches right now\" order a smoothie with coffee \"We're out of coffee right now\" in the miraculous event that they have the ingredients to the smoothie you want, expect to spend 30 minutes waiting even if you're the only person in line at the drive through."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the chain, but have faced challenges with some of them being mismanaged... translating to poor service. This location, however, was very clean and had great service. My order was prepared quickly and I was on my way. As always, the food/smoothies were superb. Well done!"}
{"text":"Kiwi quench is what I tried today very refreshing and not too sweet .the girls work here is super friendly and high energy . I will come another day for the wraps"}
{"text":"I decided to stop here for lunch on national flip flop day and grab a free smoothie and a bite to eat. 

I drive by this place fairly often and have never gone in. 

The promotion was for a good cause (I forget the charity), but it's a tax write off for the company and a smart way to attract new customers like me. 

My pita was pretty good and only $4.50. The free strawberry something smoothie wasn't bad either. It wasn't as flavorful as jambalaya juice, bit I don't normally have strawberry smoothies so I can't compare it to anything. 

Since I drafted this last year, a Jamba Juice opened down the street and I'll likely never return. I like Jamba better"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE. I used to come here about once a week and my smoothies were amazing and I would always get the beach bum one  white chocolate in it always tasted so good!! then about last month they would keep getting my orders wrong every single time, or they would be out of strawberries or white chocolate! this happened almost every single time I came! and then when I would get my beach bum with white chocolate they would mess up and put dark chocolate it is disgusting!!! this has happened so many times I'm so mad and i've wasted so much money here !!!! oh and last time I came my smoothie was made in 5 seconds and tasted like straight ONION ! this place used to be good but now I don't even want to rate it 1 star 


p.s I NEVER write bad reviews 


worst place in the entire world"}
{"text":"I like this location, which is across from the Hard Rock Hotel and is open 24/7, YES I said 24/7! How cool is that? So, if I get a craving for a smoothie at 3am, I can satisfy that and even do the Drive Thru!

It was my first time here and Im glad I stopped in. Very clean and smelled nice.
I did not realize that they only offer one size for the smoothies.. $5.99. And, yes the smoothie is twice the size as a smoothie for the same price at Jamba Juice. I thought that was awesome.

I had the strawberry/banana protein and my friend had the pomegranate smoothie. Both were super delicious. I would say that two people could share one of these as the size is enormous! Variety of menu choices from juices, smoothies, sandwiches and much more. All moderately priced.  

24/7 with a Drive Thru! Only in Las Vegas.."}
{"text":"This tropical smoothie is terrible! Shawn here has a terrible attitude. This smoothies here are not as thick as other locations. You have so many choices near by. I will skip this location."}
{"text":"Truly a terrible experience ...
The smoothies we ordered were fine. But the dishonesty and service were epically bad. 

A month ago I purchased two smoothies. I was charged 7 different times over the next two weeks:

Called repeatedly and phone only answered days later. When someone did answer several days later they said there was no manager . 

Finally I went in and brought my receipt and bank statement. The store was empty and I was asked to wait after the cashier told me it wasn't possible . A woman who appeared to be the manager went outside and sat a patio table without acknowledging me. I asked what was going on to the same cashier who told me I'd have to wait an hour because she was going to be doing an interview soon? What?!!!!!!!
I went outside and called the nearest tropical smoothie franchise and spoke to a polite and professional manager at the red rock location. She called over to ft Apache and Sahara and told me if they didn't get their act together to come her location. I did return and met a very pissed off manager who explained my card was never charged. I showed her my receipt and the bank statement . She finally conceded there was a problem and told me there was a problem with the register.

No apologies. No clear explanation. I had to have my card reissued. Scary!"}
{"text":"Great drinks, fast service. They use a horrible combination of chemicals to clean the store. The employees have gone nose blind to it!"}
{"text":"Been sitting in drive thru for 15 minutes for 1 smoothie.  With 2 cars in front of me.  If the driveway weren't so difficult to back out of I would've.  17 minutes later, my smoothie was wrong! Is this a prank!?"}
{"text":"I walked in and immediately had to leave because there was a weird stench in the room and the whole place was filthy. It's sad because I love tropical smoothie cafe but this location was awful. I basically ran out of there as fast as I could."}
{"text":"One of the best smoothies I ever had. Awesome place. Vibrant music and helpful staff. Can't ask for anything more. Will keep coming back.."}
{"text":"I've been a few times and I have to said I agree with how slow this drive-thru is, every time I go is like 20 min. wait even if there is no cars and I only order 1 smoothie. 
Service is faster if you go inside but don't expect much.
In other words, good service but better have some time to wait for your stuff."}
{"text":"I love Tropical Smoothie, but this one is TERRIBLE!  I waited almost 20 minutes and there was only 1 couple in front of me. She got her drink in about 5 minutes, but his didn't come till about 10 minutes later. There were 5 employees and only 1 making drinks. One I could see mopping in the back and rest were just standing around. When I finally got my drink, I just left and did not try it till I was half way home. It was TASTELESS!!!  No flavor at all. I was so pissed but did not want to drive back. I will never go there again. Also, they were out of whey and I heard them telling a few people after me that they were out of several different kinds of fruits too. Worst Tropical Smoothie in Vegas."}
{"text":"There's always 2 people and it takes 25 minutes just to make a smoothie . I have waited 10 minutes just to order! It's so useless and they don't bother to rush either !!! I'm still waiting now for my smoothie . Let's see how long this will take! Poor service!"}
{"text":"I've always heard of Tropical Smoothie Cafe but never had an opportunity to try it. That was until 98.5 Toy Drive and their sponsorship. We received free smoothie vouchers and gave it a try. We went to this location and had great smoothies. That was last week. This week I decided to try a flatbread with their smoothies and had the Pesto Chicken. It did not disappoint! But what I really want to comment on is the stellar customer service I received from Brianna and Patrick. They went above and beyond and were extremely helpful with everything. This prompted me to go back today and try the recommended smoothie from yesterday. Brianna was there again and did not disappoint. She was very upbeat and friendly. I will be going back!"}
{"text":"First time dining in at the location and was met with great service today from the cashier who greeted us to the lovely super friendly young man that made our PB Cup smoothies. Very friendly workers and very impressed with the staff on this particular visit - 10/19/17 @3pm. The food was great, pretty consistent with other Tropical Smoothie locations, but it is the service that has earned my return business. Kudos"}
{"text":"On the go and keep it fresh! Tropical Smoothie Café prepares a  and tasty meal.  I appreciate the 24 hour schedule and the drive-thru.  On the way to work, it's a stop and go experience. I also appreciate the Under 500 Calorie Menu: We have more than 25 delicious, nutritious smoothies under 500 calories. and Chicken Pesto Flatbread, Baja Chicken Flatbread, and Thai Chicken Salad. There are also Gluten-Free options and you can ask for an accommodation to a chicken based meal to make it vegetarian.  One favorite is the Hummus Veggie Wrap."}
{"text":"First time I've been here months ago service and everything was much better now the past 3 times have been terrible and this last time topped  it being the worst. I asked for the chipotle chicken ranch flatbread with no bacon and they and of course there's bacon. They can't follow simple instructions. Then we're waiting 30 minutes after they serve our food for our smoothies. Then the smoothie was all over the outside of the cup it was an absolute mess!!! Tropical Smoothie is really going to sh**. It's disappointing we use to love having lunch there."}
{"text":"This place is just terrible. Drive through takes about 15 minutes if you're lucky. They got my order wrong so that added another 5 minutes. A different time they asked us what we wanted and we told them, they never replied for like 4 mins so we drove to the second window and they said \"did you get to order?\" So again we waited for them to make the drink an additional 5-7 mins. Just messy. So so messy. Management must be useless here. Another time I overheard the workers whole convo with his coworker because he left the headset on after I ordered. Another time the 2 drinks we got were both watery and tasteless. I've given this place too many chances and they consistently disappoint. So much so I had to come write this long review!"}
{"text":"1 star for the smoothie. The service was horrible! We ordered 2 mango smoothies, which cost $5.49 each. The cashier (maybe she's in her 20's) was nice to the guy before us, but changed demeanor when it was our turn (no \"hi\" or any acknowledgement). When the smoothies are done, she just puts them in the counter and turned around. Unlike when she gave the other guy his order \"thank you\" with a smile and all. I like Tropical Smoothie, but the service is getting worse (the only 2 I liked was the one in Las Vegas Blvd and Blue Diamond)"}
{"text":"The smoothies are delicious as always.  The staff are friendly. The only thing I'm upset about is the food we ordered. We got 2 wraps, the chicken ceasars wrap and Thai Chicken. The ceasars chicken was salty and didn't have enough sauce. For the Thai chicken it was okay. The sauce tasted a bit weird to me. Wish there was more crunchy peanuts."}
{"text":"I love the avocolada!!! My favorite drink in the city. 
Love having this place open 24/7. 
Can't complain. So many options there's something for everyone. Check for their happy hour times... But one get one half off!"}
{"text":"Tropical Smoothie Cafe, why do you even bother having an \"online portal\" where you claim faster service? My order was supposed to be ready at 4:43 p.m. It is now 5:13 p.m. and I am just walking out with my order. Which was incorrect... 

Not even an apology. ?"}
{"text":"The wait to get simple items here is just ridiculous! They seriously need to hurry the pace, had I known it would've taken 30+ minutes to make a sandwhich and a smoothie I would've gone elsewhere. Fix the wait!"}
{"text":"We love Tropical Smoothie and it's a tradition for our family to visit before we hit the road to go back to California. We have visited this location at the end of our trip last time (Nov 2017) and this current time. We should have learned our lesson after the first time. Last time, we sat in the Drive Thru FOR-EVER. We were even sitting in front of the payment/pick-up window. Finally my husband got out of the car IN THE DRIVE THRU) and had to go inside to tell them that we are waiting for our smoothies in the DRIVE-THRU! After he came back and we continued waiting some time. The manager came to the window and said, \"You still haven't gotten your smoothies?!\" She comped them for us. Again, we are sitting at the Drive-Thru and have been waiting for almost a half hour with one car ahead of us. Stuck. 

We are now at the window and they had to take our order AGAIN. It has been yet another 10+ mins waiting for our 3 smoothies. The staff person was less than friendly when re-taking our order. At least she said, \"Sorry for the wait.\" when we eventually got our smoothies. It didn't quite make up for the over 1/2 hour wait. We won't be visiting this location again. Def isn't worth the $19+ price tag and wait time.

When we drove out, we looked and there were no customers inside the cafe."}
{"text":"First time coming to tropical smoothie - ordered a island green and added 2 additional fruits. I asked the young lady who made my drink if it was good this way she said \"no one had retuned it before.\"  My drink turned out horrible - I asked if I could get it remade the manager was fairly rude and told me they do not remake drinks. However, I could purchase another one for another $7. Had I known I was unable to return the drink I wouldn't have ordered it. Needless to say I am very disappointed in the lack of customer service and won't be returning to this store or referring anyone."}
{"text":"I usually love tropical smoothie but this is an awful location. The employees don't care at all about customer service and you have to wait 10+ minutes for someone to come to the register. Nhan N. \"helped\" us, but he has a bad attitude and absolutely doesn't care about what he does. I wanted to use the coupon that's right in front of the register and he makes up something just so he doesn't have to put it into the order. Even if it is true, it doesn't seem like he has the capability to empathize or think about what he's saying. He even overcharged us and I didn't see it until we left. I will never come back to this location which is really sad."}
{"text":"Great cafe! I love this store. Everyone is super nice, the store is clean and I never have a problem with my order. I am ecstatic that they now have awesome veggie smoothies!"}
{"text":"Drive-Thru is painstakingly long, bring some patience when visiting this restaurant. Food was accurate and correct change was given, however there was no apology for the 16 minute drive thru time... :/"}
{"text":"Good smoothies, but they are ALWAYS wrong on change... So unfortunately you have to check that before leaving. One of the guys even used his calculator and still shorted me  Salads and bowls are meh.. haven't tried any of the wraps. Also they are very very veryyyy slow lol"}
{"text":"I decided to wait for the 3rd time this incident happened to me. 3 times Ive come after work and the gym around 2 am drive thru and nobody ever says anything so I sit like an idiot waiting and then drive up to the window to see the employee obviously hiding. It's a female and she half ass makes these wraps anyway they don't even taste as they should. I'm done with tropical smoothie and will be saving money making wraps and smoothies at home. Most nights I even hand out $5 tips as I work for tips so I understand and usually always have cash on me. I'm tired and hungry and I've given this location 3 chances. I'm done. This shouldn't happen to people. LITERALLY WROTE THIS REVIEW WAITING AT THE DRIVE THRU WINDOW. I suggest everyone makes this food and smoothies at home you will be surprised how much money you save."}
{"text":"I've just experienced a rather frustrating and undesirable visit at this TSC location I frequent this location in the past and never experienced an issue. The Store Manager's name is Katy and as I walked  in with my 2 siblings her and the employee that she was working with gave us a look as if they'd rather us not be in the store, I overlooked that as I do experience that often being \"black\" in America smh. But granted I figured I would give them the benefit of the doubt (even though body language is 78% of communication). I asked the cashier in the front if I could use the coupon I had, as I'm apart of your tropical rewards program and have used coupons in the past. The Manager Katy told the Cashier that I could not use the coupon because it was only valid for that day, although the coupon did not specify an expiration or that it was only valid for that day. The coupon read as follows: 

\"Beat the heat with this cool deal from Tropical smoothie cafe!! Buy one 24oz smoothie get one for $1.99!! limit 2 per person, must show text to redeem\" 

 reading this text did not signify a cut off day or expiration as some of the other coupons conveniently mention. I expressed this to Katy and she still refused to serve us with the coupon. I've never been treated with such disrespect at any of their locations until today and I will not return to this location if corporate doesn't do anything I will never return to this smoothie company."}
{"text":"Worst Tropical Smoothie that I have ever been to. I think that any positive review that was received at this location was a mistake and supposed to be for the one across the street at Red Rock Casino. Be prepared to wait an excessively long time and for them to serve the person behind you before you. This place is an embarrassment to the franchise. This is honestly the first negative review that I have written on Yelp, but it is deservingly written."}
{"text":"I usually don't like to leave one star reviews on here, but this place definitely warrants it. It is rather warm in the summer here in Vegas. I have had two separate occasions where I have been stuck at the drive thru window attempting to place an order. I am always told \"hold on\". Both times that this happened, only one vehicle was in front of me. I have my dog in the car with me and she was also starting to get hot. I finally placed my order. 10 minutes later I see a person getting 1 Smoothie. I would have understood if they had 10 smoothies or something crazy. I honestly feel bad for the franchise for being so poorly represented by this location. The blame goes to the owner and/or manager. Personally, this is one of the poorest ran businesses that I have ever seen. I do have to give a compliment that the girl that works overnight does a terrific job and will continue to go there at 4:00 am or 5:00 am. She actually does a good job. If you are not ordering at that time, I would recommend avoiding this business like the plague. Please also read other reviews on here. They seem to be consistent with my experiences."}
{"text":"Great business !!! Any of the bad reviews for this are most likely from the one on Novat St that is down the street. Best Tropical Smoothie in Vegas !!!"}
{"text":"Awesome smoothies! I like tropical more than jamba!

We love that there is a drive-thru for convenience and a military discount :) although their drive-thru display can use some tlc....

I like the hawaiian breeze and my husband likes the sunrise sunset."}
{"text":"I've been to a few tropical smoothie locations and this one is by far the slowest when it comes to service. On my second visit here after stopping by at bachi burger, we waited well over 15 minutes just to order our drinks. The lady working was nowhere to be seen and was taking her time. We were literally standing up at the register for the whole 15 minutes. This was on a Saturday a little after noon. There were at least 7 people behind us waiting to order, 3 of whom left from waiting. It took us another 10 minutes to get our drinks. In total 25 minutes wasted, and we were at the front of the line the entire time. Next time, I'll just stop elsewhere for a drink if I am in this area...."}
{"text":"I have always loved this tropical smoothie location but the past two times I've been in I was extremely disappointed. They changed their new hours to 7pm and my hot yoga workout gets out at 6:45 so I rush over to get a smoothie after, this time in particular I left my class a bit early because I didn't want to miss getting a smoothie, it was 6:53 and I was walking up to the door and they were locking the doors when I got there, thankfully they let me in but you could see their frustration-immediately asking if I was paying cash or card because the manager was sitting there counting the drawer and she didn't want to have to re-count. I paid card and got my smoothie and it almost just tasted like slightly flavored ice- I think my smoothie reaped the consequences of me getting there a few minutes before close. 

And this isn't even the worst part-I was standing next to the door where you pick up your smoothie and they had locked the door behind me, and a poor guy walked up and the door was locked, he looked at his watch as did I and it was still 5 minutes until 7-I just about unlocked the door for him but instead I questioned the girl: \"Don't you guy's close at 7?\" She chuckled and said \"Yeah\" as that poor guy was walking away. I was livid for him because it was so unprofessional and it happened to me the day before. I wish I knew the two girls names."}
{"text":"Service sucks. Always end up waiting 20-30 minutes just for a shake and sandwich. Better off going to a restaurant with those kind of wait times. Management needs to step it up. Only reason I come back is because Of the healthier alternatives. The surprise location is way better and quicker."}
{"text":"I keep coming back because the food and smoothies are so good!!!

This location is always tricky with parking because there's so many store fronts facing all of 15 parking spots. But once you're inside, like always, plan on waiting because the menu items are made-to-order. 

No drive thru here. No more punch cards. But LOTS of covered outdoor seating which is always nice!"}
{"text":"While the food and drinks are quite delicious here, it is the wait time that has deducted the fifth star. 

I love the hummus & veggie wrap and the Acai Berry Boost, but seriously, what takes soooo long?!?!"}
{"text":"Keep in mind there was only 1 person in front of me when I walked in and it still took 20 minutes for me to get my veggie hummus wrap. 

The two very bored looking employees had absolutely zero sense of urgency with their job. No smiles and no eye contact, both things are very important to me when I'm giving someone my business. It shouldn't matter how fancy or casual a place is. Employees should be lucky they have jobs. And business owners should be lucky they have customers. 

If you're looking for something \"fast\" but healthy, this establishment is only the latter. If you have some time, great, sit outside on their patio and enjoy yourself. I was just super annoyed by my experience because I was in a hurry and they were just moving like sad snails."}
{"text":"The inconsistency in the smoothies they make deserve zero stars alone.  Top that off with slow ass service and  hormonal teenage attitude then it's definitely a recipe for disaster.  I don't see why it's so hard for these kids to follow simple recipes, but apparently it's something they can't grapple. The owner needs to come to this store and check these fools.  I swear the location is it's saving grace, and the fact that it's 24hrs.  

I don't even know how there's 2.5 stars."}
{"text":"Evening of 7/28/2016
This place is a dirty disaster. 
First of all, the staff was blasting gangsta rap, it was so loud that I had to ask the guy at the counter to repeat himself several times while taking our order. They were out of watermelon and several ingredients for the hummus sandwich. Tables inside were not clean (and the loud music continued) so we had to sit outside in the summer heat. 

The Thai wrap I ordered not only came with wilted, overly marinated lettuce, and dry chicken, but I found a plastic clasp in my sandwich, you know the kind that comes on every loaf of grocery store bread that keeps the bag closed? Yeah, that happened. I took it back to the counter immediately and the staff only said \"oh, sorry about that\". I guess they're ok with making harmful mistakes in people's food. Biting into plastic and almost swallowing it, was not fun. 

All other food in our order was ok, absolutely nothing special. Mostly slapped together and not worth the $30 I spent at all. We didn't order smoothies, but we also will NOT be back to try them, either. Pretty bad on every level, especially the service and atmosphere. Yuck, yuck, yuck!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and have never really loved what I've gotten.  Their smoothies are alright (I prefer the ones from Thrive and Jamba Juice).  And their food is so so -- smallish portions but at least it leaves you feeling light and less stuffed.  

When I was still eating meat, I had ordered a chicken wrap once that I didn't finish because it was kinda yucky and on another visit, tried their fish tacos which were actually pretty tasty.  Have tried their cookies as well and wasn't impressed.

This time around, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that they now offer \"meatless chicken strips\" by Beyond Meat, which I asked them to sub for the roast beef in their Wasabi Caesar sandwich.  The meatless chicken, while super flavorful and tasty, was hard and rubbery in texture which was a definite minus but the rest of the sandwich was good.

Overall, not my favorite place but also not the worst."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of negative feedback from this smoothie bar regarding the employees who work there. So I took it upon myself to go to this smoothie bar every single day for one month straight. Let's just say that every single day there was something wrong with my order, I received the wrong order or I was charged the incorrect price. The last week was the worst. Not only did I order the same thing three days in a row but of those three days, I did not receive what I ordered, nor did I pay the same price each day EVEN THOUGH my receipt had what I had actually ordered. The second day in a row this happened, I asked the gal why I was charged less yesterday and more today? She said she did t know, they were training people, and continued to run my card for the more expensive cost and not provide any additional explanation. 
Being the vegetarian that I am, I was pleased to see so many options available with no meat or using a meat alternative in place of any meat in any item in the menu. Well, the first three times I ordered food, of which without any meat or meat alternative, they all came with meat. Of course I had already gotten home before opening my flat bread or looking at my salad but when I called and explained the situation, every time the person who answered the phone said that I could come back in and get a new order. Well, some of us do t have the time to go back and forth to get food that should have made correctly the first time. I asked for my money to be refunded back to my card. The gal on the phone said she didn't know how to do that. I asked to talk to the manager on duty, who wasn't available, and then I explained to her I could walk her through refunding my money back to my card, as it isn't rocket science and the machine pretty much walks you through each and every step. Well she didn't want to do this either and said she could only offer another wrap (or salad, the following day), but she was unable to offer any refunds due to store policy.
I had finally had enough. After a month of ordering the simplest of food and drink from incompetent individuals and asked for the contact information for the manager of this store. I was given this information and not only emailed her last week but have yet to hear back from her. But, I do get notified when someone reads an email I have sent to them and know that trooicalalana@gmail.com did intact read my email and just chose not to reply. I still love the smoothies and food too much to not go back but something needs to be done about the employees and their lack of knowledge."}
{"text":"10:40am. There is only one crew member. 3 customers including myself have been waiting for about 15min now. Another customer just walked in and has not been acknowledged nor greeted, at least a \"Welcome\" or acknowledgment that she will be attended shortly. Where's management in this place?"}
{"text":"The smoothies are great, the customer service sucks! I went in the drive -thru line at noon on a Sunday. I waited 10 minutes in the line of cars, which is a long time when u have only 2 cars ahead of you. When I got to the window I had to wait another 5 minutes until the young woman opened the window! She never said, \"sorry for the wait, or \"I'll be right with you, nothing. She only said, \"It'll be $7.50\" When she handed me my drink, no \"thank you\" no apologies, nothing!!"}
{"text":"idk how a large corp is ok with having 3 or less stars across the valley. who is running the show? every tropical smoothie i walk into is trashed. literally. this location i wasnt greeted or acknowledged. walked out after i saw an employee eating something from the line. ive been in food service, if the front of the house is garbage do u suppose whats coming from behind the scenes is any better? im sick of mass production serving third rate product at top dollar price"}
{"text":"Meet Kale:  Your new friend with benefits,   ;D

After a good work out, it's always nice to have a smoothie.  I'm not about that whole protein shake thing so give me that sweet unhealthy stuff.  I want sugar and loads of it.  Slap on a fun name like Peanut Butter Cup and I'm sold.  Peanut butter has protein, so I'm doing this work out thing right... right?

So this is a decently clean TSC. Service is ridiculously faster here than any other TSC I've been to. Drinks are still like $5.99 so if you want to make your smoothie at home, your buck will probably stretch more.  It's a super clean establishment considering some of the other TSCs I've been to looks like they never bus their tables or even pick up any stray napkins lying about.  I still haven't tried their food so I have no comments on that.  The staff here is actually friendly and informative!

All in all, this is a pretty good location.  It's in a quiet plaza next to the cheesesteak place so try to resist the smell of cheese and meats and enjoy a cold smoothie instead.  It's better for you, dang it!"}
{"text":"If tomatoes are classified as a fruit, isn't ketchup technically a smoothie?

Last night was the first time I stopped into this 19 yea-old smoothie chain and all I can say is... where ya been all my life!?  What a great company!  Tropical Smoothie Café (TSC) started National Flip Flop Day, a Tropical Smoothie Café holiday on the third Friday in June, to raise money towards Camp Sunshine.  They have raised 3.7 million dollars so far.  Wow!  I love it when people give back and I'll try my hardest to make it out to a TSC this June 17th for Flip Flop Day.

For my first TSC smoothie ever, I ordered the Avocolada Smoothie [avocado, pineapple, spinach, kale, coconut & lime], I also had some of my gal pal's Chia Banana Boost with Strawberries [coconut, almonds, dates, cinnamon, whole grain oats, chia seeds & roasted banana with strawberry], and some of my other girlfriend's Mango Magic [mango, pineapple & non-fat yogurt].  Sharing is caring, right?  I loved to Avocolada and the Chia Banana Boost with Strawberries the most!  Mango Magic is something that would surely be great for the mornings but after a lovely dinner with the besties, the Avocolada and Chia Banana Boost with Strawberries hit the spot.

This TSC is great --- 24hrs, bustling with lots of people, and the staff is really friendly.  I probably waited 5-10 minutes for my smoothie so we were in and out of there in the blink of an eye.  So yeah, hop onto their website and find the nearest TSC near you!  They're fresh, the quality is great, and don't forget to peruse the supplements and add-ins!  I haven't tried their food but I heard that they also make some good eats. 3.5 stars easily!"}
{"text":"My experience at this location is always pretty bad. The drive thru is so slow even if you're the only one in it. Half the time my smoothie tastes like it's very watered down. And I couldn't eat the sandwich I just got because the bread crumbled into ten pieces. They get one star for having a 24 hour drive thru, but this location really doesn't have anything else going for itself."}
{"text":"One of the best smoothies I have ever had. Hot the kiwi strawberry. Yummmmy!  I see other complaints it took to long. Did have to wait a bit for the person in front of me but as soon as pulled up mine was ready."}
{"text":"On March 25, 2018, around 2:30 p.m., my fiancé and I visited the said TSC branch. When we got there, there were no customers, but the drive thru lane seemed busy. There was only one staff member, Marcus, we saw working. He was courteous and took our order as soon as he was done with a drive thru order. Our order was taken at 2:37 p.m. A few minutes later, another female customer came in, waiting to order. After that, two staff members came in, a male named Verna and another African American female, wearing fuzzy slippers, which by the way, in my opinion, is an inappropriate footwear for work. It looked like they came from their break time, wearing the TSC visor and apron.The female customer that came in after us knew the female staff member that came in and greeted her and they knew each other. She took her order and made her smoothie right away. We were there before her. This staff member of yours even gave her the left-over smoothie with no charge. On top of that, it seemed that the order was not entered and seemed free. The staff took the cash and pretends to push the cash register. That's the first incident we noticed... We may be wrong but check your cameras. After waiting a while longer, this is already 2:55 p.m. - our smoothies weren't even attended to. There were 3-4 cars in the drive thru lane that drove by and left with their orders but not OURS. There are now THREE staff members, and no one attended to our order. I then came up to the counter and asked for our refund. I asked the female staff of why she did not took care of our order and she said that she was not even working. And yet she helped her friend and pocketed the cash payment. I was confused. There was confrontation and exchange of words. If she was not working, why was she there? Neither Marcus or Verna knew her name. Both stated they just started working. I  totally understand if they did not want to be involved but it does not help that neither do not know the name of their co-worker. She was very rude and had no remorse of her behavior. She does not represent TSC's customer service. I am sure you provide training to your staff to deliver excellent customer service.
I could not believe this happened but it did. I've attached a video clip of her screaming at us and flipping us off.
This is unacceptable behavior and I hope you do something about this employee.
What a horrible experience. We will not come back to this café EVER.
I want a REFUND. Please contact me as soon as possible.
Thank you for your time."}
{"text":"Place stinks like burnt rubber. Waited for a few minutes while the cashier, who was obviously late, put her purse away, said goodbye to her ride, and was trying to get her apron on and get clocked in. All while I just stood there and waited. There were two employees in the back just standing around and talking. Finally just walked out. There are other smoothie places, this place was a joke."}
{"text":"Three employees trying to figure out the register, to no avail. Several of us just standing there with no communication (a simple, \"be right with you\" would have gone a long way). I'm headed to Jamba Juice."}
{"text":"It's been 30 minutes and I'm still waiting for my smoothie. They're under staffed and that's not the staff's fault, that's lack of management. 
I had to ask for my smoothie because I only received the sandwich and they ran out of a product. 
This is the 2nd time this has happened. It's a busy location, I'm disappointed the owner doesn't seem to care about customer service because I love their smoothies but Won't come back here :("}
{"text":"Probably the slowest service in Vegas. I have tried to give them multiple chances. I am currently the only one in store and it's going on 5 minutes and they still have not taken my order. They keep saying they will be with me. It's incredible how slow they are. They need to hire more people or something. Go to the one right down the street on Tropicana. I am always in and out in less than 2-3 minutes"}
{"text":"This tropical smoothie sucks. We never get a greeting there's always some grumpy high school kid that hates being there and today I walked in there were two high school kids talking about their social life after 10 seconds of them continuing to talk and not caring that they had customers I blurted out \"hello\" . If you're going to hire teens teach them work ethic."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE: 

I usually go to Tropical Smoothie in Summerlin downtown and the costumer service and experience is nice. 
Unfortunately, tropical smoothie at 6350 W Charleston BLvd location has the worst costumer service ever. I had glitches placing order online. Some how for this specific location, app was telling to call them as at that moment this location wasn't able to process my order through their app. I called them and the girl was very rude. She told me that \"we don't take orders over the phone, you have to place the order through our app.\" I explained her at length that somehow your app is not accepting orders for this location today. That girl said that \"we have been receiving few orders through this app since morning, and as I said we don't take orders over the phone but I could make an exception for today.\" To that point after arguing with that girl and wasting my time over the phone early in the morning while I'm starting a brand new day, I told that girl that I place order through some other location. Because you don't know how to deal with a customer. And this is not the first time I had bad experience at that same location. I'm not going to that location in future. I hope their manager could work on the basics of customer dealing which is the most important part of the business!!"}
{"text":"Walked in, no greeting, to an impatient girl behind the counter. She informed us they were out of peanut butter and then stood at the far register and asked us to yell out our orders. After completing them, paying and reading them back to us she forgot two smoothies, a bowl and a sandwich. She was full of attitude and completely rude the entire time. Will not be returning. Thanks Maria G for an awful experience."}
{"text":"Very good, Convenient and affordable!  Plus I don't have to get out of my car because they have a drive thru check them out"}
{"text":"This is an awesome place!!! I love the healthnut smoothie. The wraps are too good. Thanks to living social coz that's how I found out this place. And this is one of my favs!!"}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN. This location is HORRIBLE. Went about 2 months ago&my wrap (which is what I order every time@a different location) was soggy and disgusting to the point I couldn't eat it. Took it back& they refunded me. Decided to give a try again today- even worse! \"Super green chicken Caesar\"- which is supposed to be.... you guessed it, super green! No kale, no romaine or other greens, just a few bits of wilted, soggy iceberg. Maybe 5 bits of thin chicken and a half handful of diced tomatoes. It was mostly just a tortilla. I attempted to eat part because i was STARVING and had waited forever for it...and have felt gross&sick since. Honestly horrible service&disgusting."}
{"text":"THE ABSOLUTE WORST! This location is honestly a joke. My gym is near this tropical smoothie and I always try to stop by here to grab something on the go, and every single time I come here there's ALWAYS something wrong. I came here late at night and during business hours and I waited at the drive-thru for 10 minutes. There was obviously someone inside but there was no answer, not even any acknowledgment that I was there. I even knocked on the window and the worker seemed like they were hiding. Another time I came during the day and the drive-thru lane was 4 cars deep so I decided to park and go inside. As I tried to walk in the front door was locked so I knocked on the glass for 5 minutes and the 2 workers inside were purposely ignoring me! My knocks grew louder and finally after nearly kicking down the door the workers point to the drive-thru and say that they're only taking order through there! WTF? WHO DOES THAT? It was practically lunch time and you're telling me the inside is closed? There's NO way. I decided to come another time because I was in a hurry again and as i pull up they tell me they're not serving any food. Are you kidding me?!? This location deserves to be shut down. THIS PLACE IS A JOKE."}
{"text":"Went there on 9/11/15 at about 1:50pm was in the drive thru for about 15 minutes and nobody even answered the window.  I looked in and kid was making smoothies and licking his fingers and putting the straws into the cups. And was grossed out and left. Never going back."}
{"text":"The food is actually really good!  Grabbed the chipotle chicken club, and it was awesome!  The sauce has a spicy kick to it and it's great. Always love their smoothies and they recommended the Sunrise Sunset.  Pineapple, strawberries, mango and orange.  So good!"}
{"text":"Waited about 10 minutes just to order a smoothie then another 10 to get it. There where two cars in front of me that I seriously don't know how long they had been waiting then 4 cars behind me. I get up the window and the guy is trying to be funny and to top it off he tells me there's no paper in the register so he couldn't give me a receipt. Seriously they need to open a new tropical smoothie on the side of town or get new management."}
{"text":"The smoothies are generally fine, but the staff is soooo slow.  Every time there are more than two people waiting they get completely overwhelmed.  They either need more help or better employees.  Maybe both."}
{"text":"Every time I come the staff is nice and friendly it's pretty clean. It does seem like they are also under staffed because they do get busy but I understand high labor. I did want to compliment the lady in the front that helped me on 3/10/17 at around 5:45 I didn't get her name but she was absolutely amazing. I've been having a really bad week but her kindness really helped. Keep her !"}
{"text":"Good smoothies, came in today and only 1 guy working 2 customers.  I'm not sure management has a game plan on keeping customers but when you walk in and that is the situation at least let the customer know you will be with them. Everybody gets busy,  make it a place people fell comfortable entering."}
{"text":"So usually come to this location for the 24hour drive thru late night. The late night staff is always good. Came in about a week ago in the late afternoon and had terrible customer service so felt the need to do an updated review. We ordered four smoothies to go. Noticed in the car that two of the smoothies looked great and the consistency they should have. The other two however were so thin that it was literally the consistency of water. Never have seen a smoothie look that thin especially when the other two I ordered looked how they were supposed to. Went back inside to ask them to remake  just those two. The guy behind the counter, Shawn had the worst attitude. I'm amazed this guy is employed in customer service because he is terrible at it. He was immediately confrontational when asked to remake them. Showed him what they looked like and his reply was \"yeah that's just how they come out sometimes nothing we can do\" um excuse me?!? Said again we wanted them remade he then says \" we don't remake anything unless it doesn't taste right\" really? I have worked in food service for many companies all of which would instruct its employees to remake an item if it's not right. My theory is that I'm pretty sure he was the one that mixed those two smoothies and for some reason took personal offense to being told they were not made properly. 

So after literally arguing about them making our order wrong he rolls his eyes then instructs the girl in the back to remake them then hides in the back right by where the smoothies are made. Hell no I'm not taking it at this point. Asked for a manager who of course was not there. Demanded refund. I'll give the other girl on duty credit kaylene or something like that. She came to the register apologized and offered to remake them. After being treated so poorly we just wanted a refund and to go to the other location down the road. She refunded us no questions asked and apologized again. This location should have more employees like her and get rid of the bad ones like Shawn who argues with customers when a smoothie is made wrong."}
{"text":"Two words.. HAPPY HOUR!! Between 4-7pm.. buy 2 smoothies and get one free..  ah, YES PLEASE!! we usually get the health nut with pea protein or peanut paradise.. the drive through lines are usually long - but the wait time is literally a few minutes..

Definitely a must if you're in the area.."}
{"text":"Every time i go they aren't serving food and it takes 20 minutes to get my smoothie in the drive through when there isn't even a line"}
{"text":"After 2 1/2 hours of Bootcamp I went and got a detox island green.  I was excited because I thought the junks that were in my smoothie were junks of mango but soon realized the junks were plastic.  I called immediately because I was to tired to go back to have no one answer the phone.  I filled out the experience on there website to have no one respond back.  I took pictures and a video of my smoothie.  I know stuff happens, but to not even get a sorry that happened.  I will take my money and business elsewhere!!"}
{"text":"Loving the fake chicken option ! Though this specific location is less than quality. Theres a rotten sewer smell every time i come in,  no paper towles in the restroom , no soap , the employees are far from friendly they usually just look at me blankly without saying anything and apparently are offended by 5$ tips, and there seems to be a resident homeless man that kind of lives there . One night i came in alone and honestly was TERRIFIED. Id seen the homeless man earlier that day ( im tellin you, the meatless chicken is amazing) and he was outside begging for cigarettes,  when he asked my boyfriend for a cigarette he handed him one and smiled while the man said nothing.  We then sat down outside to eat, only to realize he was staring at my guy,  eyes narrow and not blinking.  I forgot about him and finished my meal.  That night i came in around 3am and he was inside , i didn't think anything of it and sat down to wait for my food only to realize he was staying at me. 1 table away.  Not blinking.  For a solid 7 minutes or so.  I was honestly so afraid , my back started cramping. The man working that night was unfriendly enough to make me wonder briefly if  he would help the homeless man murder me.  
Very uncomfortable.  
And that smell!  Gross.  
Tropical smoothie, yay.
This location? Nay."}
{"text":"Will never go here again. Probably never go to another tropical smoothie at all in fact. I had ordered a chocolate, banana, peanut butter smoothie...please note: No seeds in any of these ingredients. 
I was drinking and kept swallowing something I thought was seeds, until I remembered there has never been and would never be seeds in this smoothie. 
I spit it out into my hand and there were little pieces of plastic in my mouth. I then poured the smoothie out to find MORE all throughout the smoothie and sitting at the bottom of the cup. 
Never again. Never. Again."}
{"text":"This one was a fluke, i didn't have time to stop by my original location and this was on the way. 

This place wasn't that busy, but they only had one employee working. He was taking orders, making them and just trying to maintain this location. so all these bad reviews should probably be directed to management. The poor kid was doing his best! I've worked in food before and it's not easy, it isn't his fault they were understaffed.

The place was a bit dirty and the bathrooms were a mess, but again I believe it's because he was alone, I don't think he gets the chance to clean if he's busy taking and making the orders.. 

And for the smoothie, well that wasn't that great either, It was a bit watery but not bad. I wanted to order food as well but he looked so overwhelmed, I decided not to."}
{"text":"Worst location ever!! Slow service, smoothies don't taste like they should, the wraps and flatbreads are made with very minimal ingredients (chicken, tomatoes, etc.), and the employees have zero customer service skills. Granted this is a \"fast food\" business, but gas station employees have better customer service skills and and a better understanding for how to greet and attend to guests/customers. The employees will let you sit in a queue for over 10-15 minutes at the window, without acknowledging you or at least taking your payment to verify your order (which more than likely they've gotten it incorrect). I don't know why I keep coming back to this location, it always takes over 20 minutes for my order, even with only one car in front of me at the drive through. - Rant and review over, off I go to sucking down ice chunks in my smoothie- thanks for nothing Tropical Smoothie this is the last time you charge me for ice and make me wait for 20 plus minutes!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Tropical Smoothie since Florida days. I'm so glad I found this spot that's so close by. The smoothie that has kale (not sure which One it was) tasted amazing and I wouldn't know it had it in it if the gal at the register didn't tell me. 

The flatbread sandwich was amazing, did I say how AMAZING it was, and the pairing that the gal picked for me was awesome. 

Another thing I like is when I can go into a food location and the person taking the request can suggest something. Many places you go to they stare at you like a deer in headlights. If you work there, unless you have a food allergy, the company should make you taste it free of charge so you can acquit yourself with the products you are to sell! This gal admitted she hadn't tried them all, but again, I was impressed with the pairing."}
{"text":"Every other word spoken by the staff was \"What the fu*k\". There were at least 6 customers were at tables and we all heard what was being said. This is unprofessional."}
{"text":"Strongly dislike this location, which is unfortunate because it is the closest one to me. Never had a good experience with the customer service of any employee working. Rude and careless staff, along with slow service and long waits every time. Smoothies are a hit and miss also."}
{"text":"Have been a customer of Tropical smoothie for years and have never come across a rude cashier that didnt allow me to add my own protein powder to my smoothie, explained my diet requirements and I couldnt take other brand than the one I use. 

Shame on this location for being so squared.

update: SMOOTHIE KING added my protein no issues, glad to have taken my $$$ somewhere else, better options at Smoothie King anyways."}
{"text":"If you want to have to argue with the chick behind the counter for your change go here! First if I could give it a zero I would. I get to the door and it's locked at 8:30am when they clearly say open at 5am she runs to get me as I'm walking back to my car and says sorry I was trying to fix the over... ok... anyways leaves me waiting another 5-7 minutes to take my order. I'm the only one in there. She takes my order and cash then leaves the register open and goes to the back. I guess to keep messing with the oven. She comes back hands me my drink and receipt and never my change. I tell her can I have my change she said I already gave it to you. I said no sorry but you didn't you just handed me my receipt. She argued backs and forth...I walked out told her to keep the change to fix her broken oven. Never again I'll drive a little further for better service and less attitude."}
{"text":"So I am addicted to Tropical Smoothie.... No, really I am.  I think they are putting some addictive agent in the drinks.  They are that good!!  I give them top marks for their drinks.  The Peanut Paradise with Whey is my fav.  The Basil/Lemon/Mint/Orange is new and killer!

I have been to 4 LV locations so feel pretty confident when I give this feedback.  In addition, I frequent their establishments at least 2-3 times a week.  I said I was addicted!!!  :p

The wait is usually 5-10 minutes.  Longer if there are more than 2 people in line.  So be prepared.  This really isn't a fast food establishment.  Quick isn't their motto.  I have stopped going to their location off Flamingo because the wait was just ridiculous each time.

Their food is ok.  I have tried their Thai chicken salad, chicken wrap, and chicken salad on walnut bread.  The food is fresh.  But it is expensive for the amount you get.  The last 2 times I got sandwiches the filling part of the sandwich was so small, it was all bread.  

Bonus info...they have a stamp card and infrequently give out coupons.  They are worth it though!  A penny saved is a penny earned!!  :)"}
{"text":"Good food. Takes way too long for food and drinks to be made. Was 15 min this time for a simple sandwich and smoothie."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot when I don't feel like getting out of the car. I usually go here when it's late night and I just want to get something to eat. Sometimes I find myself not even buying a smoothie and that may seem unorthodox, but that's my story. I only gave it four stars because the food not really that great.

Nevertheless, tropical smoothie is a great place to get food later at night when there's no other option. It's open 24 hours so unless miraculously you have more than 24 hours in your day, tropical smoothie is THE place to go when it's right down the street from your house.

I'll give them credit though. Their cranberry \"whatever it's called\" sandwich is usually what I get when I'm not really sure what I want to grub on, but it's the best thing since sliced bread. Although, the order itself involves sliced bread so I'm not really sure how that works.

okay, I'll give them credit. Get the mango magic if you're in the mood for a smoothie.

The end."}
{"text":"Great place to get a quick, healthy, and affordable meal on the Strip. You can add a smoothie to any meal for $3.50. I had the jerk chicken wrap and an acai smoothie, both very tasty. The whole order cost me about $12, which is an absolute bargain in the Strip. Much healthier option than the rest of the restaurants in that food court."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to take my daughter after church and found this place on yelp. It was very nice. The smoothies were excellent and the food was excellent as well. I a chicken caesar wrap that was really good. My daughter had a caesar salad. Its a great place for a quick meal if you want the smoothies as well."}
{"text":"I go here all the time after my workout for the good smoothies. But I today was the first and last time I get a wrap here. I love my greens and was definitely disappointed when I took a bite just to find, not one, but EVERY piece of lettuce was very old, yellow and brown. If this is how the lettuce is I can only imagine the fruit in the smoothies that you can't see?"}
{"text":"I LOVE Tropical Smoothie, this location is TERRIBLE! The staff is super rude, and hostile. Another customer came in after me and wasn't greeted and ignored. The girl answered her cell phone and was talking while washing dishes. I watched her spray water from the sink into a blender multiple times. The girl working the DT is wearing food handling gloves- made food, did cash handling and then went back to make another sandwich! Go to another location!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! I came in with my coupon I got from my email for a free bday smoothie. I had cut the coupon out and he had the nerve to keep arguing with me saying it was a copy. It was not a copy the printer I had used was running out of ink so it looked slightly distorted but you could still read all the information. I even opted to show him my email and told him if it really was a problem I would show up with a new printed one if it was that much of an issue and that I would email corporate sometime to just to prove my point that it is still valid. I don't know if this older ignorant man was the owner or manager but wow what a jerk off. I normal am not a confrontational person but this guys ignorance was just irritating and I hate when people assume things when they have no idea what they are talking about. In the end I got my free birthday smoothie...luckily the younger girl who works there was a lot more polite and I tipped her since she was the one who made the smoothie for me an apologized for her ignoranant manager she even had tried explaining to him that this was still good it just looked like that because it started to get low on ink."}
{"text":"Something about the customer service here was just not so pleasing, they seemed unhappy to take my order. Also I made the mistake of ordering a noodle bowl at a smoothie shop. Tropical smoothie is a place for smoothies, not food. I like their turkey-cranberry sandwich, but that's all it is, a sandwich. Way too pricey for what it is. But the smoothies? Top notch. Better than Jamba Juice, but I suspect that's just because of more added sugar."}
{"text":"This Tropical Smoothie has THE WORST service compared to other locations in the Vegas. Service is usually slow, smoothies are sometimes a miss in consistency like chunks of frozen fruit or kale."}
{"text":"Although I was sick with a sinus infection... and what I mostly tasted was \"cold\" ... 

From my previous visits to Tropical Smoothie, its sweet and delicious and oh-so refreshing on a \"normal\" Vegas day. 

Will definitely come back since this place is more abundant than Jamba Juice or any other places of the sort around my neighborhood"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend The Health Nut smoothie. You can never complain about a healthy smoothie that tastes like it should be unhealthy. For $5 and some change, the smoothie was about double the size I expected and I was full before I finished it. Also, the lady working was very willing to make recommendations as all smoothies start blending together (pun intended) once you read the entire board. Final piece of advice, make sure you have dental floss handy unless you want to keep the kale and spinach in your teeth as a trophy of your healthy meal."}
{"text":"Amazing! Love the prices and the flavors! They use real sugar cane. Clean and attractive place to enjoy with friends."}
{"text":"Great variety of smoothies with coffee, chocolate and peanut butter options too. They usually have some new limited flavor, which i'm lucky to get a special deal ($2) for often. Just join their loyalty club to enjoy a periodic $2 smoothie or $2.99 new food item deal. The store is near a Starbucks, so expect parking to be sparse. There can be a wait, but I've always enjoyed my smoothies here!"}
{"text":"I used a text promo for the Mediterranean flatbreads for $2.99. The steak flatbread was very tasty!
The toasted flatbread had steak, lettuce, tomatoes, red onion & best of all, plenty of Mediterranean sauce/dressing! For me, it's all about that sauce. It was a creamy dressing that went great with the flatbread. There are also salads, more flatbread varieties and many smoothie flavors to choose from. 
You can add a smoothie to any meal for $4. This is a good place to fuel up before hitting those blackjack tables!"}
{"text":"I usually have a coupon or text promo when I come here. Nothing like a 99 cent or $2 smoothie to cheer me up! This location inside the food court is not very busy, and I've found the employees to be nice. If there is not a wait, you can have your smoothie in a matter of minutes. The new flavors are usually very good, and, and I also enjoy the chocolate/peanut butter variety. I think they are open until 10 pm."}
{"text":"The drive through wait time is absolutely ridiculous. Been waiting for 25 minutes. No one has even taken my order. I backed out and went to the pizza place next door lol"}
{"text":"Horrible place, if this place knows that is in a prime location you would think they would hire more staff. There's a regional manager making smoothies while there's 1 worker in the kitchen making sandwiches. Come on workers get with it.  I'm utterly disappointed in the staff, poor communication, poor service.  This place is Heathy but HORRIBLE in service and staffing, the cleanliness is at it's worse. Recheck the grade.  This place is not an A rating. This place should be shut down. Unprofessional and I'm disgusted. .."}
{"text":"Great smoothies. Not so great food. I highly recommend the smoothies though. And the service was quick."}
{"text":"Mostly helpful and courteous staff... until today, but that's not my rational for the point deduction.  I stop by almost everyday to get a Diet Coke and a large cup of ice- great nugget ice. I am always charged 27 cents for the cup of ice... okay. I believe since the drinks are in bottles that a cup with ice should be included, especially since their soft drinks are quite high at almost $3 each for 16.9 oz. Today I ordered 3 drinks with a cup of ice for each- only the drinks were very warm (\"We just put them out\") and I was still charged for each the cups with ice...  even when I pointed out how warm the bottles are...not cool. C'mon TSC, you can do better than that!"}
{"text":"I had not frequented Tropical Smoothie Café in quite some time due to a bad experience previously, but when some co-workers suggested it for lunch I decided to go along.

For lunch I had the Thai chicken wrap with some sun chips...

I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised! The wrap was very yummy!  I really enjoyed the combination of flavors and textures, the Thai peanut dressing is great!"}
{"text":"Every time I come to this location, they are always out of the Veggie Chicken option and it's understandable that the business runs out of stock on items. When I try to call in to make sure they have the item in stock before driving out to the location, the phone just rings and rings and rings. And after calling multiple times just to see if they answer, they do not. I'm really starting to despise this location and it sucks because it's so close to my home."}
{"text":"This tropical smoothie is the only convenient location near my house. Service isn't as bad as the other one by my work. I like how they send text messages for deals. I also like how their smoothies are thick. I just don't like how they took away the punch card system. That used to be the only reason why I loved always going back and buying a bunch of smoothies even for other people.  Now, I only go if my boyfriend is craving it."}
{"text":"As much as I love Tropical Smoothie, this place sucks because of their workers. There have been multiple times where I've been not helped, been rude to, or got my order completely wrong. And what's crazy is, the other reviews about who could be their manager (older white dude) are true! He's super rude and for no reason!!! Doesn't know customer service at all and doesn't need to be like that. He makes me feel uncomfortable and also said rude things to my friends. If there was a number I could call, I would so report this store. Also, girls from before were so rude and definitely don't know how to treat someone. Their smoothies here are also inconsistent. Bad service. Bad quality. You're making your business look bad."}
{"text":"Smoothie machine is constantly broken. Hours online are listed as 24hrs. Called corporate a couple weeks ago and was assured that these issues would be addressed. The website still shows 24 hrs and the store is closed.  Too bad because when one of the two people working actually gets your order right it a good place. Jamba Juice doesn't open until 6:30am so it's a lose lose for those who work early. The other store is open from 700:00-900:00. That's good to know."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly enough (1star) smoothies were ok (1star). Forgot our smoothies literally 20 min later... As one guy goes on break busy flirting with the girlfriend that came in the other tells another customer they are slow. I stand there and he goes \"are you waiting for something?\" .... I reply \"yes our smoothies\" I had to tell him what I ordered and wait all over again."}
{"text":"the chicken chipotle club keeps me
comimg back here.! it's amazing.. this location is pretty convenient although i was turned off by the handwritten sign on the drive thru speaker about not accepting rewards app (tacky).. the customer service here isn't consistent.. but again the food is great and so is the location."}
{"text":"Very slow service. Staff was nice but very slow. For a rush hour more than 1 person should be helping. Cashier couldn't take veryones orders because she had to help with the smoothies. There was over 9 people in line and just waiting. People walked out. Spent entire lunch here 30 min still didnt get food or smoothie. Need more staff"}
{"text":"Pretty impressed. It was a 40 minute walk from my hotel and I was quite glad I did it. I got the pesto chicken flatbread sandwich and a 'kiwi quencher' (strawberry kiwi with yogurt) smoothie. 

I was mega impressed with the sandwich. It was so good how hot it came out and the pesto quality was quite up there. They didn't skimp out on adding the pesto either and the cheese and chicken were both nice. Reasonable value for it at $5.99 too. 

I got the smoothie added which made my bill ~$11.50 (tax included). The smoothie was huge! (Though I'm told portions are usually bigger in the US?) I missed seeing I could add health boosters for 99cents a pop and might have done that. The smoothie was on the sweet side but not too sweet. It was also nice that the kiwi and strawberry flavours were well balanced."}
{"text":"I am currently in the store and when I walked in I wasn't even greeted . Adia if I'm spelling her name right was very rude. Instead of her saying hi may I take your order or something of the sorts she just stated tapping her long fake nails on the register as if I was taking too long for her. This is a very bad representation of Tropical smoothie and I will never return again to this location ."}
{"text":"My husband brought me here shortly after I got back in town from Atlanta. After about 5 minutes of the \"I don't know, what do you want to eat?\" game, we settled on Tropical Smoothie. Personally, I didn't even know they sold food, so I was speechless when we pulled up through the drive thru. It was late at night so I got a variation of my husband's order: Mango Magic and a Chicken Chipotle type wrap,  save for tomato. The workers were extremely pleasant and upbeat (they were listening to loud music, so yay for morale booster!) Having worked at another Smoothie joint, I expected this to be one in the same but it had a bit of a strange...aftertaste? Probably because we dumped tubs of sugar in our smoothies at the old place, but after 20 minutes it became an acquired taste. Hubby had to remind me it was also because this place was completely healthy whereas where I worked they were \"kinda healthy.\" The Wrap was phenomenal and I'm kicking myself for not asking for a second wrap. I will definitely be back to try new flavors of smoothies and the food selections!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service.  I was the ONLY customer in the store and still had to wait over 15 minutes for my smoothie while the employees socialized.  Then I was given the excuse that \"the smoothie had to be remade\" which was a blatant lie.  Avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"A smoothie shop with a 24 hour drive-thru?!?! Say whaaaaat? That is so awesome!! Okay, so maybe I'm just a little too excited about this place. But keep in mind that for the past 4 years, I lived in Irvine, CA where the only 24 hour things we had was a 7-Eleven, Denny's, one donut shop, and one CVS store. 

One day I was craving a smoothie and immediately thought, I'll go to a Jamba Juice! Then I learned that they did not have any locations near where I lived. But that's okay because I discovered Tropical Smoothie Café, which is better in my opinion!

This past week, I came here two days in a row because I liked it so much! When I first walked in, I was surprised to see a full menu of smoothies and food, for some reason I thought they just had drinks. Good to know that I can also grab food for breakfast or lunch here! So far I have tried the Acai Berry Boost and the Paradise Point Smoothies. Both were very good and made perfectly (not watery)! I also have my eye on other flavors that I want to try next. On my second visit I ordered the Paradise Combo, which is any smoothie + a wrap, sandwich or a salad (you pick one) + chips or fruit. It was $9.99, but for all that I think it was worth the price. I tried the Sesame Chicken Salad, which was pretty good. They even gave me extra dressing, even though I didn't ask for any. 

Customer service is great as well, friendly employees and no mistakes on my orders so far. Don't forget to join Club Tropical on their website. You get a free smoothie on your birthday! This is my new favorite smoothie place!"}
{"text":"Wanted to order a smoothie and half a sandwich, but was told they can't make the half sandwich and that I had to order the whole sandwich. How does that make sense? Pretty annoying"}
{"text":"This place has disappointed me. My fiance and I go here weekly. Two to three time a week. We are very patient people and they have pushed us to our limit. The service is very slow. Usually our smoothies are good but lately it has been disgusting. The prices went up but the quality has gone down a lot! We gave this place so many chances but we no longer going there! You're not only loosing two customers. I'll be telling my friends and family not to waste their time or money at Tropical Smoothie!"}
{"text":"i love this place, the girls always remember my smoothie and are always pleasant they ran out of splenda today and i left and walked next door and bought them a big ass thing of splenda so they wouldn't run into that problem for the day, they were so kind and grateful, my fav place :)"}
{"text":"The reviewers on here aren't lying when they said the service is slow. We waited half an hour for just two drinks and two sandwiches. I give an extra star because I ordered a smoothie with a half sandwich, but he went ahead and gave me the full one. Hey, he could've just taken it for his lunch lol. Anyway, no sense of urgency from those workers."}
{"text":"I really like tropical smoothie! My usual is a chia max ***** and  the cali chicken club **(chicken was a little tough in the middle this time). I hate how hidden this location is, compared to the old location and they need an actual drive-through window. But it's 24 hr"}
{"text":"Six months ago I swore I would never come back to this place.  The service is just terrible.  I arrived around 7:40AM on my way to work to find the lobby filled with people waiting to order, and just as many waiting for their smoothies.  There were at least three workers on shift but only one was up front-- both taking orders and making smoothies.  Again, only one was helping the whole room full of people.  I waited good 15 minutes for my time to order only to be told then, that she was too busy to take my order.  At this point I advised the young lady that I knew it wasn't her fault, but that all of us waiting were on our way to work, and this kind of wait was unacceptable.  I told her that her that they needed to get everyone up front and helping the customers, or if that was not possible, that her boss quite simply needed to hire more people.  To my surprise, she actually started to push back, but by then I'd had it and turned around and left.

Cut to Wednesday of this week.  I finally forgave and since they're on my way to work, decided to give them a chance once again.  I stop by and much to my surprise, the very same girl was the only one working! Fortunately, I was the only customer in the building, so she was able to help me without too much delay, although her demeanor is about as warm as an Alaskan winter.

So I go back again this morning and it is literally the same scene I walked out of six months ago.  The same girl is the only one working, the room was full of pissed off people waiting, the girl doesn't care and won't bring anyone up to help.  No manager or owner in site.

I didn't say anything this time as, burn me once.... you know the analogy...

It is a pity that the Tropical Smoothie brand allows it's name to be represented in this way.  They have a good product I would like to continue to use, but I will NEVER enter this location again.  

This is the worst run establishment in my zip code hands down."}
{"text":"Every time I come here there is only one person working and I always have to wait for 20 min.  In addition, they are always out of what I order.   Today is my last trip after 10 attempts.   Ill go somewhere else from now on.  If I could give negative stars I would."}
{"text":"When you think of franchise restaurants your generally think of places like subway and I wasn't going to try this but heard great review on smoothies. 

The Order : Thai style salad, not pictured Buffalo chicken wrap and banana mango smoothie and also a strawberry / blue berry mix. 

The Buffalo Chicken Wrap was amazing one of the best I have had toasted and also chicken was nicely coated with hot sauce. 

The Thai Style Salad. -- well I liked the dressing however the chicken was warm also subway like processed chicken kinda hard to eat and had to push aside and eat the greens. 

The smoothies -- Really had a craving today the banana was really great almost at points tasted like pineapple the blue berry one is too. 

So if your tired of eating mass amounts of pizza, or deep fried food check this place out. I normally don't do franchises however was relatively surprised with this one. 

They offer delivery service threw grub hub however from what I heard its only credit card option only no cash. and offer military discount."}
{"text":"Maaan my first bad Yelp. This place is a customer service disaster... no hi. No how are ya. No kiss my ass nothing, stonewalled at the register. Tweaker bitch in the back busy doing laps. Peanut Paradise looks like shit ditto on the cookies. I just wanted a cookie :/ 2 stars cause the joint is clean and with everyone hopped up on whatever they where quick. Needs improvement to say the least."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! You must try the tacos! The thai chili steak and the smoked jalapeño chicken. The chocolate chiller is amazing!"}
{"text":"Hate to rate with a three star, but I love the food and all the smoothies! However if you love waiting to be greeted, this is the place for you. I've had this happen more than once to where I've stood there looking at the employees, and them knowing I'm there. However I love nothing more than waiting for someone to take my order when I'm next in line. Needless to say I was finally helped after about ten or so minutes, by someone asking me if I had ordered yet. The staff needs some work, maybe retrained idk. But something has to give with the customer service."}
{"text":"This location has absolutely no sense of how to run a business. I came in today, to buy gift cards and 6 smoothies. My total was $98, I go pay with $100 bill and the woman told me she cannot except it. She then called her manager right in front of me to ask if she could, and I guess the manager said no.  Since that was my only form of payment I had,  they are out a sale. I will not be returning, too bad for this location! I used to go here at least three times a week."}
{"text":"How can you run out of coffee??? Pennies to make and you store it in a fridge. And please clean  the drive thru window and shelf. A food place should never have a dirty image."}
{"text":"Pretty good location. They tend to get pretty busy at lunch time, when I usually frequent this place, but they are efficient and always seem to get each customer in and out as quickly as possible. Customer service is pretty friendly as well."}
{"text":"They have a drive thru. Already I'm sold. They have been friendly and efficient from the few times I have been and did I mention they have a drive thru?"}
{"text":"This is a decent Tropical Smoothie. I prefer the ones with a drive thru for convenience, but this is a large location with plenty of seating and tables to lounge while you enjoy a quick bite or a smoothie. 

It's located near the freeway on ramp to the 215, so I end up here when I'm in the area and need a quick pick me up."}
{"text":"I have nothing but great things to say about this place. The people are amazing it just makes it a pleasure to be here in Vegas. The staff are to get a raise. This place really makes Vegas shine."}
{"text":"We ordered two smoothie through the drive thru. The smoothies are better than the store at 215 and Cheyenne. It did take awhile to get our smoothies."}
{"text":"Terrible smoothies. We got a mango magic and jetty punch and they are the worst tasting smoothies ever. The mango magic was a sour taste. You couldn't tell there was mango or pineapple in it. The jetty punch also tasted horrible. We will not be coming back. Waste of money!"}
{"text":"ZERO STARS - This location is the absolute WORST! I waited in line for the drive-through for 15 minutes to get to put in my order and after waiting another 5 for the attendant to be ready, I ordered, then they told me they didn't have food. The ONLY reason I came. I ordered a smoothie by default and waited another 20 minutes to get to the window and be greeted to pay. This is UNACCEPTABLE. No food and I've been waiting for over 45 MINUTES! IT'S A SMOOTHIE. I knocked on the window and a girl came out saying she is THE ONLY employee there. Seriously??? I eventually asked for a refund and after first refusing... they finally returned my money but never brought the smoothie! Finally, after waiting she asked why I was still there, um.. to get the smoothie I've been waiting for over 45 minutes for!!!! 

She was a nice girl but the MANAGEMENT of this location is UNACCEPTABLE! You need to make a change, now."}
{"text":"Every time I come here, their service is super slow. I went in the drive thru I had three toddlers in the back seat and asked if they could split a smoothie three ways...they told me no they can only do it two ways. Uhm? Okay is one more way that difficult? 
There's also no \"hi how are you?\", when you approach the window you're just told the total. 
Doesn't seem like they really want work there or like they even want to make money. Don't come here if you're in a hurry. Sometimes the wait is like 20 minutes long just for one drink.

At least my smoothie was delicious."}
{"text":"Never open on time. Have came to this location numerous times to find business still closed at 6am. Or once i was told to come back in 15 minutes when the next shift would arrive.  I live less than 5 minutes away from this location and would rather drive 15 minutes to Jones and 215 location."}
{"text":"Caution - the wraps at this location DO NOT look like what is advertised in pictures.

I have been a number of Tropical Smoothies and this location by far had the least impressive presentation and quality of food.  I ordered a wrap as I usually do.  The wrap looked like a $2 Taco Bell burrito.  As a matter of fact, a Taco Bell burrito for $2 is a better value than the $7 wrap I ordered from this Tropical Smoothie location.  I expect to receive a wrap that looks good, tastes good and is filling.  When I mentioned to the young lady behind the counter that the wrap does not look like the picture, she replied with, \"Things never look like the picture.\"  I was completely surprised by her answer.  That statement is not accurate.  The other two Tropical Smoothies that I visit do a very fine job of filling the wrap with the ingredients and presenting it nicely.  She said that all items are measured.  She did offer to remake the wrap (that looked more like a burrito).  I asked her if she was happy with the quality of her \"work\" and if she believed she had presented me with the best wrap she could make.  She said she had.  Additionally she said she was just doing her job and that the wrap was made the way it was supposed to be made.  With that, I chose not to have the wrap remade.  

The location was clean with a nice layout.  It had the Tropical Smoothie branding.  The shake we ordered was good.  The wrap was below average and so was the response from the clerk when our concerns were brought to her attention."}
{"text":"Bottom line - if you would like to receive your food in less than 10 minutes after ordering, it's best you NOT eat at this location.  

The quality of food at this Tropical Smoothie is above average - it's good.  The presentation is nicely done. The food tastes good.  The owner - and wrap/sandwich maker - takes pride in putting the wraps and sandwiches together.  I will give him that.  I don't want to say that he is SLOW, but it is obvious that it's busy enough that there needs to be 2 to 3 additional food preparers.  I understand that the owner saves in operational costs by not hiring additional help, but the service suffers because of it.  After being disappointed on several occasions, I am finally deciding that I will not spend my time or money at this location.  I am bothered that he finds it acceptable to see customers wait 15 to 25 minutes.  At those waiting times, I might as well go to sit-down restaurant.

Note:  The smoothies are prepared a bit faster.  There are typically 3 smoothie makers on staff."}
{"text":"I visited the 9800 block west sahara location in Las Vegas and received the absolute worst counter service I have ever received from a girl named Ashley. She was in the process of counting the money in the register at 150 pm when there were 2 customers waiting to order. First she counted the bills and then to the coins. When she got to the pennies and 10 minutes of waiting in I asked if I could order and she said no. I then put in my order direct to the guy behind the blender counter. By the time my drink was ready she was still counting change. When she finished, she went to the back and then left. Still haven't paid. Then guy who made smoothie goes to the register and starts to count the money again. I thought I was on the twilight zone. Finally after almost 15 minutes I got to pay. I love TSC but this experience was absurd."}
{"text":"Been here 6 or 7 times since it's 2 blocks away (almost always tip), and yet to receive high level customer service. I usually always go to the flamingo and decatur location and the service there is on point. Time to step up the service a lil or I'll go back to the other location."}
{"text":"The customer service at this store is terrible. They are incredibly slow, understaffed,and it seems like they don't have proper training on dealing with rush hour. 
I went in at 12, ordered a wrap and a smoothie. It took them almost 1 hour to complete my order. I got the smoothie with in 10 minuets, and then waiting for about 45 minutes for the wrap. Being on my HR long lunch break, this pit me in a crunch to get back to work on time. 
The girl making the smoothies had a poor attitude and seemed annoyed with the customers that continued to come in. 
The gentleman that came to take my order ( only after the front girl snapped at him that there was a line) was abrasive and I could tell he was rushing through. 
Finally an other young woman came to give my my food order once it was done, and she was the first smile that I saw with in the store. She was cheerful and did apologize for having there be such a long wait. 
My suggestion would be to move the young girl that was making the food today to the front as cashier. She was the only one with in the store that was personable. I wish I would have gotten her name."}
{"text":"Came in to cool down on a hot day and grab some smoothies. Very good but very sweet. Might ask for less sugar next time."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and their smoothies are delicious, reasonably priced and of great size! The food is subpar, either too much dressing, too dry, or not fresh enough. I love that they have a drive through. However I have two suggestions for them: 1. Give customers their receipts! Both times I've been there they've failed to do so and it would be nice to know what I'm being charged for. 2. Have a beaming *DRIVE THRU OPEN* sign because had I not called ahead of time to check on their hours I would have drove off (if you come after the lobby is closed, the front of the business looks pitch black and its easy to think the drive thru is not open)."}
{"text":"Seriously the worst location. Went through the drive through sat for 10 minutes nobody came so went inside the lady at checkout was so rude I asked for a coke with my sandwich and she said they don't sell any soda but it says beverages for $2.50 on the menu so I was like whatever not a big deal. the guy in the back was on a phone call the whole time. just ridiculous will never come back again. I've been here for 10 minutes the girl asks the guy in the back if my sandwich is ready and he said uh no there's no turkey and nobody has came to tell me anything. are you kidding me?!?"}
{"text":"Makes me wonder if there is something in the smoothies that has made the staff unfriendly. This was the second time I've been to this location and the first round of bad service wasn't a fluke.  It's a 24 Hour Drive Thru which rocks but I think I'll opt for the 24 Hour on Warm Springs and Durango from now on.  The food was still good, Hummus and Veggie was good stuff and the Blimey Limey was ironically sublime.  So my main downgrade is that the food lives up to the corporate stamp but the service is meh.  I waited at the drive thru call up for quite some time before someone felt honored enough to grace me with an inquiry for my order. Then when I got to the window, she opened it up, looked at her screen and said \"Oh Crap\" and then shut the window on me.  What happened after that was a case study for bad customer service.  The three staff members huddled around and talked and then when about eight minutes later she opened the window again, she said nothing and so I asked, \"Is there a problem with my order?\" and she says \"No\" and then she goes to the register to let me know what my total was and I hand her my credit card.  She runs the card but noticing that the window is open,decides to close it again in case I was getting any feeling of warmth.  She hands me the receipt to sign without saying a word and continues a conversation with her fellow staff.  She then hands me the drink and I put it in my cup holder and then with what might have been the most dismissive stance I've received, she continues to talk and hands the bag out the window not even looking at me. As I was a bother. I took the bag. Not a thank you uttered.  If I didn't know better I think I might have just been part of an elaborate comedic ruse where the girl was actually Bon Qui Qui. Which is good that I left immediately and didn't \"get crazy\" for fear she might \"cuut\" me."}
{"text":"I like this particular Tropical Smoothie location.  The folks are friendlier and the smoothies just seem to taste better.  It doesn't have a drive thru but the one down the street has a drive thru and I get a side of attitude I didn't even order.  So with that said, i'm taking my business to this location.  It feeds the same corporate giant but at least I will feel more at ease. Seriously, you shouldn't feel stressed at a smoothie joint."}
{"text":"-2 stars until I'm able to actually order online ahead at this location ( Cheyenne and buffalo). I come here for lunch which is only 30 minutes,  I don't want to spend 15 of it waiting for my food. 

Customer service is great, 15 minutes to get food fresh made and we'll as a made to order smoothie is not bad on time. The girls who work there are always friendly."}
{"text":"I arrived and noticed that there were only 2 people working, one in the kitchen and one in the front.  I ordered a breakfast wrap and a smoothie.  The front counter girl was pretty busy, taking orders and making smoothies.  I overheard her that she got a phone order for 10 smoothies, so I could understand that she was busy.  I got my smoothie before my food, which I thought was a little odd.  I got my food, an all american wrap, and headed to work.  When I got to work, the wrap was cold.  The shredded cheese that was used was not melted, and when I bit in to the wrap, the egg was cold.  Since I was at work, I was not going to go back and complain.  These are just kids working, but IF there was a supervisor on duty, MAYBE things like this could be avoided.  I MAY go back to see if it was just a bad day, but we'll see."}
