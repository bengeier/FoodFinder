{"text":"Great meal with great music. Fantastic suggestions for our meal and pint. New spot for meetings and meals after work in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Legit little gastro-pub located at Tomken and Meyerside Drive in Mississauga by the airport. Modern and cozy atmosphere with great wine selection. Had the steak with fries and it was delicious! Will come back again for sure."}
{"text":"The food was delicious but the service was terrible. We had all three waitresses asking us the same questions yet it took us forever to actually get anything. It was frustrating and confusing. Good experience but don't plan to go back."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dining experience here. My husband had the Venison special it was fabulous and I had a Penne Pasta with chicken that was delicious. The service was very kind and friendly to us. I recommend making a reservation they are very busy!"}
{"text":"I try to get to this place 1x every business trip.  Good chance you may meet Oliver and the food is really good.  Tough to decide what to get.  Any pasta is outstanding and the daily special can't be passed up.  Tough call every visit."}
{"text":"Food was good for the most part their wings are amazing craft beers are good overall experience was great."}
{"text":"Disappointed after reading all the reviews. Burgers were mediocre at best - burnt on the exterior and bloody on the inside. Oversized on a dry bun that just fell apart in a bloody mess on the first bite. No sides included with the burgers - house fries were okay but overpriced. Maybe the steaks and pasta are a better option but with only two tables occupied the quality of food served does not justify a gastro pub or gastro anything. 

Impressive beer list but all except 5-6 in cans or bottles. I'd be happier with a smaller selection of rotating taps rather than a massive list of beers of unknown freshness. 

The fact they had a picture of our current premier and prime minister glued in the urinal in the men's washroom only reinforced the perception that this is an establishment of questionable taste."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, good food, and very friendly and accommodating staff. A nice gem hidden in this industrial neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Get the chicken penne pasta!!  It's great!  My boyfriend had French onion soup, I tried it and it was really good.  And most importantly, the service and staff were really nice!  I'll come back here when in the area again."}
{"text":"Fantastic, spectacular, awesome. 
Small hidden gem in an industrial area. In town catching a flight out. 
Food is fantastic, service is excellent, ambiance is great. Can't say one bad thing about this business. 
Found Oliver's through Yelp,reviews were right on."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever eaten in my life. I think it's called the Oliver's special. Worth every penny. Would pay more. Also the friendly staff and atmosphere are top notch. You may find a place out there of equal quality food, but you won't find a place that has better quality food than Oliver's."}
{"text":"I was late in my travels. All I was able to find are fast food and chains that do not really take a dining experience seriously in Mississauga. My wife urged me to check this place, Oliver's Ale, \"their menu looks good and well priced\"... but it was already closed the first night that I landed.

I ended up at Oliver's Ale 3 nights later. It's been a busy week. The moment I opened the door and stepped in, I knew I would like it here. The smell was amazing! I was corrected by the chef, did I mention CHEF?, that it was to be termed aroma. That aroma was exactly what I wanted for dinner. I had to have it. I was served an amazing tangy BBQ burger that came with a hint of spice. It was large... no need for a side they said. Well, maybe a couple of pints Hop City Big Mouth Pale Ales. Also, an excellent choice in beer selections.

The menu is a combined talent by the Chef and Sioux Chef. Excellent choices in wine, spirits and beer by the FOH. Mary Ann (forgive me, I did not write your name down).

Until we meet again, I will have to try everything on the menu eventually!"}
{"text":"Recently had my office Christmas party at Oliver's Ale House.  The location is very close to my office, and I had been excited to check it out.  I believe the entire restaurant was closed for our private event.  The decor was nice, and the wait staff was pretty good.  There was a live band, but they were garbage, and they were set up way too close to all of the tables.  We could hardly speak to each other because of the noise that the band created.

The food was plentiful, but the taste was just \"okay\".  The pasta dish was especially poor (the owner was boasting about how good it would be). 

The owner seemed to have himself parked next to the beer taps all night.  I'm no expert, but I don't believe I ever saw him with an empty glass in his hand during the duration of the evening.  

Because of the rude and inappropriate behavior I have witnessed by the owner of Oliver's Ale House, I will never go there again.  I will also be sure to share my experience with anyone who asks.  I wish the business all the luck in the world, because considering the attitude of the owner, they will need it."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant.  I met the owner and had a great burger.  They were getting ready to close but stayed long enough to cook me some great food.  I had the Oliver Burger and it was huge but perfectly cooked.  Nice combination of flavors."}
{"text":"Some of the best wings I've ever had, and the fries or wedges are fantastic: crisp but super fluffy inside. I came in right before they were closing by accident and the owner happily served me, and I got to chat with the chefs and the owner while having a beer. This place is well worth the walk or drive from the nearby hotels. I came back the second night to try the mussel and beer special. Gourmet food at pub prices."}
{"text":"This is a surprisingly good place, I didn't expect something this good in Mississauga at all. The beer menu is 4-5 pages A4 paper double sided full of beer names, the New York steak is one of the best I've ever had. Oh, don't forget to shake hand with Oliver the owner, he's a 10 year old kid. :)"}
{"text":"Top five steaks and beer I've ever had. I was totally impressed by this intimate, personal-feel joint. Maryanne, the hostess and wife of the chef (and co-owner) was very inviting and made top-notch suggestions for both food and drink. I had the bruschetta, the New York steak, and a random assortment of beers. There wasn't a single part of my meal I didn't enjoy. I come from cattle country (Nebraska, USA), but rate this steak among  the best. I could almost cut it with a butter knife. I had the pleasure of meeting Oliver, the namesake. He's a handsome young gentleman (age 12) with a firm handshake. Shake his hand! It puts $1 in his college savings account! This is a true diamond in the rough. If you're anywhere in the vicinity it's worth a stop."}
{"text":"Mississauga can sometimes feel like a desert of mediocrity, and this is an Oasis.  Though the tap list isn't long, the bottle list is and both are mostly craft.  I'm not sure if Mississaugans (is that what they are?) asked for something besides Molson and Labatt, or these guys think they should, but it's here just the same.  I've only been twice so I can't say much about the food other than that the veal sandwich and burger are above par, and better than anything nearby.  

They are brand new.  Let's hope the community supports this effort.

4 stars for being different."}
{"text":"Good food. Beer selection is good, wish they had Belgium Trappist beers. Nice atmosphere. Easy parking."}
{"text":"Where to start..... buffalo chicken egg rolls are  Burger with the candied jalape√±o bacon is the best I've had. I don't know how this place isn't 5  stars. The best food I've ever had hands down. The beer list is 4-5 pages long and the staff is phenomenal. Highly recommend this place! #notagastropub"}
{"text":"I went to see this place what's all about. The website looked nice and I'm a big fan of Ale beer. The location is a bit isolated but I didn't care much as it wasn't far from my place. My impression the place does not have an identity. They try to be unique which is something Mississauga needs to have. However I feel thier attempt fall short as they try to target multiple themes which left me confused. I wasn't sure if it was a fine dining place, Ale house or a Jazz bar. The on tap selection is very limited which is was disappointing. The menu ranged from $11 burger to $45 steak which was odd. The Jazz band wasn't authentic at all. They refuse to put any sports on TV. They don't seem to know how to sell the beer selection they got and I was left wondering what to order. The burger was burned from outside and bloody inside put on top of cold old Costco bun. The waiters/owner was very annoyed when I complained about the food and was defending the chef. I will not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Make your reservations right now! This place is worth every penny. Although the \"ale house\" in their title can be misleading, this is more of a chop house than an ale house. I had to come here two nights in a row just to be able to try everything I wanted to on their menu. 

First, portion sizes are huge and you will not leave this place hungry. Take the Poutine for example, layered like Lincoln logs several stories high, packed full of so much flavor, is listed as an appetizer. Yet this could easily be a main course. 

Second, let's talk about flavor... everything I ate from their capers salad to the hand rolls spring rolls to the homemade buffalo rolls had out of their world flavor! I cannot stress this enough. If you are searching for bland ordinary food then don't waste your time. However, if you're looking for a fresh spin  on traditional dishes look no further. 

Finally, the service. The bartender who is also the owner provided great conversation and immaculate understanding of the menu and how to pair anything and everything was beyond expectations. 

All and all go and have yourself a great meal, you will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"Four stars for the beer selection, the atmosphere and the customer service. The food looks great but I didn't try it. Not a lot of great craft beer pubs in Missasauga  but Oliver's is fantastic. Big selection of craft beers including a ton of IPAs..."}
{"text":"Outstanding service and delicious food. We had to come all the Way from Pittsburgh Pennsylvania to find this hidden gem and it was 100% worth it!"}
