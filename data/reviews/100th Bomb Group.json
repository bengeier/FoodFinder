{"text":"Went here the other day thinking it was something completely different. Once I found out I couldnt blow anything up, I had a beer and the crab cakes"}
{"text":"This restaurant has given me nothing but bad experiences from the three times I've gone. The food here was overpriced, barely warm, and very much mediocre. The service always seems very rushed and unorganized. As if there were not enough waiters/waitresses. The last time we went, our waiter was very impersonal and barely got our orders before disappearing for most of our dinner. I would definitely not suggest this place to a friend and I will not be coming back here."}
{"text":"Food was very good, was a little bit pricey for the portion you got.  My wife and I ate there and the bill was $60 for us, and we didn't have any alcoholic beverages.  Very nice setting but the wait staff was very dull and not well informing."}
{"text":"Scott and Thomas are the best bartenders!!!  Great conversation and outstanding customer service!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"We gathered for our anniversary celebration, 6 people. It was a Saturday and there were 2 weddings. Our server was good . 2 people in our party wanted prime rib and they were out of prime rib? The waitress had to find steak knives, they had none. Half way through the meal she found some, bread came towards the end of the meal and no specials were read to us, that was forgotten. Some of the meat was overdone. No one said much, except for how the food was pricey and I think it could have tasted a lot better. Its a beautiful atmosphere, but I wouldn't recommend going when they have other big parties. Weddings are planned in advance, so to run out of prime rib and steak should not have happened."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. After being seated we waited for close to 20 minutes as the waitresses worked tables around us. Couldn't even get anyone's attention. Decided to go elsewhere.  Should note that it wasn't even busy. Couldn't tell you whether or not the water was any good because we didn't even have that."}
{"text":"Overpriced. can get what we got anywhere. No seasoning. bad menu. Pathetic slice of prime rib. Might be good for catering but not dining. Amateurs."}
{"text":"My family went here for a special occasion weekday lunch. We generally liked the food (not amazing, but not bad), but the service was inattentive and slow. We were a big group - 15 - which I know can be a pain for servers, but we're not a demanding group and either way, we're customers. We just wanted someone to do more than take our orders and bring the first round of drinks. No follow up, so we weren't able to order more drinks or even get water. One of us had to grab silverware from another table and another one had to go find us some water."}
{"text":"I was invited to Sunday brunch for my cousin's birthday. EVERYTHING was excellent. The staff was attentive & courteous. They had a wide variety of food & desserts. This is my new go to brunch spot."}
{"text":"Service was super slow, waitress was unfriendly, food was mediocre at best, and the prices are way to high!  The only good thing about this place was the outdoor patio, and the view of the airplanes landing at the airport.  I could see coming here for drinks, and socializing at the outdoor patio, but forget about the food."}
{"text":"We heard so much about this place  we were excited to bring an out of town guest with us to try it for our first time. Boy were we disappointed. I have several food allergies so I explained my situation to our server, she was very rude about it to our face and  the restaurant was not very accommodating.  Our food was not very tasteful and the shrimp fettuccine make my boyfriend sick after he eat. We will never go there again."}
{"text":"I had a very enjoyable experience recently for lunch on a Saturday with my mother and toddler. The restaurant wasn't very busy so the hostess seated us at a nice window-table where we had great views of the airports. My son loved the planes!

Our server was attentive and took extra measures to make sure my son was having a good time. 

The food was good. I had a burger/fries and my mom had a chicken sandwich. The prices seem a bit high for what you get, but I can overlook that for an enjoyable time with family. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"For some reason we have to come to a company party here every year.  The food could be the worst thing I have ever ate.  How does this place not realize most of the food comes back on the plate.  The steak is like cardboard, everything is always overcooked and the vegan dish looks like vomit on plate.  Save your money!"}
{"text":"Went for our annual family holiday brunch today.  For the past few years we've gone to Pier W and thoroughly enjoyed it, but decided to change it up this year.  Despite living on the southwest side my entire life, I'd never been to 100th.  What a great decision!  We couldn't have been happier with the quality and selection of the brunch, the decor of the restaurant and especially the fantastic service of the entire staff - especially our wonderful server Lynn.  We will be back - more often than then holiday brunch too!  Can't beat the price as well.  Yes, the other place I mentioned gives you a lake view, but I can't think of any other advantage they have over the Bomb Group."}
{"text":"100th Bomb Group located on Brookpark Road stands out like a sore thumb.  After the relocation of a runway at Hopkins they forced the closure of the old location.  The old version was a real gem.  I will never forget how they had headsets at each table that you could listen to Hopkins ATC while eating.  Very Cool!  

The new location(Which has been here for several years now) is breathtaking.  They spent some serious money to make this place memorable.  The inside has awesome features and big widows to give you a nice vantage point of the airfield.  (Perfect to watch the 3 regional jets that depart every hour).  

As a fellow Yelper has posted, the bar has some free munchies during happy hour which is a nice touch.  My problem with the Bomb Group is it is a bit stuffy for my liking.  If i want to watch planes, I don't want it to be a white tablecloth event.  The entrees are good, however you will be paying about 20 dollars per plate.  The food could have better taste for what you are paying.

The outdoor deck and patio are beautiful, and during the summer they have great drink specials.  Hope this helps!"}
{"text":"The Sunday Brunch was awesome. Variety of food was great and the wait staff was attentive and efficient. Our reservation was easily made and the wait staff was informed of our airline departure time before we arrived. The children claimed it to be the best restaurant ever."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch.  Food was mediocre, but plentiful selection.  Service was hit or miss as the waitresses rotate through the dining room, no ONE person responsible for your table.

What this restaurant needs is a manager who is focused on the operation of the restaurant and the customer's experience.  Not on booking the next big catering event.

Some of the more minor items that distracted from our $30pp dining experience:
1.  Trash in the parking lot from some wild drinking binge the night before.  Glass everywhere.  Every employee had to see that coming to work, right??
2. The carpet took the loafer right off of my foot.  It was that sticky and smelly.  This was while we were walking to our table!  What manager would let the carpet in his dining room get to that state of disrepair and filth?
3. ONE chef making omelets and waffles.  Only ONE.  Really?
4. With the roving waitresses we HAD to ask for refills on our iced teas.
5. The prime rib was pot roast.  Dark as the bottom of my shoe and not a drop of juice coming from the roast.  Not one person got a slice the entire hour we were there.
6. The fish dish was excellent but the high heat of the warmer an completely dried the fish and the sauce in no time.  There was no water or olive oil in the bottom of the pan to keep the fish moist while warm.  Restaurant 101.
7.  The large decanter of cranberry juice was leaking all over the table and onto the floor, but not one of the staff noticed it until it was pointed out to them.
8. The desserts were plentiful but out of a box.
9. While I like my bacon under done, the first pan of bacon was almost raw.  They eventually took it away and brought a batch of properly cooked bacon the second time.
 
It's a great facility with great potential.  I have a feeling that the catering side of the house is supporting the place with such little attention to detail in the restaurant.  Based on the other comments here, I think that is an accurate assessment."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is a beautiful building-and the atmosphere is great inside and especially out on the patio. The french onion soup was very good-the caesar salad was gross. The croutons were stale and inedible. The fish and chips..
a \"guest favorite\"....horrible. We're supposed to trust the Gordon's fisherman but not at a restaurant-there was so much beer battering it was ridiculous..and so close to one of the biggest freshwater lakes in the country. And to top it off ...freezer aisle fries. Cmon. Their prices are the same as Pier W...and they should charge what applebees charges. Also good lord were their drinks weak. Also, lava cake should have lava. And the ice cream should not come from drug mart if you are asking the prices they ask. Ugh. Not going back."}
{"text":"Mother's day brunch was amazing! Staff was great, food was perfect! Most important thing was Mom was happy!"}
{"text":"Service was outstanding. Food was pure comfort. Great date night location overlooking the runways at Cleveland Hopkins Airport.

{"text":"This review is in response to their catering department. My family and I stopped in to meet with Liz this week to plan my grandmother's bereavement lunch. We spent a good amount of time with her discussing plated lunch menu options, set up of the room, and other details as we wanted this lunch to be perfect in celebration of of her life. Liz did not seem to know every detail of the menu options she was presenting, but she told us that she would speak with the chef that night or the morning after to see if they could accommodate our menu requests and follow-up with us right away. We had not heard back from Liz the next day so I called to find out that she was not even in the office. We spoke to another woman who told us that they would not have the staff to accommodate a plated lunch. We spent about an hour at this place in the midst of grieving for my grandmother, and that entire time was wasted. This place is extremely unorganized and we are very upset by the entire experience, especially at a time like this."}
{"text":"We went for my husbands birthday dinner, mostly because of the reviews of the views from the patio. We did sit on the patio and had great airport views. We started off with the short rib perogies, which were hearty, and pretty tasty. My husband ordered a draft beer, which was unavailable due to an issue with their keg, so he had to settle on a bottle beer. I had a copper mug mule, which was average tasting. Dinner took so long to come that we were given a free desert, to be honest we hadn't even noticed because we were having a great time and enjoying the view. There was a decent band playing as well. When dinner did finally come, it was less than impressive, considering our $100+ bill. He ordered a New York strip steak which was a very fatty cut. There was much of the steak he couldn't eat. I ordered the salmon, which was dressed with shallots, green beans, and a variety of other vegetables over risotto. While the dressing of the salmon was good, the salmon was mediocre, much less than average. Also, the green beans were so undercooked they were crunchy. Overall, the salmon was very bland. While we very much enjoyed ourselves, the views and the server were good and we enjoyed the band, we have buyers remorse after paying such a large bill for less than average food. If we were to go back, we would probably only do so for a happy hour or light meal."}
{"text":"I usually come here once a year for dinner and have yet to try it out for brunch. Food is very good and service is always great! If you sit by the window you can also see the planes go by at the airport across the street."}
{"text":"Service was excellent.  Great food for an Easter brunch.  Thanks especially to the service from Laurie, Sandy, Natasha and the manager Jamie."}
{"text":"Where do I BEGIN. We are yearly diners here for Thanksgiving. Each year, getting a little bit different in how things were done, BUT, THIS YEAR, the worse ever. A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. The check in ladies were great as usual. Our server was great. The carving guy Jeff was great as usual. The other lady at the carving station was fabulous. The food..... Oh My God!! DOWNHILL!!! No turkey carving station, no mashed potatoes, no variety of breads, teenie weenie desserts, like a teenie piece of pumpkin pie, no pork loin like previous years, when the turkey came out, it was saturated in gravy!! Had to wait for clean plates. New chef and management. You have ran it into the ground. ALL THAT MONEY and less food each year... I seen tons of people complaining. The stuffing was not even stove top quality. UGH... I liked it when it used to be set up in the big rooms. SLOWLY AND SLOWLY each year, it got smaller and smaller. No sticky buns, no big cheese display with crackers, less side dishes, no butternut squash raviolis, no stuffed flounder.... I mean, it was really not worth coming. I got all excited to get disappointed. The prime rib and ham were excellent. The breakfast items were overcooked and very scarce. The crepe lady was on her game. The temps you hired for this year, whose idea was that?? They were friendly and sympathetic with ALL the complaining. We are not coming for Christmas, and will really be weighing our options for next Thanksgiving and also, why give less and charge more?? This is really going to cost you as I will go on ALL the sites to boast my opinion and Open Table is next. Not worth the money. Whoever is running this place should not be, they should stick to running the snack bar..."}
{"text":"I booked the Rosenthal room at the 100th Bomb Group because I have attended a few other events at this venue and enjoyed the food and the atmosphere..  The event I booked was the \"Celebration of Life\" luncheon following my father's funeral.  Apparently, there is a generic \"Celebration of Life\" menu consisting of herbed chicken and roast beef, so I was not offered the a choice of menu items.  

While the venue is very attractive and the service was excellent, I was very disappointed in the food.  First of all, it was cold.  I don't mean a little cold.  My biggest disappointment came when I saw the chicken.  All huge chicken legs.......no white meat.  I would have  happily paid more for white meat had it been offered.  Unfortunately, I assumed that the chicken entrée would be assorted pieces.  As a result, we ran out of the roast beef because no one was taking the chicken.  There was a whole pan left.  Quite a waste of over $1000.00.  

I rarely write reviews but as the event was only yesterday, this is still bothering me.  My advice to anyone booking an event at the 100th Bomb Group is:  be sure to ask questions!  Don't assume anything!"}
{"text":"Great place. I use to go here with my parents when I was a child. I remember it being bigger."}
{"text":"I loved the brunch at 100th Bomb Group!  There was a fabulous selection and the quality of the food was good, if not great.  I enjoy the service most of all and the atmosphere of being relaxed and not rushed.  The waitress was super attentive and extremely friendly and pleasant.

My only little complaint was that the seafood was obviously a low quality (crab legs with little meat, shrimp with the veins still attached) and there weren't any bagels to go with the lox.  If they just upped the quality a little bit it would be perfect!  

Overall though I enjoyed it very much and recommend a visit."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go here for awhile now since we always host events for work here. I finally got to go here with my boyfriend and his family, and it was good. The food was OK, the service was good, and it was a little pricey (They charged $36 for a bottle of wine that I just bought for myself for $8 at the grocery store, but I understand that is how restaurants make $$). We all split the battered green beans, which were delicious, and then I got the scallops, which were also good. Overall, it was a good experience, but it wasn't more than average in my books. The idea behind the concept is cool, but the space definitely needs updated. I would like to come back when it is warm out to see the patios with the fire pits in action."}
{"text":"Our visit to the 100th Bomb Group last night was disappointing. The building is spacious, with a view of the planes landing and taking off. The fireplaces and bookcases lend ambiance, but the quality of the food fell short of our expectations.  Three of us ordered French Onion soup which we sent back because the broth was watered down and bland. The Beer Cheese soup was more palatable but still, no hint of a beer flavor. The artichoke dip appetizer was served with pita bread and probably the best I've ever tasted. Battered green beans were greasy and stuck together in clumps. My husband's Cesar salad did not appear to have been tossed in dressing, just served with a minuscule cup of dressing on the side. Greens included brown wilted pieces and croutons looked store-bought. He barely touched the salad.
I ordered the scallops which were large and slightly overlooked but adequate.  Green beans were way undercooked and although I love green beans I only ate one of them. Our drinks were outstanding. Lemon drop martini was exemplary and I was more than pleased with the Old Fashioned served with a Luxardo cherry. They were both strong and they should be at $12 each. The New York cheesecake did not disappoint and was served with good, fresh coffee. Our waitress was attentive and accommodating.  I am sorry to say that we will not be returning to the restaurant as I feel the food is hit-and-miss and should be better for the price."}
{"text":"Used to love this place years ago in the old location before rebuilt. Stopped in for drinks and apps. Great Bloody Marys but don't order the spinach artichoke dip. Menu said served with warm pita bread. Turns out the pita bread was deep fried, coupled with pound of butter in the dip, The urge to purge was immediate. Service was good but yuck on that app"}
{"text":"We have enjoyed the buffets for holidays, specifically Thanksgiving and Easter.  There are so many tantalizing choices.  The food is presented in an appetizing manner.  The buffet is continuously restocked and maintained.  The servers are polite and present.  The view of Cleveland Hopkins Airport is beautiful.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is the price - it is somewhat pricey, although you do get what you pay for."}
{"text":"While staying at the Cleveland Airport Sheraton on a recent business trip, I asked the front desk for a nearby steakhouse and they recommended 100th Bomb Group, which they recommend to everyone. I asked what the next restaurant they would recommend was and they said Applebee's. No offense to Ricky Bobby, but 100th Bomb Group it is!

Location -  the restaurant is located directly across from Cleveland Hopkins Airport and is about a 4 mile drive from the Sheraton. It's also near the Car Rental area, so dropping off the car and catching a shuttle back to the airport was very convenient. The restaurant is massive with a patio area for outdoor dining. The interior is fairly swanky and offers a \"nice\" view of the airport. Personally, a nice view consists of gorgeous landscapes or a sunset over the ocean, but for those that played Sim City, you know areas around airports are desolate, so you take what you can get.

Food - The bread service comes w/ butter and a delicious pesto/cheese/pine nut spread (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0youcKV6-eE3F2MQj1l6Fw?select=ZWyuXH-zrzA1C9FD4xu07w). The beer cheese soup ($2.95 add-on) was creamy and savory, and it was the soup that kept on giving as I was burping it up long after the meal was over. The 3/4lb of prime rib ($24.95, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0youcKV6-eE3F2MQj1l6Fw?select=wjFL8mIoYKK2N_KKDyxV1A) was a good sized cut with enough fat to flavor the meat, but not so much that you had a pile of cold, hardened fat on your plate at the end of the meal. The crust was superb and the beef was good. Esp. considering the price point, it's not a bad deal at all. Make sure you ask for their fresh horseradish. YUM!

The sides were just ok. I prefer my mashed potatoes to be mashed a bit more and the veggies were necessary to balance out the protein intake...you know, to aid in the bombs I'd be dropping later.

Service - they bring a carafe of water, so no complaints about glasses being empty. Service was friendly and on point for our visit.

The meal wasn't anything to write home about--hence the 4 stars--but if I'm ever in Cleveland again, I'm definitely making it a point to stop by the 100th Bomb Group.

P.S. For those in the DC area, this is pretty similar to the 94th Aero Squadron in College Park."}
{"text":"Best part is the manger called me to elaborate on my review.  I was kind enough to do so and her suggestion was to try other restaurants they operate in LA and report back.  On MY DIME!!!


Thanks.  No"}
{"text":"The Sunday brunch used to be so scrumptious, boy have things changed.  We dined around noon time on a recent Sunday.  I'll start off with the crab legs, when they were available they were small and dirty looking.  They reminded me of the ones you get at the Chinese buffet when you pay $12.99.  The beef was overdone, and tasteless.  There was an nearly empty tray of unidentifiable food during our entire visit, which was well over an hour.  It's so sad because this has been a go-to for our family for many years.  I really don't think we'll be back unless there are confirmed changes.  For the price you can provide the same quality we've come to expect from past experiences."}
{"text":"I've been here once with my fiancée and her coworkers for a dinner.  We had a party of 8 or so and the service was definitely sub-par.  Most ordered from a prix fixe menu, which had each course paired with a wine.  I started with a beer (at least I intended to), but it came well after the wine for the first course arrived, after reminding our server.  Unfortunately, she also forgot the dessert wine with our last course.  Shame on us for not having remembered until after we left, but our party was ready to leave after the slow service for the duration of the night.

I ordered a salmon dish that was generally good, but seemed to have been overly salted.  It's too bad because it would have been really good without the extra sodium.  Wines were paired nicely, but dessert was late to arrive and was over-baked and a bit dried out.

Despite the nice atmosphere and ambience, being next to the airport, it's difficult to overcome poor service and forgotten items.  In terms of value, I'd say the 100th Bomb Group was average for the food and wine compared to the cost.  The menu was not overpriced.  I would have a hard time recommending this restaurant and likely will not return myself.  This review represents a 2.5 star rating."}
{"text":"Very creative and awesome decor the tribute to veterans was amazing!! One star short simply because I was attending an event so I didn't get a chance to checkout the menu, or waitstaff"}
{"text":"We went here for brunch with a party of 30 for my grandmas 90th birthday. Not only was the food amazing, the service was also top notch. On top of that, the decor inside and outside was awesome. Overall, we had a wonderful experience and definitely will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Nice brunch venue been here a dozen times for brunch or dinner food is consistence nice theme had good service and prices are fair"}
{"text":"We did mother's day here and we were greatly impressed.  Oysters on the half shell, 4 different types of salmon! From A to Z, they had it covered!

Service was outstanding!"}
{"text":"They put out munchies during happy hour, always a plus. They have a really cool rooftop and patio. It is really pretty during the spring and summer when the grass surrounding the place is bright green. 

I think this place is a nice place to go for a dinner with the parents, or go up to the rooftop for a grown-up romantic time. I think the rooftop could be romantic with the right person."}
{"text":"We went here after the Cleveland Auto Show, on a Friday evening. The hostess was busy on the phone when we arrived, so we had to wait a bit, and we didn't have a reservation, but we were seated by a window and could see the planes coming and going. We ordered the prime rib with potatoes and green beans. our meals were very good and our server was great. Our meat was cooked the way we requested and the presentation was nice. All in all a very pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Okay so usually I'm not harsh with my reviews, but this one is going to hurt. Took my family here for dinner last night. It had been a while since I had been here and was hoping it had gotten better. 

We had seven o'clock reservations. Upon arrival we were told to wait a few minutes while the hostess was writing something. She didn't even look up at us to tell us. No one was waiting. In fact there was barely anyone there. First bad sign. Then she finally looked up at us and asked how many. I mentioned we had reservations for four. 

She brought us to our table and sat us. Our waitress came up pretty quick And brought us water. Took our drink and appetizer order. Ordered calamari and the spinach and artichoke dip and a bottle of wine. 

After ordering, she came out with bread which was good actually. She had said the wine we ordered wasn't available and offered a different one. We said it was fine and she left it with us. No ice bucket to keep it cold as it was a chilled wine. 

She came back with our appetizer of spinach and artichoke dip and I asked was the calamari coming out behind it , to which she replied what calamari? We said the one we ordered with it. She said oh I must have forgotten that one. She offered no apology and put that order in and took our dinner order at the same time. 

The calamari came just a few minutes before our dinner was served. It was mostly red cabbage , banana peppers and roasted red peppers and a Thai sauce. Which whole flavorful there was hardly any calamari and what was there was over cooked to the point of crunchy fried chunks of baby squid. 

Soon after as I said our dinners arrived. We ordered pot roast and fish and chips. Their menu was super limited from what it used to be. My fish and chips looked appealing. Nice big piece of white fish lightly  battered served on a bed of fries and red cabbage again. 

The fries were barely warm. The fish was nice and hot but had zero seasoning or flavor my cole slaw was frozen solid. When I told the waitress she laughed and said they have cooler issues and offered to try and find an unfrozen one. I said no as I was done eating by them. I was told the pot roast was good by my date but I didn't try it. 

For a $120.00 meal for two adults and 2 children under five Applebee's or Ruby Tuesdays would have Even better options and half the cost but far better food! I don't mind spending $$$$ on food that's good but this was far from it. As was the service. As I said for a Friday night this place was dead and it shows why from a service standpoint and food quality and price point. 

We will not be back. It's sad really because it's a great destination location with its views of the airport and the jets taking off and landing. They did away with the headsets they used to have to listen to the air traffic control tower, not a big deal. This was my second time I've been there since they remodeled and as I said will not be back for a third. 

In the cleveland area we have access to some great restaurants. Years ago this used to be one. It's kept it's prices high but for that money your better off going to Strip, Blue Pointe, Lago, or any of the other upscale establishments around the area. You'll get the quality you pay for."}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite restaurant. I would always want to go for my birthday. But it's slowly gone down hill. Went for their New Year's Eve party which was advertised as surf and turf. It was a fatty piece of roast beef and a gross white fish I could only took one bight of. Love the atmosphere but the food and service has declined."}
{"text":"Friday after work I stop in for a good meal, eat at the bar, bartender was sort of getto, he provided service however in this higher end restaurant management should aim to polish this young man.  The prime rib dinner was a wise selection.  I did enjoy the happy hour price for the wine.  That fire place offers a great feel on a cold day."}
{"text":"To make a long story short, go elsewhere (for dinner, at least). There are plenty of other great, unique dining options in Cleveland that will provide better quality and value. The descriptions on the menu did not reflect the finished product, and the quality of food is not worth the price tag.

I went here for a family dinner with my mom, sister and husband. Service was a bit slow, but I'll give our server a break considering she looked about 8 months pregnant and had half the dining room. The reason for the 2 stars was the disappointing food. 

Our starters were OK- bruscetta, wedge salad and french onion soup. All typical. 

My sister had the vegetarian pasta primavera. It was OK, but last time I checked, pasta primavera is not supposed to be spicy and this dish had me (and everyone else) chugging water. 

My husband ordered the crab cake. It was good, but nothing to write home about. 

I ordered the prosciutto risotto. It was decent, except that the \"prosciutto\" looked and tasted suspiciously like canadian bacon. 

My mom ordered the lobster special, described as half of a lobster tail. What arrived was half of the smallest whole lobster (not tail) I have ever seen. Literally, there was 2 bites of actual, edible lobster meat and it looked undercooked. For $32? Ridiculous. She sent it back and fared with a wedge salad and sampling the rest of our mediocre entrees. The server apologized profusely (for something that was in no way her fault) and mentioned that we were not the first person to send it back that evening. Then the (presumably) manager came over. She asked us what we expected based on the server's explanation (trying to blame someone other than the crappy cook) and told us it was supposed to be lobster thermidor. Yeah, it was not even close...she needs to Google lobster thermidor.

Personally, I was very disappointed. I had my wedding here and the food was great, so I figured if they could cook that well for 120 people, dinner for 4 should be delicious. Wrong."}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed with this place it looks beautiful the service was good and the food was okay but the place was so COLD we could not enjoy our evening. I think their only heating system is the fireplace and with a party of 8 we where seated at the back of the room. So if you do decide to eat here my recommendation is to sit close to the fireplace in the winter."}
{"text":"The 100th Bomb Group is a bizarre, BIZARRE mash-up of sensibilities.  

On the one hand, it's near the airport and features huge plastic models of airplanes and jeeps strewn about the grounds - so naturally, you'd think it's some sort of ghastly playground-themed restaurant, and when you walked in the waiters would wear camouflage helmets and snap to attention with a \"YOUR ORDER, SIR!\" when you walked in.  

So imagine your surprise when you walk in and find what is attempting to be an elegant restaurant, with cloth tablecloths, high-end dishes, and a menu that is fairly spendy.  

Your best bet is to come early in the evening, well before sunset, and go up on the roof for drinks.  You can watch the planes take off as you buzzbomb your consciousness with overpriced beer, in a convivial atmosphere.  It's definitely a swell way to spend a night, and unfortunately we haven't been able to make it to the dance nights they have.  

If you wander downstairs, the food is pretty good - I knock off a star for the prices, but if the entrees were about three to five bucks cheaper it'd be just fine.  As it is, yes, I can't shake off the feeling that I'm paying for big plastic planes.  

The food is fairly straightforward - it's American cuisine, with steaks and chicken and nice bread, served on bone-white plates.  Nothing fancy, but nothing poorly done either; it won't exactly tickle the palates of your foodie friends, but it won't make them retch either.  

In the end, this is a great guest restaurant.  If your parents are in from out of town, bring them here!  They'll love it, and it's not a bad place to go out to eat.  But as for eating here regularly, I'd find it a little rich for my blood AND I'd find the menu to be fairly shallow.  

In short: Very nice, within swinging distance of four stars.  A little less, I'd be happy to come here regularly."}
{"text":"We arrived with a party of 11 and we were seated immediately. Our servers were great and very friendly. The selection of food was diverse and well prepared. I chose to have a Veggie omelette which was made to perfection. I would recommend to everyone Brunch if you can."}
{"text":"We attended last night's New Year's Eve party. We were willing to pay the $95.00 per-person fee because it seemed like such a promising event and a fun way to ring in 2016.  

However, after about an hour, it was apparent that we made the wrong choice. The sea bass was undercooked/cold, the mashed potatoes were always out, the beef reminded me of the quality of a Banquet TV dinner, and it took over 30 minutes to order and receive a drink at the open-bar. The bartenders could not accommodate simple drinks, such as a dirty martini, saying that they did not have the knowledge to make it. The only enjoyable part was the band.

For such an establishment and price-point, we expected much more from the food quality and bar service. Another attendee mentioned that the food was out-sourced...? We hope that this is not the truth. 

We were disappointed and will probably not be back as long as the current quality and service permits."}
{"text":"I dined here on a Saturday night with a friend. Our first clue that the food was not going to be good should have been that the dining room was virtually A ghost town on what should have  been a very busy night of the week.  It was so desolate that I think that I may have seen a tumbleweed blow by our table. 

The food came out of the kitchen lukewarm, and looked like it had been sitting for a while. The flavor was mediocre, and I actually think that description may be a little bit too kind.  It wasn't as terrible as high school cafeteria food, but I definitely could've paid half the price and ordered almost any other pasta dish at the Olive Garden and had better quality food. The $28 that I paid for this entrée which did not come with a salad was definitely just short of robbery.

Our meal before the tip came to around $80. I regularly eat in restaurants in this price range, but I can assure you this one is not worthy of what they charge.  The only thing redeeming about our visit was that the waitstaff were all very friendly and helpful. Their professionalism helped make our experience a little bit better. Otherwise, this place place seems to have lost its culinary soul, and appears to just be a shell of what used to be a nice, upscale establishment."}
{"text":"Did the Mother's Day brunch. Way below average and overpriced. Omelettes and waffles good, but not worth the money."}
{"text":"Four of us went last night (a Saturday night) after an event at the IX center. Within walking into the front doors things started off on a not so great foot. The hostess looked less than thrilled, as she was preparing to seat a party of 11, with 2 other groups waiting to be seated as well. When it was finally our turn she replied \"oh, a walk in\" when she learned we did not have a reservation. 

She initially began to seat us in the lounge, but knowing it was a nicer establishment we requested to be seated in the dining room. She obliged but warned the service will be slower. 

At this point it took us over an hour to get drinks and receive our meals. They were clearly understaffed for a Saturday night especially with a large event going on at the IX center nearby. 

My mother in law said her salad was good but dressing was not on side as requested. 
My father in laws steak meal was cold. 
My husband and I ordered prime rib with mashed potatoes and an underwhelming cheese muffin thing. We were content with our meal and also enjoyed a good wedge salad and French onion soup. 

Overall, slowwwwwwwww service and the price is too high for the quality/warmth of the food. The waitress had been busting her butt all evening keeping up with her tables. A man in a suit, maybe a manager??, was even bussing tables, delivering meals, etc. I had only been there once years ago and wanted this most recent experience to be a lot better than it had turned out to be. 

The location and idea is great, but the execution needs work."}
{"text":"Probably top 3 for the worst service we have ever received..... Sunday night 4 wait staff and maybe 5 tables active, our server came by asked for drink order, ordered 3 drinks and waters, she leaves and comes back with water 10 minutes later. Drinks followed about another 5 minutes out. Never asked if we wanted an appetizer, so we skipped it. Took our dinner order and disappeared for another 10 to 15 minutes, no offer of a second drink. Soup and salad arrive and she asks who has what, we are your only table!! Dinner arrives before we can finish our soup/salad. Food is good, but steaks were all past medium as ordered. Sides were passable, but the popovers are a joke, it was like a hockey puck with no puff at all.
Server comes back after we are done to clear plates, still no offer of a second drink during the meal...... comes back with the check, never asks if we would like dessert.
Don't know how the staff is trained, but our server did have EAT in the middle of her name, but didn't seem to care if we did or not.
We were in town on the way home from a great trip to the football hall of fame, this was a seriously bummer of an ending to a great trip.... $160 plus for 3 people....... sad for a place with a military theme, definitely no discipline or attention to detail to be found."}
{"text":"Celebrated a high school reunion.  About 150 guests.  The meal choice was chicken parmigiana or salmon.  The chicken was very overcooked and the salmon not baked.   Cake served was dry seemed like around too long.   Overall, dissatisfied and would not recommend"}
{"text":"Tim was an extremely efficient, kind, thoughtful, and basically awesome-in-general waiter. The food was great and a good value. The decor is beautiful and also comfortable. What else can I say? If you're hungry and out near the airport, it's a no-brainer! Come to One Hundredth Bomb Group!"}
{"text":"We attended a Mother's Day brunch this visit; and I've eaten at the restaurant for other gatherings for dinner. We have never had a great experience and this trip was unfortunately the same. The dining facility itself is nice, some of the dining areas are out of date, old chairs, decor, etc. we luckily got a window view which was nice to see the planes. The brunch was set up down the hall and was quite unorganized, it's a very long walk especially for kids or older adults to be carrying food. The food stations were all over the place, and no way to have lines, people were just everywhere. The food was pretty mediocre especially for the high price. The pancakes literally had hard crusts like they were old, and the rest of the food followed suite- bland and blah. Presentation was nice, ice carvings, and dessert table looked beautiful. Service was fair, but not much else notable. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Please don't go here unless you have nothing to do. Last 3 times I have been there the service has been so slow it's unbearable!  I think the food is good but it never comes hot.  Sometimes undercooked. I hate to leave a bad review but it deems it."}
{"text":"So I finally made it to this place and I think it's really great. There is a lot of charm in the little banquet rooms and I can see why there are a lot of weddings and parties there. 
I was there for a family reunion and it was a perfect venue. The food was good. The only complaint was the fishiest ceasar salad ever. It also wasn't tossed in the dressing, which I thought was weird. But otherwise, everything was great. The bread especially was fantastic. 

My main recommendation is that they thicken the hedges along the street side of the venue. Especially by the wedding courtyard. Yay for seeing planes, boo for seeing cars and trucks zooming by. 

Great outdoor patio and really cool bar inside. I'm looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Not as good as a dining experience as we've had another bomb group restaurants.  Unfortunately this is the only one still standing near us very little remains of the Old World War 2 English Air Base motif. Will not hurry back"}
{"text":"3 1/2 STARS

This is still the best restaurant near the Cleveland Airport.

I stopped in for dinner and had the bruschetta appetizer and the cedar plank salmon with mashed potatoes (a huge serving) and spinach. All quite good, accompanied by a California cabernet

This place is trying hard, with white table cloths & all, but the quality is merely good, not great. Examples: the bruschetta was on a thick French bread roll cut in half, the spinach was a little greasy from the added bacon and the salmon was farm raised (this is an  AVOID on the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch List).

Still, it's the best around and certainly worth a visit.

Food - 3 1/2 STARS
Ambiance - 3 STARS
Service - 4 STARS"}
{"text":"Well, several meals here over the years, and at least I can say it's consistent ...  Consistently mediocre.  Not going to waste my time writing more on the dining experience.  It has atmosphere, certainly, but it's too bad the food doesn't measure up.  Don't settle for mediocre, go over to the Marriott Hotel on 150th for a great meal at AMP 150."}
{"text":"The food was expensive, doesn't have taste, cold vegetables, dry burger... I don't recommend!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here for so many years.  Our friends won a gift card, so we all came for dinner on Saturday.

The food was fabulous!  Between the 4 of use we had pot roast, short rib pierogis, strip steak, and prime rib.  Everything was great.  The strip was so tender and flavorful.

Server was a little slow getting our drinks and cashing us out, but she may have had other tables in another portion of the restaurant.

My only complaint is that the shrub in front of the window is so high that none of us could see the planes take off or land.  That's part of the uniqueness of this venue, so why block the view!!!"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant while in town for a friend's wedding. We were here for the rehearsal dinner so the food was served buffet style and was very good. The place is huge and they have lots of separate rooms that all overlook the airport. We had some pasta and chicken parmesan and the chicken was outstanding. Their desserts were very good as well."}
{"text":"Place was not clean. Buffet was totally picked over. No utensils to pick up desserts. Other guests were using their hands. No one working the stations--so no french toast or made to order omelette.  Beef on the carving station was not Prime Rib...but that's what they told us it was. No turkey at the carving station. Had to wait twice for plates for the buffet--and it wasn't even that busy. 
Staff was polite and nice. 
Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I really disappointed the way this restaurant has gone in the last 7 years. I used to work and eat here. The service was not up to par and the food looked and tasted like if it came out a can. I should know, im a cook. Maybe I should come back and tun the kitchen because im wasn't impressed at all. They didn't even have crayons for my niece to color with. WTH!!"}
{"text":"My Family and I went there for New Years Eve 2015. We were seated promptly and that is the only nice thing I can say about this restaurant. We sat down for 8:30 reservations and when the waitress finally came to our table we were told that from there New Year's Eve menu that the Steak and Lobster they were out of plus a few other entrees and appetizers. After a hour and half wait we finally got our salads and waited another 40 minutes to get entrees. They were all undercooked and cold and the appearance resembled that of dog food. My husband ordered a Beer and they ran out of glasses! As the restaurant slowly started to empty our service continued to deteriorate. The manager explained that they did not have a Chef! That was obvious! It has a nice view and they need to make the restaurant smaller and get more help! We were so disappointed and we will NOT be returning! We were hoping that McDonalds was open so that we could get the Cav's  Dinner Box!! Don't waste your time and money going to this restaurant it is the WORST!!"}
{"text":"Man I would not take my cat here to eat.  Service was slow and surley.  The food was terrible and the decor was bad.  You wold be better off eating in the Airport front lobby."}
{"text":"My reservation was basically cancelled 90 minutes before scheduled by the restaurant. To their credit, their power had been out and had a limited menu. But to cancel my reservation on a Saturday night left us high and dry for my parent's 40th wedding anniversary. I won't be making another reservation."}
{"text":"Doesn't even deserve one star! Went for the Mother's Day buffet and we were absolutely disgusted. The buffet was dirty, food was cold and tasteless and the prime rib was dry. Absolutely disgusted!  It cost 40 per person for nothing. My whole family left still hungry and highly disappointed, will not be going back and would not recommend to anyone ever!"}
{"text":"This was the second time I ate at the 100th Bomb group and just as It had the first time, the service was good and the food was good also. I asked to be seated in the window seat and the hostess was able to fulfill my Request, The waitress was polite and cheerful and very attentive to us, I had the cedar plank salmon and it was done very well the potatoes and vegetables to come with it are okay. All in all a good dining experience and I will Be back. If they re-carpet will probably get better atmosphere review."}
{"text":"Wow. This place is completely UNprofessional. I am a single father and didn't really want to cook out on Father's Day. So I called on Tuesday and made reservations for 4 at 230pm on Sunday. Today is Friday and I get a phone call from them. Hi, she said, I had a message stating that you'd like to make reservations for Sunday! Huh???? Not Only did I NOT have reservations, but they had my name, phone number, They also had my party size. After looking at their yelp page, something I should do BEFORE, this isn't all that surprising. As a final insult to me, the lady who called said I was right and this shouldn't be the case, asked if she could transfer me to her manager, Mark something....he'd be right with me. Did I get mark? No, she transferred me to some woman's VOICEMAIL......I guess they were all to busy to do the right thing. 


DONT GO HERE. EVER. It's not worth the hassle, you may expect upscale, but you receive NO scale.....such a shame."}
{"text":"The restaurant is in a great location with views of the airport. Inside has an old time, classic vibe. The food is expensive.  It's downtown pricing but it's Applebees quality AT BEST. My friend and I both got pasta dishes. His shrimp was lukewarm. I got chicken parm. I expect flattened pieces of chicken but not just one at the price. Neither of us had much pasta, the cheapest food item to offer customers. My cheese was not melted on the chicken. This wasn't due to the crowd as the entire restaurant seemed to have only a half dozen tables on a Saturday night. We each had a soup/salad, an entree, dessert, and iced tea. Our bill was over $70. Never again. 

Our server was great. Hope she moves on to a restaurant where she can actually make money."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant near the airport and the Hilton Garden Inn. Excellent cocktails and the tater tots with cheddar are a bit too tasty. I enjoyed my dinner. Attentive wait staff and comfortable atmosphere."}
{"text":"I have been here several times. I have been here for dinner and lunch and also for family doings where we have rented out the rooms for parties. The service is not always perfect but I believe they try there best. This last visit we thought the lady at the door was not welcoming and was rude. But we did not say nothing and brushed it aside. We enjoyed our meal on this somewhat busy Saturday night so we did not take time into consideration  about waiting because we know it can be busy. The couple behind us could say other wise. But overall it was a good experience and I am sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible!  Service bad, food worse, stay away!  One of worst restaurants have ever been to in Cleveland.  Mothers Day brunch - epic fail!"}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a good brunch with ENDLESS mimosas ?! I've always heard about their brunch so I decided to have my birthday brunch here. The brunch buffet is a little pricey but it is worth it.  I was not disappointed. There was a large variety eggs, potatoes, biscuits, French toast, fresh salmon, crab, seafood gumbo, pastas and a lot of other stuff. You can get sliders made to order. A waffle station and made-to-order omletes. All included in the buffet. By the end of the brunch were were all stuffed and a little tipsy from the mimosas."}
{"text":"A very old school kind of establishment. Feels like it has been here since the 50's, which is perfectly fine. A very nostalgic kind of atmosphere.  I came for lunch with a client and friend, and my pot roast was fantastic.  The service was lacking and a bit slow. The server also took a long time to bring the check, but service will vary person to person of course, and I think he was new.  I very much enjoyed the large fireplace with sitting area.  In addition it is incredibly close to the airport with plenty of parking as that might work for many travelers, and it is a great spot for a quick meeting.  I would definitely return."}
{"text":"100th Bomb Group is an absolutely fascinating and unique restaurant. The main dining hall is themed as a World War II mess hall, and that theming spills over to the entire restaurant space and grounds as well. There are miniature planes on the tables, a full-sized Jeep out front, and much more. The food was tasty, though a little pricey for the location it's in. The service was fine, but nothing to particularly write home about. I will say that the mess hall theming would make it a good place for groups. Overall, I'd say that this would be a fun lunch spot to check out, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for dinner unless you're prepared to pay a little more than usual."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a whim. Started off with a couple of cocktails ($11 each!) that were quite good - Cucumber Gin Cooler, and Spiced Whiskey Sour. Both were excellent.

Couldn't resist the loaded tater tots ($8) to start. They were very good, hot, and crispy. Price is definitely on the high side. Would have liked to have had something other than plain sour cream served with them, especially at that price.

Wife had the steak salad ($16). It was large, but again, price point was too high for what was received. Somewhere around $12 would be a better value. She also had the beer cheese soup and deemed it excellent!

I went with the prime rib ($16, is this a theme?). Beef was generous, and thankfully, sliced correctly. The au jus was good, but could have used just a bit more. Came with fries that were definitely not made in-house.

Dessert was creme brulee, and was very good. They rotate their desserts around, so there is no actual menu of them.

Place is cavernous, but clean. The staff is very nice, and well trained. Our server Bree was awesome!

And hey if nothing else, how can you go wrong with a place that uses retired fighter planes as wind vanes?"}
{"text":"I work at the airport and have been here too many times to count.  The lunch menu hadn't changed for many years so I literally have tried everything they had to offer at lunch.  Everything was always good, made to order, high quality, and at a great price.  I haven't been in a while and it looks like they have finally mixed lunch up a bit.  I'm glad to hear but it also looks a bit pricier.  There are some exciting options now so I can't wait to go back to try them.  There are some that remain, like the Turkey Croissant.  That is one of my favorites, along with the California Chicken Wrap.  The soups and salads haven't changed much and they are a bit more interesting than your standard choices and very satisfying.  I've also attended a wedding shower here, and got to experience their amazing, over the top brunch buffet.  This is what dreams are made of.  They had 4, maybe 5 rooms, filled with choices from soups and sandwiches to sushi and crab claws, made-to-order omelets, and a pasta bar.  So many breakfast and lunch choices, you're going to need to make a few trips.  I believe the price was around $36, which is a lot for one person, but the quality and variety of what they offer is worth it!  They party was in one of their party rooms and had an entrance to the outside patio that overlooks the airport.  It was really nice and a little something out of the ordinary.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Back thirty years ago when this series of restaurants opened, it was neat to go with your parents and grandparents who would get nostalgic about World War II.  Well, the French countryside motif and WWII memorabilia remain, but the food and service have left the building.  We went for Sunday Brunch.  The staff was unattentive, unprofessional and rude.  We had to ask for drink refills and got the wrong check at the end of the meal.  The breakfast offerings were OK.  If you want ketchup on your potatoes, be ready to get it from packets, no bottles here.  The raw bar has unpeeled shrimp and the crab legs are wimpy even by NE Ohio standards.  The dinner entrees are pretty standard.  The custom made omelets and pasta were nothing special, and prepare to wait.  We had to wait over five minutes for the chef to show up.  The desserts were sweet and plentiful.  Would not recommend, at least for brunch.  You can do better."}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant today. food was good and service excellent. Price-WOW!!!!! I went for brunch with a friend. My bil was $31.95. Really? I never get my money's worth out of a buffet, but that price is outrageous. I have been there before it was $20.00 that I could deal with. Food is not worth the price. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best.  If Red Lobster is your pinnacle of taste, then you may enjoy it.  The lunches we've had there over the years, however - as a favor to my elderly Dad - were consistenly sub-Olive Garden in quality.   

Its really a shame that the follow-through on the WWII era decor was so impressive and yet they care so little about the quality of food.   Also they are not exactly attracting the most gung-ho wait staff.   Its all a bit sad, really.

Finally, if anyone gives this place a 4 or 5 star review, you should be very, very suspect."}
{"text":"Help, this place really needs it such a beautiful place . I have not been here for so many years and was excited when we decided to have our company Christmas lunch here. We have been going to Pier W for the last 5 years and wanted to try something different. There were 15 of us and All agreed we would not be back. I want so bad to give them a good review, the  atmosphere is wonderful but from the front door staff not being friendly to our ho hum waitress to the food I just can't .  We went on a Thursday afternoon so it was not overly crowded so what occurred was just lack of oversite on the management and chef. Three ordered the California chicken wrap and each one was made different , not one had  guacamole two didn't have bacon  and the third just a few pieces of diced chicken no bacon or tomatoes. I could not believe when she opened the wrap it really was just all lettuce.  I ordered the apple and kale salad and I added a piece of chicken and thankfully I did. When our server set it down I thought I ordered a side salad by mistake. The bowl was as wide as my knife so about nine inches with a 1.5 rim around it so about 7 inches wide for the salad. The piece of chicken on top was wider than the greens in the bowl.  I have to say the salad was very good and I enjoyed it but 21 dollars for a side salad With chicken and a cup of coffee.  I would be writing a much different review for my salad if the salad would have been larger or the price significantly lower. The three California wraps were all sent back with one choosing not to eat at all. They did correct two except for the guac they said they were out. Our entire order consisted of the California chicken  wrap, shrimp pasta, pot roast, apple kale salad, Caesar salad and the 100th Cheeseburger. The only ones that liked the meal was myself with the kale salad though way over priced and the cheeseburger.  I am so sorry but someone needs to fix this. I am always very hesitant to write a bad review but it is necessary here.  My wife and I will be taking a trip soon and told her  let's go to Bomb group before we fly out for lunch so
We don't have to get the overpriced airport food. I called her after our meal and we have changed our plans .  The atmosphere with the fireplaces and seating is very nice but I would avoid for lunch. Maybe dinner is better."}
{"text":"I went to this lovely restaurant last night with my two young kids and it was the best experience I've had in a long time. The kids were so enamored with watching the airplanes that it wasn't stressful at all. My food was amazing, I got the beer cheese soup, filet minion, mashed potatoes and the upside down apple walnut dessert. I especially loved the soup. My kids got the sundae for dessert and it was served beautifully and they loved it as well. The service was to notch. I will definitely go here again. I will definitely recommend to any and all. Even the decorating was great. There was actually a WW2 torpedo hanging from the ceiling. Both my kids thought that was \"the coolest thing ever.\" There were WW2 airplanes and humviis outside. There was a fireplace inside. Lots and lots of memorabilia from WW2. Amazing restaurant, amazing experience!"}
{"text":"We love this place for group brunches. There are 5 couples in our group & 100th Bomb Group can satisfy everyone - even our picky eaters!

This week we celebrated a birthday & Kelly took the time to bring us some off menu ice cream for the birthday boy. 

Dane & Robin's table service was great too.  Thanks everyone for a great brunch."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is for the Prime Rib. Came here for a wedding and the staff was clueless and sent us to the reception room instead of the ceremony and were very rude."}
{"text":"We went for our anniversary and while the service was great, the food was mediocre. For the price you pay for the meals, the food should taste better. The famous beer cheese soup was tasteless and it used to be a favorite. I sent it back which they took off the bill and apologized.
It used to be better, we first went there 8 years ago and had a phenomenal experience. So much so we had our wedding reception there and had an amazing experience. 
I will say again our servers were great and we still enjoyed the atmosphere. We just wish the food lived up to the ambiance and cost."}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times and have always been very happy with the service and food.  Unfortunately, it appears things are going downhill.  We walked up the steps to the upper bar, where two gentleman were working.  Both ignored us for several minutes, until we asked for service.  At that point we were told that the bar was closed and was being set up for a wedding reception.  Why didn't they tell us that when we first appeared?  So, we went back downstairs, went in the front door and asked if the lower patio was open and could we sit out there.  The hostess did not answer our question, but simply asked if we had reservations.  It was 4:45 p.m. and we told her no.  When she took us to the patio, there were only two tables occupied.  She sat us in the sun.  We took an umbrella from another table and placed it so we were in the shade.  We ordered the mozzarella cheese bites, which we too salty to eat.   Our server was very pleasant and we had no problem with her service.  The other employees appeared to be miserable and were taking that out on the customers.  And, of course, there was the food.  Highly disappointing experience."}
{"text":"If possible, I'd give 2.5 stars. 

Was here for mother's day brunch, which they serve until 2:30pm. Website says about $30 a person, but prices are higher for holidays, mother's day included. Do you know how much? Let me just give you a heads up- $40 is the price. They do NOT mention this on their website, and I think that's kind of wrong. We were deceived and believed it was going to be $30 per person. For that reason alone, I bump them down to 2 stars.

Food was just ok. They have an array of seafood- crab legs (which were very skinny and small, btw), cocktail shrimp, some sort of whole fish, smoked salmon. No cream cheese for smoked salmon...huh? 

They also have a line of hot dishes, everything from eggs, sausage, potatoes & veggies, to beef tips in some sort of sauce. They also have a meat table for prime rib and pork tenderloin. The prime rib was great- perfectly cooked and flavorful. 

I was disappointed that there was smoked salmon but nothing to eat it with. The fruit was very good, super sweet. The rest of the dishes that I tried were just ok. Desserts were plentiful. I'm sure they don't make all of those in house. There were simply way too many of them... I suspect they order all of this stuff from Sysco across the street? Hmmmm..anyway, I found they weren't worth eating. 

We were sat in the largest room by the window. Problem was, I had my seat next to a post...and I felt pretty claustrophobic and didn't have enough space. Kinda hard to cut your meats when you have a hard wall right next to your elbow (can you picture that?). I realize that the idea is so you can watch planes take off with the nice view of the window, but from where I was sitting, I couldn't see a thing. 

Service was just ok. Nothing to rave about. 

All in all, at first I was thinking this is a decent buffet for 30 a pop. But for 40, it's overpriced. 
The venue itself is beautiful, but I don't think I'll return."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant. The ambiance with the fireplace in the bar area was nice.  After being sat, bread and water were delivered promptly.  Ordered the french onion soup (which was ok) but extremely hot.  Had to wait 10 minutes for it too cool off or else third degree burns would have happened.  Since I had to wait so long, i only had a few minutes to finish the soup before the pot roast dinner was delivered.  The pot roast was prepared well along with the mashed potatoes and vegetables.  A better timing of when the food was delivered would have been a better experience.  I felt I was being rushed, even-though the bar area was completely empty on a Saturday evening.  While there, the restaurant seemed to have a large group party right outside of the bar.  Acting very loud and bothersome to the other patrons in the restaurant.  That said, the view of the Cleveland airport runways were cool, but after twenty minutes, darkness had set-in and I could see nothing other than the runway/airport lights in the distance and no planes taking off.  Seemed a bit pricey for the quality of the food delivered.  If in the area, nice place to visit but for those having to drive a longer distance, might look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Came here with a few members of the Facebook group Bernese Friends Worldwide (closed group) for a meetup with a member visiting from Australia. We were about 15 dogs and 16 people. The Bernese Mountain Dog is not a small dog! On average they are 100 pounds. Nick LaPolla (General Manager) made us feel very welcomed! They setup a large table on the patio and even placed water buckets for the dogs. Nick's mother (Eve LaPolla) even brought gifts for the dogs! So, it was a wonderful place for this event. Now, the food. We had the Sunday buffet brunch. We took turns holding each other's dogs so we could get food. The wait staff did all they could to help accommodate us with the dogs too. The buffet was well stocked with LOTS of selections including smoked salmon, baked salmon, shrimp, snow crab legs and the associated condiments. Some breads and cheeses as well. Then there were probably a dozen or more hot dishes and a carving station with pork loin and roast beef.In addition, there were also small plates of hot food at the grill/bar area. Then, desserts! Wow, so many different choices. All-in-all, a very nice spread. Great selections for brunch. Recommended."}
{"text":"Place uses to be great. Staff is barely friendly, service is slow, food is not great and I think that says it all."}

{"text":"Mother's Day Brunch! Personal friendly service, historic abeyance, extended menu that delivers flavorful food!  Asparagus cooked & seasoned to perfection. Oh yea photo booth was fun This is a tradition"}

{"text":"I was at the the 100 Bomb Group for Sunday Brunch with my sister who was visiting from out of town and the food along with servers was outstanding. We both had the Prime Rib and that was out of this world.
You cant improve on perfection. I think that my sister and I have found a
new tradition in the restaurant scene in Cleveland, Ohio."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a business trip after a very long day.  Very cool WWII decor and theme.  Food was simple comfort food, we mostly split appetizers, and had soups and salads.  The Ohio veggie salad had all very fresh ingredients and the house dressing was a week balanced vinaigrette.  Perogies and risotto balls were also very good.  Both soups looked and smelled delicious but no one would share.  My only two recommendations would be a broader beer selection and for the mushroom risotto balls to have more mushrooms to balance the red sauce.


Most importantly I would like to commend our waitress Jessica for her professionalism and friendliness.  Especially considering the table next to its had some of the rudest, most disrespectful, and demanding patrons I have ever had the misfortune to dine near.  Throughout their maltreatment Jessica was still able to quickly and efficiently wait on us.  Despite her obvious rough night she was still able to thank is on the way out with a smile.  I felt the need to post this so her manager can commend her on the excellent service."}
{"text":"The food was bland and I or my wife never salt our food while eating out but we did here.  My salmon was ok, I've had better and I've had worse. The bread was a nice sourdough and the Caesar salad was good. The service was good."}
{"text":"The food, service & atmosphere were outstanding! The double pork chops were spot on with the hand mashed potatoes. The decor, WWII jeeps, planes, etc... Was very interesting! Loved reading about some history before & after dinner."}
{"text":"Great view and great food. Got the flank steak and calamari and both were awesome. Perfect for date night."}
{"text":"went for happy hour.......sat out on the patio, which faces the airport, where you can watch the planes take-off and land....it's really a great outdoor space.  happy hour cocktail list is limited, but good and well made. happy hour appetizer menu has a decent selection of inexpensive nibbling choices. the slider were truly delicious, we ordered another 2 plates because they were so good!! you get 3 of them, which are topped with cheese, pickle and grilled onions.  the calamari appeared to be hand breaded, tasty and served with marinara (i didn't like the marinara sauce tasted too canned. the tuna tower was a rare grilled piece of ahi tuna, stacked with sliced tomato and topped with a white sauce that tasted like ranch dressing. i think it would have been better served with either a wasabi dressing or peanut sauce. regardless, the tuna was good.....i'd go back for happy hour. i hear that they have a good brunch. but i would recommend this place for happy hour for outside or inside drinking and snacking.........."}
{"text":"Good day for a brunch. Although the service was a little off today; the food was okay no pier w, it will work for a quick. It's to eat."}
{"text":"Service is horrible.  I am sitting right now at my table of 14.  It took us 40 minutes just to get our drink order.  We are now 95 minutes into dinner - table is full of empty drinks - we are passing time by lighting all the candles - and there is no sign of our food.  The place is far from full (only about 20% full).  First and last time here.

Now 2.5 hours into the meal.  Most were cold.  The desserts are so hard that you need a steak knife to cut the brownies.  Time to head to a pizza shop.  2 dinners - $100 - and disappointed."}
{"text":"Perfect patio with a terrific view but the service here has never failed to disappoint. An hour and a half for an appetizer? Several people in our group of 10 ( yes, we called ahead)) cancelled their order and left after getting tired of waiting. Our waitress disappeared halfway through our meal and none of the otherwise overworked staff knew-- or cared-- what happened. Flustered manager offered a well rehearsed, curt and lackluster apology while preemptively letting us know that she was not authorized to offer us a free round while we waited . (We didn't ask but evidently everyone who had to wait an inordinate amount of time did ask and she had a canned speech ready.) .  I come here once a year or so and nothing has changed, a negative reflection on the management. It's kind of a shame considering the potential that this place has. Sigh. Maybe I'll try again next year to see if anything changed."}
{"text":"Took the family for the Thanksgiving buffet this year. Not impressed and will not go again.  It has been many years since I've been there, but there obviously been a decline.  It was $40 pp for what what I can gather from the other comments, the same buffet every week.

All I have to say is this:  On Thanksgiving, if you're going to serve pressed turkey... just don't even bother. I could not believe it when I saw it. 

Service:  The bus girl was the most personable person I ran into while at the place. Had to flag the waitress down for everything. Spoon to stir our coffee. The bill. My mother was not happy!

It was depressing and I was embarrassed that I brought my family there to the point that next weekend I'm having 'Thanksgiving Redux' at home to make up for it."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night.  It may be the worst dining experience I have ever had. We both were brought the wrong beers and had to flag down two employees to get attention.  Our waitress said that mine was what I ordered and then scurried away.  No water was offered at any point and my beer was gross.  Parched, I waited for our meals.  FIFTY minutes after ordering they came.  My medium well done burger was like a rock.  Again I had to ask two workers to get me mayo and mustard.  Ten minutes later, slathering them on my now cold burger did not help.  I was only able to choke down a few bites.  Nothing was asked about 80% of my meal being unfinished. My boyfriends chicken parmigiana was mediocre at best.  The waitress came over at the end to try to butter us up for her tip.  The table next to us has some issues as well.  I could hear the waitress telling her manager about their complaints. Those conversations should not happen in front of guests.  We were offered a complimentary cheesecake. We declined.  The waitress then said she would like to get my beer taken off the bill.  I told her it would take longer than paying for it and I would prefer to leave.  She then said she hoped we enjoyed our meals.  My boyfriend said his was okay.  I couldn't make eye contact or respond, I was fearful of what may come out of my mouth.  The whole experience was so bad that alerting a manager to the situation was less of an option as to escaping.    I was disappointed to say the least.  We were looking forward to seeing the memorabilia and trying this place finally.  At one point 45 minutes in we tried to find someone to pay for our drinks and leave and couldn't find anyone."}
{"text":"Went to the 100th Bomb Group Restaurant today with my family (yeah I was in town to go!) to celebrate Mother's Day. They put on a nice buffet with many different dishes. I am not usually much of a buffet fan but the food served here was fresh and more importantly, hot when served (and not overcooked!)

The crab legs were fresh and plentiful; the smoked salmon was tasty; the wait staff was friendly and attentive.

Normally I write longer reviews, but I am walking away from the table full, content, and in need of a nap."}
{"text":"Here for a party...the company is great but I could say a lot is lacking as to the h'ors d'ouvres and waitservice.  The room is nice as far as banquet rooms go, pretty standard and nothing special.  The bartender is nice, cocktails and drinks standard price (cash bar in this instance).  Food is nothing special at all, for as much as my friend says this was, I am annoyed on her behalf.  It's cheap bar fare, and not tasty at all.  The server is also very unprofessional, taking stacks of very dirty, saucy plates away without a tray.  Another persons dirty napkin (paper) dropped onto our table; the server just left it there.  Gross.  
The view isn't too exciting.  This place needs much better food and some training for the staff."}
{"text":"I went with my family to the bomb group for Christmas dinner.  This used to be one if Cleveland's gems - USED to be.  Our experience was:  sloooowww service, burnt out light over our table -  awful food service quality food (have you ever heard of de-veining shrimp) and a wait staff that only stopped by on rare occasion to take away plates.  

The lowlights of this sad Christmas dinner were:
- A salad station with wilted lettuce and some disgusting vats of goo they tried to pawn off as dressing
- Meatless crab legs on dirty ice
- Peel and eat shrimp that had only been partially deveined (yuck)
- Chaffing dishes full of gravy laden stuff (the little signs with the description of what was supposed to be in the trays were erased so it was a buffet of mainly mystery foods)
-A carving station of undercooked beef and rubbery ham
- A waitress who after 20 minutes came to take our drink order and when I asked for a Dortmunder Draft she said \"what's that\".  After asking her to just go ask the bartender for one she left it on the bar (fortunately I could see the bar from my dark corner table) for 15 minutes - so I went and delivered it and my wife's wine to our table by myself.

They even tried to charge us $40 for an 11 year old vegetarian's meal that consisted of potatoes, a single glass of water and a Jolly Rancher.  The crack staff in the buffet area couldn't point us in the direction of any vegetarian items other than the lettuce and bread - nice.  

Overall - this place was a massive disappointment - this will be our last visit to the Bomb Group.  Sorry Cleveland - the bomb group has officially bombed."}
{"text":"Went here for Mother's day brunch 2015.  The food was excellent,  particularly the snow crab legs,  cocktail shrimp,  and prime rib.   The service was excellent also.   It seemed like there were 3-4 people checking in on us.  Thanks to the 100th Bomb Group for a great dining experience."}
{"text":"After having a less than perfect visit at 100th Bomb, I was invited back on them for them to get it right. I was very impressed by how well I was taken care of and how much better my meal was. My initial visit was for lunch and the service was slow and the meal dry, bland and lacking. This time I headed in for dinner and it was much better.

My husband, daughter and I headed in and were seated right by the windows with a great view of the planes. My husband ordered the trip of sliders and really liked the burger with the onion jam. The bread service was good with a whipped butter. My Caesar salad was good as the salad dressing had a great flavor.

I ordered the filet which was accompanied by green beans and mashed potatoes. My husband ordered the fish and chips. We both really liked the potatoes .

For dessert, I ordered the blondie brownie. It was accidentally served with cinnamon ice cream instead of vanilla, but it worked and was tasty. My husband ordered the chocolate lava cake and really enjoyed it.

Definitely will come back especially in the summer for patio dining."}
{"text":"I think this year we finally learned our lesson about going out to eat on Mother's Day. Last year's Mother's Day brunch wasn't very good (not at this establishment) and this year's Mother's Day brunch was even worse. I picked this place because I got pretty good recommendations from acquaintances, however upon actually going there and seeing it for ourselves it was a disappointment. We got seated by the window which was great because that's what I requested so the meal started off good! Then we didn't get greeted by a server till we flagged down a woman and asked her who our server was. So this is where the day starts going down hill. 

They had a large buffet offering of all types of variations from breakfast foods to oysters, pastas, and so on. I grew frustrated because nothing had a sign so you had look in every container to see what it is. The one thing that actually had a sign was wrong. The sign said Caprese Salad but it was really a salad with little baby shrimp. Unless there are different variations of Caprese Salad that I don't know about then that was wrong. We got some mussels, crab legs, oysters and shrimp. For a buffet these are awesome offerings however, this place needs to learn how to cook them. Half of the mussels weren't open which means they weren't cooked long enough. And the ones that were open were rubber and yellow/black inside. How can you serve food like that? Do you want your guests to get sick? Would you serve that kind of food to your family or eat that yourself? Probably not. So why waste so much amazing seafood because you either don't know how to cook it or you just don't care to give your guests what they paid for. The crab legs looked great till you went to open them and they were soaked in water with nothing in them once you had them open. Again, wasted expensive seafood. The beef that was served was still basically mooing on the plate. We asked our server if she would eat the beef or the seafood that was on the plate and she said no.

It just kills me to think how much expensive and amazing seafood was wasted yesterday at this establishment because the cook either didn't know how to cook it correctly or the cook truly didn't care. If you can't do a good job of offering  many different choices then offer less but make it amazing.  

Our server was great, she did a really good job of taking care of us she knew we were all frustrated. Good thing there was unlimited Bloody Mary's and Champagne because that's about the only thing I enjoyed. It's just very upsetting to pay over $200 and to truly dislike almost everything. I was so excited to try this place, been wanting to go here for years but after this experience I won't return."}
{"text":"Went there on Valentine Day. Menu was limited which I understand because of day but the food was horrible my wife order a meal with scampi's on the side they were the size of medium shrimp, We order 2 mix drinks each and the bill was over 250.00 dollars. I don't personally plan on ever returning never have done this before so as far writing a review but this was really rough."}
{"text":"I attended a group event here with about 80 people, and it was fantastic. The service was great and everyone was polite. 

We ate buffet-style, and everything was delicious, from the fruit and vegetables, to the rich mashed potatoes and chicken. The carrot cake was amazing - moist and the perfect amount of sweet. 

The views of the airport are cool too, if you're into watching planes take off."}
{"text":"The evening started out with a bartender who came to the table to take our order. He was coughing and didn't seem like he had any server training at all. The food was decent, not amazing. The view was great. One cocktail at happy hour, one coke, we both had a steak, Green beans and mashed potatoes. $100 including tip. I wish I could say something more about it but, nothing great here."}
{"text":"We just had our third annual staff Christmas party there. To say we were underwhelmed, is an understatement. 

The food was mediocre at best. Barely warm, overcooked steaks, limp salads, frozen desserts, and lackluster service. For the prices, it was absolutely disappointing.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"I've only ever been here for lunch.  It good.  The food is predictable.  The wait staff is attentive.  The hostess, however, need to pay a bit more attention to their customers."}
{"text":"This will be the only useful review about this place.

Some people complain hard core after 1 experience with a bad server or something they didn't like.

Some people love a specific food a place serves, and post ridiculously great reviews ignoring anything bad.

My reviews are objective.  

Do you like watching airplanes take off and land? Do you like airplanes? Do you like war pictues? Do you like firplaces and stone? Do you like large buildings? Do you like a cozy booth for 4? Do you like windows the have an airport view? Do you drive a Jeep? Answer yes to two of those questions and  you will love the atmosphere. Did I ask if you like airplanes?

Prices are probably a bit high for the quality of food, but you need to remember you are paying for a lot of over head.  Where else can you sit and watch an airport and have a good meal?  Try the roof in the summer!

I'm sure service has been poor  at times, and I bet it's amazing at other times. I've never had an issue.

Is the place clean? Yes.

Great for a first date, family or friends that just flew in to visit, business lunch, drinks outside on a summer day or night.

If you are looking for a deal, don't go here, clip out a coupon and head to Applebee's instead.   I'm not suggesting the food is is like Applebee's.  It way better.  But don't expect a 7.99 steak.

If you are looking for something new to try you can't go wrong here. 

Be objective my friends!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times to dine in the restaurant or bar area and probably would give those experiences 3 stars. Food was decent, staff was so-so. But I was just in a wedding party here this past weekend that also had the ceremony on the patio as well, so this review is more directed at their catering/party services. 

There is no bridal suite for the groomsmen. They just have to find somewhere to hang out. The ladies have a bridal suite with one outlet that is clearly a converted storage closet with no air conditioning and can comfortably hold maybe 4 people at the very most. 

The event coordinator was MIA for the majority of the room setup and start of the event, the most crucial time she was needed. 

After the ceremony there was a cocktail hour on the patio. Normally a cocktail hour would have a bar, but guest had to go inside to get drinks. The cocktail hour hor dourves were good but there were two food tables set up apart from one another. They only set up plates and napkins on one table. So you had to go back and forth between the tables. Just extremely poor planning by the event staff. 

Prior to the event the staff was specifically asked to move the cake table, located in the middle of the dance floor, as soon as the couple cut the cake and sat down. They didn't. So it sat there, blocking the bride and groom, while all the toasts/speeches/blessing were done. Food service began soon thereafter and the salad and breads were good. The salmon dish was good the prime rib was extremely fatty but was decent. 

Bar service ended 30 minutes prior to the end of reception but they never made a last call announcement. They just closed and put everything away. This is just unacceptable. 

We were then told they ran out of to-go boxes for the extra cupcakes at the end of the night when we were packing things up to head out. 

All in all, this experience was very disappointing. I recommended this place to the bride and groom and will not make that recommendation ever again."}
{"text":"I stopped in with a coworker before a flight home. I'd driven by before and always thought the vintage military equipment out front looked great. 

The place is huge and a bit more formal than I expected. The menu was a little pricy with steaks, seafood, etc. I went with a burger which they describe as \"cooked perfectly\". Challenge accepted. I ordered it medium but unfortunately there wasn't even a hint of pink. It was decent, not entirely dried out, but not quite worth $16. The fries were pretty good.

The military decor is fascinating and the service was solid but the food was just good and not quite worth the price."}
{"text":"I like to swagger my way, in my gucci outfit from the plane, to the city where LeBron once played. I kid, I lie, there's no swaggerness in me even if I tried. It's only me, my jeans, transformer t-shirt, and cool sunglasses dying to break out of the prison called a plane.  

I try to hype myself up into trying the best restaurants in Cleveland. But once off the plane, tired, and not looking forward to my 1.5 hour drive to the middle of nowhere, a restaurant near the airport looks so much more pleasing. 

So the Shining meets the military decor concept. Interesting it's definitely a one of a kind. With warm early fall, brings great opportunity to enjoy the splendid outdoor patio seating. Oh the beautiful view of highway, airport, and plane landing, it just can't be any more romantic. 

Food, eh it's mediocre. 3rd time in my life where I actually had to send back my steak because med-rare equated to super well done. Service was splendid on the other hand. Only time where a waitress insisted that it was fine to send back my food. Bonus star for her hospitality."}
{"text":"Mark called and offered my son and I a complimentary Sunday buffet.  The food was very tasty and got to watch the Browns game.   I offer 2 suggestions: This past Sunday was one of the most beautiful of the year, so why would all the outside areas be closed?  Open the patio and let us enjoy the weather and see the airplanes.  The music was a bit blah too, I remember when they used to have airport tower talk in the background.  This was something very unique to 100th Bomb Group.  

Thank you very much for making up the bad experience, we will be back again."}
{"text":"10 min wait for table.  They got my co-worker's order wrong.  Nice view of the planes taking off and landing."}
{"text":"Service was slow, but friendly. Food was OK. I came in for something light so I ordered a wedge salad and the Parmesan risotto. The salad needed more vegetables besides the lettuce, and the risotto was still hard. The ambience is cool but definitely needs some updating. 

This is a place I would maybe bring my grandma, but never an outing with my friends."}
{"text":"Cool restaurant...the old planes and vehicles were a nice touch.  Food was good, I had a huge tasty burger for lunch... it's what you would expect from a $6 burger (lol). Have to say that the hostess was the mostess...very friendly and cheery. A little pricey for lunch but still worth it."}
{"text":"This 3-star review is a combination of my experiences at 100th Bomb Group. I've been there several times for dinner, lunch, special events, and the brunch buffet, and found the food to be delicious, the service great, and the overall ambience and theme to be pleasant and thorough. All in all, a 4-star experience. 

However, today, I came with a group of 12 for Mother's Day brunch. We had 1pm reservations and a half hour wait. The food we has from the buffet was all fresh and delicious, but the same as any other weekend. We just had to pay higher prices for the long wait, overcrowded dining room, dishes that were running out and slow to be replenished, literal dishes that run out---one member of our party just balanced a few cream puffs in the palm of her hand because there were no more plates to be found. Basically, they just couldn't keep up with the sizable crowd and our experience was sub-par because of it. A pretty disappointing experience for a day we all wanted to be extra special for the moms in the group."}
