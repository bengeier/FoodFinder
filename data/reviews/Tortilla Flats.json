{"text":"Why do I do this to myself? When you see clues or get a feeling, go for it and leave, just leave. 

My first clue should have been when I asked the server if these were the tacos that I ordered (it wasn't until I started digging around my plate that I was able to locate the creamy chicken tacos) Ok, Creamy chicken tacos should have been my first clue. 

One of the other people that I was with described her fish tacos as soft tacos stuffed with fish fingers......

After a great day or hanging out, our entire party had to cut our visit short and jump into cabs to head home after eating here."}
{"text":"I love Mexican restaurants but the margaritas here were absolutely disgusting and the food mediocre. The ice in my margarita was melted when it came, there was no salt, and it tasted like watered down syrup. The service was also really poor. Most of my friends were displeased with their meals. The fajitas were substantial, at the least. But I will not go back."}
{"text":"The Good: 

Location, patio and the 'Stiff Slap' cocktail. 

The Bad:

The Service (slow, rude and they don't know their menu)

Cleanliness (the table was sticky, the menu was sticky and if you get lucky enough to sit right beside the kitchen, you'll see that it is FILTHY!)
 
I've only been there for drinks and apps, so I can't comment on the food entirely, but from the apps I've had, they were blah at best."}
{"text":"Just had a social with TPMG at Torilla Flats last week, the experience was not great - the food has really taken a huge dive there.  I go for the boneless chicken wings, which were good the first time I had them years ago, and the last two times, were horrible - overfried ickyness.  My friends experienced the same with Calamari which was rubbery.  The pepsi wasn't great either.... watered down, or not mixed properly with the carbon.  As chef Ramsey would say .... this place has lost \"the passion\"."}
{"text":"Sub-par food.  Draft beer not nearly cold enough.  Sugary, syrupy, melted daquiris with little or no alcohol, we couldn't even drink these.  Service horrible.  Nuff said.

Just go to Java across the street, at least you will be charged fair prices for decent food. Better patio too."}
{"text":"I went here for food a while ago. Big mistake!
Ordered some typical chicken wraps, nothing complicated. First thing I noticed was how quick the food came out while it was quite busy. Definitely seemed like ding ding microwave fast. 

Taste was bland and awful. I didn't think anyone could mess up a chicken wrap, but I was wrong. My friend had similar feelings and a stomach that started to cramp. Luckily my cramps didn't start until after we left. 

We left a large amount of food on the plate, obviously. The waitress came over and said: \"Finished?\". She then picked up the plates full of food and ran off as quickly as she could. She was trying to avoid having to listen to a complaint. Which shows me she's expecting one every time someone finishes their meal. It made her an expert in dodging criticism. Well done! That's the way to improve your quality!

One of the worst places in town. Never go there for food. I would have rather gone to the nasty KFC across the street. That says it all.....I hope."}
{"text":"The Toronto Lover system:
5 stars = Must visit!
4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here.
3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go.
2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary.
1 star = Do not visit!


What's good about Tortilla Flats? There's a lot of seating, it's in a neat part of town, and they have drink and food specials. There's a patio in the back, but it really lacks in any flavour, ambience, or creativity. It's like a backyard party at your aunt's house.

That's about it. There's really no reason to visit. If you're at Queen and Augusta, you were on your way somewhere else anyway.

2 stars"}
{"text":"Came here for drinks during Nuit Blanche - vodka tonic was SO weak and bartender was just ok. There were barely anyone at the bar and we had to wait for almost 10 mins to get our order. So after that I went for some tequila shots... but when I asked for some lime and he used his bare hands to give me 5 limes at once, that was it. I know how dirty some bars/ restaurants can be, but that just looked downright gross. 

Back patio was cute, but overall the restaurant just looked very uninspiring. Will prob not go back again."}
{"text":"I can see all the hate people have for this place. Now I can admit the food sucks, but if you want cheap drinks.  Go for it. What else do you expect from 3 dollar tequila shots? Patio is quaint.  Chill. It served my purpose which was have shots and forget the stress of my shitty life. Cheers! Take that life! !!!"}
{"text":"Grungy, oddly lit, messy presentation, sloppy, but a satisfying, greasy plate of food.  I catagorize this place as a \"so bad, it's good\" establishment.  It's like that horrible movie you can't help but watching and kinda feel ashamed that you like it.

Is it the best tex-mex out there?  No.  But the serving sizes are huge and there's the perfect level of greasy goodness.  Just watch where you sit."}
{"text":"Cool patio, but it's rarely filled at night. They have some good deals, like $2.99 daquiris on Mondays and $2.99 margaritas on Thurs, but they're so syrupy and sugary you can't taste any alcohol. And so filling (and again, sugary) you can hardly drink more than 2 without feeling like you want to keel over. 
Food-wise, the only thing they're good for is their nachos. The wing sauce tasted like water"}
{"text":"came here only for the $3 tequila 

nothing special, but I do intend on coming here for food one day because as i walked in it smelled AMAZING"}
{"text":"1. If you want Mexican food, I strongly do not reccomend Tortilla Flats

2. Do you like Mcdonalds? You'll love it here.

3. Frozen guacamole, my Mexican grandma is turning in her grave

4. NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"Food Quality & Price: A great bar and grill!  I really enjoyed the Tex-Mex part of the menu.  I ordered the Fish Tacos ($11.99) but comes with a salad.  However, the waitress had no issue accommodating my substitution of mexican rice, sour cream and beans instead of the salad (some of the other entrees came with that but the fish tacos originally, did not).  The quality of the fish tacos were very good, but the rice and beans were just superb. 

Facility: Located on Queen West, a great place to stop for brunch/lunch if you're doing some shopping in the area. Cozy decor with a giant drink menu on a chalk board. Ambiance is nice, was not loud or quiet.  GOOD music (rock). Washrooms are typical of downtown washrooms, cramped, needs more maintenance, tap water is freezing cold so leaves me to wonder if hygiene is an issue. There is patio seating available.

Service: Good, friendly service but INCREDIBLY slow with both the kitchen staff and the wait staff. Food took a long time to get out to us and the server took a long while to bring us the bill, 

Overall: I felt that Tortilla Flats was a neat discovery for me during the shopping day on Queen West. Very accessible and has a thoughtful menu (with brunch and lunch served until 3pm). I definitely return if I was in the area though there is room for improvement with wait times and washroom cleanliness.

I rate it a 3.5/5 but will be generous because of the great taste in music. =)"}
{"text":"Food is meh and service is pretty bad and.........I LOVE IT!
Tortilla Flats is like that one friend that everyone has, who is a huge asshole. They kinda suck but for some reason you love them. Tortilla Flats is that friend!
Great patio and cheap drinks, can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Service was ok, a little slow. What we weren't a big fan of was the \"automatic gratuity\" which amounted to over  20%, because we were a table of 7. This was automatically added to our bill because \"we were a large group.\" I have no problem tipping 20% when service is great, but tipping is voluntary. It's the right thing to do, and I always tip, but forcing a tip % upon a group just didn't seem right to me, the tip amount is the clients decision based on the service. We were also not notified of this before ordering."}
{"text":"generally dirty. holes in the seats were covered up by electrical tape. straws have orange guck on them. ironically I  enjoyed the steak fajitas."}
{"text":"Yikes. 
They do have a patio that isn't as busy as most but.....

-Service painfully slow.

-Wrong drinks being brought to wrong tables. 

-Brought out a drink with a dirty straw (mysterious red liquid dripping down it) = no

-Listened to a customer complain to the bartender when we watched a pint of beer poured into a pitcher to top it off \"well I just poured it, two minutes ago!\" \"I'm not paying for that, bra\" = all I needed to experience to confirm I won't be ingesting anything more purchased from Tortilla Flats."}
{"text":"Tortilla flats is a total dive but it has a decent patio. Super cheap drink specials- 9$ 3oz drink specials and 3$ tequila. Beergaritas are always a good time. The foods a bit of a miss, it's all deep fried and not authentic but the Texas fries are really good. Service is generally a bit slow."}
{"text":"This place is somewhere to go before a night out for drinks. They have tequila for $3. I haven't really tired any of their food -- I've only had their nachos. To be honest, I can see what the food looks like on other people's tables and it looks scary -- like something I wouldn't even feed my dogs. I only come here for a cheap drink when I am in the neighbourhood. They have a good atmosphere and a nice outdoor patio in the back for the summer time."}
{"text":"Quick n' easy Tex-Mex is served to your table within moments of ordering, and their margarita specials can't be beat.  The crowd is of the edgy hipster variety mostly, with the odd tourist for good measure.  Make sure you try the curry chicken burrito at least once in your life; it's a staff favourite."}
{"text":"Great late night spot. Servers are attentive. Menu is long. Good Mexican food. Don't expect fancy but simple and good. The chips and choice of four dips- bean,salsa, con queso and guacamole were all very good. I loved the cheddar soup. Creamy with jalapeños and onion. Parking on the street is not great as there is construction on queen street but there is a green p just behind."}
{"text":"It is what it is! You will find everything you need of a sports bar : beer, fully loaded nachos, TV with the Jays game on... on a patio!!! The ambiance is rather chillax and that's perfect for a Thursday or a Friday night with my hubby and/or with friends! It's so conveniently located in queen west so easy for a bar hopping evening too!"}
{"text":"They are famous for margarita specials. I fell for it when I was 19 and now again 20 years later. The margaritas never had more than a hint of booze in them and still dont. The food is pretty not good either."}
{"text":"Great patio and cheap $3 tequila shots and $9.99 3oz cocktails on Fridays. From a drink and patio perspective, the restaurant gets a solid 4 stars. However, we ordered the funky fries and it was probably one of the worse fries dishes I have ever ordered. It was a bunch of fries with diced up tomatoes, green onions and sour cream on top while floating in a plate of watery and translucent cheese sauce.  Not sure if this indicative of all of its dishes, but definitely do not recommend ordering these fries. I would however come back for the drinks."}
{"text":"Definitely a dive bar. My friend and I randomly stumbled into this restaurant and was a little hesitant of going in as it's not our usual style of restaurant. The restaurant for sure has seen better days, everything was sticky and the floors were gross from the years of caked on dirt, grease and what not.

We got seated right away and ordered a pitcher of beer. They have great deal on drinks $9.99 for 3oz drinks which is great in Toronto. We ordered the cheese fries and a platter to share. The con queso on the fries was so watered down and disgusting we didn't end up eating it. The platter was ok though.

I don't think we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"The nachos and frozen margaritas were pretty good. The service was fair but the atmosphere looked like it was run down and desserted. Also had the tequila shots for $3 which were not worth it as they tasted like super cheap tequila that wouldn't do much. Would not recommend those."}
{"text":"Some people hate on tortilla flats but it's basically a Mexican dive bar and you know what you're getting into. There's always a drink special and they give you pretty hefty food portions. I hope tortilla flats sticks around because it's nice to have a Mexican restaurant around that always has a place to sit. 

I went on a Sunday and their drink special was basically a beer ceasar for under $5 and they gave me the rest of the beer to mix in afterwards. I also got their veggie chimichura which was filling. My friend got their rose sangria which I thought was very unique."}
{"text":"The only reason this place is getting two stars from me is their back patio. It's never full and always very comfortable. Unfortunately you cannot write a full review based on seating alone..This is there the goodness ends and the complaints begin.

i went there a few weeks ago for drinks / apps with friends. The service was okay and the food was edible. The drinks (triple cesaers) were quite delicious.. but that's about it.

Last night, I ordered delivery from here.... I ordered at 611pm, at 720pm the driver called to say he was lost (I dont live far and its only one turn from the restaurant) and then another half hour continues to go by, and still nothing. I finally called the restaurant where they told me it was out of their hands and the food left 45 minutes prior (you can imagine how this meal is going to taste). The driver calls again and asks me to walk two blocks to meet him (i did not). 

When he finally arrives he shows me the casing the food comes in and says its warm so my food will be fine.. IT WASNT Fine... I got a taco... it was cold, soggy and the melted cheese had hardened and was cold. So not appetizing. 

Anyways, long story short, waste of money, waste of hunger, waste of time.

Too bad."}
{"text":"Steak fajitas were amazing and so were the lychee drinks. They're hidden with alcohol that will hit you after. Awesome feeling !!"}
{"text":"REAL fruit margaritas! mmm... taste the difference real fruit makes, as opposed to slushy chemical mix.

I highly recommend the raspberry margarita!"}
{"text":"Pros: Margaritas are $3 on Wednesdays, food was filling, decent prices, and open late on a weekday. 

Cons: Bean Soup was really salty, sketchy bathrooms, and awkward seating arrangement. 

Will not be returning"}
{"text":"Mmm.... have a previously mentioned my affection for margaritas? Okay, I love em. So i was just here tonight and to my surprise and delight i discovered Margarita Thursdays for $3.49!! Mmmm..... limey & frosty..... *drool* (very limey btw!)
We also had nachos, pretty good. Could be cheesier. The chips were kinda weak. The sweet potato fries were pretty good. Not to die for, but good. The chipotle mayo was great though!
Oh ya, i almost forgot... um... $3.49 Margaritas Thursdays. Yes."}
{"text":"They get a 3 for nostalgia. I can almost remember coming here when they were across from the Horseshoe, further East on Queen. I say ALMOST because I drank a lot of tequila here in the 90's and the Horseshoe was my go- to after wards.

The patio is a great place to chill and Thursday is Margarita night. A marg for under 4 bucks-- I'm in! They also play kick ass tunes. Sadly, their bar mix is pretty gross--not even the tequila can help it. It's far too sweet but also had this incredibly sour backbite that actually burns my throat. Sorry, guys... but if I'm drinking a Marg, my throat had better be burning from the booze-- not the mix.

The food is pretty gross. But everyone knows that when you're drinking, gross can be just what you want. I do admire their business model, though: Keep your clientele loaded and they'll stick around for food and probably not care what they're eating. Then they can blame their scoots on the booze!

No culinary awards here, but it's a Toronto Institution that I must pay homage to and frequent every once in a while...for old time's sake!"}
{"text":"I've only ever been for Tuesday night Fajita special, but I've been several times.   The servers I've had are friendly and energetic.

I like the portion size of the fajitas and the fact they don't charge extra for guacamole."}
{"text":"Ass.
Food: ass
Washrooms: always assy gross
Even their pop...ordered a coke and it tasted like wood. WTF?"}
{"text":"Nice patio in the summer. Decent magaritas, but not strong. Nachos were pretty good too...but not a place i'd crave to visit"}
{"text":"I came here about 5-6 years ago (I think, it was a LONG time ago!) and everything was delicious...

This time, everything was absolutely disgusting. Even the diet coke was totally flat. I mean not a single bubble in the glass - not one. What the hell. Anyway...

Ordered the enchilada. It was filled with soggy, overcooked chicken that tasted like it was canned. Somehow the enchilada itself was totally undercooked. The cheese was barely melted. The rice was a soggy overcooked mess too, barely touched my food. Yuck. The guacamole was alright, I guess. Should have gotten nachos but something tells me all the food sucks here. My friend was pretty disgusted with his quesadilla too. 

I'm never, ever coming back. Ever. Shudder.
Avoid, avoid, AVOID!!!!"}
{"text":"Looking for a light lunch that didn't start in the high double digits, we finally found Tortilla Flats.

The place was dark and not very welcoming, with a jumble of tables and chairs which you wind through to get to the \"Please Wait to be seated\" sign. Kind of superfelous, since we were the only customers in the place.

A lone bartender was visible and after a pause came to seat us.  We opted for the outdoor seating which was brighter.

A lack-lustre waitress showed up with menus, after a while.

As suggested by the name, the food choices were mainly Tex-Mex.  My partner chose the Huevos Rancheros  and I had the Chicken Caesar Wrap.

When the food eventually arrived (pretty sure they had to go to the farm to get the chicken and the eggs), it was generous proportions and quite tasty.

So dark and dingy inside, lousy service, cluttered tables which interfere with entry and exit, but decent food and moderate prices.

Would we go back? Only if we were on Queen Street and starving and couldn't find a better spot. Unfortunately, what drove us there in the first place was the lack of reasonable eatery choices in that section of Queen.  We think that restaurants are charging outrageous prices ($13.00 for a BLT) because they CAN; because it's a trendy area. (I suppose we could have gone to KFC or Subway ... but we don't feel either one serves actual food.)"}
{"text":"Way better than warehouse on queen street! The food is decent and the drinks are super cheap! 

3 ounce Texas cocktail for under $10.00, $3.50 margaritas on Thursdays and $3.00 tequila shots all week! 

The place is a bit run down and dirty looking inside but the patio is really nice! Have eat their many times without any complaints and always had good service."}
{"text":"went there with few friends and greatly enjoyed the food, atmosphere and cheerful staff!

we were there on wednesday which is a beer special day - all domestic for $3.25 I think. 

the portions are HUGE! not on the cheap end but totally reasonable prices. 

it felt that we were very welcomed there and that's the best thing about any place you go to!

good variety for vegetarians too.

Not a five star just because the menu could have been cheaper. but I'm definitely coming back for a deep fried ice cream which just didn't fit into me after I finished my main dish (the name of which escapes my mind)"}
{"text":"Oh Tortilla Flats. I've been coming here for more than 10 years, back when it was in the old location east of Spadina. I have a million and a half memories here and probably still have their weekly specials saved in my brain somewhere.

We came here again and enjoyed their $3.50 margaritas which as usual were delicious, but not particularly potent. The service is always friendly and pretty quick and the atmosphere is always comfortable.  They have a great patio that is possibly open all year round.

Beware the stairs to the bathroom, depending how many carafes of booze you drink, you'll be needing to use them a lot, while less and less able to do it safely."}
{"text":"If you want to listen to contemporary R&B and rap music while you enjoy your Tex-Mex, this is the place for you, Jim."}
{"text":"I like the Flats.  I've been a Flats fan for 10 years.  It is what it is.  A dive-y Tex-Mex restaurant with cheap drinks right in the heart of Queen West.  Come here to get loaded and eat saucy carbs.  What else would you come for?"}
{"text":"BAD SERVICE went to this place tonight even though many times in the past I've had a mediocre meal and poor service.  Tonight however 6 of us showed up, we saw two friends and they came to sit with us.  At the end of the night however we asked our waitress, who always seemed to come to us with a chip on her shoulder, if we could all have separate bills.  This would have netted her a bigger tip and allowed us to pay with our cards, however we were handed a bill that included the two that joined and were told that because there were 8 of us we now had to pay one bill with a added 18% (above 15% average).  Now one person had to cover the card while the others scrounged for cash, also those who thought the service and or food sucked were forced to pay a 18% tip.  If it were up to me we would have just left enough money to cover the price of the dinner/drinks and left.  This poor service will insure that I will never return, nor will the others with me, and I will make sure to tell as many as I can.  Poor service and bad policy equal lost business period.  Its a shame, but even in 2015 businesses take advantage of their customers thinking that poor customer service will still win the game.   My suggestion to those who read this, is avoid this place and enjoy one of the other many places on Queen West that will earn your business, rather then feel entitled to it.  1 out of 5 my worst yelp review yet."}
{"text":"Tortilla Flats is consistent, I'll give it that. 

I've been here many times over the years. The fact that it has managed to stay in business and to keep it's chill atmosphere and relaxed menu in the otherwise completely refaced and now very \"Eaton Centre\" Queen West is pretty awesome. 

I used to love Queen West for the cute boutiques and interesting restaurants that they don't have in the suburbs next to movie theatres and that don't sell gift cards which work at 5 other restaurants owned by the same company. Now it's all H & M and Payless Shoes and a few restaurants remain in tact. 

Tortilla Flats offers an extensive menu with awesome (and incredibly quickly made, piping hot) nachos to whet your appetite which includes three different types of chili, lots of vegetarian friendly options and my favourite, the dry Cajun boneless wings. 

Things come out sizzling hot (real sizzle lines appear over this review if you read it with 3D glasses) and they have a really interesting dessert menu which includes other sizzling food items, but sweet ones. Fountain drinks are replenished frequently. 

The staff are usually relaxed and fun and the atmosphere is usually a bit loud (especially if you go on one of the better drink feature nights- they have one every night of the week, some better than others) but there's good background music a la satellite radio and of course, the always fun people watching on Queen West through the abundant windows. 

Gripes, yes I have a couple. 

Firstly, they have never, in all these years, joined the interac world. They don't take it. They have an ATM on site which charges an arm and a leg to withdraw money. They do take credit cards, though. 

Also, this place now (since the Smoke-Free Ontario Act) houses a massive back patio which is packed with drinkers in the summer and littered with smokers all parka'd out in the winter. The problem is that it would appear the patio was thrown together when the Act was passed because.....gasp.....you can't eat without smoking......and the seals and insulation just never were paid the attention they were due. So in the winter, this place is effing cold. I wore my coat the entire time I was there, even while eating spicy food. 

And the bathrooms are sickening. But that seems to be the case everywhere I go, whether that be a 24 hour Tim Horton's or Ultra Supper Club. Some people are just gross. 

The Tex-Mex here is good but my heart remains resident at La Cabana on the Danforth."}
{"text":"I really love this place. The prices are decent, their strawberry daiquiri is alright, a little too sweet. Other drinks I've had there have been good though. Their tacos are amazing and all the servers I've encountered have been very nice and gave great service, even though when their patio has been packed!"}
{"text":"If you have an iota of respect for yourself, you will not attend this place.

This was the worst dining experience I have had in a long time. The only good thing about this place is the fact that my friends and I will, from this point forward, institute a pre-food consumption assessment when on-site at any bar, restaurant, etc. The assessment is as follows:

1. Check out the washrooms. If it smells like you have entered the depths of hell and looks like it has never been cleaned, do not eat there. This should be a no-brainer, but sometimes you give a place the benefit of the doubt. You might think, hey... maybe someone was just in here and they were having some \"difficulties\". Or, hmm.. this might be a one-off thing. NO! Rid yourself of these thoughts, if the bathroom is nasty, it is a clear indication that they dgaf about their guests. Leave immediately. If the washroom is clean, stay and complete step 2.

2. If step one is passed, order a beverage. If said beverage is of poor quality, do not order anything else. Pay for the drink and roll-out. Find another place and repeat the assessment.

Back to the general review.

The nachos were sub-par. For a tex-mex restaurant, you would expect the nachos to not be something a 7 year old with no imagination would make. The taste was fine, but the toppings left a lot to be desired. I had a pint of Dos Equis, which was of the uretic variety, but it was my fault for ordering a shitty beer. The pina colada my friend ordered looked like a pathetic watery mess of bargain barrel juices; apparently it tasted as bad as it looked.

For my main, I ordered the chimichanga. I have only had this dish once in my life. I resolved to never have one EVER again because it was beyond amazing and felt like it should be a once in a life time experience. Unfortunately, I chose to order it and let me tell you, that was not a chimichanga! It was pretty horrible. There were maybe 6 small pieces of unseasoned chicken and the cheese tasted like no-name cheese that had been sitting in a freezer for years. Luckily, it was so unlike a chimichanga that it did not mar my view of them.

My friend order the quesadilla and hated it (no surprise). She had two bites, realized it was bad and made it known to the server. The server was not very accommodating and the manager was just as bad from what I could hear.


Will not be back."}
{"text":"Tortilla Flats has great drink specials and a huge and beautiful back patio. I've eaten here a couple of times and never been overly impressed with the food but it's a great place to get a drink and soak up the sun after a hard day's work. 

Also, the servers here have always been very friendly. I went here for a friend's birthday and we split the nachos (which for a Mexican restaurant you think would you been better). I also tried that ridiculous brownie thing (in lieu of birthday cake) and again, I can't say it was too darn tasty. But for some cheap drinks and good times, Tortilla Flats is a good Queen West spot to hit up."}
{"text":"This place serves decent Tex-Mex food. 

I've been here twice now, once for the enchiladas and once for the chimichangas. While both were good, I apparently have yet to try their most popular menu items - the burritos, fish tacos, and Texas cocktails. 

The prices here are quite cheap, with most Tex-Mex dishes coming out to $9-12. My order came with rice, refried beans, sour cream, and a tomato. These extras were very generic and quite bland, especially the rice. The enchiladas and chimichangas themselves, though, were very good. 

After hearing that I haven't even had the best of what they have to offer, I guess I'll have to go back."}
{"text":"This place was great.  My boyfriend took me here after HOURS of walking, and man was it delicious!  The beer was super cheap, the food was reasonably priced.  Service was OK, not the best, but it wasn't like they weren't there.  I had to call for their attention a couple times.  I ordered some sort of salad, I don't remember what it was called, but HOLY CRAP.  It was HUGE, and soo good.  It came with a zesty/spicy dressing on the side, but was so much better with ranch dressing.  Nothing too spectacular, but nothing terrible either. Bathrooms are in the basement and are very cramped, but not too gross.  I'll definitely go again."}
{"text":"Tortilla Flats is a bit of a let down.  You go in with high expectations because some combination of the fun name, the cool back patio and maybe something you heard from a friend of a friend leads you to believe it'll be fun.

Unfortunately my experiences there haven't been overwhelmingly positive.  The beer was warm and the food was mediocre.  The service wasn't bad, but it wasn't good enough to make up for the other things.

The patio is nice, and if you're looking for a good patio, I'd say this one isn't bad.  Of course, that means you need to be ok with warm beer.  Being inside the restaurant is nothing special.  In fact, being inside just makes you wish you were outside on the patio.  This place is a poor substitute for Java House which can be found across the street."}
{"text":"The last time I walked into Tortilla flats was about 8 years ago when I was 18/19 and was denied to sit on the patio because only people 12 and older were allowed..i was well over the age limit but okay! 8 years on me and my sister decided to give this place another shot. 

Given its been so many years youd think the place would look better than their fancy new sign outside but it was still very run down and dusty. Upon entering for lunch the bartender was doing both the bartending and serving as he was the only one there. We waited a good 5 minutes before he came back around to ask what we wanted to drink. He then decided to go grab us some menus. The menus were in a plastic covering that smelled like they were wiped down with a dirty rag. 

I ordered the chicken bbq sandwich which said came with sweet potato fries. My sister got the pulled pork sandwich w. Fries. We both got two cokes which was beyond flat!!!

My meal arrived with regular fries instead of sweet potato fries..server never came vack to check on us so I just ate them and they were the only good thing about the dish. The chicken was white meat which was nice but was smothered in what tasted like diana sauce and sandwiched inbetween a regular hamburger bun? The bartenders friend was also there so he was paying more attention to telling the kitchen cook to make sure his friend got a large nachos and chicken and it was made well. 

We finished our meal in which the bartender came back with our bill. There was no extra talk or great service from this establishment. The food was very mediocre and this seems like the type of spot to go for drinks as they seemed to have good drink specials. If you want authentic mexican food..do not come here..in fact if you want any food do not come here.

I am surprised this spot is still around. Maybe it was a one off but this was one off that will never have me return."}
{"text":"A friend of mine got me hooked on this restaraunt. It has amazing margaritas (3 bucks on thursdays!). I loove the Mango one, my new fave.The food is also very good. I absolutely love the chicken chimichangas and the mexican rice is very good. However, their deserts leave something to be desired, I got the brownie pie desert and it wasn't as amazing as it sounded. I still go there for the food and the awesome drinks! A Queen Street Must!"}
{"text":"I have a long history with Tortilla Flats, one that began on a warm early summer night almost six years ago and developed into a longterm relationship with consistently decent tex mex food. I headed there last night with intentions of jaunting down memory lane, so I ordered things that reminded me of the early days: 3oz cocktails (texas teas for me please), 2-4-1 fajitas (the Tuesday special! This place has great specials FYI) and criss cross fries. It was all amazing!

Tortilla Flats continues to score well in my books not because it has a gorgeous interior (it doesn't...it's actually in need of some TLC, though this is part of its charm) and not because the food is great (though I've never hated it, especially the avocado salad which holds a dear spot in my heart), but because it's a place for texas teas and margaritas on the lovely back patio, a meeting place for friends, and a spot for entertaining (and always great!) service. 

The people are nice, the food is good and the drinks are generous and creative! I love mango margaritas on thursdays ($3.50) and cheap sangria pitchers on sundays ($11, I believe). It's not overtly expensive either. All in all, I always recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Tortilla Flats is hit or miss. I have had great experiences there and completely terrible ones where I left feeling and being sick. But I keep coming back so that must say something.
The cheap drinks are definitely a bonus, but it's also one of the few sit down Mexican restaurants within walking distance of all of the downtown clubs and bars. It's a great place to start your night off with cheap drinks. The patio is nice. The music is good and the wait staff is always friendly.
If you are in for a good time. Tortilla Flats is the place to be just don't have high expectations."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic, drinks too.  Service was atrocious...we showed up as a group and were told that because there's more then 6 of us they would not separate the bill. The server, a red head with glasses was extremely rude and not the least bit attentive. She made no attempt to make us feel welcome, or help us understand our bill at the end, which we all believe was wrong and over charged. On top of that a group of 6 or more is automatically charged an 18% gratuity.  She did not deserve 18% of the burrito farts I'm gonna have later. Just terrible. Would not recommend to anyone, in fact I will be sure to make a point of telling people not to come here."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn`t already been said?

If you have never gone to this place and wondered about it - go!

I went after work with a co-worker for a drink and you know what, I enjoyed it!  It`s a very chill atmosphere.  It`s not about being pretentious here. not at all. It`s about kicking back, having and a drink and enjoying some inexpensive and filling food.

What makes me want to go back besides those things listed is-  the customer service.  

Now, I haven`t tried the washrooms yet and to be honest I`m a little afraid from all the reviews so .... um...i give it 3 stars!"}
{"text":"I KNOW THIS HAS BEEN HERE A WHILE.
Nothing has ever enticed me to go in there - but one Sunday, after failed attempt at yoga and in need to enjoy that rare sunshine we get - we got here. THERE IS A BACK PATIO - which was just about the only selling point. Out waitress was super nice - except she checked on the bill a million times, but really awesome waitress and nice cook patio.

I am not as impressed about the food.
It came ON the aluminum plate-thingie. NO paper in between, just because - oh I dunno , unsanitary reasons? I'm sure hey clean it but you know....icky. It was small - but that forced both of us to eat slower and pick at it. I love nachos but, Dog's Ballock's have spoiled me - this one just seemed to be MISSING stuff - like ...jalapenos  - and not enough cheese(but really, there is never enough cheese).

And the waiter - clad in  jeans with mysterious stuff spilt and dried all over - \"cleaned\" the table with 2 napkins (you know the kind you get at Timmies?) by drawing a Z on the table. there was stuff still ON the table - i had to open up a napkin before resting my elbows and it was stuck on the table later on....

I like the selection of Sangria though - i LOVE THE ROSE Sangria. It was lite, fizzy and fruity. It was beautiful.

I would come back again, if there is no other patio open and the Rose sangria."}
{"text":"This place does not make a great first impression. It's on the corner, across the street from a Taco Bell. Walking inside, I wasn't sure which restaurant would have better food. Since it was a warm summer night, we sat outside on the back patio, which was good because the place is a dive inside.
There used to be a Tortilla Flats in the 90s across the street and a block or so east of this location. I was hoping the new Tortilla Flats would be as good as the old one was. It was not.
The cheddar jalapeño soup had no cheddar in it. It tasted like a corn soup. It was okay, but it wasn't a cheddar soup; but it did come in a tortilla bowl, which was nice. 
I had chicken enchiladas for the main course. Again, as was the theme for the night, it was okay, but nothing special. There was some sort of weird thick creamy sauce with the chicken that was sort of like a bechamel sauce. 
My husband got the chimichanga, which was tiny. However, to be fair, both chicken dishes had real, big chunks of chicken breast.
We ordered the funnel cake churros for dessert. They were definitely the highlight of our meal. 
So this place is a solid meh. It wasn't the worst Mexican restaurant I've ever been to, but it was nowhere near the best either. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Just got back from Tortilla Flats.

Writing this with a bit of a buzz on. Why? Because the booze is cheap. 

Oh, and yeah, the food is good too. Friendly service, reasonable prices. 

Nice back patio. Great for a summer afternoon/evening."}
{"text":"Not the best Mexican by a long shot, but decent for a few things, including chili and taco salad."}
{"text":"The homemade chicken curry is definitely not made in a traditional curry sauce. The curry sauce tasted too milky and did not have the appropriate flavoring. Also, the guacamole had what tasted like mayonnaise in it.  Finally when I went to use my Canadian money to pay, the waitress brought out a money bag and was trying to determine the change table side. At that point I decided to just pay by credit card.

The server was nice, but the restaurant still has much room for improvement."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night because every where else was packed on queen street.

After checking out the menu I was pleasantly surprised how cheap the food was. The drinks were really reasonable.

I ordered a marguerita on the rocks with an additional $3 shot.

For food I had the tacos, one chicken and one spicy beef.

The verdict: drink was great, food unfortunately not very good. The chicken taco filling looked like cream of chicken soup and the spicy beef was just terrible.

I hate giving bad reviews, but it just wasn't all that great. Ill be back though to enjoy the taste drinks."}
{"text":"Using TODrinksWeekly to find some Monday night specials, I picked up the missus from work and we headed here for some $12 pitchers and some dinner. 

Should have gone elsewhere...

First off, the beer wasn't very cold with rinsed but warm pint glasses. Fine, it's cheap and the budget is working against me so I can accept the average pints.

It's definitely a well-used restaurant with crappy furniture and a couple TVs that were way past their best before dates.

I ordered the Po'boy with rice, the missus went with the taco salad. Both items were cheap, and offered a choice of steak or chicken at no extra charge.  

My Po'boy was simply terrible. They obviously used either frozen or stale bread and microwaved it for my order, but microwaving so long that the bottom half was chewy and incredibly hard.  I dumped the bread's contents in with my rice and finished it off that way. It was tasteless, but I ate it anyways (why do we do that?!).

The missus said her Taco Salad was \"good\" but didn't finish it. I didn't follow up so I take that as a negative. She did mention that they had visited once recently on lunch break and was shocked that their fajitas didn't include cheese! The missus loves her cheese so this should have been reason enough for me not to drag her there.  Fortunately, I fed her some more warm beer and she forgot that it was my idea. 

In summary, I will not return."}
{"text":"Enticed by a sign outside that said \"Tequilla $3\", we decided to venture inside. After a few tequilla shots and sangria, I got hungry and ordered funky fries. When it arrived it looked like a Taco Bell fries supreme. It was fries with melted cheese that had the same viscosity as creamy mushroom soup, with a very unimpressive dollop of sour cream at the top. The only difference between this and the taco bell version, is that at taco bell you can get a cardboard box with it to go. 


Overall, go for the tequilla and drinks. If you're hungry, don't get the funky fries, however our waitress recommended their Tex Mex fries."}
{"text":"Im so so sad to see you guys go! I loved this place so much. Super underrated restaurant but thats what i loved about it. The nachos were to die for and the $3 tequila shots were everything. Thank you guys for always providing the best service!! Ugh im hoping you guys come back!"}
{"text":"It is what it is. I wanted some hot wings and they delivered.  The wings were reasonably priced as it was 1/2 price Mondays. The hot wings are hot, not \"hot.\" No need for the suicide side.

The 3oz cocktails were only $10. Not bad for the T-dot.

My wife had the fish tacos. She thought they were really good. Balanced, not too oily or fishy.

Our server was a ginger, but he was really good."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant in Toronto. If you want a warm Margarita or beer go here. 
Also expect your bill to be combined with whoever your sitting near. 
This is the first place I've felt obligated to not leave any tip. 
If nobody enjoys or consumes anything they've ordered wouldn't a substitute or replacement be offered?"}
{"text":"I really liked my lunch out on the patio here. I have only been once, but with a group of 6 and we all enjoyed it. I do agree that the main attractions here are the drinks and the patio. The patio is awesome - don't bother going here on a rainy day. I wouldn't dine indoors - its kind of dark and dull. 

One person in my party commented on there being too much cheese and sauce in her burrito - not enough filling. Someone else commented that their enchiladas were very rich. But, everyone ate up and seemed to enjoy the meal. I had a salad - which was amped up with a big tortilla bowl and chicken, guac, cheese, all the toppings. It was a monster salad and very fresh. 

Everything was pretty cheap - I'll be back for the Wednesday or Thursday night specials."}
{"text":"Was out shopping with my sister-in-law on Queen Street and we were meeting up with my husband for lunch and decided on this place. 

I don't have a lot to say about this place. There were very few people dining there at the time (maybe that should have told us something about this place). So it was pretty quite all around. Our server was a pleasant guy, but nothing special about him. 

The food here was just a bit blah. It was edible, but did not have a whole lot of flavour.

With all the food choices in on Queen Street, and in the downtown core in general, I probably won't be stopping here for lunch again."}
{"text":"Just absolutely the worst and rudest service in the neighbourhood. What more can you say about lazy workers, rude customer service and lack of participation with the greater community and neighbourhood as a whole. 

It's probably about time they call it a night and let someone more committed to the serving of local and visiting guests."}
{"text":"I could see how this could be a good patio to enjoy some drinks on but, the drink I had, a lemon/lime margarita tasted like Pledge furniture polish. The calamari appetizer was the one thing I truly enjoyed, the seasoned batter was delicious and so was the jalapeno mayo. The main was flautas and they were mediocre. The side of retried beans however were the worse I've ever had. All in all I can't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Before Larissa and I saw Banana Boys this evening, we had supper nearby at Tortilla Flats.

Larissa ordered fish tacos with a Caesar salad.  She said the tacos were just okay.   The batter wasn't as light as she had expected and she said the oil they fish had been cooked in didn't seem fresh.

I ordered a chicken burrito (without lettuce, cheese and green peppers).  It was okay.

Jordan was our server.  She was friendly and took good care of us."}
{"text":"It's a dive bar. The food is good junk food with daily drink specials. The portions are large. The drinks are okay. I find them a little sugar-y for my taste. But I love the fish tacos after a late night. It's not the cleanest. but that's not what you're looking for. 

It knows what it is, and I would have given it 4 stars except the customer service is poor. It seems to get better at night. One time, we went in recently with a big group around 3-5pm, and told them way beforehand if they would do separate checks. Even though the place wasn't busy, they refused."}
{"text":"Absolutely the WORST Mexican restaurant that I've even been to in Toronto. Really nothing positive to say here. The food is bland, stale, and obviously reheated. Avoid it."}
{"text":"A very average TexMex experience but it does have a nice patio at the back and is in a good location for the queen street folk.

Portions are average, and the food is okay.  I personally enjoy the lattice fries... but that's normally becasue i'm good and drunk by the time i hit this place and am looking for some greasy carbs to soak up the booze I've ingested.

The 3 ounce Texas cocktails / girly drinks for 7.95 served in wine carafes which are pretty cool and delicious.  I recommend the Purple Popsicle or Curious George... but you may wanna have dinner somewhere else."}
{"text":"The WORST margaritas I have ever had combined with the rudest bartender I have ever encountered. The food was fine for inexpensive Tex Mex and the waitresses pleasant yet Ryan, the bartender was apparently offended when I asked for a margarita on the rocks, with less \"margarita mix\", his response and attitude were shocking, so much so I asked to speak with a manager directly to complain and was told that he, Ryan, was the manager!  Had I not been with my children, having a beautiful night out on the patio, I would not have stayed. If you are planning on drinking margaritas do NOT waste your time or money here!"}
{"text":"Service was reeeeaalllly bad. Like out waitress was a huge bee with an itch I don't know what she's doing in the service industry. She gives us our menus and asks us if we know what we want to drink, and we took a few seconds to consider and she just walked away without saying anything and disappeared for quite a long time. When she came back, she asked us again and directed the question at me, and I hesitated for like a split second and she pulled the same thing again. Also my meal was not good. Do not go here."}
{"text":"ok this is definitely not the place to try and have a good meal. 

but their drink specials are pretty good . i had thursday margaritas (3.50)-it was pretty weak and a little watery but i started asking for an extra shot of tequila on the side to pour into my drink and that did the trick. the shots were also $3 bucks!

for food we had some beef taquito type thing-tasted like they got it frozen from costco 
we also got cajun fries with nacho toppings. these were pretty good -they had lattice fries which are my fav and you cant go wrong with guac, tomatoes, onions etc. 

i would come back for drinks and their nice patio only."}
{"text":"Wednesday nights has $2.75 domestic bottles (quite a few selections including Mill St.), as well as other cheap drink nights throughout the week including Texas sized drinks, 3oz martinis for $6.

Their patio is respectable seats 50 I would estimate, and is a decent place to socialize.

I have had very little food there, but I have tried the Texas Fries and the Funky Fries. Lets just say those fries are definitely \"funky\". Their con queso looks like it could pass for nuclear waste. Don't get me wrong, this dish is pretty good, and I have had it on a couple of occasions, but make sure you don't set the bar too high for quality and taste.

Although I have never had their fajitas, they do smell damn good when they go by me."}
{"text":"Looking for the worst Tex-Mex ever? Look no further!

I was apprehensive about Tortilla Flats before we even went in, given that I live in the hood and no one has ever recommended it to me, but a few in our group remembered it being decent, so we decided to go for it. 

Ever eat a meal and immediately decide that it wasn't anywhere near worth the calories and wish you could just throw it up and start over? That was our meal at Tortilla Flats. 

It began with a bad margarita loaded with too much bar lime (a peach one that tasted nothing like peach, more like limeade) and ended with everyone moping home, wishing for a Delorean to take us back to five minutes before we made such a terrible dining choice. 

Three of us had burritos. The steak was extremely fatty, flavorless, and probably the worst cut money can buy. There was lettuce in the burrito and sauce on top. The rice was sticky and flavorless, and there was just nothing good about the plate. Another in our group ordered tacos, which were buried under rice and refried beans (something she had asked to be omitted from her plate), and so the hard corn shell became soggy. 

Another friend ordered the chain gang chili, and got vegetarian instead. He waited almost until we were done eating for his proper chili, and seemed not terribly impressed with his dish, or at least didn't hate it as much as the rest of us hated ours. 

I guess having drinks on the patio here would be okay, but I will never again return for food."}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviewers: alcohol is the main, if not the only, reason to come here. The food is pretty terrible. I remember once I had boneless chicken wings and despite the fact that the concept of boneless chicken wings is ridiculous, they were alright. I've been severely let down by their nachos, and fries, and everything else except the booze.

And the booze is great, their margaritas, the corona + lime margarita which I can't remember the name of is AMAZING. The problem is, on cheap night, that you literally can't drink more than two of their huge drinks. Not only because they're huge, but because they're SO sugary and acidic that you may die, or your tongue may fall off. Definitely have beers in between, or just have one, no matter how tempting the $3 price tag is.

All in all, this place is good for drinking, they have a patio that rules in the summer, and it's a fun time. Just stay away from the food."}
{"text":"Is there such a thing as a negative star? Soooo disappointing! Used to come in my college days.. Was busy, good atmosphere.. What happened? Had the fajitas.. Awful! I think it was refried from last night's service. I'd be shocked if I didn't get food poisoning! Never again!"}
{"text":"Not the best Mexican in the city -- that's my friend, Jesus -- but I liked the food more than other yelpers. Week-long booze offerings include cheap beer on Wednesdays and Margaritas on Thursday. Their trellised patio in the back is one of my favourites in the city.

Obligatory Title Pun: The tortillas fall a little FLAT.

Menu Readability: Pretty readable. I wouldn't shoot the dog over it though.

Need to mention: Their website makes Myspace look understated and tasteful. Do check it out.

What this place teaches me about myself: My foreign policy: I'd rather drink Mexican beer than American beer."}
{"text":"WILL NEVER GO TO THIS SHITTY ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN. The manager is absolutely disgusting and has no respect for women. He has terrible problem solving skills and isn't logical at all. The owner is also also warped and takes the defence of the manager and not the customer. They have terrible customer service skills. I saw them yell at one of their staff members while dinning in. Disturbing."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Wide selection of great Tex-Mex fare, and a great spot for a weekday lunch as it's not usually too crowded.  Parking can be a challenge in the area.  The service is friendly, and the food is always delicious.  I find the booths a bit cramped, however."}
{"text":"Alright so I admit it has been a while since I've been to Tortilla Flats, but good times don't fade away fast.  I used to be in and out of Toronto all the time, and Tortilla Flats was an awesome place for dinner and a few drinks, especially on a Tuesday.  Tex-Mex food is hard to get terribly wrong.  I mean get something made of corn and smother it with beans and melted cheese and Tad-DA!  

Plus the mixed drink deals are awesome!!  I never expected 5 star quality food from this place, never got it, but the menu is solid, service is too and prices are really good.  

Of all the times I ate and drank there I remember one negative experience and it had to do with a sucky server, sheet happens.  I'll still go back!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really did. Being from Texas i was hoping to find a decent tex-mex joint here in Toronto. This sadly isn't it. I ordered the chicken tacos, thinking this was about as safe a bet as you could find. The shells were soggy, and the filling was an overly salty but an otherwise flavorless coagulated mess. The beans tasted otherworldly (not in a good way). the only reason im giving 2 stars is the place has amazing drink specials and good service. Thank god for groupon, I didn't wind up having to pay full price. Bottom line, I'll be back, but it'll be up at the bar."}
{"text":"I've stared at my check in for Tortilla Flats for a really long time. I have waffled from one star to five stars for this brightly coloured, crazy-bad-it's-good place. I'm going to play it safe and say they're an A-OK establishment, but I reserve the right to update this review. 

This place has a great back patio in the summer, covered with foliage so it's not too hot and is still breezy. Perfect for sucking back their margarita specials, $3 tequila shots and $12 pitchers. 

Their food is so. not. good. But I don't think that necessarily makes it terrible. Sometimes I want to get drunk with a buddy and then decide to order a sizzling plate of rubber chicken, or cream cheese filled poppers. This is my prerogative. 

PEPPER'S PREROGATIVE: Viva Tortilla Flats!"}
{"text":"Had a taco salad here.  The taco casing was too oily and fragile.  The salad was too bare bones basic.  Iceberg lettuce, tomato, and avocado.  It would've been much better if the salad was more varied and interesting.

Decor is wonderful.  Staff is super friendly (but is there such a thing as a not friendly Canadian?)

My Canadian friends all have nostalgia/fond memories of this place, so perhaps it's more of a drinking / drinking food / hangout kind of place.  I can relate to that.  But I was simply getting lunch, and my taco salad was ... meh."}
