{"text":"Myself and my boyfriend along with a couple of friends decided to check this café out one Sunday afternoon on a beautiful day in Toronto. The place has a real old rustic feel to it, almost like you're standing in your grandma's kitchen. This is achieved by the thick wooden rusty tables and the wooden cabinet littered with books and interesting knickknacks.  The kitchen is an open one with a floral pattern dress wearing chef cooking frantically behind it. We were a bit put off that she wasn't wearing a hair net but let it slide. One thing I liked though was that this place had proper ventilation, so you don't leave smelling like the food as was the case at Mitzi's Café. We also loved that it was hidden in a nice, quiet residential area, always a favorite!    We noticed that there was only one server on duty, which made the service less than impressive, but god bless her she was doing her very best. You couldn't really blame the server for this but instead the management for allowing one server on duty on a busy Sunday afternoon (the place was packed). Once seated we were served water right away and asked about our beverage orders to which we all said we'd have coffee. The coffee was the best damn coffee I've ever had in my life! And I've tried various kinds in my day between living in Europe and here. I even went to the trouble of taking down the name of the brand. As the service was quite slow, we had to re-fill our own coffee cups from the coffee station as well as our own water, which actually made the whole brunch experience more interactive as you almost felt like you were in a friend's kitchen helping yourself.    I ordered the salmon/goat cheese breakfast wrap ($11), while the rest of the table ordered their own choices (all different). I have to comment on the freshly cut Paeonia arrangement in the middle of the table, my friend and I couldn't stop sticking our noses into them. The washroom was quite small but clean. Our meals came out 45 minutes after ordering but were delicious! The goat cheese complimented the salmon extraordinarily well; I was surprised at myself that I've never tried this type of pairing before. The rest of my table also expressed like for their meals. I was a bit disappointed though with the bland salad on the side. Although the leaves were all very rich in color, the dressing was nothing special.  The total bill for the two of us was $35. Even though the service wasn't the best, I would still give this place four stars, for the effort put in by the server in doing her gosh darn best, for the amazing food, for the ambiance and for the general feel of the place.   A definite place to return to, but perhaps a bit earlier next time."}
{"text":"Luna Cafe is now one of my favourite hidden gems for brunch!   I went this weekend with a friend and we were able to be seated right away. I had the poached eggs with mushroom and she had the poached eggs with smoked salmon and we were both blown away! That in the combination with the home fries and arugula salad was the perfect balance for brunch.   They also had an assortment of freshly squeezed juices that go great with the meal. Not to mention the coziness of the restaurant on a cold winter day created a perfect atmosphere!   Since it is a smaller restaurant, if you come for later brunch like we did (1ish), you shouldn't have a problem getting seated right away!"}
{"text":"The food here is always delightful. A great little spot off the beaten path. Really great for meetings, brunch and solo visits any day of the week."}
{"text":"Great food. A little pricey and the portions are awfully small, but knowing that the ingredients are organic helps. The smoked salmon Benedict is amazing."}
{"text":"my husband and i are new to toronto. we moved here a month or so again and are on the search for a great brunch place. we've had plenty of so-so meals, but nothing as good as luna.   luna is very small, quaint, mom & pop feel, and charming atmosphere. it is not on a main street, which adds to it's individuality and charm. they have a few tables outside when the weather is nice.   the food was delicious. excellent coffee and smoothie. the menu is limited but you'll understand why when you see their kitchen. and it's impressive to think the food served was so good. there was only one waitress, which made service slow, but it was actually refreshing not being rushed and it forced us to slow down. you have to know going there it won't be a quick eat. i will definitely be back, even to get a drink to go."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food. I didn't have to wait long for a table at all - although the location was small and it is clearly a go to spot for Sunday brunch. Awesome flavors and timely service. And all the while The Rolling Stones were playing. It doesn't get better than that!"}
{"text":"Nice quiet intimate cafe. Not overly busy on a Saturday morning. Coffee was good. I had the peameal bacon and poached egg on english muffin with chipotle hollandaise. Tasted pretty good.   My gf had the pancakes with caramelized fruit. It looked good. Their portion sizes are good. Not small but not big enough where you are leaving stuff on your plate.  The staff were friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Had the salmon eggs Benedict which was very good. The hollandaise wasn't so overpowering and it was very light. Really enjoy the atmosphere of the place and the staff. Recommended to anyone who likes a cozy place to have breakfast."}
{"text":"Luna is great little neighbourhood spot for weekend brunch.   Poached eggs are always perfectly cooked and come with interesting flavour combinations: avocado and gruyere with chipotle hollandaise; smoked salmon with dill hollandaise; wild mushroom with chive hollandaise; and the Alpha Omega (smoked salmon, avocado, capers, dill, salad). Scrambled egg breakfast wraps are also really delicious.   There is usually a short wait for tables and service can be a little slow. Wouldn't recommend going if you're in a hurry. Coffee and tea selection is great, so take your time and enjoy it."}
{"text":"Dear Wishing Well,  To think my mother said the 35 cents was a waste... it did what four simple words and a tap of the feet could not. My wish was for a leisurely brunch, nestled in the heart of Toronto's Art & Design district, with a vibe that Dorothy herself would appreciate. Enter Luna. Although I haven't spotted any of the staff with red slippers, they could surely pull it off.  The coffee cups are small (cute), and the coffee is abundant. Paired with a nice omelet, and some natural sunlight (season depending) the passing of time becomes a treasured occurrence.  I am still not certain if it was the great service, home cooked creations, or semi-hidden location, but something made me feel like there is no place like home (Luna).   Sincerely yours,"}
{"text":"Cute little place on a primarily residential section of dovercourt. Small patio out front that has lots of trees for company. I ate some of breakfast burrito that was quite yummy. Service was average, which means I had to ask twice for a few things and waited ages both to order and to get the bill, but the server was pleasant enough."}
{"text":"Great, cozy, neighbourhood cafe with simple but delicious food that is responsibly sourced. These tiny spots in residential areas have a way of making you feel comfortable. It's almost a little escape from the city  I usually have the Frenchman's Breakfast - brie, sausage, eggs, baguette, greens. Everything is so tasty, the brie is amazing on a the lightly toasted baguette and the sausage is savory and not too fatty. My better half usually gets the Alpha Omega which she loves being GF and dairy intolerant - has salmon, poached eggs, avocado, capers.  Their bottomless drip coffee is a nice roast.  Note that the menu is different on the weekend - mostly a variety of eggs benedict. I actually prefer the weekday menu, it has more variety. It gets busy on the weekends, but no worse (probably better) than everywhere else. Nice little outdoor patio during warmer months. You'd expect it to pretty hipster given the location and vibes, but it's not quite trendy enough (which works for me).  Good for: 2 person brunch; eating responsibly, taking your mom out!  GF options - yes, they occasionally bake their own GF bread (I'm told it's good) Dairy free options - yep"}
{"text":"This place is great. Takes only debit and cash. The food was great very inventive and yummy.  Reason for 1 star: hygiene. The cooks don't practice proper hand washing procedures.  Neither does the cashier. She was handling money on minute and taking ice out of a bag with her bare hands the next.  I sadly realized all this after I started eating. Bummer, I had high hopes."}
{"text":"Came in here with my boyfriend looking to grab a few sandwiches to go, as we had a busy day ahead. Waitress said the food would take about 15 minutes. No problem. Well by 15 minutes I guess she meant 30 minutes! The restaurant was by no means busy and there were 4 people working in that small kitchen. Sandwiches were good. But not 30 minute wait good. The side salad had to be the most bland I've ever had. And how could u be so oblivious to your slow speed!? 30 minutes for 2 sandwiches is ridiculous. I even told the server that we didn't have enough time to dine in. If the she has been honest about wait times we would have just come back on another day when we had more time. I don't mind waiting if I'm not in a rush. Definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"We have lived in our place for 10 years and never have visited Luna, a restaurant which resides in the space of an old variety store on Dovercourt. Today we decided to walk up and give it a try.  I love how the owners left the old signage of the variety store on it's windows. It is a small place and at first look at the menu, know that they are dedicated to free range and organic. originally I arrive just to have bacon and eggs, but could not find that on their limited brunch menu. Yes, the menu is small but everything we saw that went to other tables looked delicious!  I decided on Free range poached eggs, on an English muffin along with free range peameal bacon, with chipolte hollandaise. It also came with potatoes and a green salad. Teena chose buttermilk pancake with warm seasonal fruit and organic yogurt   Mine was fabulous! Also it was very filling. I loved the slight bite of the chipolte in the hollandaise. Not one for having salad with breakfast, I really enjoyed my green salad. Everything on my plate was done to perfection and all that went back was an empty well cleaned off plate.  Teena enjoyed her pancakes and had asked for the yogurt on the side. She was glad she did as didn't really enjoy it with the pancakes. She did clean up everything else.  Trying it for the first time after ten years, I can't wait to go back. Especially when the weather is much nicer to enjoy a great brunch outside on the patio."}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's my kinda cafe. The owner is pretty nice. It's just unfortunate one of the waitresses doesn't realize a smile goes a long way. I swear I have never seen her smile, I feel like I have to spit my order out fast so she doesn't get more pissed than she already seems to be. Aside from her, the place is awesome. They have free run eggs. Breakfast is the bomb and they make a good soup."}
{"text":"Came in for a leisurely coffee on the patio. Excellent Americano and such great service. Though I didn't eat, the menu looks great. Can't wait to come in for breakfast."}
{"text":"Small cozy little restaurant for a nice brunch. The food was fresh and you could even see the chef cooking the food which is nice for a change. I ordered the Luna Lyonnaise, the only thing I did not like was the fact that I could not substitute the Arugula for something else. I was even willing to pay the difference, but our server seemed indifferent to this and said no substitutions which kind of annoyed me to be honest. Other then that it was a nice breakfast and somewhere I will go again!"}
{"text":"Disappointed in the service, or should I say lack of service. The waitress was completely indifferent. The salmon scrambler w greens was good. Salad needed seasoning. I only wanted water w my meal but was never asked if I wanted a coffee or anything else after my meal. Which I did. I'd heard their Americano was good. She never even spoke to me again until I was cashing out (with the chef as no bill ever arrived)... asking if I needed a receipt. I refused to leave a tip. I always tip 20% for good service... Nothing for bad."}
{"text":"Luna Café is the definition of a hidden gem.  When I have someone visiting from out of town, food plans with a friend on a budget and/or I just really want a scrumptious, Instagram-worthy brunch, Luna Café is the catchall. It's a hop, skip and a jump from my house, however, even if it wasn't, I would move mountains to dine here.   The space is open and airy, in an old house on Dovercourt across from a beautiful loft building and former bread factory. The staff in and out of the kitchen is entirely female, working away in a small space with ultimate ease. It's never really been a problem to get a table. The patio is super cute, and you do feel like you're in on a secret by eating there. It's in the middle of a neighbourhood, between Queen and Dundas, and yet it feels peaceful and far from the city hustle.   In terms of suggestions on things for you to order, you really can't go wrong. Basically, anything with an egg? The egg is always cooked to perfection and whatever else on the plate will have on point flavours. The avocado will be precisely ripe. The smoked salmon is going to look vibrant and taste just like it supposed to, beside fresh dill. A wild mushroom dish is going to have butter involved- you feel me?   Please taste for yourself! Or don't... because I always want to be able to get a table."}
{"text":"Pretty good. We came here after the wait for Mildred's Temple Kitchen was 1.5 hours (gasp!). we were seated right away. Our food came fast although my bf's complaint was that the portions were a little small. The salad dressing could have used a little more vinaigrette also- it was on the bland side.   Other pros: very reasonably priced. Other cons: they seemed understaffed and the servers were rushing around the place. The menu was also very limited (bennys + wraps + one pancake dish). So if you're a picky eater, you might want to go somewhere else.   Probably wouldn't come back because nothing else on the menu tickled my fancy."}
{"text":"Adorable little cafe. Went here before walking over to the flower market. Ordered the salmon benedict and it was delicious. Service can be a littleeee slow, but its the charm of this type of relaxed place that makes up for it. Outside was full so we opted for inside. It's a tight squeeze at the tables by the windows. There are a couple larger family style tables, but definitely wouldn't recommend bringing a large group. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice and cozy joint for breakfast or brunch! We ordered the poached eggs with smoked salmon and the sausage breakfast wrap, the breakfast wrap was amazing! My favorite, would go back just for the wrap! The goat cheese and the sausage and the red pepper aoli worked together so well and tasted even better! The poached egg Benedict with smoked salmon was like any other, the English muffin was a little tough because I was hard to cut using my butter knife, but still good. For a cute place to eat in Toronto I would recommend Luna cafe!"}
{"text":"This place is a casual, little cafe with limited seating but lots of breakfast options too. Came here on a Friday at noon for a late breakfast. I had the Frenchman's breakfast which was delicious! I love that most portions here come with greens and just the right amount of bread. The portions leave you full but not like you are about to pop!   My boyfriend had the steak and eggs and mentioned the steak was quite bland so if we were to return he definitely won't be having that again.   Side note: the wait for food was not long at all on a Friday! We were quite shocked because we prepared for an hour long wait given the reviews lol."}
{"text":"So delicious and tasty!! My friend lives nearby and we were about to enjoy our warm 5 minute walk here. Great service and the food is so good. I had the smoked salmon and every bite was amazing!  Price-wise a bit higher than normal breakfast, but worth it! Small restaurant so I imagine it can get crowded on weekends. Only a few tables available! We ate and were in and out pretty fast though!"}
{"text":"The food was good. A little busy but service was acceptable. Overall a good place for weekend brunch"}
{"text":"Love this hidden gem !! We went to this small little cafe for brunch.  I had the alpha omega and my boyfriend had the smoked salmon benedict. We also had the passion fruit mango smoothie Food was so tasty and the staff were very nice.  This place runs brunch on weekends from 9 am to 3 pm.. Great place for brunch if u want to sleep in alittle bit on the weekends. Prices were reasonable too, the total for our brunch was about $30 for two brunches and a juice  Must try !!!"}
{"text":"Got into brunch this morning at 11:30 and was pleasantly happy to find street parking close by and no line up at Luna.   They have a small patio so we opted to sit out there as it does get a bit hot inside with the kitchen being in the open space.   The server was very nice and pleasant. Crowd was great for a Sunday morning.   I ordered the Salmon Eggs Benedict and it was delicious! Perfect eggs (I love my yolk runny!) and the English Muffin - actually I'm Pretty sure it was more of a biscuit which is why it was to die for. I ... Hmmm I can't even type this properly cause I'm being teleported back to the texture, it was soft but crispy on the outside and packed with flavour but not annoyingly overpowering. It comes with side of greens and potatoes. Usually I'm disappointed with wedges and potatoes at brunch places but this one made it perfect. How is this possible?   My only caveat is that the food did take long to come out but it's a small operation, the food prep takes time once you see the charm of the place. If you are in a rush think twice but if u are having a lazy Sunday catching up with a bestie - come here!   Price point is typical for down town. 2 eggs Benny and 1 Americans ran us up to $35 before tips.   Will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"This was a lovely brunch spot.. It's tucked right under a beautiful old brick house on dovercourt. There's just a few tables in a small space that looks quite cozy and cafe like. On nice days, they hAve a little patio facing dovercourt which is lovely for brunch. It closes pretty early so it's definitely better for a coffee or breaky. Prices are great seeing that you can get salmon and  eggs or steak for only 11-13 dollars and it comes w a side of toast and salad. It's a nice hardy breakfast to start your day with. The coffee they served was a great brew with it was delicious flavour. It is really small so it probably will be packed on weekends and a bit of a wait. But definitely worth it. Overall it was such a nice, comfortable experience and I'll definitely be back for my caffeine fix or lounging breakfast."}
{"text":"Great brunch, the omega is terrific. But the woman I assume is the owner is quite unpleasant. Otherwise I'd give the full 5 stars."}
{"text":"This review of the Luna Cafe is solely for one wonderful breakfast dish they have on their Saturday/Sunday brunch menu.  This was, perhaps, the loveliest breakfast dish I've had all year and it deserves a shout out.  This is their vegetarian benny-style dish that puts two poached eggs atop arugula greens, rich sauteed mushrooms and onion strings.  Let me tell you, this dish is so much more than the sum of its parts.  The mushrooms are aromatic and toothy (not the watery button mushrooms you see everywhere) and the combination of flavours is just magic.  It was filling enough because of the potatoes that accompany the dish and I left happy but not over-full.  Go order this dish and be merry.  Vegetarian score: 8/10 - the veggie options were one notch higher than the typical brunch fare."}
{"text":"Super delicious. I ordered the eggs and smoked salmon which came with warm, buttered toast and a sizable side salad. The English breakfast tea came in a nice big Asian pot for plentiful refills throughout my meal. Friendly service and free wifi with the password conveniently posted on the wall. I will go to Luna next time I'm in the neighborhood for sure."}
{"text":"This morning, my girlfriend and I tried out the Luna Cafe for the first time. We had walked by this unassuming outfit on a number of occasions and were always curious about what this place was all about.   We arrived at around 10am, and the place was already humming with activity. Luckily, we arrived just in advance of the Saturday morning breakfast rush and were able to secure a table by the door (lucky for me it was a warm day as I was not too bothered by the draft created by the constant flow of traffic through the door). Note: there are only ten tables in the restaurant, with enough capacity for around 30 people, so be prepared to wait if you arrive at a sub-optimal time.   For our meal I chose the buttermilk pancakes with caramelized fruit topped with plain yogurt for $9.75. It was garnished with sprinkled cinnamon and maple syrup. I also had a small fruit smoothie for $3.50.  My girlfriend went with the breakfast wrap with egg, avocado, brie, dill and sun-dried tomato pesto sauce. It came with a side salad with a vinaigrette dressing. It cost around $12.95.  Things  we liked: #1 - the food. Ever have one of those OMG moments when your taste buds first make contact with the food? This was one of them. I polished off my meal in 5 minutes flat. #2 - the bottomless cup of coffee.  #3 - the friendly table service. Our waitress did a splendid job of explaining to us what was available for breakfast and apologized for the long wait for our food. #4 - the decor. I quite enjoyed looking at the old fashioned Pepsi logos and some of the artwork hanging on the walls.  Things we didn't like: #1 - don't wear your Sunday best. One of my pet peeves are the times where you go somewhere that has poor ventilation and you end up taking the smell of the restaurant with you. The Luna Cafe is a small space, and likely hasn't been renovated in many decades, thus upon leaving the cafe we noticed that our clothing had a distinct greasy smell. #2 - on the morning of our visit, the cafe was short staffed (I counted 4 people on staff), thus it took quite some time for our food to arrive. Good thing we were not in a rush.  One thing this place is not, is a short order cafe. #3 - if you are hard of hearing, despite the fact that the cafe is rather small, it got quite noisy, thus it could be quite difficult for the hard of hearing to have an in depth table conversation.  Also noteworthy was the fact that the smoke detector went off for a few seconds (this is something that one would rarely experience in a more professional setting). #4 - they did not have any skim milk available for coffee. #5 - another thing to note is that while we arrived on foot, for those arriving from a fair distance, the only parking option available is street parking. Note that Dovercourt is quite a busy street, so finding a spot on the street may not be that easy.  Given all of the above comments, I am giving the Luna Cafe a 4 star rating, and would recommend this to anyone visiting the Queen & Dovercourt area."}
{"text":"Very nice and cozy place to have your Sunday brunch with close friends. Staff were friendly and cool. Not much space though as you might end up sharing table with cool strangers, but that's part of the experience! The food was really tasty and awesome. The only downside is the poor ventilation; your clothes will be like soaked in cooking oil with the kitchen being in the same room. Overall, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Cute little place hidden away among houses and apartment buildings.  Spacey waitresses that don't remember what you ordered and take forever bringing things to you, but that seemingly felt just right at a place like this.  We didn't mind so much cuz it was such a beautiful day sitting on their patio watching the local residences do their Sunday thing was relaxing.  Food was pretty good.  Ordered the poached eggs on smoked salmon and english muffin with chipotle hollandaise. Served with an arugula side salad.  Nothing really special and I didn't \"mmmmmm\" my first bite, but I wasn't disappointed either.    Coffee could've been better, tasted pretty watered down.  Pretty happy I discovered this place, it's incredibly serene and peaceful all tucked away and all."}
{"text":"New favorite breakfast spot! How have I never come here?  - The food is super delicious - The coffee is great (very important) - The service is quick and friendly - The atmosphere is warm and has an old school vibe to it.  - Close walk from my home if you live in the Queen West area - The patio is lovely to sit on and faces onto a lovely quiet intersection. - The best part about this breakfast spot is that it is completely affordable for the kind of care they put into their food  I would always walk or drive pass this place thinking it was just a cute coffee shop but it is way more than that it. The majority of the food is locally grown or organic, the eggs are free-run, and the breakfast wrap was probably the best combination of ingredients I've ever had.   I will DEFINITELY be coming back again!"}
{"text":"3-3.5 stars.  Went back for brunch yesterday, this time I ordered the Poached egg with avocado and gruyère on egg muffin. And my bf had the smoked trout.   Once I got my food though, there weren't a good amount of home fries (their potatoes). There was maybe just a few pieces. Their poached egg was cooked to perfection, but while trying to cut the egg muffin I realized it was way SO hard to cut. They had it toasted for way too long, so it was a struggle trying to cut it. A bit disappointed since I raved about my first time here. My bf however enjoyed his smoked trout a lot, but complained that there was too much arugula."}
{"text":"After rave reviews from my family, I finally got a chance to try this out and it's amazing! I was expecting a line as I have heard it get busy at 11 but we were seated quickly.   If I had not been with someone who had been there before, I probably would have missed it as it is very unassuming.  I had the Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict and fresh juice. The Hollandaise sauce is a little more acidic than at other places but works so well with the dill and salmon. Perfect portion so you don't feel too full after.  I think I've found a brunch staple."}
{"text":"Perfect brunch restaurant, the menu is to die for. The service was great, and the fact that they offer sustainable food and (i think) fair trade coffee makes it even better. I suggest to avoid going on sundays, since it is their busiest day. Its not a big restaurant so its best to go when the restaurant is not packed to fully enjoy.  I ordered a dish that had two poached eggs on top of an arugula salad. It was amazing, I truly recommend this dish. The eggs were perfectly cooked, the hollandaise tasted great."}
{"text":"Friendly neighborhood breakfast joint. nothing spectacular, juices are pretty sour except the pear ginger. Had the Salmon Benedict, the hollandaise sauce could've had more flavor. Just a regular breakfast."}
{"text":"A lovely restaurant in a very good location. The food is on average... ( I am picky on food) generally a good experience"}
{"text":"As always I start with the vibe and I would describe it as basic hipster meets vintage flea market finds. Nothing wrong with it but also nothing you would post to Pinterest. The place was run by a staff of two. One cooks and one serves. The service was quick and friendly. The menu is broad enough to match most tastes but those looking for a traditional breakfast should look elsewhere. I settled on what was describe as a French breakfast -- two free range eggs, baguette with Brie, organic sausage and greens with a latte on the side. One thing I think a great breakfast place should do right is eggs. If you order over-easy you shouldn't get over-hard which is exactly what I received. It's a small thing but important to get right. The baguette was perfectly toasted and the Brie was fresh and slightly warm - delicious. The sausage was not my favorite but it wasn't a deal breaker. There is a broader brunch menu on the weekend. I'll give this place another chance!"}
{"text":"I really like the granola! We used to go to Luna pretty often since we live in the neighborhood... Unfortunately we have had one too many bad experiences with the service to return. We usually have the same server who seems to hate people and service. She actually chased my boyfriend down to inform us there is no free refills on drip coffee (dumb policy for a neighborhood breakfast joint) instead of letting it slide, he was forced to leave his topped up coffee behind. It was really awkward. The food is not worth ruining your day over."}
{"text":"The decorations in the cafe were definitely on top - cozy and lay-back. I came here on a Sunday with 2 friends; 2 of us ordered the Alpha Omega and the other one ordered poached egg with avocado and gruyère on egg muffin. The food was pretty good and we didnt have to wait in line. It was a small cafe but the turnover rate of the customers were really fast. We got our food within 10 min. The only downside was they forgot about our coffee and only gave it to us towards the end, as we asked (though we could have asked earlier)."}
{"text":"The food was OUTSTANDING....I am give it a 3.5 overall.....I walked in and was the only person there (other than the 2 ladies working there)  They weren't super welcoming...I wasn't sure if I should order at the counter or sit down so I just ordered....She then let me know it was table service. Cool!  Once they took my order and delivered it...that was it. No check-ins...No can we get you anything else...  The bathroom is also INCREDIBLY SMALL...I don't think an average man would be able to fit in it..So be warned.  The Luna  breakfast was pretty tasty though!"}
{"text":"Decent brunch place in a residential neighbourhood. Cute spot! Personally, I don't think the line-ups are warranted. Generally speaking though, brunch line-ups are overrated. If you have to wait more than half an hour, come earlier or go somewhere else.   Signed, Your Favourite Hangry \"Foodie\"  p.s. Pear ginger juice is pretty great though! Would drink again."}
{"text":"Good food, sloppy service.  Very busy on weekends for brunch, so definitely expect waits - not just for a table, but for your coffee and your food.  When the food arrives, it is worth the wait. The bennies and wraps I have tried have been very good, served with a nice frisee side salad. I usually can't eat all of it, they do give you a lot.  Tiny space, with limited tables. In the warmer months, the few tables outside become coveted, which I don't understand as Dovercourt is pretty highly trafficked, and you're right on the street."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times since moving to the neighbourhood.  Easy to park - lots of side streets with free parking.  Limited seating - I've always shown up around 10-1130 and only had to wait about 10 minutes, or always got the last free table. Despite how busy it is, they bring your food quickly.  Good options - this is where they lose a star for me. I have been quite a few times as mentioned, but the menu isn't that diverse for breakfast on a weekend. So, I typically end up getting the same thing. Most items are variations of the same thing (benedict or a breakfast wrap). But - tasty nonetheless.  Coffee here is good and fresh squeezed juice. Love this little consistent spot!"}
{"text":"The sausage here is extremely unique and amazing. The distinct taste of fennel within the local sausage complemented my eggs over easy and french bread really well. The breakfast salad was also very good - topped with a very tasty dressing. The restaurant is in the eclectic arts district, and the location itself is a hidden gem off of the more major roads. Luna is highly worth seeking out for a breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"First time in Canada, I yelped a few places around where I was staying to grab breakfast before starting my day. Not wanting to be in the mix and more off center where my friend and I can have a quiet breakfast, this place seemed to be the most fitting. When you get here, you seat yourself. We decided to sit outside as the weather was beautiful, but that was a mistake. The tables are really small and there was a bowl for dogs to drink water near us. Probably not the best while dining out. We ordered salmon, amongst other things with was delicious, but the salmon was extremely salty. It was hard to finish our meal which took away from the experience as a whole. I would eat here again, but avoid the salmon."}
{"text":"The good:  Its very pretty, and somewhat secluded.  The food is decent which is to say I probably won't remember what I had there if you were to ask me in a week.  They have basic food, sandwiches and wraps.  You could find similar items at just about any cafe.  The bad: Its a bit pricy for what you get.  A sandwich with side salad and a smoothie is going to run you about $20.  There are other places in the area where that $20 will get you better food.  The ugly: It is unreasonably slow.  They have only 2 burners (a fact they do not disclose until you complain about the wait).  Myself, and those at tables near me waited more than half hour for simple dishes during lunch service.  It is unacceptable to have an empty table for so long.  I'm afforded the freedom of deciding my own schedule, but if I worked for any normal company I would be very late returning to work."}
{"text":"I discovered this cool little place while I was wandering around in the area and stopped in for some tea. I'm only giving it a 3 because I didn't eat there and therefore didn't get the full experience but I'd love to go back soon!"}
{"text":"I went there with a few friends for brunch yesterday and I wanted to write a review right away because I enjoyed it so much. It's small but we were seated right away. You could tell that it was a favourite amongst the locals. The brunch menu wasn't huge but it didn't need to be. The food was fantastic and I liked that the kitchen was right there and you could see it all being made fresh. It was very pleasant service, and the prices were very reasonable. I would absolutely go back!"}
{"text":"Came here today with a friend and absolutely love it. It's a little gem off to the side of the Ossington strip, so you have to go out of the way a bit but it's worth it.   Had the smoked salmon, avocado with dill. Almost half of my plate was spread with the smoked salmon which made the dish worth it, although a bit more on the pricey end.   The place is really cute, kept clean and nice. The washroom is honestly a closet. You walk in and the sink is already all up in your personal bubble.   The waitresses aren't as attentive as in don't fill your water every 5 minutes. But keep in mind it's a cafe, so that was okay.   Otherwise, it's definitely a great brunch place to try when around the area!"}
{"text":"Luna is a cozy, family-owned, corner restaurant hidden in a residential neighbourhood. Came for brunch on a Saturday at 11am and it was packed! Enjoyed their delicious Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict served with greens and potato cubes, which was the perfect portion to fill me up. The waitress was friendly, but slow due to the amount of tables she had to serve. I'd come back for a feel-good brunch for under $20!"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch!  I love that it's a bit off the beaten path, on a small street.  Makes it feel like you're on vacation - which is what weekends should feel like!  We usually get the smoked salmon over an English muffin with a poached egg on top.  The poached egg really seals the deal!  So rich and delicious.  The pancakes are great as well, they come with seasonal fruits and maple syrup.   The esperesso drinks are good here too!"}
{"text":"My new favorite cafe in Toronto. The food is really excellent, and it's got an unpretentious, warm, vibe. Smoked salmon breakfast was delicious, and they have an excellent section of tea, great coffee, and big wooden tables with lots of light."}
{"text":"Perfect neighbourhood brunch restaurant. I recently moved in next to the Luna cafe and was extremely happy that someone suggested it to me. The small cozy restaurant is perfect for fall lunches. Service was great even though the place was packed and there was only one server on.   Would love to try everything on the menu.  Will be back!!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood cafe, with a lovely patio.   My wife enjoyed a terrific scramble wrap with the most delicious mushrooms and gruyere.  Coffee was good and the service was both friendly and efficient!   Going back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast menu. Friendly service and great food.  Off the beaten path with a peaceful feel. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Have you ever heard of a breakfast place that doesn't offer free refills on drip coffee? Well this is it! I'm a neighborhood local and have eaten breakfast and brunch here numerous times but will not be going back. One server in particular has a huge attitude problem...beware."}
{"text":"Here's the thing . . . the food is great and the coffee is pretty good and usually that would be enough to bring me back again and again. I live across the street so I wish i felt like that was enough.   For some reason every single person who works here is so consistently rude and abrasive with me that I make a concerted effort to go elsewhere now. I have always tried to be as pleasant and good natured as possible when ordering and every time I have received rolled eyes and been practically barked at when trying to remember the name of their dill omelet sandwich.   Love the building and the location and the food. I just wished the people working there would take a vacation and lighten up a little bit."}
{"text":"I love going here for brunch! The food is tasty, the location is nice and quiet, and the place is hip! Also nearby Ossington if you're in the area. The smoked salmon is really good, and for some reason I'm obsessed with the side salad that comes with the dishes. The vinaigrette is simple but oh so good! The pancakes are a great option as well. This place is really a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Review is long overdue. Absolutely loved this brunch place! It's tucked away from the Ossington strip in one of the small streets. It was kind of cold when I arrived but I noticed there were patio tables which is perfect for summer time!  I came here for a bday brunch and it did not disappoint! I started with a chai latte which I believe is made with real tea bags vs. chai concentrate. Good, comes unsweetened. I ordered their peameal bacon benny and friends ordered the smoked salmon benny and poached eggs on wild mushrooms and arugula. Everyone really enjoyed their meal. We also all split the pancakes to try and they were nice and fluffy. Meals are about $14-$15 so I'd say the meals are a little pricier than what I'm used to for brunch but the presentation and taste of the food was worth it. The service was good too. We got checked on a few times by the servers.   It did get busy so I'd recommend going before 11 on a weekend!"}
{"text":"Luna Cafe is a small restaurant in our 'hood at Dovercourt/Argyle.  I wandered in one Sunday morning when I first moved here ten years ago. I checked out the menu. I'm not a big breakfast person and everything looked fancy ... no basic bacon and eggs ... so I left without ordering.  Gord and I checked it out this morning.  It's in the corner of a building ... it looks like it used to be a variety store.  Gord ordered poached eggs and peameal bacon on an English muffin with Hollandaise sauce. It came with potatoes and mixed greens. It was about $13.  I ordered buttermilk pancakes. It came with warm seasonal fruit (blueberries, pears and bananas) and organic yogurt. It was about $10.  The yogurt is supposed to be on the pancakes ... I asked for it on the side instead. It was delicious and I ate everything but the yogurt.  It's a small place and holds about 30 people. We got there about 10am ... it was jammed by 11am. Service was so-so ... that's okay if you aren't in a rush.  I'd go back again, especially in the summer when the patio opens."}
{"text":"The food is very nice and fresh and reasonably priced. The portion is a bit small though. I had the salmon Benny and my friend had the egg and trout bowl and they were delicious, just wished there were more home fries...they were so yummy but lack in portion size. It's like it's teasing me. Maybe that how the hipster in the area eats nowadays... petit and pretty.  One thing that bothered me is the ventilation is not very good here, I smell like I worked in the restaurants after my meal. I can't blame them because is a small operations and you are here more for the food."}
{"text":"This place is a delicious neighbourhood hang. BEST coffee, amazing brunch, and sweet service. So tasty, can't wait to return, and also check out their new location in the Junction!"}
{"text":"VIBE  I love the wooden tables, the Frida Kahlo-esque mural on the wall and the light shining through the windows. This is a mark of a good cafe. It was drafty inside and the wi-fi was spotty so I left (I had already had lunch at this point). Note: Lunch is done at 3 p.m. but the cafe is open until 5 p.m. Tres  hipster and in the middle of the Dovercourt hood, just south of Dundas and near Julie's Snack Bar. Staff seem lovely but a bit distant. Smallest bathroom EVER. The cafe was quite busy on an Easter Monday at 2 p.m. One of the few that were open in and around Ossington.   I DRANK The Love Crush (?) --rose and  hisbiscus water. This is not an \"iced tea.\" It was okay. I felt like it was hyped up water. Tasting the rose flavour was really nice but  not something I'd buy again for about $4.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  Maybe once in a LUNAr moon, I'll come here again but for lunch. On the weekend or on a day off. Not the best place to work in my opinion."}
{"text":"One of the reason why I love brunchin in downtown Toronto is finding little jems like Luna Cafe. Cozy, friendly and best of all, it's nestled in a residential neighbourhood.   If you are looking for the typical breakfast like eggs, sausage and toast, you go to sunset grill but you feel like getting adventurous with you taste buds, come here.  I ordered the wild mushroom poached egg served with potatoes and arugula while the hubby got the alpha omega with side toast. All the ingredients were really fresh with unique blend of flavours. It was delicious!   They serve reunion island coffee which is a bonus for me!"}
{"text":"In town for work, I found this place while searching for free range eggs at a breakfast spot. What a find!!! So, so, so, SO pleased. It's located off the main business district on Queen in a lovely neighborhood on Dovercourt. The staff is delightful, the food homey, healthy and delicious and the atmosphere cozy and perfect. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This cafe should be used as the definition of neighbourhood cafe. It is in the middle of a residential area, inside what was an old corner convenience shop. The service was a little scattered (regulars saying hi and greeted while dealing with orders) but very friendly, and the food was excellent, had the pancakes for brunch."}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday afternoon for brunch. It's a causal and cosy cafe in the neighbourhood. It wasn't too busy there were only a couple tables there.   The food was amazing we got the breakfast special and the alpha omega (I would recommend getting the toast with it). Super yummy !  The service was a disappointment she was very rude during our whole stay there. When we asked politely for certain things she'll give it to us like she's doing us a huge favour. She never smiled and made us uncomfortable during our lunch.   Probably won't come back again due to service . You can find better service and food elsewhere in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"They put yogurt on their pancakes and ruin perfectly delicious pancakes. Have your wits about you and order the yogurt on the side, like I should have, otherwise you'll be scraping it off, unable to expunge that acrid taste.  We came here last Sunday to have brunch with friends. I ordered the pancakes and my husband ordered the poached with bacon. He loved the eggs and the bacon. You know already how I felt about the pancakes.  I think they even gave us free refills on coffee, but I'm not  sure."}
{"text":"What a terrific little hidden gem this place is. Hidden from the view of the main streets, that is. Cuz the people seem to know about it, cuz I have heard them talking about it.  I happen to live right off of Dovercourt, and thus walk down this street all the time. I'm not sure how long these guys have been here, but I think I've been missing them for awhile. The service was very pleasant, and the coffee delicious. I'm not sure if I just picked a good time to go, but I had my choice of tables, by the window!, and a nice quiet (but not too quiet) moment in the day to enjoy my sandwich and free weekly Toronto-culture newspaper.   And the sandwich really was excellent. I loved it; grilled, free-range chicken breast, arugula, sun-dried tomatoes, roasted red peppers and goat's cheese. I feared that the combination might be a little too familiar, since I eat some combination of these ingredients on an almost daily basis. But they managed to make it somehow taste a bit more interesting than I was expecting. I think it was some kind of magical mayonnaise or something. Pretty basic oil and vinegar on the salad wasn't exactly a revelation, but everything I eat doesn't need to be. Sometimes it's just good."}
{"text":"Discovering this gem literally at the next block of my neighbourhood was amazing. Decided to stop by Luna's on a Sunday morning and we didn't have to wait long and was suited, great service and cozy atmosphere. We order eggs bennies and pancakes to share. I really enjoyed the pancakes as the pear gives it a quite refreshing and unique taste in comparison to other pancakes I've had during brunch. Definitely recommend this brunch spot!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is very quaint and cute, ideal for brunch dates and is situated right in the heart of Little Portugal. It was also a 10 minute walk to Trinity Bellwoods. I came here with three other friends for Saturday brunch and we were seated immediately without any reservations. Finding free parking was also painless as well. You can literally park anywhere for free alongside the streets of the neighborhood.   The only bad thing I can say about this place is how small the washrooms are (there's only one stall and it's unisex). I'm 4'11 and I find it small so it's not ideal to bring a baby or stroller to this restaurant as you won't get much room.   In regards to the food, The food portion was just right so I didn't become overwhelmingly full. I ordered the avocado toast with poached eggs. It was very delicious, I devoured the entire plate in minutes.  Would definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Not your average breakfast/brunch. Our dishes were highly creative, locally sourced and delicious. It wasn't overly pricey either.  My tip is to skip Luna if you're looking for a conventional breakfast, but do come when you're feeling more adventurous."}
{"text":"The food was perfect! Had lunch here with a friend last week. I had the smoked salmon, avocado and poached egg with sourdough bread side and my friend had the French breakfast thing with Brie, sausage and sourdough. All of which were very tasty. And good coffee too! Will 100% be back"}
{"text":"This tiny cafe is tucked away in a residential neighbourhood just north of Queen Street - it's so remote that you'd almost think you were heading along on the wrong street because it's amongst apartment complexes and houses. It's small and seats only about 30 people so make sure you don't wait till the prime hour of 11:30-12:30 to get your weekend brunch or you'll be waiting a while to get a seat.  Everyone at my table ordered pretty much the same thing - a grilled breakfast wrap with eggs and beans for fillings and there wasn't a single crumb remaining on any of our plates!"}
{"text":"Holy crap is this place ever cute.   I'm moving a whole three blocks away from where I live now (into a fabulous full house, braggity brag), but as we Torontonians know, three blocks makes a huge difference. Where is my new go to coffee shop? Where is my new go to convenience store? Where is my new go to breakfast place... ding ding ding! Luna is my new breakfast place. Fewf, I can check that one off the list.   Since today was my first time at Luna, I had already eaten before coming (like a numpty), so I just grabbed a juice and a snack to go... but holy hell! I will be back for beautiful plates of eggs, locks and pancakes. What a fantastic neighbourhood find."}
{"text":"Nice and cozy place with friendly staff. Had an amazing brunch with small kids. The kids liked the Salmon Wrap and asked for another portion. Mushroom and Salmon Poached were good as well."}
