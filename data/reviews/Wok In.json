{"text":"I really appreciate this place. That atmosphere is calm and casual. It's no typical Asian dine in place. They have a mix of Chinese,Vietnamese and all other varieties of Asian cuisine. It's not fancy but i you're looking for a Asian place that's not Panda Express then go here. The prices are reasonable and the food is yummy. The ca gio (viet crispy egg rolls) is my fave along with Padthai and pho!! Every time I visit my parents I always stop by here to eat. The workers and owners here are very sweet,friendly and polite. I hope they plan on doing a second wok in in the west valley,because this place isn't a disappointment."}
{"text":"I was surprised when I walked in here, it was clean looking.  Tried a late lunch before heading out of town. I read so much about the pot stickers that I had to try them.  They were $4.99 for 8 pieces. (thumbs up).  They were actually good. I was in the mood for noodles so I had the chicken Lo Mein and my other half had the orange chicken and a diet soda.  Oh yea have the Thai Ice tea (its awesome).  The orange chicken was good it was crunchy and the breading was thin so you can tell that you were eating chicken.  Now my Lo mein was ok, not much flavor and it seem like they use spaghetti noodles... as we were waiting I saw that other tables were ordering their pot stickers so its popular there. The service is really good. Most of the menu items are priced at $4.99 which lets you experiment and try dishes because its not gonna cost you an arm or leg."}
{"text":"Cheap price for quality taste. Staff was very friendly and there was very little waiting."}
{"text":"The service was bad and while the food wasn't inedible, it was definitely not good. We went in and waited for probably 5 min to be seated. Once we were seated we waited about 10-15 min and no one came back to even get our drink order. At that point we just decided to place our order to go bc we figured we would be there for quite a while with how much waiting we were doing. We went up to the register to place our order and it was another 10 min before someone came to take the order. They seemed very understaffed bc everyone was doing something but they should have more staff on hand so customers aren't having to wait so long for everything. I ordered the #4 Vietnamese Spring rolls and they were definitely the only Vietnamese spring rolls that I've ever had that weren't delicious. They definitely didn't taste authentic like they do at every other Vietnamese restaurant I've had them at. The peanut sauce was horrible. My husband got the Mongolian Beef and he said he's had better at many other restaurants. Definitely not worth going back to."}
{"text":"I went to this place when it was still Feedbag and then turned into Wok In. I'm generous with the ratings, because the price is very good, the staff is friendly and attentive, and they have the best Vietnamese fresh spring roll. Just love it!! That, and also spicy long beans with shrimp (and/or tofu)."}
{"text":"For $5 per entree with white rice, it's hard to beat Wok In.  We had the Kung Pao and Mongolian Beef.  Both were flavorful, packed with meat and vegetables and were just the right size.  We ordered one entree with fried rice and found it mildly mushy and bland--stick with the white rice.  The service was reasonable considering how crowded it was at 5 pm on a Friday night."}
{"text":"I had the tofu pad thai and it was very light and healthy tasting, I usually prefer it greasier but this was a nice alternative. The tofu would have been better if it were drained a bit more before cooking. The iced tea was really good and my entire meal was only about seven bucks...wow. I will be back for sure to try some of the other menu items. The service was wonderful. Would have given 5 stars if the tofu were crispier."}
{"text":"My family and I just love this place  great food and the price is very reasonable.  I enjoy their lunch and dinner menu. Their Chai Iced Tea is absolutely delicious. You will not be disappointed in dining here. The staff is always nice and friendly and the service is very good here. and the food is tasty  and always prepared fresh. I go there for the food and never disappointed."}
{"text":"WOW! This place is really good! The menu looks like Pei Wei, except the dishes are half the price.  I had the orange chicken & steamed rice.  All white breast meat with just the right amount of sauce.  I'm used to orange chicken being a spicy dish.  It's not here, but the flavor is really good.  I'm sure you could request it spicy if you wish.  Some might thing the portions are a little on the small side, but considering each dish is only $4.99, order a couple of different dishes and share.  The dining room is nicely decorated and very clean.  I was greeted before I had taken 2 steps inside the door by a very friendly young lady, who promptly took my order.  My meal was ready to go in 5 or 6 minutes.  I drove 10 minutes to my home, and my food was still hot and delicious.  Can't wait to take my finicky wife for a sit down lunch and try the hot & spicy soup and some crab angels.  Wok In is definitely a wonderful addition to the NE Mesa dining scene.  They are open daily from 11am to 9pm."}
{"text":"I've been here 5 times now and the service is always excellent as well as the food. The Pad Thai is awesome!"}
{"text":"Have driven past the Wok In for ages and finally decided to give it a try.

The chicken Kung Pao was amazing.  We like it HOT and it was - and there were plenty of vegetables and the sauce was very good. The white rice was moist and good. 

The Spicy Basil Noodles w chicken were less amazing. The noodles were a bit clumpy  -- and even though we requested also HOT they were more medium -- but they get bonus points for having shredded carrots on top and over-all the flavor was pretty good.

The chicken for both dishes was cooked just right -- tender and all white meat from what we could tell -- and not overcooked or chewy.  

We thought the portions were fair - and actually got a lot of the noodle dish -- and the price was very affordable -- 12 and change for both including tax.

We received a friendly greeting when we arrived -- and the young woman who rang us up was pleasant.

We got take-out and already plan to go back and eat there sometime -- and are glad to have finally checked it out.

----------------------

Finally made it back 9-20-17...and had the Spicy Basil Noodles again.  This time they were not \"clumpy\" at all.  I asked for them hot and they were a bit hotter.  Sadly there were hardly any carrots this time around but the entire dish was very good.

Definitely planning return trips."}
{"text":"The Wok In is a standard sit-down, waiter-style Chinese restaurant and it was great.  The people were super friendly and helpful, the menu was simple and all the entrees were $5, and most importantly; it was really good food.  Their sweet and sour sauce was just right and the orange chicken had that fresh orange zest that's missing from most takeout or fast-food Chinese places you go.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Super-duper good!

At this time (Jan 2011) it seems like they're still just getting off the ground with the restaurant.  They just converted the building from the \"Feed Bag\" restaurant, which nobody ever went to.  The decor could use a little more work to feel really Chineezy.  They still need to develop their menu a little bit too.  They've got some good sides and entrees but not a lot of appetizers and no desserts.  I liked the food so much I was disappointed to hear they had no dessert menu.

We went on a Friday night and took our five kids with us.  The staff was super helpful and the other diners were friendly and accepting.  I guess what I'm trying to get at is this is not an \"upscale\" place.  It's a family place in an unfashionable part of town, so it's perfect for the location.  If you're just looking for some really good food and great service at a cheap price, try it out.

{"text":"First time eating here after driving past this place all the time. Don't judge a book by its cover by looking at the outside and its location.  I ordered the egg drop soup, their hot tea, and the steamed vegetables with shrimp and a side of peanut sauce.  Their egg drop was the best I've had in a while, and was surprised to see tofu in it.  The tea was brewed to perfection.  The steamed veggies with shrimp and the peanut sauce on the side was soo good.  Definitely coming here again since I'm usually picky about Asian food, but this place won me over. Five stars!"}
{"text":"This hidden gem is great. The Beef Pho is excellent! Also the Chicken Teriyaki is awesome, and they don't skimp on the portions. Give it a try if you can."}
{"text":"Back for another stop. Spicy fried chicken and pan seared salmon tonight. Excellent again. Total bill under $15. It is in our normal rotation."}
{"text":"There's never really anybody here and they play elevator music so  it can feel a little  creepy at first, but the food WAY makes up for it. The staff isn't 'amazing' but they are pleasant enough. On average a plate cost like $5.00 so you really can't beat it. They've got grandma cooking in the back, so you know it's fresh, if you want good Chinese, Wok In is the place to go."}
{"text":"Only Chinese food worth having in the central AZ area! Definitely try the basil fried rice- life changing!"}
{"text":"Great place unbelievable prices. I had the Kung Pao chiken with white rice, great taste, great value. Will come back each time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Good food - everything is very fresh.   Limited menu but everything is prepared from scratch at time of order.  Very efficient and friendly wait staff.  Minimal decor.  Most all dishes are $4.99 with just a couple of exceptions.  Good value."}
{"text":"It may not look like much, but the food was surprisingly good for a mom and pop looking place. The vegetarian pad tai was done quite well, with just a little bit of sweetness to the sauce and well cooked rice noodles. The veggie egg rolls were also well worth a try. Everything was served piping hot and fresh."}
{"text":"I am glad that this place is so close to our home. Great food at a great price. My fiance and I come here a lot, mostly for take out. We have eaten in the dining room several times, which is always very clean. The staff is always so nice and always recognize us when we come in. We love their potstickers and crab angels. My fiance loves the orange chicken and Bo Luc Lac and I love just about everything. Some other good dishes are the basil fried rice, pad thai, and curry chicken. They have terrific Thai iced tea and Vietnamese iced coffee as well! I always recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great food for the price. The pot stickers are a  favourite . Service is courteous and quick."}
{"text":"Our family has been coming here for almost two years now and we have yet to have a bad experience. We are always welcomed with a warm greeting and polite service which really adds to the Asian atmosphere. The family that runs the place are very humble and genuinely care about your experience. Almost all the entrees are priced at 5 bucks, and you can't really beat it for what you get. The food is consistently good and portions sufficiently large. We will continue to make this place a usually stop! Ps. Sweet and Sour chicken is a favorite."}
{"text":"Food is great, usually fast service, very affordable. People are friendly. Of the 4 times we have been here, tonight's service has been the slowest. Great pho and pad Thai noodles are amazing!"}
{"text":"$=good deal
:)=full tummy

This is the first time I have been to Wok In, the staff is very friendly and helpful and the restaurant is clean.  If you are a patron of those Express Chinese places (you know the one with the panda)...you will be impressed with this place, because 1...it is a sit down restaurant and 2... the food is better than theirs.  

The orange chicken is wonderful, lightly battered and deep fried with a flavorful sauce...hot, steamy and delicious...not hard with a ton of batter and over done.  The chicken pieces were of a nice size and the portion...lets say this I had to bring half of it home.  

The Thai Iced tea is wonderful and I was impressed with the value for the money.  I will make this my NEW place to get good Asian Fusion at a great price."}
{"text":"Popped in today to just grab a snack on my way home. To go ordered Pot Stickers. YUM. I have had their pad Thai and soups. Always good. Nice service. Clean local place to dine."}
{"text":"Was leery of coming in as the name does not give warm fuzzies, but was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness, service, and freshness of their food. One of the best Phad Thai I have found in the Phoenix metro area! Nice prices and nice portions make this a must try place to eat!"}
{"text":"It's a quiet, clean little place. The staff is very attentive and quick to come to your need. I ordered the Extra Spicy  Kung Pao chicken, I highly recommend it. I will be back again!"}
{"text":"The pros: quick service, the food was brought out promptly, ordered the teriyaki chicken and hot and sour soup, which were both good, very affordable, also really liked that there were fresh flowers on each table from a local florist. The cons: massive dining room that was not being used to capacity so some lights were turned off in the corner of the room (did not turn me off, just thought it was odd), smaller portions, not enough veggies and too much rice on my plate. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Had the Mongolian beef--worst I've ever tasted. The place is old and dingy, but they have kep their prices very low--unfortunately didn't make up for the food."}
{"text":"We had just finished a 6 mile mountain biking adventure in Usery Park and were craving some tasty pho. Wok In was less than 6 miles from the park and along our route home, so we decided to walk in to Wok In. :)

The decor seemed a little outdated, but the staff was very welcoming and friendly. I looked around to see what the other patrons were eating which seemed to be Americanized Chinese food. We were a little nervous about the quality of broth since I didn't see anyone else ordering pho. 

To our delight, the broth was actually really flavorful and didn't have any fat bubbles. Although not like the pho from Cali or NYC, it definitely satisfied my craving. We also ordered fresh shrimp spring rolls and tea. The bill came out to about $20 which was a great deal. 

We will stop by again should we return from another day trip in Usery Park."}
{"text":"This place deserves more credit! Their food is amazing, quick, great service- and inexpensive! I couldn't believe it the first time we went. I love their vermicelli bowl, crab Angels, Pad Thai and salad rolls. We always leave a big tip because you can tell they work hard and care deeply about the service! If you want quality Thai food at an affordable price, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Found this little place about a year ago and now the Wok In is a MUST STOP for my Vietnamese Pho fix! Really great soup (in a ginormous bowl) at an unbelievably low price! With your choice of chicken, tofu, beef or shrimp, the fresh basil, noodles and broth warms all the way down. Comfort food at it's finest! Want something spicier? Set yourself up with a bowl of their Spicy Sate Soup. It'll light those taste buds right up!

Here's a tip- When sitting down, be sure to get an appetizer order of the Goi Cuon which is a fresh vietnamese vegetable & shrimp spring roll with a side of hoisin sauce. YOU WON'T BE SORRY!

You're sure to leave with a full stomach and little damage to your wallet!"}
{"text":"Sometimes writing is therapeutic in ending a relationship.  Spoken aloud, the name puts a grimace on my face, as once spoken with great joy now evokes deep regret.  For the last 4 months I've had permutations of this conversation with my wife:

\"Hmmm I don't really feel like cooking.\" Me
\"Well we could order delivery.\" Wife.  Face begins to morph into the Why-do-I-put-up-with-you-face.
\"We could.  Orrrrrrrrrrrrr we could... wok in!  Ahahahahaha.\" Me
\"Why did I marry you.\" Wife.
\"Well if you need to, you can always wok out!  Ahahahahaha.\" Me
THE GLARE. Wife.

With heart afloat with punny happiness, I approached this Chinese restaurant called Wok In.  Situated prominently on the corner of Sossaman and Main, a tinge of trepidation shook me as I noted that their signage had only a single letter working.  Eating at O isn't as fun as Wok In, but I figured the food should be what concerns me.  Walking up some steps that they kindly warn you about, I enter and the restaurant feels spacious, probably can seat 120-ish.  Pretty worn decor but no points off for that.  Momentary confusion as they have a order counter, but also full service seating.  Nice server with very cheerful disposition seats and takes drink order which is iced tea, which arrives very promptly.  I decide to try their egg drop soup, goi cuon, and bun cha gio thit nuong.  I don't quite remember, but I want to say everything was $2 except the bun, which was around $7.

After ordering the server asks me if I'm Vietnamese.  Sure am!  Clouds pass over the previously unrelenting sunny disposition as she swiftly departs to place my order.  Surprised, I take another look around my surroundings, and note the absence of any of my people.  Knowing many caucasians with excellent taste in asian cuisine, I shrug off the demographics and tell myself everything will be okay.  

Egg drop soup arrives very promptly.  Its tolerable.  Less eggy than most but with lots of carrot, corn, some cabbage, flavor is a bit weak but veggies redeem it slightly.  

Goi Cuon much more disappointing.  Stuffed with a lot of lettuce, bean sprout, and 3 shrimp between the 2 rolls. No pork. The sauce was pure bottled hoisin with some sprinkled peanuts on top.

Then my favorite cool noodle dish, Bun Cha Gio Thit Nuong.  Normally this is a bright, herbaceous dish with slippery rice noodles, lots of herbs/veggies, and savory pork slices grilled + egg rolls.  The cha gio (fried egg roll) were really tasty, and grilled beef was nice enough, but the fish sauce was very watery, and lettuce was probably 30% of the volume of this dish.  Some good bits to this dish but overall unbalanced and depressing with the weak nuoc mam.

Well.  Time to walk up and pay for my food.  Server timidly asks if I liked the food.  She gets an unconvincing yea it was fine.  She can tell and quietly says goodbye.  I say good bye as well.  Good bye to the server, good bye to a fun pun that I can't use anymore as its just depressing to think of, good bye to a Chinese restaurant with Vietnamese owners who make bad Viet food, good bye to it all... I wok out."}
{"text":"Great service from the minute we walked in the door. Food was pretty good and we'll be back if we happen to be in the area and want Asian food."}
{"text":"Very fresh food that is well prepared! Recommend the low mein. Nice atmosphere and excellent service. Highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Decent restaurant, good menu, good prices. Most meals ready and served in less than 10 minutes. 

Dining area is mostly clean but they never clean windows. The floors and tables are always clean. On any average day about 1/3 of the ceiling lights are not working which could be deliberate I suppose.

I've only had carry out from this restaurant but every time I go the place is busy which is a testimony to the quality of their food. 

It's seems to be a generic Asian menu, I don't think it represents any particular country. I've had their curry chicken which is marked as being spicey which I think is tasty but not hot.

I've been here ten times and never had any problems.

Easy access off Main Street and Sossaman. Private lot, plenty of parking. Check out the menu online ahead of time."}
{"text":"Had some Kung Pao, and it was good.  They used actual hot peppers instead of chili powder like some of the lesser restaurants.  But the portion size was small and the price high for what little I got.  
Also tried the hot and spicy soup.  It was neither hot nor spicy, but it tasted fine.  And again, there wasn't much of it."}
{"text":"The service was fast and friendly, the restaurant is newly remodeled and very clean, and you can't beat the prices. My husband had the Cha Gio and really enjoyed them. We both had beef dishes for our entrees. I had the Bo Luc Lac and he had the Beef Sate. Both dishes were fresh and very flavorful and the beef was tender and delicious. This place is a great addition to the limited selection of non-chain restaurants in the far East valley. We will be returning soon to try the pot stickers."}
{"text":"I wanted to like the place. We just moved out to East Mesa and were excited about trying a local spot. We were hungry and wanted a good tasty place to eat lunch. 

The restaurant is large and clean. Most tables filled with mostly seniors, although half the place was closed off. I was excited at the idea of Thai/Chinese/Vietnamese all in one spot and what I consider pretty cheap prices. I ordered the Pad Thai while my daughter got her regular - Orange Chicken. 

Food came out promptly once we were finally waited on, seemed under staffed. The Pad Thai was not at all good. It was mostly just lukewarm noodles sparsely dotted with chicken, peanuts and bean sprouts. No flavor at all and why is so wet??? I know Pad Thai can vary between places but this was the worst I've had, sorry to say. The orange chicken was better with a strong taste of real orange, though it was very heavily breaded, which is not unusual for OC.

Not sure I'd come back, even though it is very low priced. The Pad Thai was so wrong, its hard to look past. I would've done better with a cup of ramen noodles made from my microwave, even though I hate ramen."}
{"text":"Place wasn't bad, food wasn't bad, just seemed overpriced. Parking in this complex where it's located can also be maddening. Overall, I don't think I'll return to this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I have visited Wok In four times now, and can't wait to go back again and again. Excellent service, their wait staff has always been very attentive to our table and our needs. Fast service! Delicious food: their crab angels, pot stickers, and egg rolls are delicious. Soup is very tasty. Their main menu items are priced $4.99-$6.99, are flavorful, and nice sized portions. Their Thai Iced Teas and Coffees are very very good too! The best Asian food in East Mesa, hands down. The decor is simple, which I can appreciate, and our last visit had fresh flowers on almost every table, which I loved. My husband and I also love the ambient classical music playing in the background. It is a very nice experience going to Wok In! We are always impressed with each visit."}
{"text":"Really friendly staff but their pho isn't very good.  Not much flavor, noodles or vegetables"}
{"text":"This place used to be known as the Feedbag a few years back but now has been turned into a local chinese food spot. When you first walk in you are greeted by a very nice person (big points) and offered a table. The place is decorated simply yet is very clean and open. In fact you can see into the kitchen through the large service window. 

The food selection is very simple yet really well done. Most people who like chinese or just want a change from the all you can eat buffet will enjoy eating here as the food is affordable (each dish under $5) and very well prepared. After going over the menu I decided to try the chicken teriyaki over steamed white rice. Note: there is an extra charge for brown rice. It also came with a side of steamed broccoli which was good but a little to crunchy. The chicken was cooked perfectly with the sauce adding that nice bit of sweet flavor you expect. Not overpowering, it also added nice flavor to the rice.

The place has not been up and running for long but I can see myself visiting them again soon. If you are in the area stop in and check them out."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! We especially love to come when we are super hungry because there's never a wait! The service is great and the food comes out very fast. We always get the pho and love it!"}
{"text":"Didn't like it !!!! We ordered orange chicken , sweet and sour chicken , rolls and pho . Nothing was good , definitely you get what you pay"}
{"text":"It's the ghetto version of pei Wei.  It's really cheap but nothing to be excited .
I had higher expectation because the owner  also ones Saigon in chandler.  
I wish the food is more authentic like Saigon."}
{"text":"Clean, fast & attentive service.  Food is cheap and flavorful.  Order a few things to share cuz you won't have worry about an outrageous bill.  Spicy beef satay soup was very good and the lo mein was everything could have hoped for: A nice mix of vegetables done just right, noodles that weren't  soggy, and a very tasty sauce."}
{"text":"Food is ok, nothing to write home about.  Prices for what you get are bit steep. For example, 4.99 lunch gets you an entire with rice only, no sides. 

However, if you head down the road 5 minutes away, j&m chinese food for $5 will get you an entre, rice, crab puff, salad and soup!

For the money,  I just can't recommend wok in when their competition down the road gives do much more At Equal Or Better quality."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here several times over the last 2 years. Highly recommend this friendly, fairly inexpensive, extremely tasty meal. We've come here about 2-3 times a month. I have personally had about 75% of the menu. I would eat everything I have tried again, and rotate between 3-4 dishes regularly."}
{"text":"As the others have stated, this place is great!!! The ingredients are fresh, the portions large, and the prices reasonable. The next time I order the Pad Thai I'll request it be made a bit less sweet and have them add some chili sauce for some \"bite\" as I'm used to having it less sweet and a bit spicy. Every order is cooked-up fresh so special requests aren't a problem."}
{"text":"My husband & son tried this place last night & we were not impressed. Yes the service was friendly & fast, the food however wasn't the best. The price is right for the mediocre food we received, it's cheap and fast. However, I'd rather pay more and get food that I'd actually like to eat. If you don't want to spend a ton of money to get your Chinese food fix then this is the place for you. But if you actually want to enjoy your food go some place else."}
{"text":"2nd time this week we've eaten here...once eating in and the other for our takeout. Both times it was just great. And so affordable. A nice mix of Thai, Vietnamese, and Chinese on the menu. A real find. I wish I lived here so I could make it a regular stop. But we will make a point of visiting whenever we are in Mesa."}
{"text":"If I need a quick bite of Asian cuisine, I'd come here. They have a general variety of foods, decent prices, very clean and nice atmosphere, super friendly staff, not the best or most authentic, but pretty good for the area."}
{"text":"This place was super quick to have our order ready for carry out and was pretty tasty,  especially for the great price! I didn't particularly love how many veggies were thrown in with their Beijing beef (it was almost hard to find the bits of beef in the mixture), but the beef itself was very flavorful and I LOVED their potstickers!"}
{"text":"Great prices, great food! My favorite restaurant anywhere near the Phoenix Metro Area. Everything on the menu tastes fantastic! Can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Lovely, chic Asian restaurant. Pho is great! (The dish that is like pho but without broth is also superb!) Would highly recommend Basil Fried Rice, can't go wrong with Thai Tea! (Unless you have heart conditions/diabetes)! 
The owners are very kind, down to earth people, and the service is FAST!!!"}
{"text":"Finally found real asian food with flavor in the valley! Service is great, pricing is more than reasonable and the food is amazing! We ordered the orange chicken, spicy Thai chicken and chicken lo mein spicy with peanuts! Everything was delicious, chicken quality was great, crab ragoons/wontons were crispy and fried in fresh oil! Definitely coming back! =)"}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a new and close Chinese place to go to. I found this restaurant and Yelp and since it was pretty close and had good reviews, we decided to check it out. 

I wasn't sure where it was so I used GPS to get there. It was already dark so most places in that shopping center were already closed. The restaurant is easy to miss if you follow GPS to be honest cause it instructed us to turn into the shopping center way before we were close to the restaurant and we kinda had to figure out where it was. If we had stayed on the main road we would have seen it and then turned in. Entrance for the restaurant is on the side when you park in the back. 
The first thing you notice when you walk in is how big and spacious the restaurant is. It's also super clean! 

We were seated immediately. The place was not busy at all. We noticed how cheap the prices were! We ordered spring rolls, sweet and sour chicken and replaced the rice with noodles and we ordered beef with vegetables with rice.

The food came out in a very short time, we were shocked. Food was fresh and piping hot. My husband and I shared everything. We both agreed it was pretty good. As soon as we finished, our check was out. 

Very fast service and pretty good food for the price we paid. We will probably be trying them again in the near future!"}
{"text":"So today I decided to try a place I have passed by many times. The reviews seemed good and I wanted to try it for myself. Once I walked in I was \"greeted and seated\" and a drink order was placed. I was happy with the quickness of service. I noticed that almost everything on the menu was $4.99. What a great concept. I picked the veggie eggrolls to start with and I thought they were pretty dang good for $2.99 for 4. I ordered the spicy sate soup beef and it was good as well. I would recommend trying this place because for the money it's worth it!"}
{"text":"If there's nothin' else around, wheredyago?

They are the sister company to Saigon Pho, one of our fave.  It's descent food...not much choices in the surrounding area.   Your  little above average Chinese fast food entrees starting at $5, with good service, can't beat that.  

No lazy Susan= no family dining choices. 

If I live closer,  I may go back...but it's not worth my drive."}
{"text":"This place is nice clean with great service the food was so greasy I couldn't eat it not my first choice good thing it's cheap because you will need to eat soon after"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, especially for the area.  some of the best Asian food i have ever had.  The thai rice noodles were thin and tender.  The lo mein noodles were also fantastic.  Oh, and the crab puffs were DELISH!  Not the fried cream cheese that other places try and pass off.  The decor was kind of plain, but it was clean and tasteful.  The speed of was decent, especially considering that they were pretty busy on a Wednesday night.  I could ask for more polite staff though.  We'll definately go back soon."}
{"text":"This place is great! Excellent value for your dollar and super tasty food! My son was a huge fan of the crispy, sweet, and tangy orange chicken. I tried the Thai Spicy Crispy Chicken and enjoyed the combination of flavors; I can't wait to try more if their dishes! I was surprised by the quality of food, clean and relax atmosphere, and food service. If you live in the area and haven't checked this place out you're doing something wrong!"}
{"text":"So I'm back in my old stompin' ground and decided to check out my favorite Asian fusion restaurant to date. It's still serving basic, solid Asian food from China, Vietnam and Thailand. Keep up the good job guys.

Today it was time to get the #22 with beef. It's just as good as I remember.

I also tried a new thing on the menu - chocolate mousse cake... it was good enough to satisfy your sweet tooth.

In the future I wonder if any other desserts will be offered that use more traditional ingredients such as red bean paste. But, considering the pedestrian palates in this neighborhood it probably won't happen anytime soon.

Until next time."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. Nothing is extremely fancy but prices are very low and this is a family owned restaurant run by the same family all the time. Their Vietnamese dishes are all $5 and make a great after church lunch."}
{"text":"I was craving fried rice and lo mein but I didn't want to go to Panda Express. So I decided to try this place out because of the good reviews, plus it's only 3 miles away from my house. I didn't dine in, I called them and ordered for pick up. I got the basil fried rice with tofu, lo mein noodles with tofu and the steamed veggies with tofu (I absolutely love tofu!!!!) the steamed veggies also come with white rice and a brown sauce. I thought all of the food I got was going to be side dishes since everything was only 4.99 but nope, I literally got 3 big entrees. You get a lot of food for what you pay for. The lo mein was delicious and the veggie plate with steamed rice and brown sauce was mouth watering. The basil fried rice was a little funky because of the basil haha it's really good but then you get hit with an intense after taste of basil. I can handle it but people who absolutely cannot stand basil should skip it or ask if they can get the rice without the basil. I just threw some soi sauce on it and it was yummy. I only gave this place 4 stars because I don't know how their dine in experience works but next time I will definitely go here to eat instead of calling in. I also will try some of their entrees with meat in it to see how it taste. So all in all, the food was great and the price was even better. You gotta try this place!"}
{"text":"Yummy & reasonably priced. I had the Crispy Fried Thai Chicken and the sauce was amazing plus the chicken was breast meat. The Basil fried Rice, as well as, the Kung Pao Shrimp were excellent. This place us a find for sure. I plan on visiting again on my next trip. I haven't had this good of food for this price since last mallineum. SCORE!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy food for cheap! We got pad Thai which was good. Nothing mind blowing but you can't beat it for the price and you get a good size serving. Next time id ask them to spice it up a bit."}
{"text":"The only reason this place loses a star is their 'crab angels', which are mostly wrapper with very little cream cheese/crab mix in the middle.

The rest of the food, however, is really good.  Never had a bad meal, and we've been through quite a few dishes--my favorite so far is the curry chicken.  I'm nuts for Indian curry, and tried their curry on a whim.  It was delicious!  It's cheap, always fresh and piping hot, and the people are friendly.  And now that I live nearby again, this will be my go-to for \"Chinese\" (really the food is more Vietnamese) take out."}
{"text":"Great service, good food, at the best price!  :)   I've been to this restaurant several times and can recommend the following items:

Basil fried rice: flavorful and delicious, different from the generic fried rice at other restaurants

Salmon: seared so that it has that crispy glazed edge.  one of my favorite items.  Might ask for sauce on the side though because they give a lot.

Crab angels: always delicious, crispy, and warm!

Overall, the restaurant is a bit far from the phoenix area, but it is well worth the drive.  There is a lot of seating, which makes it a great place for parties!  Friendly staff is always a plus as well."}
{"text":"Fairly new place. It has been opened for couple of months now. The place looks pretty clean. Food is very affordable. Sizes a reasonable and filling. I have only been there two times and so far every item we have selected from the menu has been an A+. 

I recommend the Curry chicken, Spicy Thai Basil Noodles, Pad Thai and Orange Chicken with Brown rice (soft, tangy and flavorful). They also have Thai Iced Tea (refreshing earthy-herbal flavor tea with milk). 

Today I had the Crab Angels as an appetizer...probably not worth the price. 

Go and try this restaurant and let me know what you think!!!"}
{"text":"When you have that itch and you need that fix you know you gonna WOK-ON-IN , this is my new go too staple , great quality great price great service ."}
{"text":"Fast, fresh, friendly service, and seriously...... you can't beat the prices with a stick!  So awesome."}
{"text":"I am giving this place 4 stars because the price was  so good and compared to the food I was impressed. For cheaper than a fast food meal you can get a good tasty meal here. I would order take from here."}
{"text":"The reviews all seemed super legit. Pricing was super low, but you got what you paid for here. My egg drop soup was not what either of us were expecting. It looked like the dumped a can of mushrooms in both of ours, along with tofu and lots of peas. Very disappointing. The spicy Thai chicken was not spicy at all and pretty bland. The fried rice was terrible. I don't know what they cooked it in, maybe some tuna water?  Was disappointed because the reviews were pretty great stating \"hidden gem\" but it was far from it."}
{"text":"Teaching my fiance how to say pho correctly without giggling. His first time eating Vietnamese food. For real? We have eaten there twice in the past week.

I so enjoy a good spring roll. I am a spring roll critic.  Their spring rolls are good. However, somebody needs to teach them how to make peanut sauce. 
The crab angels are delicious!

Place is clean. Staff is friendly. Noise level is normal or maybe too quiet.  You can too easily hear conversations.  Young women in the booth next to us chatting away saying; \"like\" this , like that, like like like like like every other word. Must be some kind of infliction that makes one sound unintelligent.

 Food is good. Service is quick. Place is clean. Drinking water is not that good. Though not as bad as fish tank drinking water syndrome."}
{"text":"My first time here I wasn't sure if I liked the decor .  But after trying several appetizers and and sharing three entrees with my boyfriend I was sold. My favorite dish was the pho , I couldnt get enough of it. If you go you must also try the thai iced tea, its amazing. The low low prices were definitely a plus to top everything off. I have returned several times after and enjoyed every visit."}
{"text":"Wok Inn is located in an old Feedbag restaurant. The environment is extremely dated, much like it's predecessor.

The menu includes Thai, Chinese and Vietnamese dishes.  Well, sort of.  The pad Thai is slimy and flavorless.  The pho is made with a meat broth base instead of traditional fish base. The bun is just ok. Not anything to write home about. Especially with the best stuff 15 or so minutes away. I do enjoy the Thai iced tea, but that's not rocket science.

The staff is hit or miss. Sometimes kind and friendly, sometimes patrons seemingly are cramping their lack of style.

Save your money for the good stuff."}
{"text":"It has the ambience of a DMV! Ordered kung pow chicken and got it in  about 1 minute!! You cant tell me that was just cooked!! More or less heated up, no taste! Small portions, nothing really special other then panda is a lot better!! Fast food Chinese that is not good food!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I have come several times. The staff is friendly and quick to serve you. Orders go in and come out hot and fresh. We have tried several appetizers and plates. The menus is not too deep, which I feel means they focus on what they can be great at rather than loose you in a confusing menu. All meals have not disappointed us. Top notch class act and the prices are good too! Come with a appetite as portions are respectable."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to stop in here for a long time now. Finally stopped for lunch on a Sunday. Upon entering we were greeted and seated right away. Upon studying the menu, I noticed there were Chinese, Thai, and Vietnamese choices. I decided on the shrimp lo mein. After ordering, it wasn't too long and our food arrived. My dish looked appetizing and smelled delicious. However, I was disappointed upon my first bite. It was mediocre at best. The noodles were a tad overdone for my liking, and there were only 2 or three pieces of shrimp. The lo mein noodles were tossed with veggies, and sauce. The portion was large. 
The atmosphere was casual, laid back and the service was good. Our waitress was by several times to check on us and refill our sodas. The prices are average. For both of our entrees and sodas it was under  $20. 
All in all my expierence was good."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! I was so sick after I left this place, but it had nothing to do with bad food...I can't believe how fast they got our food out, piping hot, and for an awesome price. $5 for lunch? Yes, please. I ate way too much."}
{"text":"Thai tea was awesome- tasty and refreshing. Establishment area looks interesting from the outside but is well maintained in the inside"}
{"text":"Talk about a restaurant that has quality fresh food at a fantastic price! I have been here twice and would highly recommend it! The restaurant is clean and the staff provide superior customer service! A wonderful environment for a couple or even a family. I will be visiting again when I'm back in the Mesa area! Thank you for such a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"This place is very good. Not the world's best Asian food, but probably the best in the area. The best prices for sure! You get what you pay for in a good way. The food is good, and in this area I feel good Asian food is hard to find so this is probably the best this far East. The service is always extremely great. Everyone is so kind. I love coming here to eat with family."}
{"text":"The reason to come here is the price.  Entrees are priced between $5 and $9 and the portions are generous.  Jasmine tea is $0.75.  Appetizers are $4.  The food came out hot and super fast.  The waitstaff was attentive and polite, and the restaurant itself feels clean.  Parking is plentiful.

BUT.....the taste was very mediocre.  Our party of 5 sampled different dishes and no one was amazed.  The pad-thai was a little vinegary and the orange chicken was unremarkable.  The eggrolls were good.   Despite the average quality of the eats, I might still go back just because can't beat the price (especially for dinner)."}
{"text":"Wok In is one of those unassuming places that doesn't look like much from the street. I was very pleasantly surprised to discover how delicious it is!

The restaurant is very nice and clean. It has been fairly empty when we have gone, but I've just been there at odd hours. The food is very cheap, most items under $6, for a lot of very good flavorful food.

My absolute favorite item on the menu are their potstickers. They absolutely melt in your mouth, and are so delicious. I have liked pretty much everything on the menu so far. It is great to experiment here."}
{"text":"Good food good prices and very clean.  The ingredients all seem to be fresh and prepared well. The staff is friendly and polite.  I've been there on several occasions and have always left happy.  My son is the Pho king and he tells me their Pho is great..  Only problem I could see was the Thai coffee was expensive and the glass was only 3/4 of the way fille up."}
{"text":"Horrible food!!!! Went with two other people, we each only ate one bite and pushed our plates aside. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"If I can rate 0 I would. My first and last time in this place. Salmon was way over cooked that you can't taste it and they covered it with sauce! Yuk! Water served was nasty! Lime slice was dry. Don't go here"}
{"text":"I was impressed here on my first visit, and I will definitely add this spot to my rotation of restaurants.  The prices are really good, based on what I got (Chicken Pho) and taking a peek at other plates that servers were bringing by my booth on their way to other tables.  It was fairly busy for noon on a Saturday, during a holiday weekend in East Mesa.  That's also a good sign. Place was clean, and service was friendly."}
{"text":"Not gonna lie when I say that cheap prices combined with chinese food are a major turn off...damn, it usually is. Typically comparible to that of a cheap motel with bedbugs, cheap booze with a headache, or crap, even a cheap hooker with god knows what (jk on the booze one, lol).

With that said, I must say, this Asian Cusine place called \"Wok In\" did not sell short on any department.

The immediate approach is actually that of a nice, rather large sit-down establishment. More of a dine-in refined restaurant rather than a ToGo counter with pictures of food on the menu wall behing the green counter top you order from. Upon that being said, I was immeditelly greeted by very friendly service. I ordered the \"Chicken Teriyaki Salad\". Not to be mistaken with teriyaki sauce on it however. I asked about it saying \"teriyaki\" with a quick responese the lady and gentleman that helped me explained it was in the style it was cooked, cool, fine, I guess, as long as it tastes good. All the more my stubborn ass still asked for teriyaki sauce on the side. They boasted that the dressing it was accompanied with was very highly liked by their patrons. So I got bot...both on the side. The dressing is stupid good, teriyaki sauce...not so much.

Break-down time! The salad...fresh mixed greens, fresh basil (this was awesome!! Never thought to add basil to a salad, sooo good!) fresh cucumbers, carrots and tomatoes. The chicken was great, all white meat and grilled perfectly, tasted awesome, not dry and not old. The dressing, well let me tell you, even though I have already ...go with their judgement and get the sweet limey stuff...it is awesome. All this joy for only $5.99?? really? I ask? Yup, just about everything on their menu is six bucks, the place is clean , steadily busy and you can seriously grab as many fortune cookies as you want on the way out the door (like butter mints at a steakhouse...yessss). Will and shall return. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Prices are super low, it's clean, has friendly service and yummy dishes! Don't let the area it's in fool you. It's worth it! Just ordered 4 main dishes and an appetizer for $30!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a PF Chang's experience then this is not for you. If you want clean, quiet, friendly atmosphere and good food for less than you'll spend at fast food then you'll love this place."}
{"text":"@it was great, really had a great time, they have a fun look@

+they have a fun look
+really had a great time
+CS is great
+food is great and fully of flavor 
+ nice sit down and have a nice meal with friends and family a like, 
+ I would love to go back and enjoy another meal."}
{"text":"Food was terrible.  Egg rolls mushy, entrees had way too much salt.  Will not go there again."}
{"text":"Strangest hot and sour soup I have ever had anywhere in the World. Sent it back. Pho broth tasted like.Chinese 5 spice. Never have figured out the use for this spice but it ain't for Pho. Vietnamese egg rolls terrible 
 Too bad they prey on old people's lack of taste buds."}
{"text":"Excellent food. I was hesitant at first. I'm normally not keen on venturing out of my comfort zone but my fiancé promised it was worth it. Man was he right. The food is amazing and the prices are even better"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place !! Really impressed. Food was fresh, & delicious, and not overwhelming.  Thai tea was actually made. Not out of a can. You will not be disappointed. Prices are rwasonable."}
{"text":"We were Antique shopping and Yelp'd this location, so we decided to try it out. We will definitely be back! The prices were very inexpensive and the meals were delicious. We had Spring Rolls, Pot Stickers, Orange Chicken and the Pho. Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"For the price and portions, this place is a steal. A hidden gem really! The food is so good! Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Like what they say the place is really clean and the waiters are friendly and courteous. I finally found my cravings for Vietnamese egg rolls called Goi Cuon. My wife commented, \"I like eating new kinds of food with you!\" I am glad she like it. We also enjoyed the crab angels. Reasonable price for main dish $4.99. The servings are just right and enough."}
{"text":"For $5 an entree this place can't be beat. Good food, friendly and fast service. I had the spicy Thai noodles and they're just as good as anything you'd pay for at another competing restaurant. Great place for a cheap, friendly, low pressure meal of good quality"}
{"text":"With all the Five star reviews I expected way way better...I have to believe most of those reviewers have a crack habit.

Yes it's cheap but its also cheap.  The old slogan \"You get what you pay for\" applies heavily here.

Was it gross and disgusting. No.  Was it flavorful and delicious, No.

The only thing redeeming was the Pho Broth.

The Lo Mein was like spaghetti with some veggies and sad looking shrimp in it.

The Fried Rice looked and tasted awful.

Lose the Fusion and make a decision."}
{"text":"First off I just like to point out that I am Vietnamese and I have very high standards for our Vietnamese soup (pho). When I first walked in this place it is very big and clean, I was truly impressed compare to other Vietnamese places I been to. I ordered the Thai tea and beef pho. My first tasting of the pho broth, I have to say it's pretty good, I'm not going to say it is the best but it has all the key ingredients that make what it is. The Thai tea is good but all places I had them they will always taste the same. I'm very impressed by how clean this place is and pricing. Will be coming back soon. 4.5 stars"}
{"text":"Not too bad for local Chinese food near AJ. Will satisfy your basic craving. Don't expect anything exotic. 

The orange chicken was too orange tasting, i have to admit Panda Express is better on this dish.

The other dish i tried was Pad Thai, it was ok too. Good enough for a short drive from AJ, but ive had better near Gilbert Road and 60.. 

Clean restaurant, free fortune cookie in a basket for your taking and toothpicks."}
{"text":"I love this place and live nearby so I go a lot! It's a great place of you want good cheap food. I thought it was too good to be true when everything on the menu was about $5 but the Thai iced tea, potstickers, basil rice, and orange chicken are delicious. Gave it only four starts because not everything is delicious... Good... Just not delicious, but for $5 not bad. Our favorite thing to do is buy the party size potstickers... 40 for $25."}
{"text":"Service: 5 star
Food: 1 Star (redeemed by their Vietnamese fare else negative)
Mom and Pop store: Check
Price: Cheap
= 4 star

I would have given this  a 2 star at most if it wasn't for the service. Their Chinese Kung pao was dreadful (sweet and tough chicken). I should have stuck with the Vietnamese spread (but had pre-ordered from their online menu). The service was really good and the place was really clean and almost \"American\" diner looking."}
{"text":"Love this place! Th efood is cheap and VERY Yummy. Reminds me of PF changs but half the cost."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great. This is a nice Asian restaurant with a modest menu at a good price. I came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. The staff was courteous and prompt. I ordered the Thai basil noodle dish with tofu. This was made with rice noodles and vegetables. Your options are tofu, chicken, beef, or just the vegetables. This dish is listed on the menu as spicy. I had to add a generous amount of chili sauce to spice it up otherwise it was pretty bland. I also thought the noodles were slightly overcooked and sticky. Overall the meal was a good deal for the generous amount of food. A big bowl for under$10.00."}
{"text":"We decided to give this place a try based on prior reviews.  The first thing we noticed upon arrival in the parking lot was a horrible smell of rotten food coming from the dumpster area.  Prices are low and the staff is pleasant.  The menu is limited.  Crab angels were well flavored but cold.  Orange chicken was overpoweringly citrusy.  Vegetable lomein was unremarkable."}
{"text":"Just moved in the area and was craving Asian food. Was pleasant surprised by this place. Very clean, courteous staff, great prices, and good food. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here and was very pleasantly surprised. Lo mein & shrimp pad Thai were delicious. Not overly saucy, salty, or greasy like some Chinese can be. Very fresh ingredients. Friendly & fast service & prices are great!"}
{"text":"First off, I definitely wouldn't consider this place a \"Thai\" restaurant, as it's stated on Yelp. They may make Thai dishes, but it's certainly not authentic lol

I came in for take-out for my family, and the location was very spacious and clean. They had a \"open\" kitchen for you to see, and it appeared clean in there.

The highlight of the dishes I ordered was the Thai Spicy Crispy Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken, and Beef Sate. All the meats were tender and meaty (e.g. more chicken than batter), but nothing was crispy and that's not Wok In's fault--I imagine if we dined in, the meats would've still been crispy when it came right out of the kitchen. 

For the price of the dishes, I was impressed with what was served. I'm definitely coming back to dine-in to take in the just-cooked experience."}
{"text":"Un expensive,  clean and great owner service. The Vietnamese food was good, Thai tea little to sweet and to much cream but tasty."}
{"text":"It is always rough with non-chain locations to review them poorly, but this restaurant did multiple things that were wrong.  First off our order was written down incorrectly to where we didn't receive an appetizer that we wanted and the time between ordering, food, and check was fairly long.  I think it took us over an hour to complete the process.  It didn't seem all that busy, but maybe they had a new employee and we will probably come back eventually to give it another try, but from our first impression we weren't impressed."}
