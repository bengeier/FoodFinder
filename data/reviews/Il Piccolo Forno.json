{"text":"Best Cannoli & sfoglia cakes! Always Taste delicious & fresh, even when they are super busy (which they always are) and you can't beat the price-especially since I find that where some bakeries charge extra for \"premium\" flavours, you get as standard here. Down to earth, great family business- and authentic! Love it!"}
{"text":"My Italian coworker took me to this place during lunch and let me tell that it was a great choice. The here is and authentic mom & pop Italian hot table and pastries and espresso bar shop.   The place is run by Dad and Mom with their two daughters... which creates a very family friendly environment. There is plenty of seating inside and parking outside.   For lunch I ordered their pasta with ros√© sauce which came with vegetables. Wow it the sauce (homemade) was sooooooo goooood! I was even dipping the vegetables as well. To top it all up I also  ordered Espresso Machiatto, I would have to say this is as close to Italy as I can get. The strong coffee is smooth even without any sugar and very enjoyable.  Over all very good experience and easy on the pocket."}
{"text":"Great authentic Italian hot table and pastries. Friendly family run joint.  Had a great espresso and fresh cannoli"}
{"text":"Reliably good Tavola calda (hot table, serving chicken and veal parm with sides of pasta and vegetables). Homemade flavour and home style service. It's a small, unassuming place in Vaughan but the real thing when it comes to Italian food. The cream-filled cannoli are some of the best in the city (Toronto or Vaughan) and the coffee is proper. This place sets the standard for a classic Italian lunch on a busy schedule."}
{"text":"The best family run bakery in the GTA! You will never try another Sfoglia cake again until you try Salvatore's! Known for freshness and quality! Just purchased my 6th cake from Il Piccolo Forno! Always a hit!"}
{"text":"Everyone here (and at the store) was raving about the cannoli but YOU HAVE TO TRY THE TIRAMISU.......I WAS SOLD AND IN LOVE.  The cannolis in my honest opinion, were mediocre. They were a bit too heavy and bland. The two cheesecakes that i got - strawberry and caramel were delicious. Chocolate cream puff, like the cannolis, were a bit too unflavourful.   Mixed feelings for their desserts, but the Tiramisu made it up. I will go back one day and buy all the Tiramisus they have."}
{"text":"Best sfoglia cake in the GTA. So glad a friend turned me on to this place. So reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"They hands down make the best veal sandwiches, very cheap compared to others $7.50 includes 3 toppings, the bread is fresh, and hot peppers, mushrooms, and they don't have provolone but instead use mozzarella.  It's a mom and pap bakery with the family running it. The mother and father are so kind, but the 3 girls behind the counter are selfishly rude with no customer service skills, sometimes racist if you are not Italian, believe me hate to say it but seen it happen many times. Anyways I don't mind as I just there for my Veal sandwich."}
