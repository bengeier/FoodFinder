{"text":"This is probably my favorite place on State Street.  The food is reasonably priced and very healthy.  Lots of fantastic vegetarian options, and out door seating in the summer."}
{"text":"When I visited Madison I ate here everyday for a few days. This is one of the best Nepali restaurants I have been to. I have tried several dishes from the menu. I loved farsi ko tarkari and chicken ko masu. Dal here is my favorite.  I even asked for recipe. I tried making it at home but it wasn't the same :( Great atmosphere, super friendly people, healthy and delicious food!"}
{"text":"My first time trying Nepalese cuisine and I am not a vegetarian but really enjoyed a sans meat night.  Loved the Mango Lassi, roti and Samosas!"}
{"text":"The momochas, tarkaris and dal are always fantastic.  Only take cash or checks, and the ATM across the street was taken down, so the nearest free ATM is a few blocks away.  Have to be prepared for that."}
{"text":"I felt this place was a little overrated. Being something of a fan of Nepalese food, I found this place over-vegetarian and under-spiced, and the service was a bit slow.   Still, it's a nice alternative to the beer-and-brats fare of the Great North."}
{"text":"One of my top 3 favorite restaurants in Madison.  I love the dumplings, beef buff and whole wheat flatbread! Very reasonably priced.  A hole in the wall secret in Madison."}
{"text":"This place was tasty and rich, and it seems like a good place to visit especially when it gets cold outside.  I had the vegetarian combination platter, and it came with samosas, momochas, roti, and dal. Overall, it was pretty good. The samosas and roti were particularly good, and the momochas could have been a bit more flavorful. I will probably try the momos if I go back.   The main reason this place lost a star was the portions for the price. The meal sizes were perfect for me, but I generally eat very small meals. The average person may be left wanting more than just one entree. Perhaps adding a side would make it a larger, better suited meal. Also, if you don't feel like going vegetarian, be prepared to pay over 15 per entree.   Overall, I would come back. This was my first time trying Nepali food and it was really good. I want a stack of that roti for my breakfast every day."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I worked here '95-'98   I love Himal Chuli. Bishnu and Jamuna has been making some of the best food in the world (to me) \"with love\" for many years. They would always tell me that was why it was so good - because she cooked \"with love\" ;) I have noticed their proces have risen dramatically, but that will not keep me from eating there when I am in town. It is hard to say what the \"best\" menu item is, because everything is sooooo incredibly good. A few of my favorites are the daal (yellow lentil soup), daily takari (vegetarian stew) and roti (yoghurt leavened flatbread), the chicken or tofu polungo (lightly breaded chicken with a tomato based sauce containing spinach and mushrooms), the momo/momcha (dumplings), chicken sikar (fall-off-the-bone chicken and sauce), beef buff (beef with cumin/coriander, sauted with broccoli)... and really I dont think there is a single thing I dont like on the menu! Get some golub jamun and a lasi for desert ;)"}
{"text":"yes, I crave this food when I visit my alma mater in madison, wisconsin. For a city of its size, Madison has a diverse food experience and what I contribute my love for ethnic food.  I love the dal, roti, and choice of tarkari of the day. I also love their momos!  I have to admit that I have not eaten one meat dish. This place is very small and probably has only about 7 tables... The food sometimes takes awhile, but it always arrives hot and clearly homemade."}
{"text":"*Great* place.  Went here while visiting Madison (beat the students flooding into the city by just two days).  Food was very well made, authentic-tasting (though, for the record, it's only my second time eating Nepalese food), and very healthy.  Service was at the speed of mom-and-pop shop, not conveyor belt -- that's either good or bad depending on your preference.  Unfrortunately I can't remember the names of the dishes to describe them in detail, but I can say this: mango lasse (South Asian milkshake) made from fresh mangoes.  Y. U. M."}
{"text":"So good I went back three times in one night....  First time was to eat, based on server recommendations that were spot on. But I didnt realize it was cash only. So I left my book about Tesla as collateral while I went to an ATM. Two ATMs later I returned to pay, and left without a receipt (which I needed for business expense) and the book. It was quite comical by the third time in, butbthey were patient with me.  The coffee is excellent... Very good Momocha, as was the jackfruit dish Katahar Kabob. Excellent service and clean bathrooms. All around great experience."}
{"text":"Man, I love the HC aces. Have eaten there a half-dozen times and always happy, esp. with the vegetarian dishes. And people are nice there. The world needs more Himalayan food."}
{"text":"This place is great. I was here on Wednesday night, when there seemed to be only one waitress and water too many tables for weeknight. She handled it so well though. We were checked on frequently and our entrees came out at a decent time despite how bust our waitress must have been. If you're feeling adventurous, try to the momocha. It's great as an appetizer! My only complaint is that the prices are a little too high considering the amount of food you receive. There isn't enough for left overs, even though most entrees are in the $16 range. Otherwise, it's a spectacular place!"}
{"text":"Point to note: It's cash only.  My friends would think I'm the weird one. I seem to be the one amongst them who like this the most. I really do! It's one of those places where both indoor and outdoor seating appeal to me. It's cosy indoors, with the light fragrance of food coming from the kitchen. Who can resist sitting outside overlooking state st?   Combination platter is a good way to start if you're there for the first time. It has a little of everything: 2 momochas (dumplings), 1 samosa, roti and a cup of dal. Dal is nicely spiced and served warm. Roti is fresh and goes well with the refreshing yoghurt dip.   Meat lovers: chicken sikar and lamb sikar are nice options.   Recommend going for dinner. They have the same menu for lunch so price wise it's expensive relatively for lunch considering most places on state st offers lunch specials. Service is slow, usually one or two waiter takes care of everything. I visit when I'm not in any particular hurry so it's ok. But come prepared."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious! I've been eating here for years, and the flavors in every dish are amazing. Large vegetarian menu, unusual dishes, efficient waitstaff. My only complaint: portions for some items can be small, especially given the price. One of the last real restaurants on a street of unappealing chain restaurants."}
{"text":"Ok at best, their dal was edible. The samosas were awful, the tarkari was very bland, I suppose that's the norm for nepal. The momos were bathed in mild salsa. A very odd experience. The place is cool, the service is goodish, but my roti even arrived logged in broth."}
{"text":"This was the first time I've eaten Nepalese food, and was a good thing to start on. The food and service was great. The only thing I've found a problem was the portions, for the price. Remember however, this is not Mc Donald's, and is a very nice restaurant. Not everything is super sized people. Over all, if your not STARVING, this is a good place to try. I recommend the momo and dal."}
{"text":"I went for dinner the other day. While the food was good, I wouldn't go out of my way to go back here to eat. We ate outside after seeing the dining room and how close the tables were to one another.  the dal: ok, nothing special IMO momochas: good, but not as flavorful as I had expected Tarkara of the day: I wish it had more sauce so there was something to dip the roti into  The food seemed to be made with care and portions were satisfying (not enough for leftovers). The service was nothing special, but it was prompt."}
{"text":"OMG! This is the best food ever! We eat every meal at Himal Chuli when we visit Madison.  We share the Momocha and the Samosa's every time and I usually order the special. They have a gift for making healthy food taste amazing! The food is exceptionally tasty and consistent every time. The family who owns the restaurant is super nice and courteous. You can tell that the food is made with great energy."}
{"text":"Himal chuli is definitely one of my favorite places to eat in Madison. I have been frequenting this fine restaurant for the past 9 years and have never been disappointed. In fact I often crave their momochas - steamed vegetable dumplings flavored with peanut sauce and served in a tomato-coriander sauce (my favorite!). The menu has many options for vegetarians and meat eaters. While I am a meat lover to the bone, I prefer their vegetarian entrees. I am also a huge fan of their whole wheat roti. The family who runs the restaurant is very friendly and provides excellent service. Whether you are a long time resident of Madison or just passing through, I highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a fresh meal with distinctive ethnic flavor and a warm atmosphere.."}
{"text":"Luckily, we went to dinner here on a beautiful night so we were able to eat outside.  Even though they were short staffed for servers, our meal came out hot and fast.  The food was delicious and fresh.  The vegetarian menu had more entr√©es than the meat menu so we all order a vegetarian meal.  They were so authentic and tasty.    It was also fun people watching on a Saturday evening on state street!"}
{"text":"We actually drive from Chicago with this restaurant top on our must-do list. I've been coming here since the 1990s, and it means so much to me that the place is as just as great now as it was then.The food is simple, wholesome yet compelling in its combinations. The roti (bread) is perfect, the combos offered of a main dish and dahl are heaven."}
{"text":"I guess I can't comment on authenticity as this is the only place I've ever eaten Nepali food.  But it tastes great, you'll find nothing like it anywhere else in Madison...its relatively healthy and its not a chain...just a comfy, small place on State St. that you should visit...soon!"}
{"text":"Great vegetarian options, subtle and delightful flavored. Colorful and cozy. The dal soup is an inviting beginning to the meal. After the meal it is so hard to choose just one of the desserts, especially for those who enjoy cardamom flavor."}
{"text":"We originally planned to go to Chautara sadly we found out they had closed.  So we ended up going Himal chuli next door.  We ordered an appetizer, 2 entrees and ended up paying 50 dollars. Portions were small, very plain, and I was still hungry.  Hell, my half blind grandpa cooks better coon than i done ate here. We ended up going for a slice of pizza from Ian's pizza place afterwards to fill us up.  yeah, we can eat.  so? There was only one waiter and he was efficient and cordial."}
{"text":"this place comprises the sum total of my experience with nepalese food, but by any standard it is delicious.  i am a carnivore and they do have meat, but i never stray from madison's best vegetarian dishes.  the takari changes daily and all are good.  also rock himal's combo platter. flatbread is the platonic ideal.  salad dressing is also addictive."}
{"text":"Super authentic and run by the sweetest people. We stop here every time we come through Madison. Highly recommend this place for an authentic taste and feel of Nepal!"}
{"text":"The food here is really delicious but way overpriced. I could stand the high prices if the portions were big, but they're not - in fact, they're tiny. And I'm not one of those people who demand outsized American-style portions large enough to feed three people either. But $13.95 for what appears to be a half-order size of a dish made up of tofu and vegetables, really? Did you know tofu is cheap?   I used to live in NYC where I would get equally good Himalayan food (see Cafe Himalaya in the East Village) that was half as cheap with portions twice as big. Did I mention this was in overpriced New York City!!! I think Himal Chuli would see much more traffic if they changed up their business model a bit--more food with cheaper prices. This is a college town, after all."}
{"text":"I originally wanted the chili chicken, but they said they were out.  They didn't make it, so I opted for something a little different.  I had the Katahar Kabab - Green jackfruit marinated with a special blend of Nepali spices and sauteed with onions, tomatoes, and cilantro.  The menu said this is a meat substitute commonly served at Nepali weddings.  Served with choices of rice or roti and dal or tossed salad.   Jackfruit is interesting.  It has a consistency like an artichoke heart.  This wasn't my favorite dish, though this place is worthy of a second visit to try some of the other dishes and see if they can add another star to the rating."}
{"text":"Amazing! Of all of the places in downtown, I'm glad I chose this place. Super friendly staff (this is the Midwest, after all) and a cozy ambience makes this a place worth returning to many times over. My meal was delicious and fast.  Worth a trip if you are curious"}
{"text":"I am a Nepali and I am really disappointed with their food. Went there because of the good review but to tell the truth, never had this kind of Nepali food in my life. The only good thing was hot pickle. I don't like to give bad reviews but this is not what I was expecting from a Nepali Restaurant."}
{"text":"Great, great authentic nepali food, which i've found extremely difficult to procure the real stuff in madison.  The fact that when i go in there and see a family run operation, with the nepalese grandmother at the helm in the kitchen is a great sign.  The smell upon entering is also a fantastic sign of things to come.  I would say that portions aren't huge, but with daal included on most items (it is simple, delicious and hearty) you won't leave hungry.  Everything is spiced just right, and cooled properly with yogurt sauces and their perfectly crafted, slightly crisp basmati rice.  The jackfruit, while it seems an odd entree is fantastic, slightly sour, very substantial, and of course, spiced just right.  It really is the rice here that makes the food here fantastic.  Nothing is worse that having fantastic entrees with flavorful sauces, only to have to soak it up with nasty, gluey, and mushy rice.  Any sort of wait here is worth the food."}
{"text":"The best Indian restaurant that I have even been too. Try Kathal bhartha, baingan bharta, kadhi, cold chilly chicken and lamb rosh curry. As I grabbed the first bite it just flash backed to the memory I have in my mind straight away to home. Great food. try the chicken momo's. They are just icing over the cake."}
{"text":"This is a small, fab place on State St. The food was so excellent!  While we were waiting for our meal, we were given small bowls of dal which were delicious! The samosas were a little tough but very good. There are more vegetarian/vegan options than not. How refreshing! Friendly service. We had a late lunch or I'm sure it would have been packed. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Hi, on my first day exploring Madison, I noticed this small (yes a tad bit like a hole in the wall) but charming Nepali restaurant. It was late afternoon (sun coming down) and like any foodie would know, if a place is packed and busy with tables full and people standing with no room, it's probably a good place to eat! I strolled inside and looked over everyone's plates and my first thoughts were \"gosh these plates are small\", similar to a lot of the posters on yelp. I took a look at the menu to see what was on there and yes, I to concur - sticker shock!! Anyhow, even after reading the yelp reviews, I decided to give it a try anyways because it looked delicious! Yes, and I am so glad I did! I ordered takeout.  I got the Momos (half veg, half non-veg). I am used to lighter dumplings and these were on the chunkier side but good. The sauce that comes with it is ok and the hot sauce I asked for is spicy(!) and dry but tasty!   I got the Katahar Kebab, the green jackfruit dish and it is delicious. I don't know what they did to the jackfruit but definitely good things. The vegetable sauce is tasty.  Lastly, the dal was the best - definitely one of the best I've had! They put a couple or so different beans in there and it's soo good. Warm and comforting! I did a taste test of everything first when I started and the dal, I ate it up all in the beginning. Sooo soo good. Just the comfort food I needed. :-)   I also got the special himal chuli coffee and the sweet lady behind the register made it when I got there to pick up my food. It was the perfect touch to end a great meal.  I would definitely recommend Himal Chuli. It may seem like a splurge considering the decor but actually a $9 appetizer and $16 entree with soup isn't much different than what I would pay at a thai, chinese, italian or american restaurant."}
{"text":"I always enjoy a meal from the heart. This restaurant truly impressed me. Great service delicious well seasoned fresh ingredients and awesome taste. The dal is great and I can't wait to bring my friends here soon."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place to eat in Madison. Inexpensive, delicious and very friendly staff. Always feel relaxed and happy after eating here. The chef's choice tarkari and roti is always a sure thing"}
{"text":"They provide excellent veg. fare. The food tasted great. Many of the items on the menu including the somosa were not available. Three of the six deserts were not available. The dishes are pricy, a non-veg dish costs about $14.75, while at comparable restaurants that would be in the $9.95 range. They do not accept credit cards."}
{"text":"My first time trying Nepalese food, stopped in on a friend's very enthusiastic rec. Ordered the Seitan Buff with roti and dal -- all good, especially the roti. Although I don't typically order brothy soups, I'd eat the dal again (creamier when stirred). The cherry tomato hiding in the seitan dish was a little flavor bomb, wish there'd been more! Wonder if I can order extra tomatoes next time..."}
{"text":"People who don't give this gem of a restaurant 5 stars must be out of their minds.  Service: amazing. We ordered, got our food quickly and our check came  at just the right time. Also, as a customer service connoisseur I can tell you that the waitress (there is only one) has talent. We've been in town for 3 days and eaten there 3 times. The waitress remembers my dietary restrictions and makes suggestions to accommodate (she remembered which beer my boyfriend ordered too!).  The food: fresh, wholesome, the flavors are zesty and concise. Everything is made in an open kitchen with obvious care. These people pride themselves on you enjoying the food they create. Atmosphere: its a small place, maybe 12 tables. Simply decorated, good lighting from the front windows, clean.   Other notes: I've seen some Yelp reviews where people complained about prices, but I would argue that for 10-15 dollars plate, you could do much worse. You get what you pay for here: real food prepared with care.  I've also seen complaints about portion size. Ach- people expect gross portions in the Midwest, get over it people! This is an adequate portion.  Also, if you are vegan or gluten free or both, you have just found the promise land. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I have been a loyal customer of this restaurant for almost two decades. Overall the restaurant itself and the food have changed little over the years, if at all, but as the saying goes if it ain't broke don't fix it. Most recently I dined her two days in a row because I was attending a work conference downtown. The restaurant typically has two specials of the day, so I was able to try them both. The interior of the restaurant is small so when it's a nice day out I prefer sitting outside. Our waiter was very friendly and provided great service. He explained he was helping his grand parents run the restaurant.  The food itself is fresh and light, not greasy or heavy. This makes for a tasty, healthy meal. The vegetables are not overcooked and they offer side options of rice, brown rice or flat bread. The dal soup is also tasty. They also serve chiya tea and lassi yoghurt drinks.    Overall this restaurant is a Madison staple and I recommend it to anyone seeking good ethnic cuisine."}
{"text":"Himal Chuli is the sister restaurant to Chuatara and also happens to be the better one IMO. I don't know how traditional/authentic it is, but the food is light, tasty, and flavorful, and as a massive meat eater, I can say that they have some of the best vegetarian food I've ever eaten (most places are just too bland or funky).  Surprisingly enough, for a restaurant with such a strong vegetarian emphasis, they do have good meat dishes. My biggest issue with this place is the price -- they seriously could charge a little less... $9 for the amount of food served was hardly a bargain and $15 for the meat stuff? Ouch.   Atmosphere is cosy and quaint -- It's kinda quiet and bright and you get a nice view of State Street when you're sitting there."}
{"text":"I dream about this place... Everytime I visit Madison I go back and everytime I am more than satisfied.  Even on the menu it says their food is made with love and good energy!  I always order the sampler platter thingy because I loves the samosas!"}
{"text":"Very good flavor! Hits the spot! The bean soup was amazing! I also had the chicken dish that was very tasty!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and food. We ordered the momo, Hyala (Bison-stew) and Chicken Buff. It was the perfect meal after racing the local 70.3. The momo was hand-made, and both entrees were fresh and light. (I remember pretty heavy food last time I was in Kathmandu, and this was authentic with a fresher twist on it). Great ambience and well worth the price. I would definitely come here again. :)"}
{"text":"I love you Himal Chuli!  Great for vegetarians, meat eaters and curry fanatics.  I'm friends with the chefs and I appreciate being close enough to see them. At some point, I lost a balloon in the tall ceilings. You might want to watch out."}
{"text":"This is good food that leaves also leaves you feeling nourished, but not weighed down. Talked with owners son once, apparently it's one of not many places on state street that are still left from the 70s. The daal, in particular shouldn't be missed. The peanut dumplings, kali takari, and the fragrant asparagus dish they have in the spring are worth trying too."}
{"text":"Some of the best food in madison!!!! We get the tarkari, roti, & dal which are very very reasonably priced. The service is great & we always leave with happy tummys."}
{"text":"I convinced a friend to tag along with me and eat at this place after reading inspiring reviews on Yelp! The restaurant is situated right on State Street near the junction and wasn't difficult to find. It's quite tiny and overcrowded inside with small tables jammed into over corner and along the walls (we didn't sit out because it was a hot day), and definitely doesn't win marks for decor. The food was simple and mild flavored, though it did taste very home-made. We ordered rotis and a chicken entree (I forget the name now), which I thought was quite over-priced at $17 plus. I loved the dal and the cauliflower side dish special for that day, so much that I ordered the entree portion of the cauliflower dish later on (again, overpriced for a veg dish IMO). Being Indian, we identified quite easily with the menu choices and ingredients, which was a plus while eating out with my food-fussy at times-vegan friend. Do order the mango lassi - the drink totally made our meal complete and we didn't feel the need for ordering desserts.  All in all, we were not singing praises of the place as we were leaving. Our meal (with no starters nor desserts) came up to about $35 with tips. If you're not into heavy, greasy, spicy Indo-Asian food, then this is the place to go to! For some reason, it did remind me of a home-cooked meal (no dish is mild flavored where I come from in India), albeit a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"Great little gem on State Street! They are nine small tables and the only take cash, but the food is AMAZING. Especially good vegetarian dishes (and that's coming from a devoted omnivore). Make sure to stop in."}
{"text":"Only to confirm and re-confirm that this is one of my favorite restaurants in the world. A gem on State Street keeping affordable prices as they take cash only. Amazing and delicious food with ample vegetarian selections. I've been a fan of their Cauli tarkari for over fifteen years now. A tarkari with roti and dal is always a great meal. There sample platter is another good option as are the momochi. Family-owned, with attentive service and a true appreciation for good and nourishing food."}
{"text":"The food is terrific!  I was visiting Madison for a conference, and a group of us stumbled in here for dinner. The service was nice, not too slow, and the server didn't mind giving us suggestions for dinner. We did what they said and had a terrific and filling meal!  The food is something like Indian, but not quite. And it's not the same as Tibetan, but close. If you like Indian and Tibetan food, though, you'll like this.  Only 4 stars because of there atmosphere: there is none. Price is pretty good, though. We all eat very well for $25 each, including a nice tip."}
{"text":"Wonderful food.  Great, albiet, slow service.  Open kitchen with old grandmother handmaking everything.  I have been going to Himal Chuli for years, and I just can't stop loving this place. The ambiance is dingy and the entrees are overpriced, but I keep on returning because it's THAT GOOD.   Side Note: Don't bother with meat entrees. The real gems are in the majority vegetarian selections."}
{"text":"Thank you.  Thank you thank you thank you.  I'll let the other reviews talk about the cuisine.  I'm not well-enough versed in Nepalese to really get into it.  I will say this:  the textures, the flavors, the quality of ingredients.  Wonderful.  Simply wonderful.  Please do not think my review (and the rare 4 stars) is because I live in a gastronomic desert.  I do, I admit it.  But the food here is absolutely wonderful.  Not only that, but the size of the place, the hole-in-the-wall ambiance, and the cash-only policy allowed me to pretend, for half an hour, I was in New York City.  Your mom says you should eat at Himal Chuli, and so do I."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  Tons of vegetarian options, but you can do meat too.  I got a tofu dish and vegetarian mo mo as an appetizer.  The dishes come with rice or dal.  I got the dal, it was amazing.  I couldn't believe how delicious everything was.   The waitress was super nice, and the woman at the counter was very sweet.  Very attentive, very fast.    The food was delicious, and the price is right.  Definitely a favorite!"}
{"text":"Best momos and momochas I have ever had................this place is a bit of an institution on State Street.   Worth the visit."}
{"text":"This was a college favorite restaurant for me. I'd never heard of Nepalese/Himalayan food when I discovered it, but I quickly became a fan. I visited it again after 16 years and it was still excellent. The food has some things in common with Indian food, but other dishes are entirely unique. The place is tiny -  a handful of tables in a little room, but clean and decorated with Buddhist art. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful. The restaurant serves beer, which is an improvement over the past. I had the vegetarian Momocha (steamed dumplings) and an order of roti. Both were hot, fresh and as good as I recalled. Please note though - it's cash only, so come prepared."}
{"text":"My favorite Madison restaurant... fresh local ingredients. The dal kicks butt! Don't miss the momocha... YUM!"}
{"text":"Outstanding momos and vegetarian tarkari!! Samosas were delicious too. So happy we stopped in.  The tarkari had a wonderful flavor with fresh veggies. No wait to sit down and friendly and fast staff!! Wish this place was in our hometown."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The Dahl is amazing.  The samosas are the best I've had.  Not greasy.  This is the kind of place you can eat out and almost all the choices are healthy.  The large number of vegetarian entrees are wonderful.  The daily specials (tarkari) are so good.  My favorite is the Cauli.  The salad is great.  Never had the meat dishes, but I hear they're good too.  If I could only pic two restaurant to visit for the rest of my life, it would be here and Lao Laan Xang."}
{"text":"Tourist heaven. Healthy and unique food in the center of Madison. Amazing momosha! Friendly and fast service, lots of happy people eating there. Very low key, informal, and delicious. Not cheap but worth it."}
{"text":"This was a pretty legit spot to grab authentic Nepalese food.  I was on a long road trip from DC to Minneapolis and made sure to make a pit stop in Madison.  This is a cash-only spot but I think the food is legit and the prices are reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"Himal Chuli has potential. The mysterious eyes on the restaurant's front door are a replica of what is painted on a major Buddhist temple in Kathmandu.   It is very cool that the servers take their pouring skills seriously: they basically hold a water pitcher sky high and the water comes cascading into your glass perfectly. This is a Nepalese cultural tradition I have observed before.   I am also impressed by the dal soup. It is flavorful, without ever being watery, but does not have that gross consistency of split pea soup. Our server was also kind and pleasant, ready to help us at any moment.  The rest of the food is just so-so. The name momos (cute name for dumplings) cannot mask the fact that they are just dull-tasting. Whatever chicken and vegetable dish I ordered had its bitter, blase moments.  But then again, I am spoiled, having actually traveled to Nepal to dine on authentic, native food, so of course the cuisine even replicated in the US is going to come up short to me."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Madison restaurant and I always feel I need to visit when I am in town.  Today was a beautiful fall afternoon and I sat outside for a small lunch of samosas and dal.  It was a perfect little meal for such a gorgeous day.  The dal is comforting and I have always loved the unexpected pairing of samosas with yogurt and cranberry sauces, then topped with carrot shavings."}
{"text":"I've only eaten at Himal Chuli 3 or 4 times, but I've never been disappointed. They've altered their menu a bit since my last visit making even more dishes vegan. Tonight I had Today's Tarkari 1/2 and 1/2 (Saag and Cauli) w/ Roti and Dal. All was excellent!  I'll be back next trip to Madison."}
{"text":"MMM just saying the name brings back the best food memories a girl can carry with her on this long journey called life.  I have spent many a wonderful winter and summer evening in this little cozy nook of a restaurant.  It is small and seating is tight inside, but the colors and Nepali decor are so warm and inviting.  This is by far one of my most missed dining experiences in Madison.    I never even knew I liked Nepalese or any variation of Indian food, until I was taken here by one of my best friends.  It has now become a ritual whenever I visit.    The Roti ahhh salty and warm, the dal ahh the perfect blend of warmth, spice and flavor.  I typically stick the the usual dish of Chicken Buff which never disappoints and like to end the meal with the Cinnamon Lassi.  For the vegetarian's out there this place has many options without meat.  If you haven't tried it, go now!  I promise you will not regret it.  Just remember to take cash or a checkbook as they don't take cards."}
{"text":"Very simple homemade type of food...simplicity at its best. No credit/debit cards accepted"}
{"text":"After spending some time in Nepal recently, I was hankering for some good ole Dal Bhat upon my return to Madison. I decided to check out Himal Chuli, and I left with my Nepali craving mostly satisfied. I was kind of disappointed they didn't have a Nepali Thali set since I basically lived off of that in Nepal, but I eventually settled on the chef's choice tarkari (curried vegetables) and dal (lentils). Both were tasty, but they just weren't the same as in Nepal. The roti was much thicker  than I found in Nepal and the spice combo didn't seem quite as magical as I remembered. This could have been in part due to the absence of a majestic, mountainous background, or due to the fact that the price was 5 times the 300 nepali rupees I would have paid for the same meal in Nepal. Either way I'm probably being a bit unfair so overall I would say my experience, though not entirely authentic, warrants 4-stars."}
{"text":"From personal experience (2 weeks in Nepal in 2008), even above-average meals in Nepal are nowhere near as good as what you get at Himal Chuli. That being said, the prices at this Madison gem are shockingly high. It is not so much that I expect \"ethnic\" food to be cheap (I do not), but that the location, ambience, and portion sizes do not match the price tag.  If you can ignore the prices, the food is a real treat. The momos are delicious (sadly, there is no pan fried variety on the menu), the dal divine, and the roti flavorful. Fortunately, my wife ordered the combination platter which allowed me to sample the mimochas (very good). I opted for the stewed jackfruit accompanied by 4 slices of whole wheat roti. I had not had cooked jackfruit before but dare say that I am a fan. It tastes almost like an artichoke heart but denser and larger.   Himal Chuli is well worth your while if you are not overly price sensitive and hankering after some good Nepalese food."}
{"text":"It has been over 30 years since I last ate here! The wait person said nothing has changed but it has and it has not. Still a nice small shop. Seating are very close to one another especially in the alcove near the door. Decorations were dated for sure. Prices have gone up for sure too.   Nevertheless, food quality remains simple and tasty. My partner had the chicken sikar and I had the hyala. The chicken sikar was tasty. The sauce on the chicken is even better. Since there wasn't enough sauce, we asked for more and they obliged by cooking just the sauce. That's service!  Hyala is a soup Mader's with minced bison meat. I can't tell the difference between that and minced beef of pork. The soup is made with fresh ingredients and has a clear broth. There is also a certain fragrant that I can't pinpoint. A pleasant one though.   Anyway, as others have noted, this is a cash or check place. No CC. Maybe Yelp can have a special icon for these places. A small, decent restaurant tucked into the middle of state st. I probably won't be returning anytime soon but I hope it won't be another 30 years."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying this is a cash only restaurant. I don't have any problems with that, but it's good to know before you get there.   It's a fairly small restaurant on State Street with both indoor and outdoor seating. The food is Nepalese/Himalayan. There is a large number of vegetarian options and a smaller number of meat options. Prices are not bad, but portion sizes are slightly smaller than you might expect. Our waiter was friendly and helpful. The service was fine.  Our group of three tried the Himal Combination Platter which includes: two momochas, one samosa, roti and a cup of dal. We also had the Chicken Sikar which was chicken w/spices, garlic, and onion; and Katahar Kabob which is green jackfruit with spices and sauteed with onion, tomatoes, and cilantro. All of the dishes were very mild; the spices very low-key. I didn't really enjoy the jackfruit as I found the texture a cross between eggplant and tofu but I did like the opportunity to try it.   I've been to Himal Chuli several times in the past years. All my experiences have been similar. I enjoy the opportunity to try a food I'm not particularly familiar with, but I just don't think it has much flavor. If you are looking for something different this is a good place to try, but it's not one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Himal Chuli is a home-like spot for refreshing and tasty Nepali and Tibetan food.  It's a small cosy family owned restaurant on the always bustling State street. It has a very warm and fuzzy decor, nothing too over the top eye-catching. People are here for one reason, food.  We came for a Sat light lunch before heading to the overture for a show. It was busier than I would expect. They have a relatively small group of staff, however, service was prompt and friendly.  We tried two soups, which one is supposed to be very spicy with various veggies, like carrots, cabbage and broccoli with momos. The other one is a thicker lentil base soup. The choice of either roti and rice was given which we picked over of each.  If I had to describe their food, it's got a very clean flavor, very refreshing, it's food that you think you can eat everyday. There have a wide selections of food, which I would like to come back and try.  One must try is their spiced coffee and chai. Best I have had in town!"}
{"text":"Best best best restaurant in town. Wholesome food, awesome people. Can't recommend enough."}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly and helpful with choices and questions. I should branch out and try other options but I am a huge fan of Roti, Takari and Dal. The Takari changes daily, the special one other, but you can get half and half.    The have a very good menu options, Vegetarian and non Vegetarian choices as well.  I have been here a few times and definitely enjoy the experience every time."}
{"text":"In light of becoming vegetarian, I have decided to re-post my review/re-profess my love for Himal Chuli in a vegetarian light:   Dear Himal Chuli,   You still rock my socks. Your Momocha and Tarkari make me melt inside, and your Dal takes me to another world of happiness and bliss. Your Masala Tea makes me feel a happiness so complete that I could not imagine life without it.   \"Dhanyabad\" and My Love forever,    Jake S."}
{"text":"Deliciously wonderful food - my absolute favorite place to go in Madison - especially when the weather is cold.  Combo platter is my favorite dish - a little bit of everything and it all has a wonderful taste - just make sure you savor it to get the full experience.  Best place ever!"}
{"text":"This place is so cute! Quaint and on state street, i missed it every time until my friend decided he wanted to try it. Nom nom nom-- here's what we got:   Himals combination platter: a little taste of everything from their dumpling,  flat bread, curry for the day, and samosas! I would recommend this as they say in their menu as an appetizer. It's a great sampling and super flavorful.  Chicken sikar: you get your choice of jasmine or brown rice or bread. You can't go wrong with any of it, and his chicken was moist and well seasoned. It was a mix of regular stewed chicken but not as mushy and even more flavorful. It came with a lentil soup and while I don't really like beans this soup was really quite good!   Overall the service was good, comprehensive with the menu and very nice. I would be back with some of vegetarian friends because it is a good place for everyone to try something new and get some good food!   Happy eating"}
{"text":"I love the dal here. Make sure you get a cup with your meal. Has a nice hearty and sesame (I think) taste to it. I wish this could be my appetizer for pretty much every meal.  I ordered the takhari chana (garbanzo beans, carrots, onions, and potatoes) with dal. It is a nice filling vegetarian meal. Though they do have some meat dishes, I mostly come here for their veggie dishes. I can't wait to have some of their spicier dishes in the winter time. This is one of the better spots on State Street and has been around for a long time as well."}
{"text":"Tried A jackfruit dish named khattar kabab. Mindblowing is what i can say.. being accustomed to indian food, i found it out to b very less spicy. If you want you can ask for spicy sauce , and you should b good to go.. one advice to the management, plz make d place a little more cleaner and you will rock !!!"}
{"text":"Himal Chuli was my first experience with Nepali food, and I loved it then.  I've since tried much more Nepali food, and realize that Himal Chuli isn't the best out there, and is a little bit blander than I tend to like.  Still, the food is very tasty, and it's an excellent place to be a vegetarian.  Plus, the prices are rock-bottom (or were, when I was there-- it's been a few years).   Good, cheap food?  That is the way to Melody's heart.  You betcha."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on Saturday, and the overall experience was okay. The Chicken Sikar was delicious, but expensive. My lunch cost $14.99, and the amount of chicken on the plate was quite laughable.  If the quality of the food wasn't at such a high level, I would not recommend eating there.   Service was a little off, as our waitress had to be reminded several times to bring a couple things.  Overall, I'd suggest you check it out if you want something new. But expect to pay a lot for small portions."}
{"text":"My expectations were probably a bit too high; anywhere was bound to be a bit of a letdown.   There is nowhere like this in Madison - it's the only Nepalese restaurant in town, and it does serve authentic Nepalese foods. I think I was hoping for more spice and a wider menu of traditional Newari foods. A full dalbat meal would also be amazing!"}
{"text":"Great food great people. Small place. Came in with about 5 people and with a bit of a switcharoo was able to seat everyone together. Loved the desserts. Just remember to bring cash."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and had varying experiences with the quality of food. Sometimes everything tastes great and the sabzi (vegetable dish) is quality. Their momos are also consistently good. However, I've had the thukpa three times and two of those times it has been unbearably spicy, to the point where it is inedible. My boyfriend also had a similar experience with over-spiced food when ordering a chicken dish; we're Indian and used to very spicy food, but the times that stand out to me the dishes were just unbearably so."}
{"text":"**BE SURE TO BRING CASH.** I want every review here to say that at the top because it is integral for your enjoyment of this restaurant. The food stands on its own, certainly, but I'd hate to see someone who had a good meal knock the place down a star because they realized too late that it was a cash-only joint.  Let me kick this off by saying that the food here is so incredibly healthy - each dish has a variety of different vegetables and deft use of spice. But don't worry about burning your tongue out of your skull; unless it specifically says so on the menu, don't be afraid of foods being too hot.  For anyone trying out the place for the first time and wanting a \"safe\" option, you can't go wrong with the rice, tarkari, and dal. You get a healthy portion of one of the two tarkaris (a.k.a. veggie stir fries) of the day, some perfectly-cooked brown rice, and a bowl of a lentil-and-bean soup flavored with cumin seeds and cilantro. Ask for half of each flavor of tarkari for the ultimate Himal Chuli sampler platter.   Other favorites include: -Katahar Kabob - don't be scared away by a jackfruit-based entree; it has the texture of artichoke hearts and such rich depth of flavor that I would eat a bucket of this if I could.  -Momos and momochas - their two varieties of dumpling are both flavorful and quite tasty, although the price is pretty steep at $1.50-2.00 per dumpling. A great way to try these dumplings is in my next recommendation... -Tuk-Pa - a spicy vegetarian soup with clear broth, fresh veggies, and your choice of dumpling - I recommend getting one of each. If you're freezing after a day shoveling out your car from the ridiculous Madisonian snowfalls, this is one dish that will warm you up from the inside out. -Dahi Bada and Himal Salad - a perfect combination for a summer meal on a sweltering day, this is a great pair of dishes. The salad is crisp and fresh with a citrusy dressing and the Dahi Bada reminds me of a lighter, non-fried falafel that comes swimming in a yogurt sauce flavored with sweet tamarind and a complex mix of spices. Dunking your roti from the salad into that yogurt sauce is just... agh. I can't even find the words for it. Just try this combo. Do it. -Gajar Halauwa - sweet carrot desserts that are heavenly and perfectly-portioned.  The non-vegetarian entrees, while good, have not given me the same \"wow\" feeling as the vegetarian options. I've tried at least one of each of the chicken, lamb, and bison offerings, and I keep going back to the non-meat items. Maybe it's that the meat weighs down an otherwise light and healthy-feeling meal, I don't know. I just think, for the price, you're better served trying out a meatless option for a meal.  In case it wasn't clear, I really love this place. I moved out of Madison a few years ago and realized that this is one of the restaurants I miss the most. You won't regret giving Himal Chuli a try."}
{"text":"Visiting from the west coast, was surprised to find an authentic place like this serving quality ethnic food in Wisconsin. Food and service were top notch."}
{"text":"This is a lovely restaurant with very delicately and subtly seasoned food.  Tibetan food to me seems a lighter and more understated, but yet more flavorful Indian food.  The setting here is unpretentious, and can I say, somewhat spiritual.  I love this restaurant and eat here every time I visit Madison."}
{"text":"I have a Nepalese food fixation going on! And apparently folks in Madison also do - I was delighted therefore to have to choose between 3 listed Nepalese/Tibetan restaurants all within a stone's throw from each other.  Given time allowed me to try just one, I went by the book i.e the hotel restaurant guide..which we validated with trusted sources i.e our hotel shuttle driver :)...who incidentally also provided the local scoop on the Dalai Lama influence which explained how a relatively rare cuisine appeared rather mainstream in Madison.  With all that careful planning leading up to the trip to Himal Chuli, I was nervous about being disappointed ( and disappointing my folks who were Nepalese neophytes). Thankfully Himal Chuli served up food that was every bit as good as I'd hoped it would be -- along with plenty of doses of learning about Nepalese cuisine!  We selected a cauliflower based tarkari which was great but our favorite was an okra-potato combination - loved it so much that I've even googled the recipe and tried a repeat version at home -- something I rarely do!  I was surprised that the food was a bit bland, but somehow it tasted delicious!  The sweet carrot dessert was a perfect ending to a near perfect lunch.  Himal Chuli is one of those small, unassuming, simple places that serves up real good food - it brought back some good memories of college town living and has spurred a serious Nepalese food quest!"}
{"text":"We were traveling across country and went to this place based on yelp reviews. The food was fantastic and tasted sooooo fresh. It was so nice to have a home cooked meal. I was also very excited to try Nepalese food. I grew up in an area with just about any kind of food imaginable but I had never had Nepalese food and I'm hooked!"}
{"text":"Great spicy vegetarian options - I had the... actually, I have no idea what I had. Spicy soup. Really great :D I have no frame of reference for Himalayan cuisine, other than that I've had momos on occasion, so this was a nice little adventure for me!  Great service, outstanding food, pleasant ambiance. I'd recommend Himal Chuli to anyone!"}
{"text":"The food is definitely good. Lots of options for vegetarian. The eggplant meal was great and the portions are good, although the prices seem a bit high.  They are cash and check only and I didn't see a sign outside and no one said anything when we walked in. There's a fee free ATM across the street but it would have been nice to know going in.  The service was only okay though. The waiter wasn't very attentive, got the order wrong, appeared to have some attitude when he collected our menus and brought us our check before we even said we were finished (one of my pet peeves in restaurants - hence 3 and not 4 stars) and therefore had to hand write in the desserts."}
{"text":"Excellent small dishes with nice level of spice. I've been here several times and have been pleased each time. We had a vegan and a meat connoisseur in our party. This pleased both."}
{"text":"Some Nepalese food reminds me more of Tibetan food - this restaurant definitely has that component, to my palate.   Had the combination dish with dal (which really is more like a flavorful soup), Roti, momo, and a samosa. The samosa was doused in this yogurt-y sauce that was quite refreshing and nicely paired. Momo dumplings had a sweet tomato sauce, couldn't discern what was inside but it was tasty. Lots of Roti on the plate, maybe a little too much with respect to other things on the plate. I guess i would prefer to have the dal served with the meal instead of before, but this is perhaps a custom for this spot!  Also had a cup of chiya which was great, add a little sweetener if it's not satisfying your sugar teeth.   Lovely place and good vibe with folks from the culture just simply hanging."}
{"text":"Our previous experience with Nepalis food is spicy food so we came here with that expectation. So just a little disappointed as it was not spicy as we imagined.   Food was okay but it took forever to get a seat and get food to plate! Appeared that they have some personnell issue in background.  Not sure if I will try again or not. Just okay type place!"}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant in a lovely part of town. They have a cozy interior and a small outdoor space. The restaurant is cash or check only, which I found unusual in this day and age. The food was quite good, and I will try more dishes if I'm back in the area. The portion wasn't terribly large, and the price wasn't particularly low, but it seemed fair.  It's nice that they have a large vegetarian selection."}
{"text":"This has been a favorite of mine for many years. Food and service are always superb. The menu has tons of spicy vegetarian dishes, but plenty of options for meat eaters as well."}
{"text":"I've gone to this quaint restaurant on numerous occasions. Nepal food is not my usual- but I can't stay away. I've never been let down by order the daily Takari. Never disappoints! So much flavor. It's a clean place with great lighting. It's a fun place to go on a date if you're meeting up with people later on State St."}
{"text":"One of my favorites. I love the Seitan Buff but everything is good here. I'm delighted that I can now get a glass of wine with my meal as well. Great service too."}
{"text":"The food at Himal Chuli is certainly 5 stars' worth of delicious, but I've had some seriously slowwww service and the prices for some of the dishes are a bit outrageous for how much food they give you.  Thus, the 4-star rating.  Everything I've ever eaten there has been spectacularly tasty.  The momochas and samosas are divine, and the daily specials (Tarkari) are always a treat -- spiced veggies that you can choose to pair with roti (bread), rice and/or dal.  Definitely spend the extra buck to get the dal -- it is extremely delicious and you'll wish they gave you more than that teeny little cup!  My very favorite dish is the Tofu Buff, which is seasoned tofu and veggies over rice (you can choose white or brown for any dish).  Be warned -- some of the dishes are pretty spicy, and they don't ask you to choose your spice comfort level.  But I always walk out of there feeling not just sated, but *healthy* -- like I've done something really good for my body.  I practically bounce away down State Street when I leave the place.  But that brings me to my first issue with Himal Chuli -- the portion sizes vs. the price.  Over the years, I have watched the price of my beloved Tofu Buff skyrocket to $15 -- and it's really not that much food.  I'm aware that restaurants often overserve, often to the point of ridiculousness (I'm looking at you, Cheesecake Factory).  But the dishes at Himal Chuli are really quite small -- easily finished in a sitting if you're hungry -- and as a poor grad student, I really can't swing $15 for something I can't make a meal of later.  (To be fair, the equally-small daily specials are $8 or $9, depending on whether you add the dal.)  My second issue is with the service.  It certainly isn't unpleasant at all, but it has been extremely slow in the past, even when the place was basically empty.  I also wish they took credit cards.  For a lesser restaurant, these issues would mean a 2- or 3-star review, but Himal Chuli has such great food and is such a cool place that I have to go with 4."}
{"text":"Cash only. Just make a note of that , since it's not very obvious. This is one of my go-to spots in Madison. Cheap and yummy -- they have two choices of tarkari that are described on cards on the tables. The cauli is my favorite: cauliflower, potatoes, peas, yummy. Go for broke and get dal and roti, all for under 10 bucks. It's a small place so not great for big groups, but conversely it's  a great place if you are dining alone since you won't feel all weird. Service is restrained but attentive."}
{"text":"It was good, but nothing to write home about.  Had the sampler, tea, and buff."}
{"text":"amazing decor  try the entire menu  don't forget yak meat"}
{"text":"Himal Chuli is an institution on State Street in Madison, and is a great place for vegetarians. From small families, students, to professors kvetching about tenures- this is a popular place for Madisonians of all stripes. It's not fancy or expensive, which is how I like State Street institutions. Service is friendly and perfect for the restaurant. Our favorite dishes:  Tofu or chicken Buff Cho Mari Tofu or chicken Polungo  \"Where do you want to go?\" \"Let's go to Himal Chuli!\" \"I was thinking the same thing!\""}
{"text":"Very solid food (no, not literally!). They have plenty of great vegetarian options. Most of the dishes come in a stew form. Service is also quite good. My one complaint is the serving sizes. They'e okay, but not nearly as large as other similar restaurants in the area. All in all, pretty good."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in the area, I always make it a point to stop here. Yesterday, I introduced my soulmate to Himal Chuli and he loved it! The food is always so nourishing and is spiced just right, plus it's delicious! I've never had a poor meal here. I always get the dal and roti, too. It's always makes me happy to eat here."}
{"text":"4 stars :  - Very tasty food.  The food has less oil and very flavourful. Definitely reminds of Himalayan homestyle meals.  - The dish can be customized w/ spice level. At extreme end it is definitely hot.   2 stars :  - The portions are very conservative. i.e.  Dish can't be shared w/ friends and family.  - Also,  CASH only,  so carry enough cash. The dishes are priced at higher end, means one needs to carry lot of cash... - It is very small cramped place so not good to go as big group...  - Even if you can get seating, you may not be comfortable w/ noise."}
{"text":"really tasty dishes - and affordable menu - outside seating offer beautiful views of the city/capital and street action"}
{"text":"Came here with boyfriend, who is Nepali , the food is not authentic at all! Momo, Nepali spice chiya, which are supposed to be unique Nepali food, do NOT have real Nepal flavor at all!!!  And their meat is absolutely not fresh! We ordered chili chicken and chicken sikar, and both of the chicken have that terrible smell! Tasted like not well-cooked ! The price is expensive, the portion is so little. And they do not tell you until you are ready for the bill that it is CASH only!  Totally a waste of money!"}
{"text":"My new favorite Nepali restaurant!  I've traveled to Nepal a number of times and Himal Chuli is wonderful in just about every category.  It's location on funky State Street guarantees a steady stream of adventurous, well-traveled customers, so they haven't felt the need to Americanize (or Indianize) the food.  The atmosphere is intimate and friendly, and the open air kitchen in the back is spotless and well-organized.  We were a bit worried about availability of a high chair in the small indoor seating area--but not only did they bring a high chair right away, they also brought a plate of piping hot flatbread and honey for dipping for the baby!  The usual waitress was off at the last minute, so we were served by a combination of the grandmother, grand-aunt, and several of the cooks.  Each of them greeted us with warmth and good humor, and plenty of silly smiles for our one-year-old daughter.  We started with Dal and Momos, which were fresh, flavorful, and quick to arrive.  The entres came out shortly thereafter and were equally outstanding.  Highlights included the chicken sikar, as well as the saag, chickpea, and potato takari.  We will definitely be back next time we're in Madison!"}
{"text":"My second time here. It's a great place for vegetarians and vegans who want to try something different for a date.   Compared to the usual American fare, the food is more bland but that's a good thing. I ordered the Hyala (soup) which has lots of veggies plus some bison. I thought I wouldn't be fulfilled since it was a light dish but after eating it, my whole body felt wonderful! Like I ate something that was very good and nourishing for my body. I didn't feel that lethargy that usually sets in after chowing down some greasy American fare. It was refreshing.  Anyway, it's 4 stars because the dishes still felt overpriced. I'd come here again though rarely.  Recommendations: Order the Nepali Chiya (tea) for sure.  If you're a meat lover, try the lamb sikar. Very flavorful."}
{"text":"Who knew the Nepalese ate so well? After going here, you'll agree.  Their menu has a good balance of vegetarian and meat dishes - which makes me happy. Not overly spicy also. All of the food I've had here has been very good. Good addition to the state street variety.  Favorite touch - the mint and lemon in the water. Yum- like a reverse slap in the face."}
{"text":"Pay attention on why i gave them five stars, and set your expectations accordingly. If you are looking for an upscale indian food experience then this place is NOT for you. But if you would like to get some good wholesome Indian ( North Indian / Himachali ) food then you must try this place. The Jackfruit dish called Khattar kabaab is simply awesome, guaranteed that no one in US can make this dish the way they made it and this was THE best jackfruit dish that i ever ate. Himachali Indian Or Nepalese food is not oily or spicy and you will find that true here. My advice to the management, please keep the place a bit more clean. Me and my wife ate here 12 years ago and came back to find that the food still tasted good. I will be back, soon"}
{"text":"I had never eaten Nepalese until checking out Himal Chuli, after eating there once I was hooked. You know you have a homerun when you think about their food WEEKS later. This was the case for me at Himal Chuli.   I have had the combination platter and Chef's choice. I love the option of those because you get to try a few different things. Everything was and always is delicious. One of these days I may even try something else. :)   It's different then other places on State St and certainly worth a try if you haven't been over there yet. The service can be a little slow, but that just leaves more time to anticipate what you are going to eat. Oh and heads up, they only take cash!"}
{"text":"Oh yes! Clean, honnest, yummy home-cooked food! Lots of vegetarian options. We really enjoyed it. Thank you so much."}
{"text":"It was surprising to me how little food I got for what I paid, and what I received wasn't amazing.  I had the combination platter, with momochas, a samosa, a cup of dal and roti.  I didn't really like the momochas, and they also seemed to fuse with the bottom of the take-out box, ripping apart when I tried to pry them up.  Surely they could package takeout better than this.  The samosa was okay, but I've had better.  The spices in the dal tasted odd--I wasn't really a fan.  I also had a salad, with dressing that I really didn't like at all.  For the price, I shouldn't have gone to bed hungry after that meal, but I did.  There are better vegetarian options in Madison."}
{"text":"I visited Madison for a week, and I can already say this is my favorite restaurant in the area. The menu is quite diverse, and there are many vegetarian/ vegan and even gluten free options. The food has a great balance of flavors. I ordered a delicious (vegan) okra dish. I also liked the dal that came with my entree. There are many options to try!  It's a small, cozy place with outside seating as an option. It definitely has a home-like vibe. The restaurant staff I met were all friendly. The individual who brought our food that night was very knowledgeable about the menu, gave us some great recommendations for entrees, and was also genuinely kind.  Some of the menu options are higher priced, but I believe it to be worth it overall. A great little place that in my short visit was very memorable.   I do hope we cross paths again some day."}
{"text":"Food was decent and the service was fairly good as well. I got the lamb dinner and it was quite delicious. But my girlfriend's soup based meal was really subpar for $11. The house special dessert was pretty good. Overall, decent food but a little overpriced."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant, and not just because \"Vegetarian\" is the main section of the menu with \"Non-Vegetarian\" at the back.  (What a refreshing change of pace!)  The food is amazing enough to make up for the moderately high prices.  EVERYTHING they serve is delicious; even their water is freshened with lemon and mint.    The restaurant is small and can feel a little cramped during busy times, which is why I often go during off-peak times (11:00-noon or in the late afternoon).  I like to sit at their outdoor tables in summer and read a book while enjoying State St. and a wonderful meal.  If you're going for the first time, get their combination platter with a lassi or cup of chiya (chai).  On your second visit, try the takari or one of the \"buff\" dishes.  They do not take credit card, which has resulted in a couple embarrassing dashes to the ATM for me, but the waitstaff are quite friendly and understanding.  They also give 10% off for Bicycle Benefits stickers, so if you love the food but are on a budget, bike there!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurant's in Madison, nay, the world.  It feels so healthy.  Many vegetarian/vegan options.  You can specify whole wheat roti and brown rice.  My go to order is the combination plate.  comes with:  -A cup of DAL: rich and flavorful.  I always think it needs more salt. -a SAMOSA: filled with spices and potatoes.  A bit dry but covered in yogurt sauce so you can dip.  Not greasy because they're baked not fried! -two mamochitas--dumplings filled with peanut paste and covered in a fresh tomato sauce.  Really tender and chewy -whole wheat rote: it seems crazy but this is the best part.  It's hot and salty and tastes like a healthy Aunt Annie's pretzel.  Wheat is better tasting than white!  This visit we also got 6 momo's --beef/lamb filled dumplings in a fresh tomato sauce DELICIOUS  and Lamb Sikar: tender chunks of lamb, steamed spinach, brown rice, a cup of dal.  I'd definitely get it again.   It's family owned and definitely got hole-in-the-wall chic but that means that it's cash only = a pain if you don't come prepared.  It's also not super cheap.  It's such quality food so it's worth it."}
{"text":"I was somewhat disappointed by this place, coming in with almost no expectation (Mother always said to try new things right?). I have simply decided Nepali food is just not for me. There were very few meat options and the portions were not great. I almost felt I could have cooked a better meat and rice dish for a much cheaper price in my own home.  -2 as the entrees were good, but overpriced (and cash only!)."}
{"text":"Small, laid back, delicious hole in the wall-esque place on State Street. Nepalese has a lot of the flavors I love about Indian, but isn't as heavy so I will always be up for it.   They have an extensive vegetarian menu which I'm frequently too stuck in my carnivorous ways to delve into, unfortunately.  Some great options: 1) Get the momochas to share as an appetizer. They're tasty, light dumplings in a tasty tomato sauce. I haven't actually tried the meat-itarian momos just yet. 2) For entree...well, they're all quite tasty, but I'm partial to the beef buff. 3) If the dish doesn't come with roti (flat bread), make sure to order some."}
{"text":"Small cozy place on State Street. Tried several different dishes and all were very good."}
{"text":"Excellent place to take vegetarians! There is meat on the menu, but I wouldn't order any of the meat dishes, the vegetarian dishes are well priced and delicious!  Fantastic dal and roti, the combination platter is great.    A++ decor and service, nice patio option in the summer."}
{"text":"Expensive, slow, and the food wasn't even that great.  I'm the type of person that likes everything, but if I'm going to dish out a bunch of money, I want something to rave about, not rant about.  I'm not sure what was up with the waitress either, she was pretty cold.  She walked past my empty water glass twice, staring at my table.  So, when she walked by with the pitcher, I thought I was going to get a refill.  Nope.  She went to another table and didn't bother to stop at mine.  Just kept walking past."}
{"text":"Since I have nothing to compare it to, it's a solid 4-4.5. Hard to give a 5. Smallish place, cozy but comfy. Server very fast and attentive. We got the roti and takari with a split (tried both takari's of he day). They had a cauliflower one and one with tofu. Both great. Wife got the himal platter to taste a few things. And I got the momo to have a little meat. Liked the momo better than the momocha, the peanut in that was slightly bland. Still good. And the spicy tomatoey sauce on both was very tasty, made the dish. The rotis were thick, but not chewy, just right. Had the wheat and the white, both excellent. The samosa was good, oh, and the dal that came with the platter was very flavorful too.   Felt very wholesome, tasty, get portions not overwhelming.   Oh, best part was the homemade hot sauce! I asked for something on the side, got a little tin with a very spicy homemade, sort of like sambal, but way better. If you like hot, that got me sweating but good."}
{"text":"Yum....I dream of this restaurant when not in Madison.  I eat there every time I return.  From the moment I walk throught he door, I smell curries and feel transported.  In the summer, I enjoy sitting on the streest-side terrace sipping minted water and in the winter, I enjoy warming up with a hot chai tea.  I like everything on the menu and have never been disappointed.  The momos, momochas and takaris are favorites.  I love the dahl and the naan.  There are two takaris to choose from each day.  Last time I shared sample platters with a friend so that we could have a bit of everything.    I will dream of momo until next time..."}
{"text":"Like fellow reviewers, I've never eaten Nepali food outside of here and its sister restaurant Chautara, I've had several amazing meals here. Simple fresh food in the traditionally laid-back State Street atmosphere. Everything I have had was good here. Great for vegetarians and those seeking a unique ethnic-fod experience."}
{"text":"I just arrived in Madison and was pooped from a long day + travel. I was really hungry and excited for a low key, hot meal. I had a bunch of work to catch up on so searched for a vegetarian friendly place that would also deliver. I was excited to find veggie Nepalese food that was close to the hotel. Every dish, even things that seemed like sides seemed pretty expensive so I assumed the portions would be enormous. I don't want enormous portions but I also didn't want teeny portions with a high price tag. I ordered a soup and it was basically a cup of soup for over $10. I didn't order anything else sadly and am left feeling pretty hungry. Wahh. Haha.   Should have read more of the reviews!!!"}
{"text":"My first time trying Napali food, it was pretty amazing! If you like curry you will Definitely like the sikar dish. I tired Del and Lamb sikar with rice. The lamb was so tender and the spices Judy hit the right spot. I think it would be amazing to have this dish in winter :)"}
{"text":"Sorry, I can't agree with the great ratings this place is getting. I will agree, the food was tasty, I ordered chicken, it was $16.99. It was less than a quarter chicken, with some spinach, black eyed peas and spices. Then I got a soup, it was basic veggie soup with spices.$8.99. Over priced and cash only. Blah!"}
{"text":"It's so incredibly good, healthy and warming, it's hard to imagine how their food (or almost any) could be better. I think every visit here I've gotten the daal tarkari and roti combo, anticipating the surprises of the tarkari of the day. Just had the bhanta today and like all the others, the spices and flavors feel like they're 9 layers deep. That said, this is very simple, clean, and above all nourishing food."}
{"text":"When visiting Madison Wisconsin and love vegetarian food.  This is the place to visit.  Food is really yummy.  Only cash or check."}
{"text":"LOVED the samosas and tarkari. The naan and dal were awesome too. Great service too. My only beef with the restaurant is that it is cash only. We had already been seated and ordered when we realized! Had to walk a mile to get cash while my wife waited at the restaurant. But really, the food was very worth it."}
{"text":"The steamed peanut dumplings are excellent. I should have ordered them and nothing else,  I don't care for the spice mixture that Himal Chuli uses on many of their dishes.  I ordered a vegetable stew called Khichadi that includes tomatoes, peas and other flavorful vegetables, but the overwhelming taste of cumin, turmeric and cilantro displeased me.  I've had really tasty Himalayan food in a different city where they used very different spices and had very different menu offerings.  I guess there are different cuisines in the Himalayas and not all of them are to my liking.  The decor in this restaurant is hideous, and the service was weird too, so I know some people must love their food, or this restaurant wouldn't exist.  The lady that I assume is the owner seems really sweet and I could see her attracting a following."}
{"text":"This has always been one of my favorite Madison restaurants. Himalayan cuisine shares some elements with Indian, but is definitely it's own style with more subtle seasoning. Vegetarian choices abound, but there are plenty of dishes with meat for the omnivores. I particularly like the lamb. Dal is a must-have with any meal!"}
{"text":"I had a pretty pleasant meal here. Really can't beat that State Street location in the summer for outdoor dining. The food was pretty good. It didn't blow me away, but it was definitely above average. The quantity of food was disappointing though. For the money, I feel that the servings should be a little bit larger. However, I was impressed with the service, which was fairly quick and overall this was a good eating experience."}
{"text":"So, I've never had Nepalese (Nepali?) food before, so I don't know if anything I had tasted like what it's \"supposed\" to taste like, but I do know that it tasted really, really good.  The starter soup was yummy, my vegetable dish (I think it was just called tarkari with rice) was yummy, my friend's cho mari (kind of like an empanada or a flattened calzone stuffed with vegetables) was yummy.  Everything was good.  It was very similar to Indian food, but less intense as far as spice and heaviness go.  They probably mild it up for the Wisconsin palate, but it's still good.  And of course, I love it that there were plenty of vegetarian options.  One really nice little touch: the water pitchers all had fresh mint and lemon in them, the water had a slight, refreshing flavor.  It was lovely.  Go, you'll like it.  But remember to bring cash, because they definitely don't take plastic!  Luckily there's a free ATM across the street and another one next door."}
{"text":"I make it a point to swerve into Madison when driving to Chicago or points east for lunch or dinner at Himal Chuli.  This is very homey very decent, very delightful food. There is good Nepali food in the Twin Cities too, but I'm spoiled by the feeling you get being fed by a family with food that really does feel steeped in love and warmth, there's such a fresh simplicity here - it fortifies you for travel and driving like nothing else.  My favorite when in Madison."}
{"text":"Himal Chuli has good food.  However, they also gave me food poisoning.  Years later,  I was dragged back in there.  While the follow-up trip did not give me food poisoning, it did give my friend (the one who made me go there) food poisoning.  I could only say \"told ya so.\"    So...yeah.  Even though the food was technically tasty, I think I'll stick to other places that didn't make me feel like I was dying afterwards."}
{"text":"This past Friday was the PERFECT autumn day ...  sunny, mid-70's and light breeze swirling around bright colored leaves.  So, we decided to play hooky for the day and hit the road to Madison for lunch and then on to Mirror Lake State Park.    I had never been to Madison before, but my fiance who is from the area was chattering non-stop on the way about some Nepalese restaurant she had visited like 13 years ago that had \"delicious little dumplings\".  We arrived and enjoyed the sights and sounds of State Street while she tried to find this magical spot again.  Finally, she found it.  She thinks it's the same restaurant as it was years ago, but if not, they still served Nepalese food there so all was well.    Just wanting a little nosh, we parked ourselves in the outdoor seating area (the small dining room inside was packed anyway) and opted for a small order (4) of momo, the famed steamed dumplings she had talked about all morning.  These were filled with chicken, onions, celery and herbs, covered in a tomato coriander sauce.    They arrived quickly and were gone just as quickly.  They were light and fluffy and that tomato coriander sauce ... that was the star.  It was light with a distinctive kick that hits your mouth just right.  Would have loved a giant cup of that to dunk those little guys into (but that's probably frowned upon not just in Nepali culture, but universally).    I had a Coke and she had an iced tea which she claims was amazing and different from normal black iced tea.  I'll take her word for it.    The service was okay.  Not super friendly, but fine ... and relatively fast.  It served its purpose.    Overall, was a great little stop to refuel.  If I had any complaint, it was the price. While there are no regrets, $7.99 for four dumplings seems a bit steep.  If they came with a side of some sort; some rice, a small salad, perhaps ..."}
{"text":"Madison's best kept secret. Every day they have a new takari which is a blend of veggies and a Nepalese spice blend. It is offered with white or brown rice, and dal which is a very unique and flavorful lentil style soup. It's very small so go early for dinner to get seating. During the summer there is outdoor seating on state which is a fun perk. Fair warning, it is cash only!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, portions are a little small. But the food is also pretty inexpensive so you won't end up spending a fortune to get an entree plus a side of dal or momo. I tried the tuk-pa (a spicy veggie stew) with momo (the meat version) and a side of dal. Everything was really good and hearty. Great choice for a chilly night. Only draw-back (and why I didn't give 5 stars) is that they do not take credit cards. Luckily I had cash, it was worth it!"}
{"text":"I went here a few weeks ago and I've been thinking about it ever since. I'm moving out of state soon, but before I leave I plan to make a special trip out to Madison just to eat at Himal Chuli. Everything was FRESH FRESH FRESH and absolutely delicious. The food had unique flavors with just the right amount of spice and they had lots of vegetarian options.  *DROOL*     ...Really, I can't wait to go back..."}
{"text":"While the food is definitely tasty and homely, I am pretty disappointed with the pricing. I ordered a tofu dish which costed me a whopping $17 and hardly filled my stomach. I was really expecting more for the price I paid. You could try asking the waiter and make a better choice with your order to ensure that you don't over pay for your food. I would really suggest them to reconsider how they have priced some of their dishes."}
{"text":"The Dal (bean soup is delicious and hearty.  Flat bread and Somosa round out a really great meal.  The staff is super friendly and they've got inside and outside dining options.  You'll enjoy this place I promise."}
{"text":"I had the Palungo Chicken. It was a good meal, but nothing special! It is described as \"a generous slice of white meat,\" but the pieces were small and the meat wasn't very high quality. The dish was way overpriced for its size-  I do like smaller servings at restaurants (it did fill me up perfectly!) but I don't feel like I got great quality or size for paying $15.99. The soup they served before the meal was good, but again, not great!"}
{"text":"Chicken Sikar! Can't go wrong.   Let me start off by saying that I am a meat & potatoes kinda-girl, and, although I have been wanting to try this place for quite a while, I was intimidated by the menu and a little concerned for the primarily veggie-based cuisine.   But.... Boy, was the food delicious & filling! I would happily go back every time I'm in town. And, the staff was very kind. I took my food To-Go & they offered me lemon-mint water while I waited on their outside patio.  It was a great experience.   Couple of tips to get you started-   Most popular dish- Chicken Sikar. (Highly recommend!)  It comes with:  Dal = soup. I'm not sure if it changes daily or is always the same. Delicious, though!   Bhat = rice. Excellent method of consuming all the tasty juices left behind by the chicken & spices.  Tarkari = vegetable of the day!! No boring steamed stuff here! I had spinach (delicious with black eyed peas and potato with a hint of heat- although it's a mystery where it came and I am a big baby when it comes to heat) and a taste of the butternut squash (also fabulous). I'm not sure how they make veggies taste so good, but they do. :)  As a reminder, cash or check only, but the food is so good, it's worth any inconvenience.   I have a personal fondness for the country of Nepal and the plight their people are in, so, I was happy to kinda feel connected and support a business that is helping cultivate American's knowledge of Nepalese culture.   Excellent place!"}
{"text":"This place has a great selection of vegetarian dishes, so I decided to forego the meat and get the Seitan buff. I thought the food itself was great. Seitan is more commonly known as mock duck and has a chewy texture reminiscent of meat but  not quite the same. It went really well with the spices and vegetables it came with, and the side of roti was a perfect compliment to the meal.   The portion of their food is also good in terms of health but at the same time a bit expensive for what you get. Also they screwed up my order twice, which was a bit annoying.   Also, warning! This place is CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"Excellent place for lunch. Very quick service while we were there - Sunday lunchtime during the summer. Outdoor seating. Tasty options and excellent for vegetarians or vegans."}
{"text":"Yum! For not very much cash you get a delicious and eclectic dining experience. Fun sidewalk seating. The eggplant was delicious. The Samosa just OK. For the price the food was really enjoyable.  Bring cash.  Expect not speedy service. They only serve beer."}
{"text":"INCREDIBLE!!! Wow- after spending time IN NEPAL - cities, to villages, mountain tops to valleys, I did NOT expect amazing, authentic food- but I got that and BETTER. This place is the BEST Nepalese I've had anywhere in the world- who would have thought- in Madison, WI. That the Nepalese food is BETTER than the finest restaurants and base camp cooks in the kingdom can provide? Well- it's that good- seriously! Go now, eat, and smile! NAMASTE!"}
{"text":"The food was SMALL portioned and EXPENSIVE and tasteless! 1 beer and my child portioned meal was nearly  $22.00.  Waited a long time for our meal and even longer for a beer. I wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"I looove Himal Chuli. I admit that I don't branch out much--I prefer the Combination Plate.  Bean soup, flatbread, dumplings, and samosas. YUM!  The momocha (dumplings) are definitely my favorite.  The sweet and savory yogurt toppings they add to the plate really make it a great dish too. I wish I had the dal recipe!  No credit cards though"}
{"text":"I would give this a solid four stars, but my wife won't speak to me unless I give it 5.  The samosas are great, and the momo's are my wife's favorite.  Its pretty much a State street institution at this point and well worth a visit if you have never been there."}
{"text":"Take-Away: Hands down my favorite restaurant in Madison! This cozy Nepalese restaurant boasts the honor of serving the Dalai Lama when he comes to town! Wonderful and healthful food that's just as delicious as it is nourishing.   Food: I almost always get the combination platter as it's a great sampling of their dishes. I've had most of their menu items and nothing really disappoints. Their dal is fantastic and makes a cheap lunch or snack. Don't forget to order a sunny mango lassi as theirs is one of the best in town.   Ambiance/Service: Be warned that this restaurant has a very small dining space and is first come first serve. The service is friendly, if not a bit sluggish, it is a family restaurant after all. The walls are adorned with scenes of Nepal and the surrounding countries - the Dalai Lama hang by the register and the Nepalese flag is above the bathroom. There is a sense of coziness and comfort that permeates the restaurant. Be warned that they are CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"Maybe it's because I'm spoiled, but I think this place has an identity crisis.  Nepalese food is interesting, yes, but it's still more of a grab-and-go counter-service kind of meal.  If you're trying to make this more of a sit-down dinner, please have my server get my order right and not take 30 minutes to bring me a check.  Oh, and $40 for two people for lunch??  If you're doing that kind of pricing, then DON'T MAKE IT CASH-ONLY.  And please put a sign up on the door so people know to run to the ATM before they come in.  (I saw two parties leave and come back because they didn't have enough cash.)   All that being said, it gets 3 stars because the food was actually pretty good.  I got the Palungo Chicken, which had a lovely tomato sauce and plenty of rice.  I substituted the dal/salad for roti.  My only gripe is that there wasn't enough food... I was pretty much mopping up the sauce with the roti; I was still a little hungry afterwards."}
{"text":"good healthy, and tasty food. i had the lamb sikar and momos--both were delicious. momos are highly recommended. we also had the khichadi, which was good too. samosa was okay though.really liked that this place offers authentic nepalese food and does not mimic other south asian (especially indian) restaurants. the ambience is simple but authentic--with indoor plants and buddha statues. also, they only accept cash."}
{"text":"second trip was FAR better than the first... it's all about the dal, tarkari and rice entree. next trip, momos..."}
{"text":"This might be my all time favorite restaurant in Madison. They have so many great vegetarian options, but I almost always go with the daily special tarkari with roti and dal. The dal is always delicious, and the roti is incredibly soft and fresh, but what always amazes me is the tarkari. I've had a different kind almost every time that I've been here, and they are consistently outstanding.  I have brought both my boyfriend and my dad here, both of whom are total \"meat and potatoes\" guys, and they both loved it and my dad has been happy to return every time he comes to visit me in Madison.  The only negative thing I have to say about Himal Chuli is that the portion sizes are a little small. It's enough to leave me comfortably full at the end of the meal, but with the prices as high as they are, I always wish I had some leftovers to take home with me."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for over 10 years and they always have incredible food. Try their lentil soup and Takari and you'll be walking on clouds"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this place. Total college hole in the wall, relatively authentic Nepalese food with great service. I had the wheat gluten dish, which was ok but too salty for my taste and overpriced. I think their tarkari is worth it and I wish I had gotten that instead."}
{"text":"The lamb dish was the most tender lamb ever. It was delicious too. The mango lassi was not overly sweet like at a lot if places. I wish we had Himal Chuli where I live."}
{"text":"THE DAL THOUGH.   SERIOUSLY.  DAL.  Their take on the mixed bean soup is filling and just the right amount of spice and warms your belly. Perfect heat in winter, satisfying year-round.  PSSST it's a great cheap State St. eat. A bowl is only $4!"}
{"text":"PROS: Light, non-greasy dishes, fresh ingredients, homestyle cooking CONS: Pricey-for-portion, borderline bland  My feeling about the food at Himal Chuli (and perhaps Nepalese food in general) is that the dishes are essentially Indian, but without the heavy load of spices and ghee/butter. My taste buds were not wow'ed, but the dishes did feel more homey. A possible alternative for those who are turned off by strongly-spiced Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"When a coworker heard I was going to Madison, he told me that I HAD to go to Himal Chuli. I made him write it down because I had no idea what he was saying. He said he ate there at least 5 times a week; he must not have known how to cook. Went there for lunch around 2:30 with my boyfriend after a failed attempt to go see a screening of My Neighbor Totoro put on by the Cinematheque, and there were tons of open tables. The space is so tiny; I can't imagine it during a lunch rush.  Our Warby-Parker bespectacled waiter materialized almost instantly with waters after telling us we could sit anywhere. The water tasted kind of fruity, and I didn't figure out until later, when they were refilled, that it had been infused with lemon and cilantro. We looked over the menu and decided to share an order of chicken momocha, and the roti/tarkari combo. The momochas were reminiscent of the dumplings my mom makes, but with hot salsa to dip it in. Our entree came with a bowl of dal, which is a mixed bean soup that is so simple, but just the best. The humble bean was transformed into a transcendental soup. The saag tarkari was comparable to the Indian saag, but without the dairy component.   Overall, the meal was simple yet hearty. I was reminded of how humbly the other half lives, and how hunger is the best sauce."}
{"text":"I've been coming here regularly for almost 20 years.  The manager knows me, who I'm seeing, has opinions (:D) what I'm studying, etc.  It's always felt like home.  When there's new waitstaff, they are quickly told by old staff what to bring, because I always order the same thing.  This place makes my heart happy."}
{"text":"Good.  Food a bit less spicy than Indian.  Definitely homemade with a lot of care.  I had their popular chicken dish, which was tasty, and the rice pudding desert, which was awesome.  Portions were well sized.  I felt healthier after eating here.    Service was good, but not great.  Our server appeared to be very busy, but the place was less than half full.  Food came out within a reasonable time, and was piping hot.  The kitchen is in the back of the restaurant, so the food only had to travel about ten feet to the table.    The only complaint I have is the price - I'm sorry, but this place is simply overpriced.  There were only four staff members there, all of them appeared to be family.  Food costs can't be that much.  I have issues with paying 15 bucks for a chicken leg, half a chicken breast, some rice, and a scoop of basic veggies.  It was all good, but 8 bucks would have been MUCH more appropriate.  As it was, my reasonably sized meal - the aforementioned chicken, rice and veggies; a side of bread; and the rice pudding totaled 21 dollars.    In short - I would eat here again, but only if they dropped the prices to something reasonable."}
{"text":"Himal Chuli might be my all-time favorite restaurant in Madison. I've been going since I was a kid, and the quality and deliciousness is always on point. I also really appreciate that I can eat always count on Himal Chuli for food that is both delicious and healthful. My personal favorites include: Dal, hearty, creamy without cream soup Whole Wheat Roti Cinnamon Lassi Momocha, amazing dumplings with an incredible, tangy, fresh, slightly spicy tomato sauce Tofu or Chicken Polungo Almost any Takari, especially those with potatoes  I know some people find it to be expensive, but I find that I can eat either a cheap, smaller meal like Roti and Dal or a more expensive meal that leaves me with leftovers. Usually if I spend a lot, it's because I couldn't decide what to order and got a bit of everything.  The space is small and can be crowded, and the patio is a nice option in good weather."}
{"text":"The portions were small and the prices were high.  I really didn't see a distiction between this type of food and any number of small indian places."}
{"text":"Madison is an amazing town for a foodie- just walking down State Street I found a huge variety of cuisines.  I had heard about this place from a friend, and Yelped it to see if there were any particular dishes to try since I've never had Nepali food.  In the end I just asked the waitress to describe the most traditional foods and took her advice.    The service was excellent.  It's a very small place, and it wasn't too busy when I got there, just before noon, but it filled up quickly.  It has a nice atmosphere.  I had the chicken sikar: stewed meat and vegetables, very good.  Tarkari as a side- a sort of vegetable stew, also good.  Roti flatbread, and daal (lentil soup?) also came with the meal.  I had chai to drink, which was very flavorful; have had it before, but this was better.  They were almost out of dessert but gave me half an order of lal mohan, a sweetened rice ball.   A bit out of my way, but I'll try to go back."}
{"text":"I love me some ethnic vegetarian fare, but considering portion size and price, this place didn't rock my world. The spices and flavor of the stewed vegetables were really delicious and the wheat roti was dense and hot. I got one samosa which wasn't that good - liked the filling - did not like the dough, but the sauce it came with was pungent and yummy. Despite the nice authentic flavors here, to get one samosa, and one small veggie dish for $12  just doesn't cut it for me. I will continue to search for the best cheap eats I can find."}
{"text":"My first time at a a Nepalese restaurant. Who knew you it would be in Wisconsin! A nice little restaurant on the main street, with friendly servers and great food!  The portions are on the small to medium size, so my only real complaint would be that they should give a little bit more food to even out with the not so cheap prices, or give the small (normal- keep it as is) size portions and lower the prices. Prices are more for a tableclothy mood light restaurant, This place is more of a sit down/take out style (although it is a restaurant not a dive) Other than that, the food was great!.    There are many vegan/veggy dishes to choose from as well as meat dishes.  My friends were very happy with what they chose, considering none of us have eaten this before. The way I would describe the cuisine would be a mix of Indian and Japanese/Chinese. The boys had the curry dishes, which reminded me of Chinese food curry or Caribbean curry. The girls had the vegan dishes, mine was amazing. I don't know what they put on my asparagus but it was seasoned to perfection. The dumpling appetizer (I forget the name of it) was pretty good as well. I was surprised when it came with a tomato sauce!   If your in Madison, check this place out."}
{"text":"I love love love this place....one of my favorite places in town....pretty much a hole in the wall next to it's trendier cousin, Chautara.....but the food is just as good, if not better...and definitely cheaper!....and if you are sitting outside on a pleasant saturday afternoon, who cares how dingy they are inside.  My only complaint is that although it's very reasonable for dinner, they have the same prices for lunch, so it makes it slightly on the expensive side, given that you can find cheaper lunch options that are just as good...i mean you are on State street!  Nonetheless, lunch or dinner, I'd definitely go here over and over again!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place to eat in all of Madison.  I wish they sold that Dal in large quantities.  Go next door to Chautara if you want something fancier, more expensive, and serving alcohol. I believe they are owned by the same family.  Himal Chuli is better, though.  My favorite dish is the cauli \"tarkari\", a veggie stewish kinda thing that changes everyday....I think they offer like 2 different versions of it at a time..."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm too critical, but for two entrees, including tip (and waters) for $35, I feel like I should leave feeling full.  It's not like it's a  fancy joint...  We took my son and there was no kid's menu. And while the flavors were delicious, I didn't expect to leave feeling like we should definitely get dessert somewhere, and a big one at that.  I'm vegetarian and there were lots of options. I guess I picked the wrong server recommendation with a broth base...  Delicious, yes.  Overpriced for the amount of food? Totally.  I'd have rated much higher if my portion size was 30% or more... just sayin'."}
{"text":"If there was a negative review I would give it.. This place is a shame and any reviews that are positive are definitely fake... Utterly waste of my $16 for a dish I wouldn't pay $2 ... Don't even walk into this place by mistake!!!"}
{"text":"Himal Chuli is one of the flagship veg-friendly restaurants in Madison. It's a super-small and friendly place, which can get filled up pretty quickly during peak hours, so keep that in mind. Also keep in mind that this place isn't great for groups larger than two or three, given the limited space.  I noticed that they've increased their prices, and the more sophisticated dishes (such as the ones with seitan) are $15, while their 'tarkari' (vegetarian) combo selections are around $7-9, and served with a small herbal-bean soup, a main dish, and either rice or roti (note: the roti doesn't appear to be vegan).  These are steep prices, considering the place is CASH or CHECK-ONLY, so make sure to carry at least $40 or more, if you plan to splurge on dishes.  The food is wonderful. It's fresh, light and simple and feels home-cooked. It's rare that you find South Asian food like this (and I would know, as I'm South Asian myself and eat out almost every day). They have rotating 'tarkari' selections; the last time I went I had a combo meal with a butternut squash curry and also a spinach-blackeyed peas-potato dish.  I wish Himal Chuli were 100% vegetarian, because Madison desperately needs an all-vegetarian restaurant, especially on State St., but, as it stands, Himal Chuli is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Good, but expensive food.   Poor service, not particularly nice server. Portions are moderate, Nepali cuisine is much like Thai without the extreme spices or the sweetness. Very very good vegetarian selection."}
{"text":"This is a gem that is hidden in plain sight on State Street! With the modge podge of colorful and diverse food offerings, Himal Chuli gets lost in the mix, but stands on its own for quality! I have enjoyed the food here on two occasions and eagerly look forward to future trips to Madison just to eat here again.  I ate here the first time in the summer and enjoyed their patio seating, the second time in late fall and ate indoors. The place is tiny, and especially when outdoor seating is not an option, does not have much space. The menu is extensive, and while being well laid out, the staff is happy to help with suggestions and advice. On my first visit, I enjoyed the chicken sikar with jasmine rice and samosas. The dish was flavorful, but not spicy. On my second visit, I had a bit of a cold and tried the hyala (soup) with momo (chicken dumplings) and added extra spice. This is important to note - the dishes are fragrant and filled with spices, but for the most part are not spicy. Additional spices can be added upon request.  The roti (whole wheat) flat bread is another savory treat when eating here. I also enjoyed their seasonal lemonade with lemon and basil. Even their ice water is garnished with fresh mint.  One thing to keep in mind - Himal Chuli is cash only! There is an ATM at the gyro shop next door that does not charge a fee, should you need cash in a pinch."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was lacking.   Tonight my girlfriend and I decided we wanted to have Nepalese food for dinner. After checking all the yelp reviews we decided on Himal Chuli. We showed up at 7:10PM thinking that we would have enough time to finish dinner. The first thing that the server told us was that there was no room inside and we would have to eat outside if we wanted to eat. We said that was fine, so we got placed outside. Our first interaction with the server was really abrupt. It definitely gave us a negative vibe. We briefly thought about leaving but decided to stick it out. We were asked if we were ready, found out that they were out of the Nepalese tea, that was disappointing. I think we probably should have just left and tried somewhere different but it seemed too late. We saw the same server joking around and being nicer to other customers, so I assume that good service does happen here... just not for us apparently.   We ordered the Chicken Buff and the Chicken Sikar. The food came out really quickly and we realized that this place closed at 8 and that was probably why they were trying to pump us though. It would have been nice if they had just told us that the restaurant would be closing soon, that way we probably could have come back another day and given a better review.   The food was really good. I think that is the major saving grace of our dinner. The chicken was spiced very nicely and it was flavourful. It comes with sauce and vegetables. I noticed that you need to order the roti separate, which is kind of another thing disappointing.  We got to the front to pay and realized that they only take cash. It's 2016 and your restaurant is on the busiest street in Madison. Get a debit machine, come with us into the future.   Sad to say I probably wont be back. If I were to ever eat here again it would be takeout only. I think I will try to look around for better Nepalese options."}
{"text":"The other Nepalese restaurants in town fuse too much Indian cuisine in their menus to reach a broader base, but Himal Chuli is as authentic as it gets.   If you want to see what real Nepalese food is like, this is where you want to go.   I recommend the Roti (flat bread), Tarkari (vegetables) and Dal (lentil soup)"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent.  Way better than I expected, and I have travelled to Nepal.  It is really fresh and the spices are great!  I am a vegetarian and this was the best meal I had in Madison while here on business.  I tried other trendy Gastropubs that came highly recommended, but this place beat them hands down.  Only bad thing is that it's cash only."}
{"text":"This is one of the restaurants that I wish would incarnate itself in every city I live in.  Where to start... the spicy potato and slightly peanutty momochas are wondrous and tasty little dumplings.  The dal (lentil soup) and roti (flat bread) are completely amazing. I have tried several of the dishes and have never been disappointed.  If you are intimidated by the menu, check out the Himal sampler platter. Seating is limited and the restaurant is usually crowded during the dinner time, I usually prefer to come during the odder times of the day.  There are plenty of vegetarian dishes but there is also an ample selection of meat dishes. (beef, lamb, chicken, etc) However, don't let the crowded-ness keep you away from the amazing and unique food."}
{"text":"holy mother of god.  the tofu polungo is so deliciously well done. the tofu has unbelievable texture and is well-seasoned . the vegetables are properly cooked and the sauce is tasty."}
{"text":"The atmosphere there was very nice, the food was very flavorful, but pretty overpriced for the portion. The roti is disappointing. I was expecting something soft, fluffy and with multiple layers, instead we were given flatbreads that is the same as those Greek ones found at grocery stores. Again, decent food but not worth the price, but it's nice to try it once anyway."}
{"text":"I adore this place! They have Nepali and Tibetan food, and I'm partial to Tibetan food for the comfort and low-key-ness it provided during a very busy trip through northern India. The momos are a bit different than I expected, but I'm going to chalk that up to a difference between Tibetan and Nepali food. I love the Tuck-Pa, a Tibetan veggie soup with momocha right in the soup - it's just the right balance of spice and comfort food. I also highly recommend the Katahar Kebab, a traditional Nepali meat substitute made out of jackfruit. I've been here with friends that think $8-$14 is too much to pay, given the portions, but the quality is truly wonderful and authentic (in my limited experience and opinion), and I've never left hungry after ordering only an entree."}
{"text":"Really pricey for really unimpressive food. I ordered delivery, I don't know if the dining experience is different at the restaurant... but the quality of the food I received was poor. Samosas are $9 for two pieces! Most places they are around $2-$4. They were soggy and not flavorful. My entree was not as it was described on the GrubHub description. I'm really disappointed."}
{"text":"Adore! The prices are enough to make me head over heals for the place.  Add to this unique flavors not found anywhere else on State, I'm a fan.  Typical these days is the dal/roti/takari... the sweet potato being my fave.  And while service can be slow and it's cash only, knowing that going in makes it a wee more tolerable."}
{"text":"My husband found this divine little hole in the wall when he looked at the downtown promo map and it popped out with some writing in red. It is small and rather intimate with a happy feel. It's not trendy and so much better that way. It feels ageless. There is similarity with some Indian food but the seasonings are milder, pleasant, and totally unfamiliar to me. There is a huge vegetarian menu and we had no trouble avoiding gluten. For drinks, I had a Nepali chiya and was very happy, it was similar to chai, but chai before it became so commonplace and so sweet. The spices were definitely different. To eat, I had the roti, tarkari and dal-muchue and my spouse had the Sikar. We were both very satisfied. The daal was quite different in both flavor and texture than I have had before. The roti, too was a different style. The waiter is the grandson and told us it has been there for 30 years. We would love to frequent this place but are just traveling through."}
{"text":"This place has been here forever.  I've eaten here on and off for 20 years.  The food is just as good as ever but the service has gone downhill.  All they need to do is just listen and bring the food out--you'd think that would be easy.  But the waitress brought the wrong tarkari and forgot to bring the dal all together...then she got snippy with me for pointing out both.  The food was still excellent, but these people need to remember that the customer is always right.  The correct answer is \"I'm sorry, I'll bring the correct dish out right away\""}
{"text":"Fairly expensive. The food was OK, but could be a lot better. The samosas are baked and covered with yogurt. Not what you'd expect and pricey at $7.99."}
{"text":"If you haven't ever tried Nepali, this can be the place to start. You can never come across Nepali cuisines often around.   Not much different from Indian, but the spices used are variant and unique.  The service is good but the place is small. Accepts only cash"}
{"text":"I actually started eating here during a challenge that cute girl issued me. Upon saying that I'd try anything once, she countered with trying to be a vegetarian.  That lasted a week and I'll never do it again.  But during that, I found this place.  Not an easy task is it's almost a hole in the wall and will blend into the State Street image.  The majority of their menu is meatless.  And even back as my meat-craving self, I still love the food here.  I try to make a few trips here every year while the farmers' market is in full swing on the square.  This is a great place for a unique ethnic dining experience.  The type of place that Madison is known for."}
{"text":"Nice birthday surprise from the wife!!! Went with family and had a double date and tried a lot of different food. All of it was incredible. If you're in the mood for some heat they can give you a side to add and it's pretty hot but...what taste!!!! Will go again"}
{"text":"I'm glad I didn't discover this place earlier, as I would've surely become an addict. It is as good as everyone told me it was. Ate here for lunch and got samosas for an appetizer (those were actually the low point of the meal -- not bad, but not great), and the daily special combo (fantastic). Would pass on their traditional Nepali tea (maybe it's authentic, I don't know, but didn't have much flavor). Great decor, great service. Will happily eat here again."}
{"text":"The dal. The dal. The dal.   I lived in Kathmandu, Nepal for months. I have yet to find good dal in the states. Today I found it. Not only did I find amazing dal but the people here are so friendly. Great atmosphere. Great customer service. Fantastic food that brings me back to Nepal. Get your eat on!"}
{"text":"After a hard day at work, my friends and I decided to visit Himal Chuli as a treat for passing all of our exams. Since one of my friends had been here before and thought it was good, we took his recommendation and went here for our celebratory feast.  Walking into the restaurant, the first thing I noticed was how small it was. It was a bit hard to get to my seat without getting in the way of the other diners enjoying their meals. However, I sort of liked the cozy environment after getting settled in. It definitely made things more intimate. The ceiling is painted beautifully and all the decorations make it feel like you're in another country.  Being my first time getting Himalayan/Nepalese food, I was a bit lost while looking at the menu. So, naturally, I went on Yelp to see what people thought was good. Since I like dumplings in general, I settled on the recommendation of one Yelper and got the Momocha (a steamed, peanut flavored dumpling).   When my food arrived, I was quite excited to dive in. The presentation of the dumplings was exquisite and really made my mouth water. I took my first bite after rolling the dumpling around in the sauce they provided, and I was a little disappointed. The dough of the dumpling was watery tasting and the peanut-flavored filling was not very flavorful. I loved the sauce though! Perhaps it would have tasted better with the sauce on the inside or if the dumplings were pan-seared. They come in either 6 or 8 pieces, but get 8 if you're hungry because they're not all that filling.  My friends and I shared our food with each other and, after trying what they ordered, I think I may have gotten the wrong dish. Their food was very flavorful and delicious in comparison with mine.  I'm going to give this restaurant another shot and visit again sometime in the future. When I do, I'll update my review accordingly."}
{"text":"This is a small, cozy place with great, authentic food. Unbeatable prices. This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was fantastic! Really friendly and helpful staff, great menu selection, delicious and authentic food, daily specials, fantastic location, and good prices. Will definitely visit again and again!"}
{"text":"After the Himal Chuli's sister restaurant, Chautara, closed I cried for many months.  I recently dried my tears and decided to try Himal Chuli last night.  The food itself is amazing-healthy, fresh, comforting and delicious....emphasis on delicious.   However, the prices for the size of our dishes is why I probably won't go back. I had to give this place 3 stars based on the serving size (and I'm not a fan of grossly large sizes either).    Our table ordered 4 dishes 1) chicken buff (they were out of beef) and I now realize the waitress forgot to ask if we wanted soup or salad with the dish so we did not get it, 2) the largest size of Momo (6 dumplings) were great but at $8.99 it was a joke...there should have been at least 10. 3) Khichadi, which was exactly what I was hoping it would be, was just much too small and 4) the combination plate...which was good but again, too small.  $60, not including tip, and 4 hungry people....not great.    I really want to go back but don't want to starve!  No cash-should have been advertised better!"}
{"text":"Excellent and authentic Himalayan cuisine. Served quickly and hot (both temp and spice!)  the duly Tarkari was wonderful. Small and compact, but comfortable."}
{"text":"Here is the breakdown. The food was absolutely DELICIOUS. I craved it again the minute I got home from dinner.   The reasons I am not giving it was because out waitress was appalling. The place is a hole in the wall. There were probably 6 tables inside and maybe 6 very small tables outside. Our waitress was swamped with a full house when we arrived so we didn't mind that it took her a long time to give us menus and water. After people started clearing out and we were one of one two tables dining inside we would have to all three stare her down to try and ask for more water. Which she wouldn't even look at us and just blast by. We would have to shout to get her attention. The first time she returned with the whole pitcher and just said \"Here. I will give you the whole thing.\" Which filled the 3 small cups once. So we had to again shout at her after she would walk past us twice without acknowledging us.   Lastly, the bill comes and we ask her to split it since we all only have cards. She then informs us that it is cash-only. We were trying to figure out what to do, she points us in the direction of an ATM and storms off rolling her eyes.  There is no sign anywhere that says they do no accept cards. My friends' sister had to run home and grab a check.   With all that being said, I would still probably return even though there food is kind of pricey."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from this restaurant. The food came pretty quick. The lamb was delicious, but the portion is EXTREMELY SMALL. I ordered two entrees and two appetizer which was more than $50."}
{"text":"Looking at the prices I excepted authentic taste, originality and fine dining experience. It was Tuesday night only few tables occupied. Only one sever who did everything so the service wasn't up to the menu prices. Six pieces chicken momo was around $10. A lamb curry which only had a few small cubes was $16.95. It came with a very little white rice. The taste of lamb was little better than chicken momo but it does not worth paying that much money. The surprising thing was they only take cash!!! I wouldn't go there again."}
{"text":"We ordered the chili chicken and the green jackfruit kebab dish: Katahar Kebab. Both were tasty, but the portions were small and we left hungry. For over $30, I think the portions should be bigger. The dal was delicious. We were  impressed with the spiciness of the food."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dinner here with a friend. However, it is such a small restaurant and the tables are really packed in there so we were forced to sit directly in front of the door. I was very cold my entire meal and had to put my coat back on because of the continuous draft of cold air that was blowing on me. So overall i felt a bit claustrophobic. Perhaps I'll just stick to ordering takeout from this restaurant from now on."}
{"text":"Pure, perfect food.  It's the kind of place that feeds your cells and warms your heart.  Everything is slow cooked and made with love."}
{"text":"Food - delicious, but very small portions (I was still hungry!) Service- good, but waiter was aloof, not welcoming/friendly at all No wine - beer only No cards - Cash or check only"}
{"text":"We tried to come here last week and they were packed! This time we were able to sit on the patio for a 9pm dinner.   If you want a preview of the delicious Nepali menu, all you have to do is open the front door and take a whiff. We sat outside and every time someone opened the front door, I found myself inching closer and closer to capture the amazing aromas coming from the kitchen....cardamom, garlic, cinnamon, ginger.   They had an extensive selection of veg and non-veg options. I got the momocha (vegetable momo) which were filled with some tasty spicy peanut concoction. I was so excited to see Momo on the menu as the only other time I have ever had them was in the Himalayas.   There seemed to be only one server for all of the indoor and outdoor tables, but she did not seem overwhelmed. In fact, she had an aura of peacefulness about her that rubbed off on us and gave us more patience ourselves. If we actually timed it, the service would have been on the slower side, but it didn't feel that way at all.  Be sure to bring cash as they don't take credit cards."}
{"text":"I think people give this place 4 or 5 stars because they WANT to like it, and want to feel worldly and cosmopolitan. My primary complaint with this place is that it is far too expensive for what it is.   I ordered one of the chicken entrees, at $14.95, and it tasted fine- nothing special though, and I was still hungry after devouring it. So hungry that I went and had two slices at Ian's.  It was just one chicken breast with some sauce and a small patch of rice. It also came with a small bowl of soup, which was flavorless. This is not a fancy place- it's basically a cafeteria, which is fine by me, but why the fine dining prices and small portions? I'm amazed that people in Madison are willing to pay these prices for such small portions. I should say, also, that I very rarely leave a restaurant still hungry, so it's not like I have a super sized appetite."}
{"text":"Ate here about a month ago. Don't remember what I had but it was DELICIOUS. Had to write a review so I would not forget about this wonderful spot in Madison, WI on State Street"}
{"text":"This restaurant is so delicious and healthy. Many vegetarian options. Never had a bad meal!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try Nepalese food for the first time.  This place was OK...but the flavors def. did not wow me. I'm not sure if it's just the place, or if Nepalese food just isn't my deal.  Either way, this was decent food but I doubt if I'd ever return to this spot, sorry.  Portions are small, service was slow...oh and cash only."}
{"text":"VERY small inside, but I like that because it weeds out the people who are hesitant to begin with.  I LOVE everything on their menu!  The dahl is delicious and I have to get a mango lasse every time I'm there.  I've tried over half their menu and have never been disappointed.  I'm getting really hungry just typing about this place!"}
{"text":"They were out of Yak so I had the lamb stew. Very pleasant. S.U. had the cauliflower stew, also very pleasant. Another place just down State St. is run by the same family and seems a bit more carnocentric. Service was nice, cash only. I might check out the other spot before I return but in toto, dinner was quite nice and pleasant and I would recommend it."}
