{"text":"Great pizza for the price.  Pizza is always fresh and there is loads of cheese everytime we get it.  They also sell 6-packs to go so picking up pizza and a beer on the way home is pretty easy. Haven't tried the other food but would recommend the pizzas if you're looking for something that is way better than Dominos but the same price.

There is also a bar, I have sat there a few times while waiting for my pizza.  Prices are decent... they have some beers on draft, a few cheap wines, and a stocked bar.  Not the place for a cocktail but if you're just looking for a drink or two while you're waiting it'll do.  You can also eat in if you want.  And some nights they have homemade vodka gummy bears which are 4 for a $1 and awesome!"}
{"text":"Placed an order Friday March 29th 2018 around 4pm for delivery from my cell phone, paid cash no problem. 
 The next day March 30th at 7:45pm I placed an order a women answered the phone I placed my order told her I'll pay cash, she tells me I can't place an order from a cell phone. WHAT??? They need to have a talk with her!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery through Wheel Deliver. Do you like staples in your curly fries? Then this place is for you! I also ordered a large plain white pizza with mushrooms on top. They definitely must be using canned mushrooms. I took one bite and had to spit the pizza out. Needless to say, all of the food ordered from here went right into the trash."}
{"text":"I ate here for dinner this past Thursday evening with two other dining companions.  We decided to eat here since I drive by it all of the time and I became curious about it.  The inside of the restaurant is divided into two parts with a nice bar on one side with the other side looking a bit cafeteria-esque.

For dinner one dining companion and I decided to split an extra large cheese pizza while the other decided upon a chicken salad.  The pizza was as large as advertised as a 20\" 16-cut pie good and had the perfect amount of cheese to sauce ratio.  Overall it was a solid pizza and had a decent amount of quantity for the price.  The chicken salad was absolutely loaded with many different toppings including the chicken, lots of cheese, french fries, peppers, olives and more.  I did enjoy people watching here though and at one point while eating someone over at the bar starting singing a song.  Pretty soon the whole restaurant got quiet as the singer was very loud and had a beautiful voice.

The bottom line for me is that the food was solid and reasonably priced.  My only displeasure with the restaurant was that we had to pay around $.50 per person for the tap water that we ended up drinking while sitting in the restaurant.  I am not sure that I would come back in the future for the pizza but at the same time I would not avoid the place either."}
{"text":"Friday night not much going on so my partner and I decided to try this place out. We ordered a large pizza suppose to be 8 slices. The cook must not understand shapes because there was one slice that was about 1/4 the size of the pizza. Moving on, the cheese was plentiful and good and the sauce had a good flavor. Now the pepperoni and mushrooms lacked volume and flavor. The mushrooms were canned and the pepperoni was cheap. The crust was incredibly average. Good price but will I be returning? Maybe, you'll have to stay tuned!"}
{"text":"Capri is a lively bar/restaurant. There was a fun group at the bar on one side and plenty of room for eating the tasty pizzas, loaded salads, hoagies, sandwiches and more on the other side. I had the meatball rolls, an appetizer of golden puffy dough stuffed with meatballs and cheese then sprinkled with Parmesan and marinara for dipping. Yum. Service was great! Very friendly place."}
