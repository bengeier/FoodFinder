{"text":"Great grilled cheese and friendly service. Couldn't ask for more. Have tried the Big Cheesy, the Pig Mac and my favorite, the Leek and Mushroom.  All three were well worth it. Comfort food on wheels!"}
{"text":"I just experienced Papi Queso for the first time...all I can say is Delish! I tried the Mushroom Fondue and added smoked tomatoes. The fontina cheese was a wonderful marriage with the baby arugula and mushrooms and the tomatoes just added that special kick to the sandwich! I will definitely return to this food truck!!"}
{"text":"Gourmet grilled cheese, what a great concept!  My favorite is the Little Green Muenster, with spinach, avocado, muenster cheese and horseradish.   Their menu changes, so you might see different options week to week.  If you go to Food Truck Friday, you better get there early because Papi Queso usually has a line before they even open!"}
{"text":"I heard soooo many good things about this place that I couldn't wait to try it. I love a good grilled cheese sandwich!! They have lots of options so it was hard for me to pick one. I debated between the Big Cheesey, the leek and mushroom, and the #PIGMAC.   I went with the #PIGMAC sandwich, one of their most popular items, for only $8. It has Mac and cheese, Carolina pulled pork, and bourbon caramelized onions. I also tried the kettle chips seasoned with rosemary, Parmesan, lemon zest and truffle oil. The sandwich was delicious. All of the items compliment each other really well. The chips are also very flavorful. I'm glad we came on Saturday, I heard the line is an hour long on Fridays. After tasting the food, I understand the demand.   I also liked that you have the option to add smoked tomatoes (+$1) and/or bacon (+$2). Sounds like great toppings for the big Cheesey...I'll have to give it a try next time. They also sell a tomato soup which I'll definitely try when it gets cooler.   Great food served by friendly staff! Add this place to your list of food trucks to try."}
{"text":"Aye, Papi!  The worst thing about this grilled cheese food truck is trying to decide which of the drippy options to order.  I've had the Leek & Cheese (tastes like a piping hot bowl of french onion soup), Little Muenster (the kick of wasabi is just right, and not too spicy), and the Pear & Truffle (salty AND sweet), and have been blown away every time.  For additional sides, you can pick between the truffle potato chips (so gourmet) and the tomato soup (served in a coffee mug, this soup feels like a warm hug).  Everything Papi makes is cooked with love; get ready to stalk them via Facebook or Twitter to see where they're set up today!  (And yes, they accept credit cards via on-site tablet reader.  Too cool.)"}
{"text":"The food truck I look forward to most when heading to Food Truck Friday!! Have to get there early because it's that popular :-) How can you beat Mac & Cheese with various add ins on a Grilled Cheese Sandwich??? You can't!!"}
{"text":"Pig Mac is fantastic. Also had the Mushroom & Gruyere - tasty but even as a huge fan of mushrooms I still prefer the Pig Mac over it. But you really can't go wrong either way. Grilled to perfection. Side of pickles was tasty as well."}
{"text":"I was so excited to be in Charlotte and see this food truck at Food Truck Fridays!  A big fan of anything with truffle oil, I KNEW I wanted to try the truffle kettle chips.  Unfortunately, by the time I got there they were all gone... (of course!)  Instead, I tried a grilled cheese with pear and truffle. (I don't remember the exact name)  but it was the best combination of salty and sweet that all melts in your mouth!  To keep warm, I also had their tomato + tarragon soup... the creamiest and livened up a boring grilled cheese and tomato soup I would normally make at home.  This food truck introduced me to the endless possibilities to make something like a grilled cheese \"sophisticated.\"  My only drawback is that a grilled cheese starts at $5-6?!  I know truffle oil is expensive... but I guess that's what comes with a sophisticated meal, a sophisticated price!"}
{"text":"How do you spell perfection? P I G M A C! Love this sandwich. Although I guess it is really an entire meal! Two slices of bread, Mac&Cheese, BBQ, and herbs and salt.   I found Papi Queso about a year ago at Triple C brewery on Wednesday nights. I have to confess I now follow them and sometimes hit them up twice a week (once at Triple C on Wednesdays and Saturdays at the Sleepy Poet).    My \"go to\" is the Pig Mac but I have ventured out and tried the specials.  I haven't ever been disappointed.  I also like the chips!    Ask for a sandwich punch card! And get ready for the yum!!!!"}
{"text":"I spotted Papi Queso in Uptown during my lunch break and thought i would give it a try. I have never eaten from a food truck in Charlotte and was pleasantly surprised. I tried the grilled cheese with bacon. It was delicious. A  little pricey for a grilled cheese but i think i would have it again!! The service was a little slow but i like that it was made fresh."}
{"text":"Tracked Papi down one Saturday at Sleep Poet. I went for the French Onion, which was amazing!  I am already trying to figure out how to make that one at home.  My boyfriend had the Pig Mac - out of this world.  I had a little bit of entree envy with that one.  We also tried the chips.    I'm docking a star for the cost- two sammies, one basket of chips (eh, based on that portion size, I imagine you would get 5 chips in the \"cup\"), and two drinks ran about $28 including tip.    Also, given that they were at the antique mall, there's not really anywhere to sit.  I'm not sure why they bother with that location?  It would be nice of they could set up a long bar table (no need for chairs) for folks to stand and enjoy their meal - afterall, strike while the grilled cheese is hot!!  We decided to \"tailgate\" but I think next time I'll hunt them down at one of the local breweries.  Business seems to be good, and looked like there was a good amount of repeat customers."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried the Pig Mac and it was grilled to perfection!  They take cards for payment as well as cash which is uber convenient!  I totally enjoyed the food truck experience and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Yay for me, I'm no longer a PQ virgin!  I went big for my first time too, and ordered the Pig Mack.  Pulled pork with mac and cheese stuffed between bread slices and thrown on the grill YES PLEASE!  There are vegetarian choices too with leeks, mushrooms and roasted tomatoes.  A  fellow diner also got the truffle potato chips.  Sorry I missed out this time.  I enjoyed my PQ order delivered right to my table at Triple C Brewing Co. during a friend and fellow Yelper's birthday celebrations.  Washing a great sandwich down with a Light Rail Pale Ale, mmm, mmm.    Loved that I could pay with my credit card using Square Up and sign with my digit on the Ipad.  I love technology.  PQ also stocks Pelligrino italian sodas.  I chose blood orange.  Look forward to the next visit whenever the truck crosses my path."}
{"text":"The best Grilled Cheese I have ever had! And I know you are thinking its just a grilled cheese why bother? No! it was phenomenal! It had BBQ and Macaroni intertwined in the sandwich that just set off a euphoria of sorts."}
{"text":"I always look forward to Thursday's since the Papi Queso truck came to Gateway Village.  I love the Pig Mac, no onions.  Even the Big Cheesy & a cup of the amazing tomato soup does the trick!  Always grilled to perfection & the soup is piping hot! They also accept cards which is very convenient.  One my favorite food trucks for sure!!"}
{"text":"You know those kinds of meals after you eat it, you're already planning when you can have it again? That's how I feel about the grilled cheese and soup from Papi Queso!   First off, this grilled cheese truck is not your run-of-the-mill cafeteria grilled cheese.  This is nice firm white bread, perfectly girdled on a flat top and holds amazing cheeses and ingredients inside.  None of that processed, cellophane wrapped junk from your elementary school days!    The other reviewers really say it all...so I'll keep this brief.    I always get myself a French onion sandwich which would be awesome with just swiss...but also has provolone and mozz and these roasted, super sweet onions.  MMMMM I want one right now as I type.  I always add roasted tomatos if they're on the menu and get a cup of their tomato soup, which is like tomato candy.  It's soothing and very creamy...definitely not Campbells or anything you had growing up as a kid.   As if that weren't enough, a dollop of creme fraiche and drizzle of olive oil make for a double rich experience. Really, this could be served in a porcelain bowl in a white-tableclothed restaurant.   PS: The bread pudding is a must...and the packaging is adorable.  I won't describe the packaging for you, so you can go see if for yourself.  Track 'em down now!"}
{"text":"I'm typing this as I eat the PIG MAC. Words can't describe how delicious this sandwich is. Hoping Papi is at Food Truck Friday again next Friday because this might turn into a weekly ritual for me."}
{"text":"They honestly had me at grilled cheese. I got the sandwich with the pulled pork in the middle and topped it with some of their pickles. I would eat here again 100 times. The lines are always long, but they move pretty quick!"}
{"text":"On a rainy morning we were driving around looking for something to eat with nothing particular in mind. Then it happened... we passed the Papi Queso truck while it was heading down Central. It didn't even take a second for Ella and I to look at each other and know a gourmet grilled cheese was just what we needed. We looked up their facebook, followed them on twitter while we were slowly stalking them on the way towards Uptown.   Once they stopped we looked over the extensive grilled cheese menu and ordered the \"Pig Mac\", the \"French Onion\" and some Tomato & Tarragon Soup. Given the miserable weather we opted for taking our grub back home and enjoying it while watching Dexter. With sandwich bliss in hand we turned on Dexter and sank our teeth into our grilled cheese's. Both sandwiches were delicious but one sandwich stood above the other... the PIG MAC!   Its a grilled cheese sandwich with Mac & Cheese , Carolina Pulled Pork, and Bourbon Onions. Charlotte has many amazing food trucks and across the nation some of the best food is popping up everywhere except in a restaurant. If you haven't hit up a local truck lately you should give them a shot :)"}
{"text":"Grilled Cheese Foodtruck!!! 3 words, enough said.  There is a reason for the long lines and hypes for this foodtruck. The food is delish and the staff amazing!  My husband and I went to Triple C last night to grab a beer and something to eat at whatever food truck was present. Our excitement raised when we saw Papi Queso out back! Aren't we the lucky ones.   We put in an order for the Pig Mac (duh.....mac and cheese with pulled pork grilled cheese) and the Mushroom one. Also, ordered a cup of the tomato soup cause it was freaking iceberg like temperature outside. The Pig Mac was heavenly. I mean, this thing is amazing. The mushroom one was good too and a nice balance with the heartiness of the Pig Mac. Though, if I had to just choose one, it is the Pig Mac all the way! The soup was super flavorful and more importantly, very hot!  Awesome job guys. Looking forward to seeing all the new grilled cheeses that you concoct in the future!"}
{"text":"I track this man down on the weekends to find him, HE IS THAT GOOD. love it"}
{"text":"Update::  as promised I've been back. And back again. And back some more. I have tried a while bevy of their sandwich offerings and am never disappointed. The French onion is a classic as is the Pig Mac. I mean - mac and cheese, pulled pork and bourbon onions between two slices of bread and grilled??? Come on with that goodness!!! Although I'm not a fan of mushrooms I tried the leek & mushroom and loved it. Their menu rotates a lot so each time you go you can try something new. Be on the lookout for the Spanish chorizo and the chicken & grapes as some of their specials - you will not be disappointed!! Next on my list to try is their tomato soup!  I had seen that this truck was doing a launch party - a week after it happened!  I was devastated because well, I love cheese.  Recently while out at Salud, this truck was parked outside and I had some of the truffle potato chips and they haunt me.  They were unbelievably delicious.  I am most definitely going to find this truck and try more food of theirs.  In fact, I want to try ALL of it!!  Even the mushroom sandwich and I do not like mushrooms, but I have such faith that this sandwich will make my heart melt.  Can't wait to sample more of your yummies!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure at what point I bookmarked Papi Queso, but I had them on my must try list.  I recently started working in uptown and saw a flyer listing them as a food truck at The Greens on Tuesday, which is only a block away.  Luckily I looked them up on their website, and it looks like they no longer do Tuesdays at all and are now uptown for lunch on Fridays, some number of blocks away.  So on a Friday afternoon we took the trek to find this truck!  Sure enough it was at the corner it was scheduled to be.  There were two that we were interested in trying, the obvious being the pig mac and the other mushroom and gruyere.  It looks like those are permanent on the menu while they rotate others (could be wrong though?)  It took about 15-18 minutes to get our sandwiches completed, with a number of people also waiting.  Luckily they cut the grilled cheese sandwiches in half so I had half of each and my husband had the other halves.  For the Pig Mac - bbq, mac and cheese, onions, and well cheese!  This was my favorite of the two, just loved it!  The Mushroom & Gruyere - mushrooms, truffle spread, and cheese.  This was also very good, cannot complain one bit about this sandwich, I just happened to love one more than the other.  I am definitely eager to go back and try other specials and just get the plain mac and cheese one.  I love a good gooey and cheesy grilled cheese and these definitely hit the spot!    My only complaint, but it is a food truck I suppose, is I just wish there was better availability/hours on weekends so that we can bring family members on by!"}
{"text":"Got the big cheesy with tomatoes and bacon. It was good but was hoping for something more for $8 for a grilled cheese! Not something I could've replicated at home. I have definitely spent a pretty penny on gourmet sandwiches before but this wasn't worth the hype."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! We had been wanting to try their food for awhile after seeing them at Food Truck Friday but the lines were always so long. We finally got the chance at Southend Art & Soul festival where they actually won the food truck contest.  We had the lobster mac grilled cheese & added bacon. I'm not one for a ton of cheese but it wasn't overpowering and was exactly the right amount. The lobster chunks were a decent size too. Sooo good!"}
{"text":"I love grilled cheese. But I do not think Papi Queso is worth the hype. I definitely make better grilled cheese sandwiches at home.   Pros: the truck is legit. All stainless steel and chef's coats and proper restaurant line cooking. Also, they accept credit cards.   Cons: the flavor of the sandwiches is lacking. I wish they used some sharper or stronger cheeses. Here's what I've tried:  LITTLE GREEN MUENSTER: having learned from a previous experience that the sandwiches were a bit thin and needed more filling, I added jalapeños and mac and cheese to the muenster, spinach and avocado. What made this sandwich better than the others I've tried was the horseradish. It was creamy and flavorful. Had I not gotten the extra fillings, I feel like this would have been an extremely thin showing.   JALAPEÑO CHEDDAR: jalapeños, cheddar, bacon and jalapeño jelly. Too sweet, not enough spice or melty-ness. See photo for how minimal the fillings are.   FRENCH ONION: Swiss cheese, caramelized onions. No balance. All sweetness. Needed some sharp cheese or sauce to balance the flavors."}
{"text":"I happened across the Papi Queso truck outside of the Triple C brewing company and a buddy and I ordered a couple different grilled cheeses so we could each sample two. I can't remember the specific names of the items but mine was the one with BBQ pork, macaronni and cheese with extra cheese and it was absolutely delicious. The other one we had was a roast beef with thinly sliced cucumber and cheese and it was equally as awesome as the first. I also thew a little of their homemade hot sauce on the plate to dip the grilled cheese in and it complimented the sandwich very well. I picked up a bottled water and threw in a 15% tip so my total price came out to a little over 11$ which considering the quality of the food was a very good value. I'll definitely keep a eye out for this truck in the future and if you are a grilled cheese fan at all this one is one you won't want to miss."}
{"text":"This food truck is everything that I'd hoped for and more. I ordered the Classic Big Cheesy and added applewood smoked bacon and grilled tomatoes. With 3 types of cheese (cheddar, American, and provolone), it is any cheese-lovers dream.  It takes approximately 10 minutes from the time you order until you receive your food, so if there is a line, be prepared."}
{"text":"The simplest things can often times be the best things. Grill Cheese has found another level. Papi Queso is a favorite of my family. Great food. Creative additions. Super friendly service. Find them on twitter and make sure you find your way to their truck."}
{"text":"Def the best grilled cheese I've ever had & that's saying a lot. I have pretty high expectations when it comes to food and I was completely blown away by the Little Green Muester. Muenster cheese, baby spinach, avocado & wasabi horseradish. Divine. It was totally worth the wait. I will be back again soon for this."}
{"text":"Ummm yeah, what an amazing concept for a food truck. These guys are seriously stupid good. Sliced bread, melted cheese with amazing ingredients added, puts another label on comfort food.  After looking over the menu with my friend, I wanted to try every sandwich they had. Unfortunately, that would be to much to take on that many sandwiches. So we decided to get two separate sandwiches and split them. We got the pastrami and the mac and cheese with the pulled pork. Both sandwiches were amazing. The mac and cheese and pulled pork was by far the best one but the pastrami was good on its own also. It is just tough to beat amazing mac and cheese, delicious pulled pork and then more cheese added to that.   Papi Queso is a great additional to our already wonderful food trucks in the QC. Check them out! You will be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Food Truck Friday has a ridiculous amount of people and my wait time in line at Papi Queso plus the time I had to wait for my Pig Mac to be made came to at least 35 minutes. It's not worth waiting this long for a Pig Mac but it was ok for me since I was visiting from California and I'm not downgrading them based on the long wait. The sandwich was great and first time I've had this kind of clever combination of mac & cheese, pulled pork, smoked tomatoes, and grilled buttery bread. I'd expect a creation like this in a SF Bay Area food truck scene but kudos to Papi Queso for putting this out there and representing the Charlotte food truck scene."}
{"text":"Favorite food truck in Charlotte! I found out about the food truck on a food truck Friday at the Sycamore Brewing and have fallen in love since.  These grilled cheeses come to your liking, warm and cheesy. I tried the Pig Mac, which comes with heritage pulled pork, bourbon onions, mac n cheese and cheddar. Extra cheesy and extra good.   I also had the delectable tomato soup, it was so creamy and warm for the cold nights that have been hitting Charlotte these past months. I also got to try a special featured bacon jalapeno grilles cheese and it was very tasty with a nice kick of spice to it and it had bacon, you can never go wrong with jalapeno and bacon.  I'll definitely be back for some good, warm soup and the beat grilled cheeses out there."}
{"text":"Waited a while for this food truck! The line is always so long and after having the Pig MAC I understand why! The meat was tender and perfectly seasoned the Mac and cheese was a perfect addition. It wasn't too much it was just right. I can't wait to go away. Recently they have been uptown on Friday's near the Foundation of the Carolinas. So happy my co worker invited me to lunch!!!"}
{"text":"Best grilled cheese I've ever had. Definitely get the pulled pork and Mac and cheese sandwich. The truffle chips are also a must."}
{"text":"Just had the mushroom grilled cheese. It was delicious. Just the right amount of cheese and mushrooms. Grilled to perfection."}
{"text":"Another  Saturday night hanging out at NoDa Brewing and we luck out that Papi Queso is parked there providing food.  I have been waiting to try their food for a while now and I was not disappointed.  The guys in the truck were super friendly and very informative about their menu.  Fairly simple menu of different grilled cheeses/melts and a few sides like tomato soup, truffled kettle chips and pickles, which are all traditional sides for grilled cheese as far as I am concerned.  The leek and mushroom sandwich was calling my name.  Gruyere cheese and mushrooms, you had me at hello.  Chips were great with parmesan and rosemary flavors standing out prominently. I am usually not a big fan of pickles, but these were addictive.  Overall menu is pretty simple and I am not sure if they mix it up or not. Good variety of melts from 5-8$ and sides from 3-5$. They do have some extras to add to any melt, but I am not sure if you can build your own or if they have other options for bread.  Bottom line: I will definitely be visiting Papi Queso again whenever I get the chance."}
{"text":"Pig Mac was the best grilled cheese ever...who doesn't like pork and Mac and cheese. Love how they finished it off with a sprinkle of salt on top. My wife got something else at food truck Friday, but she kept sneaking bites of my sandwich because how delicious it was.   Tried the new meatloaf one as well, which was good, but wanted more of a meatloaf taste to it. Was hoping to try the French onion grilled cheese I read about...but it wasn't on the menu this time. Asked them about it and they said it will be back during the fall. Definitely will go back again, just make sure I get to the food truck Friday earlier, because there was a massive line."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Papi Queso now on two different occasions while at Triple C.  I would say both times, the food was ok.   However, for me, their grilled cheese is just not quite as good as the Ooey Gooey grilled cheese I get at Roaming Fork.   I know it takes a while to prepare food to order on a food truck, but it seems to me that they are really slow at preparing their sandwiches. I want to love this place, but so far, I find it a-ok, but not great."}
{"text":"Today was my third visit to Papi Queso, it's everything I love, a simple menu with limited items, fresh/real products, great service and Papi makes each sandwich as if it were for himself.  You can tell each sandwich is prepared with care.  I do not think I can drive by Papi Queso without stopping.  Warning Papi, I'm coming to get you!"}
{"text":"Papi Queso is definitely an adult's grilled cheese & I am proud to say, \"I am hooked!\" I can't believe it took me so long to try them out, but thankfully they were at the Southend food truck event on a cool fall Friday night.  I went for the Little Muenster & added bacon. While there was a minor mishap that took some time - a teenager took my order by mistake - an employee made up for it by not only giving me the teenager's order (a French Onion), I got my order, as well. This is customer service, folks!   First off, their truck is gorgeous; it's black & orange, which you can see from afar.  Their employees...so friendly! The branding of the sandwich boxes, which feature a mustache stamped on the corner, is absolute genius!  Now, the sandwiches...oh my! Perfect grilled bread on a flattop, with a beautiful golden brown color. The cheese...oooey, gooey, stretches- out-when-you-bite-into-it yumminess!   I am definitely more than a fan...they've become my favorite food truck!"}
{"text":"two words ahhh---mazing....and it's great that they do lunch in our area... Thanks Crystal for the find..."}
{"text":"The sheer fact that there is a food truck in town, specializing and capitalizing on one of our planet's most universal comfort foods, brings a smile to my face....and heart....and taste buds....and stomach. Had the pleasure of checking these guys out at their launch and whilst getting boozy at Triple C. Brian, owner, and his staff are churning out grilled cheese like mom used to make....and some mom has never even heard of.   Gotta hand it the menu for these fellas. You can certainly venture for au originale or something a little more on the adventurous end of the culinary spectrum. Can't say there is anything better than a standard grilled cheese, but the varieties with pork, southwestern chicken, leek & mushroom, and the dessert option with nutella are certainly worth shaking a stick at.   We all know a grilled cheese is best accompanied by soup, chips, or something comparable. Brian has you covered. Rosemary and truffle chips and the tomato soup are available to turn your sammy into a dynamic duo. Pair these jokers with beer from Triple C and you're well on your way to a fine meal fit for the streets of Crown Town.  Prices can seem a little steep at first, but do yourself a favor and talk to Brian or the staff about what kinds of cheese they're utilizing. You'll be happy you did. Also, they have Square, so those of you with no cashola, fear not.   Catch these guys at a food truck roundup or chillin' at Triple C!"}
{"text":"Winner winner Mac & Cheese for dinner! Papi Queso is where it's at! I don't think I can have another Mac & Cheese anywhere else. What I love about their food is it's simple, nothing fancy. It's just a classic recipe done right with love and attention. The perfect amount of cheese (though there's also no such thing as too much) and an even crisp burn to the bread. Anyone in town MUST try and find the truck and try their food!"}
{"text":"Papi Queso is one of my favorite Gourmet Food Trucks.  I have had three of their sandwiches to date and I like each one better than the next.  Today it was the Jack Turkey: roasted turkey, pepper jack, shaved red onion, banana peppers and basil.  With a side of their kick-ass tomato soup- its the perfect lunch.  YUM!!   The only sandwich I didn't love was the Pig Mac but that is only because I don't care for smoked meat, but seriously?  mac n cheese on a grilled cheese?  Again, YUM!"}
{"text":"Best grilled cheese I have ever had. I've tried the one with leeks and mushrooms (can't remember the name), and it was good, but I can't get away from the Pig Mac! Kettle chips weren't anything special when we ordered them, but still not bad. They accept credit cards and service is pretty friendly, even when they're busy. I'd give 5 stars to the sandwiches easily, 4 stars overall.  Definitely recommend, and we'll be back ourselves!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with a food truck that focuses on grilled cheese. I've been twice when they were uptown. I just hope they are able to get a new uptown location as their former Monday location is now a contruction site."}
{"text":"I really like this truck, but at $8 bucks per grilled cheese sandwich I doubt I will become a regular.  I will however tell you how much I love their gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches......especially the leeks and mushroom and the pigmac."}
{"text":"If you love grilled cheese, Mac and Cheese or BBQ - you're in for an amazing treat! They have mastered the art of grilled cheese sandwiches! Pig Mac & Roasted Wild Mushroom are my favorite!"}
{"text":"It's been over 24 hours and I keep thinking about their Pig Mac.  So simple but soooo very good.   Here little piggy!"}
{"text":"Best food truck in town! You know you will get a delicious meal every time you eat at Papi Queso. My personal favorite is the pig mac but I would suggest trying them all. You absolutely cannot go wrong. For an extra fun night I recommend finding them Wednesday night at Triple C Brewery. Great food paired with delicious beer."}
{"text":"Food truck staple for a vegetarian. Grilled cheese with tomato soup is awesome! 5 star taste with food truck pricing. The guy who runs the joint is genuinely nice and took some time just to chat with me. It's usually the same staff, and they get to know regulars' faces.  The tomato soup will surprise you! In the best way. It's creamy and a little spicy. I think they might throw some curry powder in there, and it's genius. Love it!"}
{"text":"Mac and cheese and cheese and melted cheese..these are a few of my favorite things. PapiQueso satisfies the need that I didn't even know existed in Charlotte for a grilled cheese, excuse me, gourmet grilled cheese food truck. I sampled the Pig Mac: mac and cheese, pulled pork and bourbon onions 3/5. The bourbon onions were a bit too overwhelming but seriously mac and cheese on a sandwich? Genius. I also tried the Dessert Melt: Nutella, strawberries, honey and bruleed marshmallow - amazing and not so fancy that I think I could make this one at home easily 4/5 and the Leek and Mushroom 5/5: Gruyere - you can not ever go wrong with gruyere, robiola, (which makes me think of the measles/mumps/rubella shots we got as kids- don't worry this won't sting, leek confit, mushrooms and truffle aioli.  Prices for sandwiches are $6-8 and I can't wait to try the \"small batch\" sodas mentioned on the side of the truck."}
{"text":"This. Truck. Is. Awesome. Tried the Pig Mac at a food truck Friday event in South End Charlotte. I was blown away. The buttery, perfectly grilled bread, paired with the super creamy Mac and cheese was enough to make you drop kick a unicorn. But that's not all, top it off with beautiful sweet smokey Carolina pulled pork and add in a smothering heap of bourbon caramelized onions and you have a recipe that would leave Batali shaking in his chartreuse crocs. Go get you some and wave  your grease stained paws with pride."}
{"text":"A couple of weeks ago I saw that they were going to be in one of the Southpark business centers so I figured I'd give them a go. The cart itself is very attractive, actually the main reason this one stuck in my head when I saw the notification. Service counter was nice and clean and the staff was very friendly.  So the food itself: I only got one item from them (because there were other food trucks as well) and it was the Big Cheesy. 3 Cheeses with herbs and sea salt. It was a pretty good grilled cheese sandwich but to me it didn't have any sort of wow factor. It appears from all the other reviews that I should have gotten something with meat to satisfy the appetite because I thought for the price, portion size was lacking. That being said this is one of the most well known food trucks in Charlotte, so yes I recognize their incentive to charge a bit of a premium. Your product is worth whatever people are willing to pay!  The only other drawback was the wait time, it took a good 15 minutes to get the simplest grilled cheese on the menu, from a cart that specializes in grilled cheese. Granted, this was an organized event of 4-5 trucks serving a very busy business center plus people stopping by just for the food.  Trying to stay optimistic because you don't know how badly I want to like this cart! Solid sandwich, just not blown away. I'll definitely revisit and report back on the Pig Mac, the Neapolitan Chicken looks good too."}
{"text":"Caught up with Papi Queso at the last Friday Food Trucks rally in South End.  Their menu offered something for everyone - the standard grilled cheese to the fancy schmancy stuff. Their special, red wine braised short rib with cambozola, caught my attention... Oh man! The short rib was super tender with a slight sweetness from the red wine. It balanced really nicely with the salty, creaminess from the cambozola. I can't wait to try more stuff off their menu!  Just a note... They charge a credit card fee."}
{"text":"I caught Papi Queso a few weeks ago at Food Truck Fridays in South End. After hearing so much hype, I was really looking forward to trying it, and I came HUNGRY. I split a green monster and a mushroom and leek with a friend, and while they were both delicious (I liked the mushroom and leek best), I felt they were expensive for what we got -- small sandwiches on wonderbread-sized toast -- and we waited for quite a while before our orders came up.   With that being said, they were definitely delicious: crispy and crusty on the outside and melty and warm on the inside. There were interesting varieties and flavor combinations as well. This truck is definitely worth a try, but be prepared for the long lines and to spend some chedda."}
{"text":"Not gluten free, but totally worth it. Any sandwich with bacon is for the win. delicious home made pickles too. Yummm!"}
{"text":"I was surprised!!!! I thought to my self $7+ for a grilled cheese sandwich??? But when I took my first bite, I was AMAZED. These folks know what they are doing. Great ingredients, fresh bread and friendly service= repeat business."}
{"text":"Most expensive grilled cheese I've ever had. Lol I guess you pay for the experience. This place inspires me to open up a pb and j food truck lol"}
{"text":"I freaking love this food truck. I got to try it Food Truck Friday and might possibly be the best grilled cheese I have ever eaten.  I had the Pig Mac: Mac and cheese pork shoulder bourbon onions add smoked tomatoes and bacon. Three of my all time favorite foods: pork shoulder, bacon, and mac and cheese. Amazing."}
{"text":"could have been amazing if only....... you removed the seeds from your jalapeños!! the tomato soup was good! cooled the burn."}
{"text":"Legit  The Truth  Best Ever   I don't even like cheese, so I'll start there. One afternoon I visited Papi Queso near the JWU campus for a sandwich, I've been in love ever since. The Pig Mac is amazing, I told like 20 people about this grilled cheese, which I call an adult grilled cheese, it was insane. Honestly, I thought I wrote a review after my 1st bite but I'm apparently slipping'.  Imagine this... some pulled pork mixed with caramelized bourbon onions paired with bacon and some good ole' mac & cheese and then more cheese. WHAT?   Just do yourself a favor, order it, then review it, then visit Sycamore Brewing on Friday night for Food Truck Friday and get yourself another one.    That damn bread is amazing too!"}
{"text":"When you go to a gourmet food truck specializing in grilled cheese, you know it's going to be awesome.  I mean, even at it's most basic form, it's bread and cheese which is probably the best combination out there.    My sister raves about this truck so when I came down to visit, she told me we HAD to go.  There was no need to twist my arm about it, so we tracked them down at Triple C brewery one night.  One glance at the menu and I knew what I was getting.  Their special grilled cheese for the night was a bacon, fig, and manchego grilled cheese.  The chef inside told me they put baby arugula on it as well (I'm not sure if he was just excited about the special or warning me so I knew what to expect, but either way I knew I was going to enjoy it).    We sat down inside the brewery and they brought our sandwiches in to us.  Each box is stamped with the papi queso mustache (which is probably the cutest logo ever) and a stamp to show what sandwich you have.  I got to try a bite of everyone's sandwich at the table.  The leek and mushroom was probably my least favorite, only because I'm not a mushroom fan, but it wasn't bad at all, just not my favorite.  Third on the list was the french onion soup grilled cheese.  It had a very mellow, complex caramalized onion flavor which was really, really delicious.  I then had a bite of the sandwich they're most known for, the Pig Mac.  It's easy to see why this is a staple on their menu, pulled pork, mac and cheese, yeah, it was amazing.  But the clear winner of the night was the special.  The smokey bacon, the sweet fig, the creamy melty manchego, and the mustardy bite of the arugula all worked so perfectly together.  I may not live in Charlotte, but Papi Queso is now on my list of \"must-go\" places when I'm visiting.  And if you're reading this, add this special to your regular menu.  Seriously."}
{"text":"As far as food trucks go, they do the trick. The chicken and waffles are clearly the Michael Jordan of their menu, but the rest of the supporting cast is definitely champion caliber. Would recommend trying this food truck whether you see it at sycamore brewing, or your local rally."}
{"text":"Papi Queso is typically a favorite of mine, however, when I arrived today at 11:22, they informed me that  \"the grill isn't hot\" and I had to wait \"15-20 minutes\". I was offended and enraged as I was craving a grilled cheese, but the venue was closed. I immediately left. Will probably return, but only because I can't cook a grilled cheese"}
{"text":"Pretty creative idea with Mac n cheese theme of the sandwiches.  I ordered the Pigmac, pull pork and Mac n cheese. It's good but nothing dying for, maybe bc I'm not a big BBQ fan. My bf have the smdk flank steak, which I like much better bc it's not as cheese as the other one. The only thing I'm taking a star off for it's the greasiness of the food. It's good for a big lunch, but a big heavy for healthy dinner.   The lady taking order is also very nice, and we didn't have to wait hour for our sandwich like food truck Friday.   I will definitely go back to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"So, I just finished eating this for lunch.  The sandwich was absolutely, positively, without a doubt, wonderfully delicious. HOWEVER, the value proposition is non-existent. I got the GC Cheeseburger, a bag of barbecue chips, a can of Diet Coke, and walked away $13.26 lighter. Honestly, maybe I just have a big appetite (although I ironically ordered Diet Coke), but I feel like I could very easily eat two of these sandwiches. Objectively, it would be fair to all parties if they cut their prices in half, or doubled the quantity provided at the current price point. I mean... really? They charged $2 for a 12 oz. can of Diet Coke.  Anyway, now I need to go get something with more sustenance so that I can finish the work day."}
{"text":"Very good. This was my first time here and a tried the Pig Mac.  It was a very innovative idea to put pulled pork, mac n cheese, all on a pressed grilled cheese sandwich.  It may sound strange but it worked very well and the ingredients they use are all very high quality.  If you see these guys near you make sure you stop by and try one of their many creative options.  I'd like to go back and try a few other options when/if they are near me again.  I also like they offer Mexican Coke in the bottle.  Always a good sign."}
{"text":"So to be fair I have only had it once but I think that was enough....for me.  After a friend kept raving and raving about the pig Mac sandwich I decided to try it.  What I didn't realize was that it had Mac and cheese on it which was just a little bit of over kill ....for me, add the pork butt and buttery fried bread.  It was all too much.  It was tasty but just a little too much.  The wait can be extremely long too which kinda took away from the whole experience and I wasn't impressed by the basil lemonade.  It was good but not great.  The food truck bar is high these days so forgive me if I'm being super critical but standing in line for upward of 30 mins for a grilled cheese sandwich with Mac and cheese and some tasty porkbutt (see I'm fair!) and tepid lemonade is just not my idea of a good time."}
{"text":"This food truck was the only one I tried at the Raleigh Food Truck Rodeo and boy did I make the right decision. Split the pig mac sandwich and it was glorious. As we were ordering, the gal asked if we wanted pickles, and it was such a delicious addition to the mac and cheese and pork. I hope they come back next year!"}
{"text":"Once you try the pig mac, you'll keep coming back and back and back and well you get where I'm going here.  I've been able to have Papi a couple of times, once at a food truck Friday night and another time at a South End festival. My most recent visit to the truck was today at Sycamore Brewing's Spring Fest (4-29-17). Still good as ever, if not BETTER.   If you see this truck in your hood, drop whatever you're doing and get in line. Order anything and everything, prepare to be delighted."}
{"text":"Fans of grilled cheese unite! Anyone can put cheese between two slices of bread, but Papi Queso makes an art out of it. There are many cheesy sandwiches to choose from and each one is infused with a unique flavor. I've had two sandwiches from the food truck. The first is the Pig Mac, which is a customer favorite. It's pulled pork with Mac and cheese. And it is as delicious as it sounds. The pork is seasoned well and the Mac is tender and cheesy. The second sandwich I tried was the Green Chile Cheeseburger. This sandwich is divine and has a spicy kick. I like spice and the  chiles combined with seasoned beef and melted cheese provides a delicate balance of flavors. I actually enjoyed this sandwich more than the Pig Mac.   Sandwiches range from $6 -$9 and that's just for the sandwich.  I wish the truck offered combos with a side and a drink. I don't like purchasing items a la carte. It gets too expensive for me.   I go to the food truck at Stonewall and College on Tuesdays. They do post their schedule on Facebook.  If you can catch the truck at a location near you, give it a try."}
{"text":"Since being on Diners, Drive Ins, and Dives, this food truck has blown up in popularity around Charlotte. And for a good reason: they've got THE BEST grilled cheeses in the city. They have mastered the art of the grilled cheese and you're cheese game is lacking if you've yet to visit this truck!   If you like your grilled cheese simple, get the classic and it'll blow you away with the multitude of cheeses that are packed in along with it's unbelievably perfectly toasted crust! Sprinkled with salt and herbs might I add as a finishing touch.  If you're up for an adventure, get the Pig Mac -- what's a better combination than barbecue and Mac n cheese loaded in the middle of two perfectly toasted pieces of bread? I will never be the same and neither will my grilled cheese game!   You can find the truck parked around charlotte (their Facebook and Instagram will keep you updated weekly on where they're scheduled to be), but you can always find them at Sycamore Brewery on Fridays for Food Truck Friday. A nice pale age and a grilled cheese pair naturally well.   Now go on, get your cheese on!"}
{"text":"I guess I'm being the gluttonous American here, but for $10 ($8+tip), I guess I'm expecting something with a little more heft?    Very nice service, a mild wait, but certainly not unreasonable.  And what sounded like an incredible grilled cheese sandwich.  Local smoked mozzarella, fresh made salsa verde, sounded awesome.  So I just felt a bit letdown when I opened the box to find a standard square grilled cheese, that, from the outside looked like what I could make at home.  Basic white bread, no cheese spilling out the sides, just a square cut into two triangles.  It tasted very good, not OMG-greatest-grilled-cheese-ever, but very good.  The mozzarella was delicious.  But it literally took me about 90 seconds to eat it and I wasn't eating that fast.  I guess what I'm asking for is a massive upgrade in BREAD.  Why not some big, thick slices of sourdough?  Then you could pile on more cheese and the bread would hold up.  Or at least make that an option for a buck or two more.   Food trucks are all about getting your grub on, and in terms of portion size, this just didn't do it for me.  If that's not an issue for you, then I think you'll love this truck.  Menu very appealing and service was great."}
{"text":"We were excited to learn that the truck was going to be at the Sleepy Poet Community Blood Drive and Yard Sale - Killing 3 birds!  Since we had a family to feed, we tried a sampler of 4 different sandwiches and the Bread Pudding.  They took a long time to make, which is understandable, but a bit unexpected on just how long.  We got the Pig Mac, French Onion (I added roasted tomatoes), the 3 Cheese and the Chicken with roasted Grapes.  All very interesting new flavors, for sure!  My personal favorite was the French Onion, while the Chicken at first bite was quite unusual, but I warmed up to it after a couple of bites.  Not a fan of the Pig Mac w/Mac & Cheese & pulled pork on a Sandwich, but one in our party was.  The 3 cheese was not anything exciting to any of us.  I think I was expecting larger sandwiches and/or a side or drink for the $, so that's why a 3 star, and the wait.  We also got the Bread Pudding, which was delicious!   And the service was very pleasant."}
{"text":"What a cool idea! Gone are the days of the regular degular smegular grill cheese - Papi Queso introduces up cycled selections of a household staple.   The menu offers a carefully crafted selection of different sandwiches, all of which resemble the classic grill cheese. I got the \"pig Mac\" which had BBQ pork shoulder, Mac and cheese, and bourbon onions. I added bacon to mine and enjoyed a Mexican coke. The portion size was great and the service was awesome as well. I was impressed by the flavors and the innovation. Can't wait until next time!"}
{"text":"I'm still working on my grilled cheese addiction after having one of these like a year and a half ago. Seriously. I got the Pig Mac and I still dream about it. I don't even know what else to say. Just spend the money and go for it. Sure, it's a little hefty in price but it'll make your taste buds praise God."}
{"text":"If you had told me last time I was here that my new favorite Papi Queso sammich was going to be vegetarian, I would have laughed in your face. I'm no Ron Swanson, but my diet definitely leans meat-centric. However, the pear & truffle has become my new favorite. Just when I thought the Pig Mac was the pinnacle of Papi Queso cuisine, the truffle cheese and brown-butter/honey poached pears beat it out. I look forward to going back to PQ & trying all they have to offer!"}
{"text":"Oh my wow! Just had m'shroom - g'yere with their special homedone pickles and...would do again & again & AGAIN! Best grilled cheese I've never done! Thanks Papi & the Quesas!!"}
{"text":"I ate the pickles, Neapolitan chicken and tomato soup!!! The bread is on point along with my whole meal.  This was such a great food truck experience that it was really gourmet food. Such nice customer service. They take credit cards which is excellent. Now I must hunt down papi as often as I can!! Their food is better than I've have had at restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I have only one word to say about Papi Queso:  Pigmac!!!  What sounds like a strange combo of the food groups, mac n Cheese with pulled pork is actually a treat to the palate.  The carmelized onions really adds a great finishing touch to this sandwich which was grilled to perfection.  I had this sandwich at Food Truck Friday.  I waited about 45 minutes in line, but this was worth to wait.  I can't wait to go back so I can try some of the other menu items."}
{"text":"Ay Papi! Ay Mami! Gimmee sum o dat grilled cheese!  I probably like grilled cheese way more than the person next to me, or the person standing next to you. My favorite is Muenster, so it was a no brainer to try the Little Green Muenster. A combo of baby spinach, Muenster cheese, avocado and Wasabi Horseradish sauce. The flavors were made for each other but I could barely taste the sauce and the bread was a bit oily/greasy. For a $7 sandwich I was hoping for a more voluminous treat (aka \"make that thing bigger guys\"). All in all, I would go back and maybe try something different, like the infamous Pig Mac or the Green Chile Cheeseburger. Their drink selections are crazy good - they even make homemade basil lemonade. The house made pickles are killer - I am a sucker for anything pickled! Okay, I'll call you Papi, but just this once!"}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place after they came to Whitehall ... the Mac and cheese grilled cheese was amazing even the regular grilled cheese was fire too . A nice tip get the tomato soup and dip the grilled cheese .. tasty!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best grilled cheese I've ever had. It has so much flavor and the taste is amazing! I got the pig Mac and the Mac and cheese is great and the meat is tender. It's a simple idea that they just kill! I tell everyone to find this food tuck! It's worth the wait and time!"}
{"text":"This place is unfair, ridiculous, stupendous, supreme and suberb. Calling these sandwiches grilled cheese is an insult to the mastery that goes into devising these culinary masterpieces of cheesy, crunchy, melty deliciousness."}
{"text":"Oh, Food Truck....where have you been all my life????  The only reason I'm giving you 4 stars out of 5 is because I couldn't have everything on your truck!  :)  Honestly, the Pig Mac and whatever that French Onion one was was BLOW MY MIND.....I would like to try the soup and some of the other sandwiches, which I will be doing on Food Truck Friday (which I just found out about) that happens in the South End every Friday night.....yes, oh yes....I've found my new reason for working out during the week.  To blow it on eating gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches. :)"}
{"text":"This food truck is mine and my husbands favorite at food truck Friday! The pig mac is always the go to, but last night I tried the green Muenster with BBQ pork on it and boy was it delicious! You do have to stand in line a lot longer than some of the other trucks but it's worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"Pig Mac is sooo good being that it's more than just a grilled cheese. Best I've ever had with that being said you must try it."}
{"text":"Had the mushroom and gruyere grilled cheese with truffle oil, rosemary and sea salt. Absolutely incredible, wouldn't change a thing about this grilled cheese. Thanks Papí !!"}
{"text":"We tried Papi Queso for the first time a few years ago about a month after they first hit the streets.... And it has been an obsession ever since then!  It's by far our favorite food truck in Charlotte (and the favorite truck we've eaten at anywhere, really!), and you honestly can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  The quality of the ingredients that they use, combined with creative combinations, and the buttery crisp perfection of the bread makes their grilled cheese the best EVER!  I know, I know; pretty big statement, right? Well, if you're questioning my authenticity, just try it for yourself and you'll be saying the same thing.  They have a general rotation of gourmet favorites including the Pig Mac and the go-to Four Cheese, but I highly recommend branching out and sampling the Green Meunster (spinach + wasabi + avocado + Meunster) or the Leek & Mushroom (this is waaaay better than the way the ingredients sound, trust me).  If you ever see the Lobstah Mac on the menu, you MUST order it! You can thank me later.  Don't forget to get yourself a nice cold Pellegrino and an order of truffle kettle chips while you wait, it rounds out the meal. Also, don't delude yourself into thinking that you'll only eat ONE grilled cheese --- save time and go ahead and order two. That way you won't have to get back in line later (or share with anyone else).  The staff and chef of this truck are so charming and talented, and you can tell that they are genuinely passionate about their customers and their food.  I can't sing their praises enough, but the best compliment in the food industry is a referral and recommendation, so go check them out!  **Tip: If you aren't into long lines, check them out at Sleepy Poet on Saturday afternoons and avoid the chaos of food truck Fridays."}
{"text":"I sampled several while at a Yelp event and was extremely impressed. The 3 cheese was by far the best \"original\" style grilled cheese I have ever had. The french onion soup grilled cheese tasted like they had trapped traditional french onion soup in a sandwhich.  The last one I tried, I cant even remember what it was called but it was my favorite. It had pastromi and i swear there was a slice of green apple on it. I bet everything he makes is just amazing.  The only reason I didnt give him 5 stars is because I hear the prices are kind of steep. I think that is because people are looking at it as a grilled cheese but its really is more of a gourmet sandwhich. If I see him out and about I will definately be stopping by."}
{"text":"Waited in line for 30 mins- they forgot my order- gave me a side of farro salad for the inconvenience...farro salad was spoiled and foul..mediocre grilled cheese is not worth it."}
{"text":"Found them at the food track gathering at South End on Friday night.  Great atmosphere, definitely want to do it again.  Wife got the Little Green Meunster and she said it was the best grilled cheese she's ever had.  I got a little bite and have to agree!  Later went back for the Tomatillo & Taragon soup and it was amazing as well.  I got the bread pudding w/salted caramel and it was delicious!  Can't go wrong -staff was friendly and I overheard some good recommendations/dealings with other customers.  Definitely will find them again!"}
{"text":"The recent trend of Food Trucks have me searching the city for certain eats.  Luckily, with social media, you can find the trucks locations pretty easily.  I first heard of Papi Queso at a local elite event, but then started coming out to Food Truck Fridays and Sizzlin Saturdays and Papi Queso is usually the truck that has the most people in line.  I would gladly wait for one of their declious grilled cheese sandwiches.  The ooey, gooey, cheese melting in your mouth and the crisp grilled bread that puts it all together makes Papi Queso (I think) one of the best food trucks in Charlotte.  My favorite has got to be the Pig Mac:  Mac and Cheese, BBQ, and grilled cheese delivery form = perfection.  Load that in with a cup of truffle chips - you are in instant heaven.  I've been super impressed by the truck.  The striking black and orange color combo on the outside of the truck and their super organized inside.  They also have finishing details, like the pig stamp on the outside of your box to let you know your PIG mac is ready and willing inside the box.  I know it's probably more for the sake of the friendly and fun Papi Queso truck staff, but I like to think there is an art form to getting/eating Food Truck food."}
{"text":"I've seen food trucks specializing in grilled cheese on TV so it was only time that Charlotte had its own.    This is not your ordinary grilled cheese.  This is gourmet grilled cheese with difference cheeses and added  ingredients.  So far I've had the Pimiento and the Southwest.   The Pimiento gave me a new appreciation for pimiento cheese and the the Southwest had so much going on that the flavors were dancing in my mouth.  Staff is great here too.  Yeah, Papi...keep it up!!!"}
{"text":"I like it, but it's a bit pricey at $8.00 for a takeaway sandwich.  I had something that had pork & mac & cheese in it & it was good, but a little heavy & buttery, without as much flavor as I thought it would have.  I would recommend them for people to try & if I see them I might try something else, but I probably wouldn't chase them down."}
{"text":"It is literally unforgiveable that I have not reviewed Papi Queso to date. Every time I have a grilled square from them I regurgitate the story of my first experience long ago. It was on the day of our shortly after they first hit the road grillin' cheese. They parked in the Plaza Midwood lot in front of Bistro La Bon. They were handing out ink pad stamps that looked like moustaches. All the clientele were cautiously having them stamped on their hands. When they asked me where at I said the only logical place for a moustache: my upper lip. The man with the moustache stamp was psyched to have his first volunteer to keep it real. To this day they must still have a picture of my ridiculous face plastered up somewhere on their website. If you see it, know it was me.  Whether your dig is the Pig (Mac), Mushroom & Gruyere or something not always on the menu, you will certainly be blown away by how complex a simple grilled cheese can be. These aren't what your mom used to make with tomato soup for you as a kid. They compile different kinds of cheese with unconventional meat \"formats\" and a veggie or two (gotta get your greens in there!) to make a simple melted-cheese-on-bread into something arguably luxurious. My original experience was with the Pig Mac. Arguably their namesake, it features macaroni and cheese with pulled pork and onions fused together with melted cheddar. They could've just stopped here...but why?? I have zero problems with anything on their glorious menu so I won't complain.  Let's not forget that they now have a semi-permanent kitchen residence over at Sycamore Brewery. (Perhaps the only thing keeping me happy at that brewery, sorry Sycamore!) And yeah, the price on these is a lot to pay for a grilled cheese. I get it. But I eat one perhaps twice a year. It's like a treat. Worth it! They also sell a big glass bottle of \"Mexican Coke\". Meaning real cane sugar. It's the only soda I'll drink."}
{"text":"I mean, can you really go wrong with grilled cheese? No. But Papi Queso takes it to the next level. They have perfected the art for sure. Boyfriend and I split the Pig Mac and Mushroom and Gruyere. Really enjoyed both. It'd the perfect ratio of crustiness to meltiness and the little sprinkle of salt on the bread really makes it. Mmm mmm. It's also really cool that they often do special menu items to pair with beer releases from Sycamore. It's gonna run you almost $20 for 2 grilled cheese sandwiches, but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I have no problem with the concept of food trucks. In fact, I quite like it. What I don't like are food trucks that want to charge you a high price for a sandwich - admittedly a relatively tasty sandwich - served in a horribly slow manner, especially in such a casual manner.  Let me explain a bit better.  Food trucks themselves are casual. I get that. I like that. I love that, in fact. It's part of their appeal. Walk up, get something, walk away. There isn't much service, because you aren't typically there long - but there is certainly a bit of friendly banter while you're there.  Hopefully you aren't there long. Think of the prototypical lunch wagon that isn't much more than a vending machine on wheels. These no longer exist in most parts of the country because of the upscale food trucks. That's fine - but the one thing they had in common is that you could eat quickly and get back to work. Not really the case with Papi Queso (and others, but definitely Papi Queso), even though most food trucks don't happen at work, they happen at food truck rodeos and whatnot.  It's also true with other trucks, but definitely here. You will often see a line of people waiting. Yes, waiting for their grilled cheese.  Now I get that it's not a pre-wrapped, processed sliced of American on Wonder bread, and for that I am thankful. But still, we're talking grilled cheese here. Works of art in comparison to those reminders of childhood, sure, but it should not take as long as it does, and it certainly should not take longer than it does to be served in many restaurants.  It defeats the purpose of eating from a food truck, you know?"}
{"text":"Probably the most perfect grill cheese sandwich I've had in a long time. Grilled perfectly with a variety of proteins such as pulled pork, mac n cheese, bacon, avocado and much more. I had the Pig Mac which is a combination of cheddar cheese, caramelized bourbon onions, pulled pork and mac-n-cheese. WOW!!!   Continued success guys."}
{"text":"The name should tell you everything you need to know about this food truck...allow me to introduce you to Papi Queso aka \"Daddy Cheese!\"   This place puts a spin on mom's classic: grilled cheese sandwiches!! No matter what you get you CANNOT go wrong! The cheesy goodness that oozes out of every bite will literally make you melt!   I have had the Lobster Mac, the Pig Mac and the Little Green Muenster! All were amazing, just pick your pleasure!  *dances away singing* \"I luh ya PAPI, I luh ya luh ya luh ya PAPI\" -- JLo  You're welcome. (\"De nada\" also seems fitting here.)"}
{"text":"These dudes are legit-- will redefine your idea of a grilled cheese regardless of what you get. I got the lil cheesy because all my friends had hyped it up-- but this thing is great!! Good dudes and you can tell their whole crew works their tails off!"}
{"text":"Got the pleasure of trying out Papi Queso for the first time at Food Truck Friday. The line was shorter than usual but we came early and it was pretty chilly out. The sweetest lady took our orders. I got the tomato bisque special and the bacon jalapeño grilled cheese! The soup was amazing and perfect for the weather. My grilled cheese was good, although I will say, to my surprise, it didn't pack much heat. I know some jalapeños are hotter than others but even someone sensitive to heat could have eaten this. Over all it was delicious, just wish my sandwich had a little more heat!"}
{"text":"I was able to try Papi Queso for the first time at Food Truck Friday, and the Charlotte food truck scene seems to be really starting to take off. I ordered the Pig Mac which is pulled pork and Mac & cheese between two slices of grilled bread. The sandwich was really good. Both the Mac & Cheese and pulled pork would've been great on their own, and when compressed into a sandwich they were very good. The truck just uses plain white bread, but it gets perfectly toasted and ends up working very well because it doesn't overpower the other flavors.  While the Pig Mac was awesome, it wasn't very large for over $8, and it took almost 10 minutes to make which seemed like awhile (maybe because I was starving). The food was definitely top quality though!"}
{"text":"Let's put it this way, when they tweet me about a special or a menu item coming back- I immediately go to the truck and order it. They know how to get me.   The lobster mac (seasonal) is my hands down favorite. They're all delicious- Little Green Muenster, Mushroom & Gruyere. Pig Mac is probably the one they are best known for (pulled pork, mac n cheese, bourbon onions). I love their tomato soup. I always have to order their housemade pickles. Recently, I was lured here by the return of the French Onion. And you're damn right I dipped a soup inspired sandwich into the tomato soup.   Follow them on social media to see where they are every day and to check out the menu.   This year, they were on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives with Guy Fieri. Spoiler alert: he LOVED them. Congrats to Brian and the entire Papi Queso team! So proud of you and all your success. You deserve it."}
{"text":"Papi Queso is the best grilled cheese you can get in Charlotte.  Forget the their pairings are innovative and can please any palette--they're expertly prepared.  The bread is grilled to the perfect crispyness.  So if you're a carnavore, go for the Pig Mac and if you're a veggie, try the Mushroom Leek. Something for everyone!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to this place for a couple years now. That moment when I saw a picture of Mac and cheese in their sandwiches I knew I wanted to try this place. So I will let you know this place is kind of pricy for the amount of food you get but it tastes amazing. I've haven't had a local sandwich in this area that tastes so good. I highly recommend this place for people who love a good sandwich."}
{"text":"Was it good? Yes! Was it worth the price? No. I can't comprehend spending $8 on a grilled cheese that wasn't very filling. Expected more cheese and a bigger sandwich. Still, a much better grilled cheese than I could make at home."}
{"text":"The best grilled cheese sandwich-keep an eye out for this truck! Now for the varieties-I'm not sure which one I like better- the truffle mushroom, the smoked tomato and bacon, the broccoli chicken, the pulled pork, etc.   I have visited this truck in several locations-outside OMB, Sycamore bacon fest, and outside the Sleepy Poet antique mart on South Blvd. Expect $8-10 per sandwich also sells chips and drinks.   Watch for it!!"}
{"text":"You had me at queso... being a huge grilled cheese fan, this was a must for me. I've had several different delicious sammiches at this truck and of course will be back for me. The Pig Mac is stuffed with pulled pork and onions and bursting with flavor. The French Onion is by far my favorite but unfortunately haven't seen it in months... PAPI! Bring it back!   But I always love the new flavors the truck is crafting and would love to eventually try them all. Look for creative fillings to tempt your taste buds (and stomach) like leeks, mushrooms, southwestern chicken and whatever else they have in that rolling kitchen. As a lover of all things cheesy, I feel this is a must. And their looooong lines at Food Truck Fridays tell you something good is always being toasty. You better brie-lieve it : )"}
{"text":"AMAZING grilled cheez sandies - you must find this food truck & try everything on their menu!!!!   Truly tasty!!"}
{"text":"Oh yeah!  The mushroom & gruyere is yummy.  Yummy nummy!!!  Nom nom nom!!!  It is getting to be a Friday staple for lunch at Sycamore!  Always nice with a flight of beers!  Don't tell the boss. ;)"}
{"text":"Shared a PigMac with my wife. Best grilled cheese in the Queen City! Almost ate the whole thing"}
{"text":"Papi Queso has the best grilled cheese sandwiches in Charlotte.  My personal favorites are the following:  Pig Mac - pulled pork, Mac and cheese, no onions   Pig Mac minus the onions and pulled pork, and then add Bacon. - yum!  Jalapeno Mac - this is a featured sandwich.  It has a pepper jelly, Mac and cheese, jalapenos, sweet tomatoes and onions.  Very nice combination.  I took the onions off because Im not a fan of them.  But for those onion lovers.... Keep them on.  All of my friends love this sandwich with the onions. :)"}
{"text":"SANDWICHES? SOUP? Ok, I'm in,  I like  everything I tried here, including the Pig Mac. I mostly stand against NC barbecue but when you put it on a grilled cheese.... well I kinda have to like it.   The truffle kettle chips were earthy, sophisticated, and delicious. The tomato bisque, though, was the star of the non-sandwich category. It's pretty awesome as far as soups go. Somewhere in the top 10 of my all-time fave list. So far.  Definitely going to have to catch up with them again."}
{"text":"This ain't your mama's grilled cheese sandwich... And I'm sure your mom's an awesome lady that makes stellar edible delights, but look... These sandwiches here?  They're on another level of life...   (I have to announce that they have a grilled cheese sandwich with pulled pork and macaroni and cheese... That's clearly my dinner the next time I run into this truck...)  I was initially a little wary after checking out the price board since we all know how much I love a deal... Yep, the sandwiches themselves start at $6 and go up from there... And no.  They do not come with chips... Those are an extra $3...  And since I ordered the Big Cheesy with smoked tomatoes and bacon ($1 and $2 extra, respectively), that put my order up to $12... It kinda made me cringe a little, but I sucked it up... lol  Truly, they had me at smoked tomatoes... I wasn't really sure what that meant, but the flavor of them is unlike anything I've ever had before... It's hard to explain other than just super tasty... I promise if you try them, you will not be disappointed... The bacon was perfect and stood up to the cheesiness without being over or undercooked...  When I tell you they butter the HECK out of that bread, please believe me... When I tell you that they pile that cheese and those toppings on before they grill it into golden brown deliciousness, understand that I mean what I say... And when I tell you that those rosemary truffle crisps are sprinkled with some incredible grade of parmesan, take that and run with it...   Yeah, with the tip, a sandwich and some truffle crisps cost me about $15... I'm fine with that... And as frugal as I am?  That's saying something... lol"}
{"text":"My 1st time at the Papi Queso F/T and I absolutely would eat their sandwiches again when I am too lazy to make my own...and that is pretty lazy! I got the cheese with applewood bacon sandwich, a hefty $7.00. They use a large, dense bread and there were 2 slices of cheese that were much smaller than the bread, leaving a pretty big crust on empty crust area. Their bacon is thick and I was able to adjust it so all the lacking space had bacon. I was impressed that they butter their WHOLE area of bread, just like I make mine at home. I didn't have any of the sides yet. I will return and see what I try next time. The people on the truck are quite friendly!"}
{"text":"Must love grilled cheese! I ordered the signature Pig Mac on a cold, rainy Tuesday along with the Smoky Tomato Soup.  Wow, the sandwich and soup hit the spot and was excellent.  The Pig Mac is a combination of pulled pork and Mac n cheese in a grilled cheese sandwich.  Here's my only suggestion: I think pimento cheese would have been better than mac n cheese due to the spice factor.  The pulled pork is sweet whereas I prefer an Eastern style.  Don't get me wrong, the sandwich was excellent and I will go back for the other flavor combinations but the sandwich could've packed more flavor.  The soup was perfect."}
{"text":"What a amazing grilled cheese, even the pickles were great. I had a smoked bacon and tomato grilled cheese.  I would go back for another"}
{"text":"Luckily for me Papi Queso has been at two breweries I have been to in the last two weeks, so I of course couldn't resist....the Pig Mac!  The Pig Mac is their signature grilled cheese, featured on Diner's, Drive-In's and Dives. However, the Pig Mac is not just a grilled cheese sandwich. Yes, it is a grilled cheese sandwich, but also includes shredded pork, caramelized onions and macaroni & cheese...yes, macaroni & cheese!!! The bread is grilled to perfection, with heavenly, cheesy macaroni & cheese and the pork, cooked and shredded, which makes for a perfect sandwich !  They also have a few additional menu items and typically have a special sandwich each night! All I can say is if you see Papi Queso on the streets, or at a brewery, check them out! It is worth a taste."}
{"text":"Pig Mac, you always make my day yay.    Yeah this truck serves the best grilled cheese I have ever had.  The soups you can skip unless its cold and you really want soup.    Oh and the sandwiches are kind of small yet so amazing you might as well just order two and double fist it."}
{"text":"Shared a Pig Mac grilled cheese with my hubby.  Big mistake!  Get one just for yourself it's amazing.  No sharing allowed!  Also did a side shot of tomato soup, was needing more.  Overall would go back for sure no complaints other then the price being a little steep."}
{"text":"Seriously what could be tastier than pulled pork BBQ, sautéed bourbon onions, creamy Mac n' Cheese all melted together in a golden brown Grilled Cheese sandwich! It truly is heaven in my mouth!  I ate what is famously known in the Charlotte area as the Pig Mac from Papi Queso at tonight's Food Truck Friday - South End. It definitely did not disappoint as it was as yummy as always! Seriously folks I go out of my way to stalk wherever they are serving whenever I get a craving and have to hold myself back from having a huge hissy fit when they are closed. It's just that good!  Anyway, the Pig Mac is definitely their signature item but they have many other types of gourmet grilled cheeses as well. My wife got the Little Green Muenster tonight which was avocado relish, a wasabi sauce with Muenster Cheese; this one wasn't her favorite as she felt that the Wasabi sauce didn't really go with the flow of the whole sandwich. However she has had their Mushroom one which she loved!  The only downfall is that they can run out of food very quickly if you don't get their early enough. Tonight they ran out of their Smoky Tomato Bisque and their Pickles. It was sad times not to worry I am still a loyal fan of Papi Quesos!!"}
{"text":"They catered my private event tonight for 140 people and did an amazing job. I had some issues come up on my end and they were more than happy to accommodate me! The food is DELICIOUS! Best grilled cheese I've ever had."}
{"text":"This is one of Charlotte's many popular food trucks.  They specialize in variations of grilled cheese, and they are all incredible!  The tomato soup pairs well with any sandwich and has a nice spice to it!  Your cup of soup is literally a togo coffee cup full of soup.  You could actually just drink it if you wanted to, but I suggest you exercise a bit more class.  Track them down and get your cheese on!"}
{"text":"Grilled cheese food truck, genius! I've ordered from Papi Queso a couple of times. First time, I ordered the lobster Mac and cheese. It was very rich but not as seasoned as I wanted it to be. I've also noticed the sandwiches are a little pricey but, considering some ingredients its worth it. I've ordered the green munster both times and I'm not sure how to feel about it. It's extremely creamy from the avocado which is yummy but, also messy. The last time we ordered  from Papi, the bf ordered the Neapolitan Chicken. It was unique with roasted grapes and caramelized onions but, these ingredients also made the sandwich very sweet. The basil lemonade for $3 is delicious! The basil just kicks you as soon as you take a sip.   I'd order from here again but, not too often. It can get pretty pricey for a grilled cheese. They are pretty tasty though."}
{"text":"I know what you're thinking... \"How can a grilled cheese food truck possibly receive 5 stars?\"  And that's a fair question. My only response is that you need to try their menu and get back to me. Because this is by far my favorite food truck.  I swoon at the thought of the leek and mushroom sandwich, or the one with smoked tomatoes, or the one with avocado and other green stuff. And it's not your average cheese that they're using. Their ingredients are strategically sourced to deliver an astounding flavor profile every time, with every sandwich.  There's a bit of a wait, which I count as a perfect opportunity to munch on the truffle potato chips. My only complaint about the chips is that they don't come in a 5 gallon bucket. So stinking good.  I've tried a lot of food trucks in my day, but the quality ingredients, consistent vegetarian options and finger-licking good sandwiches at Papi Queso make it my top choice in town.  And I bought a t-shirt. Long live the cheese stache."}
{"text":"Two words...Go now!! You will not be disappointed. Yes, it's pricier compared to sit-down casual dining options but that's often the case with food trucks. The pulled pork + mac and cheese + grilled cheese D-E-Liciousness was absolutely amazing. We ordered 4 (2 to eat there, 1 for a midnight snack :-) and 1 for my mom.) Even though the line was long they seemed to push the orders through pretty quickly. Just to clarify, we went on a Food Truck Friday @ Sycamore Brewery on a beautiful spring evening."}
{"text":"BEST GRILLED CHEESE EVER!!  It's rare that I give out a 5-star review, but Papi Queso cooking is just that rare! It's worth the 45min-hour wait at food truck friday for the best grilled cheese sandwich you have ever tasted. Not sure how they cook it up but AMAZING is what is served up.  I had the Big Cheesy with Roasted Tomatoes and Bacon, yummy!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Papi Queso!  I've tried a few different sandwiches.  So far, the PigMac and the one with pear, fig & midnight moon are my favorites.  I've always received excellent customer service, so that's just icing on the cheesecake... Get it? CHEESEcake  ;-)"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are good here, but they are extremely overpriced. I would want a much bigger sandwich if they keep their prices the same. I had the regular grilled cheese and added tomatoes. They had run out of bacon before I could get some on mine. It was still good, just not for $6. I had their kettle chips, which were slightly sweet and almost reminded me of Old Bay Seasoning. They were good, but once again, would have preferred more considering how much they were."}
{"text":"Hands down the best grilled cheese and best food truck in town. Every time I'm in Charlotte I have check their page to track them down because it's that good. Also very friendly people!!"}
{"text":"Good first visit to this food truck that shows up every once in awhile at the corner of 3rd and Tryon.  I've tried to go before but my early lunchtime stomach clock always seemed to be a bit too early for Papi Queso.  This time though both clocks were in synch!  I got the Pig Mac which is a grilled mac and cheese sandwich topped with pulled pork and bourbon onions.  The sandwich was perfectly toasted and crunchy on the outside and had a reasonable amount of filling on the inside that was melty, ooey and gooey the way a grilled cheese should be.  My only request would be more of the vinegary pork and bourbon onions to add more acid and cut through some of the richness of the mac n cheese.  All in all, this was a good sandwich served by friendly folks and I would not hesitate to stop by the next time our clocks align!"}
{"text":"This quickly became my favorite food truck because for my taste buds, there's nothing that can compete with their flavors. Plus, the awesome owners surely don't hurt my love for this truck.   But what is a food truck without a great concept? This truck definitely has found theirs. Their carefully created gourmet grilled cheeses are nothing like those your mother made, but that's what makes them great. Until Papi Queso, I didn't think I could be in love with each and every bite of a savory sweet and cheesy sandwich.  The other great thing about this food truck is it's very visible. Often times, I have difficulty locating food trucks; however, this one tends to be out all the time and is ready to serve."}
