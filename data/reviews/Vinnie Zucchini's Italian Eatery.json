{"text":"Didn't impress me at all. The atmosphere was nicer compared to frankies plus it wasn't as noisy as frankies and the food was a tad bit better...but still. The only thing I was impressed was that there were a lot more vegetarian options and it was a tad bit cheaper. Overall, I wouldn't go here again.  I'd rather spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer of Vinnie Zucchini. I have even recommended this restaurant to friends and family in the past. But yesterday when I went to visit with my wife, I was served some very bad chicken. I even noticed that afterwards, the owner (or whoever was in charge) realized there was something wrong and went to try it and then spoke to the chef. It seemed that they had realized the chicken had gone bad or something, and tried to cover it up by placing peppers on top. We did not say anything to the waitress, as she was very nice and we did not want to upset her or make a big deal out of it at the time. I will no longer be visiting this establishment, and will no longer recommend it to anyone. I really enjoyed going to this restaurant, but I am very disappointed and will not be going back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today.  The food here was somewhat better than Frankie Tomattos (a similar joint on the other side of the region) but there was less selection.  Vegetarians should be just fine here, nonetheless.  The baked vegetarian pasta, although a little odd (baked fettuccine???) was very good, as were the pizzas.  Ice cream was very good as well.  Chocolate dipped coconut macaroons were delicious.  However, the service was surly for the most part."}
{"text":"Went to Vinnies as a friends recommendation and the food was disgusting. The pasta was overcooked or cold. The pizza taste worst then (pizza pizza midnight slices). The deep fried calamari had so much breading on it and taste plain. The mini burgers taste burned. Overall go to Vinnies if you want food poison and have a large among of Msg."}
{"text":"Calvin says five stars.  Then again, Calvin only eats the pepperoni pizza.  Not a bad restaurant, decent food, but nothing great.  Most of the dishes are pretty basic and lacking any real flavour.  We've been a bunch of times and it's consistent."}
{"text":"I can not believe people actually go to this restaurant and spend so much money.  I went with my son and daughter and paid $99 for 3 of us and the food was beyond disgusting.  It was cold and tasteless.  My daughter had a bowl of mashed potatoes - shocking how expensive it was and what horrible food.  Never would I return or suggest anyone eat there."}
{"text":"To give this restaurant a 1star is being extremely generous. The service was terrible before I even got seated. I had made reservations early in the morning. Once I arrived, i did not get a friendly greeting. Not only did I still have to wait for a table, but they had sat us right next to the door which is completely empty and dead. I asked the waitress if there was anything inside the dining room area instead where the atmosphere was better. She turned to me and said, no, there isn't any. I asked what the waiting time was for a better table but she said she has no idea. Then I asked if she can check, she walked a few steps to peak into the dining room came back and said, no, nothing will be available for the next while. She didn't even try! I was willing to wait if she was more cooperative. I asked her again, what is the waiting time if I was willing to wait. She told me to go look at the dining room myself. WOW. I can't believe that was her response!! My boyfriend then asked to speak with the manager. The manager took him into the dining room area where there are MANY tables available. And their explanation was, \"Oh I thought you would want to be away from the crowd and be at a more quiet area\". Thanks for assuming and your terrible service. The food was NOT GOOD. Selection: minimal. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO SPEND YOUR MONEY HERE."}
{"text":"A disappointing experience at a premium price.  First, to throw my two cents in the Vinnie Zucchini/Frankie Tomatto war: the winner, by a clear margin, is Frankie Tomatto's. Neither place is great - I gave Frankie's 3 stars. But I will go back to Frankie's; I will never go back here.   Vinnie's charges about $5-10 more than Frankie's (depending on the time) and their food is much worse. Now unlike Frankie's, they have food that appears to be premium - they have burger sliders, seafood salad, crab cakes, chicken wings (and more) - so if you just look at the buffet you might think Vinnie would win. That would be wrong. Yes they have crab cakes, but they are tasteless - they're over-fried and there is no seasoning (i.e., flavor) inside or on top. Their pastas were all plain and undercooked, and their beef dishes were all overcooked. I've never had beef so tough - I had to spit it out. The sliders were tough and dry. Their seafood salad had crab meat that must have just expired, since it was almost as tough as the beef - again, I had to spit it out. Their vegetables were blander than bland. Not only did they fail to season the vegetables, they couldn't even steam them right - the steamed carrots were practically raw. The Zucchini was a soggy joke. Like Frankie's, the deserts are medicore and not made in-house - in fact, most of their desert items can be found at other buffets. On the postitive-side, their roast chicken was OK.   People don't go to buffets for the quality of food, but quality does matter, and it's clear that Frankie's hires people who know how to make food - it's not gourmet and it's not premium, but at least it is fresh and tastes good. Vinnie's food tasted like it was near the best before date, and then cooked by high school students. Everything was over or undercooked. And to top it all off they have the nerve to ask for $26 for it."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once during dinner and another during lunch.  I would recommend dinner service because they had a better variety of desserts, but who's really going here for desserts! If you're craving italian, lunch is very much worth the price.  The only thing i didn't like and I thought was very deceiving was on their website it showed pictured of cannolis, and when I went there none were served! Also my friend bit into a cream puff and it was frozen.  Overall 3/5 Go for lunch as its a better value for the price, but for dinner go to a real italian restaurant"}
{"text":"Came from Milton, wasn't worth the drive. Don't waste your money here. They didn't have a lot of selection. Pasta was good though."}
{"text":"I have not been here for a while.  One section of the restaurant is close, only the outer section is open.  The waiter is very nice and always smile.  Go around the table and there isn't too much food around.  The pizza counter has 4 kinds of pizza.  The toppings are sparsely distributed.  The taste is not outstanding.  Most of the dishes I look at them do not entice my appetite.  Either there is only a thin layer left or dices of meat, vegetables or fish at the corners.  It is Sunday at 7pm for a buffet dinner.  Come on, at least has to fill up all the plates.  It looks as if they are near closing time.  For the chef counter offers the roast pork.  The chef is so busy cleaning up his utensil and behind the counter kitchen.  He saw me but not seem willing to serve.  I have to ask him for the roast pork.  After he cut and hand me the pieces, he just throw the fork and tongs on the cutting board echoing a big metallic sound.  OMG!  How can he serve the customers like that.  Same for the dessert table.  Every cake has 1 or 2 pieces left and sorry they don't look good.  The caramel is the worst I ever tried.  Though the bread budding is warm and tasty.  Fruits include water melon, cantaloupe, melon and pineapple.    This is the restaurant that in years I cannot fill up my plate in a buffet dinner.   Sunday costs $24.99.  I can go for a much better buffet within a few dollars range.  The comment on the food is sodium, sodium.  What a disappointment!"}
{"text":"I'm huge fan of the rich Italian cuisine but didn't get that experience at this place"}
{"text":"This restaurant is mediocre, average at best and exactly what you would expect from an Italian buffet style restaurant. The restaurant was clean and service was good, yet the variety and quality of food didn't wow me. Perhaps I came to this establishment with high expectations, since it was recommended and I drove from Scarborough to Vaughn but honestly I would've rather gone to Franky Tomatto's or East Side Marios. The main dishes or entrees were literally the definition of filler food, it's good when you've been super hungry and starving but if you're coming for the taste and quality it's sub-par. The food is very hit or miss in consistency, you have to try and explore a little bit of everything to find the dishes that you like, and believe me when you've found what you like you'll be filling up on it. However, as stated considering it is buffet style the dessert options and quality were actually very good and I have no complaints about it. You'll either love or hate it here. Personally, I won't come back and if I had an option would choose Franky Tomatto's or East Side Marios every single time."}
{"text":"Not being a huge fan of buffets, my boyfriend and I decided to check this place out after looking up their menu online and being impressed by the sheer volume of dishes offered. Upon arriving at the place, we waited 10 minutes to be seated even though the place only had a few other patrons and tons of empty tables. When we were finally seated, an employee (owner?) was engaged in a very heated conversation about money with some executives directly behind us, which kind of made for an uncomfortable dining experience. Now for the food: although my boyfriend is a huge pasta lover, he was unimpressed with the large selection of dishes offered, nothing standout or spectacular, but then again the food is typical buffet quality. I was surprised that there weren't more pizza options , and the ones that were offered we're kind of dry and the ingredients weren't exactly the freshest. The worst thing about Vinnie's however was not the bland uninteresting food or unprofessional service, but the fact that both me and my boyfriend found ourselves oddly stuffed after just ONE plate, that wasn't even full! It was weird considering I can have at least two HEAPING plates at any buffet before I start feeling the damage. The only thing we did not feel weird for eating were the sweets, which are divine! I would maybe seriously consider going back to this place just for their sweet selection, they had ice cream, waffles, macaroons, cookies, and cakes galore! However, the food left us feeling sick all day, which was a deal breaker. Definitely would not recommend this place to a friend."}
{"text":"Food is nothing great really. To be honest, I don't think some of the food is really that fresh. It's also overpriced for what it is."}
{"text":"I went here with my coworkers. The restaurant has nice amount of seating and the service was good. The person at the door and our server were extremely friendly. Our server was very quick in cleaning and providing drinks... so the service was up notch.  The washrooms were very clean and nice. Over all the food choices were ok. They had a Pizza area, Pasta area, Grill area, sea food and vegetable area, soup and salad area and a dessert area. If you want to be high on carbs then this is the place.  Overall an average Italian restaurant with blend Italian food!"}
{"text":"Worst experience!   We went in on April 4th 2015 with our extended family, four adults and two kids. Had a bad experience at the entrance itself.   They said, there is a wait of half hour, and we were still thinking what to do, and the lady asked us \"So, do you want to leave?\" this is the exact sentence she asked. We are shocked to hear that, and no one would even bother to wait i guess.   We were highly humiliated by the way we were treated, and lost respect."}
{"text":"So they closed the location years ago around Dufferin and Steeles and this is what they came up with...just pathetic.  I remember going 7-8 years ago (close to home) and the place was packed, with good food, different salads and great dessert.  Not sure what happened, food cost? New owners? but this was a joke.  The salad selection is sad, not to mention not even 1 pasta salad really? What happened to all the different dressings? Cesar is all you can come up with?  No one ate the pasta but one kind, when it was over is wasn't refilled.  Some of the dishes are bland, or most of the dishes have the same marinara sauce which makes things just boring.  Desserts....ah what dessert, ice cream, some brownies and cookies game over!  The atmosphere in the place is like the food, boring!  If you want an all you can eat go Asian or better yet go to another Italian restaurant, avoid this place.  For an all you can eat Mandarin got more choices and even though I hardly go there I would recommend it.  They are hurting really bad and need changes asap!  Save your money, trust me."}
{"text":"The food here is nothing spectacular and more along the lines of what you may expect for a buffet that costs 28 dollars per adult.  Seniors get a bit of a break at 23.80 per and I'm sure children cost less too but I just don't know how much.  This place is separated into 3 main dining areas, one smaller table area with the bar near the entrance and the food stations area.  The different stations each have something a little different with the hot food all running in a U shaped perimeter with smaller stations such as the salad and dessert more of islands to the side.    There is a main pasta station which has a variety of shapes and sizes and different sauces such as spaghetti, linguine, tortellini, meatballs with marinara.    There's a carving station which doesn't look too impressive and the chunk of meat they had there looked rather dry.  They had baked chicken but all were dark meat pieces (thighs and drumsticks only).    Other hot food items included breaded chicken cutlets, calamari, cod in sauce with potatoes, mussels etc.  I was sort of disappointed to not see veal or if there was I missed it.  There were a few varieties of pizza too.  More common staples I wished to see would have been chicken wings of some sort (come on, it's a buffet) and a more impressive selection of meat.  Meat balls, chicken fingers, a sad looking carving station to me don't really cut it.  This place is carb central so if you eat that you're going to get full on sugar.  Honestly this buffet is not very impressive for the price as far as variety and selection goes.  Not having white meat chicken unless it's processed is sort of a downer.  Mussels are not as good as other shellfish where calamari is probably the best seafood item they have.  I noticed some stations were empty long enough for me to take a photo of them empty.  I had to go back to get meatballs and tortellini.    Bottom line this place is OK but not great.  For 28 dollars I'd rather eat a real Italian meal instead of having my wide choice of carbs from polenta, pasta and pizza which are relatively cheap items.    Clearing of plates and drink service is fine.  There's a decent variety of ice cream (about 8 or more different ones) and a small selection of deserts."}
{"text":"Ohhhh I'm so full. Here's my review:  Decor: Definitely has an authentic feel to it. I love it.  Service: Wonderful. The lady who served us provided great service. Although I must say that she didn't have a lot of customers to care for. I'm not complaining because she was very attentive towards my company and I :).   Food: I must say... that I was expecting more flavourful dishes. Also, I had a recipe with rigatoni pasta and it was not al dente. Another thing, the gelato wasn't creamy at all. The spumoni tasted basic.   Ummm... That's about it."}
{"text":"The hostess led us into the restaurant for seating.  There were many tables and when I passed by the buffet tables, I saw that it was designed to be like you are in a Italian small town with each food station resembling a different shop.  It was really nice!  I was so impressed with the wide variety of Italian food that they had!  They had a really good pizza selection -- all of the the pizza looked and was really good -- they had garlic bread, breads, salad bar, soups, seafood, meats, vegetables, and lots of pasta too!  In the centre of the \"town square\", there was a dessert station too!   The highlight that night for me was definitely the pizza.  I had the spinach risotto too which I really enjoyed.  I also liked the lamp chops!  They had seafood too in the form of mussels and calamari in tomato sauce but I thought this was a little mushy.  I liked the polenta too.    For dessert, I tried a bite of the chocolate cake and brownie that H got and it was pretty good!  The chocolate cake was a little on the sweeter side for me and surprisingly I found the brownie really good!   I later got a chunk of tiramisu and a slice of another type of tiramisu cake too.  Both were really good cakes."}
{"text":"For a buffet it's not bad. There's variety and all. I would give it a 2.5. It's not as much variety as I hoped For. But there's enough to find something you'll like and stick to. The ice cream was bomb. You're better off at east side marios. You get what you ask for in a buffet. If I would compare it to another buffet such as Mandarin I'll take Mandarin hands down"}
{"text":"I've been to a fair share of Buffets, but this one is definitely  1) not a lot of variety 2) over-priced for the available selections (2014 prices - week-day lunch: $14.99, dinner 21.99 | weekend lunch: $19.99, dinner $27.99 | Sunday and Holiday all day: $25.99) 3) inexpensive ingredients  Let's re-start this review with some positive notes: Nice decor.  Similar to Frankie Tomatoes in terms of inside decors.  Large washroom with chairs (which I was able to use to nurse my baby in privacy)  In terms of the food: - cold pizza - cafeteria style pasta - 4 large round cakes and some other small desserts  The only \"key elements\" during their holiday lunch was: - tomato sauced base mussels - cold shell-on shrimp at the salad bar - roast beef (not a lot of beef taste) - ham (but meh... )  Key elements of what I would expect to find at an Italian Buffet - selection of cheeses and pates  - portobello mushrooms - they should have cook to serve pasta with selection of base sauce - chocolate fountain - variety of delicatessen (their antipasto bar consisted of can corn, cold pasta, beets.. really? even Asian buffet has these!)  For a few bucks more, I'd rather go to Dragon Legend or Dragon Pearl for their wide selection of food - sashimi, sushi, peking duck, cook-to-serve diced AAA Steak, creme brulee, Lamb rack/lobster/oyster/crab leg (depends on the weekend),  However, if you want cafeteria pasta and Tim Horton's soup for $26 + tax, be sure to check out Vinnie Zucchini! ;)"}
{"text":"Delicious! Enjoyed most of the selection. What a great idea, an Italian buffet. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"To compare Vinnie Zucchini to Frankie Tomatos is waaay off!I have been to Frankie's many times and although it is nothing more than a \"canadian\" take on italian it has killer calamari.I went once to Vinnie Zucchini and I will NEVER go back. Anyone can say whatever they want about the decor..I go to restaurants for their food. This place is NOT italian whatsoever...the people working there are not italian...if u catch my drift. Pasta was overcooked, there was too much cilantro in food..and I hate cilantro..so the salads were no good for me..and then whatever i did eat..i threw-up for the next day and a half when I got home...I got food poisoning!!!so do yourself a favor...if u love REAL italian food..don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"Was interested to try this place as my boyfriend had recommended it.    Came for lunchtime and was seated at a table next.  Upon first glance it wasn't all that busy but it's a weekday so I'm sure dinnertime would be packed considering it's Italian food and we're in Vaughan.     Entering the buffet area, I was first drawn to the pasta table - big mistake!   Filled up in that before realizing there was still cod fish, sliders, and crab cakes... my favorite out of everything.  Any pasta I tried was all the same and nothing special, the lasagna was alright but mushy.    The sweets left something to be desired.   Maybe the cream puffs were the best of all I had tried - and I am a lover of all sweets.  It was also difficult to tell what anything was because it wasn't indicated.. So it was kind of a surprise to try everything including the ice cream.  They even had red velvet cake which got me excited at first but a little sad after.    Bill came up to approximately  $36.00 which isn't unreasonable considering the large quantities of good available. I got full."}
{"text":"I'm so upset!  I was there two months ago (after years of not going due to food going downhill) and was really impressed.  Well either they changed owners since then or they're back to their old ways, I hated it tonight!  I had a group of 13 to celebrate a birthday since I was impressed the last time, and what an embarrassment to my friends and family who came from all over to celebrate at this poor excuse for Italian.    As well, the food was cold, the service was horrible (never asked if needed more drinks, took food away when you weren't paying attention, definitely not worth a tip!  Save yourself the trip, this restaurant is a joke run by Asians and Indians is no Italian restaurant!"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong. If you're expecting fine dining quality food then you shouldn't be going to a buffet but this place will give you a pretty big bang for your buck. The food is satisfying with no shortage of options and the service was decent and attentive.  We were a table of 20 and staff were accommodating to our needs."}
{"text":"I love Vinnie Zucchini's! There used to be one in Brampton but it closed and I'm so happy there is one in Vaughan. I love the pasta here, I always leave so fat because I only eat pasta. Like four plates. I don't even touch anything else but I've heard the pizza is good. I like going for lunch it's like $12 on week days, kind of pricier for dinner and on weekends. My dad gets a senior discount when we go here, which I believe is 10%.  All you can eat pasta that tastes amazing? Count me in."}
{"text":"The problem here is the cooks don't know how to cook Italian and they don't seem to care that much about food,  they're cheap line cooks with no experience , most food items were cold or hard, my stomach felt unhappy after the the second plate of food, we barely ate anything and ended up with a $80 bill between 2 people..  no wonder they closed in the past, but reopening in an Italian area won't help.."}
{"text":"The broken heart rating is certainly fitting as this place has sadly fallen far from glory. All the food is so over cooked (or reheated) that it's dried out to the point of disgust. I mean really, when would I EVER pass on lobster?!?! It was dry and tasteless. Ruining lobster is a sin!  The pastas are mushy. The meats dry and bland. The only thing not OVERcooked was the tripe which needed to simmer for another couple of hours when done right.   The service was pleasant and good but the weekend prices are just unjustifiable given the dramatically decreasing quality of the food.   This used to be a family favorite. No longer I'm afraid. We simple can not return."}
{"text":"Not as bad as i was expecting... it is an Italian buffet, so don't expect Bymark quality.  The service was very friendly and the service was quick. Good selection.  It's not a bad place to have a small family party with kids... at least you're not overpaying for food your kids won't eat... i've made that mistake numerous times... Increasing the selection and improving the pizza (offer a thin crust option) and pasta quality would definitely improve their rating... just a suggestion :)"}
{"text":"I think Mike S. pretty much said it perfectly. This is the Italian version of Mandarin, a feed bag place where you can take out-of-town relatives who don't like all that \"weird Chinaman stuff\" but want to add another roll of fat by their 40th.  Buffets are generally not noted for quality and seek to (or should seek to) dazzle us with the quantity and variety. Vinnie's hits that marker nicely. As well, an Italian buffet restaurant is itself a fairly novel concept in the Toronto area and gains a point for that. The decor as Mike has well noted is quite attractive and I liked the Italian street front concept.   I thought the high point was the dessert bar. While the hot buffet items were quite decent the cakes, tortes, and pies were exceptional. They also had a dessert waffle bar and an ice cream bar. As is typical with these buffet ice cream bars, the ice cream is kept at about -70c making it nearly impossible to hack out more than 2 small scoops of ice cream before the 10 year old waiting behind you calls over his tattooed father. They have banana flavored ice cream which was a bit different.  The restaurant is in the strip mall complex on the north side of the Vaughn MIlls parking lot. Parking is plentiful. And there's lots to do in the area. There's the mall, Wonderland, Ikea, the Woodbridge Colossus, the smallish big box mall that rings the Colossus... This place one could do worse as a capper on a Saturday of shopping."}
{"text":"Italian buffet! Didn't think I could go wrong. But a couple of my Italian favorites were missing - pesto, good Italian gelato, and some good ole traditional spaghetti with meatballs. But I'm really just pissed off about the pesto.   My grievances aside, a bit about the restaurant:  1. It's huge and it gets super busy on Sundays. They have literally tried to fit a table in in every corner of the restaurant so if it's busy at all, be prepared to have your privacy invaded.   2. Sunday all day buffet is around $24.99/person and I'm not sure it's all that worth it. Other days are probably a better value at this place.  3. The servers seem super nice! Mine was.  4. Best entree? Four cheese tortellini  5. It's not all Italian.. Some med food as well. I was happy to see calamari but it was meh! I've had better.  Probably not coming back."}
{"text":"To say this an Italian Buffet restaurant is akin to saying that Venice is more beautiful than Florence.....it's all in the eye of the beholder.  While there are Italian dishes on the buffet (pizza, pasta, etc), this does not make it an Italian buffet restaurant. There is a variety of dishes, some appealing displayed (and tasty) and some not so appealing displayed (so I wouldn't even try them).  Service is very good....plates cleaned quickly and staff are friendly (plenty of hellos, etc.)  This place is very busy so there is an assumption that as it's a buffet, you're getting a good deal. I'd rather spend a few extra dollars and go to an authentic Italian restaurant where quality exceeds quantity."}
{"text":"Decent but spotty \"Italian\" buffet restaurant.  Decor is pleasant but I would not call it authentic - more a kind a slightly plastic-ey version of a trattoria.  Food varies by area:  Pizza was decent and antipasto area was good, including cocktail shrimp.  Fish section was very nice with excellent calamari and mussels.  Meats and vegetables were also not bad, though not everything was really Italian in nature.  Tasty ravioli, lousy mushy lasagna.  Cheap imitation \"parmesan\", not freshly grated.  Dessert table offered little that was actually Italian - no tiramisu, no cannolli, no zuppa inglese.  Pastries were a bit stale, bread pudding was quite good.  For the cost of the buffet ($23 for weekday dinner as of this writing) I think they could upgrade to some slightly higher quality desserts and accompaniments.  Also, I noticed that many of the offerings were not refreshed promptly.  I could not try several of the pasta dishes because of this.  Table service was friendly though plates were occasionally snatched away a little too fast."}
{"text":"Except the service, nothing worth what I paid for.  The pizza is cold, the pasta is undercooked, the rosti and grill are taste bad, only salads are fresh...I've read the reviews before I went there, so I expect a better dessert bar, however, the desserts are way below what I expect compare to Frankie.  Plus, it is more expensive than frankie, won't go back again."}
{"text":"Worst buffet that I've ever been to! They charge so much for a very small selection of italian food ($27 weekend dinner) which btw i think, is not authentic at all. Most dishes were very salty. Risotto, lasagna, parmigiana, calamari, you name it. And then they have 2 kinds of soup and both were tomato based which was salty too. Desserts are hmm just ok. Cant really say much about the service. Anyways, I have not enjoyed even a single food here. Its that bad. Absolutely my first and last! Please save yourself some money and get some happy meal from Mcdonalds. I know I should have. Sorry!"}
{"text":"I really don't get the appeal of this place, it's not cheap and the food is horrible. I went to the buffet, grabbed a few things I felt were safe bets to eat. Things that would be hard to mess up. I was so disappointed, I couldn't even finish the small serving of food I had gotten because it was so dry, and bland.   I will definitely not be coming back here, I wouldn't have come a second time of my wife hadn't twisted my arm having remembered the poor experience from my first visit."}
{"text":"Yelpers I'm back!!  My sister and I stopped by vinnies after a long day of shopping. We found the staff to be very friendly and we were seated right away. We dove right into the Italian feast and were not dissappointed!   Delicious pastas, great carving station for meats, delicious seafood and tons of sides and salads!   I love that they have fewer item's thank your average buffet but the food is quality. There is time and effort put into the dishes and I appreciate this. There's also a great desserts table and a section for kids :)  The only con is the price which I definitely find steep but as a once in a while treat it's worth it, though I wonder if you might find something more authentic in Vaughan for a comparable price?  Great nonetheless I only wish I wore stretchier pants!!!"}
{"text":"Sure, you can find what to eat there and it will be OK, but generally the amount of oil in every single portion they have there is just disgusting to me, gave this place 4 chances (2 of them was not my initiative), really not worth your time and heartburn!"}
{"text":"We came here after a long day babysitting and because kids are fussy eaters, we decided buffet was the way to go. Can't go wrong with pizza and fries for the kiddos. The pizza was actually pretty good. Thin crust and straight from the oven so it was still hot with gooey cheese. Other than that, it's easy to fill up on carbs here. Lots of pasta choices but I felt the same sauce based ones tasted similar. Risotto was undercooked, lamb was overcooked. I really shouldn't expect fantastic foods coming from a buffet but a girl could dream. This place got very busy quick and I noticed the pizza area was empty by the time I was grabbing desserts. Large selection, but mediocre food as should be expected for a buffet. Quite pricey but sometimes it's worth the sacrifice for the kiddos if it gets them to eat."}
{"text":"This place deserves zero stars. The food was stale and gross. I was at the grill station and witnessed a chef peel and eat a full banana behind the line. He then proceeded to wipe his hands on his pants and cook more food. I cant stress how many health and safety rules where broken there. The wait staff was even worse. My water didnt even fill my water until the end if my meal. I got up to get more food and they had left the bill on the table even though i wasnt ready to leave yet. Overall this place is complete trash, i would rather open up a 1.50 can of tomato sauce and poor it on myself then come back here."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed eating here.  It's a buffet style restaurant serving Italian food.  The service was quick and friendly and the food was pretty good.   I really enjoyed their pasta selections.   Plus they had a good variety of vegetarian choices.  And the desserts were good too.  I really liked the coconut ice cream and the coffee cake.  Their drinks menu had more alcoholic drinks than non alcoholic ones,  which was a bit disappointing because I don't drink alcohol. But the non-alcoholic drinks they did serve were very good.  Other than that it was a great experience eating here and I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular. I was surprised to see a large number of Italians here. I assumed they were food snobs and wouldn't be caught dead in a place like this."}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday. I liked the environment. Most importantly I was happy with the lunch buffet price because it's all you can eat. All of the pastas and pizzas were delicious. The service was also very friendly and super efficient."}
{"text":"Love Vinnie Zucchini's. There is no Italian buffet in Toronto which compares to this restaurant. For the price, you get an excellent array of options and it tastes truly authentic. Definitely go to Vinnies if you want quality Italian food... And on top of that it is all you can eat!!!"}
{"text":"For all the years my family have been to here, this has to be the most disappointing time. I remember when they used to be at dufferin and steeles. The food was phenomenal, the value and the quality and selection was superb.  Over the years, we've noticed changes the the selection of the food and is really disappointed in how it has become. Service is still great but the food has definitely gone downhill.  So sad."}
