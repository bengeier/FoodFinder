{"text":"I have been going to this Chinese Restaurant for years. The food is amazing. I have only eaten inside of here once (it's super creepy) so I got take out every time. The food is amazing, but I am giving it a one star because the woman that runs the business is the rudest, most miserable woman I have ever met. I literally have never seen this woman smile. A recent experience with this woman turned me off from this place forever.

You would think that someone would be even the littlest bit courteous to a customer that they see literally every other week for the past ten years. Lost my business! Sorry lady, but that is what happens when you hate everything in your life."}
{"text":"Bland, not ordering here again !!! Tasteless bullshit! Horrible !! Please do yourself a favor and don't order their food!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to have to post this, because this intrepid little restaurant has been in business for a long time. My parents used to come all the way to Canonsburg from Bridgeville because they liked the hot and sour soup. 
I've tried it twice, and give it 2 nopes up. Lemon Chicken was dry even after it was drenched in the sugary lemon sauce and was more breading than meat. Seafood Delight consisted of a lot of cheap, mealy Surimi, scallops that were undoubtedly white fish cut into circles, plenty of shrimp (hurray for that!) and at the bottom of the container a hunk of what might have been lobster. The General Tso's, the only Chinese food my husband enjoys, was more breading than meat.
Update: can't really blame the meal, but i was violently ill 24 hours after that meal. Threw away the leftovers."}
{"text":"I love me some classic American Chinese food. You know what I mean, greasy and sweet and fried and just all around delicious. Panda Chinese Kitchen is a talented purveyor of this lauded cuisine.

There are a few mainstays I always stick to when getting their takeout. General Tso's Chicken which is of course tangy/sweet, boneless BBQ spareribs that are almost never dry and wonton soup. Egg rolls too, but they can be a bit mushy on occasion. Their broccoli in brown sauce is also solid.

All in all, this place is cheap and fast and hardly a letdown. I will certainly keep going back and can confidently recommend."}
