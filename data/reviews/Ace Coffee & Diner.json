{"text":"Really yummy late breakfast and smoothies. I go there almost every weekend with my family. Love the skillets and avocado toast!  And Nutella Latte Can't say no to!"}
{"text":"Hit & Miss...  My girlfriend and I went for brunch and arrived at 10am. Our waitress took our drink order at around 10:15am and then disappeared or forgot us. Finally we found someone who took our order at 11am.  The service was slow but I did enjoy my food."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service! I was a bit wary coming in after reading reviews but the service was awesome and we loved our meal."}
{"text":"ACE is my go-to for my morning coffee. Can't beat $1 coffee before 9am on weekdays! The breakfast is delicious as well!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice.  Both times my friend and I each had coffee and shared a salad.  In both cases, the food and service were very good.  We were able to stay as long as we wanted and the servers were kind in checking in for coffee refills.  I caught the name of our server ton the secon visit.  His name is Gabriel and he is a very pleasant person and attentive to our needs/wants.  He even surprised us with a to-go coffee when we finished up.  I will definitely be going back for more!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try out a new breakfast place... But I was left very disappointed. The first time I went was their grand opening Saturday. The service was very poor, but I chalked it up to it being busy and new. The food was mediocre at best and cold. Like another reviewer I had the Eggs Benedict with Salmon.  I decided to give it another chance about a month later and try out a new dish. I had the mushroom Omelet. It was completely burned on the bottom and obviously the eggs were then extremely dry. I realized then that this was not somewhere I wanted to waste my money on. The waitress was the same as last time and her service did not improve at all.  The only positive I will give them is that their Spanish Latte is quite nice!"}
{"text":"The food was ok but not worth the price. Paid $15 for bacon and eggs and they only give you a single slice of toast! Better off at Belmont or Diner Deluxe where you get bottomless toast and hash browns and less expensive.  Coffee is better at Starbucks"}
{"text":"We went to this place on Sunday morning for brunch. Service was friendly but slow. It took us long to be seated although it was not busy. Food was ok and coffee was descent."}
{"text":"Went for the first time this morning. Messed up my order- I'm not usually one to make a scene.. But the waitress who was working made me out to be a liar, when she repeated our orders back to us while we ordered it... and rolled her eyes in annoyance. Never going again. Disgusted. Good food but you lost a potential loyal customer guys!!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to Ace was on the day after they opened. Understandably things were a bit spotty. I took my son there for dinner tonight and the food and service could not have been better! My son tried a sour dough French Toast that was a brand new special on the menu and he was the first person to try it. Big smiles!  Awesome dinner!"}
{"text":"We came here once for brunch and we enjoyed the food. The service was quick and the atmosphere was nice. We decided to come back again. I called last week to ask if we could order take out and they said the kitchen had closed early because the cook had a migraine. Annoying but understandable. So we came here on Tuesday May 24th at 4:50pm. They were closed even though they were supposed to be open until 8pm (according to their website). We tried again tonight (May 26th) at 5:20pm. Again, they're supposed to be open until 8pm and they were closed once again. We won't bother with this place again because apparently being open during the hours they're supposed to be doesn't matter to the people who run this place."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place, from the breakfast burger to the chicken and waffles to the pancakes. They sell Modern Jelly donuts and run Phil and Sebastions Coffee. The Nutella latte alone is worth going for.   My fav dish so far is the breakfast burger. Perfectly cooked, juicy and beefy with a perfectly cooked egg, hollandaise and pancetta crisps. The hashbrowns are cooked perfectly, mini potatoes done crispy and seasoned on the outside, light and fluffy on the inside.   A must visit if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Terrible service and mediocre food. We sat for ten minutes before asking at the counter for service, then five minutes after placing our order the server who was supposed to be helping our section tried to drop off menus. Food was lukewarm and came out wrong, the server brought one of us cutlery wrapped in a napkin and the other individual cutlery with no napkin. Won't be going back. Disappointing because the diner itself seems quite nice, we expected more."}
{"text":"A new breakfast place in Calgary! Near where I live? Sign me up.   To start, I go here nearly every second morning for their coffee alone at 7am. They brew Phil and Sebastian coffee and also make a mean Nutella Latte. They also have fresh pastries and sandwiches to go.  Next is there in house service. Everyone in there is very friendly and excited to serve you. It's rare to get this kind of service anymore. They also seem to make an effort to get to know you.   Their best food is hard to choose but my wife and I tried the Croque Madame and the Pancetta Eggs Benny and they were so good. Also there are no better side potatoes in Calgary. They are crispy and soft at the same time. Boom.   If you are looking for something sweet, grab their French toast. It's to die for. Overall I think my favourite Calgary breakfast place. Couldn't recommend it more!   Go be awesome at Ace!"}
{"text":"This place used to do a mean smoked salmon eggs Benedict, but today I discovered it is no longer a good breakfast place. For $15 for eggs Benedict I expect runny poached eggs and actual smoked salmon. But not this one, I had actual canned salmon, a smear of avocado, and hard poached eggs. The waitress didn't even ask for how my eggs were to be done. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Very expensive.  Service was slow and food was cold. Banana bread was very dry and crumbly. Eggs Benedict had cold and dry English muffins. Potatoes were good but that's about it. Diner vibe, but without the affordable food and prompt service.  We had much better luck with their takeout menu which was fun and relatively fast. Still very expensive but they had some nice offering for takeout."}
{"text":"Good neighbourhood breakfast place.  We got the table right away at 11am.  Interior design is very modern and nice.  I had forest mushroom omelette with goat cheese and it was pretty good.  For eggs benedict they use medium size eggs not large so they are quite small. Also, we were not asked how we want our eggs benedict ( soft/medium/ hard).  The potatoes are smashed baby potatoes which is a cool concept but they were over-fried so really dark brown color. I think if they were a bit less fried, they would have had better texture.  Coffee was good, even plain black coffee was not bitter or sour.  Overall for 4 people with specialty coffees it was $90 so on a pricey side.  I would go there because I live 2 minutes away but I wouldn't drive there if I lived far away."}
{"text":"Arrive.  No greeter. Appears to be a seat yourself arrangement unless you manage to actually be greeted. We sit down. Ignored for 10 minutes after being walked by many times.  Ask for a menu.  Wait another 10 minutes. Nobody comes around at all.  Son says dad lets go.  We go to 722.  Greeted with a smile and served right away.  Get it together ace. Sheesh."}
{"text":"Another restaurant has opened to serve the seemingly endless desire of Calgarians for a place to enjoy breakfast and brunch.  Ace Coffee & Diner is similar to the likes of Diner Deluxe and the Beltliner. Serving both classic and trendy breakfast items (along with a more limited lunch menu), the restaurant places a lot of focus on locally sourced ingredients.   On my first visit, I tried the breakfast sandwich which included an over easy egg and fig jam on a brioche bun. The highlight of the dish was the smashed baby potatoes on the side.  Phil and Sebastian coffee is the available brew. In addition to standard coffee and lattes, the restaurant also offers fancier flavours for their coffee drinks including Nutella, ducle and Spanich lattes.  The restaurant advertises their baked goods as being made fresh on site. On this visit, they had a small selection of cookies and scones plus one variety of donut from Jelly Modern.   The prices are a little higher than standard diner breakfasts, but I feel its worth it for the better quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Good breakfast place on the west side of the city. Their address can be a bit tricky to find but it's in the shopping complex, don't pay too much attention to the exact address your GPS will want to bring you to. Simple basic breakfast menu featuring all the classics. We both ordered coffee and the breakfast poutine. There were some good looking smoothies on the menu as well but I didn't order any of them. The staff were friendly and attentive with the coffee, love constant refills, even if it means I end up drinking way too much coffee. Cute decor and bright inside. Out of the way for me but was meeting a friend who had an appointment in the complex so it worked out."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place. But man, too many problems to overlook.  The smoked salmon bennies is gross. Who thought cold lox +hot eggs was a good idea? Tip to the chef, just put that strip on the grill for 30 seconds and it would be fine.  Our burger we ordered came without, any toppings?? And when pointed out it was rushed to the back woth toppings slapped onto it. Waitress was super apologetic but cmon man. Weve had to send food back twice because of kitchen mishaps now (the other being cold eggs). Thats 2 out of 3 trips.  Then our table had no sugar/condements on it and we had to grab it ourselves. Granted our table was one of the bar tops that looks out to the window but at least sugar and salt+pepper shouldve been there.   Food is otherwise p good if not pricy. Atmosphere is nice too, but if wait staff and kitchen cant handle being busy all the time and still make mistakes thennn..."}
{"text":"Good food and nice ambiance.  Refreshing atmosphere far different than chain restaurants.  A bit more than some places, but great quality.  Staff are friendly and lots of parking."}
{"text":"I am giving this two stars for the service and atmosphere; the food would be a zero.  Worst omelette I have ever had and my son who normally eats anything could barely touch his pancakes.  No wonder this place was totally empty during peak business hours.  The bathroom was not overly clean either. Shame given the servers are super sweet and the decor is nice, so much potential.  Chef needs some training though."}
{"text":"I enjoy this place because it's close and I love the atmosphere. I find the service starts out really good and then they forget about you. I waited almost a half hour for someone to ask me if I wanted a bill and I could hardly make eye contact with anyone to even ask for one. It was not busy, 10:30 on a Tuesday. After we got our food our waitress never came back once to ask if we wanted anything. I've also had this happen before where they just forget you're there. I like it but I don't want to spend my whole day there without even a hot water top up for my tea. I also agree with other posters about 1 slice of toast, come on that's ridiculous, I have never been anywhere that gives you only 1 slice of toast. That being said, the banana bread French toast is awesome and their kids menu is excellent. The Little Ace Breakfast is perfect for my 4 year old, he cleans his plate every time. I'll go back and keep hoping the service stays good from beginning to end."}
{"text":"Cool space but that's it. Service was average to slow but very friendly. Don't sit by the door! Cold draft kept coming in.  Had the eggs Benny with salmon. Were those robins eggs?? Holy crap, smallest eggs ever! Especially considering it was EGGS Benny!! Way too much salmon stacked on a bleh muffin. Hollandaise sauce lacked ANY flavor whatsoever! And to top it off it was all cold.   It's got possibility but the food quality and service needs to improve for the price they charge!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast place with a simple menu and Phil & Sebastian coffee.   Two entrances,  one for take out and their coffee and bakery counter.   The service is very friendly and the decor is fun.   The prices for their food and drinks is pretty high,  buy its a nice treat once in awhile.   Their almond croissants are amazing!"}
