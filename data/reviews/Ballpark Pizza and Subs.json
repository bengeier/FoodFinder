{"text":"I like this place for their lunch special.  You can get two large slices of cheese pizza and a soda for around $5.00 - which beats the heck out of a combo-burger meal any day in my book. I wouldn't necessarily say the pizza is cookie-cutter generic, although it's exactly what you'd expect from a mom & pop family pizza shop.  The pizza isn't overly greasy - just enough to give it a little flop on the ends.  The crust is actually better than average. The people are friendly.  The ambiance is sports-minded and quaint.  They also serve a lot of pizza at Centennial High School nearby (which would have been awesome compared to the old-school cafeteria food I had back in the day). They are what your neighborhood pizza place ought to be with great service and a decent price."}
{"text":"This is a really great spot. The owner is super cool and so everyone who works here. They have a great lunch special if you come in before 4pm. You can mix and match a few options.   The wings are incredibly good. The pizza is great too. It has the slightly sweet crystal and is very nice and flakey on the edges. Do yourself a favor and don't just get a pepperoni pizza or you will be missing what makes the pizza so good.   The only drawback would be the layout. The have 3 TV's but unless you are sitting right next to them they would be too small to watch anything but highlights. They need a tv upgrade.   They have a huge size pizza too if you need to feed a lot of peeps."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and wonderful feel. This was my first visit and I needed a Philly Cheesesteak for a friend in the rehab center down the street. He's from Philly. He said that it was good. My son and I grabbed two calzones that filled medium sized pizza boxes. Mine had ricotta cheese which was an absolutely pleasant surprise and now a requirement. Good ingredients, the atmosphere was homey and I'm positive that I was served by the owner. I'm in love."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! The food was delicious. A great family friendly atmosphere where you can still enjoy a beer with your meal. Not only was the food great but the service was some of the best I've experienced in a long time. As a visitor from Kansas City I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Peoria or the Phoenix area.   P.S. Go Royals!!!"}
{"text":"Being from the Philadelphia area, everything Ballpark offers (especially their Philly cheese steaks) goes over and above.   Every time I go I'm greeted with a smile. The folks at Ballpark get it, they want us to feel at home and do an excellent job at it. Family and friends is the true theme of this neighborhood spot!"}
{"text":"I wanted to find a place that was close that had good pizza and wings. I was underwhelmed with the decor and dirty windows besides all of that lets talk about the food. I ordered 10 wings hot and a 16\" Pepperoni pizza, the wings came out hot and were cooked properly very tasty not so much for the pizza it was hot  that was the only redeeming value it had. The cheese was greasy and the sauce was tasteless. I'm still looking"}
{"text":"Always a great meal when we stop by and never have had a bad meal yet. Wings are great and always goes great with many beer options available. Baseball theme all around and tvs available to catch any sport on air... slices are almost like nyc but definitely worth the visit"}
{"text":"my first and last time there today..i have to say the pizza and wings are very good.the reason for my dis-satisfaction is the place is very dirty..it was about 3:30 and there were only a couple of guest eating..i had to wipe off a table to have a place to sit..not just that but everywhere you looked it was not very clean..i was going to have some hot pepper on my pizza but all the shakers look pretty scary..i got iced tea and lucky for me i dont use sugar.the sugar shaker is about the nastiest i have ever seen..as i said i wont go back..to many other places to choose from.."}
{"text":"It's delicious pizza but pricey. Wings are off the hook. Take there flame challenge haha good luck"}
{"text":"Love this place, wings and pizza are always great  Staff always friendly  Owner that cares about service and quality"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Everyone on staff is support friendly and helpful and the owner makes you feel like family. The pizza is fantastic, subs and salads are great and the wings are the best in town!!"}
{"text":"The service was great. The owner came by and visited our table. We ran a tab without having to give a credit card. The food came out quickly and was very good. We had a great time and very family friendly."}
{"text":"This place is amazing first ordering from here and will keep on ordering, food got here on time still hot, the lady that delivered couldn't have been nicer and it tasted amazing can't wait to try more of their food"}
{"text":"Best pizza and wings in town. Absolutely love this place. The wings are not your tiny ordinary wings. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Excellent menu! All freshly made with a delightful taste. Folks are friendly and efficient when delivering orders."}
{"text":"I love Ballpark, the pizza is really good - the honey hot wings are ridiculously good. The best part about this place is not the pizza or the wings, but the customer service. The owner always treats his customers very well, I've been there 5 times now. This time I ordered takeout on a Sunday and even though he closed in 15 minutes (I didn't know) he still was extremely friendly and even offered me a complimentary soft drink while I waited."}
{"text":"Ball Park employees are always friendly and get orders ready in a timely manner.  The Philly Cheese Steak sandwiches are GREAT.  But if you get fries or onion rings, get them extra crispy."}
{"text":"I've been going to Ballpark for about 10 years now, the cheese pizza and honey hot wings are some of the best you'll have anywhere. The owners are also very friendly and nice and the place just has a neighborhood mom & pop shop feel to it. Great place, great food, I'm just sorry it took me this long to review it."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is just what you want out of your local pizza shop. The owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous.  I work at a local elementary school and they are great helping us out with fundraisers and the like. They also give teacher discounts!  Their lunch specials are great and there really isn't a whole lot of waiting when you order your food. Their pizza is delicious and their salads are fresh.  Please drop by and give them your business!"}
{"text":"Fun friendly Atmosphere. Sonoran chicken sub is amazing, salads are good. Pizza is ok.  Great people!! And I love local family owned places!! Will be back often"}
{"text":"These guys are great!  Being from back east I am a pizza snob and this is a good pie!  When we moved from central Phoenix out here we found ballpark thru Google and have been a regular ever since, wish they had a punch card lol.  The staff is over the top friendly and always making sure the guests are happy, if you decide to eat it, I take out.  The seating is set up like being at a little park and dug out...pretty cool.  They have beer on tap and bottles as well as soda.  For you beer snobs that have to have tap, this place is limited but they do have Sam Adams!  It's always a happy dinner night when I say I am picking ballpark...keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! How did I not know about this place. We ordered sliders with fries, a steak & cheese sub with fries, a slice of pizza (which was huge) and an appetizer combo, which included mozzarella sticks, zucchini and onion rings. All that for $36 delivered (not including tip). The food arrived hot and within the time quoted. The delivery driver was very polite and carried the food in for me. There was nothing fancy about the packaging, but the styrofoam containers were lined so that the bread did not get soggy. That's good enough. The food itself, considering what it is - pub/ bar food - was very good. The cheesesteak wasn't Philly-style, but it was a fabulous sandwich nonetheless. Everybody enjoyed their meal. Will definitely order again."}
{"text":"Ok pizza...too soft and not enough sauce. Two things of which I can probably ask them to tweak for me but based on their way of making pizza is just not for me."}
{"text":"One of the best Philly Cheesteaks I have had!  Great little restaurant where the owners are super friendly, the staff I pleasant and helpful, and the food matches the quality you would expect.  We stopped in on a Sunday evening, not wanting to have to wait to eat. They were happy to help and offered some sugestions as we were just kinda \"blah\" about eating.  We ordered the sampler appetizers, a small cheese pizza for the kids, some bone in and boneless wings, the philly Cheesteaks and a ham and provolone sub.   We took a menu and a magnet on the way out and will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"I seriously can't find a better pizza joint around town, and they have the BEST chicken Cesar salad I've ever had in my opinion. Always delicious and never disappoints. We order from them when we have family parties or get together and everyone asks where we got the pizza from.  The guy who runs the place Randy is always very nice as well, he adds the family touch to this place. Our family would hands down pick Ballpark for dinner any night of the week!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years! My first experience coming here  was after just after this landscaper ripped me off for services I paid for. When I came in the front door the owner must have seen that I wasn't happy. He immediately handed me an ice cold beer and said this one is on the house. I talked with him for a while and departed with my pizza. I assured him that I would be a loyal customer because it was obvious that he cared about his customers. The pizza and wings are awesome. We enjoy the cheesy bread as well. The pizza is cooked properly with plenty of toppings. They always seem to have plenty of customers in the restaurant. So that's another indication that the food and service is good.  Go in and check them out and tell them Billy the Kid sent you."}
{"text":"We love trying mom and pop places near our house. We actually had pizza last night and tried the chicken slider basket and the chicken tender basket. They were both very good. The funny thing is that we were accidentally given a slice of pizza. I thought maybe my fiancé ordered it and he thought I had ordered it, but it was supposed to go to another table which was made correct. Anyway, it may have been the best pizza we have tasted in Phoenix. New York style pizza just cheese but needed nothing else. I think the universe wanted us to have this heavenly delight. In conclusion, we did not come for the pizza but will be back for the pizza."}
{"text":"Ridiculously good gold wings! I mean, simply wow. The pizza is great, and the zeppolis (no idea how to spell it--addicting fried balls of dough dusted in powdered sugar that you dip in chocolate or raspberry sauce) are delicious, but I could and have often gone there only to eat full meals of wings. Absolutely perfect."}
{"text":"Everything here is good! My husband and I meet here at least twice a week for lunch! The service great! The atmosphere is fun! Favorites to order: gigantic pizza slices and buffalo sliders! The pizza crust is amazing!"}
{"text":"this place is pretty cool. the staff seemed to know a lot of the customers and what they wanted to order.. the wings are good.... pizza is ok.... I think I'll wack back a few pitchers of beer and some wings next time and see how that goes!."}
{"text":"Amazing food ! Great service! Friendly people! Feels like home coming here! If you want pizza from the east coast this is where you have to eat!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots! Food is delicious, prices are very practical and service is awesome every time!!"}
{"text":"Had a sub here, was really excited from the great reviews. It was terrible honestly, not worth the money at all, the sub bread is about 1 inch across and the toppings weren't very good at all. Didn't enjoy it."}
{"text":"This place was great!  The customer service was outstanding.  We ordered a pepperoni pizza that was very cheesy and delicious. Also had a a salad that was put together well.  In addition we had buffalo wings in their mild sauce. The wings were the best part. Crispy but not over cooked and the sauce had good flavor.   The decor was simple but different. They have a chain link fence to separate a section that give the appearance of a dugout.  There was a kids baseball in the area which was perfect for that type of space.   The only downside is it was a bit pricey for pizza and wings. But anywhere these days is pricey."}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly, good environment, the pizza is HUGE!!!!!!!!!  One slice could easily feed 2 people. The only problem I had with this place is the most important thing about a pizza place..... The pizza was HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!  It taste so gross it's way too thin, no sauce at all!!!!! All you taste is burnt dough and cheese. Worst pizza I've ever had, hands down."}
{"text":"Okay.. I saw the reviews but I still must admit that I was skeptical but decided I was going to try them out. My goal for today? To taste their Philly Cheese.. stopped by, ordered to go, and on my way back home I started getting hungry from the yummy smell. Now mind you, I didn't even see it yet. Got it home, snapped two photos, and jumped right in.  Verdict? Mmmmmm! Mmmm!! That was one yummy cheese steak!! Fresh bread, nice cuts of meat, good cheese, and the fries perfectly complimented sandwich! I really enjoyed it and I WILL be back!   Now, I want to try the pizza and other menu items. I loved that the place was clean, well kept, and with friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Great food selection. We ordered wings, pizza, and appetizers and all were excellent. Take out service was very quick and there were no mistakes on our order. Wish they delivered to our area though."}
{"text":"Love the pizza... the staff is friendly and helpful and the price is great! Restaurant is good for big parties...lots of kids and sports fans...  it's order at the counter and not so relaxing.. but if u r just looking for a great pie...thus is it! We enjoy take out a lot from here too! Try it... good people!"}
{"text":"Variety of food. Pizza was ok and fair prices. This place just doesn't have anything special that draws me back."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Local and not a chain so love supporting them. Gold wings are awesome and meatball subs are yummy too. They also deliver if you live close enough. :)"}
{"text":"So if your looking for the deal of a life time . Two big no scratch that two crazy extra large slices of cheese pizza and a drink 5$. Awesome pizza not too greasy. Came out super hot.  The two slices would amount to half a large pizza in some places. Can't wait to come back want to try the wings. The decor is cool kind of a small baseball themed bar. Sells draft beer. Would be a cool place to take a team after a game."}
{"text":"Was visiting from out of town and found this place. Great staff, very friendly. Pizza and wings were very good. Prices were reasonable. If you are an near there I recommend this place"}
{"text":"I will never understand the overabundance of \"mom and pop\" pizza shops in Peoria.   It almost seems like a practical joke.  Dozens of \"local\" pizza shops, all with different names and menu layouts, all living on the same street, peddling the same food made with the same ingredients to the same curious customers, who keep shifting from one pizzeria to the next hoping to find something \"different\" before they ultimately settle on whichever one is more atmospherically pleasing to them.   This is not to say Ballpark Pizza isn't worth a try.   In fact, of all the copycat pizza parlors in the city, it's one of the better ones.  While their pizza isn't worth writing home about, it's pretty low on the grease factor and tastes quite nice when dipped in ranch. It's pretty inexpensive, too. A large with two sodas and some wings shouldn't run you more than 20-25.   The wings are what Ballpark's known for. They make a certain sauce that is so intensely hot that they have a wall of fame for anyone who can eat half a dozen of them within a certain time limit. One of my friends has his picture posted on the wall. I keep asking them for a \"Hall of Famer\" discount whenever we show up. We never get it.  Oh, and the rules stipulate that while consuming the wings, you may drink whatever you think will help stave off the burn. I've seen guys pounding shots of ranch to keep the burn at bay.   Just a sense of what to expect at Ballpark.  It's sports-themed, but to the extent of other \"sports restaurants\" that blast six or seven TVs all playing different games or whatever the hell ESPN has on. The TVs just loud enough so that you can watch it and carry on a conversation. I was at Ballpark when Michael Vick was first investigated for that whole dogfighting thing. Then, a couple of months later, I was at Pullano's, which is literally down the street, when he gave his public apology.  I need to find something new to eat.  Personally I prefer Ballpark as a lunch spot. It's fairly uncrowded, even during the lunch rush. The food comes to  you fairly quickly, and the staff are always walking about the dining room looking to hook you up with extra napkins or whatever else you may need.  It's the little things that make a pizza shop."}
{"text":"Sometimes I need to manage my expectations with yelp.  Lots of excellent reviews but imho this place is just ok.  The pizza is peter piper esque. And the boneless wings are chicken strips cut in half. The golden sauce did taste good.  But after going outside the box it's back to Barros for us. 32 bucks for 20 wings and a large medocre pizza... And you don't even get 50 tokens."}
{"text":"Love Love Love this place! When I want delicious and scrumptious pizza and wings...this is the only place!!! The best Pizza around!!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place and I am glad we did. I got two pizzas to go and they were ready quickly. The pizzas are huge! The large is really an XL! Pizza was great. I plan on trying the wings next time"}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by for a quick \"Oh my good, need food now\" lunch. We were driving along and found this place by pure happen stance.   Boy oh boy were we pleasently surprised. Based on the reviews, our expectations were set higher than usual and man, did this place live up to them. From the moment we walked in, we were greated by a very warm and gracious young lady. After realizing that we were still eligible for their lunch special (they go until 4:00pm) I ordered the \"Choose 3\" while my wife picked a the Philly on a wheat sub roll with peppers and onions. My choices included a LARGE slice of cheese pizza, a huge garden salad and 5 impressively sized wings (medium and bone in).   Everything was delicious. The steak for my wife was thin and flavorful. The wings, crispy and juicy. I have to say, the crust and sauce they use is grade a. All in all, we'll be back. So good."}
{"text":"Great place to eat, and any joint that supports local sports is good place in my book.  Only been there for lunch, but have been many times.  Pizza is decent but nothing out of the ordinary flavor-wise, but the lunch slices are huge!  Sandwiches are good, but the Buffalo sliders are great!  Staff is genuinely concerned that your experience was good, and they are always friendly.  Highly recommend this place if you are out west and hungry!!"}
{"text":"It's a pretty good basic neighborhood pizza joint.  My wife liked the pizza, and I had wings and a salad.  Unfortunately their hottest wings are \"novelty wings\" that aren't meant to be eaten.  It was just their hot sauce with pure capsaicin added.  Just heat with no flavor, pointless.  I love really hot wings for the flavors of the hottest peppers."}
{"text":"Awesome place very kid friendly. Pizza dough is great and well done not doughy and wings were crispy & delicious! Loved the antipasto salad... $ very reasonable! Def go back!"}
{"text":"Pizza, wing, & drink combo is such a great deal. Pizza slices are huge which is awesome. The flavor is great, but I wish they had Canadian Bacon :( plus, the pizza is a little greasy. The wings are so spicy, but if you don't mind then they're great! They're crispy & the wing sauce is so good. The customer service is always great too. Love supporting family businesses."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great food and a fun atmosphere,  this is the place.   I have been coming here with my family and friends for years.  I am never disappointed with the food, it's always delicious.   The staff is very friendly and they always try there best to make it a great dining experience.   My personal favorite are their wings, but they have a full menu of pizzas, subs, salads and more..."}
{"text":"Stopped in with some family not expecting to eat, as soon as their food came I had to try a slice!! I ordered by the slice pizza and it was way larger than expected.  They added an extra layer of cheese to the top to make sure my toppings didn't slide off the pizza.  It was delicious! The pizza had a perfectly crispy crust.  The wings were excellent, crispy and not saugy or of sauced.  We also ordered the pizzokie and that was delicious as well.  Great prices, excellent food.  We will be back next Saturday."}
{"text":"AWESOME AWESOME food! The staff was very friendly and it created an amazing atmosphere! If I lived here in AZ, this place would definitely be my favorite! The owner even brought out a couple slices of pizza for us to munch in while we waited. Did I mention that this place has awesome food!?"}
{"text":"Overall pretty good.  Pizza is not over the top amazing, but good.  I like the Sonoran Chicken with the peperoncini sauce...mmmm.   A little spicy, which I like, but not mouth burning.  Also, the wings are good.  I have had both the honey bbq and the hot wings, both are exceptional."}
{"text":"The BEST Pizza and Wings that taste the closest to NY pizza & wings....Great employees/owners.....will make this a stop every time I come to Phoenix.....thanks for my glasses.....every time I use 'em, I will remember the Ballpark Pizza & Subs......"}
{"text":"The wings (according to my husband are excellent).  Pizza was just ok. Extremely greasy.   Skip the garlic cheese bread. It was not worth the price."}
{"text":"This place does not disappoint.  Their antipasto salad was huge and great and I ordered the small.  Their calzone was ridiculously amazing... And huge!! The beer is super cheap.  The wings had a lot of selection and were legit.  But the service was why I gave it 5 stars.  Wonderful people."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a while and they're awesome! Super friendly and accommodating, always fast (even with pick-up orders), and the food is great! Love that the pizza isn't drenched in sauce. Great place to bring the whole family or other large groups! The salads here aren't my favorite but that's what I get for ordering a salad at a pizza joint :) Awesome atmosphere and definitely our favorite local pizza spot!"}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing! You can just taste the brick fire oven. And the wings were just perfect. No more dominoes for me. I'd rather pay couple extra bucks for actual pizza and wings."}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere!Great pizza! Awesome Wings!  Great friendly service!!! Will definitely be  back!!"}
{"text":"Chicken options are the standout here....fresh,juicy,tender and flavorful. Pizza is good as well as the onion rings. In an area with many such places, Ballpark stands out for its friendly,courteous,prompt service. Owner remembers and greets all repeat customers. Definitely worth a try, won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best neighborhood pizza joint around. We love the friendly staff and owners. The food is really good, portions are large and prices right."}
{"text":"Ballpark Pizza and Subs has some has some really good pizza and sub sandwiches.  We went with a half cheese and half \"Grand Slam\" pizza (Pepperoni, Sausage, Black Olives, Green Pepper, Mushrooms and Onions). This pizza was definitely a HOME RUN (eh? eh?). Seriously though, this pizza was HUGE for a large (18\" diameter) and the ingredients tasted fresh.  We also ordered the \"Ballpark Philly Cheesesteak\" sub (Ribeye steak, Peppers, Onions, and Cheese), which was also very tasty.  The only things I didn't like here were the items that came in the \"Combo Basket\" (Mozzarella Sticks, Breaded Zucchini, and Onion Rings).  Each of the items is dipped in the same batter and are fried to the point where you can't tell which item you're eating.  The flavor profile is the same for each item - a deep fried batter...that's it.  But hey, this place is called Ballpark PIZZA and SUBS, and they do both those things EXTREMELY well, so I can't knock 'em too much for the appetizers."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and every time I have picked up, everyone including the owner has been super nice and friendly. When they deliver, the delivery person has been nice and not creepy.   I am a total pizza snob, and while this place doesn't have the best pizza, they do have decent pizza. I don't mind eating it. What i do love here is their freakin' wings!! Their mild extra saucy well-done wings are crispy and flavorful. My mouth is watering as I write this. They hands down have the best wings I have tried from anywhere else and I happen to be a wing junkie as well.  If you are on the west side, I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The \"honey-hot\" wings are so delicious, but watch out for those \"flame\" wings! Price is very practical, and the lunch special is great, 2 slices of pizza and a pop for under $5."}
{"text":"Great service, super friendly staff. If you want casual laid back pizza joint this is it! Pizza was excellent. Wings are excellent."}
{"text":"Visiting from SD for my son's baseball tournament and needed a quick bite before the next game. My son did a eeny, meeny, miny, mo deal and chose Ballpark.  THE BEST pizza and wings!! It was SOOO good!! And the service was outstanding!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this pizza joint! Service and staff is excellent! They are always extremely nice and welcoming! They have the BEST philly cheesesteak sandwich ever!!! I crave the Gold wings all the time! Pizza is awesome too!! This is a must!"}
{"text":"Ordered from here last night: Medium Sausage, Mushroom & Artichoke. 10 Wings. $32 That puts it in the high end pizza arena... Normally, we order thin crust pizza and Xtra Crispy wings...I decided to just place a basic order no special instructions just to see what the \"standard fare\" was.   The wings are very meaty. At a buck apiece, that's a good thing! (I remember when wings were 10cents...I long for those days.)  The pizza was good...maybe a bit scant on the toppings but good. Nice crust. We'd do it again when in the mood for delivery but if we are gonna go out for 'za I'd hit up Sardella's since I'm a fan of theirs and there is one in our new area - just outside of the delivery zone for them.  Bottom line is Ballpark is playing in the big leagues with these prices and while it may not be a grand slam it's at least a 2 run double."}
{"text":"Good pizza family owned and they support the community!!! Honey hot wings are the best!"}
{"text":"These meatball subs and the gold wings are fantastic. I'm so happy this place is here. My wife always gets one of the salads and they always use fresh ingredients. The service is super personable and seem to get along with everyone. I very much would highly recommend. Oh and they deliver. BAM i'm sold"}
{"text":"Great food for sure, but their customer service WOW!!!!!! We love their boneless wings because they are perfect little bites of chicken from heaven, and their cheese pizza is my dream come true.   Most recently we added a sub to our order and at pickup it somehow got missed. Any old regular pizza place would have given us the standard \"sorry here is a credit\". Not here... They had Jaime jump in a car and drive it right to us before we could even finish the phone call. We're not exactly close either!  When you find a place with great food and service like that, you don't go anywhere else. These guys got it right! Thanks Ballpark Team!!!"}
{"text":"Car broke down so I stopped in for a slice while I was waiting. Great pizza, great wings, and good service. Will definitely come back next time I'm here on vacation!"}
{"text":"I have been here before and found the food good, not great. Today I ordered buffalo sliders to go, and when I got home eded up tossing most of the meal. The sauce was very spicy, and they never asked which kind. I assumed they went mild since it was a sandwich. I'm glad I had buns around the house. The ones they gave me were a soggy mess, and the buffalo chicken fell right through it. In truth, the meal is huge for one person, though that's a bonus! The fries were fresh, but last time I came they were just fries, this time they put cheese and herb salt on them. Some may like that, I don't though and would have asked for plain if that is their normal."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a new Pizza and Wing joint for some time now.  There are a number of places I can go for good Pizza or good Wings, but this is the first time in a very long time I've found somewhere where the Pizza and Wings where both excellent.  The Pizza was has a great crust, cheese and sauce ratio.  The blend of cheese are tasty and creamy but do not overwhelm the pizza.  The Wings where also great, not fatty or over cooked and not covered in too much sauce.  They had the perfect balance of spice and juiciness.  Overall, it was a great experience.  Even though it's 15 minutes from my house, i will be back again."}
{"text":"I've been ordering food for delivery from this place since I moved into this house about four years ago and I plan on continuing to do so as long as they stay just the way they are! Love their pizza! Especially their white pizza! You have to try that one if you are a fan of ricotta cheese, chicken, and of course BACON! I absolutely love it! They have never got anything wrong with my order so I don't know how they would react if I ever let them know they did. I've even dined in at the restaurant a few times and they have always treated me great there! I definitely recommend this place for a place to go if you are looking for a smaller more family feel dine in, take out, or like I mostly do, delivery!  \"White Pizza\"!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and personal attention. Great casual family environment. Food is great! Great value. We will be back. We love supporting local family owned businesses."}
{"text":"This place rules.  Great wings. Sandwhiches and pizza.  Very affordable..ice cold beer and Randy is the man! Asl for him!!"}
{"text":"So I am literally sitting here as I write this review, the place is different, it's pretty standard as far as pricing goes. They have daily specials which are pretty good. The wife and I were having our typical argument about what to eat, as we drove by this place it caught my eye. So I suggested we try this place out. Of course my wife hops on her magical rectangle (iPhone for those who don't understand sarcasm) and looked up reviews and it had 4.5 stars. And she looked over the menu and she said \"that's fine\" now many married men would think this is a trap. I'm one of the few that takes advantage of that phrase. So we arrive and the decor is different, they have a baseball theme which is great. We approached the counter to order and of course my 4 year old now suddenly doesn't want pizza, and wants a hotdog. Wel son your in luck they serve hotdogs too.   We place our order and sit down. The wife got a lice with wings on the special, I had thought it was a bit pricey until the slice arrived. The Slice was pretty big and the wings were not your tiny wings you find at \"wing\" places. So worth the price. Cooked perfectly. I ordered a boring order 2 slices of pizza. I mean how bad can it be it's pizza. So when they arrived and were as large as they were I was shocked. Not only were they worth the price they were very tasty as well.   I can only assume the man who checked on us was the owner, he was incredibly nice. I am telling you this place is worth the visit. The wings were amazing. I will definitely be making this a regular place on my rotation of restaurants"}
{"text":"Barro's is normally my go-to for the daily lunch specials when I'm feeling like pizza. Not after coming to Ballpark, slices twice the size and taste. The owner was a really nice guy, even makes rounds around the restaurant making sure his customers are all satisfied."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and quaint child-like sports atmosphere, with a lot of families inside.  Seating is somewhat limited because several of the tables are very large and people don't seem to want to sit near other people.  I liked the pizza crust and sauce.  Crust had a nice light crisp on the very bottom but was moist and chewy in between, and the same at the ends.  Sauce is notably tangy, reminding me of many places in the Chicago area with very tangy sweet sauce.  Cheese though... it was somewhat gummy and stuck together too much (take one bite, and you risk losing half the cheese off the entire slice in one adhesive layer).  Perhaps it was overcooked a little and it crisps up too much.  Very moist with grease on top.  I'll give them another shot or two and see how different toppings go."}
{"text":"We order for delivery at least twice a month.  These are the friendliest folks I have ever dealt with.  The food is fantastic, especially the pizza and wings, but the subs are way up there also. I have never had a problem with the wrong food being delivered or cold.  Someday I am actually going to their restaurant."}
{"text":"How cute is their bullpen eating area? Lol. I loved the decorations. If you are a baseball fan you will love this place. I had the SW chicken sandwich and it was delicious! I will go back to try the pizza which seems to get mixed reviews. I really loved the service here."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been here for quite a while. I live 1 1/2 mile away but had never eaten here.  Walk in, walk up to the order counter, order, find a table.  Not a large place and most of the people seemed to be regulars. I know I will be back. Simple setup. I believe 3 TVs with sport. So if you want a pizza and watch the game, this would be a good choice.  There is 8 or so pizza places in the area. I have eaten at most over the years. This place had more people eating there than I believe any others.  We got their hot wings and a fully loaded 14 inch pizza thin crust. Loved the crust and there was plenty of toppings. The hot wings were hot and I found then to be just right for my liking. Drinks are self serve, so no waiting for someone to come buy to refill. The people were nice, helpful and attentive. Eat local. Give them a try."}
{"text":"I was pretty surprised at how much I liked this place. I have lived in the neighborhood for 5 years or so and never tried them. I am not sure what deterred me other than maybe the name. Ballpark just doesn't instantly trigger thoughts of great pizza for me... I will readily admit I was wrong though!  We ordered a pepperoni pizza and 20 wings. The wings were big and meaty and I thought they had a great flavor. The ranch wasn't my favorite ever, I am guessing it may have not been made in house, but I could be wrong. Ranch aside though these were some damn fine wings IMHO. The pizza came out a few minutes after the wings and I was blown away at how good it was. The crust was thin and crispy, which I absolutely love. My only complaint is that I burnt my mouth because I was not patient enough to wait for it to cool! I know, I know - that isn't Ballpark's fault so I won't dock them any stars. This place is a solid choice for some pizza and wings! I will try them again soon!"}
