{"text":"I dined at Ariel on December 17, 2011 for dinner with a group of friends. Though I certainly wish we had gone anywhere else. The owner seems to consider his wine list large, but whenever we selected a wine he would come back a few minutes later and tell us he didn't have that one. He would then present two alternative wines, which were more expensive. After I declined this upselling tactic, I was told the wine I chose (which has been featured in Food & Wine magazine) was not a very good one anyway. That is lacked body, and had no tannin structure. Continuing with that theme, we were told that some items on the menu (of which there are few) were not available that evening. After much haggling to order something on their various menus that they could actually provide, the food was underwhelming for the most part. I am happy to report that one person enjoyed their meal, as the lamb dish was expertly prepared. I had the duck, which was barely room temperature when it arrived on my plate, with sides that were bland. My husband ordered the Schnitzel, and while there was a lot of it on the plate, it lacked all flavor. I was beginning to wonder if they had run out of salt entirely. If you only have one evening to dine in Montreal, for the love of god stay away from here."}
{"text":"This small restaurant/wine bar is cozy and modern, and my husband and I enjoyed a wonderful meal with some very nice wine. A lengthy wine menu and a much briefer food menu are given on clipboards. Very interesting choices on both.

You'll find several types of bread in the basket, all of which we enjoyed. We tried a couple of different salads (one with an amazing type of heirloom tomato), followed by gnocchi (smoky, with proscuitto) and the risotto of the day (duck, that day). We both agreed that the gnocchi was the best either of us had ever tried, and the risotto was in the top 5.

The food is not inexpensive, but it was of such quality and we had such good service, I think it was worth every penny! (Or nickel, now that we aren't using pennies?) Next time, I would like to try the cheese plate, and dessert!"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered including various small appetizers, salad, soup, and dessert were all absolutely delicious and our waiter was amazing! Would recommend this place and will return on our next visit"}
{"text":"Went here with my bf when we dared to venture out into the Canadien cold this winter.
The concierge at our hotel had this menu and since i eat scallops, i was drawn to their offer of scallops so decided to give this restaurant a try.

I was not disappointed.

We opened up a delicious bottle of Chardonnay and it was really good.  The server was polite and courteous and every dish was timed really well.

I enjoyed the atmosphere very much for it was quiet and romantic.  We got a booth seat so i can put my jacket next to me and i felt very comfortable.

The appetizer course was a butternut soup wihch was really good and i ordered my bf a salad which was amazing with its sherry-shallot vinaigrette.  The salad was simple with slivers of parmesan, light dressing and croutons-- just how i love my salads.  The soup was good too, not too sweet with croutons to spice up the taste as well.

I liked my scallops but they were served a bit cold...there were five scallops and i'm glad that not too little were given.  I think the boy enjoyed his sea bass too...

Dessert!!! My fave molten cake did not disappoint.  I loved it a lot and it even came with a hot chocolate which was really cool.
If i visit Montreal again, i think i would return for the salad and the hot chocolate. 

I would recommend having more vegetarian options though.
But overall, love the atmosphere, service, wine and dessert. :)"}
{"text":"This small restaurant is fantastic.  I had never really noticed it before just walking by, a co worker booked the reservations.  There were 8 of us seated at one of the back tables and it was a great meal.  Service was very good, attentive and recommended drinks and food for us.  The apetizers were all great, (I tried most of them), they have a good wine list, and the main courses all seemed to please my guests.

Ambiance is very nice....not cool as much as sophisticated.  I'll definitely be back.  I'd recommend reservations as it is a small place."}
{"text":"This restaurant had so much potential and I was quite excited to try it. My friends were in Montreal from out of town and wanted to try a French restaurant close to where they were staying. I made a reservation for 20:30 but apparently when my friends arrived, the door was locked and the manager told them that they thought the reservation was for 20:00. After that little mishap, we were seated and we were the only people in the entire restaurant. Sure, it was a Monday night, but this was a bit shocking to be completely alone. The decor is quite nice with a little enclosed patio area and a fountain.

We ordered a cheese plate to start which was quite expensive for what it was. We had bleu cheese, oka and another soft cheese. None of these were that impressive but since we were hungry, we finished the plate anyway. I had their special salad which was greens with strawberries. The salad was doused in dressing- so much that I could not taste anything else except the bitterness of the vinegar. For dinner, I had smoked gnocchi with proscuttio and sun dried tomatoes. This dish just fell flat- it was really bland and unimpressive. My friend ordered octopus salad and found that it was equally bland. 

We also ordered a bottle of wine and they didn't have the one we requested. They brought us another one which was extremely bitter and tasted quite cheap. The bill at the end was quite shocking given the quality of the food. It's safe to say that we won't be coming back here. Luckily, the night was redeemed with a trip to Ripples."}
{"text":"Decent music, swanky atmosphere, and great wine selection. The food is quite delicious, and their recommended signature dish is the fried Cornish hen (served with bell pepper ketchup), although their duck confit risotto was superb. The goat cheese cheesecake was also one of my favorites. The cheese platter was simply uneven, the selection of cheeses and pairings somewhat inadequate (our platter only had only soft cheeses (Brie), whereas firm cheeses were indicated to be on them as well) (not all nuts and fruits pair appropriately with the cheeses presented), AND the licorice sauce was completely inappropriate as a pairing! This same sauce goes well with the goat cheese cheesecake, but then again, they need some improvement there. Lastly, the service is uneven. They're already very relaxed, but they are considerably slower (and less attentive), and seem overwhelmed when at about 50% capacity, so best to come here right when they open or when they're not too busy. It's a bit pretentious, so dress accordingly; and their credit card systems seem to be experiencing issues (highly inconvenient)."}
