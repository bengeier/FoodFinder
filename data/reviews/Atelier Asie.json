Les baos sont frais et délicats, et les ramens savoureux."}
{"text":"this is a decent Asian fusion place. overall, it's pretty good for the price. they work very fast - it's in a mostly business/office area, so I saw plenty of office workers come in, wolf down meals, and roll out. 

the chicken ramen was alright. not bad, not outstanding, but good enough. I liked that they don't nickel and dime you with a zillion ramen add-on options; sometimes it's almost too overwhelming. the dumplings were good. yes, I'll eat hot ramen on hot days, you got a problem with that?"}
{"text":"Perfect place for a quick service meal. I had chicken ramen and sample their bibimbap. Good meal portions! Complimentary self-serve water and tea is a nice touch. Friendly staff! Unpretentious. Just what I like!"}
{"text":"The ramen and porn bao were so fresh and delicious. The restaurant is cute and quaint, and the  staff were kind and welcoming. They made excellent recommendations and the food was prepared quickly. A half size ramen, one bao and a drink came to about $15. I would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"The broth was amazing, we got the volcano. Which is said to be most spicy but it wasn't spicy at all, but we didn't mind cause we could have just added chilli if we wanted to but the broth was really good. :)"}
{"text":"Cute little express Asian joint for a good quick lunch, near Square Victoria. Really tasty Ramen, the broth was very good. You can get a large bowl but also just a half portion, which I had because I also had some dumplings. A small menu, but good choices of dumplings or soup and a few other items. Not fancy but seems really authentic."}
