{"text":"First time my husband and I came to Montreal and we chose to go for a more French brunch. Best place ever! Service was great, music was pleasant and the food was delicious. They have a variety of breakfast, brunch, lunch and desert servings that will make anyone pleased to be here.  Very family friendly, we saw a few kids that were enjoying the sweets.
Overall I give it five stars!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this a five star because I loveeeeeeee this place! Even if I went only once, I love the atmosphere, the decorations and the PASTERIES!! It was soooo good! I admit its a bit pricey but its sooo yummy! Worth it! I suggest the tiramisu in the little cup. Hope you enjoy it too!"}
{"text":"While visiting Montreal we took the big red bus tour with the specific point of getting off at Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal.  As we were approaching the Oratory, our tour guide suggested Duc de Lorraine and we are grateful she did.

It's simple and casual atmosphere, but the food is excellent.

The three of us enjoyed a croque monsieur, croque madam and a baguette saumon along with small salads.  Each was simple, but as classic and wonderful as anything we had while in Paris a couple years ago. 
They clearly take their time, know their ingredients and know how to prepare these dishes.
While there, we saw many locals from the neighborhood gathering, which was a good sign.

Following lunch we were talked into trying three of their pastries, and Opera, Chocolate Eclair and an Eclair Chantilly.

Along with a latte and cappucino.. they were delicious.

Duc de Lorraine will definitely be on our list to visit again when we're back in Montreal.  It's a ways out of the city, but worth the trek, to be sure."}
{"text":"Excellent chocloat croissant and iced latte. Great to stop by if visiting St. Joseph oratory"}
{"text":"Way too overhyped and expensive. Yeah it's been around for a long time but since they've opened there's been a lot of competition. The pastries aren't as good as some other places and are also more expensive, perfect example are their éclairs, they're around $5.50 and same size as every other place... so they taste better? No. Never bothered trying the other things they offer there since everything is so expensive compared to other bakery/pastry shops. Wouldn't be surprised if the other stuff was also mediocre. Moral of the story, don't believe the hype, there's better value pastry shops and bakeries in Montreal that also have better quality and tasting food. Wouldn't really recommend"}
{"text":"Toujours très bon, service exceptionnel, bon rapport qualité prix! Bon endroit pour un repas du dîner, pour planifier les desserts ou prendre un café avec un livre"}
{"text":"I consider myself quite a connoisseur of chocolate croissants, and Duc de Lorraine has the best ones I have ever had outside of Paris. The croissants contain a rich buttery and flaky dough wrapped around rich decadent chocolate. Every time I go to Montreal I go here for breakfast every morning. I like their pastries so much that when my aunt and uncle came down from Montreal to Boston for my graduation I had them bring me a box. Besides the wonderful croissants this place also makes wonderful baguettes. In my opinion this is the best bakery in Montreal."}
{"text":"The omelette with cheese and mushrooms was delicious. The fruit salad was slice fruits in a glass of orange pineapple juice and tasted only the juice and not the sliced fruit."}
{"text":"Duc de Lorraine is a very nice upscale French patisserie in Côte des Neiges. The buttery croissants and pastries were amazing. The place is very clean and service is prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"Wow! Just did a takeout, $17 sandwich and they made it on a stale baguette. Inside the stale baguette was the smallest portion imaginable. I've ordered this before so I know what it's supposed to be. It unfortunately has happened before and I will no longer try again. Stop pretending to be a classy establishment, you're not what you used to be."}
{"text":"I have been coming here over the years when I visit Montreal.  It has always been a favorite. 
Nice staff, always pleasant and smiling. The pastry is top self! There is nothing like coffee and a fresh warm pastry!  Today I had the Quiche Lorraine.  It was great. Great flavor, chucks of ham and bacon, nice cheddar browned just perfect on the top. Good crust! 
I will always keep coming back! 
I really like the warmer weather when you can sit outside on the patio!"}
{"text":"Probably my closest experience to French cuisine.  Stopped by here for breakfast because it was on the way to St. Joseph Oratory.

We were one of the early customers.  Love the ambience and the food was definitely tasty.  I ordered the Ham Omelette and my husband ordered the Vegetarian Omelette.

I also ordered a side of Mille Feuille Double Creme (was craving for some pastry) and it is definitely not as sweet as what I had here in the States.  The pastry was very delicately made."}
{"text":"Not the mecca for the sweet tooth it once was.

I first learned of Duc de Lorraine decades ago and it is not as big a deal as it once was. That is due not so much because it has deteriorated (it is aging well) but more due to the fact that many of the goodies it offers are now offered so many other places that the rarity factor is now gone. I can now purchase 20-30% of Duc's offerings at the supermarket or pharmacy."}
{"text":"Amazing ambiance. Great service. Delicious desserts. Good choice of location for chatting and chilling on a sunny weekend afternoon with friends, while munching on a piece of delicate cake or pastry."}
{"text":"Wonderful Mother's Day breakfast, staff was great. We sat in the warm sun, food was good."}
{"text":"Essentially french pastry, food is delicious, specially fond of their beef salami & croissants!!One of my favorite places in montreal."}
{"text":"Amazing staff and great selection of goods. Will return again ! Love the lemon tartlette and cheese croissants"}
{"text":"Il est vrai que lorsque je suis rentrée à l'intérieur, je me suis crue en France! La même atmosphère que les pâtisserie françaises. Des gâteaux, des pâtisseries, du fromage, des boissons chaudes... Mais ce n'est pas donné financièrement, soyons honnête! C'est pourquoi ce n'est pas une place classée dans mes favoris."}
{"text":"Duc de Lorraine has been in business for more than 50 years, and for good reasons. Having been in Paris, their pastries look and taste as if I was in a Parisian cafe. Absolutely delicious. Flaky, buttery, great quality and very reasonably priced as well. 
Along, with a kind and friendly staff, who is very knowledgeable
I highly recommend the dark hot chocolate, made with French chocolate and tastes absolutely amazing! Their sandwiches and salads, are also outstanding.
Perhaps you are wondering why a positive review and four stars? 
Simply and only because of the parking. Let me be upfront, parking is a nightmare! Most of the parking is only residential, or with a permit only! 
The VERY few spaces available, are only for 30 minutes. 
So what I strongly suggest is park at the St. Joseph Oratory parking lot($5) and walk 3-4 blocks to Duc de Lorraine."}
{"text":"We stumbled on this place while trying to figure out how to get to our destination and we are glad we did! So many delicious looking things! We just got dessert and an iced latte but all of it was good. Staff was very friendly and professional"}
{"text":"Stopped by here when looking for a quick breakfast place in between two events in the neighborhood two weeks ago and had high expectations for this place based on previous reviews.

Upon walking in, you are immediately transported to a little café in Paris. The servers are dressed to the nines, the little tables and chairs are typical of the ones you fine in various parts of France, and the general ambiance makes you completely forget that you are in Canada!

We sat down and we're very surprised at the prices for simple plates like omelettes or two eggs with a side of bacon. Every menu item was priced a little ridiculously for what it was but we were hoping that this meant they were outstanding.

It did not.

What we got was a a very bland omelette and two sunny side up eggs with three pieces of fruit each for over $35!!! Adding to the damage, there is a counter with lots of fresh baked pastries that we wanted to try (because we thought that maybe that's where the strength of the café came in) but we were shocked when we saw the insane prices. Mille feuilles, éclairs and all other small desserts were $7-8 each (keep in mind these are $3-5 everywhere else in the city) and croissants started at $5. Nonetheless, we ordered an amandine (almond croissant) for $6 crossing our fingers that it would be the best amandine we'd ever tried but sadly, the amandine was just as bland as everything else.

The prices here can be justified if the quality and taste of the food was outstanding, but that's not the case here! To be fair, the ambiance and service were great so it wasn't all bad but that's not enough to justify the prices at this place.

Won't be back! :("}
{"text":"We planned a surprise birthday party (a small one!) here at Duc de Lorraine. What I loved about this place is its super nice, friendly, polite and helpful staff. They are handsome too  
They have a fabulous terrace surrounded by trees and overlooking the Saint Joseph Cathedral.
There is a always French music playing in the background making it an even more romantic place.
I found the pastry their forté however they offer food too.
Would definitely visit again sometime soon!"}
{"text":"I was in the area visiting the oratory and decided to come here on a whim. This is probably  the snobbiest place I've been since that tourist trap in Paris. The servers weren't very friendly and obviously spoke to me in French despite my answering them in English. OK, whatever, I could deal with that if their food was worth it. But it's not! The 3 chocolate mousse cake I had was overly sweet with no depth, they should just call it the white chocolate mousse with weird gel and dry/stale biscuit base. Oh yeah and it had a hair on it. I didn't have anything else so maybe they had better offerings I didn't choose. The table next to mine got a pizza and it looked so sad. It's like a flatbread with no sauce and a random sprinkling of toppings. Definitely not the worst but I've had way better."}
{"text":"I was greeted by a man in a white ruffled shirt with black now tie. 
I asked for the takeaway pastries. I was mesmerized by the flaky pastries. Then the chocolate mousse tortes in the other pastry case 
Purchased a chocolate mousse torte and a strawberry cheese danish.
Very friendly young woman behind the counter help me select them.
Brought back to room to sample with a bottle of merlot. Voila! Magnificent!"}
{"text":"Nice seating place, with a view of the Oratory St-Joseph. Wasn't too fond of the actually coffee though. Didn't feel it was worth its price.

Edit: I am upgrading my rating by adding 1 more star for customer service. They had contacted me telling me they are always looking for ways to improve. I appreciate that!"}
{"text":"I bought some pastries there. The prices are RIDICULOUS. The only reason I went was because it is supposed to be one of the best in Montreal. I almost had a heart attack seeing the prices. You can find just as good for half the price at many places. Very over rated. The cashier kept trying to get me to buy more stuff. No thank you. Honestly nothing exceptional."}
{"text":"After reading reviews from fellow Yelpers, we decided to try this restaurant. It is is a restaurant / bakery in a delightful setting. The dining area with its large windows made if feel like an outdoor cafe but with the warmth of being inside. 

The food is pretty good and I had a nicely presented ham sandwich with salad. I also had French onion soup, which believe it or not was better than the ones I had in Paris. The service was cheerful and the waiters did not have the attitude of Parisian waiters.

The bakery section had all sorts of single serving pastries that were nicely decorated and rivals high end Japanese or Korean Bakeries in presentation.

I would love to come back to this restaurant, but unfortunately I live in California...."}
{"text":"Le restaurant est situé à deux minutes à pieds du métro côte des neiges! Cette place attire les regards et possède une magnifique terrasse très classe!
C'est assurément ce que pensera chacun en apercevant celle-ci! 
Nous étions 3 et nous avons été placés en plein soleil sur la terrasse arrière de l'établissement et lorsque nous avons demandé si il était possible d'avoir un peu d'ombre il nous a été répondu : oui à l'intérieur!
Nous avons attendu un temps infini pour obtenir un verre d'eau, alors que nous étions quasiment en train d'haleter....
La terrasse est immense et nous avions clairement l'impression d'être délaissés! 
La carte était assez décevante, des prix très élevés pour de simples plats de brasserie... et un choix assez restreint (menu de juillet 2017)!
J'ai également était très déçu de la qualité du service...des serveurs qui oublient de nous apporter de l'eau, des serveurs qui oublient notre commande, des plats qui nous sont apportés alors que nous n'avons jamais commandé cela!
Mais heureusement ce qui a un peu sauve mon expérience fut que les plats étaient bons! 
Dommage pour eux, fort de la teneur de notre repas, je n'ai pas pris de dessert malgré mon envie...et j'ai fais comprendre mon mécontentement sur le TIPS (ce qui n'est pas mon habitude!)
Pour un établissement qui se veut \"français\" et chic....ma déception fut immense! 
Je déconseille!"}
{"text":"This place is both expensive and good. Everything here is of high quality.. It's like stepping right into France on Cote des Neiges."}
{"text":"What a pity that this lovely cafe which was once a favorite haunt of mine for years and years has dissolved into highway robbery prices for what could only be described as meager servings.  With so many other lovely places closing (such as De Gascogne) it is abhorrent that Duc de Lorraine has the audacity to serve small portions and a lackluster menu. I have often ordered Croque Monsieur, so having ordered this - at $19.00 would have expected a generous sandwich served on a bed of lettuce at least.  Sadly, my croque monsieur looked like a geriatric disabled sandwich, dry bread, old ham.. I was in the company of family who all ordered dishes priced well above acceptable pricing and were equally disappointed.  Shame on you Duc - you are no more than Paysan de Lorraine.  No more visits for me!!!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to stop and have lunch either before or after visiting the Oratoire Saint-Joseph du Mont-Royal. We both had quiche and salad, which were tasty, and I had one of the yummy pastries. Our waiter was professional and cordial. We sat outside on the couches along the side street, which was very pleasant. The owner was extremely gracious and charming, and he treated us like old friends."}
{"text":"After a visit to Oratoire St-Joseph, our party wanted a place to relax and have a coffee. A nice lady on the street pointed us toward the French flag - and we invaded!

There were 7 of us (which included 2 children) - and we wanted a seat on the patio. And wow, did these folks accommodate. They moved around tables and chairs, and even made some poor guy reading a book switch seats so we could take over. I felt a bit guilty about this, but they seemed happy to make us feel welcome.

We had already taken a look at the sweets inside, so we pretty much knew what we wanted. The waiter came and sat down to take our order - someone asked for a menu - he said, \"I am the menu!\" Very sweet.

The macaroon I ordered was dry. Everyone else enjoyed their desserts. It cost more than our lunch. This is the only reason I don't give the place 5 stars. Otherwise, really enjoyed the place!"}
{"text":"Anyone who says this place has gone down hill, I'd like to know what hill they are referring to? This place is a topnotch spot to experience some of the freshest pastries, cheese, meats and pate second to Paris as one can find!..Seriously. While exploring Cote-des-Neige, my friends and I passed by this corner patisserie and was drawn in by the most incredible smells I've ever experienced. 

Words can not describe the assortment of edibles Duc De Lorraine had to offer, so I added a lot pictures - they are as good as they look! 

Staff here were incredibly friendly and hospitable. Realizing that this was out first time there, one of the staff members broke out multiple tasting of cheese and fresh bread for us to try on the house. The aged cheddar and Guinness cheese was my favorite and unlike anything I have encountered, oh soo good! 

Note: They have an extremely reasonable lunch special: $8C gets you a bowl of the soup du jour, 1/2 sandwich, and a drink of your choice. There is a small glass enclosed dining area in the back that has a nice view of the area. 

This is the perfect place to hit before heading up the hundred plus steps to L'Oratoire St. Joseph. I Will definitely be returning to Duc De Lorraine again on my annual pilgrimage to be with Saint Andre."}
{"text":"This is such a cute little place! My parents have been bringing home pastries and cakes for as long as I can remember. Recently, I've been meeting up with a friend of the family here to pick up some freelance work from her. I had the occasion to check out the menu and pick up a wonderful strawberry cake for my parent's anniversary. The staff there is always courteous and helpful, and not saying anything when I stand around with my friend chatting for a while. The cake I purchased was filled with fresh strawberries, cream, and had a pink marzipan topping - very European. We all enjoyed it and I would purchase another cake from them for my next special occasion. 
The only quibble....it's a little bit expensive, even for the high quality."}
{"text":"Nice and quaint. Pastries all look good and the ones I ate were good. Macarons are not good so don't waste your $ on them, although they look pretty. They have the wrong texture - too tough. That's why I took off a star."}
{"text":"Je ne connaissais pas du tout cet endroit jusqu'au 14 juillet 2015. En effet, jour de la fête nationale française, c'est au tour d'un événement Yelp que j'ai pu découvrir tout le charme du Duc de Lorraine.
Proposant des pâtisseries (pain au chocolat, croissant), desserts et même sandwichs, disons que c'est un mélange entre café/boulangerie aux saveurs françaises. Étant de Bordeaux et ayant visité plusieurs fois Paris auparavant, pas de doute, j'étais directement immergé en France.
L'endroit est bien agencé selon moi : vous avez une partie où vous pouvez commander votre mets, une autre où vous pouvez vous installer. Il y a même une terrasse à l'ombre, avec une vue (très appréciable) sur l'Oratoire Saint-Joseph.
Le service est remarquable : toujours à l'écoute, serviable et disponible, ils seront là à la moindre attention. À entendre leur accent, ils viennent bien de France :)

Bref, un lieu que je vous conseille encore une fois !"}
{"text":"From the second you walk in here you feel the warm atmosphereand history since it is the oldest french bakery in Montreal.Great restaurant to stop by before or after visiting the St Joseph Oratory since Duc de Lorraine is walking diatance from it.Very lovely waiters dressed in proper uniforms. Great selection of desserts and service is fast and friendly. Nice big terrace outdoors with the option of couches, bar stools or chairs. Great touch!! Their millefeuille is a must try . The meat and cheese plater has a nice selection and their thin crust pizza is delicious.Very warm and 
authentic being there!"}
{"text":"Pas grand chose à raconter ici, mais c'est que du bien. J'ai pris un allongé pour emporter avec un croissant. L'allongé était très décent, le croissant était excellent. 

Service A1, c'est la classe ici! J'ai eu envie d'y passer l'après-midi et de goûter toutes les pâtisseries. Il y en a tellement! :D 
Ce serait bien, installée dans la verrière avec vue sur l'Oratoire.

J'y retournerai avant d'aller me libérer de mes péchés, amen!"}
{"text":"Très bonne pâtisserie est très bon café, par contre le gâteau au fromage à la fraise se mange mal malheureusement. La galette de sucre à glacer fait très beau mais malheureusement le gâteau trop dur à découper avec la cuillère quand vous le manger. Je crois que l'idéal serait de mettre une confiture de vrai fraises avec un coulis de chocolat blanc et un coulis de chocolat suisse noir 72% Il faut une confiture avec une consistance ferme sans grumeaux"}
{"text":"Best and most varied pastries in Montreal:

We had a great lunch at the Duc de Lorraine- excellent quiche and  pastries that both looked and tasted exquisite.  The mille feuille were superb, and the noisette-filled eclairs.  All the pastries look very scrumptious.  The pastry resource was especially helpful in describing the pastries and recommending ones to suit my taste.  Very attractive restaurant/cafe.  Especially nice outside seating in summer."}
{"text":"Heavenly sweets of my childhood; precious and yummy, especially the macarons!! Very special place- biased cuz of my history with the place but LOVE it nevertheless!"}
{"text":"A nice, cozy place. Plenty of sweets and desserts. The waiters don't know much about their desserts. I asked for the best one and it wasn't. But the eclers are really delicious."}
{"text":"Came here with my fiance after having a hankering for some REAL French macarons. Back home we don't have many bakeries near us that sell French or Italian pastries. Even the ones that do we have to travel far to such as in Boston which is almost two hours away. So in light of that, my fiance ended up picking out eight macarons: two caramel, two chocolate, two vanilla, and two raspberry. Personally my favorites were the vanilla and raspberry which both had a great flavor/texture. I found that the caramel macarons wanted to literally melt on me so I had to eat them rather quickly. My fiance, instead of eating my treats, ended up getting an eclair for himself which he enjoyed. I personally didn't go inside the shop so I can't comment on the overall condition. What I can say is that my macarons were awesome and probably some of the best I've had! We will definitely be coming back here again when we visit Montreal in the future."}
{"text":"En fin d'après-midi mon papa et moi-même décidons de s'y rendre, oui, nous sommes de grands amateurs de pâtisseries! Une fois a l'intérieur, l'accueil est chaleureux, on est salué avec un beau grand sourire ! 
Ils ont assez bien de choix en petits gâteaux, nous avons testé l'Opéra et le Brésilien. Verdict ?! Un peu décevant, ça manque de saveurs et malgrés leurs belles apparences,  ça n'a pas ce bon petit goût du gâteau fait maison malheureusement ! Et en plus, c'est cher !

Les serveurs sont plutôt pas mal et charmants, pour ça j'y retourné sans hésitez ! :D  Ils sont habillés de façon élégante avec la petite chemise blanche et tablier noir ! C'est chic ! 
Par contre, j'ai été un peu surprise car une fois installés, le serveur vient prendre notre commande, mais il s'assit à notre table, j'ai presque cru qu'il allait prendre le café avec nous ! Il se présente et ensuite demande notre nom, etc...  Bien qu'il soit fort sympathique, je trouve que c'est beaucoup de chichi pour pas grand chose ! 

Il y a d'autres choses à tester mais pour l instant je ne suis pas plus convaincue que cela. 
Par contre, ils ont fait un petit geste commercial, c'était la fin de la journée et ils nous ont donné 2 bonnes baguettes ! (Si je pouvais, je leur mettrais un 3 et 1/2)"}
{"text":"Le Duc de Lorraine se dit un authentique café parisien. Selon ma copine, c'est proche. Ils on de la Galette des Rois, des macarons, des babas au Rom, que pour en mentionner quelques-uns. 

Le café est divisé en deux sections : la première, principalement une pâtisserie/boulangerie, la seconde un petit café, à peine une quinzaine de tables très collées. 

Question d'atmosphère, les serveurs ont l'habillement obligatoire: la chemise blanche et l'accent, les tables bien collées et c'est plein. La section café est couverte d'une verrière qui permet la vue de l'oratoire Saint-Joseph. En fait. on le voit de côté, un point de vue inhabituel et qui permet de bien voir ses dimensions. 

J'ai mangé un pain baguette calabraise, c'était définitivement la meilleure baguette calabraise que je n'ai jamais mangée. Mon capucino était aussi très acceptable. Le mille-feuille, par contre, un peu plus décevant. Il manquait de \" wow \", correct, mais rien de plus. 

Le plus décevant est le prix et le service. J'accorde que le café était bondé, cela laisse à désirer. Le service pourrait être plus efficace. Le prix, imposible de ne pas décrocher. Un sandwich à 14$ +tx, c'est un peu dur à avaler, même s'il est très bon.

En conclusion, si vous êtes à la recherche d'une grignotine et d'une ambiance qui vous rappelle vos souvenirs d'Europe. Ce café est pour vous, si la facture ne vous fait pas peur."}
{"text":"We hoped our friends would try this place while visiting Montreal.  We had the honor of meeting the owner on our first visit there, very engaging, very upbeat too!  The food was wonderful, the staff was helpful without being hovering. The outside seating view of St Joes up the hill was perfect.  Tv outside to watch the World cup action!"}
{"text":"Outstanding cappucino; one of the best tasted in North America, better than the US. 
Delicious amandines. 
Easy access by car either direction; parking is reasonable. 

A bit pricey. 

A must-see for a pastry shop in Montreal. It's as close to the Parisian experience as it gets."}
{"text":"On a sunny spring Sunday, my friends and I decided to go to Joseph's oratory to experience the beautiful view of Montreal. After this excursion we decided to go for an impromptu meal and found this unassuming spot on the corner of the street. 

Upon entering the restaurant, we were met by the exquisite smell of freshly baked goods, with a delectable array of homemade cakes, pastries and other sweet treats. The large bay window on the end wall of the restaurant allowed the natural light to permeate the room, exploiting the marvellous day.

The menu contained a myriad of French brunch options, such as croissants and baguettes. Three of us opted for the classic French baguette with ham and cheese. The Parisian-style baguette was the perfect texture, and the fillings did not disappoint. We then decided to order a sweet treat, I opted for the almond croissant which was a perfect finisher, and my friends who got the hot cross bun raved about it!

Along with that, the service was fantastic - they were very attentive and our glasses were always kept full. 

All in all, Duc de Lorraine was an authentic French experience that I would highly recommend. Will definitely go back to try more from the patisserie!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come to Montreal, I like to stop there as this place has a special meaning to me ; this is where my parents got their wedding cake made 30 years ago! 

The local is very lovely and French looking, all the products are nicely displayed and there is a very cute dinning room and a nice patio during the summer. 

They offer some delicious sandwiches and pastries and it does wonders for a nice and casual lunch. 

The food is so good that I would give it a 5 if it was not for the not so attentive service we received on our last visit. It's not the staff was impolite, but they just seemed not motivated to work."}
{"text":"The venue is warm and inviting with comfortable outdoor seating- seasonal flowers and attentive service. Speaking both French and English the word wine is universal and plentiful. The cheese, fruit and meat platters reminded me of a small cafe in southern France  dessert - ohhhhhh dessert! The chocolate mousse was my fave- it was rich and creamy.  The fruit tarts are definitely savory and must be tried as was the strudel. Such a wonderful place to meet with a friend to sip wine and nibble on dessert  can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"I went to this place for brunch after visiting the nearby St. Joseph's Oratory while on vacation in Montreal for July 4th. The place has both indoor and outdoor seating, which I found very nice. The waiter let us order a platter with meats and cheeses of our choice - delicious! The desserts were all very, very good too - personally, I'm an eclair person, and these were great here.
Our group of 5 liked it so much we came back for breakfast the next day. This time, we tried the quiches - the Quiche Lorraine (ham) was amazing.
Also outstanding coffee!"}
{"text":"I had two so much different experiences in a week time in Duc de Lorraine that I have the feeling I visited two different places. Well the location and personnel were the same. The host and waiting stuff are overall very accommodating, and the service is fine. What I had problems with is the croissant quality which was the main reason for my visit. 

Sunday #1. I have an important business in Côte des Neiges. It is a beautiful sunny fall day, somebody is craving croissant and Yelp told us Duc de Lorraine offers some of the best. It is indeed my first visit in this very popular French bakery. The place is packed with brunching customers, but we are seated shortly. The croissants and pain aux raisins are amazing. So good that we actually depart with two croissants for the next morning and even after almost 24 hours the croissants are as good. With the addition of two glasses of prosecco (yes, they have full bar) we definitely depart extremely happy.

Sunday #2. After a long and exhausting work week I'm craving the very same croissants. Why not have coffee and croissant at the same place? Duc de Lorraine is packed again. The wait is approximately 15 minutes, that allows me to look at the new batch of croissant that are just baked and arranged behind the counter glass. They somehow look strange, lack the usual brownish color. People who came after us are seated first, that little frustration is somehow resolved as at least we are getting the table we prefer. The croissants arrive and they are the worse I have ever had. May be that would be the way my first home made batch of croissants will be if I ever decide to make them myself, they lacked fluffiness and multiple layers, the bottom was under baked dough. I actually can get better croissants in Provigo. The cappuccino was only so so. We depart not so happy. 

I really like Duc de Lorraine, but they lack consistency and I have no interest to go back. You can't exist based on your previous fame, if you have produced crappy batch of croissants just don't offer them to your customers. I feel really bad writing a three star review, but this is the final math after summing up my experience from Sun #1 and #2."}
{"text":"I usually don't really care about the service as long as I get what I want but... I wouldn't say this was a good experience.

Went there with a friend, first the waiter just broke a glass right near my feet as we were sitting down, Bad luck, I can't blame him, shit happens.

We ordered, some really overpriced pastries and coffee. I asked for an iced coffee or something like that (thanks for the details Pierre) 
Order arrived, 15 minutes later or so, and the waiter just spilled half my drink while giving it to me. So he took it back, and came back another 20 minutes later, I had finished my pastry by then, my friend had finished everything, and he only managed to spill one quarter of the drink this time.


Great.

Pastries are ok though, and the rest of my drink was fine. But overpriced."}
{"text":"It's a beautiful little coffee shop with delicious looking pastries ( I only ordered coffee). It took a really long time for one of the beautiful servers to come and get my order. I ordered a decaf. It came without the cinnamon I asked for, and it tastes ridiculously like warm water. Too snobby for me and the coffee is terrible. I'm disappointed. I know the pastries and cakes are delicious tho. A shame about the coffee and ambiance."}
{"text":"We found this lovely cafe by luck on our last day in Montreal. We had just spent the morning at St Joseph's Oratory and wanted to pick up some quick snacks before we started our long drive home. We stopped by Duc de Lorraine with the intention of getting some pastries to go.

We were greeted right away by the attentive and friendly staff. The decor is quaint and inviting. The staff struck up a conversion and upon finding out we were leaving Montreal, convinced us to sit down for a 15-minute quick lunch.

The quiche and cappuccino were delicious by themselves but the waitstaff and atmosphere made it one of our favorite memories of Montreal.

We've been recommending this cafe to our my friends who plan to visit Montreal since and we can't wait to go back. If you get the chance, don't skip dining in."}
{"text":"Warm and friendly service with a great selection of baked goods and fancier desserts. I had the chocolate almond croissant, a macaron and a cafe mocha, while my husband had the thin pizza followed by a strawberry napoleon style dessert. We enjoyed our selections immensely!

To top that off, the service was genuine and friendly. They have an outdoor area where we were first seated. It started to rain and the wait staff effortlessly moved everyone indoors within a matter of seconds. We had such a memorable experience, we kept trying to fit it in to our schedule for a second visit, but unfortunately, didn't get a chance to return to it. Our only hope is to visit it first thing next time we are in Montreal."}
{"text":"Depuis des années, c'est mon \"havre de classe\" côté croissants et autres délices du genre. Non seulement le service est parfait mais les employés sont vraiment à la hauteur de l'authentique café parisien. La nourriture est divine. Le café est parfait. Après vous être sustenté de ces croissants au beurre qui goûte le bonheur ou de ces pâtisseries remplies de bonne crème, prenez un petit (ou très gros, je vous le conseille) de leurs pizzas. Tomate est ma préférée. Je pourrais discourir longtemps sur ce bel endroit. Allez-y. Vous n'en ressortirez que comblés. PS: les cellulaires doivent être éteints dans le salon de thé. Très, très, bonne idée."}
{"text":"Une super pâtisseri à allé un avant midi idéal après oratoire à 1min à pied.Le mille feuille est le meilleur que j'ai mangé à mtl.La terrasse est merveilleuse vu sur oratoire.Bref une pâtisserie class"}
{"text":"Pastry's are ok but when it comes to croissants it's disgusting , tasteless but most of all they are heavy , you bite the butter croissant it like you are biting a french baguette so thick inside of croissant is full of Dough same goes
For chocolate croissant too . I won't recommend this place ,you can find much better  pastry shops in montreal"}
{"text":"This is the closest thing to a real Parisien patisserie you're going to find on this side of the North Atlantic short of getting on a plane and flying over to experience the real thing.

The quality here is outstanding, like real patissieres, they do not skimp on the butter, the most essential of ingredients, so if you are on a diet, you're out of luck. That also explains why their prices are higher than their competitors. Easily the best croissants, pastries and sandwiches you'll taste on the island of Montreal. I find they have strange hours, and have a tendancy to close early so try to aim for the middle of the day.

While their pastries and baked goods are the real star items here, I also have to add that their homemade sorbets are nothing to sneeze at either."}
{"text":"Very charming place. They have several sections with sofas for their outdoor seating areas. Good pastries, and really good smoked salmon, and prosciutto sandwiches.  Service, however, is a bit slow, but once you place your order, the food delivery is very quick. While it's not inexpensive, it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Beautiful terasse and beautiful interior. We actually came here two days in a row because of the amazing location and breakfast. The first day was excellent, the waitress was nice and the food was amazing. The second day though, the waitress was not very nice and didn't even bring out our menu until 10 mins in. My local friend here told me it was an English/French thing. The food was still excellent second time around. My favourite here are the croissant sandwhiches. The croissants were both buttery and crispy. 

Overall:

Atmosphere: 3/5 would've been a 5 if the waitress was nice, this is offsetted with the amazing terasse 

Food: 4/5 great food and delicious pasteries 

Score: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"I grew up coming to this place ! Pastries are just as good as they were 35 years ago."}
{"text":"Gorgeous pastries and equally gorgeous wait staff. The menu for brunch is pretty standard. but the food is beautifully prepared. Definitely order some of their delicious bread. Outdoor seating on the square is lovely."}
{"text":"I took my families to this much praised cafe. Upon we went in, we saw trays of delicious pastries and yes, salads and sandwiches were tasty too. However, my mother- in-law found a hair in her salad. OMG, this was so embarrassed. When I pointed out this to our waitress, she said nothing. And she even had another waiter to come over. But still, nothing, not even a sorry. Did this kind of situation happen so often that they felt it nothing? In food business, food safety came first and then the taste, right?"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere , european style, brunch, coffee , desserts with a nice service, many tables. Its pricey now you know."}
{"text":"Friend of mine says they have the best latte and croissants in town.
Dropped by before leaving town and I have to say, the place - though it needs a little freshening up - was a nice break from the rush all over the place.
The prepared food was not all that remarkable, however, the coffee was great and the latte is superb. The service and care each of the staff takes for their customers is notable. 
A simple breakfast ended up being $45! My buddy picked up a dozen croissant -- meaning $60!!! Yikes!"}
{"text":"I came here to grab a warm to go coffee before visiting the St. Joseph Oratory on a very cold day. I was met by a beautiful pastry shop, with a great and wide selection of baked goods. I wouldn't recommend coming here to grab a quick and affordable coffee. I would come again to sit down and enjoy a pastry and conversation with friends."}
{"text":"Awful service.  They forget to serve our food and we wait for one hour (even though when we said there was a problem eith our food, we wait for half an hour to be served). 

When we were finally served, they forget a quarter of the order. Food was average and prices high. 

There arr a lot of good restaurants in Montreal. Do not waste your time here."}
