{"text":"Randomly stumbled into this place for a late friday night bite with a group of friends. The decor really is great and cozy and the staff was extremely sweet! They gave us a free soup and samples of traditional turkish desserts (the cinnamon flan/pudding is great). I had the chicken sandwich trio which tasted good. The portions were alright, a little small for the price but in all honestly it was enough for me to be filled, without being bloated. The service wasn't really fast, so maybe not the best option if you're in a hurry, but if you're there to enjoy a nice slow meal, I definitely recommand it."}
{"text":"Even though I saw the review rank is low in yelp, My husband and I wanted to give it a try We ordered Iskender Kebab, a big plate, and something looks like dough with sauce all of them came cold the beef in Iskender Kebab wasn't good we couldn't eat it even my little daughter. the sauce taste in the dough similar if you put tomato-paste directly on it (not tomato sauce)  Very disappointed and angry and hungry :( the total was: 22 something oh the last thing, while my husband was paying, I saw a girl inside the kitchen smelling food in plate.. I'm afraid if they take the rest food from customers' plates and put for others"}
{"text":"Tasteful decoration with tasty homemade stuffed egg plant. I really enjoyed eating this. Country style food."}
{"text":"I had an Iskender Kebab. Quite good, very close to the ones I have eaten in Turkey. Check my attached  picture. For dessert I had the Kunefe, yummy."}
{"text":"One extra star for the decor. Where do I start? While the lady in the front was friendly, and the decor wasn't so bad, this place lacked in all other aspects. It took 14 minutes for me to get the plate of doner, in an empty restaurant, during lunch hour...that's way too long. When ordering, I asked for a glass of water and the waitress reconfirmed with me when she brought my food, but it never came. The entire plate tasted VERY BLAND. Under spiced and under seasoned. The potatoes were undercooked while the meat was dry. I had to use the help of the sriracha sauce to chow some of it down. Conclusion: I regret coming here...really."}
{"text":"Owner is a classy guy very nice person he is doing his best to serve the customers in a very friendly manners he decorated the place pretty decent we really like It BUT the food? It's completely different story we ordered doner kebab it's was very very very bad no taste at all it was cut like thick  steak  pieces no marination and it felt like broiled meat Doner  should be paper thin ( Yaprak doner) . Lahmacun? It was frozen, we ordered BBQ kofte Omg it was spiced up low quality garlicky meat  it was so dry  all I can say is  that please bring someone from Turkey who know how to cook because what you guys are doing has nothing to do with Turkish food. I hate to see this cute restaurant closed one day , we really like to owner what a nice guy I think his name is KAMAL BEST OF LUCK"}
