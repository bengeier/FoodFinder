{"text":"Just found 3 hairs in my sandwich - not going back.  Oh yeah, and I had to wait for the lady to get off her cell phone to place my order.  The only reason I (use to) go to this place was for convenience - I don't have time to wait around and/or go back to dispute the hairs in my sandwich.  GROSS."}
{"text":"Critic's is a solid spot for a lunch sandwich.  The menu is pretty basic:  Pick what kind of sandwich you want, what kind of bread you want, and whatever toppings or condiments you would like to add.  A personal favorite is the fat-free chicken salad sandwich.  They also have larger specialty sandwiches if you are really hungry.  The soups are okay, and the Turkey Chili is pretty good.  The pasta and fruit cups are decent but maybe a bit expensive for what you're getting.  The daily hot food special is often hit-and-miss and seems to tend towards pretty heavy items for lunch, like serving that include mashed potatoes or casserole.  In the end, if you find yourself dining solely within 200 Public Square, Critic's is a definite step up in quality over it's in-building competitor, Dine-on-9."}
{"text":"Critics makes great sandwiches, and more importantly - is consistently great!  Warning - these aren't sandwiches for those looking for a snack.  These things leave you satisfied.  Do I want chips? Heck no, not with this monster sandwich.  It is a \"no sides needed\" lunch - for sure!     I have tried a few of their specialties, but always go back to the staple.  A sandwich overstuffed with turkey, swiss, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles (hehe) honey mustard and a little mayo on their hearty wheat bread.  I tend to hit them up when I've had a \"later than expected\" weeknight evening and it just hits the spot!"}
