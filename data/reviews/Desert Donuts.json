{"text":"Bacon donuts!  Need I say more.  Very cool concept.  You order the number of donuts you want and tell them what flavor icing and toppings you want.  All donuts are cooked to order.  Toppings range from sprinkles to pretzels to bacon to nuts and on and on.  Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to get a quick donut.  Ended up having to walk out after paying and waiting, but not getting my food.  Cook was taking time to make the donuts and not serving the customers already there. Looks like a good place, but not if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"Live in Prescott try to stop by when visiting phoenix not very often I might add! Got a dozen donuts 4 bacon blast 2 rainbow and 6 reg & choc mix! I have never been so disappointed drove to Phoenix after I picked up my donuts and on the drive me and my niece decided to eat a couple before taking her to the airport the donuts were undercooked center of the donut was literally runny tried a couple more they were the same way some would say leave it to chance but $16 I'm going to say chances of me coming back no way!"}
{"text":"The most amazing donuts in AZ! The texture of the actual donut is like a hybrid between a cake and raised donut which is incredible. You don't feel horrible after eating them and considering they are made fresh, you know they will never run out of your favorite flavor like so many other donut places do if you aren't there first thing in the morning.   My favorites are the black and white, strawberry lemonade, and cinnamon sugar with drizzled icing.   Customer service is so friendly here, they always make you feel welcome.   Will continue coming back for my donut fix."}
{"text":"Ok, this might sound totally ridiculous, but I stopped by this lovely establishment last weekend and had a hot donut with plain icing. I haven't stopped thinking about it since! I won't eat another donut from any other place. The staff is friendly yes, blah, blah, blah..lol, but these DONUTS!! OMG!!!! They are THEE most amazing things I've ever tasted in my LIFE! The hours are limited so I can't wait for tomorrow morning. That's the only time I get to get to them is on the weekends.   p.s. I'm an NPC national bikini competitor and I STILL can't stop eating these donuts... THAT is how good they are!"}
{"text":"Awesome donuts!! the special pumpkin donut during the fall season is my favorite Friendly small owned company, love it."}
{"text":"The best donuts ever!!!! Love this place and the customer service is awesome!! Caramel delight and Apple Pie donuts are my favorite!!"}
{"text":"Warm, fresh.... made to order! So many flavor combinations! We ordered a dozen and loved all the flavors!!!"}
{"text":"We love this local gem!  The doughnuts are warm, and taste incredible!  We love that each fresh doughnut is topped/glazed/customized right in front of us. Great great place!"}
{"text":"Great donuts and coffee!  Was so glad they were open today (Labor Day).  Great concept on getting custom donuts and tons of options to choose from.  I admit that I was hoping to get a few Boston Cream but they only make the custom cake donuts.  No biggie -- what they had were awesome.  The chocolate come were killer and so were the peanut butter cup."}
{"text":"Found this little gem when traveling to Sedona one morning. Delicious and warm customized donuts that melt in your mouth! The only downside was that I only ordered one donut and not a dozen of them! There were also several different types of great tasting coffee you can fill your cup up with. We received a lot of help from TJ. He was very patient, helpful, and welcoming. I wish more people who work in customer service could be as friendly as he was! Overall, I highly recommend this place for a daily treat or for any special occasion."}
{"text":"Wow! Just stopped in for donuts. They are hot, fresh and made to order. About 20 different icings with 10 different topping choices. They taste amazing!"}
{"text":"What an awesome concept. Hot fresh made donuts made to order. Our first time in and fell in love with the donuts. My only mistake is i didn't order the bacon covered doughnut so i guess ill have to go again. Darn."}
{"text":"Tried Desert Donuts after meeting the owners and thinking they were pretty awesome people. OMG. I'm hooked.  First, I love the concept. Gas station donuts ruined my desire for donuts probably about 20 years ago. These are different. They're hot, and they make them right in front of you so you can choose exactly what you want. I chose lemon icing with almonds (because fruit and nuts are healthy, right?). My sons got chocolate icing with bacon sprinkles (good bacon, too - not the yuck fatty stuff), and caramel with chocolate chips. Holy diet busters! They were incredible.  Service was friendly and efficient, and the place was sparkling clean, which is great considering it was a busy Saturday morning. If I would have been in the mood for coffee, they had locally brewed Kona coffee, which is awesome.   I love supporting local businesses any time I can, and this is one I would definitely endorse. My only problem is the added calories in my diet, but everyone needs an occasional splurge. This is the place to go."}
{"text":"We stumbled on the place while going to get coffee at McDonalds.  I alway like local places better than chains.  What a great surprise.   First of all, it was spotless.  These folks know how to keep a clean place.  We were greeted as if we were old friends.   Then we found out what this donut shop was all about.  They make your donut to order.  Wow.    Since we are \"old school\" when it comes to donuts we kept it very plain.  Just cinnamon and sugar.    They were the best coffee shop donuts ever.  Really.  Hot, fresh, and practically melted in your mouth.  I could have eaten more, but my wife only let me have two.   The staff was friendly and gave us some tips on where to go in the area.   Great coffee and great donuts.  Please bring your store to Mass.  We need some better donuts. We inflicted Dunkin Donuts on the world.  Our punishment is not having these guys near by."}
{"text":"Stopped here yesterday and what a nice surprise!! Wondered as we entered where the donuts were. As we found out each donut freshly made while you wait(and not very long). They topped the donut with any topping of your choice or can pick one that they recommend. We chose their OMG donut witch was great. Cake donut with cinnamon on bottom and bacon on top. It was surprisingly a nice combo and very reasonably priced. The owner and staff were very friendly and helpful. I would recommend this shop a must stop when in the area"}
{"text":"Heard about them via a friend and read the reviews and went by. Not sure why I waited so long to go here, the donut I purchased was HEAVEN! I ordered a Maple Super Bacon one. It was made fresh to order while I waited. WOW. Friendly people and OH SO GOOD! I don't usually go out of my way for a donut, but THIS IS WORTH IT! Highly recommend. Their selection is very good and the price is right!"}
{"text":"We were road-trippin to Sedona and decided to make a quick pit stop for the essentials (donuts, of course). Wow, the atmosphere was such a pleasant surprise. Chris kindly greeted us, gave us the lowdown about the freshly made donuts with unlimited toppings, and provided a top-notch donut experience. Warm chocolate fruity pebble/coconut donut= OUT OF THIS WORLD. We will be stopping here on the way back too."}
{"text":"Keep in mind, its the same donuts different toppings.  With that being said - I love that you can customize them!  We go camping at Lake Pleasant and run into town for donuts and this is our new 'go-to' place.  They are friendly and excited to share their creations. Donuts are fresh and delicious. Very sweet, very sugary (depending on toppings, mind you) but there is a wide variety to top your donuts with!"}
{"text":"Had my first Desert Donut this morning & can't wait to try it again! Will be bringing these to my work to share with my coworkers because they are so good I want everyone to try them!"}
{"text":"This wonderful family that owns this little slice of heaven Has The Sweetest staff!! Now the coffee is the best fresh coffee beans I have had!! I look forward to my latte every week and how they make it!!   Now the donuts!!! The apple pie donut is to die for! Not to mention all the special kinds that they offer. Eating them warm and so soft is that little slice of heaven we look forward to!!!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am not a big \"sweets\" person... But my husband, on the other hand, has a major sweet tooth! We stopped by on a whim and were a little disappointed at first... Since it wasn't what we were expecting. But... It ended up being the best donut I have ever had. Warm, sweet, delicious! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Desert Donuts is a fantastic place to get your Donuts.  I just made my first  order of a dozen.  The lemon donut was the standout among the dozen that I got.  Eat your heart out, Krispy Kreme!!!"}
{"text":"Consistently amazing service, and food! All donuts are made that day and freshly made to order! A must do for anyone who has a hankering for donuts and coffee."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing!!! Went for the first time this morning and was ecstatic to learn that they make your donuts fresh to order AND you get to choose your own frosting and toppings!! So much fun to do it this way and VERY delicious.  I had the peanut-butter and chocolate chip donut, perfect with the chocolate chips melting slightly onto the donut YUMM and the lemon-powered sugar donut. My boyfriend had a white sprinkle donut and the strawberry with chocolate chips. All were VERY TASTY and we will DEFINITELY be back for more!!"}
{"text":"I want to eat here every day! PLEASE! Amazing cake donuts made fresh for you. Even if you think you don't like cake donuts, please try these. They don't have that artificial greasy mouth residue thing happening like Dunkin.   We ate 6 donuts between 2 people. I had to try them all! My husband loved the maple bacon (big surprise, ha!) and I really enjoyed the chocolate glazed, s'mores and caramel coconut.   You've got to get this place out :) ALSO, only $1.25 for a fresh donut. Can't be beat."}
{"text":"I can honestly say that this family-run shop has been one of my finest customer-oriented experiences ever both for the quality of the products they sell but, even more so, for the wonderful, friendly service they have provided day in and day out.    I recently retired and decided to visit the North Phoenix area of Arizona for two months.  As a MA resident, I had become \"addicted\" to Dunkin' Donuts coffee back east, and was worried about what alternatives might exist in AZ if no Dunkin' shops were located nearby.  The very first full day of my stay, I decided to try Desert Donuts, and I'm very happy that I did.  Desert Donuts' coffee has become my new favorite (Kona Blend), and their fresh, warm donuts ... are to \"die\" for!  I have visited Desert Donuts nearly every day during my two-month stay and could not have been more satisfied with the quality of their menu and service.  The owners, Chris, Linda, Brent and Brandon, have been like a surrogate family, welcoming me each and every day and wishing me well as I leave (as they do for every customer).    I have also enjoyed watching young children come in with their parents to choose (or \"build\") their customized donuts.  If you live in the area or are visiting others who do, I highly recommend Desert Donuts without hesitation.  They are located near the intersection of I-17 and Carefree Highway."}
{"text":"Went and tried Desert Donuts this morning and my first impression was \"where are all the donuts?  Surprise! They are made fresh to order! YUM!   I ordered 2 dozen (for a work function, not all for me) and they where made fast and fresh!  Everyone at my work was fighting over the custom flavors and toppings. Did I mention they have BACON donuts? Service was super friendly  :)  I will definately be back!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed a Black and White, Almond Joy, Lemon Bar and Bacon Blast fresh made donuts, WOW!  Very highly recommended as they are delicious and warm. Glad we found this gem of a place before leaving town"}
{"text":"Good donut place with unique business model to produce only fresh donuts. Staff was very friendly and the donuts were very good as well. Definitely worth stopping by when in the area."}
{"text":"The best donuts around because they make them when you order them!  Warm and fresh! We love supporting this small, family owned shop!"}
{"text":"AMAZING DONUTS! We generally get donuts from another place, but decided to change it up. Ordered a dozen random donuts and all were absolutely amazing. I love that they are made right there. There was no one donut that lacked in anything. The flavors are unique and great. My favorite is the maple bacon donut, but my co-workers loved the fluffernutter, samoa, and the lemon bavarian. I love going here and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"We have been the desert donuts 3 to 4 times. The kids absolutely love it. It's the whole experience of going through and kind of making your own donuts. I myself think that there is not a lot of flavor. Customer service was OK.but again the kids loved it. You get to watch the donuts go through the process."}
{"text":"Not a fan of cake donuts, prefer the yeast donuts BUT Desert Donuts are GREAT! They fry instead of bake the cake donuts. They have a whole different texture than baked and are pretty darn GOOD! YOU MUST TRY! What a novel idea creating your own donut. Big hit with the grandkids, too!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Owners are great and friendly staff. The donuts or simply amazing!"}
{"text":"Best HOT donuts. We'd come more often if it was closer. Favorite doughnuts of all time!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love the donuts here, we bike here every Sunday.  One complaint: the coffee.  It doesn't taste very good, and it often isn't hot enough.  Fix that, and conquer the world!"}
{"text":"Best donut place ever! The donuts are made to order and 100% customizable. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. They are so cool! They'll make your donut in front of you, everything is warm, soft and fresh! My kids love this place and are always pestering me or their grandpa to take them to the donut shop. Also, Desert Donuts is a locally owned passion project, with the owner family doing a great job of it to boot! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Made fresh to order, delicious! It's like a mix between a Krispy cream and blue star but better! Our new stop on our way up north."}
{"text":"Cool concept, and so fun to customize your own donuts! The staff/family are so hospitable, as well. I gave four stars only because cake donuts aren't my favorite as I prefer the dough style, but they are fresh and warm. Their hours are a bit hard to catch, too. I went there several times before I caught them open, but I guess that makes sense since donuts are more of a breakfast/brunch thing and I think they are family run, so it's nice to support that. It's a fun experience I would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Wow what's a great donut. Great homemade donuts in front of you and you choose your toppings. Definitely will be coming back here. If it's busy it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Not a real donut fan but these are really good! Super nice staff too! Donuts are all cake donuts but are not heavy like your typical donuts. These believe it or not are actually light and fluffy. Excellent options in flavor combinations. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"On a whim, we popped into Desert Donuts on our way out of town to Vegas.  We were in search of breakfast and there weren't too many options around, so my Husband ventured in for a donut.  He came back out with a half eaten, warm bacon covered donut and insisted we all try it.  Man oh man was it good.  The four of us quickly plowed into the restaurant and ordered more for ourselves.  The made to order donut is a genius concept.  The only thing I wish they had was other base donut favors as the blueberry cake donut it my favorite.  Anywho, just an idea... I got a simple cinnamon and sugar donut and it was quite good, not as good as the bacon one though.  Anyway... I am sure we will be back to this small, friendly donut shop.  I'm still dreaming/drooling over a warm, fresh, just how I like it donut!"}
{"text":"Such an awesome family owned business! Great customer service and the best donuts ever!! Donuts with carmel and pretzels....mmmm! Great idea to take to office or show customers appreciation."}
{"text":"I give them 2 stars do yo the fact my wife could not stand the type of donuts and dressings that slide and fall off the donut. She took one bite of a half cooked donuts and was over them.  Went next store to Albertsons and all is well."}
{"text":"Nothing like it on the East Coast!  Stopped by on a whim on our way to the Grand Canyon and so very glad that we did. Staff was super friendly and helpful. Woman behind the counter explained how they make the donuts fresh...as in they make it right after we order!  I had the breakfast bowl while my fiancé ordered The Beast and a Bavarian Cream. They start with a perfect old fashion donut and then complete by putting on the right amount of toppings without drowning it in icing. Never thought that I would try an old fashion donut with bacon and hot sauce (The Beast) but it is absolutely amazing!  You get to watch the machine as it makes your donut and drops it into the fryer!"}
{"text":"Looked at reviews for here and fractured prune. I haven't tried fractured prune but this place had better reviews so I decided to give it a shot! The bacon doughnut was the BOMB!!! Literally was not a single bad doughnut in the box and we tried 12 different ones....will be back! Honestly don't even have a desire to try fractured prune either."}
{"text":"Hands down these are best donuts I've ever had !! I'm hooked !! The Staff are super friendly too !!  Desert donuts deserves this 5 star review !!"}
{"text":"What a great locally-owned mom-and-pop style shop. I love it!  I have been here twice now - once with my better half because she wanted to try it, and once to bring a couple dozen in to work. True, they take a little longer to bring a couple duzzo to the office, but just call in your order ahead of time... they had it finishing up and waiting for me within ten minutes!  Donuts are airy and flavorful. They may be a tad on the greasy side, but let's face it, folks: you aren't eating donuts to be a health nazi. These may feel a tad greasier because of how fresh and soft they are, but if you wait a few minutes before gorging these tasty morsels into your mouth, you would realize they aren't bad at all.   The toppings were great. Almond Joy, Caramel Apple, Maple Bacon, Pink with Sprinkles (a la Homer Simpson,) are just a few of the delicious bites I got from there. The best one however is the Peanut Butter Cup.   Great staff, great concept, great owners - try it now!!!"}
{"text":"Hot donuts served anyway you desire. Not sure why this concept hasn't caught on sooner. They have some ideas for you or you can design your own masterpiece. I went for a banana bread creation and another with my own stuff. Both were really good and they were dipped upon ordering. The coffee was pretty good too which is important, but tough to get seating, especially outdoors. A bit out of the way, but a great stop before you head up the 17 nightmare."}
{"text":"Just ate here this morning. WOW!   This place is just flat out fun in every way. Very reasonably priced, absolutely amazingly delicious, fresh and made to order doughnuts. You can choose from a pre selected style or you can make your own. Lots of delicious, fresh ingredients and frostings as well. This isn't some gimmicky place either, these taste like gourmet doughnuts. Not only are the doughnuts absolutely incredible, but the coffee, which is locally grown and roasted right here in Arizona is unbelievably good to!  If only I could give this place 6/5 stars I would!"}
{"text":"This is a donut place like no other and you have to come if you are visiting Phoenix! They make the donuts right in front of you and they are served fresh and hot. Very friendly workers too and a very clean restaurant. Be aware that because they are made right in front of you, the donuts require a bit more time than other donut shops."}
{"text":"Seriously the most awesome donuts around!  Totally custom & freshly made."}
{"text":"Fresh! Fresh! Fresh!   These donuts are tasty and fresh. Made to order and unique. I got a maple iced with bacon bits, drizzled with Frank's Red Hot. Strange combo, but it was good!   Love going to mom & pop places. You should support them too."}
{"text":"Great donuts, great variety!!  The donuts are freshly  made and served nice and hot.  We will definitely be coming back. My son polished two of them in no time flat...  BTW,  the pecan pie donut is total awesomeness..."}
{"text":"I like the concept of Desert Donuts a lot! They are made fresh once you order them and you can design your own donuts. They also have a list of donuts you can choose from as well. I got the Frozen design donut because I thought it looked cool. It was yummy and sweet.  The donuts here are not like your regular cake donuts. I feel like they are doughier and softer than a normal donut, but yummy nonetheless. I think this is a fun place to take the kids so they can choose exactly what they want.   Donuts are a little smaller than standard size and $1.25, but I think it's a cute concept."}
{"text":"On our way out of Peoria headed for Sedona and we needed gas and breakfast.  The name \"dessert donuts\" was catchy and I love donuts!  We stopped in for a late breakfast.  All the donuts are made fresh- BONUS!  We decided to add a little protein to our breakfast, LOL, and ordered the Deluxe Breakfast Bowl with a Bacon Blast donut on the side.  The deluxe bowl is a donut, topped with eggs, sausage gravy, bacon and cheese.  So delicious that I quickly discounted the calories down to zero because I'm on vacation and my friends back in Chicago are suffering with -10 with the wind chill and its 60 right now.  Getting back to the bowl the sweetness and savory are a good blend and you can't go wrong with this choice.  The Bacon Blast Donut was also delicious and the fresh donut base was amazing, just too good!  Thanks for starting my day out on a good foot.  Everyone in the shop was helpful, welcoming and checked to make sure we had a great experience.  Come to the western suburbs of Chicago."}
{"text":"We love Desert Donuts!! Fresh, made to order donuts that are still warm when you get them!! The staff is awesome, too!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow.  It's so cool to watch them make the donuts fresh right in front of you.  There isn't anything in a case. Your donuts are made when you order them.  We ordered the Carlton, Bacon Blast, the Beast, Apple Pie, Chocolate Rainbow and the Oreo.  Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. We ordered 2 dozen and ended up taking 5 home.  This is definitely going to be a regular stop whenever I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Delicious donuts made right in front of you. Whether you are a cake donut person or a light and airy donut person, these donuts will be sure to please. I just wish they were a little closer!"}
{"text":"I never yelp but I am donut obsessed and these were the actual best donuts I've ever had! With fact that they are warm, fresh, and made to order how can you go wrong? But then when I got home and actually tasted the deliciously on point flavor I was super impressed! I moved into the neighborhood about a month ago and had been meaning to get in there, so glad I gave it a try! The customer service was also great, when I stepped up to order and told the gentleman I was new he gave me a full run down on the options; I also left with two delightful, genuine smiles and well wishes from the staff!   ...now I just need to make sure I'm not eating donuts everyday with this place being so close..."}
{"text":"Nothing better then a fresh warm donut made to order! Mmmmm! Staff was super friendly, the lady at the register took the time to talk us through the process of ordering as it was our first visit! Our donuts came out in about five minutes and were everything I hoped they would be! We will definitely be coming back to this gem!"}
{"text":"The freshest donuts you'll ever eat! They are made to order and come in a variety of different flavors like apple pie, almond joy, etc. or you can customize your toppings."}
{"text":"We LOVE Desert Donuts! We have moved from North Phoenix over to the West Valley and still make a point to have donuts there. The donuts are fresh and delicious and there are so many toppings to pick from! To make it better, the people are extremely friendly!! You need to try this place :)"}
{"text":"I honestly don't think I can go to any other donut shop ever again. Donuts are delicious! Tons of combos and you can create your own as well!!! Even the classic donut is tastier than any other donut. I went in with my 1 year old (who also loved the donuts!) and ordered a dozen- variety of their own creations. Not only did the come out hot and delicious, but FAST! We live close by and will definitely be coming here more often."}
{"text":"Amazing donut! Hot and fresh, made to order!!    I never had a donut made to order until now!! Great taste, and great customer service! Only problem was.... I didn't get a picture of the donut because I ate it too fast, soooooo yummy :) give em a try!"}
{"text":"Such a fun place!  Not only are the donuts made to order right in front of you, but they're served WARM and with kind service.  Great experience!"}
{"text":"My mom and I accidentally found this place heading out of town.  It caught me a little off guard when I did not see doughnuts, but then learned that they are made to order. I recommend that you order more than you think you need because these doughnuts are addictive."}
{"text":"Mmm... donuts!!! *drool*   This cute little shop makes the most delicious old-fashioned cake-style donuts I've ever had... in a long long time. I've craved those old-fashioned kind of donuts for so long, and attempted to get my fix with store bought ones, but it never did the trick. I wish I would've known about Desert Donuts sooner -- oh boy, they take me back to my younger years when I would go on field trips to the apple orchard and got to eat a fresh-made cake-style donut and drink fresh apple cider... those were the days!   I walked in (looking like a lost puppy since I had never been here before), and was greeted by the amazing staff. They walked me through the method behind the madness and how to end up with a mouth-watering donut sure to satisfy your tastebuds and tummy. First things first, the donut dough/base is all the same yummy dense cake-style donut. Then once the donut is made fresh-to-order, (yes, they literally make them in front of you), they will dip it, dunk it, swirl it, top it, and drizzle whatever kind of yummy toppings you've chosen. (Don't worry if you don't know exactly what you want, they have pre-made selections you can choose from.)  My favorite donuts so far are the S'mores, Chunky Monkey, Apple Pie, and Chocolate Strawberry. I love that the toppings are true to their name and not fake-tasting -- as in, the chocolate strawberry, tastes like you're biting into a juicy chocolate-covered strawberry! The Chunky Monkey has banana icing that tastes like real bananas (and then of course, it's topped off with peanuts and a chocolate drizzle).   I may or may not have eaten like 4 donuts out of the dozen that I bought (you snooze, you lose... lose out on donuts, that is, hehe). They're so pretty to look at (see photo), and taste just as scrumptious as you'd imagine. It may be a bit out of your way, but trust me... definitely worth the trip and the calories!"}
{"text":"These things are awesome! Made to order and so many flavors so the whole fam was satisfied. Kids loved peanut butter cup and chocolate rainbow. My fave was the 'Beast' with bacon, cinnamon and, wait for it... siracha. They are best fresh in the store but the dozen we took home didn't last more than 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Holy crap these are amazing. Donuts fried to order right in front of you. Clean environs, friendly staff, fantastic selection -- and quite reasonable prices. You'll never want to step into a Dunkin again."}
{"text":"If you love donuts, I recommend you stop!  We found this little place by accident. It didn't come up in our initial Yelp search. I'm so glad we found it!  You pick which of the specialty donuts you want (they typically have 12 choices each day). Then, they make your donut to order. Fresh, fun, unique.  The donuts have a crispy edge that I loved. They are not quite a heavy cake donut and yet not the light commercial style either. A balance of the two.  We tried Bavarian, Almond Joy, Chunky Monkey, and Caramel delight. The one I wish I tried...Bacon Blast, but I left myself a reason to return soon."}
{"text":"What have I stumbled into??!! We were in Morristown enjoying the day and taking our God daughter on her first horseback ride at the ranch. Before we got there I mentioned getting donuts. And not the small powdery kind but a big donut. Her eyes lit up like Christmas. On our way back we saw the sign and perfect, a donut place. We walk in and MY eyes lit up like Christmas! No racks full of donuts, but a really cool machine and a bar with rainbow colored icing and toppings galore. The very nice man at the counter (assumed the owner) allowed me time to just gaze about. A cook to order donut shop! Who ever heard of such a place! Well now I have and have to recommend you come check this place out. The best donut you ever had. Hot and fresh, and surprisingly quick. You should get a coffee, too as it was very tasty and a great variety. Thank you Desert Donuts for the wonderful experience!! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Our first time through, we created a sampler plate of sorts. I'm not much for donuts so I'm just going to relay what the family said: amazing, crazy flavors, fresh, mmmmmmmmm.  Personally, I think there were too many options and they weren't all in one organized place. That makes taking younger children (and a donut-crazy husband) there quite a drawn out process. I also think it's all the people in front of you in line struggling with their decisions that creates the long wait.  All in all, if you live in the area and you want a yummy, quirky donut, then this is your place. But a tip for the parents: you know what your kids like. Leave them at home and go solo."}
{"text":"These donuts are absolutely ridiculous!  Individually handmade to order, perfect presentation, fresh and hot.  I never thought such artistic excellence could be applied to a mere donut.  I drive 30 minutes each way for these beautiful babies!"}
{"text":"Hand down the best donuts I've ever had. They have all kinds of unique flavors or you can make your craziest ideas come to life. All donuts are made to order, not just sitting on a rack for hours. I'd highly recommend this place, and the cowboy is a must!"}
{"text":"Our family ate at Desert Donut for the first time last Sunday and we made sure to come back again today. These are hands down the best donuts we have ever had! They are warm and melt in your mouth. Worth every calorie!"}
{"text":"Probably the best donuts I've ever had!   Melissa R. told me about this place & as soon as she said \"made fresh right in front of you\" I HAD to try it out. You place your order for however many donuts you want, then you pick your icings & toppings.  I was a little overwhelmed at first because there were so many choices, there was a menu of some popular choices so I used that the help me decide. I ordered a lemon bar & a s'mores donut. They fry them right in front of you & serve them piping hot.  AMAZING!  They were so fluffy & delicious, the lemon bar was absolutely phenomenal, I have been thinking about that dang donut ever since we visited! The s'mores one was great to but the lemon stole the show.  Counting down until I visit again which I hope is extremely soon!"}
{"text":"This shop always has a pleasant environment. The owners are friendly and will have you leaving happy. They take pride in what they do and it shows through the taste of their donuts. Recommended to the fullest extent."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this place you need to!! Best donuts I have ever had! So many choices and create your own! Great prices and friendly staff!!!!"}
{"text":"We Absolutely love this family owned donut shop. The employees are always friendly and excited that you're there.. cool vibes. Fresh coffee and ice tea.  They have many choices of fresh doughnuts to choose from but not an overwhelming amount. (Which I like.) Fresh warm, made in front of you donuts that never disappoint.  Love the chocolate cream filled and lemon bar personally.. my kids love creating their own.   Also, like the new point system they just started offering!   I highly recommend Desert Donuts!  They're often imitated but never duplicated.. (The fractured prune has nothin' on these donuts!)   Great family own shop with the freshest donuts."}
{"text":"If only I lived in Arizona..... literally the best donuts ever! my sister and I saw a sign while driving on the highway, looked it up and got up early on the day we were flying out just to drive here to get donuts, and wished we had come earlier in our vacay because we would've come every day of our trip. Totally worth it, totally warm, fresh and delicious. Wishing they'd franchise, because I'd definitely work at one in Chicago!"}
{"text":"Took the opportunity to have a donut this morning.  My DH and I stopped by and not big donut consumers we were impressed with the fresh tasty's donuts.  They are amazing warm.  We had a Bavarian Cream, Snickers, chocolate and raspberry filled.  They were all really good.  The staff was friendly and inviting.  Would recommend if you are looking for a sweet fix."}
{"text":"These donuts are delicious. I bought an assorted dozen for my coworkers and got rave reviews. They're a little more expensive than grocery store donuts but well worth it because you taste the freshness and they have a wide variety of creative choices."}
{"text":"OMGosh! The best donut I have ever had! They make it to order, you choose the toppings and it comes out hot and delicious! I got caramel and toasted coconut and it was amazing! They also serve coffee, fresh beans delivered weekly! Espresso , and fresh iced tea made brewed with tea leaves. I am definitely going to be a regular. I just got home and I'm craving it already"}
{"text":"Donut Shops are on the rise in the Metro Phoenix Area and Desert Donuts is certainly unique. The Donuts are made fresh to order. At the time of this review the sweet fresh donuts are priced at $1.50 each and you get a fresh cooked to order vanilla cake donut that you can have with a variety of toppings and or fillings. They also offer breakfast donuts topped with eggs and bacon.  I looked at all the choices and went blank so I got one I saw on the menu, the Boston cream. My donut was hot and fresh. It was a light cake batter that wasn't too sweet and the toppings were tasty.  Maybe as this Donut Shop gets more popular they can offer a couple more flavors of donuts like chocolate or cinnamon?  The people working there were very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Best customer service I'd gladly give these people my money over a chain of rude people. Great doughnuts great people I'm only coming here from now on"}
{"text":"Donuts are tasty but super small, you can finish it in like three bites. Lots of options for toppings. They were \"backed up\" and the orders were taking forever to come out, even though there were only 5 customers in the entire place. The employees are kinda weird, they sing and talk rudely to each other. All you see is them moving slow and having conversations with each other. They forgot our coffee, and didn't really care about it when we brought it up."}
{"text":"Very cool and unique concept. Good donuts both sweet and savory. Local coffee always a plus."}
{"text":"Fantastic customer service is key to a successful business. The management at Desert Donuts understands this and employs fantastic individuals. I am always welcomed like family every time I visit. The donuts are fresh and are piping hot. I'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"I have never been to a place where you can get a made to order doughnut. Interesting concept. The doughnut of the day was covered in nacho cheese and fritos. Although I wasn't that adventurous, I did enjoy my 'almond joy' (chocolate frosting with almonds and coconut), and the sampling of the maple bacon. You can choose a doughnut off the menu, or build your own with a variety of frosting and toppings. The doughnuts were not too heavy, and being made to order they were nice and warm. Friendly, family run establishment."}
{"text":"We came here one morning on our spring break. The people were so friendly and the place quiet and clean.  We came on the morning where they were doing a 2 donut and milk special. We got 6 donuts for us and kids.  We got a few of the specialty donuts, including the maple bacon, the carmel delight and the sweet and salty. They were really warm and yummy. We got a raspberry inside out filled and it was good but messy."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly and the donuts are pretty good as long as you design a good combo of flavors and toppings.  Their examples are helpful, just wish they had more pictures of recommendations"}
{"text":"Awesome Donuts people!! I ordered mine with Cinnamon Sugar, Maple topping with....wait for it........BACON. They warmed it up slightly and it was heaven. Holy crap what a combo. We drove from the outskirts of Surprise just to have one. Seriously, the only reason we went. 30 mile round trip. I would have done it if gas was $5 a gallon. CRAZY"}
{"text":"BEST donut shop around!! Great customer service, and delicious donuts! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Wonderful donuts at a terrific price.  Everyone that works there is great.  So glad a small business that took a chance is doing so well.  Love it."}
{"text":"These are by far THE best donuts I have ever had in my life! My brother lives out here and brought us here yesterday. The workers are very friendly, the delux bowl and the donuts are so dreamy. We will drive 6 hours to come back. So delicious!"}
{"text":"These donuts are made fresh for you while you wait! They were awesome! Highly recommend this place...the coffee tasted really good as well!"}
{"text":"I feel like I say this every time I try a donut shop in the phoenix/Scottsdale area, but Desert Donuts has the best donuts I've had in the phoenix area. One thing that makes them stand out from the rest is that they make the donuts after you order them, not just picking them out from a case. The downside of this is only having the regular donut base, but that is not at all an issue for me haha. They have a bunch of different flavor combinations! Like there was a bunch to choose from. We got half a dozen and there were still a few we need to come back and try. The donuts are warm and delicious, a little smaller and more dense than other donuts, but still light and totally amazing. My favorite I tried was probably the fluffernutter or caramel with pretzels. I was worried the pretzels would be soggy but since it was fresh it gave the perfect crunch. I didn't try it, but the only one my boyfriend didn't like very much was the maple bacon, he said there was just too much bacon and it wasn't crispy enough. His favorite was the cinnamon sugar one! The one with coconut, caramel, and chocolate was amazing too. I am so glad we found this gem and we can't wait to try the s'mores and Oreos donuts next trip!"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!!!!!! and you have to try all of the donuts. The donuts are made to order. They come out warm and Delicious. These are the best donuts you will ever try. They use fresh ingredients!  Cant wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Was in the Phoenix area for three days and everyday I made a stop here!  Fresh, hot, made to order donuts?!  Yes please!! I really don't think you can go wrong with any choice donut you decide to make.  I had a Bavarian cream, cinnamon & sugar, s'more, and the chocolate coma.  All were so good! Would have made a fourth stop there on the way to the airport if they were open later! :-)  Great place! Great Donuts! and Love that they are a local family run business! Everyone was very friendly and happy! Definitely a place not to be missed!"}
{"text":"A little pricy for a dozen but you really don't need that many! They are super filling and only $1.50 a piece. Custom, creative, and very fresh!"}
{"text":"So refreshing to have a homemade, warm, cake donut. And the cake is so soft and fluffy. Not too sweet - just right for the toppings.  The Lemon was scrumptious. My husband wanted a traditional Bavarian cream donut but was not disappointed with Desert Donut's version.   This is a trek for us to come here but we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My first time there as my hubby had not stopped talking about it since he found it on his way to Sedona. Family owned and hands on the job. Very friendly, delightful people. The donuts were excellent.  I too tried the bacon maple and it was delicious. Actually we bought a dozen, and although not quite as good as eating them on location, they were fine next day. If you like cake donuts you will love the wide selection offered hot straight from the donut machine.  Very clean, and super friendly."}
{"text":"Great selection of made to order donuts, not a quick alternative, so if you're in a hurry, don't expect to get in and out quickly...go to another source.  BUT, if your looking for a great, fresh, HOT, made to order do-nut experience, this IS YOUR PLACE!!!  Their staff is awesome, and truly believe in their product, cranking them out as quickly as a made to order do-nut can be cranked out...after all, it is a creation, not billion a day process like Dunkin, or the other similar pastry places!  We loved the experience!!  Give them a try, you'll be glad you did!!!"}
{"text":"When you walk in you see pictures of different donuts and all the toppings that are available.  This is one of those \"we custom make your donuts to order\" shops.  It's a little hard to order as the menu is a selection of donuts, there are more creations written on the walls, and pictures of donuts scattered around.    They make the donuts pretty quickly.  Our server/cook screwed up one of our donuts and proceeded to toss it away and make another one.  It took a bit of time to remake and it made me wonder why they don't throw incorrect orders into the customers' boxes.  It seems like an easy win."}
{"text":"I had Desert Donuts for the first time at a work potluck and it was love at first bite. Since then I have been coming here for the past year. They have a few flavors already made but my favorite part is customizing my own donut. The donuts are made to order so you can pick your icing and toppings. They are just the perfect size to have 2 or 3 without feeling guilty."}
{"text":"I seldom eat doughnuts as they are sweet and I don't do many sweets with any regularity. After my experience here I'll never be able to look a normal doughnut in the eyes again.  I found myself waiting for a customer to meet me in the parking lot and had heard several people say the doughnuts here were good, especially the bacon one.  I was totally unprepared for a custom fresh cooked doughnut.  I chose the Bacon Blast from the menu.  Then I got to watch them make my doughnut from scratch as it went in the fryer.  Then they dipped it in maple icing followed by a generous portion of thick cut bacon crumbles.  This was not a take back to the office doughnut, it was made to be eaten while still warm and soft and gooey.  And I did. :)  As an added bonus, at $1.25 it was reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing doughnut!! Doughnuts created to your liking as you sip on delicious coffee. Cute shop with plenty of seating. Staff is happy and friendly. Watching them create your doughnut masterpieces is awesome. I'll have to bring the kids next time. The doughnuts are cake and warm. The frosting melts a little and there is a little crunch to the doughnut. YUMMY!!"}
{"text":"We really loved this place.  We stopped here on our way to Sedona.  Best donuts!  The breakfast bowl was delicious, too!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!  New here in town and this was on a list of must try items, needless to say, I made it here this morning!  I bought two for myself and two for my wife; I had the Bacon Blast and Carlton... both were GREAT!  We will undoubtedly be back on a regular basis now that we around just around the corner."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!! The donuts are sooo warm and soft! Lots of different types or frosting and toppings to choose from! More on the heavier side for a donut but very good!!! Loved the caramel frosting with Oreos! Yummmmy!"}
{"text":"These donuts are worth going out of your way for. The donuts are delicious melt in your mouth good and are made fresh to order with endless topping choices. My kids beg to go here very weekend."}
{"text":"I am so glad they are not down the road. I would be 600lbs. These donuts are as fresh as they get. AMAZING!! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Delish....my family loves their donuts.  Everyone needs to eat at Desert Donuts!!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Carefree, AZ! The donuts are made fresh right in front of you and the coffee and tea are high quality. Great customer service and the prices are reasonable too! This is a great place to take people who are from out of town. They are always impressed!"}
{"text":"We walked in and immediately were greeted by owner and staff. I told him it was my 2nd time in and he suggested we take a look at the donut favorites that have been voted by customers. We pretty much ordered one of each. The bacon blast is a MUST!!!! Seriously so flavorful. I also ordered a iced latte which was very tasty as well.   The texture of the donut was so good! So soft and light. Didn't feel like it was heavy at all.   The raspberry filling is also another I recommend. :)  Owners obviously take pride in this biz and it shows well."}
{"text":"First time stopping in this morning. The workers were so nice and the donuts were to die for. These were the most unique and the best donuts I've ever had. I can't wait to visit again and load up on donuts!"}
{"text":"Neat concept. As I described \"the chipotle of donuts\" . At first I came in w the intention of getting a dozen donuts but that's about $3 more than others...but I can taste the fresh difference for sure. Who knew?!?! Maybe they have some coupon offers for locals. I was camping and followed highway signs. I enjoyed Bavarian cream. Kids enjoyed pink ice (different from strawberry) and a triple chocolate topping. Maybe a glazed option? Keep it up! We will visit again."}
{"text":"Super yummy!!! Can't just eat one.  They are prepared to however you want them and fresh and hot every time."}
{"text":"My son and I stopped in this morning to see the shop and we were warmly greeted by the staff.  We were a bit confused when we did not see any donuts! The staff filled us in quickly and we were ready to order.  My son had the OMG - cinnamon sugar, maple icing and bacon.  I had caramel with coconut.  Both were terrific.  At only a dollar a donut we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"First time here, have never heard of a custom donut shop that will literally put any toppings you want on a donut. I went with the almond joy and peanut butter cup. They were both amazing. Donuts are so soft and moist. Best donuts in the Phoenix area by far. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"GREAT donuts.  Fresh made to order - hot and crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  Staff is very friendly.  Lots of options and very convenient off the highway behind the gas station."}
{"text":"Fam and I were eating a few doors down and heard about this place and decided to check it out after lunch. They were literally closing in 6 minutes and I hate and never want to be that person that comes in right before closing but I don't come this north that often and we really wanted to eat donuts...cause donuts. They were soooo nice about it and accommodating. We hurried up and ordered! I got the Carmel delight and my uncle got the apple pie. They have a base donut and you can customize your donut with various toppings or choose one of their original creations. Each donut fried as you order and then they put the toppings on as you watch. It was so warm and soft and just the right amount of sweetness...not too overwhelming. Yummy. There is another donut shop down the freeway with a similar concept....(don't wanna name names...) but I would say desert donuts is better!!"}
{"text":"What a great donut stop. We visited multiple times during our stay. The staff and donuts were both wonderful!"}
{"text":"This is a family donut shop with a crazy assortment of flavors that my daughter and I like to sneak away to while her mom sleeps in (but we bring her home warm donuts).   When you come in move to the back where the cash register is to order. If you've not been here before, take your time and look at the suggestions taped to the case.   When you order, start with how many donuts (a dozen, go for it) and the cashier will call out the number so they can start making your donuts. As they begin to make your donuts you can tell the cashier what you want. On our first visit we asked them to \"surprise us\". On that visit one donut had cheese and Fritos it (the only one from here we ever haven't liked).  Once they have your order and have made fresh donuts, one of the guys behind the counter loads up a plate with your donuts and tops them appropriately (or inappropriately if you like cheese and Fritos).   Finally, loaded in a box, they ask you if you want the box taped (or if you will be consuming the dozen, directly, at one of the tables immediately).  It is a little bit of a drive from our house but has been worth it  each time. Of course, that makes it that much more treat. I like the donuts warm, and they sell half dozens, but they are good the second day (so go for the whole dozen).  But I'd avoid the Fritos and cheese."}
{"text":"Mmmm... Donuts!  This place is just plain fun.  Fresh, warm donuts, made to order.  All kinds of creative ideas or pick your own.   Good coffee and a comfortable place to relax round it all out.  Try it you will like it."}
{"text":"Just come here and you will see why it's rated a 4.5 out of 5 (actually deserves a straight 5 stars!!!)."}
{"text":"They Named a Donut after me! if you check my previous review I suggested you try the Apple pie with Bacon caramel and Pecans. Well we tweeked it and \"the Carlton\" was born yes the description has a typo but they left it cause all my friends razz me about it! Love, Love, Love, this place,the staff, and the donuts. Have invented two donuts for you to try! I give you the Extreme Elvis Tm. : Banana frosting, chopped peanuts, Peanut butter drizzle, and BACON!"}
{"text":"The doughnuts here are very flavorful but the size of them and the service is what brought the experience down. The people making and serving the doughnuts were not very welcoming and made the atmosphere feel awkward and uncomfortable. My affogato (espresso with ice cream) came out late because they forgot about it and didn't even write it down. And they weren't sorry about it coming out late either. The time to receive your doughnut feels like a very long time because the people who work here just were goofing around and taking their time with everything. Also there is no music on the speakers playing but you will hear plenty of (bad) singing from all of the employees. Even when we left they didn't acknowledge us or say goodbye and I would understand if they were busy but there were around 5 other people in the place. These employees need to learn better customer service skills and some manners."}
{"text":"I made my first trip to Desert Donuts today and oh boy!  I went thinking I would get a crueller or bear claw and found something far superior... donuts made on the spot, piping hot with my personal choice of toppings!!!  I purchased 4 to go... awesome!  Couple things... go online, choose your toppings in advance and better yet, call in your order as the line can be rather long.  They offer fresh roasted coffee from Passport Coffee, a local roaster in Scottsdale so the java is just as great as the donuts!  One thing... check your order, sometimes they miss a topping."}
{"text":"This place seems popular because it's fresh - made to order donuts.  We stopped by Desert Donuts and bought a few for the road.  I bit into one right away.  The donuts are great and all but I don't really notice any difference between a regular donut and the donuts here.  They're good though, but all donuts are good."}
{"text":"Wow, great concept! Build your own donut!  Cooked when you order, you pick the toppings. Delicious."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places! The staff is always great and friendly! I try at least one new flavor every visit and have my usual strawberry lemonade. They never disappoint!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  I recommended this  place and boy this place doesnt disappoint! Hot fresh doughnuts  with some  not so normal toppings! My kids beg to go back for more! This  place is a great place to have coffee and doughnuts and read a book!  They even have books  for you to read if you find yourself without a book"}
{"text":"Best donut shop EVER! I love the concept of hot, made to order donuts, but what sets this shop apart is that the are CAKE donuts! Overwhelming options. Super nice and friendly staff. It's a 10!"}
{"text":"WOW!! What a great concept. They make donuts one at a time and then dip it in the icing and then toppings of your choice. These donuts are very hot and fresh made to order little pieces of heaven!!"}
{"text":"Cute place. Good donut really. My favorite was the classic. The pumpkin spice was really good too. Some of them were too sweet for my taste."}
{"text":"Awesome, unique and delicious doughnuts. I love that they make the doughnut fresh, right in front of you. Worth every penny.  If you're trying to make an impression, bring some of these to your next business meeting."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Desert Donuts for a couple of years now and have never once thought the donuts were anything less than amazing.  Atmosphere: Very relaxed, with soft music in the background, making it a great place to get some homework done. They have six tables, plus additional outside seating.  Service: These people are always happy to see customers. Never once has anyone looked unhappy or treated me in an unpleasant way. The owner loves to stop by and talk with customers, making everyone feel welcome.  Food: In my opinion, Desert Donuts is the best place in Arizona for donuts. I have had donuts from Bosa, Rainbow, and many other locations, with none coming close to the flavor that Desert delivers. The creativity behind their donut ideas is pure genius. Prickly pear hot sauce on a donut? Who would have known how amazing that would be combined with a few other ingredients?  Location: It is a little bit of a drive from the valley, but that may be a good thing seeing as I would come here every other day if it were closer. It's located in a congested shopping plaza, just west of Albertson's Food.  Five out of five stars is an easy score to give this place. If you make it out here, ask to try \"The Beast\" donut. That is pure deliciousness from the heavens. :)"}
{"text":"Had this place bookmarked for over a year but it's so far north (I live in Chandler lol) and every time JD get up that way for a trip to the mountains it'd be so early they wouldn't even be open yet. That all changed this past Sunday as some friends and I made our way up to Fossil Creek mid-morning. Immediately upon walking in it becomes clear this place is like the same format as Fractured Prune. Now I am a fan of all donuts believe me but Fractured Prune has oftentimes left me desiring more. Desert Donuts on the other hand is the mom and pop alternative to the same style (donut decorated to order) providing much better quality. I ordered the monthly special Pink Lemonade donut and was surprised how much the flavor combo actually worked out. It was delicious! I'll try to make Desert Donuts a regular morning stop going forward before heading up North."}
{"text":"Ive been here multiple times and customer service has always been mediocre.  Donuts are warm & fresh with good flavor, but it is a long wait.  I also had to remind the cashier that I ordered an affogato, it would of been nice to recieve with my donut.  The talking amongst the employees is about personal information, singing off tune and loud, I suggest to play music in the background.  It will help with the ambiance & mood."}
{"text":"Seriously if you havent given this place a shot yet, your missing out. Such friendly people, amazing food! I cant get enough."}
{"text":"Wow! Nothing better than a fresh donut, made to order.  I'm glad I don't live very close to here -- I'd probably be twice my size!  Friendly staff, incredible donuts."}
{"text":"Great customer service! Delicious and fresh (literally). Wide variety. A very neat atmosphere. Used books to look at. They are not pre-made so it's a small wait after you order. More then ready-to-box donuts. Cake donuts but so fresh that they melt in your mouth. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Their homemade donuts are amazing. The owner is a down to earth guy who takes tremendous pride in his business. You have to stop by this place."}
{"text":"Very good donuts! Very nice people every time I have stepped foot in this location. I have been a couple time and will continue to enjoy there donuts in the future. Thanks again desert donut staff! Especially today's!"}
{"text":"Desert Donuts never disappoints. Friendly staff. They are delicious, fresh, made-to-order donuts. AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic concept. You walk in to a spacious space where you receive a warm greeted.  You order your donut(s) ala carte and they are made for you fresh in the spot. You choose your glaze(s) and any toppings and they are a dollar each or 11$ for a dozen. I had the maple topped donut with bacon.. OMG. I can't wait to pick up my son from school and come back in a couple of hours!!"}
{"text":"The best donuts ever. Seriously. I can't even express to you how badly you need these donuts in your life! And the staff is super friendly too! I can't wait to visit again next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"A fun place to stop and enjoy a sweet treat anytime of the day.   The doughnuts are made fresh to order so it will be warm when bite into it.   Lots of varieties of flavors of toppings to choose from.  Be adventurous and tell the servers what you're craving for."}
{"text":"They have taken donuts to another level!.  I'll admit when I walked in I was put off by the Chipotle style toppings bar.  It just didn't make sense to me how this could work for donuts.  Well it does!!!!    You start off by walking up to the cashier and letting her know what and how many you want.  They offer prefixed signature flavors plus you can go all Fro-yo on them and design your own donut.  I ordered 3 different prefixed types, The Bacon Blast, The Caramel Delight and The Chunky Monkey.  Imagine my surprise when the cashier yelled \"3!\" and the dropped the donut in the hot grease right there in front of me.  Woah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Then they lady working the line dressed them up with appropriate toppings, boxed them up and sent me packing.  Now that is fresh and fast!  The Caramel delight was very Girl Scout Samoan cookie like.  Delish.  THe Chunky monkey was a donut with banana icing, peanuts and a chocolate drizzle.  So good!  The star was the Bacon Blast.  Now I have had several bacon maple style donuts before but this one one was phenomenal!  The bacon was chewy and had a very smoked pork flavor that worked perfect on the maple icing.  The best version of this donut that I have ever had.    The donuts alone are not overly sweet.  The sweetness is in the toppings.  The offer breakfast bowls which come with a donut with cheese bacon and an egg on top.  Sounds strange but I think it would work since the donuts are not very sweet.  The also offer a variety of coffee's.   The best part about this place is they are cheaper than Dunkin or Krispy Kreme.    I'm actually glad I don't live close by or I would be fatter than I already am."}
{"text":"Best donuts i have ever had. My young daughter loves this place. Aside from having amazing Donuts, a creative selection, and more than fair prices. Desert Donuts has some of the best staff ive ever seen. Courteous and professional. I wish the owners all the best for sharing their business with us."}
{"text":"I have been really wanting to try these donuts, based on both a friend's recommendation and the really positive reviews here.  My husband and I pulled up at 12:45 and approached the store.  Not knowing their hours, because a female employee was holding the door open so they were not visible, we walked up ready to get donuts.  I thought it was odd that the employee was just standing in the door staring me in the face with only what could be described as a glare.  I made eye contact and still she never acknowledged us.  I smiled, awkwardly, in an attempt to be friendly, but she still wouldn't acknowledge us.  When she finished talking to a girl who was walking out, we started to try to go in, and she gave me the dirtiest/oddest look.  She never tried to engage us or greet us.  I peeked over her shoulder and saw that several employees were stacking chairs on the table, and realized they were closing.  I said \"oh, are you guys closing?\".  The woman, still standing in the doorway, in the oddest most off putting way, shouted \"yes\" right into my face and closed the door.  I wish I could explain how awkward and unexpected this encounter was.  Both my husband and I just stood there looking at each other, thinking...did that really just happen?  My husband said to me \"I thought she was going to shoulder check you\".  That's how this woman's attitude came across in both posture and facial expression.    I rarely if ever leave negative reviews, because I hate doing it.  I just felt it was important that it be communicated that the employees are not friendly and they close early."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!!!  This fresh made donut niche that's popping up can be hit and miss, in terms of flavors.   Desert Donuts is a definite hit!!  I have only tried a few of the flavors, but the one that stands out the most are the maple bacon donuts.   Oh my goodness.  A hot, crispy and soft donut, smothered in maple glaze, then topped with a bunch of bacon.  Cmon people.  We we born for this stuff!  I'm glad my work is almost right across the street.  Once I get into a morning shift again, this will be my foot spot for some serious bacon gorging!"}
{"text":"Amazing donuts!  Just stopped by on our way to the airport for a quick bite with the kids.  The variety of specialty donuts makes the decision making difficult, however everyone absolutely loved what they picked.  I just wish there was one of these back in California."}
{"text":"Design your own donut. Each one made fresh and as delicious as the first. My daughter and I stopped in before our little road trip to the grand canyon ( what a pleasant surprise ) The staff very nice and the place very clean. YUMMY!!! Just thinking about it I want one"}
{"text":"LOVE mom and pop shops that do well.  REALLY well.  Owner leaves high tech for a life of fried dough with many different toppings.  Batch made to order. YES to order.  First stop on our way to the Grand Canyon. BACON topped doughnuts.  I went for one with apple pie filling, caramel and bacon bits... real bacon bits.  SINFUL!  I watched while they made a box of jewel glistening doughnuts for a little girls birthday party.  Beautifully lined, and each perfectly crafted. And the coffee? $2 for a tall wonderful cup o' joe.  Seriously."}
{"text":"First thing, before I get to the donuts, the people that work here are amazing! I put in an order over the phone and when I arrived to pick it up all three people working said hello and were all smiles. Upon paying I left what I thought to be a couple dollars in the tip jar and went on my way. 10 minutes later I received a phone call and the woman working told me there was a twenty hidden behind a one and she figured that it was an accident that I left it. To be honest I had no clue I even had a 20$ in my wallet, she could have kept it and I would have never known. But she didn't. That is extremely honest and just shows how great their customer service is.   Now to the donuts, they are so yummy. I picked up a dozen for a play date and all the moms and kids loved them. We got the s'mores, maple bacon, maple and white icing. All of them were very fresh tasting. I would definitely reccomend this place!"}
{"text":"My family and I are new to the area. This morning when I realized that I was out of creamer, rather then running the kids through the store we decided to visit this place for some donuts and coffee. I am SO glad we did!!! I never knew there was a place where my kids could create their OWN donuts, not to mention my coffee was PERFECT! We will definitely be coming back. Love love love!"}
{"text":"Kids enjoyed the freshly made donuts and the fact that you get to choose your own flavors.  Cool concept!  Staff was friendly and efficient!"}
{"text":"Came from Indianapolis. We first tried these donuts after our hot air balloon ride last year. Came back again and had the BACONATOR!! AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"I have never dared dream of such a place, let alone hear of this becoming a new tread.  MADE TO ORDER DONUTS WITH CUSTOM TOPPINGS.    Boy am I glad that my husband wanted donuts that morning, on our way up I17.  We saw the sign for Desert Donuts and took the exit.   Friendly welcoming and quick explanation, 5 mins and we were out the door with a box of fresh cake donuts with custom toppings. FANTASTIC!  I am glad we were just visiting though - or I would be here getting donuts for every office birthday, school function, or whatever reason I could come up with to get Desert Donuts.  They aren't cheap but they are affordable and worth it!  Located in the strip mall, a couple doors down from Albertson's. - which is handy if you need a nearby restroom."}
{"text":"I was so excited to find this place! Made to order donuts, and fresh coffee  I had the Bavarian cream donut and the chocolate coma, so amazing! I highly recommend this place! Everyone who works there is so nice too!!"}
{"text":"Finally tried this place this morning! Wow! So many varieties of donuts. We ended up ordering 4 kinds. Lemon bar, caramel delight, black and white and banana.  All were amazing! The caramel reminded me of Girl Scout Samoa cookies and the lemon bar was refreshing! The donuts are moist and warm with all the gooey goodness of all the toppings. They have so many choices of donuts that we will for sure be back! Loved every one!"}
{"text":"While I was in there multiple people left because of the concept. It is like getting an easy bake oven and saying \"I'm going to open a bakery!\" The frosting's where all glazed over and had to be stirred which made the donuts come out clumpy. Not the place to go when you need a dozen to take into the office. At first they look fluffy but 30 minutes later (time it takes to get to office) they shrink and are hard. Usually donuts last 5 minutes in an office of 20+ people but ended up throwing 7 away because no one ate them. The staff is very nice but I don't think the concept was well thought out."}
{"text":"Custom donuts is the way to go.  Place is quick for what it is and having fresh donuts.  I like the guys review that was wondering why they don't give away free donuts when they mess up, its probably because you didn't pay for it.  I went to another similar place down in Nortera and I like this one more  for whatever reason."}
{"text":"We were travelling back from Sedona and looking for donuts to feed the kids for breakfast and stumbled upon this place. I have never seen this concept where basically they cook the donuts fresh right in front of you and they top them right there with whatever you want. Kind of like the Subway of donuts but without the sub-standard meat involved. The donuts were delicious and as fresh as you could possibly want.  My 5yr old daughter got Pink with Sprinkles and Chocolate Chips. My oldest son got Chocolate with Peanut Butter and Chocolate Chips. I got the Chocolate and Coconut with Chocolate Chips (kind of like an almond joy).  Think my 11yr old got lemon something. Can't remember what the rest of the family got. There are more out of the ordinary flavors for the adventurous like Maple and Bacon (which I will try next time).  The other thing I like about this place is that it is not a chain but is a local family owned business."}
{"text":"I went in one day and just thought I'd try it but man am I glad I did. I got the bacon donut it's my new favorite thing in the world."}
{"text":"One word, YUMMO! They don't get any fresher than this! The only criticism I have is that they only have cake donuts."}
{"text":"Donuts made fresh right in front of you!!!  Amazing flavors to choose from. Very nice and clean establishment and the staff is extremely nice and helpful!  If you need donuts and you're in this area no one can compete!!"}
{"text":"I love great customer service so I'll start with that first.  Heading up to Flag for the day we decided to stop in Anthem for a bite to eat. We passed a highway sign for donuts and the Mr. can't ever resist donuts so the decision was made to stop in. We walk in and I look around for a donut case and didn't see one so I must've had a confused look on my face because Brandon behind the register greeted us and asked if we had been in before. He then explained the concept. Each donut is freshly fried to order then you pick your toppings. Wait, so, it's not a donut made 6 hours ago?! Sign me up!   We ordered the following: Banana bread - dipped in banana frosting, and I think cinnamon and sugar and then dipped again in chocolate chips.   Peanut butter & bacon - simple, dunked in PB and fresh (real) bacon  Peanut butter cup - dunked in PB and then in chocolate chips  Maple bacon - maple sauce and big bacon crumbles.   We inhaled them so quickly I forgot to snap a pic!   The donut alone, we agreed, might be the best cake donut we've ever had. Light and airy with a crisp outside. Perfect base for the toppings. Each frosting had just the right amount of flavor but not overpowering. They're hot so the chocolate chips kind of soften up and meld with the frosting. It's pretty dang good, you guys!   Plus they're affordable at under 1.50 each. You can't beat a gormet donut at a decent price.  Thank you Brandon and \"Employee #5\" for making us feel welcome and making superb donuts. Fantastic concept! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Staff are the owners and they were all warm and friendly. Donuts were AWESOME. They have different custom donuts made to order. I had 3 different ones, caramel delight, peanut butter cup and bacon blast. All unique in taste and every bit as delicious. They are warm and soft and I will be back for more."}
{"text":"Stopped in this morning on the way to Sedona. We ordered with one of the owners & got an iced tea and 3 donuts. This place is a great concept but staff is inadequate. Took over 15 min because the girl making our donuts got confused and made the wrong kind. 2 staff members idly stood around doing nothing while customers kept coming in. The girl making the donuts for the woman that ordered after us was extremely confused also. Staff wasn't very experienced or helpful. Good idea for donut shop but very expensive for how small the donuts actually are. Took the manager awhile to even notice the girl screwed up our order. They also forgot my iced tea, I had to ask for it again. It tasted like they had made it a week ago. The manager ran up to us on the way out and apologized with a coffee coupon for next time. Not really sure why there are so many positive reviews, we sure won't be back or recommend it to others."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite donut place in the valley. The owner is always quick to greet everyone that walks through the door, and is just as quick to explain some of his tasty doughnut creations to the new comers. I love the family ran atmosphere. The doughnuts are always %100 fresh and they never disappoint. Also, if you're looking for a good cup of coffee this is the spot!"}
{"text":"Really cool place! Order each donut customized and fresh from the fryer! Best if eaten right away! Only $1 per donut!"}
{"text":"The custom-donut concept has come to life. It's the round donut, dropped in the fryer upon order (well, two of mine were already \"up\" and only the third was dropped in at time of order). Then, you choose your frosting - changes every day - some choices included: caramel, peanut butter, white, strawberry, maple, chocolate... Then you choose your topping: sprinkles, bacon, almonds, chocolate chips...  Each donut is $1.00 or $11.00 for a dozen.  The \"fresh from the fryer donut\" - strawberry w/almonds - was very light and airy - a solid 4 star tasting donut!  The other donuts - caramel w/bacon and a plain maple - each tasted a bit \"heavy\" and actually the one loaded w/bacon was slightly soggy, though the bacon was fresh and wonderful.  I probably would actually request less of the sugary topping because it seemed to render that donut soggy. They're also just a tad greasy (like you feel it on your fingers, but that's also just how fresh they are.)   The staff is very welcoming and I appreciated that. We'll go back again, for sure! and see what other combos we can create. They also offer Kona coffee, among other bevvies and there's free wi-fi.   Definitely A-OK plus a half star!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best donut place I have ever been to! The donuts are fresh and hot and you can chose whatever you want to glaze or garnish them with. So far, I have tried the raspberry filled, maple glazed, cinnamon and sugar, and lemon glazed. Every one has been better than the next!"}
{"text":"I can't believe we never stopped in here before.  We were running into Albertson and smelled the donuts and had to try one or 5.  Yummo!  we will be back."}
{"text":"I am not a donut person, last donut I had must be over 10 years ago.  With that said love this place, the concept is awesome.  They make your donuts as you order, pick your icing and toppings and receive them nice and warm.  Yummy!!!  Outstanding service and a fun experience will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"How could you rate this place any less? It has everything needed to bring happiness into your life!  I never knew this existed on a real planet, only in si-fi.. Or food-fi.. FYI: do what we did, sleep in, skip breakfast and come have donuts for lunch!"}
{"text":"Great donuts!  I know this place has been there for a couple of years, but today was the first time I went in. I'm surprised the business hours are so short. With  longer hours and better atmosphere, this would be a nice \"hang out\" place to where customer buys more than just a couple of donuts. Maybe a better seating option?    I will definitely return for more donuts! The customer service was good. I think the owner was there today."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars, I would!  Found Desert Donuts on Yelp and it is on my drive to work so I figured, why not.  Staff is SO friendly, very informative and really helpful.  The cashier helped explain how the process works, what toppings and provided great customer service.    The smell was amazing when you walk in.  You could smell the donuts cooking, and the fresh organic coffee was out of this world.    The donuts are made fresh to order, topped how you like, or you can order one of their speciality flavors.  I got Caramel Delight, chocolate coma, peanut butter cup and bacon blast.  They were AHHH-MAYYY-ZINGGGG.  I'm coming back tomorrow with the kiddos.  Desert Donuts has a customer for life!"}
{"text":"Loved the attitude and help of the owner and staff!  Just wish they'd have a non-dairy donut for ME to try.  but my husband and grandkids loved creating and eating their choices!"}
{"text":"The donuts were so delicious and fresh! I really enjoyed how you get to pick your donuts out and they make it right there in front of you. They were defiantly smaller than expected, but they were so yummy. The downside would be that the employees were chatting, singing, and goofing off. Made me feel uncomfortable and i ended up taking my donuts to go rather than eating there. Defiantly should have some background music in there if they're gonna sing like that..."}
{"text":"Great donut shop if you're in the area! They make it fresh to order.  Indoor and outdoor seating.  Get the glazed and chocolate! I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"What can you say about a place that does made to order donuts?  Great concept!  What you do is you go into this establishment and, if you've never been here before, you can see photos of their various specialities. Then, you pick your poison.   The donuts are all absolutely fresh and you can watch them creating your choice(s). When they're done the call your name. Super Fresh. Probably like no donut you've ever had.   The also have the various drinks; coffee, of course, and good lattes.   They are located in a large shopping center right off of Highway 17 so access is easy and there is plenty of parking.   Fun place ! Recommended !"}
{"text":"Desert Donuts is Arizona's Voodoo donuts... But fresher. Their version of the bacon maple donut is fantastic!  All their donuts are made right when you order them and are prepared the way you like it. That kind of freshness makes these donut creations all on their own level. They have bacon toppings, pretzels, sprinkles, nerds, dried fruit... This place is so good!  The service is top notch too! They walked us through the menu and explained everything thoroughly and well. We will be back. A lot."}
{"text":"Was surprised by the different set-up, but the donuts and flavor choices are Awesome!"}
{"text":"Deliciously freshly made warm yummy donuts.  What a delightful find as we were traveling to Sedona!  Cream filed chocolate and peanut butter stripes.  What a find..."}
{"text":"Crazy Good!!! This place is worth the drive. Be prepared as you can't just try one!  All served hot and fresh, favorite is hard to say but the sweet & salty was amazing!"}
{"text":"/TL;DR  Hole in the wall donut shop that specializes in made to order, customized donuts.  /ATMOSPHERE  It's like walking into the front of a shoe box. It's you, the counter, and a lot of glass. Seating is minimal, but you're not here for that.  /FOOD  A fresh, fried donut with your choice of toppings? Eating a warm donut was better than expected. Kind of like the Krispy Kreme experience ... but with the \"warm\" sign permanently on.  /SERVICE  They could see in our eyes we were n00bs and totally friendly about it.  HOW TO READ MY REVIEWS: 1 Star - Does not approach edible. Enter at your own risk. 2 Stars - If I'm in the area, I'd pick something else. 3 Stars - I would stop by if I happen to be in the area. 4 Stars - I would pick this place out of other places nearby. 5 Stars - I would go out of my way to dine here."}
{"text":"Dear Desert Donuts,  Seriously..Maple Bacon Donut?!?! Amazing!  Sincerely,  A New Yorker who happened to visit this place considered heaven on earth and hopes one day you open a location here.  -Donuts were freshly made, this place was packed and bustling (for obvious reasons). These were the best donuts I've ever had."}
