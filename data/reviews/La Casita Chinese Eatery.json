{"text":"Uninspired.  Other places nearby are MUCH better.  If it wasn't in chinatown I'd rate it higher but with this area it isn't worth trying a 2nd time."}
{"text":"Clueless of where to eat once we arrived in Chinatown -- no service to Yelp :( . I asked locals of where I could find the nearest yet best shu mai after dim sum hours. Couple feet away Ia casita was told to have shu mai and other dim sum plates if asked and was well priced for those on a budget. Waiter/ hostess gave me a sheet of paper and crossed out an area that was only for morning to noon dim sum.   Place was well kept. Staff very friendly. Free wifi! They're dinner deals were unexpectedly cheap basing on our Chinatown in NYC. Dinner for 3 included: 3 hot soups, spring rolls, steamed vegetables, general tso chicken, chicken friend rice for a little under $24! I really came to Chinatown in search of some good shu mai.. Assuming that was my first question when arriving as well as ordering I would get that first.. I actually got it last better yet in a to-go box. I think they even forgot. I mentioned it after our big dinner and they offered complimentary dessert. Don't remember the name but it was a warm sweet bean soup, with tapioca. Eventually I got my shu mai to go. Food was cooked perfect! Not your local greasy Chinese restaurants.. Just wished I got what I ordered when I was craving it."}
{"text":"The one star review is given only based on extremely rude service, the food was nothing spectacular but passable.    We were not very hungry at the time, and only wanted some noodle soup that was advertised on the billboard in front of the restaurant.  However, they refused to serve noodle soup outside of lunch hours.  Having already sat down, we decided to order something anyway, getting an order of fried noodles to share between the two of us.  The waitress seemed extremely annoyed and showed much contempt.  While we were eating, another couple got seated next to us and was also given a hard time ordering.  The waitress even openly criticized them for ordering too little.  The worst part came when I was paying the bill.  Having already been annoyed by the rude service, I only left a couple of quarters as tip.  A woman who looked to be the owner came to the table and demanded that I tip at least 10%.  I was outraged and took back the tip and left with a horrible aftertaste in my mouth.  If you want an order of rude service alongside your noodles, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Have been here about 6 times already - one of our favorite places in Chinatown.  After patronizing Lee Garden, Xam Yu, and New SKy (all good choices), have gradually switched over here.  Clean, good service, good food, have not been disappointed.  The place is becoming very popular - at the last visit, there was hardly a table available."}
{"text":"So sad my experience! I went there, ate lemon chicken, not spectacular and when I was trying to pay, the machine never connected with the bank and I couldn't pay in that way! I offer myself to go to the bank to get cash but the woman in the cashier start to yelling, really rude her manners.. They send me a waiter to go with me to the bank with the order of don't give the change (3.20 including tip of 13%) until he receive the money from me. Really very upset and offended with all the treat received from that women. I'll never come back to La Casita :("}
{"text":"This is my new go-to restaurant in Chinatown.  I've been here twice during my 2-week vacation, once for lunch and once for dinner.  It's a nice setting, with table cloths instead of plastic sheets.  The food both times were delicious and the price reasonable.  The service was outstanding by the lady owner and her youthful son, but i think i know the waitress which some of the negative reviewers commented about.  She has a grouchy face, so just ask the boss lady or her son for service.  We had many dishes here, but i recommend the soup base pea sprouts, salt and spicy prawns, the steamed fish and the ginger onion lobster.  I really hope this place survives so that i can visit it the next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars but I will round up because we were expecting to pay more but were pleasantly surprised.    Dimsum was $2.30 per dish, small, medium and large.  Amazing value for pretty decent dishes.  The service was quite good too.  I would go back if I needed a dimsum fix."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge dim sum person but I enjoyed the veggie and chow mein dish I had. My friends enjoyed their dim sum very muchly!! Nice and clean restaurant."}
{"text":"Friends introduced us to this new restaurant in Spadina Chinatown.  Very easy to miss, as have walked by several times without noticing it before.  We had their dim sum menu which was good value, but their regular menu looks tempting too.  Very good first impressions.  The place is clean and comfortable.  We definitely will return to try out more of their menu or dim sum again."}
{"text":"Yet another brand new dim sum joint in Chinatown.  Not complaining though.  But there is already a lot of competition to go around.    3 stars as quality is pretty good, comfortable environment albeit with a limited dim sum menu. Being just recently opened, everything looks clean and new.  Was there at 11am on a Thursday and we were the only customers there at the time so service was spectacular.   With nice instrumental Chinese music in the background, our dim sum came fairly quickly one after the other.  Their menu though, is rather limited with 44 items.   Some standard dim sum items are missing such as egg tarts, tofu flower (silky tofu with syrup), beef rice rolls.  However there are some unique items such chicken feet with taro and siu mai with a twist - scallop instead of shrimp.  Both are flavourful and delicious though I did not taste much taro flavour in the chicken feet.  Another unique item are the veal ribs.   If you like popcorn chicken, the kind that you can find on the menu at tea shops, they have that under 'deep fried chicken'.    3 items for dessert - Mango pudding, sticky rice pastries and tapioca pudding.   Tried the tapioca pudding and they were about the same as the ones offered at Rosewood with a custard filling with a mild sweetness.  Tapioca was a bit chewy though.  $2.30 for S/M/L and $3.95 for XL dishes and it's supposed to be all day Mon - Sun.   It's worth a try."}
{"text":"Must try: pork hot pot. This was delicious. Pork was cooked to perfection  Also good: Satay beef rice noodles, soy chicken.  The food is good and very reasonably priced. The style of food is reminiscent of House of Gourmet.  They have some mild safety inspection issues on their Dinesafe history"}
{"text":"3.5/5, +.5 for service  It seems we have polarizing views in terms of service, yet agree somewhat that the food is decent. I guess I came on a good day, cause I found service here to be very good.  I came here from a tip from one of my relatives about this restaurant, whose manager used to work at Lee Garden! Their chefs are apparently from Mississauga and Scarborough, so yeah they do travel quite a bit to get here.  In terms of the food, it was mostly good with a few misses. I liked the curry cuttlefish with the fact they're small but still tasty, also the siu mai was quite good despite the fact they're quite big. The veggie dumplings (we ordered two kinds) were decent according to my grandma. However, the beef noodle roll disappointed me, as the noodle roll had absolutely no taste at all. We also ordered a mixed mushroom fried noodle, which tasted standard.  This place definitely shines in terms of cleanliness though, one of the cleanest restaurants I've been to in Chinatown. Apparently they got a four-star rating in terms of that according to the manager."}
{"text":"I came here for a family reunion on a Tuesday evening for dinner. The place was not very busy at all - I would guess 3 or 4 other tables throughout the evening - and yet they CRAMMED all 15 of us in one table.  We were elbow to elbow, knee to knee, and on more than one occasion was the near giver and receiver of neighbouring chopsticks to the eye.  It was also hot as hell in there. buckets of sweat were released, including the sweaty servers and likely sweaty kitchen staff. It would explain why the food was on the salty side. Eewwww. They also brought food out way too fast. Yes, it's a first world problem, but the plates were being stacked on top of one another, and the spinning wheel at the centre of the table couldn't spin because the food was too heavy and the plates overflowing from the wheel would crash into teapots, teacups, glasses, and other safety hazards. Buckets of sweat, flying chopsticks, and salty food aside, it was nice being around family that I don't get to see too often and thus left feeling somewhat satisfied. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, but definitely would give it another shot if in good company."}
