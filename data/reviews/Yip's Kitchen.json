{"text":"Best price for value compared to anything in this general st. Lawrence market area. I go to school around here and have tried almost every single food place there is in this general area and I always find myself going back to yips.   Not only are the staff kind (esp the young man who normally cashes you out) but the food is absolutely amazing considering the price. They have a lot of vege/seafood options. My go to is the flat noodles with two servings of fish (approx $8)"}
{"text":"This place is located in the lower level of the St Lawrence Market, just around the corner from the West side lower entrance.  Essentially you pay $5.75 for your choice of noodle or rice, and then you get to pick an item to have put on top. For an extra dollar or so you can get a second item as well. I almost always went with the General Chao Chicken (yes, you read that right... Chao) on a thick vermicelli noodle, although the Spicy Chicken w/ Vegetable, Chilli Chicken, and BBQ Pork were good for variety too. If you're vegetarian, fear not as they have grilled eggplant, tofu, and a couple other options. The spring rolls, dumplings, and chicken wings were all nice add ons as well. The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because sometimes they run out of certain dishes and it can be a bit of a let down to be stuck with a lesser impressive noodle (the shanghai noodle comes to mind).  This is the probably where my love for cheap chinese food lunches comes from. When I worked in the area I'd come down here at least once a week to take advantage of their wicked deals. After a couple years of eating this every week, I've been on a mission to find something that fills the void in my new working grounds. While I've found cheap chinese lunches, nothing has been as good as Yip's was. Hopefully I'll have time on a weekend to stop by again for some lunch, because I miss this place."}
{"text":"My family and I were walking through the St.Lawrence market and were enticed by the selection and visuals of cantonese noodles, bbq pork, beef and green beans and so much more. We got a little bit of almost everything and for a great price. Would definitely eat here again. Staff is also very friendly."}
{"text":"Last fall my Mom brought me to Yip's Kitchen for the first time ever - since then I have been hooked. I am obsessed with their noodles, tofu and eggplant. This is hands down my favourite Chinese food Downtown, Toronto and trust me, I have tried A LOT of Chinese food down here."}
{"text":"Yip's Kitchen has amazing prices for the value that they offer. Around the weekend, they have a plate of 5 shumai for $2.75 each (wow!!) and they're HUGE. They also have a great combo meal that's under $10 so I can see why a lot of my classmates love this place. I totally recommend getting the shumai with chili oil."}
{"text":"Best Chinese takeout place in the area! Then again, there are no other Chinese take out places around. Considering it's located in St. Lawrence Market, the food is cheap and good and even better than what you would find in a mall food court. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"From my one experience, Yip's, I have decided that Canadian Chinese food is odd. The shu mai had peas and carrots! The pork buns had an unusual exterior consistency and inside were almost jammy. And the fried chicken was extra greasy. Nice people, quick service - but the food was just not that good."}
{"text":"Last lunch I had was pretty gross. May not return. Chicken was odd. Entire meal was so greasy."}
{"text":"My review is based on their breakfast/dim sum options only.   With being away from Toronto for the summer, I was craving chinese food on a visit but didn't want to go far from home. With St. Lawrence being a walkable distance, I decided on Yip's Kitchen after reading reviews on yelp about how their dim sum options were inexpensive. Close to home and cheap? Always down.  Once there, I didn't see an option of $2.75 for 5 dim sum. They didn't have much option either. Altogether, I could probably count around 7 plates you could choose from. Still, I decided to give it a try since I was there. I ordered a plate of Ha Gau shrimp dumplings for 3.99 that came with 4 small sized dumplings.  I also ordered two individual Lotus Leaf Sticky Rice for $2.50 each which were also very small. The amount of rice given per leaf was the size of half my fist.   My order came up to around 10$ with tax and it was nowhere near enough for my boyfriend and I for breakfast. We ended up grabbing some pastries nearby.   Overall, I'm pretty sure I won't be coming back for dim sum. If I'm around later in the day, I wouldn't mind trying their other options but unfortunately, their dim sum was a disappointment for me. But I'm glad to say that I tried it!"}
