{"text":"Sushi Review Only. It was completely by chance we found this place on a Saturday that our first pick sushi restaurant happened to be closed and was looking in Yelp for another Sushi place nearby. This place at first didn't appeal to me knowing it was located in a food court but we took a chance because it was open and near by.   I have to say it was the best choice for sushi and thank goodness our 1st pick place was closed.  First, it's located in the below ground food court/shops where Marshalls is located. It seems to be a relatively new building with 85% of shop space unoccupied ghost town-like without tenants. Tucked in a corner, the place is run by a very friendly Korean couple that serves truly amazing sushi. They take pride and care in making and presenting the food. Of all the over priced sushi places around the GTA, this by far takes the best taste to price award for Dragon rolls. We ordered the Red Dragon Roll and Small (30 pcs)Sushi Platter. The quality, quantity and taste equals any of the best sushi I ever had at drastically more costly restaurants.   The sushi rice was made at perfect temperature with excellent texture, moisture , taste and stickiness. The fish was very fresh with a nice large thick cut-no skimping. I give it a 4 instead of 5 stars is because although the Sushi Platter tasted amazing, there were too few pieces of actual \"fish\" sushi.  By far their best deal are the dragon rolls which I will order a bunch instead of sushi In the future. Now on whenever going to downtown to fix a sushi crave, This is my go to place."}
{"text":"I love this place! The people who work here are so friendly and kind, as well.   I tried the sushi, and also the combo (I was hungry ok).  I had the bulgolgi, spicy fried chicken, and I forget the rest. But it was all so good. and it's fresh.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Beef Bibimbap had the right amount of marinated vegs and bulgogi beef and if you eat in the small concourse-level food court the owner brings over the food in a corningware bowl with metal spoon - just like how you would eat at home.  The taste is authentic with the right amount of sweet Korean hot sauce and a fried egg on top - needless to say, I would definitely recommend this place if you're craving Bibimbap."}
{"text":"Came for lunch with some work friends on a friday. Always saw this place when having lunch at Kaiju but never bothered to order there. While their name is Sushi & BBbop it appears the BBbop should not be part of the name. I am by no means an expert but this bibimbap did not impress. The meat was ground and sparse, which is somewhat understandable for the price but nothing about the dish stood out. Friends had sushi which looked nice for the price but none marked it as very remarkable.  I would come back to try one of their meat combos, which look like they are quite generous serving sizes and quite tasty."}
{"text":"I ordered pork bone soup and it was mediocore with no side dishes that usual Korean restaurants provide before the meals. I understand that this is only food court food, but that should be reflected in its price too. The cost is the same if not more than other Korean restaurants."}
{"text":"Came to this spot to try out a nearby restaurant, but happened upon this place. We always eat at Koreantown near Bloor and Bathurst and this bibimbap is so much better than what you get there ! All the individual components of the bibimbap are top-notch stuff, would highly recommend. It's hard to discover a real hidden gem these days, and if you eat in, the owner will serve you. (Fast food with great service). Have had the beef bibimbap the last couple of times, aiming to try the pork bone soup one of these days."}
{"text":"Authentic and super delicious korean food! My friends and I live nearby and we all love this shop. Pork bone soup and rice cake are my personal favs. The owners are the nicest people youll meet. Highly recommend for anyone craves korean and happens to be the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Fantastic food (coming from a family of Koreans) and great service. I'll definitely be going again."}
{"text":"I live in the Auro building and am a return customer of this restaurant. My gf and I both really enjoy the Sushi here. Their dragon rolls are incredible. Price is right and they make everything super quick. I've also tried the pork bone soup and really enjoyed it... need to try the Korean food still.  The owner doesn't give enough soya sauce though.. so ask for more"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Korean food place in downtown. Good quality food for cheap price. I tried most of the menu but my favourite is their donkatsu. Soonduboo is good as well. The store is pretty hidden. But if you do pass by this Aura building, try their food at the food court!"}
{"text":"Went down for lunch today and got their Beef Bibimbap. The food was delicious, the ingredients tasted fresh, and the portion was filling. The lady who served me was really nice too."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good for a food court place, especially for takeout. I come here regularly for a beef bibimbap."}
{"text":"I live at the Aura building and it was my first time to visit the foodcourt. Found this place and ordered some food. Delicious!! I ordered bibimbop, ddukboki and donkatsu. I never had experienced food at this quality at a foodcourt.  Owner is friendly and food is amazing. What other compliment do you need for a restaurant?  Truly hidden gem. So glad to find this place. Love the fact that I just have to take elevator down to visit this place."}
{"text":"I was in the area and wanted Korean food. So Google led me to Sushi & BBbop at the Shops at Aura food court. When I first got there, I almost turned around because I didn't realize what a ghost town the Shops at Aura was and didn't think there could possibly be good food in such a deserted environment. I am so glad I decided to give it a chance. Loved the kimchi fried rice! And it was quite relaxing to be able to eat lunch in a quiet atmosphere without so much hustle and bustle around."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi place in town. it's a shame if you live in Aura condo but you haven't tried it yet."}
{"text":"Awesome place to grab food in dowtown!!! Personally one of my favorite places to grab Korean food and sushi and save a trip going to korean town when I am in downtown! I've tried almost all of their food and it's not hit and miss... whatever you order you cannot go wrong And plus the owners their are super friendly and loving to all customers Definitely check it out if you are in the area"}
{"text":"Service: - quick and friendly service  - this was unexpected as they deliver to your seats even though it was in a food court   Food: - ordered the novelty kimchi fries  - fries were yellow, crispy and crunchy - kimchi and other toppings including the beef reminds you of poutine  - fusion between fries and kimchi would have seemed to be odd at first, but it turns out to be tasty   - next time, would want to try out their other stuff on the menu   Overall: - located in an underground food court: what can you really expect other than the fact that they were nice enough to deliver the food (can't ask for more, can we)  - ambient and quiet since the rest of the food court seems to be kinda empty"}
{"text":"I can confidently say that this is the best Korean restaurant in Toronto. Hidden away in the reclusive food court, this unassuming place offers authentic home-cooked meals prepared by a sweet Korean couple.   I come here at least once a week. All the selections on the menu are reliably good, but I particularly recommend the raw vegetable & nut bibimbop, the pork bone soup, and their combos. You can always trust this place to satisfy your craving for Korean food."}
{"text":"You can find authentic Korean food here.  Try Row vegi & nut bibimbop and Kimchi fried rice."}
{"text":"PLEASE EAT HERE!!!  If it wasn't for Yelp, I would never have guessed that this place existed. It's located in the \"food court\" of a \"mall\" that's literally dead - windows barred and everything. Plus, it's on the lower floor so I feel like no one comes here by chance, ever. Which is extremely unfortunate because the food is very, very good. I've only ever had the bibimbop section of the menu, but was quite impressed. Plus, it's packed with veggies and brown rice and seems pretty healthy to boot! Portions are also awesome for the price and is definitely filling.   The woman (I think this is a family restaurant) serving me was so nice. When I walked up I was welcomed immediately. She also took the time to introduce each of the sauces (get the traditional one and combine it with hot sauce for the best effect) and some of the ingredients to me. Given that this is a fast food place in the middle of downtown, I don't think I can stress how rare this sort of experience is.  Really really hope they get more traffic! I know I will be back for sure. It's literally a 5 minute walk from Eaton - skip the food court there and come here, people. :D"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! I ordered jajangmyeon and it was ready in about 10 mins or so. It tasted really good although it could use a little bit more salt as it was kind of lacking that flavour. It only costed me $9.60 after tax  so I ain't complaining   My boyfriend ordered combo A which comes with white rice and 3 sides. He liked it but they give a small portion of rice but it still filled him up anyway. It was $9.50 before tax.   On top of that, the owners are really kind. They are always smiling and happy! Would definitely come again when I am craving this while at school."}
{"text":"At first I was skeptical because it is a little pricey for a food court restaurant but it did not disappoint me with the food. The owners are warm, friendly and clearly very proud of their own sushi. This place definitely deserves more traffic than it's getting right now.   I'd definitely come back for the sushi."}
{"text":"They've got the best kimchi fried rice in town!!! You must try it if you are into Korean dishes. Their tofu soup is also great. Call them 5 minutes before you go and order your food, they will have them ready when you arrive. Their kimchi fries are like no other. So creamy and saucy with the right amount of spice."}
{"text":"A real find, tucked away inside the Aura food court. Frankly, I would never have discovered this place if it weren't for Yelp; the location is so inconspicuous, and there's no signage outside of the condos to indicate the kinds of eateries inside.  Don't let the food court trappings fool you: Sushi & BBbop serves restaurant-quality meals, for very reasonable prices - after taxes, very few of the menu options cost more than $9 or $10. If you're eating in (and there's always plenty of space in the cafeteria), they will even bring your meal out to you. Both the portions and quality are ideal. I've never had to wait longer than 3 minutes for my order to be completed, and I've never been less than completely satisfied or sated. From the pork bone soup to the jajangmyeon - everything is well-made, and far more homestyle than fast food. (Disclaimer: I haven't tried any of the Japanese items. Yet!)  I agree with another reviewer that the lack of banchan and water perhaps compares unfavourably with a full-fledged Korean establishment, but on the other hand, they don't charge gratuities, even though they probably could: the wonderful couple who run Sushi & BBbop are incredibly polite, friendly, and welcoming. And there's virtually no wait time. The combination of the service and quality of a regular restaurant with the convenience, price, and speed of a food court location are hard to beat. Strongly recommended - give them a try!"}
{"text":"I've had the kimchi stew and the raw salmon bibimbap, both of which were delicious.  The Bibimbap was a cup of sticky rice, with a bunch of finely julienned vegetables, like beets, cucumbers, and cabbage.  A handful of chopped salmon and some Korean chili paste, and that was it.  So good!    Kimchi stew was good, but the meat was hit-or-miss - some pieces were tender, others were grisly.  The rest of the stew was delicious.  It's a great place to grab a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Very good and healthy Korean food, the owner is very friendly. I love the raw salmon and veg on rice. Their sushi dishes are pretty good too"}
{"text":"Could improve but not as good as paninos . I had the bibimbap it was really good like really awesome. Everyone else also agreed it was dope that I went with.  So yeah fantastic food but could improve the girl at the desk is really cute too."}
{"text":"Vegetable bibimbop at this place is one of the best bibimbop I have ever had (this is a big statement because I have lived most of my life in Korea). It is very unique in that they put ground nuts and black sesame.. it not just tastes good, but smells so appetizing. Other menus that I love to order are pork bone soup, soft tofu soup, kimchi soup, and 7 piece sushi combo. Especially, pork bone soup at this place is better than Kimchi house (on Dundas) or Sunrise house (on Bloor). The Korean owner couple prepare food just like they do for their family, and anything you try at this place simply cannot go wrong. I frequent this place at least once or twice a week!"}
{"text":"Sushi and BBbop is one of the few occupied spaces in the Shops at Aura food court. I bought a combo here recently and it was great, especially for the price!  I got Combo B which is brown rice and 3 choices. I choose beef bulgogi, fried chicken and vegetable dumplings ($10.50). It was a large portion for the price.   The beef was soft and tender and not overly sinewy. The chicken was lean (not gristly) and lightly battered and had a nice spicy kick to it. I got 5 fried dumplings. They tasted like they had that soy protein/textured vegetable protein/faux ground meat in them. They were ok, but I was expecting real vegetables in them. The rice was a bit soft and mushy, but it was still ok.  The couple working there were super nice.   I think this place is great for  Korean fast food."}
{"text":"This place is the best. I always come here for lunch and dinner. The food is amazing and the price is affordable. The owners are always greeting everyone with a smile and are always welcoming. A very great place to come to! I highly recommend this to everyone in the area."}
{"text":"Rolls have fresh ingredients and are rolled at the spot! However it is pretty pricey for just one roll. I will come back to try the Korean dishes."}
{"text":"My friends and I from work come and enjoy the raw veggie and nut bibimbop at least once a week.  Always fresh and delicious.  Actually we crave it! Friendly and welcoming.  A favorite, quiet lunch spot.  We feel like it's a secret!! But...love it so much I want others to experience it."}
{"text":"First time going to this place for lunch. Tried combo B with spicy pork, deep fried chicken with salad. Spicy pork is pretty tasty but the deep fried chicken is way too hard to get a bite. I still think the price is not reasonable. $10.99 plus taxes and doesn't come with a pop or tea. Don't think I will go back."}
{"text":"Excellent Bimbim bop, Korean combo and Sushi.  Food very well prepared but it takes time when it gets busy during lunch."}
{"text":"This is the third sushi place i have tried since last one week i came here after watching all reveiws on yelp.its worth trying."}
{"text":"I frequent here every few days, and I believe this place deserves a lot of credit and can often be overshadowed by the popular Kaijiu. If you are in the area and have a Korean comfort food hankering this is the place to visit. It offers a great selection including stews, combo plates (pick 3/4/5 items), bibimbap, and sushi options. Although I have never tried the sushi, I can attest the rest will leave you stuffed and satisfied.   At this price point however, I could be getting side dishes and water with my order at any other Korean restaurant, but I'll let this go since this is a food court restaurant after all.   Give this place a try next time you drop by at the Aura food court (if ever)!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, fast and friendly service, and the owners of the shop are the nicest people you'll ever meet!"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while I was waiting for my food at Kaiju, as they're located in the same abandoned Shops at Aura food court.  I was greeted enthusiastically by the middle-aged man who owns the restaurant.  He quickly guided me through the menu and offered suggestions.  I told him I just ordered food from Kaiju but I'd be back.  I kept my promise and returned a few days later with a gamjatang (pork bone soup) craving to satisfy.    I haven't searched too hard, but this is amongst the cheapest gamjatang you can get downtown at $8.50.  The gamjatang itself was of average quality and average quantity - 3 large pieces.  In addition to the cheap gamjatang, the other thing that stood out about this place was the nice old couple running this place.  Much like Kaiju's owners, they seemed like good people just trying to make the most out of the unfortunate location of their business.  One suggestion I have is that they offer free sides.  I feel like this would put the value of the meal over top and would entice more customers.  Give this place a shot - cheap Korean food in the dt core + good service."}
{"text":"The place is great! I love the veggie Bibimbop. It is very healthy and tasty! The owner is also very friendly and I was surprised as to how good the food was."}
{"text":"Since trying this place months ago, I've been back for the tofu soup, pork bone soup and beef bibimbap. All of these dishes have been consistent in taste and quality!  But the best part about this place has to be the service and the nice owners.  Just that alone keeps me coming back.  Anyways please give this place a try if you are in the area. You won't regret it"}
{"text":"This place is good! I ate here for the first time today and I like their meal selection. I got the Combo A with rice plus 3 sides and it was well worth the price I paid because I was so full in the end. Taste like home cooked meal too.   I would definitely come back here again and eat from their other selections. Such nice people who work here too!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time! Delicious food and nice owners. The place is in the spacious and secluded food court."}
{"text":"Hidden & Buried treasure! Amazing little spot in the graveyard that is the Aura basement. Made fresh to order, it does take a bit of time but well worth the wait. $7.99 combo let's you pick 3 sides plus rice or noodles. You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I had Combo A. It comes with rice and 3 sides. I picked rice, bulgogi, spicy fried chicken, and kimchi and the total was $10.15 after tax.   My expectation was high prior due to all the good reviews on Yelp. After trying the food, it was okay, nothing special. I didn't mind the kimchi and spicy fried chicken. Tbh everything was just bland. Therefore a 3 star rating from me.   Also, I don't get how or why kimchi is the same price as 5 dumplings. It doesn't make sense. Since I'm a small eater and not a fan of dumpling, I went with kimchi but it should be free. It shouldn't count towards sides.   Will I go back? Low possibility. I'll stick with my regular visit at Kaiju and order Tori Karaage and it would still be cheaper."}
{"text":"Run down food court with poor ventilation. The only positive thing is the portion size of the black dragon roll that I ordered. Otherwise, the sushi fell apart and the rice was dry and not cooked enough. Avocados were not ripe either. It wasn't that cheap at 12$ a roll for a food court as well.   Such a disappointment for the high reviews on Yelp!"}
{"text":"Had a craving for some korean but wanted it fast. Saw this on yelp and since it's close to work dropped by.  I had the combo C with:  Glass noodles: pretty good, I enjoy the glass noodles, there's mushrooms in it too  Chicken dumplings: not bad, its good for fast food.  Spicy fried chicken: this was pretty good, a little spicy but won't make you sweat.  Kim chee: it's not bad but I probably would try the salad or another meat  Overall, pretty good for fast food and service was fast and courteous. I'll be back to try the bulgogi."}
{"text":"Always tasty food (both sushi and Korean) at very reasonable prices. It looks like a mom and pop shop and they're always very kind."}
{"text":"I liked what I got which was pork bone soup. It was tasty, and the portion was generous.  Why I gave it 4 stars: It took way too long for them to get my soup ready. It took 20+ minutes which is usually longer than a restaurant would take to make a meal.  I was the only person who sat in that food court, I received no free wifi or even phone signals. The ambient is dull if you decided to eat there alone.   In general, I would go back to eat again with a friend ( seems like the owners are very nice and they need support because barely any people know about this food court)."}
{"text":"Good fresh cheap sushi and bibimbop. The owners are very friendly and super accommodating."}
{"text":"Sushi & Bbbop is a hidden gem - I'd never expect to find food this tasty located in a food court. It's run by a very friendly Korean couple with a decent amount of selections. My absolute favourites include their spicy fried chicken and stir fried pork from their combo korean dish, and don katsu. I heard they make really good sushi too, hoping to try it out after I get sick of my usuals. (If that ever happens)"}
{"text":"I've tried most of the meals of this place and it was really delicious and the wife and husband who own the restaurant greet you enthusiastically quickly guided me through the menu, and offered suggestions, also give awesome service. Also they help me out with Korean homework sometimes.  One suggestion I have is that they offer free sides.  I feel like this would put the value of the meal over top and would entice more customers.  Another suggestion i have to offer is that they should update their music video playlist to pull in new customers.   I had the black bean noodles, spicy rice cakes, raw vegi, beef, chicken bimbibop ramen, sushi  Overall I love the food, the awesome service and they made me feel so welcomed."}
{"text":"Great find.  Enjoyed both the Korean and Japanese fair.  The beef Bimimbap was flavourful and better than I have ever had in Winnipeg.  The owner recommended to have the veggie dumplings deep fried (can also have them steamed) they were small but packed with flavour.  Not sure I would order these again.  The tempura was good with two large shrimp but the star was the green dragon.  Highly recommend this sushi dish.  Will return next time in TO"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this place. Very nice owners and as a korean person, i found it to be a very authentic korean food. I have never had their japanese options but I really recommend the rice cake (ttokbokgi), pork bone soup, and kimbap (korean styled sushi). I recommend this to anyone wanting good korean food in toronto."}
{"text":"Such a simple looking place in a food court, but a fabulous restaurant. Glad to have run into it! Had their beef bibimbap and jyajyeong-min (black noodles) and was pleasantly surprised by authenticity of this taste. Beautiful Korean restaurant right in our neighborhood. Apart from the Japanese curry house, Kaiju, this is one of the better Asian restaurants in the Yonge/College area. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great, very authentic Korean food at bargin prices. With no sacrifice on quality or taste. Took the whole family and my teenage girls loved it. Even my wife liked it and she hates any 'foreign' food."}
{"text":"Sushi & BBbop is located inside the Aura foodcourt - that is an underground mall under the Aura supercondo where the only entrances into the underground mall are super non-descript. Nevertheless, if you're connected to the \"PATH\" (eg. College Park 1, 2,777 Bay, College Park Suites, College subway station) that means you can get here entirely indoors while wearing flipflops and tshirts in the middle of winter.  When I saw jajangmyeon on the menu, I knew that was what I was getting. For $8.50+HST, it's a filling meal of noodles topped with a fried egg. It's not salty and it doesn't have MSG that would leave a dry taste in your mouth. It's just good and done right.  If you stare at the menu, the owner will come out and recommend the Combo A, B or C to you. I'd still go with the jajangmyeon everytime but somehow it feels very un-foodcourt-like for people to approach and tell you about their menu. Is it because we're in Aura's dead/dying mall? Or maybe it's because their family-owned business business depends on them trying harder than a typical chain fast food employees.  And once you do order, grab a seat! They'll serve it straight to your table.  Wifi password is 4166077227"}
{"text":"Hidden in the Aura building basement is this gem of Korean restaurant. After having several of their Korean dishes, I found their dishes not only to be delicious but also hearty. To further enhance the experience, the couple running the restaurant are very friendly and accommodating. If you ever get the chance, it is definitely a great place to try."}
{"text":"Great Korean food. Service here is excellent and, for the price and location, is one of the best Korean take-out places in the downtown core. Usually get the raw salmon and veggie bibimbap."}
{"text":"My absolutely favorite place to eat dynamite roll and pork bone soup! The couple is so friendly and nice every time I visit. I genuinely recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Great taste! Go for the chapchae(glass noodle) with stir fry pork combo and other sides. Kimchi stew is also recommended for those who take the spiciness!"}
{"text":"Really welcoming and accommodating owners! The food is great.  I'm practically always here.  If you're a fan of Korean food or Asian food in particular, this would really appeal to you.  They season their food really well and typically give you quite huge portions if you eat in the food court. (I usually take it to go)  They have a huge variety to their menu so you can't go wrong. :)"}
{"text":"A gem of a place. Very friendly and accommodating staff. Great food always made fresh. It sucks that they don't get more business due to its obscure location - they deserve better!"}
{"text":"Seriously, COME EAT HERE. Make the trip into this somewhat forgotten space in this busy city and come eat here.  It's cafeteria food pricing, but every dish I've tried here so far has been on par with any other ramen, or sushi or bibimbop restaurant.   it's a good court, so kinda an odd space, but they will serve you at your seat."}
{"text":"Excellent Korean food, I love the combo with chapchae noodles which for those who have not had them before, are chewy.  The dumplings were crispy and the filling nicely seasoned, the spicy chicken was addictive and the stir fried pork went perfectly with the chapchae.  The tempura appetizer was the best of the Japanese items we tried, but the sushi and katsu were decent too.  The best part of the katsu is the house made sauce.  Living in the area, I'm glad when I find new places to pick up a quick, quality take out dinner.  Call ahead and have your take out order ready and waiting for you!"}
{"text":"I asked the people there which sushi rolls they recommend and they said that the dynamite and the salmon and tuna with avocado rolls were good so I chose the latter. It was pretty pricey for 1 roll, which was about $9 for 8 pieces. Maybe it's a standard price but I'm used to AYCE prices. They bring the food straight to where you're sitting and that's a first for me. The sushi was amazing, I enjoyed it but I don't think I'd come back to get the same roll because of the price but maybe something else."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken katsu and the chicken is soooo not crispy.  The curry sauce is spicy and sour,  unlike those japanese curry sauce which is supposed to be sweet :("}
{"text":"Came for lunch and ordered Combo A (beef bulgogi, spicy fried chicken, 5 pcs. dumpling) for $9.00  In general, the food is quite decent and a little bit dry. It might not be the best, but it serves good portion and price for lunch. I would give 3 stars for the food overall.   Very good service. The owners are the kindest people I've met. They are too nice. I'm giving 5 stars for the service. The food might not be the main thing that I would come back for but I totally come back to see these two people.   Regarding menu, they offer variety of Japanese sushi/maki and Korean foods (rice, soup, noodle) at a reasonable price.  I totally recommend this place if you need some quick, filling Korean foods at a cheap price."}
{"text":"The owners here are so sweet and friendly! The food here is cheap, quick and so good! The bulgogi+japchae combo is totally worth it- its like, $10 for 6 pieces of mandoo, kimchi and a lot of bulgogi and clear noodles. Their kimchi fried rice is also really tasty."}
{"text":"This food court restaurant is so much better than it has a right to be! While visiting the city recently, my husband and I stopped in at two different times and had two great experiences. The first time I got the raw veggie and nut bibimbap with house made hot sauce and he got the salmon sushi combo. My portion allowed me to savor the delicious combination of flavors for two meals! On the second visit, I got a rainbow roll and a salmon avocado roll and he got the raw veggie bibimbap.  The owners/chefs appear to be family, which adds a nice mom & pop appeal. They were very sweet and friendly. All of the ingredients were fresh and the prices were reasonable. If I lived in the building above this food court I may never leave."}
{"text":"Totally hidden, but does Korean food great!  The food court was pretty much empty when me and my friends went to eat, but that's a given for about 4 pm on a Tuesday. Between us we ordered the chicken bibimbap, beef bibimbap and the bulgogi plate with purple rice, with a side of vegetable dumplings and spicy chicken.  For the price, it's quite worth it, but the location is kind of unfortunate. The food was great and pretty well sized for about $8 a piece. Food came very promptly and we were given the bottle of gochujang (hot pepper sauce) on the side by the kind woman who was working the counter when we arrived. Great place to check out if you're just looking for quick good K-food near the Eaton centre downtown!"}
{"text":"I would've never known about this place had it not been for Yelp. Located in the quiet, kinda creepy and seemingly abandoned food court underneath the Aura condos, Sushi & BBbop is run by a very nice couple who really cares about their customers and food. I ordered combo C (chapchae + three sides) with beef bulgogi, spicy fried chicken and dumplings. They were quite generous with the portions, especially for the price ($10.50 + tax). It's definitely more than I can eat for one meal! I didn't think I'd like the spicy fried chicken when I first saw it...pieces of fried chicken smothered in some kind of sauce that looks like General Tso's aka icky westernized Chinese takeout! But I digress. I actually really enjoyed it! Beef bulgogi and dumplings were quite good too. The chapchae was a little bland though. This is a great spot for lunch, and I will definitely be returning to try their bibimbap and stews!"}
{"text":"A friendly husband and wife make fresh and tasty bbimbbap, pork bone soup, and other standard Korean dishes.  Friendly, fast and reasonably priced. Always enjoy coming here!"}
{"text":"Sushi & BBbop is an excellent restaurant to have a delicious and home-made healthy meal! I'm really glad to have discovered it by chance and will surely return there and highly recommend! It is owned by a lovely Corean couple, who still care about quality and service. Yes I called this little shop in a food court \"restaurant\" on purpose, because the food is restaurant quality/level. And I called it \"home-made\", because it is made by the lady as she would make it at home. It is located in a half-empty food court at the bottom of the Aura condos and shops building, simple and quiet place to sit and have a great meal. Had the chance to try the raw veggy bibimbop with brown rice and spicy sauce, and the pumpkin soup - mmmm. Both excellent! Try it for yourself, and enjoy!"}
