{"text":"I've only been here once and I might go back, but only because I haven't found a better diner in the general vicinity, yet.

Our waitress was friendly as was the man that handled our check when we were paying and taking off. Coffee and water glasses were refilled promptly. No complaints with service. 

The place could use a coat of paint and the furniture leaves much to be desired, but nothing seemed dirty. Maybe the menus, but menus are often a little sticky.  

I ordered two pancakes and two eggs (that combo is a menu item) and a side of hash browns. My dining companion ordered two eggs, hash browns, and toast. We both ordered our eggs over-easy. The pancakes came out a little before everything else, which didn't bother me at all as they're all I really wanted anyway. Pancakes were okay. Not great, but not bad, just not as thick and fluffy as I would have liked. 

When the rest of the food came out I thought it was a little weird that my eggs & hash browns were on a salad plate. I was also very sad to see that the hash browns looked like boring little potato pucks that likely came out of a freezer. They tasted that way too, only with more grease than your average puck/hash brown/whatever. 

The food isn't great, the prices aren't either, and the place is a bit run-down. The staff was nice enough to make me want to give 'em another shot. Not anytime soon though: I'll need some time to get the image of those runny eggs on a salad plate out of my head."}
{"text":"I have had brunch here a couple times. The experience is very nice: it feels cozy and you can get the feeling of living in a \"neighborhood\". The only thing I dislike about this place is pricing. I feel like breakfast's raw ingredient is not expensive and neither making them is hard, so the total price should be less comparing to dinner or lunch, but Kristopher's is kinda expensive compared to other breakfast places."}
{"text":"This place totally rules; I only wish I'd realized it was here earlier. It's a true-blue diner, with greasy-delicious omelets and hash-browns, and a sweet gyro broiler. The portions are massive and cheap, and the coffee is fresh. I'd recommend sitting at the counter, because the chit-chat from the ladies who work there is always entertaining. The service is very quick, but I never feel rushed when I go there. 

Verdict: while you can also buy lottery tickets at the front register, if you're eating at Kristopher's, I'd say you've already won."}
{"text":"This place is a pretty standard greasy-spoon. The staff is nice, the prices are reasonable; it's my local neighborhood diner! You'll find about 20 or so folks in here regularly on a weekend morning. It's got that good community vibe, but it's nothing fancy."}
{"text":"My husband Rick had heard great things about Kristopher's Place for the longest so he suggested we come here for breakfast.  Believe me folks, I was in the mood for a great breakfast.  Thing is I'd just gotten over a stomach virus.  And you've gotta remember, as soon as Susan recuperates from a digestive ailment, she wants to chow!

So I went for breakfast special #2:  two eggs (I had mine fried), home fries, two pieces of sausage, and two pancakes.   Mmmmm!  Pancakes!  Pump that insulin, Susan!  Pump!  I washed all that down with a couple of cups of terrific coffee.  And yes I was a member of the clean plate club.

Kristophers has all the ambiance of an old-time corner diner, but in a good way.  It's a place where the neighborhood oldtimers come to discuss sports or the news over a cup of coffee.  I lived in Greenfield for a few years and I'm surprised I never ate here, despite it being next door to Vocelli Pizza and across from Giant Eagle.  If you want a good ol'fashioned meal, come here."}
{"text":"Stay away!
Rude service!!
The food was decent, but the service was terrible. The server made it pretty clear she'd rather smoke and talk with her grandmother's friends than wait on customers. When I foolishly gave her a 20%, tip, she just gave me a dirty look. 
Yea... Skip this place. If you do go and get this girl (you'll know who I'm talking about as soon as she throws down your menu and rushes away from the table) DON'T TIP HER! 
Unless the tip is to get into a new career far away from customer service."}
{"text":"This is our favorite place for brunch! The food is very delicious. I love breakfast special #2! It feels like at grandma's home:))))"}
{"text":"Places like this is what makes Pittsburgh awesome. Like another reviewer mentioned, it truly feels like you're part of the neighborhood being here. They have their regulars, & I Iove how tight everyone was. This definitely didn't mean that my service was slacked upon. Service was fast, efficient, & friendly. My coffee cup was never empty, and the coffee was fresh the whole time. 
I ordered a breakfast sandwich on a bagel with sausage and egg. Super yummy!  The bagel was fresh, sausage scrumptious (and the perfect amount of greasy). Egg was a fresh egg and not some liquid egg crap. 
The bill was cheap too. $6 for the sandwich and coffee. Love that!
Now I will be honest that place is showing it's age a bit, & could use a little love. That being said, I find that it adds character. It was clean and you can tell they take pride in their establishment. 
If your looking for a good diner breakfast this is a great spot."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a solid breakfast with a lot of options and a good price, Kristopher's Place is the way to go.  My PIC (Partner In Cuisine) and I always try to patronize local eateries as opposed to the big corporate chains so while we driving around today, looking for a place to brunch, I saw Kristopher's (and luckily an open parking spot).

When we first stepped in, the place kind of smelled like dirty water and we stood there for a good minute or two without being acknowledged by any of the 4-5 staff that was working.  We finally asked one of the servers if we could just sit anywhere, to which she replied, \"yeah\" and left us to sit.  

When the server came over, she wasn't particularly friendly, but she took our order quickly.  I sort of felt like we were putting her out by wanting to order food from her restaurant.  As we were waiting for our food to come out, a few older and very loud mouth \"regulars\" popped in.  Their greetings with the other locals seemed to be heading in an anti-Semitic direction (yelling loudly, \"Who let the Jew-boy in?\" to another patron). This made PIC and I initially uncomfortable, thinking we had stumbled onto a Jewish / Greek feud.  Luckily, the conversation dissipated and they continued to talk loudly about other topics.  Unfortunately, they were still pretty obnoxious.

We got our food and I can't tell if the server conveniently forgot the juice that was supposed to come with my meal, but when I inquired about it, I once again felt like I was inconveniencing her.  Every \"thank you\" from PIC and I was met with complete silence.  I got one coffee refill and PIC never got a water refill.  

The food itself wasn't bad, but nothing really stuck out about it either.  It's kind of hard to mess up bacon, eggs, and pancakes though.

Perhaps the staff at Kristopher's was having a bad day or perhaps they just don't like \"new\" people coming into their restaurant.  I'd give it one more go another day just to see if it was a one-time thing or if it's the policy of the staff to be unfriendly to new patrons.  If a restaurant only wants to cater to and be friendly with its regulars, that's their prerogative I suppose, but you'd think in this economy, restaurants cant afford to alienate any of their potential new customer base."}
{"text":"Nope. I do not agree with other reviewers. We will not go back here. Psssst... there's no wait because it sucks!

The staff is totally rude, and they only care about their regulars. No refills, no smiles, forgotten items.... I felt like I had to apologize for *bothering* to order my food.

The place is dirty, run down, and downright uncomfortable. I felt like I was eating in my junior high cafeteria.

If super cheap and massive portions is your only criteria? For $7.99/person (or $8.99 on Sundays) my husband and I can eat as much as we want at the Eat & Park weekend buffet, and my daughter (until she turns 6) can join us for free. 
For about $4 more dollars, the three of us can get our usuals at Pamela's."}
{"text":"Basic but friendly place to grab a cup of coffee while waiting for your car to be serviced at Homer's.  I would probably choose to dine elsewhere under any other circumstances.  To be be fair though, I didn't try any of their food.  Coffee was decent and the service was friendly but also left me alone to study."}
{"text":"My husband I went to Eat n Park and stood around for about twenty minutes waiting to be seated. The hostess and staff seemed completely indifferent to the growing # of people in the doorway. So.. we left and found ourselves at Kristopher's Place. 

The restaurant is not pretty but who cares? We were immediately greeted and there was a open table with no wait! Within minutes were had drinks and placed our orders. The food was cooked fresh and  tasted great. It was just as its advertised... a good family style restaurant."}
