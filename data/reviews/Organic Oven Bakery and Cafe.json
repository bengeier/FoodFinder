{"text":"Organic oven was one of the first, more established backed goods company that sells to other stores. When there wasn't very much variety, their products were better than others. I will say, I only like certain products. I love their lemon loaf. Some other products are still too crumbly/heavy. But above average than other \"fresh\" products out there (a lot of gluten free breads etc. are frozen, or stores sell them frozen).   I like how they have an independent cafe, where you can actually get a meal as well -  AND a baked good.   My real big con is this place is closed on Saturday!!! I don't live near here, and think it's rather ridiculous not to be opened on the \"shopping day\" for most people."}
{"text":"Honestly, thank goodness I moved out of this hood a month before Organic Oven opened or I would be hella broke. Awesome array of vegan and gluten-free baked goodies. And their gluten-free baked nom noms are amazing - fluffy, chewy, delicious! Not the \"brick\" many store-bought gluten-free foods end up being. I've had the chocolate cake, the cupcakes, the bread, the bagels (extra wow for these), and the pizza crusts (YUM).  They sell sandwiches there on great gluten-free bread. They used to be well priced at around $3 - which for a tiny sandwich on an english muffin with a slice of tomato, a slice of cucumber and a smidge of lettuce, this made sense. But, alas, the price shot up to like $7!!!! definitely not worth that price - so buy the yummy bread and make it yourself at home!  Make sure not to wait too late in the day, though! Their nom noms get bought out FAST!!"}
{"text":"Vegan and gluten free food is almost never as good as the \"real thing\".  That being said, this place is definitely a great place in the city for those who have alternative diets.  Note:  I have only been once.  Regarding being closed on Saturdays, I would say there is a good chance given the neighbourhood that they are being respectful of the Sabbath.  I hope people can respect that the Jewish Sabbath is observed from Friday night until Saturday evening, they seem to be doing the same.  On the plus side, it means that they are open on Sundays."}
{"text":"I am in this neighbourhood once a month (to see my orthodontist!) and as someone who tries to avoid gluten, I was thrilled to find Organic Oven. I bought a bag of their GF bagels. Fantastic taste. Not too crumbly like rice bread. Good without being toasted, something rice bread often fails. Moist.  I've also had a muffin there- pretty good flavour but a bit dry."}
{"text":"I don't have any food allergies but my boyfriend has celiac. Often when we go to cafes together, he has to watch sadly while I scarf down baked goods.   To be a good sport I took him to Organic Oven. It is a nice welcoming place. The coffee was really good. There is a wide selection of gluten free products. They even serve sandwiches made from gluten free bread.  I had a pumpkin muffin and it was very tasty and could hold up against a \"normie\" muffin.  Weirdly they are closed on Saturdays."}
{"text":"A cornucopia of GF options and even bagels, albeit deflated looking ones...but still a strong representation of Gluten-free options nonetheless.  The Vegan GF black forest cake was subpar, as the cake portion lacked cakey texture and was more grainy/mealy if anything but I'll still give kudos for effort as it's no easy feat mastering both GF and vegan baking combined.  The cupcakes however were pretty darn good, with a nice flavourful frosting.  Not the best, but not bad either.  The counter staff was really nice too, even inviting me to stay after hours for their trial Yoga classes, but I don't think the world is ready to see me doing King Pigeon Pose whilst stuffing my face with GF baked goods."}
{"text":"Colour me gluten-free!  Great place for people with celiac, and/or vegans and vegetarians.  Even if you're not in any of the above categories, this bakery is worth a visit if you're nearby.  Prices are a little $$, but at least the quality of the gluten-free goods is okay.  I purchased some raisin bagels, and one banana choc. chip muffin.  All vegan.  Taste was okay/kind of good.  I'd go ahead, because there aren't any health minded areas to get some grub, nearby.  Vegan-soups, bagel sandwiches, regular bagels.   other: A few non-veg options."}
