{"text":"Update.  I'm dropping a star from my previous rating because of their lack of consistency.  A couple of times in the past few months, the pizza dough wasn't cooked through and the sauce tasted different somehow.  Maybe it depends on who is cooking that night, but they really haven't delivered up to the standard set the first time we went."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Bellisario's and Mike, and Val, the mixologists, make THE BEST Dirty Martini I have ever had. - we will be back!  Great stuffed banana peppers and the Veal Marsala was excellent too!"}
{"text":"I so wanted this to be great. It wasn't. Pizza was tasteless and the crust was worse. Fries were undercooked. People were nice and cordial but our search for a good pizza place in the North Hills continues."}
{"text":"Great pizza Great price. White pizza the best with artichokes. mmmmmm. 3 pizzas enough to feed family of 7, three teens, and lunch for sat. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Local bar/dive.  Pretty decent pizza/food, though.  If you're having trouble finding it, just look for all of the pickup trucks in the parking lot."}
{"text":"I love the food at this restaurant.  Every dish is very fairly priced and also tasty.  The pizza is also something you should try."}
{"text":"Single handedly the worst experience I have had at a pizza place, hope you don't get the blonde server her attitude is horrible. Food is good but not good enough to deal with that we will stick to Luciano's better food and much better service.  Forgot to mention I watched a 10 top walk out because of the attitude they were given for coming in at 9:20pm. Sorry to the owner on losing sales like that."}
{"text":"Eat here for lunch 3-4x a week as it's just down the road from where I work. Don and his family know how to cook some damn food. Whether you're looking for Italian bar Food, Hoagies or Pizza, you will not leave dissatisfied. The Homemade Soups and changing daily specials keep myself and my colleagues coming back almost daily.  The ownership cares about their customers. Whenever I've needed to place a large order for something work related, the restaurant steps up and fulfills any wish. All the support to this family run and owned and LOCAL business."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever!  We always get pepperoni and ricotta.  Their house dressing is also to die for.  This is a great little authentic Italian place and we love frequently stopping in!  The bar is also fun too!"}
{"text":"I really like the menu.  Pizza and hoagies are excellent.  The crab cakes and wedding soup are very good.  I have not had better wedding soup anywhere.  I love the restaurant side, all of the waitresses are so nice to my children.  There is a bar and takeout too."}
{"text":"Just OK. Nothing horrible and nothing great. The pasta is apparently made on the premises but it tasted stale and bland. The chicken Napoli was rubbery and the sauce left much to be desired. Salad was meh...probably will not be back. Service was great though so that is an upside. I would give this establishment 2 1/2 stars if I could but it wasn't bad enough for 2."}
{"text":"We love this italian restaurant and eat here at least twice a week.  Almost everything we've tried is excellent and homemade.  Particular favorites are their homemade spaghetti and meatballs, chicken parmigiana, pizza, and italian hoagies.  Their delivery is extremely fast and the drivers are courteous.  Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was great! Lasagne, meatball sandwich and chicken tenders. Pizza looked great while waiting for takeout. Takeout beer was a plus. Would definitely come back, although take out line was packed and parking was a mess."}
{"text":"Bellisario's deserves a solid four stars in my book for wonderful service and decent-tasting, reasonably-priced food. My little nephew had his spiritual dedication at church a mile down the road from this restaurant, and being from all different parts of the city both sides of the family decided to gather here for lunch afterwards. We ate in the dining room, but there appears to be a decently large bar on the premises as well. The staff graciously accommodated our large party of ten at a really nice round table. We started with a round of appetizers, and the calamari and fried cauliflower were particularly good. The dipping sauces that accompanied the appetizers weren't out of this world interesting, but they were tasty and tomato-based which is all you really need at a down-home Italian place. I ordered a Cajun chicken dish, and it came deliciously dry-rubbed with spices and pounded until it was quite thin. I really enjoyed it! On the side were fresh-cut fries and roasted vegetables. I was so pleased to see roasted vegetable offered in a restaurant (too often they're just steamed) and mine had plenty of flavor and just the right amount of crispness. My mother ordered a salad that needed a bit of customization due to her gluten allergy, and our waitress was very gracious about that. The various pasta and chicken dishes ordered by everyone else looked great, and the crust on my little sister's pizza was apparently wonderful. We left full with plans to come back again when we're in the neighborhood. I love discovering well-run local restaurants, Bellisario's is a real gem in that regard."}
{"text":"We probably eat at Bellisario's once a month or so. The pizza's are fairly good here. Some favorites are the Buffalo Chicken and White versions of their standard round pizzas. The Sicilian is just OK (not a great sauce to dough ratio). We usually order out and pick up from here - always fast and never a hassle! It is consistently good and we have never had an issue with the carry out service here.   Their baked Italian hoagie, pasta dishes (Carbonara - YUM!) , meatball dinners, chicken parmesan dinners,  fried zucchini and mushroom appetizers are also pretty good. We LOVE the calzones (bigger than your head) and the dough is really good. They serve it with their homemade sauce and definitely do not skimp on the meats, cheeses, and toppings inside. These are really well made and you can fill them up with whatever you want!   One of the main reasons we like to eat here is the fact that we have never had to wait long for a table here no matter the size of our party - from 2 to 4 people or even 6 to 12 people - the service is always good and they work to accommodate as fast as possible. Its one of the main things that keep us coming back...and those giant calzones don't hurt either."}
{"text":"BEST pizza in the North Hills area!!! Pizza is always on point and staff is super friendly!"}
{"text":"Great friendly service. Great Italian food big portions for a really good price. Pizza is super good the crust. Was great on it. We will be back many times I'm sure"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh doesn't have many true local businesses, and I can't believe how many hateful reviews Bellisario's has.  Bellisario's is SO CHEAP.  Guys, what are we all doing complaining about CHEAP decent food?  Is it the second coming?  Not at all.  But they have good lunch prices and the food is consistent.  And the waitresses are super friendly and will recognize your face.  Some of them lack a little class, but they're fast, efficient, and friendly.  I consider myself a pro on the menu.  I've tried quite a few good things here, and I'm never disappointed.  Off the top of my head, here are some ideas:  Most meals come with the side of soup, salad, potato, or veggie, etc:  -Cheese Ravioli (Lunch:  $5.85/ Dinner:  $8.80):  Homemade ravioli is always good, and at these prices, what's not to love?  The portions are large.  They use large square raviolis, and the sauce is yummy as well.  -Crab Cake Parmesan and Pasta  (Lunch:  $6.75/ Dinner:  $9.50):  Ok.  This is a weird one.  The crab cakes are good.  There isn't a ton of crab, but for the price the amount is way more than you would expect.  The sauce and parmesan doesn't add anything for me.  But it's pretty good.  -Breaded Crab Cakes and French Fries  (Lunch:  $6.25):  This is the way I like my crab cakes.  They have a light deep fried breading, and there are a few good pieces of crab in each one.  The filler is pretty good.  Def one of my favorite lunches.  -Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato on Toast  (Lunch:  $3.45):  Uh.  See this price?  What more could you want?  Just like mom used to make.  -Turkey Club with Bacon and Cheese (Lunch:  $6.10):  I got this one day when I was sick.  Definitely nothing special.  I'd skip this one.  -Large 16x16 Sicilian Pizza ($11.90):  SUCH A GOOD DEAL.  My parents order this all of the time.  16 slice of pizza for $12?!?!?!  WHAT IS THIS?  So cheap and filling.  They claim the sauce is spicy... It's not.  I think it's actually pretty bland.  But it reheats well, and it's a great, cheap, lazy night option.  -Gnocchi (Dinner:  $11.05):  It's not easy finding homemade gnocchi in Pittsburgh.  This isn't the best, but it's some of the best Pittsburgh has to offer.  -Baked Ziti (Dinner:  $8.05):  Nothing to explain.  Simple and good.  -Bread Sticks ($5.95):  Ok.  Compared to everything else on the menu, these seem over priced.  But they're so good!  Nice and cheesy!  And the pair up with the pizza nicely.  My parents like the cannolis and tiramisu as well.  There is also a full bar attached to the restaurant, and it gets a pretty good crowd during sporting events.  And then you can get any alcoholic beveridge you can dream up in the restaraunt as well.  It's pretty cool.  I don't really know how the prices are, but it's a nice option.  Overall, this is a local spot geared at people that want somewhere cheap to eat and be full.  It has a bit of a diner feel to it, but is slightly classier looking.  Give it a try on your way past!"}
{"text":"We often have lunch delivered at our business and this was the first time from this restaurant. My co-worker ordered the ravioli which I found truly odd in that it was simply two large pieces of pasta. I ordered the roast beef club and cannot express enough that nobody should ever be subjected to such trash. First it was hot. A hot club sandwich? Second, it was frozen pressed steak patties; hardly roast beef. Third it was topped with what looked like canned cheese food and crowned with soggy white bread. The fries were greasy and soggy, as well. I threw the whole mess away after only a couple of bites; I wasn't going to waste the energy chewing it. The wedding soup was good. BFD. If somebody with deep pockets wants to wake up, there is a significant opportunity in the North Hills for a competent restaurateur because there is such a dearth of palatable stores with delivery. Next."}
{"text":"First time, last time! French fries were soft and way under cooked. Pizza was tasteless and meatball hoagie was just strange tasting. After taste is still with me and not in a good way. So disappointed! Still looking for a great place. I have learned the hard way, because people go and the place is open doesn't mean it's good! Save yourself!"}
{"text":"Great local Italian restaurant and bar. Definitely not a fancy place, but you come here for the food not for the ambiance. I crave their chicken parmesan often and love their spaghetti. The sundried tomato dressing is also a must try. The service isn't bad but is not fancy. The wedding soup is also excellent."}
{"text":"We dined there last evening, the wait staff are lovely ladies that want you to enjoy your night there.  My boyfriend had the tripe ($12).  I had to taste it also, you know.  The sauce was a deep meaty flavor and it was full of peppers & onions and had just the right spice.  It was delicious.  He totally enjoyed every bite.  I chose the lightly battered crispy chicken breast ($13)with fettuccine Alfredo with lemon.  It was very very delicious.  The dinners come with your choice of salad, or soup, we both had soup, wedding and beef veggie, both outstanding.  Again the service was really spot on, and the place was full of regular diners.  I love a good local, non franchise restaurant.  This one offers homemade, fresh daily, ingredients for a good price.  only down side, not much of a beer selection, but you cannot have it all.  The food more than made up for that !"}
{"text":"This place is my favorite Pittsburgh comfort food locations. Wonderful food. Delightful service and old school all over the place. The wait staff knows is by name and we don't go THAT OFTEN."}
{"text":"Been going here for a long time. Their pizza is excellent and their spaghetti and fettuccine alfredo are delicious. It is usually quite crowded around dinner time, so that is a sign it is doing well. I like this place a lot."}
{"text":"I've been eating at Bellasaio's since I was a kid. Their pizza is my favorite and the rest of the food never disappoints. If you're looking for some good, relatively quick italian food this is a great spot. If you're looking for flowery service and smiles all around this place may not be for you. Not to say the service is bad at all, everyone has always been more than friendly and I have never had any problems, but after reading some of the angry reviews, I just think people need to understand that this isn't the place you're gonna find 5-star service and some server kissing your ass. Go in, relax, and enjoy a good, reasonably priced meal and a well poured drink. Don't like it? Go down the street to drink your perfectly measured cocktail(that costs $3 more for a cheap pour) and eat your frozen chain food...."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I go here often I can't believe I'm just now writing a review. Everything we've ever had has been so good! The pizza is amazing as well! I love that the waitstaff all work together as well! Great food, great vibe. You will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Out of the four entrees we ordered, two of them had pieces if wire brush in them. Then they acted like we did something wrong by refusing to pay. The service is awful as well as the salads. The food is mediocre. I definitely will not be going back."}
{"text":"We loved it. Awesome homemade ravioli where they put some cheese in with the meat which is different and delicious!  The pizza was great also...great crust and cooked exactly the way u want.  Crispy and chewy at same time. Homemade gnocchi was also super. We topped it off with some solid house merlot and we will be back!  Oh I almost forgot.  I love that they all take care of the diners. The wait staff does not just take care of their assigned table. So u always have a full drink and a well bussed table. And they were all so friendly:-)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. All their food is made fresh daily, large portions and the price is right!  The Steeler game special, $1.00 drafts and slices of pizza can't be beat!"}
{"text":"4. 5 stars just for the pizza. Started a new job on Monday and my new boss went and picked it up for us today at lunch due to a big job being due at 2. He bought a variety, of course. I had a piece of pepperoni, piece of white, and a piece of deep dish pepperoni. It was all terrific. The crust is a nice mix of a sweet and salty. The cheese and sauce complemented it nicely, including on the white pizza. It was delicious and so great of the new boss to buy lunch for everyone. And I will definitely go back! And can I just say that I love my new job!"}
{"text":"It was ho hum. I love gravy fries. These were soggy fries with bland gravy. I did like the pasta but the pizza had a strange tomato sauce that was too think and not enough oregano. The salad was fresh. AND one last thing., I ordered delivery to my hotel. And they said they would call me. But they never called. I called them only to find out the delivery guy would be in the lobby any moment. Ugh!"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten within the restaurant or bar and have only ordered pizza for takeout - so this review applies to the pizza! I am the pizza snob, you know.  We had ordered from Bellisario's in the past, however, it had been a while and we couldn't remember if we liked it or not. OK - so maybe that should have been our first clue, but nevertheless, worth another shot.   We had a copy of the menu and noticed that they also have pan pizza. In the past, we had just ordered their regular \"hand tossed\". I'm more of a fan of pan pizza or a thicker crust. To me, most \"hand tossed\" pizzas are paper thin, greasy, and unremarkable.   The pan pizza isn't what you'd think of. I suppose we Americans are brainwashed into thinking pan pizza is one thing and one thing only. Bellisario's pan pizza isn't greasy and \"fried\" within the pan it bakes in because of all the oil. It's light and puffy, slightly sweet with a little crunch. It's not greasy at all, yet not dry or hard. It's reminiscent of what you'd make at home.   The sauce is smooth and mild, not overly spiced or acidic. Straight up decent pizza."}
{"text":"I really like this place and go frequently. Their alfredo sauce is so thick and delicious. The pizza crust is perfect. The servers are attentive and kind and sort of old school. It's always busy at dinnertime and the bar is so fun.   Their pasta is fresh (though the lunch portion/price is dry pasta) which I like, but sometimes gets stuck together in blogs and doesn't seem to cook evenly. But if it's covered in delicious alfredo sauce, I don't care too much.   One recent development I'm disappointed with is the $1 surcharge for credit card purchases. I don't care about a dollar, but I don't like feeling like I'm being nickel and dimed, and feel bad for the servers who have to tell customers that. And the signs posted about it are tacky AF. Left me questioning their business practices a little bit, so even though we used a card, we left a cash tip and plan to do so in the future."}
{"text":"Half bar and half restaurant, this review applies only to the bar.  I have eaten here several times on my North Hills visits (it is my Father In-Law's regular lunch spot with his neighborhood friends), yet I have never. seen more than the bar.  With that perspective, decent Italian food and service at a decent price.  Nothing stands out here as particularly good or bad.  just a good neighborhood spot where you can meet up with your friends."}
{"text":"1st time visitor. Tried the chicken parm dinner. The sauce was super thick and tasty. Loved it! The breading on the chicken was perfect as was the amount of cheese on top made it a melty plate of love. The Italian sampler was super as well with a nice bit of lasagna, eggplant rollatini and a very big ravioli which all tasted great. The only drawback was that the lasagna was a little too dry but other than that it was a very cool experience. Will be back again."}
