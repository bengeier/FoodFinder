{"text":"I am so glad they are here !! Had flavorful, freshly prepared dishes that were very satisfying.  The service was prompt and polite. In a culinary wasteland ( with maybe one or two exceptions) this restaurant is a welcome addition to this town. It is similar to the food I experienced in Thailand. Very tasty"}
{"text":"We have been here twice since their opening and have been very impressed by the authenticity of the food and the kind and prompt staff. Everything is prepared so well, you can really tell the difference of good quality ingredients. The plate presentation is something you would expect at a 5 star restaurant . The Thai iced tea and all the curries are my favorites. I also enjoyed the shrimp rolls. Can't wait to go back! Thanks again!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful addition to FH...So very welcomed... Found the meal to be very fresh and we'll done,.. Lovely presentations ..  It's a Big win for us in the Hills..."}
{"text":"Love this spot! The Pai Thai is awesome. Prices are great too for the quality and amount of food they give you."}
{"text":"Dined with two friends who are not experienced with Thai cuisine. Ordered three entrees and a soup (Tom Yum Talay seafood combo). All were solid, but the massaman curry and soup were outstanding! Small dining area with steady stream of take out customers. Superb addition to the FH dining scene!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place to eat in town. The food is much better than other Thai places within a 15 mile radius. The Tom Ka is normally not spicy enough for me, but ask for hot and it will be a perfect medium spice. Prices are spot on and everything I have tried is great."}
{"text":"Just had a wonderful meal at La Mai Thai Cuisine, always delicious and great hosts!  Those shrimp fresh rolls with just a hint of mint are so tasty and healthy too  :  )"}
{"text":"This used to be the best place for Thai food. We tried to order curry to go and they said that they would no longer sell us the curry to go.  I have never heard of a restaurant not selling things that they make.  Such a disappointment from a regular customer."}
{"text":"Run by a Thai family, so you'd think the food is great and somewhat authentic. Unfortunately this place is far from real Thai food. It's either too bland or if you ask for higher spice, you're dead. I threw out a whole portion of pad Thai with spice level 4. It was just raw spice  Low spice has no taste. Curries are ok. No comparison to like Thai house."}
{"text":"Wow, this was the best food I've eaten in a while.
Food is made fresh and they custom made rolls for my wife and I."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food. The red and yellow curry are both fantastic. The lunch special can't be beat. Friendly and efficient service. Clean kitchen. I went back again just a few days after my first visit and will surely return."}
{"text":"Great spot for Thai in Fountain Hills! Green curry was very fresh and flavorful and loaded with goodies! Right now they've got a deal where you get a free desert with your dinner - they brought us a Thai Custard (basically flan), just fantastic!"}
{"text":"Fresh food, friendly service.

Small, family owned place, great staff. 

They are a hidden gem in Fountain hills."}
{"text":"Great menu with quality food, but no alcohol service.  You can bring your own as did one couple that were quite inebriated and obnoxious, ruining the atmosphere.  It is very small with 7 tables, so you will have a wait during busy times."}
{"text":"I had a very nice lunch earlier in the week,  The chicken curry was just right, although it was a tad sweet for me.  Service was very good, with water and meal delivered promptly and with a smile.  I subtracted one star because I would have enjoyed my meal even more with a Singha.  But, alas, no alcohol is served here.  I will be back."}
{"text":"La Mai Thai opened in September and each week we've either had dinner there or picked up dinner to have at home. As we work our way through the menu we have never been disappointed. Their Pad Thai is as good as -- or even better than -- what I've had on the West Coast. And their curries are amazing, too."}
{"text":"Tried La Mai Thai tonight and it was delicious! Was craving peanut sauce so we ordered the Chicken Satay app with peanut sauce, shrimp pad Thai and I got a side of Tom Kha Kai soup. 

Soooooo good! 

Everything was fresh and vibrant. Even with the shrimp surcharge our meal was less than $30. Score!"}
{"text":"Having traveled extensively including Thailand, this is one of the most authentic Thai restaurants we have even been too.  there is nothing bad on their menu.  Fabulous,food, great service, cute place.  highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Our party of four came here for a birthday dinner celebration this evening. We had a couple of different springs rolls and a variety of entrees. All were excellent. Prices are moderate and the service was very good! Would def come back and try more dishes! We heard about it from friends who live in Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"Quick TL;DR: If you are scrolling through Yelp reviews like I was, trying to decide if this place is authentic, I promise you it's not. This is sweetened up, watered-down Thai food for older white people (who seem to like it, I might add). If Panda Express is your idea of authentic Chinese and you think Pizza Hut is authentic Italian, this might be your sort of place. If you're from out of town looking for good Thai food, try Chanpen Thai Cuisine, Thai E-San, or one of the many other good Thai places in Phoenix/Tempe/Mesa. You will not find it here.

Went here with my girlfriend a few weeks ago, hoping for a tasty Thai meal. We were sorely disappointed. I will admit that the food is all presented very elegantly. Our spring rolls were cut diagonally and arranged like a flower, while the Pad Thai I ordered came with an elegant sauce drizzle on top. In the case of La Mai, though, it's style without substance. 

The spring rolls were soggy and the filling gushed water. There was no taste to it whatsoever. Both of our main dishes were overly sugary -- far more than authentic Thai food should ever be. They offer a spice scale from 1-5, but even a 5 was not remotely spicy and still had an awkward sweetness -- it tasted more like General Tso's Chicken than pad thai. I added the chili sauce they had on the table but found that it was also too sweet, and it actually just made the dish worse. I asked the waitress if they could possibly make the dish spicier, only to have her go back to the kitchen and loudly complain to the cook that I didn't think my dish was spicy enough. She came back with a bowl of chopped Thai chiles, which was a strange solution to my request. I was expecting some sort of sauce but would've even been happy with them taking my plate back and cooking the chiles into the dish. Also, I ate some of the chiles on their own, and found they were lacking in heat and freshness. If a Thai chili is good, you should not be able to bite into it without feeling some sort of heat.

The waitress also didn't refill our water glasses once in the entire meal. We had to ask her to do so, despite the fact that we were one of only 2 tables actually eating in, and that she was standing right behind us for the majority of the meal. She was rude and condescending and did not seem to know how to treat customers. Hard pass for me."}
{"text":"This is the real deal. Pad Thai was perfect. Sour, salty with just a touch of sweetness. Panang was great as were chicken and noodles."}
{"text":"Very fresh ingredients and a good selection of Bangkok style Thai food. I am happy they have come to my town with some tasty curries and no nonsense stir fried noodle dishes. It is nice to see some business in this plaza. I believe they have reversed to curse that has plagued this location of 8 or more defunct restaurants since 2004. Great work guys."}
{"text":"I have been to Thailand before and I find the food here to be quite good.  It is really nice that Fountain Hills finally has a Thai restaurant; it was badly needed.  The place is small and can get crowded, especially at lunch time.  I prefer lunch here, as the prices are better.  The spices taste authentic and it is nice you can get the level of heat you want (1 for mild; 5 for hot).  The 5 isn't terribly hot, so if you like Thai food even a bit spicy, I would tend towards 4 or 5.  The Drunken Noodles were very good, but the other dishes I tried were good too."}
{"text":"First time eating their food. Had the spicy noodles and my boyfriend had the chicken noodle. I asked for level 4 (1-5 spicy scale) and it was perfect and tasty!  He prefers little to no spice and he devoured his meal. I can't wait to try their other food again. Seems like the kind of place where anything you order will be delicious."}
{"text":"A wonderful find. Great food, simple place, nice people.
Reasonably priced. We're pretty experienced with Thai food and this was awesome!"}
{"text":"Very very very good. So happy there's a legit Thai place here in Fountain Hills. This family owned place is named after the mom and the 2 sisters are the cooks. Needless to say, family recipes passed down the line. The beef soup is highly recommended and we customized our pad Thai with some duck. The spring rolls are delish too served in a martini glass and orchid. 

They deliver before 6pm. Come here. Eat. Support the FH business."}
{"text":"The best Thai food I've ever had. Got the Spicy Noodles w/ Pork. Not for the faint of heart, definitely spicy but very flavorful and fresh. This is a must stop if you even think you might like Thai."}
{"text":"Love this place! So glad it's here in town. A good friend of mine turned me onto La Mai. I love their Green Curry with tofu. I get \"Thai hot\" for the spice level. Delicious and fresh. Definitely a gem here in Fountain Hills! Take out or dine in, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Family owned small Thai restaurant, I enjoyed my dinner the other day. 

They have nice Thai theme decorations inside, I especially liked their elephant. They play Thai music from one of their famous movie, owner said it's her favorite movie when I asked.

Small dining areas, while I was there, all other customers came in was for pick up orders. They do deliver for up to 5 miles, which is pretty much most everywhere in town.

No alcohols here, but their regular tap water tasted very good. Perhaps reverse osmosis plus filtered? 

Food was very good, never been to Thailand so not sure what's considered authentic but curry I ordered had a very nice flavor. I also liked sauce for crispy tofu. 

Now I have their menu, I can order food to go while driving home for dinner when I crave for Thai food again. Price is very reasonable, very polite and friendly service, nice addition to the Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the Phoenix area by far! I've been here multiple times and I've never been the least bit disappointed, both for the price and quality. Pad Thai, any of the curries, and the Thai samosas are my favorite dishes. All the food is presented beautifully as well. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I've had a few different curries, soups and appetizers here and everything was absolutely incredible, flavorful, and spiced just right! I am thrilled to have such an amazing Thai restaurant here in fountain hills!"}
{"text":"Amazing Thai Food!! This place is top notch!
Authentic, fresh, high quality, and an amazing treat for the town of Fountain Hills. 
I have been there twice with my family and each time was impressed."}
{"text":"A tiny tucked away treat of a place. Our party of four all thoroughly enjoyed our delicious dinners and the lovely presentation. A great addition for Fountain Hills gastro-scene."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food especially the fried Pompano fish. No wine or beer. Very informal. Not expensive."}
{"text":"My husband and I have traveled through Asia so it's hard to find Asian food we like in AZ. But La Mai is really good! Fresh, flavorful and not oily. Here are some important tips:

1. If you are a Thai food lover, you WILL want to ask for \"extra spicy\" for every dish...if you are a crazy Thai foodie, ask for extra extra spicy
2. Fresh Thai rolls are awesome
3. Thai rice with chicken, beef and shrimp is super yummy..
4. Love the shrimp rolls..simple but delish 
5. Love the red curry and there was a spicy chicken coconut soup that I could have bathed in
6. Would not order samosas again but we are samosa snobs"}
{"text":"I love this new Thai restaurant that just opened three months ago.  Thai Hot (5-6+) for my husband and milder 2 for me.  Perfect!  Tasty, fresh, better than anything I've had elsewhere.  Small, family owned,very friendly.  Food is hot, fresh and delicious!  Free delivery within five miles.  A real find in Fountain Hills!"}
{"text":"Outstanding. Fresh, light, great flavor, great service even when crowded. Would drive a long way for this!"}
{"text":"OK seriously amazing. This is the best Thai food my husband and I have ever had, and we eat Thai probably at least twice a month. Makes me consider moving to AZ from Indy... :)

Was a little worried when we walked in; the restaurant was SO small. But we were seated immediately, had impeccable service, and awesome food. I got the Green Curry. It had great flavor, and I loved all the veggies they put in. My husband got Pad Thai, and loved it. It had many more flavor dimensions than our usual Pad Thai. Our only (minor) disappointment was the Mango Sticky Rice, which did not come in the shape of a flower (but still tasted amazing). 

Next time we visit AZ, this will be a must-see."}
{"text":"Felt like some soup and didn't want to eat out. So I called In an order of fresh roll, Tom Yum Kai soup and Duck Noodle soup. Said it would be ready in 15-20 minutes. Picked up the items after 25 minutes.
Arrived home and put everything out. The soup was still piping hot and the noodles came in a separate container. Put the rice noodles in a bowl and poured the duck meat and soup on top. Duck was nice and tender and noodle cooked perfectly.
The TomYum Kai soup was perfect for my wife and the fresh roll was just as tasty with the sauce. Will do it again in the future."}
{"text":"Wonderful place to eat! The curry is fantastic and the dessert is phenomenal! Everything is served and presented beautifully, and the service is very friendly. Prices are very reasonable, only $8 for a delicious lunch. Though very small, it is clean and well-decorated, and filled with the smell of delicious Thai food!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. 
I've been a few times now. And. YUM! It. Is. SO. Good! I've had a few different things, my fave is the Green Curry with chicken. My husband likes the Red or Panang. I like mine low on the heat and he likes his HOT. They accommodate us both every time.
Serving size is perfect. Staff is friendly and helpful. They do a good to go business, there's always people running in and out when we're there. Oh, AND they have a small delivery area too (I think 4 miles).
I love that we have such an authentic Thai place in FH!"}
{"text":"We really wanted this to be a good Thai place here in Fountain Hills so that we didn't have to go to Scottsdale every time. (this is a staple for us every week).  Wasn't looking for great...just decent. Unfortunately, our first experience was disappointing as we ordered two classic dishes: Pad Thai and Spicy Fried Rice ....Pad Thai is a dish that should be consistent in flavor, regardless of where you order it..this dish had a flavor that was not consistent at all with the dish and was quite bland (was ordered at a medium spice). On the contrary, the Spicy Fried Rice was over powered with flavor, but it was unfortunately too much sodium and soy sauce...and pretty much inedible.  Based on the other reviews, it may be worth trying again, but quite frankly, with so many other strong and consistent Thai restaurants within a 10 mile radius, it's likely we'll make the trek down the hill for the sure thing."}
{"text":"We have tried a few Thai places in the Scottsdale area and this one was probably the best. We had been living in Southern California and we used to some pretty authentic Thai places that served dishes bursting with flavor. La Mai was good but some of the dishes we had was pretty bland. The fried rice tasted closer to white rice than fried and the Pad Thai lacked that traditional taste. Overall it was pretty decent and I would try it again, but nothing to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"First time dining at La Mai. We had heard some good things. Food was freshly prepared and delicious. Sauces were delicate and not overpowering. Dishes were large enough to share but we didn't!The only thing that could use improvement is their timing with serving. As each dish is freshly prepared they serve only 1 person's plate at a time so the rest of the table waits a bit for their dishes...not a big deal, just awkward. The hi lite was when a young man asked us how our dinners were and I asked if he was our chef and he said \"no, I'm the dishwasher.\""}
{"text":"Visited for a early dinner.  First time trying Thai food.  Glad it is soy free and no msg.  Not real sure what I expected.  I thought the food portions are lacking for the price.  One person for dinner is around $30. which I thought was expensive for the amount of food you get.  I like the papaya salad expected it to me a little sweet but it was on the soar side.  The coconut soup was also on the soar side probably due to the lemongrass in it.  The fresh spring rolls were just lettuce mint and one little tiny piece of chicken - which I would not recommend for the price.  I can not say I have experienced better because this is the first time I tried Thai food but was not happy about the food, the quantity or the prices.  Maybe Ill try another place to compare it with"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Thai food in Fountain Hills. This place is small but there are great foods quality. Thumbs up for this place. By the way the owner is very friendly."}
{"text":"My son and I just had dinner here and it was fantastic. The freshest Thai food I have had in the valley. I had the Pad Thai and it was unbelievable. I went with  3 for hotness on their scale of 1 ~ 5 and it was perfect. It was just slightly spicy yet it did not over power all the individual flavors of the sprouts, carrots and onions. I love this place. My son had the spicy noodles and he said they were delicious as well."}
{"text":"Great new Thai restaurant in Fountain Hills. 7 table intimate setting. Casual dining. Owners run the restaurant themselves. Great food. Good service. The #28 Chicken Noodles was great. Had it mild. I will be back."}
{"text":"What a great find!  We stopped in here for lunch and we found the food to be very fresh and authentic (having actually been to Thailand) and the prices VERY reasonable.  The service was beyond excellent - our piping hot food came out very promptly and our server checked in with us several times to make sure we had everything we needed.  We will most definitely be adding this to our short list of favorite restaurants in Fountain Hills."}
{"text":"This little gem in FH is hard to spot but worth the effort. Their menu has something for everyone from mild to THAI HOT and all places in between. It is fresh, fast and DELICIOUS! 

Service is laid back but good. Be careful with to go orders though. The communication was awful today and instead of NO CILANTRO, (allergic) we all got extra cilantro. If not for this I would give ++++4 stars

For a casual meal & the price this is really good! $7.95 lunch specials and dinner isn't more than $15."}
{"text":"We LOVE, love love this place.  We used to go to Tempe to Yupha Thai to get great Thai food.  Now that La Mai has opened we never leave town for Thai food!!  We eat there or or have it delivered at least once a week.  Very fresh, great flavors!  Fast delivery."}
{"text":"We really enjoy take-out from La Mai.  I typically order the Green or Panang Curry, my hubby usually orders either Pad Thai with chicken or Panang Curry with chicken level 5 spice, & our 11 year old loves the Chicken Satay with side of peanut sauce & the spring rolls or the chicken fried rice..  Staff is efficient & friendly!"}
{"text":"Outstanding REAL Thai Food.. Family owned..  family recipes..   FRESH and Very Tasty.. PAd Thai, Panang, Larb Salad,  I am hooked on the Glass Noodles...  Wonderful dish presentations and the family is so very nice..  The paintings are done by the owner..  nicely decorated.. Really dig the elephant and mums around the kings picture..  Only 6 tables inside and 1 outside.. we take out more then we eat in..  They deliver..  You can customize your dishes..."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, this is so yummy and fresh. The Thai iced tea is pure heaven with a straw. The Silver noodles lunch special \"D\" is light and delicious, and the chicken is perfectly cooked. The carry-out service is quick and the staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"They had a great selection on their lunch menu at a great price as well.  We started with a salad with Thai peanut dressing. The dressing was delicious!  I would go back for that alone. 
We had the pad Thai and the green curry. Both dishes exceeded expectations. Would gladly go back and recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Had lunch today and it was great.  Spring rolls and chicken with noodles were outstanding."}
{"text":"I will start with the positives: 
The food was presented beautifully. Thai Samosas were also good.

The rest: The spring rolls, while presented beautifully, had no flavor and were soggy. My boyfriend ordered a 5/5 spicy and his food was sugary sweet and not spicy at all. My food was also sweet and not spicy or all that Thai flavored at a 4/5. My boyfriend asked for more spice and was given attitude and then some Thai chilies that also were not spicy.
Service left a lot to be desired. Restaurant was nearly empty and we had to ask for our water glasses to be refilled. We are not from here but chose this place based off the reviews. Maybe we just caught them on an off day but I can safely say we won't be back."}
{"text":"I was feeling terrible with a sinus infection, and discovered this place on my lunch break from work. Had a very lovely little meal and ordered some wonton soup to take home for dinner later. I'm very impressed with the cleanliness and customer service. Super friendly staff and the food was fantastic. Lovely is an understatement. The gorgeous flower in my dish definitely brightened my day."}
