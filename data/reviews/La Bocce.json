{"text":"By far the BEST pizza/sandwich restaurant in Vegas!! A must visit!!  I come here 2 to 3 times a week and am never disappointed! They make quality, great tasting food consistently. Some of my favorite items are the chicken finger sub with bacon, grilled chicken sub, meatlovers pizza, lasagna with meatballs and sausage, calzone and philly cheesesteak. Everything is freshly prepared for every order!  The owner and workers are all nice and courteous individuals who are willing to do anything to make sure you are satisfied with your meal. I HIGHLY recommend La Bocce if you live in Vegas or are just visiting because it's just minutes from the airport and the strip. And they deliver as well! And they are open late daily!"}
{"text":"I dream about the Italian meat sandwich at night."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, with me traveling, its a nice reminder of this place back home, all freshly made food. It was delicious."}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza. Close to outlet malls. We ordered two small pizzas and added toppings. You may order by the slice also. Fresh and hot is what our wish was. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Drove into Vegas, popped onto Yelp to find some food, and found this place. Stopped in and immediately saw the Buffalo sports teams on the walls. Bring from Buffalo, I took it as a good sign.  I ordered a whole sub. My friend got a calzone. My sub was delicious--good taste, and lightly crispy bread. My friend gave his calzone a solid 8/10.  Recommended for some place cheap and chill--especially if you're from the Buff!"}
{"text":"Ordered a grilled chicken sandwich to go on the way to the airport. Excellent quality, great taste!  It even sat in my bag until I returned the rental car, and got through security."}
{"text":"I go here about once a week! Love the lunch specials.  The owners are very involved, I wish them well.  Will continue to eat my lunch here."}
{"text":"Very friendly guy at the counter. Grilled Chicken Sub is a must have, and Chicken wings were very good. Chicken Fingers were just okay.  And it's Halal."}
{"text":"I don't understand the high ratings. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. I ordered a pastrami sub and the meat was awful. I love pastrami and I am not a picky eater. I'll eat just about anything. It tasted like burned vinegar. The roll it was served on was very good. Fresh perfect. Fortunately for me I ordered a salad so I was able to have bread after scraping off the meat and a salad and for a whopping 30 dollars! That included delivery to my hotel. Next time I'll drive to a restaurant or eat a TV dinner."}
{"text":"This is a nice small place - great for lunch. I was visiting a client in the area at lunch time and started looking for a fast pace to grab a bite to eat between my two appointments. I noticed La Bocce restaurant,  which looked cozy and authentic Italian. I ordered a personal size Pizza with a few of my favorite topings. The pizza was prepared very fast, but fresh-to-order. It was delicious and the price totally reasonable.  I recommend this place if toy are looking to get a fast bite when you are in a hurry. They also deliver."}
{"text":"Truly a great place. All the food is delicious. I have been visiting this place for months which speaks for it self. I literally tried very thing in the menu and liked them all. My personal favorites are grilled chicken sub, chicken finger sub, philly cheesesteak and Pizza with any topping I want.  The also catered to my office events ranging from 10 to 100 people and it was as delicious.   Besides food the service and ambiance are also great."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I've had the last 20 years in Las Vegas. Great subs as well. As a Buffalo pizza guy that now lives here there is no where else to get a great pizza ."}
{"text":"Must try this place. I came to this place for the first time yesterday on someones recommendation. Love there hot subs. I am back again today. The place is filled with Muhammad Ali posters. The champ is here...!"}
{"text":"BEST I EVER HAD!!!!!!!!! My fav: -PHILLY CHEESESTEAK -SPICY BBQ WINGS -CHICKEN SUB (not a chicken fan but I have converted after the tender smokin flavor chicken) -AND OF COURSE THEIR PIZZA!!  Man so far everything I have ordered has been good.   Ok let me make this clear, I am an EXTREMELY Picky eater, I like each bite to be the best taste, juicy, and chicken well cooked and smells fresh and tender and so on.... THIS PLACE MEETS ALL of my requirements!!!!!!!!  When people cook with their hearts, that is what makes a good restaurant. The chef is super skilled...God bless him and his family.   And the beautiful thing is, they make sandwiches that are not even on the menu on request, of you like something on one sub you can add it anywhere. Whatever your tastebuds want, they'll do it, not only do they do it, but they perfect it.   GOD BLESS THEM. mA.  Will be going again tomorrow"}
{"text":"The owner Jenn delivered our pizza and was really nice. Pizza was great size and tasted amazing. New York style slices with a good sauce. Would order again."}
{"text":"Exactly one week ago today for the first time, I tried this pizza and it was great. Today I ate it again and it tasted great. I honestly don't eat the pizza crust in any pizza but this pizza is really good and everyone working there greet you and make you feel welcome !! They are awesome"}
{"text":"Finally I've found a sub shop that his a big menu and good food!  The chicken finger sub is the best I've had on this side of the Mississippi. Just the right amount of crunch to the sub role and perfectly breaded juicy chicken. Just can't beat it"}
{"text":"I drive a taxi in Las Vegas and am always on the lookout for good places to eat lunch in different parts of town I find myself in. LA Bocce is my favorite place south of the strip. The sandwiches are my favorite in town and the pizza is excellent. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love this place! Best cheesesteak I've had in a long time!! I will definitely be coming back here. I will also refer my other friends"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. Owners are polite and friendly. They take orders on the phone and prepare them for you before you arrive. It has a cafeteria style setting with tables and chairs; can easily accomodate small groups. The ambiance is nice and clean; you may certainly bring family and kids.   I certainly recommend their philly cheese steak -- it's to die for!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best wings I've had in town. They are perfectly crisp & the traditional buffalo sauce is amazing. The owner is very friendly & the service is great. I've eaten here several times now (the wings are that good ) & I have not been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"Buffalo, NY people, this is the place for home town, pizza, wings and beef on weck! They make the \"real\" Buffalo style pizza with authentic Sorrento cheese. Their wings are large, juicy and tasty. The owner has relocated from the Buffalo area like the rest of us. He was so wonderful to talk with and reminisce about all we know and love about WNY! This was our first time there due to a great review in the RJ. We' ll be back bringing friends and trying the chicken fingers, subs and Friday fish fry.  Linda S."}
{"text":"Very nice customer service, very clean place, very very fresh clean food they serve, love these guys. I will always consider them. In future."}
{"text":"This is a great place to enjoy your food. Their philly cheese steaks and calzones are cooked properly and taste wonderful. The service is also good. They are always there to assist. Overall, it's a nice place to eat great food with good hospitality. Definitely a favorite. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"food is delicious, and the service is fast and friendly, especially if you are on your lunch break.   the cannoli is very good. we go there at least every week."}
{"text":"Great food, this my new favorite place for pizza and kabobs. I will be definitely going back again. If you are looking for some great pizza and kabob. This is the place."}
{"text":"Ordered through the yelp eat24 app. Specifically ordered a philly cheese sub with no mushrooms and put in the notes that I am allergic to them. An hour later get the sandwich and it's full of mushrooms. So disappointed and the sub went in the trash sadly."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza with a lot of toppings to choose from. Their buffalo chicken wings are big and crispy. Chicken fingers are saucy and so good (especially chicken finger sub!) white pizza is the BEST in town and beef on weck is very tasty and juicy on traditional Kennewick bun. You have to check this place out- I'm telling you the best food in town!"}
{"text":"Not so much decor or ambiance, but the food and the owners are awesome!  The sandwiches are really good, as is the pasta/spaghetti. The quality and taste is very good. I should come here more often but for some reason I forget it is there."}
{"text":"Never again. I've been a faithful customer for several years. Totally disappointed. Placed our usual Friday night order. Forgot the fries, second time in the last 2 weeks . Took 1 and 1/2 hours to get the fries! Really???? Looking for a new place. Signed bank lady ( I think you know who I am)"}
{"text":"I come in here every chance I get, they're my favorite Italian place! If I didn't live so far I'd be in here everyday! The Italian sub is my favorite. They also have the BEST wings. I've also had the strawberry cheesecake which is delicious as well. Pretty much everything I've had here has never failed. & the customer service is great, everyone knows me by know & greets me so friendly. Love love love this place (:"}
{"text":"Great calzones. Didnt care much for the italian beef but im from chicago so maybe Im harder to please with that? The guy working the counter is not very friendly or helpful at all.   TIp- Be careful on how many ingredients you choose for your calzone. I ended up having a $22 calzone because I wanted a few different types of peppers. I dont agree with their upcharges but if you keep it simple, its a great value."}
{"text":"Food is 5 stars but I have to give 3 because I ordered 12 chicken finger bucket on the menu here it says it comes with celery and fries and it really doesn't. So please change that, it would have affected my order if I had known. Food was fantastic tho"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I got a pastrami and. T husband got a ham sandwich which onion rings. It was suppose to come with mayo, tomatoes and onions. and I got mustard, no tomato, onion and 2 slices of pastrami on hard bread. My husband sandwich had one slice of meat. That and my sandwich was cold when it was supposed to be hot. I've never been so upset with a restaurant."}
{"text":"I had the Philli Cheesesteak and it was good   The owner is pretty welcoming and I would definitely come back next time when I am in town.."}
{"text":"Great place for pizza. Love the buffalo wings! Definitely visit the place again if I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing- tiny place- but delicious food! If you are from NY you know what real pizza is- and this place has awesome pizza! The chicken fingers are great as well.  Cant wait to go back-"}
{"text":"Very good pizza!!!  The meat is high quality halal meat. The crust is crispy yet delicate at the same time. The sauce to cheese and ingredient ratio is perfect. I've had a lot of great pizza and this spot is right up there in comparison to some of the best I've had.   I've ordered within the restaurant and I've also ordered delivery. Consistent both times. Quality ingredients so the price is a little higher, no big deal it is well worth it.   Side note... They also have sandwiches and meat kabobs here."}
{"text":"I ordered food for pick up through mypizza and got also a order confirmation. When I arrived I was told in a rather rough way that there is no pick up order and that they have stopped working with mypizza. He then checked his phone and found the order. After clarifying if paid or not and even if there was tip included (!!!!, it was....) I got my calzone and salad. Mypizza called as well and said that they can't confirm the order from this place because they are too busy at the moment. What a mess. The quality of the food was average, the customer service and how they handled this small issue was disappointing. Why not just apologize instead of arguing about the tip?"}
{"text":"La Bocce has become my new favorite restaurant in the Las Vegas area.  From the Muhammad Ali posters & Chicago memorabilia, to the rotating rotisserie oven and freshly baked bread, and to the incredibly varied and delicious offerings on the menu--this restaurant is truly a hidden gem.  It's hard to find a restaurant with this much soul--let me tell you why.  The menu has everything from pizza, to burgers, to an array of sandwiches (the BEST Philly cheesesteak of my life), subs, calzones, gyros, LEGIT fries (yes, better than McDonald's), pastas, lasagnas, wings, Chicago dogs, soups, salads, desserts and so much more.  Italian, Greek, Mediterranean, and American (New York/Chicago) style fusion. Even the selection of juices and beverages is impressive. It's extremely hard to find a restaurant with such a wide variety of offerings--yet somehow manages to hit the mark every single time. It's obvious the food is cooked to order with great care: the sandwiches come out perfectly toasted, and the seasonings are just right.   What impresses me the most about La Bocce is the owner. You will recognize him immediately as he exudes an unmistakably respectable, calm, and welcoming aura.  The beef and chicken he selects is prepared in a particularly humane and clean way--so you can enjoy your meal, guilt-free, without worrying about the heartless abuse taking place against animals on most factory farms that supply our restaurants in town. A sign on the door reads: \"people with no money welcome to eat free.\"  The owner is clearly a man of integrity, with a heart close to God.  Very positive vibes.    This is the place I sit down to have my weekly \"comfort-food-cheat-meal\" but I've been finding myself here more than once a week! It's a pleasure to eat here, and a pleasure to write this review. 5/5."}
{"text":"This place is prob the best halal restaurant in Vegas. Their pizza is so good. We ordered so much stuff and we loved it all. The grilled chicken sub was average, however. Wings, pizza, Philly cheese steak- all so good. The customer service is even better though. Owner is such a nice guy. Definitely going to stop by here every time we visit the city."}
{"text":"Great pizza and subs. 4 year old niece couldn't get enough of the cheese pizza which is far from her norm. Chicken Parm Sub was hug and great. Tasty toasted bread. Plenty of chicken and amazing sauce.   Service was prompt and great. Very \"Mom and Pop\". Lots of regulars whom all the workers and owners new by name and by order.  Very impressed. Sad I don't live in Vegas anymore. Will stop by when in town.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I used to like and respect this place, but recently I was stiffed by them. The sign said fries were 2.50, yet when I go to order, he manually puts in 3.00. I am suspicious of this manual entry being different than advertised price. They also refused to change the sign and my order. I left without eating the fries, because after I complained about there false advertisement, they looked at me with a bad look and I thought they could've tampered with my fries."}
{"text":"Food great just one time I ordered a chicken Alfredo it was mega watery but other than that food is delicious"}
{"text":"It has been a while to find Pizza that is worth eating. Thanks to a coworker and my fellow yelpers this place is Really Good.  We called the order in and then went and picked it up. The Owner was so nice to talk to and so grateful in how we heard about him to come in.  We ordered a large Pepperoni pizza and two Chicken Parmesan sandwiches. I have to say first everything is huge!! We ended up with not only dinner food but, breakfast and dinner for the next night.. The sauce to the pizza is so flavorful it just had your taste buds wanting more!! The crust is between a thin and thick which was perfect. One slice was like you were eating two slices. The Chicken Parm subs were good. Lots of sauce, cheese and breaded chicken and it was put on a sesame seed sub bread.  We will be back to try more on the menu. They have a variety of subs, wings, pizza and a white pizza and dessert. They do delivery as well as they have nice tables and chairs with a tv to eat there. They are open 7 days a week. M-f 9:30am to 8:30pm, sat 11am to 8:30pm and Sun 9:30am to 6pm.."}
{"text":"Great wings and pizza. Yea it costs more than the crappy places like Little Ceasars but hey- better quality.  And the staff is super nice."}
{"text":"Yelp did me wrong!  I call to place an order for a pastrami sandwhich ($10.95) and a small salad ($4.95) for pick up. he tells me 15min. I arrive after 20min and the food is ready to take. I pay for it and go. when i get home i open the salad and there is no dressing and the $5 salad is served in a small dessert togo container (5 or 6 bites of iceberg). i then get to the pastrami sandwhich and the sadwhich is covered in sourkraut and burnt pieces of old pastrami. i take a few bites just to try and its disgusting. pastrami and sourkraut dont mix!!!   now it gets crazy.... i call and the cashier is very aplogetic and tells me to come back and they will fix it.... i come back and the chefs and cashier come to the counter to take my food back. they dont say anyting they just take the bag and give me a bottled water and tell me to sit down fr 5 min. i wait a total of 15min and they come back to give me my order. the salad is in a bigger container and i see the dressing so i figure its all good.... but its not, the sandwhich is the exact same. literally they took the exact same meat and sourkaut i cxomplained about and put it in a new piece of bread."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch with my team of 12 while doing some training down the street at double tree by Hilton. Great food don't get me wrong we had 2 family feast which included pizza and wings. And Conoli for desert. The gentleman working was nice but misinformed us about the special. He told me that my guys can grab a drink each and it's included. Afterwards as I paid he was oh no drinks were separate. Money is never an issue but the simple principle of not lying goes a long way."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent, but the brothers who run the place are even better: They're great guys who are genuine, care about the customers, and have good senses of humor and incredible hospitality. You can't go wrong by going to La Bocce."}
{"text":"Comeon please. Why you have to be expensive for a basic food items. $11.99 sandwich (total). I can go to subway and get better quality and better deal for my money. Next time i am going there.   I have been coming to this place from last 2 years. Instead of better its getting"}
{"text":"Excellent place.  All the employees are really nice, they even threw in some free muffins and hummus on two separate occasions.  Food was really good, I like the turkey and Italian subs. He place is open late but was about to close around midnight. There is enough seating available although it's more of a take away place.  Zabiha halal, confirmed by their employees which is awesome!"}
{"text":"Yes! I finally beat those 2 or so Yelpers in the area who always completes their reviews before me.    (3.5 Star) La Bocce Pizzeria is a new pizza spot that just opened up a couple weeks ago.  I noticed a new sign passing by one day and decided to stop by the next.  I never made it to Bono's which held this location before but I will always try a place if it seems new.  First off these guys are pretty damn cool, I walked in actually way pass their 9:30 pm closing time, which I didn't know at the time, and they were cool with making me something.  I asked for what's the fastest meal they could make because I was hungry and low on time, plus they were closed.  They suggested and made my chicken tenders and fries, it come out hot and quick. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/la-bocce-las-vegas?select=tqgS_vbqf4KopA3S8DNfLQ#7_p9tfUuZXIG9WhjGQQsQA  The servings were good, my container literally spilled out because there was a lot of food inside.  The chicken tenders were alright.  I did finish the plate and felt happy, first meal of the day.   They have lots of lunch specials which run 'til 4 pm.  I haven't tried anything else on their menu yet but the calzones already has my name on it for the next time.  It's only $6.75 calzone and soda for lunch.  They have pizza by the slice and desserts. They also have your subs, salads, apps, and pizza and pasta items.  Expect an updated as I'll probably frequent this place and try more food. It's new so of course it's clean.  It's a neighborhood type, casual dining restaurant so it's not fancy or upscale.  They have an old pay phone, which doesn't work yet, always cool.  A big TV hung and lots of seating also cool.  No liquor yet but there's a PT's right next door. How about running some kind of special during or around PT's happy hours that would be awesome.   After ordering I talked with one of the owners 'til the food was ready and he was cool.  I received awesome service which always makes up for anything in my book.  These guys are from Buffalo, NY as you'll see the Buffalo Sabres jersey hung on the wall. It's always a pleasure talking with new business owners and sharing their experiences of being new and what they want to do with the business. I wish them all the luck.    5 stars rating for service, excellent first impression.  The neutral 3 star rating for food because I have to try more but liking their menu so maybe it's going to be higher soon.  It averages out to 3.5 stars for me, technically its 4."}
{"text":"The food is amazing; always fresh and tasty. The owner is very friendly and generous; I always see him talking to customers. I'm definitely impressed by how clean they keep the store too.the menu has a huge variety of subs, pastas, wings, pizza, etc. and they serve slice pizza combos at a really good price. The pizza sauce tastes slightly sweet with crispy thin crust and they're always generous with the toppings, but my favorite is the subs! The bread is always toasted perfectly and they put a lot of toppings on for what you pay."}
{"text":"I really, really liked this place. We went in on a Monday, a holiday Monday and surprisingly they were still honoring their M-F lunch specials. We tried their pepperoni calzones and our 4-year old had their cheese pizza. We all loved our meals and the delicious ricotta added to the calzone made it extra delicious. Our kiddo, needless to say, loved their pizza. Not only is the food delicious, but their customer service was top notch. It is not always about the food, but also about the pride owners take in making their food. This place did not disappoint and we will be returning."}
{"text":"A little hole in the wall with great subs and wings. Sub bread was fresh sesame seed bun. Wings with perfect amount of sauce. Nice casual lunch spot."}
{"text":"Great place love the phillies cheese."}
{"text":"Really awesome place. Really liked the variety on the menu. Veggies sub was grwat. Got a sampler and really good. was generous on the amount of food on the sampler. Very attentive to the customees."}
{"text":"This restaurant is just what the doctor ordered:) The food is always fresh and delicious, the place is always clean and the staff are generous and friendly ...  I have tried their pizza, sandwiches, rotisserie chicken, hummus.  NO REGRETS.  Bottom line is, whatever you'll order, you'll be impressed and I guarantee you'll go back again and again."}
{"text":"When I seen on facebook that a new halal restaurant had opened, I had to check it out. Turns out that the owner is an owner of another previous restaurant on the other side of town. Improved big time from the last time I went to his previous restaurant.  I got a philly cheesesteak.. it was very nice.. very quick in making.. I will definitely eat here again.. I did not try anything else.. but the philly cheesesteak is worth trying for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and sandwiches!!! Super friendly owner! The prices are great too. I had no complaints about this spot. Will def be going back in the near future"}
{"text":"6 month update...So I decided to try this restaurant again and once again I ran into the same problem I ordered pepperoni lover and the pizza did not have enough pepperoni or cheese for that matter and the flavor was definitely lacking once again service what's quick but the pizza is sub par. I want order no more."}
{"text":"For  a moment you walk back into Buffalo with amazing tastes and smells! The chicken finger sub and BBQ wings were delicious and crispy!! A must for all Buffalonians!"}
{"text":"Found this place on our way to return our our rental car (very convenient to airport). We were cheerfully greeted by the owners as soon as we walked in. We ordered the mozzarella sticks, cheese pizza and a caprese salad. Everything was great. The pizza crust seemed homemade and the mozzarella sticks were nice and melty and not rubbery or chewy. The salad was fresh with a good amount of mozzarella, and came with separate cups of oil and vinegar. Lots of Buffalo memorabilia on the walls. Cute little place with friendly staff and good food."}
{"text":"Very disappointing food, although the staff was very friendly.  Went around 1045pm but the place was about to close, even though they advertise they are open until 1am. Ordered ravioli, gyros, cheesesteak and beef pepper sandwiches. Except for the beef, everything else had very low salt and not much flavor. The pepper beef had too much salt and was very dry.  Also, the order took around 30 mins to prepare, which again is just wrong. Would not recommend, bad food, slow service."}
{"text":"Every time I go here I get the fried eggplant pizza and it's absolutely delicious. They're hummus is out of this world as well."}
{"text":"We were so hungry and excited based on the high reviews. We had the chicken Alfredo and the chicken hot wings. The Alfredo dish came with a garden salad and garlic bread. The salad was 99% lettuce and the bread was 99% margarine. The wings were dry and tasted like old cooking oil. The Alfredo sauce was tasteless."}
{"text":"We really love this place! So much that we're sitting in the restaurant writing this review. They have great by the slice lunch specials that are available Mon-Fri but we're offered to us even though it's Saturday. They also have a full menu full of delicious things and a specials board. We got a few slices, BBQ wings, chicken fingers and the Gouda Mac and Cheese Bites. We are there are everything was so delicious and both men there (owners I believe) were so incredibly nice and friendly. The pizza is slightly sweet and the crust is just crispy enough! BEST PART...they deliver! So happy to have finally found this place!!!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try La Bocce late night after a run. I was starving and a calzone was calling my name. I got there at about 10:30 pm and was happy to see it was still open. (Until 1am most nights) I felt like I walked straight into an Italian Deli in Buffalo, New York. Coming from a family of Bills fans, this is their kind of place.  The cashier noticed I was exhausted and gave me a bottle of water on the house; unfortunately, that was where the positives stopped. I  I ordered a caesar salad and personal-sized veggie calzone, paid about $20, and expected a 20-25 minute wait since they are made-to-order. The restaurant was empty except for me and another table who had already received their food. It would have been nice if the cashier had given me an approximate time that I would be waiting, because it took 45-50 minutes to receive my order.   The calzone was okay, a personal size is plenty to fill up a hungry runner with some to spare. The veggies were cooked well and had delicious cheese and crust. There was not much flavor other than that: the veggies needed some salt and pepper, or something!! The sauce that came along with the calzone was in the smallest container possible and also had very little flavor. When I got home I used some high quality jarred marinara and it really put La Bocce's to shame.   The caesar salad was disappointing as well. I expected a good caesar dressing, but I think it was straight out of a packet. (Correct me if that is incorrect, but that is the flavor I got from it) There was also so much of it that I couldn't even finish the salad. Every single piece of lettuce was drenched in the really creamy dressing.    I was so excited to try La Bocce yet came away very disappointed. Maybe I just ordered the wrong items or it could have been an off-night. Maybe I'll come back another time with better luck."}
{"text":"Yelp you have wrong information. You show they're open till 1am but went there at 1043pm and they were closed. Please update the times. Went way out of my way just to find it closed."}
{"text":"Awesome philly sub! Best ever! I will never choose another SUB place then this!!  The atmosphere in this small restaurant is absolutely fantastic and makes the food that much better!!"}
{"text":"I am a original gal from Buffalo and if anyone knows good pizza and wings when we taste it we do!  There is nothing like Buffalo food and as everyone knows the chicken wing originated there,  Friends from Buffalo that live here in Las Vegas turned me on to this place.  Guys from Buffalo own/run it and they are as friendly as can be.  The owner takes time to greet/chat with you and thanks you for patronizing his restaurant.  Not only did we sample the great pizza and wings which were very meaty and cooked to perfection we also ordered a \"Royal sub\", a Buffalo specialty consisting of a sausage patty, capicola and cheese.  Nobody in Vegas makes them correctly and my husband was thrilled with his.  The rolls are fresh and crusty, beef on weck another Buffalo specialty was just the way I remember it.  The owner purchases his bread/rolls from a LV baker originally from Buffalo.  The place is sparkling clean and I love their friendly attitude which I have not experienced in other pizzerias in this town.  They are onto something big,,,price, quality and service.  Its said you can't get all three but LaBocce is an exception."}
{"text":"Had the Italian grinder, wings, and calzone. This is one of very few sandwich shops that knows how to build a sandwich properly. Wings are served Buffalo NY style. Calzone was fresh and perfectly baked. Delicious food here. Must try."}
{"text":"Glad to have found this place on halalfare.com  Went there on Saturday with Mum & Son. The place was clean. Issa was at the cashier. He was very polite and attentive. Since it was our first time there, I was just excited to get HALAL food there. We ordered the meat lovers Calzone and their Philly Cheesesteak. It was delicious. We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Very good food! The owner and employees are very generous. Simple yet nice environment. Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I check this place out today I like the pepperoni pizza they have its very good I also tried the fish fry they have thats the 1 thats not so good so go check this place  if you want great Buffalo Pizza , but for great beer batter fish fry go somewhere else"}
{"text":"There seems to be new owners. The time before today, the pizza wasn't the same.  Today, I was told my large pepperoni pizza would be $32. When a manager (or owner?) came out, he said, \"why are you so angry?\" I grabbed my credit card & walked out! Where are the cool Italian guys that used to run the place? Everything has gone downhill - I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Great staff/owner. My delicious calzone took 20 minutes and came out piping hot with a crispy/flaky? crust on a ceramic plate. Divey feeling and located in a strip mall."}
{"text":"Atrocious service!  I placed an order on grubhub for pickup.  When I got to the restaurant the only guy working the counter was extremely rude telling me he didn't accept anything in a condescending tone and that I had to call grub hub and get my money back.  Avoid this place like the plague!"}
{"text":"This place is a little pizza sandwich place.  Not for a nice sit down dinner, but the food is great.    I have ordered the pizza and it is New York style, the Cannoli and Baklava is delish, the sandwiches are tasty, but simple.  They have Falafel, nice green fresh balls that are the best.  The hummus not so tasty.  I am always pleased by the results when I order any of the special menu items.   Be brave and go for the shish kabob or falafel instead."}
{"text":"Thank you yelp. We are in Vegas for a convention and we were looking for some good food to eat before we drove back to San Diego.   Everyone that ate here with me enjoyed there food. I got half a pastrami and half of a philly cheese steak. The philly was better then the pastrami. Also had some wings which where really good as well. My wife had the pasta with meatballs and liked it and my buddy and his wife both got calzones.   To some it up try this place out and give it a chance if you live in the area."}
{"text":"How this place has gone down in quality is really disappointing. I used to go here when I worked nearby and it was a tasty lunch spot. So when my husband wanted pizza, I suggested it. We used Eat24 and ordered a large pepperoni lover's pizza ($24 + $6 delivery) and when it arrived, it was lukewarm in the center and cold on the edges and there were a total of 16 pepperoni slices on it. Hardly what any reasonable person would call pepperoni lover's. We contacted the restaurant and relayed the issue to Alex who offered a free pizza in the future. Thanks, Alex, the offer is appreciated, but I doubt with the quality of the food that we received that we'll be taking you up on it."}
{"text":"Pizza was good.  Thin crust, not greasy at all.  Felt good about eating it where as some pizzas you feel sick afterwards & disappointed :D  I would recommend going for the pizza.  We also ordered wings - but there was no flavor to them.  We threw away more than half."}
{"text":"How do you disappoint 8 guys from Chicago? Order food from la bocce. How this place has 4 stars is beyond me. Wings and garlic bread were edible. Pizza was absolute trash. Don't even bother."}
{"text":"Honestly bummed. Read the great reviews and ordered delivery. But it's been over two hours and it's not here. When I called they never answered. Looks like I don't get to try the delicious pizza. :("}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a coworker and ordered the roast beef on weck which was very tasty but there was so little meat and so much bread I had to order more food when I was done. Coworker had the lunch special which was a small slice of pizza and a drink for $7 I believe. He also had to purchase more food and we are not very heavy eaters. Not to mention he was completely finished with his slice of pizza and cleaned up before my sandwich was given to me."}
{"text":"The hours listed are incorrect. I got to Las Vegas late at night and decided on La Bocce. Imagine my surprise when my Lyft driver pulled up and the restaurant was closed!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome . We came in on Saturday my wife had a Royal and myself the meatball sandwich which was out of this world. I recommend this to everyone and will bring my wife's family when they fly in from Buffalo. The owner was very nice and friendly and you felt at home"}
{"text":"I'm from the East Coast so when I see Cheese Steak out here, I like to try it.  Theirs was quite good, one of the best out west.  They just can't get the right bread here.  We also had a Calzone.  The cheese steak fed both of us and we had the calzone for lunch the next day; got a salad too. It's a small place, great for take out or they have tables.  Very friendly service too.  Pizza is Buffalo Style, not sure what that is but I'd try it for sure."}
{"text":"Omg. Their grilled chicken sub with jalapeños is BOMB! I always say I'm gonna try something else but end up getting the same thing lol also tried their spicy BBQ wings tonight with my sister and we devoured them! The guys there are always so sweet and offer free water while I wait for my freshly prepared food. Two thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"We have only ordered delivery from La Bocce so my feedback is limited. We enjoyed their fried mushrooms; we also ordered ravioli with extra meatballs (there weren't any meatballs), and spaghetti with sausage. The pasta sauce is acceptable, almost like it's made to appeal to everyone. So a little on the bland side but nothing to complain about. We also got the chef's salad which was good. Fresh veggies, meat, etc. The meals did not come with sides of bread or anything, but the food came pretty quick and hot and overall it was pretty good. I'd give 3.5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"good food good service!! we came to vegas for CES. some of our friends recommended this place! you wont regret at all. good quality good thanks"}
{"text":"Great food, they really go the extra mile to make you feel special and will even consider preparing meals not on their menu..check it out.. Bryant"}
{"text":"Got charged 5$ for some bland ranch and marinara . Save your money folks... This is possibly the worst tasting marinara and ranch in history... No flavor at all. So disappointing. Pizza is a solid 3."}
{"text":"Just ok sauce is very bland.  The pizza sub wasn't that good according to one person in our party.   The ravioli was like it was frozen, with canned sauce.   The service was good which is the only reason for two stars."}
{"text":"Please don't get fooled by all these GOOD FAKE reviews! First thing you notice when you walk in to the place is all the ITALIAN culture reference \"ITALIAN FLAG, PICTURES..ETC\", BUT OWNERS AARE ARABS! how, someone should explain lmfao!!! I went there for dinner around 8 PM, the place is empty...no one inside. Sat down, looked at the menu, \"by the way\" their menu is small and not good, ordered spaghetti with meat balls and 1/2 steak and cheese sub \"Italian restaurants do not and should not have steak and cheese\" lol. So, the guys automatically gets me the full steak and cheese sandwich \" which I didn't ordered\", but whatever, first think I notice, the spaghetti is way too thick, sauce was sooo little and not enough and here's the disgusting thing! Meatballs are boild, not cooked in the sauce, taste like \"shit\"! Steak and cheese sub was not good at all! The meat taste weird and as if it was forzen. The owners has nothing to do with italian food. Why, because I'm Italian and know my country food and how it tatse. What a shame :(. Their friends and family are probably logging in to yelp to write 'good' reviews to fool customers. NEVER GO THERE AGAIN. BY THE WAY, the owners are from Jordan. What the heck are they doing with italian food, I have no idea. Don't waste your time & $$$ please. Thakns"}
{"text":"This place is near the rental car center for the Las Vegas airport. They have surprisingly good sandwiches. We went twice: when we picked up and dropped off the car.  Apparently the owner is from Buffalo, NY, and it shows in his tasty east-coast style sandwiches. He is friendly, too.  My turkey club had turkey, turkey bacon, oil & vinegar, lettuce, tomato, cheese, oregano, and mayo on an excellent toasted sesame roll. It was sooo good--better than I expected from this unassuming place.   The chicken parm sandwich had too much cheese, but other than that, it was good. The gyro wrap was lacking a bit in the meat. Fries were good, though!! I'd stick to the deli-style sandwiches."}
{"text":"For a neighborhood eatry this is awesome. Amazing customer service , fresh food and reasonable prices. Had chicken finger and loved it . I will surely revisit"}
{"text":"This place was awful. Bottom of the pie was burnt. Sauce and cheese had no flavor. Tasted like I was eating nothing. Will give them a couple of weeks to get their act together, then try them again. First impression: not impressed at all."}
{"text":"Great buffalo wings and pizza. Also seen some great subs come out on true Italian hoggie rolls. If your from Buffalo come and support a new local business."}
{"text":"Greatful to have such a delicious halal spot in the neighborhood. They're prompt when you pick up and always hot. My only suggestion would be add more pepperoni and sausage when people ask for extra :). Delicious pizza though!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Close to the airport. Serve halal food. We went twice during our visit and really enjoyed it both times. The bread for the sub sandwiches is great. Nice service as well."}
{"text":"Any place that has a Mortal Kombat Arcade in Free Play mode is alright in my book.  The pizza is good too!"}
{"text":"very mean people and no parking .  no ice for drinks.  Looks more like a meeting house than a restaurant . Shopping center it is in is weird.  Pizza is raw."}
{"text":"I'm sure the pizza is great but HOLY COW the falafel and lentil soup was amazing! No frills interior but really good Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"Every time I come down here we always get greeted by a warm welcome. The owner works the register half the time and make sure our food is taken care of. I always get something in the lunch menu which is decently priced and has good variety of food choices. Its one of our favorite quick lunch break locations near the office and we never leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Over priced sandwiches, stingy with the toppings, and complete disregard for the customer. We were at the outlets on our way out of town and decided to grab a bite to eat before the 4 hour drive back to So Cal. I love a great italian sub and yelp had this place listed as 4 stars and only one $. Hubby got the Philly cheesesteak and I got the Italian. The italian was great, thinly sliced toppings, toasted sesame bun but it came out a good 5 to 10 minutes before the cheesesteak did.  $11 for a thin albeit tasty sandwich. When we finally got the cheesesteak the meat looked like old reheated meat and was so overcooked you couldn't even see the onions and peppers anymore because they were so cooked down. It also had a pathetic amount of cheese on it and was very bland. I decide to reach for the parmesan cheese on the table to add some flavor only to unload an excessive amount of GARLIC powder all over the sandwich. Who keeps garlic powder, UNLABELED, next to red pepper flakes at an Italian food place??? When I ask if they will kindly remake the sandwich the owner plays dumb and tries to charge me for it saying I should have asked him for parmesan. He makes no apology and proceeds to say he's an employee and why should he pay for my sandwich? Then sits down to eat his dinner along with 3 other people at a table....what kind of employee eats his dinner on the job?? We spent $24 for bad customer service and only one good sandwich. Thanks a lot. Save yourself some money and go where your business will be treated with respect and appreciation."}
{"text":"I ordered pizza online for delivery with Yelp Eat 24 and first I get a call telling me they have an established 2 hour wait time and therefore I need to cancel my order, then 10 minutes later this place called and said if I order my food online and not directly through them they will only accept cash, that if I wanted to use a credit card I needed to cancel my order with the online company and call them directly to use my credit card.  I asked about the first call, that question was ignored and he repeated the same thing, cancel your online order and call us directly.  I've used this place several times but no more.  Two different stories and they didn't want to honor Yelp Eat 24???  Not only did this place just loose an order but they just lost a customer.  I ordered from another place down the street online and had my food within an hour."}
{"text":"A little on the expensive side but they have great pepperoni pizza. Close to where my roommate works and the freeway so its definitely convenient. Only thing that bothered me was both times I have gone there is always a group of women standing around outside... Makes you wonder."}
{"text":"They have this family deal that comes with salad, garlic bread, pizza, pasta or lasagna for like 30 bucks. The joint is family owned and the workers are nice! The pizza was really really good!"}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp, we found this little gem in the desert. We were looking for an inexpensive Italian place for lunch - which is not particularly easy in this part of town. It doesn't look like much from the outside, so we were initially hesitant, but the owner (we're assuming) was very nice, and the menu had a nice variety of options. So we went for it, and we were not disappointed! The pizza was awesome, with just the right amount of balance between cheese and sauce. Same with the individual calzone (which was pretty large for one individual!) The small salad was also quite large, and full of fresh ingredients. The cheese ravioli was a huge portion of cheesy goodness! Needless to say, we will be back! Soon!"}
{"text":"Very homey, friendly staff, clean restroom and really good food. I tried the Philly cheesesteak."}
{"text":"Awesome fresh ingredients.   Try the Calzones. Made fresh.   To die for.  Fresh cheeses, pepperini, peppers, Canadian bacon, sausage, mushrooms and Marinara sauce."}
{"text":"I was in Las Vegas for the weekend and decided to try out this place. I'm really glad that I did because I had two absolutely fantastic meals here. I had the Philly Cheese Steak which was sumptuous. Then, just before leaving Las Vegas, I went and had the Chef's recommended Grilled Chicken Sandwich which was made extra peppery upon my request. It tasted heavenly. The chicken was done perfectly and the sauces took the taste to a whole new level. The sandwich bread was fresh and soft as well.  It's quite possible these were the best two sandwiches I've had in the recent as well as distant past.   Whenever I'm in Las Vegas again, I'm definitely going to go to La Bocce to try out their other stuff in addition to the sandwiches."}
{"text":"Okay, others have talked about the pizza and some of the other items there. The pizza is really really good, the calzones are amazing, their salads are great, awesome vinaigrette dressing. I noticed their Antipasto Salad was $14.00 and thought, \"Well, this better be a damn good salad for $14\". Well, when I got it, it was actually two full size salads, both well worth more than the $7 a piece.   The thing I really want to talk about though, is the wings. Man the wings are amazing! The owner is from Buffalo, and it shows. I had almost given up hope on finding good wings in Vegas. I've lived here for 5 years, and even the best places for wings that I'd tried prior to this fell short in one way or another from the amazing wings I'm used to back home on the east coast. Also, a lot of places where I even found \"ok\" wings, I'd go back a few weeks later and they'd change them. They'd all of a sudden be breaded or something.  Here is the list of stuff that automatically makes chicken wings a fail: 1. Breaded - There is literally NO reason to bread wings! If they are cooked right, the skin will be plenty crispy on their own without needing help from your crap ass breading.  2. Poor Quality chicken or small wings - When you finish eating a wing, the bone should be a pearlish white, not black, not purple with blood because they weren't cooked long enough. They shouldn't be the size of a golf pencil. 3. Old oil - I don't want my wings tasting like burnt fries/cheese sticks. Change your f***ing oil!!!!  4. Improper oil temp/cook time - Wings aren't supposed to be all watery. Get that skin crispy, or get that garbage out of my face. 5. Bad Sauce - Frank's red hot mixed with butter is not wing sauce! You make that **** yourself or you don't make it at all. 6. No Blue Cheese - Even if you don't like blue cheese, trust me when I say this, if a place only offers ranch with their wings, they don't take them seriously. Run! Run!!!!  LaBocce is the first place I've had in Vegas that hit absolutely 100% every one of these marks. Don't wait. Go now. Now!!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at La Bocce. Went here for lunch. My husband and I shared the pizza lunch special and the pastrami sub. The portions are huge! We took home half of the sandwich and we both extremely full! The pizza was wonderful! The crust was crunchy on the bottom and soft in the middle just how I like it and it had plenty of cheese and pepperoni. The pastrami was crisp on the edges and the sub roll was also great. Tasted like it was just baked! They were also soooo friendly! They made us feel so welcome. This is my new favorite place and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The Assorted Italian sub is absolutely outstanding. I've eaten here on two occasions and the sandwich was perfect both times.  Warm, crispy bread and tasty meats; it's a great sub. The owner even opened early to make my lunch today.  Can't ask for much more than that!"}
{"text":"The best pizza Ever! My kids are pick with their pizza but this one they love it! Their favorite! Much better than Brick oven, etc. The crust is amazing! You can taste the fresh ingredients. Every time we came back to Vegas we're going to eat there."}
{"text":"It took the delivery driver 3 times to get my order right and then I was overcharged. French fries were soggy and the chicken wings were dry. Ordered 2 gyros which I finally received on their 3rd try to get my order correct. It had very little meat and the pita bread was burned. I would not advise ordering from this place. Maybe walking in you can at least examine your food. Maybe other things taste better but the wings, fries and gyros would not be something I would ever order. In fact, I'll pass on this place and you should too.  Good luck."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. Ate there 3 times, the sandwiches I ordered were always burnt. The 2 slices I ordered were just cheese slices that they slapped meat & pepperoni on top & \"heated\" it for 30 seconds & hoped I would be happy with that. Pretty rude staff as well... There are plenty of better places in that neighborhood..."}
{"text":"There food was horrible. The pizza was tough and when I got the garden salad, it was a bunch of unwashed lettuce and 2 slices of onion and tomato. They left out the mushrooms, olives, peppers n whatever else I paid for."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped here to grab a bite to eat before we hit the road towards Utah. We enjoyed the hot wings, calzones, and sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Came here to get some pizza after my daughter insisted on having pizza for dinner.  We kind of chose this place at random because of yelp reviews. It was a good choice.   We ordered a medium pepperoni lovers and a small garden salad. My wife loved the salad and my daughter killed the pizza. Next time I'll have to order more food."}
{"text":"Reasonably good pizza. Not really New York, lacks good sauce. Definitely fine for late night delivery! The Philly cheesesteak wasn't bad, although we'd intended to get the pizza and not the sandwich; an honest mistake. I should have gotten it spicy though. They deliver all over, when to the GrandView, where we were staying. Great option for after midnight during the week!"}
{"text":"There's alot to like about La Bocce. It's super close to the rental car center. It's got a Mortal Kombat arcade machine (free play). It's got the ambiance of a back-east pizza joint, complete with mob movie characters on the wall. It's clean, the owners are usually around. And it's got pretty good pizza. They nailed the crust, it's thin, crunchy and legit. The cheese is solid. But there's something in the sauce that doesn't quite jive with the usual taste profile. This is nit picking tho if you get off the plane, get your rental car, and want a quick slice, you aren't going to do better than La Bocce."}
{"text":"Tired of the chain restaurants in Las Vegas? If so, you must try La Bocce, located at the corner of Warm Springs and Placid, in the south part of the Las Vegas valley. Conveniently located near I-215 and McCarran Airport. The owners are some really nice guys who know how to cook and sincerely appreciate your business. They have a large menu, and everything that we have tried is delicious. Being Chicago area transplants, we love the old fashioned Mom and Pop places, and this place fits the bill perfectly. Their Italian Beef sandwich is served on the best rolls you will find in our area. It's generously filled with Vienna beef, served with giardiniara and au jus. Seriously so delicious. Depending on your appetite, they have small and large sandwiches. They have a good Philly Cheese steak, Chicken Parmesan sandwich, Chicago style hotdogs, etc. They also serve New York style pizza and excellent homemade calzones. Please give this establishment a try. They are such pleasant, hardworking guys, and your tummy will thank you."}
{"text":"Went with a group that were born in Buffalo and had a great time talking to the owners and sampling a lot of the food.  The Onion Petals were very tasty and a good starter while we waited.  The \"Royal\" sub was very good and very different.  My friends really enjoyed this sub from Buffalo.  The meatball sub was tasty on its tasted roll and the this was very good too. The owner had just gotten some fresh chicken wings in and they were some of the best I have had in a long time.  They have only been open a few weeks, in this old Bono's location, but the food in right on for at casual lunch or dinner.  My friends from Buffalo said this really brought back some great food memories of their home town.  Stop by and give them a try."}
{"text":"We really loved everything here. Our server was very polite and made great recommendations. We had the Philly cheese and grilled chicken sub. The \"full\" subs are huge and were delicious! Everything was very fresh!  Nice to know there is a halal pizza and sub place near the airport! Will defiantly recommend/return. Ask for their off the menu spicy falafel. Very Spicy  and delicious. There website says \"a bucket\" of wings is 50 wings. On our take out order of \"1/2 bucket\" we only got 13 wings. The wings were tiny but tasty."}
{"text":"I would give more stars if I could.  Clean place. Excellent service. Delicious pizza and chicken strips were fresh. Must try."}
{"text":"A good friend brought me to la bocce for lunch. I live in California and I thought we had good halal spots. But this place sets a high standard compared to some Cali spots. The owner is very humble and his crew cooks very good, The meat is seasonsed well, and is cooked to tenderous perfection. The portion sizes are great for the price, no complaints at all, this is definitely on my top eatery spots in vegas"}
{"text":"Very friendly and helpful. This was our first time eating here while on vacation, but this will be our go to pizza place when in Vegas.  Pizza is very tasty, and big slices"}
