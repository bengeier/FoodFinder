{"text":"Fireside has awesome food. The breakfast burrito is huge and delicious. Recently had their version of steak fries which was very, very good. A bed of fries, provolone, thin slices of marinated steak and some kind of amazing gravy that brings it all together. Big enough to share.

Place never closes, lots of TV's and a really good beer selection. One of the few places in town that has Delirium Tremens on tap. 

Sit at the bar and you should gamble otherwise grab a table or relax by the fire in their lounge chairs."}
{"text":"This place has great food!  I usually go here just for the chicken and avocado salad.  But the customer service has been very poor every time I go.  It always appears that the service staff is bothered by  a phone order.  The service also seems very disorganized, with one person able to handle the take out orders.  Love, love, love the food, but I have always been disappointed in the customer service.  Go to Remedys across the street - they have both!!  Good food and good service!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this bar! The food is always delicious- eat in or to-go. The bartenders are awesome! Kele, Brett, Rob, Shaun, Kate & Jess. I couldn't ask for a better neighborhood bar close to my house!!! Love it! Thanks guys for always being awesome. Plus they have a great selection of craft beers..."}
{"text":"I live right down the street from this place, so we decided to try it out and hopefully make it our new favorite spot to eat. We came in on a Friday night around 6pm for a late night snack and it was empty...no one greeted us so we awkwardly sat in a booth by the bar. After about 5 minutes someone greeted us and took our drink order. We ordered the pickle chips and seared ahi. IT WAS TERRIBLE! I was amazed they could screw up fried pickles! But they tasted frozen and soggy! My boyfriend ordered the seared ahi which was for sure frozen, and it was so tiny! Literally 2 bites and gone...so he sends and we pay our check and get out as fast as we could. I mean I live so close that I'm sure we'll try it out one more time, but if they strike out again we won't be back and the only reason we will be back is because our waiter scored some points when we asked to send the food back."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite bars in Henderson. It's my go-to bar based mostly on the attentive and always fun bartenders. All the food I've tried has been great, it's almost always a really nice crowd, I've never had bad service and I'm quite sure it won't change as long as they keep their awesome bar staff. It's quite dark inside but I can deal with that, music is never incredibly loud either which is good. Overall I'd say if you're looking for a nice chill night at the bar, this is your place. Keep it up Fireside! Justin, Jessy, and Brett are some awesome bartenders if you get the chance to meet them!"}
{"text":"This was our second time there.  We vowed the first time to never come back, but came back only because one of friends likes this place.  (He needs to be shown around town a little and see you can only do better). Our second time here we experienced the exact same things as our first time.  My wife gambled on a poker machine and I gambled on another.  Together we blew at least $200 through the two machines.  The first $15 we tipped we were pretty much given the stink eye until the bartender(s) warmed up to giving us drinks.  My wife never got a clean glass they just re-used her old glass.  After dropping $200 we asked for the bill.  The bartender said she comped what she could.  My wife had not a single drink comped. I can drink pretty heavily, but a 12 pack costs $18 (for the expensive stuff) retail.  So after $200 they couldn't comp the beer I had.  I asked the bartender why this was.  How do they compete with anyone else in the Las Vegas valley?  I was told that you pay a premium for beer here because in the fridge they have some beers that are worth a couple hundred dollars.  So, because you get to look at expensive beers in the fridge you pay a $20 premium on your Coors light.  Another reason was because they can't compete with any of the big casinos.  Which makes me think if you have a customer who drops a few hundred dollars you can't make a profit off handing him or her a few beers?  Also, someone told me the Fireside is owned by the same people who own the Elixir on green valley and sunset, which we used to go to all the time when we lived on that side of town.  Always had the drinks comped when you played continuesly.  The waiting staff is super friendly (at Elixir).  So not sure why Fireside is different.  The food is descent.   The only reason I went there a second time is because my friend feels it's his local bar, but if you're going to drop a few hundred plus, the entire valley is your neighborhood bar with only a cheap cab ride away.  Everywhere in Las Vegas .... Literally everywhere with the exception of many places on the strip they will treat you right when you drop a few bills.  This place ... Awe full,  go for the food and just pay for the drinks if you must, but nothing special here!"}
{"text":"Good Fish tacos, fish chips, burgers and pizza, a lot of good craft beer on tap and bottled. friendly staff. The beer menu is a challenge to read from the tv screen and if you eat in the bar area the smoke can be a little issue. But hey, its a bar..bars have smoke. The dinning room is smoke free."}
{"text":"This place sucks!!!! Very rude waitress and bartender. These  women give customer service a bad name. I'm in customer service and I have never seen such rudeness, if they worked for me I would of fired them on the spot. Shame on the owners of FireSide on CACTUS & SPENCER!!!!"}
{"text":"The only thing that sucks about Fireside is the smoke. The food and beer selection is good. They should vamp up the place. A lot of older people go there."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! It has a warm atmosphere reminiscent of it's name with it's dark tables. There is even a separate room that is clearly supposed to be a cozy library with a lovely fireplace. The food is very good and very reasonably priced! They have the Best fried Dill Pickle Chips I have ever tasted! I highly recommend Fireside!"}
{"text":"\"Kate of the Fireside\" is an exquisite mammal. She brings to mind my favorite Beatles songs, Skakespearian quotes, and sunsets. We shared one wonderful Monday, before noon, over a number of tasty José Cuervo shots. It reminded me of a younger Vegas, Sammy Davis's Vegas. 
Kate, your sumptuous smile brings me much joy. If I were Methamphetamine, you would be my Walter White. 
If you are reading this review, call in my-grandmother-died and treat yourself to a little piece of verbal S&M. Have yourself an expensive beer, and enjoy the gambling. Unless you're chicken, \"Mcfly!\"

{"text":"For being a local hang out,  this place has the coldest draft beer around and the nachos and wings  aren't too shabby either...  Unfortunately this place has the MOST unfriendliest waitresses around. The minute you step in you are greeted by  a long face gal that can just sour the rest of your nite."}
{"text":"I have to have a cheeseburger from Fireside at least once every other week. I believe they are wood-fired. The fries are awesome! Plus, Great beers on tap."}
{"text":"Fireside is the best bar in the valley.  The bartenders are professionals and their food and beer selection is on target.  For the vast selection of craft beers, they really don't charge that much.  Just a great bar!"}
{"text":"Great beer tab and they get some rare inventory sometimes! The food is good and the atmosphere is a great time to hangout with friends or family!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite bar in the city!!! I love the live music sat. Night's!! The food is awesome and the bartenders are super friendly. The beer selection on draft is amazing to say the least! Strongly suggest  it! The restaurant Is awesome and 
offers outdoor seating. Try the chili or pepperstami !"}
{"text":"Ah the Fireside... How I want to love you so much more... I've come here quite a few times because I live in the area.  
The food is pretty good, (cheesy barrels are fantastic) the craft beer selection is Awesome, the staff is friendly... Why would I only give 3 stars?...

Well, the inherit problem that I've seen falls on management.  
-  Every time I come in and ask for a list of beers I get the same answer from the staff, \"It changes every week, so I don't know what we have.. you can walk around and look at the tap handles...\"    WHAT?  You go through this trouble to bring in great beers like Ballast Point and New Belgium, and you can't even spend the 5 minutes to type up and print out what is on tap for the week?  Why can other bars accomplish this task? Every staff member should be given this list, asked to remember it, and I will give you 5 stars immediately.

-   Another reason that most likely contributes to not knowing what is behind the bar, is that, one can not actually see the bar..  It is so dark in this place (granted that's not always a bad thing) but you need to put lights over your bar showcasing all of the liquor bottles you have so you can sell the stuff!  I can't even see the bartender as they disappear into \"the Abyss\" of darkness.

I will come back to this place again because the staff does do a pretty good job.  Just please get the beer menu out, and hang some lights over the bartenders and bring the food prices down a notch.

-FD

UPDATE: 7/15/13

They've added a draft list television over the kitchen, which helps to see what beers are in... but it isn't up to date usually.  Still, an improvement which bumps then to the 4 Star range."}
{"text":"Great Turkey avocado burger made here and yummy cheesy Tator tots! Good service. Good Craft beer selection. Close to home. What's not to like!"}
{"text":"Met friends on a Sunday evening. I was very surprised at the menu, like other reviewers, I expected just another tavern. BF had the T-bone, huge portion and he loved it! I had to leave after an appetizer, due to scheduling, but the party of 6 stayed for hours! Only thing missing, only one Cider option. Attention management: Apple ciders are all the rage, and a good option for ladies that don't care for beer. You get the gents in with all your beers, but keep us girls happy too!"}
{"text":"2 bar tenders you should know of, Patrick and Justin......I'm sorry, pattycakes and Justine! Don't forget. These guys will hook you up, get you wasted, get you laid, maybe even a massage if you play your cards right ;). The food is awesome, even the late night menu. Ill haunt you if you don't go. 

The ambiance is awesome and the decor is good. They don't have darts or a pool table but that doesn't matter the bartenders will keep you entertained enough and if you're gambler like me you will be on machine tryin to win that cash money!! 

They have an insane beer selection, bottles and taps. Constantly rotating seasonal IPAs, saisons, hefs, and the standard light little panoche beers. If you like to drink THIS IS YOUR BAR. 

This is hands down one of my favorite bars and me and boyfriend dine here often and have hit MULTIPLE five spot. If you come on the weeks days you might catch the Dos Equis guy. He will be the creepy under the tv. 

WE LOVE FIRESIDE!!!!"}
{"text":"Hit it on a slow night but still worth every quite minute. Food was awesome. Bar tender was great. Environment was perfect, not to loud and not to many people."}
{"text":"5 stars. Great service , great food. Double bacon avocado sandwich, nachos, and their pasta with shrimp, chicken and sausage, are some favorites. BTW-Rob is the best !!"}
{"text":"Well after reading the other reviews I feel like I went to an amusement park and missed half the rides...maybe I was too in the football zone to notice the craft beer heaven this place apparently is! I feel a little dirty for drinking Bud Light each time I've visited....but anyway...

This has become our new Sunday destination for football after a long allegiance to Rocky's (old Timbers, still a great place) up the street. Fireside just has a better ambience and bonus, I might not have to have a lung transplant at 40 by coming here instead. You won't miss an NFL game here and really, isn't that what Sunday is all about? 2 massive projection screens, numerous big flat screens and the red zone channel always found somewhere in between, your eyeballs won't miss one reception, kick or penalty. 

The staff is awesome, particularly the bartender Chris, who is attentive and dishes just the right amount of abuse, always welcomed in a sports bar. I've only seen the tip of the iceburg as far as food is concerned but so far so good. The football specials are a page long and I had the Buffalo Chicken Sliders. They satisfied my ever raging buffalo sauce addiction in every way. They even have a grilled cheese with mozzarella sticks shoved in between....that is a real thing, cheese lovers. Breakfast also looked tasty, my BF got french toast that was fluffy and smelled great.

I had to share how amazing this place was but hey...don't try to change my Giants game if you go. :-)"}
{"text":"CHEESY TOTS!!! Honestly, I've never had an item on the menu that I didn't absolutely love. I have been to this location plenty of times, normally for dinner, and late night. Rob, Kele, Brett and Shaun are all phenomenal. I've read through some of the lower \"star'd\" reviews....those people all must have woken up on the wrong side of the bed. I have never had a bad experience here. Please don't change a thing!!!"}
{"text":"I've heard some great things about this place but was honestly a bit disappointed. Their staff was absolutely great, but their food options were very limited. I could barely even stomach the spinach dip. I would recommend this place for drinks with some friends, but id say avoid it if you're planning on eating. I will be back, but I will be sure to eat beforehand!"}
{"text":"Thanks Maggie for a Great Service.  We were a group of 4 and loved the atomposhere, the drinks, the food and ofcourse the service.  A+++.  

Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to have breakfast. Sat there fir 15 minutes while the bartender socialized with a couple at the other end of the bar. Guess I'll grab a bite somewhere else."}
{"text":"Nice place from the outside. When you walk in it's dark and has usual smell of smoke from the bar area. We went to look for seats toward the back near the kitchen but kinda just stood there discussing where we were gonna sit since the bar space was mostly taken. After a few moments the bar tender greeted us and then directed us to the seating area (nice big oversized couches near TV) and we were told a server was present and would come see us. After a few minutes bartender came and got out drink order stating she didn't know where server went. We asked about happy hour pricing ( we went there based on the websites 4-6pm offers) to our surprise we were told no happy hour existed. Interesting. So once the server did come around we said we would need a minute and kept the menus. 

No. One. Came. Back. After our 1 drink we got up and we were then asked if we needed anything else like more drinks... we said no we are leaving and the server said okay she ll close you out. At the bar the bartender said oh she didn't close you out? Then they had a small discussion about it and finally we got our check of $10.50. 

Probably the worst service I've gotten since TGIF on Sahara in 2010."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times, but service is always great. The reason I'm writing this review is bc of the calzone. 5 star review worthy!! Wings are also great, and I've also had a few beers here. They added wet naps to the takeout and tons of sauce.. It's the little things :,)"}
{"text":"Justin is the best! He always remembers me and my boyfriend whenever we come in and takes really good care of us. We only go to fireside when we are celebrating something special. That's how awesome the service and food is."}
{"text":"Awesome bartenders!  I once watched the chef clean the kitchen and was in shock!  He cleaned the all the way up to the ceiling.  I trust their food for a bar because of their cleanliness.  The chili ans lot stickers are two of the best dishes im Vegas believe it or not!  And I am picky on bar food and a huge fine dining foodie."}
{"text":"I've been here for lunch a couple times in the past with clients and most recently for Sunday football. Service is usually pretty good, especially when you have a few people with you regularly ordering drinks and apps. One of my favorites to get is their Mozzarella String Cheese Sandwich. Just what it sounds like...mozzarella string cheese melted between 2 pieces of bread. It's great and helps soak up some beer during the game."}
{"text":"We went in after a concert to have drinks and dinner. We sat down the waitress came over and we asked for a drink menu . The drink menu is on a screen that my husband had to go up to see what was on it. I guess they save money not having to print a menu. Then we asked for the dinner menue she only brought us one. I guess another way to save money. One menu per table.  Needless to say we did not eat there.Although the drinks wine and beer were very reasonable."}
{"text":"I don't visit many bars or taverns, but I've come to like this place. Nice relaxed atmosphere, great staff, and a damn good burger. Out of all the things I've had here the burger has been the best. I didn't know they have but once I learned they had jalapeño bacon I've had it on every burger and highly recommend it. I also seem to have maggie as my server and she's super nice and prompt. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT food and customer service at this cozy spot on ST. Rose/ Spencer!   When we go in we try something new on the menu and it has met my expectations.  French Dip is my favorite and beers selections are great!   
What a fun atmosphere, and my favorite bartender ED on graveyard who has the best customer service! Thank you ED! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Went in to have some drinks and gamble last night . We asked the bartender Sean not sure if I spelled his name right he was a bigger guy . He said he had more important things to do with an attitude!!!!! We will never go here again we will gamble and eat elsewhere . What an asshole !!!! What kind of bartender treats gamblers like this ???!!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I walked into the establishment and no one said a word to us we found a table sat down, all we got were stares, no menu, waited about 5 mins and decided to leave, will not be coming here again"}
{"text":"Decor is pretty cool and beer selection is impressive. The food on the other hand was super disappointing. I don't mind paying for good food but what they deliver wasn't even close to worth what they charge. Charging more than $10 for a SUPER dry small Reuben with 8 tator tots was a ripoff. All appetizers being $10 stifled my order."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place since they were offering some specials we received in the mail.  When we got there, they were not doing one of the specials and were out of ribs and chicken at 7:00 pm with only two other patrons in the place.  The waitress was friendly but couldn't tell us what beer was available.  Apparently, a drink menu was replaced by a monitor near the bar.  We had to walk through the servers area to find out what they had.   We ordered a steak sandwich that came on dried bread and fish and chips that obviously went from the freezer into the fryer.  If you're looking for average bar food for a football game, the place might be OK but not a place I would go to again for a fine dining experience."}
{"text":"Very shocked in a bad way with workers here, my first time came in gambled bartender was horrible rude since I walked in , about to quit and walk out attitude  he asked what do I want to drink very ill-mannered, I told him.... played my game and after getting so annoyed as well as a guy next to me I just wanted to leave. Cashed out and he was rude as to abruptly say to me my drink was 10bucks I yet gambled 70bucks (still scratching head here) for this place looking more nice then most ordinary  bars inside I will never ever return here very rude, pushy, impolite and demanding, horrible to try and even be nice to them here.  I do not know about there food service and would never give a chance to see there are plenty of bars very close that Welcome your company.

Maybe they should check who they hire cause I have never seen this before that bad.
Hope I helped someone with this so they don't waste there time, sorry :("}
{"text":"Oh my...what has happened to this place?
Food was terrible! One bite and I sent my food back! The service needs a major attitude adjustment. Is the bar still open because of the gaming!? Never again."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying we really enjoy this place for breakfast. Service is always good and food is basic but really good. Bloody Mary's are good too if this review were for breakfast only it would get at least four stars. And the only thing saving this review from two stars is the service. 
We went for dinner and it was TERRIBLE. I ordered flatbread with artichoke hearts and Caesar and my husband ordered a burger. The flatbread was covered with canned artichoke hearts. The brine from the artichokes made it so vinegary that I couldn't eat over half of it. The burger was served medium well and something was moldy about half way thru-bread? Cheese? Meat? Also inedible. Server was nice and efficient however clearly had no authority to make things right. It's not cheap either-$53 for two entrees, two beers and one house cocktail."}
{"text":"I went here with some work friends for dinner. Its located right behind the Shell gas station by Seven Hills and Easter. It could be hard to find. When we walked on Saturday night, the place was pretty empty, even the bar. We got a table for us and the waitress was very friendly. It was her second day on the job, but she was knew every single item on the menu. She was recommended drinks and food items based on our preferences. And we were not disappointed; the food here is excellent.  Sandwiches, burgers and desserts are very flavorful and the presentation is pretty good.

I ended up getting their french dip sandwich, with roast beef. The au jus sauce was amazing. I ordered the sandwich with chedder munchers. They were so good that my friends ended up eating alot of my chedder munchers. They enjoyed their food as well.  Its always a good sign when people are sharing food, because they think that its the best they've had in a while. 

Overall, I love this place. If I am craving french dip I know where to go in Henderson. I would highly recommend this place if you are looking to try a quite place for any type of occasion."}
{"text":"We have eaten here many times. I would say that we order the chicken avocado salad at least 80% of the time. We came with friends, and all four of us ended up ordering the same salad. It may seem a little boring to get the same dish every time you go to a restaurant. However, this salad is so good that it's almost criminal to order anything else here. The salad is huge. It has a very generous portion of sliced chicken breast, avocado, tomatoes, small pieces of candied nuts providing some crunch, and iceberg lettuce. Delish! The service has been consistently excellent. And the price is reasonable, making this an excellent value."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and the food is usually ok.  Nothing to write home about.  We got the pretzel bites and there was enough salt on them to bloat a kidney.  

The service the last time we were there was just horrible. So bad that a few ladies at the table next to us left in the middle of their meal. Their exit was a little dramatic but warranted nonetheless.

I'm sure we'll give it another try but so far, not a fan."}
{"text":"So the bartender said I was rude for asking for a drink. Tuesday from 9pm on. I was never rude and still tipped on my tab after the fact. Will never go in there again. The service was horrible and the bartenders are of thin skin. Worst place to go in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The beer selection is awesome. Chris knows beer and so does his bartenders. The food is different but GREAT. I really like the variety. I come here enough to know the bartenders and they always have time to chat. 5 stars"}
{"text":"Very nice place and great for sports. The bartender Chris was awesome and they have all the football games on plus $1 beers on Sunday AND awesome deals on food! Will definitely hit up this place again when in LV. Only about 10 miles south of the strip too off 15 fwy so if you're driving back to CA on Sunday this is definitely the place to stop to watch the games before heading home."}
{"text":"Was craving steak and fries as a midnight snack. Called in an order to be picked up and I was told that it was $17.99 Come to find out they advertise it as $11.99 on their menu when you search them on Google. I can't stand the deceit. I'm surprised this establishment is still up and running. After looking at previous reviews from other yelpers I can see why the rating is lower than I would have expected. My food was good, but definitely not worth the amount I paid. A $17.99 price point would make sense if it was an actual strip steak or something with steak fries. I was overcharged for sure. Not sure if I will this place another try."}
{"text":"Prices are a bit high out here, but bartender assured me that they have restaurant quality food here. Some of the choices were unique and I ended up with the Turkey Jo. This had thin sliced roasted turkey drenched in way too much tangy BBQ sauce, but was loaded with carmelized onions and then topped with a small scoop of cole slaw. Sandwich was too soggy, despite the toasted bread. Some strange side dish which was like fried mac and cheese almost. Unusual, but not that great. Plenty of beer choices and mostly locals here make this place a decent option if your in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"They have a wide variety of microbrews and good food. My favorite is the pepperstromi with cheesy tots. My only complaint is they keep the bar dark."}
{"text":"I didn't eat here but my friends did but I came in and played some Video Poker.
The place is pretty standard for locals to hangout with a bar area and restaurant area.
Justin I believe was pretty nice guy and I would say this place seems pretty chill to go to.
After hours they have to buzz you in.
Only thing is when you do a Drive to Directions from Yelp and some other maps it brings you to a residential area!  Crazy we were in front of someones home because of the GPS!"}
{"text":"This is a great little spot. In fact, it is the best spot in my neighborhood for a good, quality beer. I love that they have so many unique and awesome beer offerings. Plus, it is small with a nice ambiance. The bartenders are very friendly and attentive. And the food ain't bad either. Definitely a new favorite neighborhood hang out for me."}
{"text":"The chicken and avocado sandwich is to die for! And my bartender suggested a fantastic craft beer that I wouldn't have gotten in Atlanta. This place is worth the stop!"}
{"text":"The food was sooooo nasty the chicken was dry the service was great until the shift.. it had no flavor at all I wouldn't recommend it to a dog.. and the are overpriced. ."}
{"text":"Perfect place. Comparing service to the Strip Restaurants, not quite there, but miles ahead most local bars. Food was great, and I have been told is all fresh, made in-house daily including sauces, dips and dressings. Excellent beer selection, on draft, and perfect serving temperature. Steaks are best in town. Always clean."}
{"text":"This place must not want customers. My husband and I took out grandson out for dinner, they would not seat us because he ( grandson) was not 21.  So again my husband and I go alone, only to be told by the barmaid to seat ourself.  We did waited and waited no one came to give us a menu or water. We left. NEVER TO RETURN"}
{"text":"The one and only reason this place is getting four stars is because I'm hoping they will put in more machines since this place is always packed! 
There's a reason for that thought - the bartenders, staff and food are AMAZING!! 
Every time I go here I'm always taken care of with a smile and the food is some of the best I've had!! This place keeps me coming back for more every time  (when I can get in that is)"}
{"text":"This has become one of our favorite places to go.  At first, it was because they had big couches and a fireplace.  Secondly, a tiny bunny was hanging out right in front.  I'll have to remember this tactic for future marketing efforts. ;)  Then finally, we tried the food.  I was amazed.  I thought it was going to be like that greasy bar food, but that was furthest from the truth.  My boyfriend is now addicted to their pizza.  Even Jon Taffer on Bar Rescue would love this menu.  Although, I think it's time for a few new fluffy couches!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years, albeit lunch time only so my review ONLY pertains to lunch time.
Food is \"Off the Hook\" as Guy Fieri would say.  The Burgers are one of the best I have had in Las Vegas and they will cook it medium/rare, the Chili is great too very meaty and not burn your mouth off hot.  I really have not had a meal there and I think they have the best Stella in the Valley, Chris the manager is well versed in beers and keeps clean lines, Kate the day shift bar tender is a hoot and you only need to tell her your name once and she will remember it.
I have not been there at night so I cannot comment on that."}
{"text":"For a Tavern style place the environment and food is great.  The \"Steak & Fries\" is a most unique and delicious dish, as is their Certified Kobe hot dogs.  Unlike most taverns, Fireside prices are more in line with a standard restaurant - which is okay, because so is their food.  I love the environment inside - nicely decorated, dark and cool - perfect on a hot Vegas day or night.  Although I don't drink, per se, they appeared to have an extensive speciality beer selection.  Overall, I am actually looking forward to coming back and trying a few more of their interesting menu items."}
{"text":"Had a really pleasant experience at Fireside!
My best friend and I had just come back from a long weekend...and an even longer day of traveling + work.  We were exhausted and in need of a good beer and solid meal.  Fireside Tavern popped up on our Yelp - it had good, consistent reviews and was close to home, a win-win!
As we walked in, we were immediately greeted by Justin, the bartender.  Justin was awesome! He is part of the reason I would definitely go back! Not only was he very attentive and always there when we needed anything, but he was very patient with us (couldn't decide what to eat - we were just that out of it). 
I liked the atmosphere of the place as well - the perfect evening/late-night joint to just chill at the bar, have a few beers and some good conversation, or enjoy some above par bar fare.  
I told Justin the type of beer I like the most (Hefeweizen), and he brought me back something delicious! I don't remember the name, but it hit the spot perfectly!  I then ordered the steak and fries - the steak was very good! The fries had cheese and gravy and I almost finished the entire dish (aka, they were also very good).  My friend ordered the Cajun pasta and WOW! That was DELICIOUS! I plan on ordering that at some point in the future, and I'd also like to try one of their burgers.  Fireside - we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Overall very good experience. I was looking for a sit down dinner with reasonable prices and Fireside delivered. The dining area had a slight odor of cigarette smoke- not overpowering but noticeable and may not be for everyone.
I was eating alone because I am traveling for work. I was seated quickly. The waiter was great, attentive but not pushy.
I had the house salad which was a good portion. Lots of greens and romaine. A few onions cucumbers and croutons with balsamic. Enough it could be shared by two.
I ordered the steak and fries which was very good and bad. Hot fries, cheese and gravey with sliced steak cooked to order. Good but more of the bad stuff than I usually eat. I polished off the salad myself so I didn't mind leaving fries on the table. The steak was cooked perfectly - medium. Nice and tender. It was $15.99 for the plate. I would have preferred more meat and less of the \"bad stuff\".
Kudos to waiter Michael! Thanks!"}
{"text":"I'm thinking about making this place a new bad habit of mine. I've been here twice but I think I'll be coming here to stay. First off, the bartender Justin is a total sweetheart and quite efficient. I never felt neglected like I have experienced in a certain chain bar. Secondly I got the breakfast sandwich, an unusual choice for me to be sure, but it was absolutely amazing. After 11 they switch to a limited menu, but the kitchen does stay open 24/7. The sandwich was completely customizable to your own tastes while I was expecting a generic warm-it-up-here-it-is sort of sandwich. I imagine the bread was toasted in approximately a half ton of butter -- perfect. The guests that come in are always in for a good time and unwinding, no drama at this bar! And of course let's not forget their awesome beer selection. The scrolling TV screen seems neverending with a versatile variety of options. I'll stop myself before I ramble too long, but if you're thinking about coming here, do. It's worth a visit."}
{"text":"I just moved to this side of town so I had to find me a new fave bar to hang out that's close to my new place AND that's open 24/7-- and found Fire Side. It was a great first choice! It was around 1am when we got there and we were starving. We ordered the fried pickle chips (yummy), breakfast burrito and chicken tenders with buffalo sauce (big portion). My 2 faves are the fried pickle chips and the drink I kept ordering-- Rekorderlig Cider (strawberry lime)! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Jesse Rae's barbecue now since January first I believe, went tonight for the first time though we can't see why as we live right here in Veritas. The food was OUTSTANDING. The night cook (Tony) took care of us and let us sit in a booth eating area even tho it was later on a weeknight and a little empty. We got the pick two meat: brisket and ribs with bbq mash potatoes. To die for. The God sauce was perfect. They have an Alabama sauce that's similar to the best ranch you've ever tried and really brought out the flavor in both flavor wings we got. And the wings were HUGE and cooked perfectly. Rob meat fell off the bone. Couldn't ask for more. Really a treat and will be back very often. Like to say thank you."}
{"text":"Service & food are just delightful! I found my new spot to hang out. The bar staff is amazing - I never wait for a drink and they are all fun to hang out with."}
{"text":"I would have liked to have gone here but it is 21 and over so couldn't bring my daughter I'm actually surprised because normally an establishment that sells food does not have an age limit"}
{"text":"Great bar!!! Awesome beer selection and a spot on bar staff, Justin may be one of the best bartenders in this city!! One of the only places in the south valley that you can get great food late night. The chicken sandwich is awesome as a wrap, and you can't leave without having the cheesy tots. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Game two of NBA Final's....Ahh who cares anyways we came to Fireside for some great beers with pizza in mind and good times.  We found everything we were looking for at Fireside Tavern.  We left my buddies local watering hole because of mediocre beer choices and average food offering's of burgers and sandwiches and just short car ride away to end up here.

A little dark when you first walk in because of the scorching Nevada sun, I nearly walked into the wall upon entering.  After taking a moment to adjust the eyes to the cave like feel with rich mahogany wood blanketing the bar and seating areas. We were greeted by an attractive friendly bar tender who then chased us away from the bar because we were not gaming. Fine with me I would rather sitting in one of the large wrap around booths surrounding the bar with a better view of the game and no smoke from the continuous chain of tabacco being ignited. 

After checking out the menu my friend and I decided to go with what we came for which was a large cheese and pepperoni pizza.  The rest of the menu look great as well serving some hearty dishes with choices of steak and seafood.  The pizza came out quickly and was bubbling hot.  Our server had prepared us prior to its arrival with plates and jars of crushed red pepper and parm to top this magnificent pizza with.  Everything about this pie was what I was looking for in this meal.  I give the pizza a high rating of 4.5 out of 5 for sure.  I think I also found my friend a new watering hole near his home.  

Another great thing about Fireside is the above average beer choices.  I love great flavorful beer, not foaming rice water like AB, Mill, or Coors.  I also prefer to buy local if that choice is available.  Fireside carries Joseph James which is brewed in Henderson, NV.  If I need to help tap a few kegs to support my neighbor, I am all for it.  Keep the money flowing in our communities if possible.  Why support August Busch IV I think they are doing just fine.  At Fireside they have over 20 beers on tap many that of great quality and different brew syles like IPA, Chocolate Stout, Red, Lager, Wheat, and Pils. 

If you are in Henderson I recommend stopping by Fireside Tavern for some great pizza, beer and service.  I know I will be back even though it is 30 miles from home."}
{"text":"I had my very first hostessing job at Fireside when they opened 10+ years ago...so I'm a bit biased. Oh, the nostalgia. I haven't been back in YEARS. My parents were about to hit the road to move to Denver for good, and we needed a place down the street from their house to grab a bite and a pint after we said a tearful goodbye to my childhood home. Nothing fussy, no wait, something comfortable with good food. A place where everyone knows your name! 

We were literally the only ones in the dimly lit dining room, so we settled into a booth away from the smoky bar, and quizzed the unsuspecting waitress on their beer selection. Their menu was outdated with beer options, the chalkboard outside advertising Delirium was incorrect, and their TV list was wrong too. Poor gal had to recite everything until we finally settled on a New Belgium Snapshot, a 24 oz. hef my mom \"accidentally\" ordered, and a Stella for my dad. Their menu is pretty consistent, although the famed wedge salad I ordered on Valentine's Day 2005 has evolved a bit. We started with some piping hot spinach artichoke dip which really hit the spot. My parents thought it was too salty but I've never had such a thought in my life. 

I had the American Burger - cheese, fried pickles, thousand island dressing, lettuce, tomato- with a side of curly fries. Huge portion, I wanna say $13.99. 

Not a date atmosphere, a little smoky, dark, but great bar food!"}
{"text":"Went for my first time this weekend and the bartender was incredibily nice. Machines were hot. I didnt eat the food but the atmosphere was awesome. I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this bar a shot to watch the Australian Open. Bartender was Patrick, and he did not disappoint. He was very friendly and personable with each of the guests... Even shut off the radio to blast the tennis match to provide that extra touch of great customer care. The beer list is surprisingly unique in that they receive some rare stuff from Joseph James, Deschutes and Lagunitas. Their roasted artichoke was a great appetizer and one that frequently \"sells out\" from what I hear. 

I very much look forward to becoming a regular at this bar."}
{"text":"Service is wretched the last three times I've come. Can honestly say the location is just convenient for a quick fix. Wouldn't recommend to a stray dog if there was another option. Staff is more focused on drinking with friends than making sufficient money."}
{"text":"I miss Fireside a lot. This was my neighborhood bar when I lived over there and the only place in Vegas where I actually got to know the bartenders. When you walk in it looks like any other PT's type pub in town. What sets it apart is the food and beer selection. Check the screen near the back of the bar for a list of interesting beers. They had Delirium Tremens on draft for awhile. Their food is outstanding. My favorites include the cheesy tots, fried pickles, spinach and artichoke dip, and their pepper strami sandwich. Bar food doesn't get much better than this. Unfortunately for Fireside, they have Remedy's and Born and Raised nearby to compete with and they have some pretty good food as well. But if you want to just tuck away and play some video poker without all the crowds this is the place to be. I would love if they had other locations around town."}
{"text":"The food was delicious. Far superior to an average pub menu, I had the fried pickle chips with an herbed aioli (I can't remember exactly what, but I think it was dill) and the Double Dog Dare Your Burger option...get ready for this...1lb. ground beef cooked exactly as ordered, 4 slices of crispy bacon, 4 slices of cheese (I chose Swiss), thick slices of tomato, fresh lettuce, chunky slices of crisp red onion, a fried egg cooked exactly as ordered, and all of it resting between two perfectly browned grilled cheese sandwiches with American cheese. Bring your appetite! The tap selection was solid and our server was attentive and friendly but not intrusive. The atmosphere was great - low lighting without being too dark, background music without being too loud to converse or too quiet to feel strange about chatting at your table, and decor that accented the classically styled dark wood surroundings. If you're ready to go off-strip, I highly recommend this local Vegas establishment."}
{"text":"Drove by this place for years but today I stopped in. I had the fire burger - one of the best burgers I've had in a long time.  Staff is friendly too."}
{"text":"My local watering hole... the bartenders are awesome.  Try the cheese plate!  An interesting selection considering the specialty is bar food."}
{"text":"The food and service here has always been excellent. I have stopped here many times and have never been disappointed. Breakfast, lunch & dinner.  Wine selection is great. Just one small complaint and since I'm a senior I had to get the flashlight on my phone out to read the menu. Just a tad dark in here."}
{"text":"Lots of beers Great fireplace Recently visited for a Ravens game Seemed run down furniture and rugs needed replacement; lacked the warm log cabin feel Service was friendly"}
{"text":"This review is for 3.5 stars.

I cam for the beer selection as I had heard good things about the draft list at Fireside Restaurant & Tavern.  Their list is actually quite good, very similar to the Total Wine on tap list.  They also had some rare bottles that were expensive and some solid local brands as well.  ost beers range in the $5-$7 range.

The service was good when it came around, but the waitress took 20 minutes to recognize us at the bar to order and then another 15 minutes to get the check at the end.  The beer menu is also not updated day by day so it does not show the most current selection which can be deceiving.  The one thing I absolutely love, however about Fireside is that they show prices of their draft and bottle selection which is actually surprisingly rare in Las Vegas.

Overall I want to come back and give Fireside an updated better revieew.  The service just did not earn a 4 star review.  The beers were solid for the area and the bar itself wasn't as divey inside as I thought it would be upon parking.  I will be back for a good beer in Henderson."}
{"text":"This place is awesome,  the bartender had hooters the size of watermelons said Moses to the Egyptians . There beer selection sent my tiny little nipples to France"}
{"text":"Get the pickles, 9.99 for a 3 person pickle basket. Are you kidding me?? It was amazing!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Always do pick up orders and they rock. Always good food and never any problems!!"}
{"text":"Amazing turkey burger. Yes, it's dark, but, bartender Kate made me (just a gal from FL wandering around)  feel soooo comfortable! Even though the only people inside when I arrived were her and an intoxicated stranger, she made me feel safe and it stayed that way the couple of hours I was there!"}
{"text":"I go here all the time. Love the picked chips.! Bartenders are always super nice. Laid back video poker spot and close to the house. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly service, and a great craft beer selection.

But FUCK, only when I travel to Nevada do I get reminded how cigarette smoke in a bar/restaurant is just fucking ridiculously annoying and disgusting.  

Walking in to this place, it's like walking into a cave...a really dark cave filled with the stench of thousands of smoked/currently being smoked cigarettes.  They probably keep the lighting dim to hide the catchers mitt  faces of the smokers who congregate around the bar.  Too bad that this is my biggest memory of this place, because they serve a mean burger with great tasting meat, toppings, and soft homemade bun.  They also have a really great beer selection, with many crafts to choose from on both tap and in a bottle.  And the service is great, with friendly bartenders who aren't bad on the eyes (at least from what I could see in the darkness).

Overall, if you have to be in Henderson NV like I was for work, then this isn't a bad spot that you can walk to from the Hampton Inn across the street and a block down or so.  And in all fairness, all of the little bar/restaurants like this in the area are full of the smokers looking for an acceptable place to go so they can smokes while they eats, which is what they likes to do.

Would be four stars plus if not for the stench."}
{"text":"My local watering hole. 
Beer: Amazing selection of craft brews. They pride themselves on having quality and unique beers consistently. They carry beers from breweries such as Firestone Walker, Stone, Deschutes, Chimay, Deliriium, North Coast, Lagunitas, New Belgium, Goose Island, Ballast Point, and Maui Brewing Co. to name a few. 

Food: Great food. There are a few favorites of mine. Nachos, Seafood Bisque, Steak & Fries, Breakfast Burrito, Breakfast Sandwich, and Biscuits and Gravy. 

Staff: Awesome. They are helpful and personable. 

There are also a significant amount of LCD TVs that make this an ideal place to watch sports. There is also a couch which is in front of a real fireplace and a HUGE projection screen which is used for big sporting events."}
{"text":"Great place great service great drinks the bar tenders are awesome specially Sunday nights they have a little  bartender I believe her name is Jessi super sweet not to mention sexy... and her sidekick mikey made this place worth coming back to define really check it out"}
{"text":"WORST FOOD EVER. Don't waste your time. It all tastes like it was soaked in salt and kept in the fridge until you ordered it. So gross."}
{"text":"A good, quiet, and comfortable place to sit and have a nice meal.  I usually try something new each time and I've never been disappointed.  Plus the beer selection is great!  Staff is on top of it, and the place is nice and clean.  Love the booths too.  They also keep it kinda dark in there and I like that.  Plus great prices!"}
{"text":"Bartenders in there are good. Food is decent too. My complaint is the beer selection. It used to be great with many odd, rare, tasty craft brews. At times, they would have unique brews that no one else had. Joseph James seasonals and barrel aged usually were on draw there. Firestone reserve proprietors and goose bcbs would pop up every so often. 

Now they have nothing new and have generic crap you would find in bigger casinos like gvr and south point. I go in there very rarely now but even then it is basically the same selection as a couple months before. What happened?"}
{"text":"Average. Very average.

We walked through the doors and everything was pitch black. Like vampire cave dark. Like you need to use your iPhone flashlight because you're afraid for your life dark.  Then our eyes finally adjusted and a woman behind the bar told us we could seat ourselves.

We walked over to I almost want to say a separated eating area away from the bar. We were greeted quickly by Carolina. She took our drink orders and left us to decide what culinary delight we would be partaking in.

Atmosphere: 3/5 (after our eyes finally adjusted, the place didn't look half bad!)

Service: 3/5- Carolina was very sweet and friendly but because we were the only two people eating at the time she didn't have to walk around and check on her guests so there were multiple times that our drinks sat empty for upwards of ten minutes.

Fried Pickles: 4/5- I definitely would recommend maybe sitting at the bar enjoying some drinks with these juicy gifts from heaven. Very tasty and not too over cooked. We had them with ranch but I feel like if they had like a ranch hybrid with a little kick it would really knock these out of the park!

Cheesy Tater Tots: 5/5- My fiancé got these with his burger instead of fries and being the terrible person with no self control at all. I ate them. I ate every last one of them. And I would gladly do it again and again. These were my favorite part of our whole meal, actually our whole experience.

Fire Burger & BYO Burger: 2/5- Very, very bland unsubstantial burgers for what we were paying. If I'm paying upwards of $15.00 for a burger it better at least be seasoned. Edible but not satisfying is how I would have to describe them. It's really a shame the flavor wasn't there too because the burger itself was cooked beautifully. Very juicy. Just very tasteless.

I have a strong feeling of we came here and just got drinks and appetizers this would've been a five star review."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a late night snack and tried the spinach artichoke dip and chicken fingers. Both were delicious! We found a cozy spot next to the fireplace and it was a nice romantic way to end our evening. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"For all the local competition around this area, Fireside has the friendliest bartenders and beat food you could hope for. Don't miss out on the filet fries. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Was there on Sunday afternoon with my wife. Maybe 5 customers in the place, but the service from the bartender was absolutely nonexistent. Will never go back!"}
{"text":"My wife & I went here for dinner about a week ago.  The first time I've ever seen a Kobe Beef Hot Dog advertised, so that's what she ordered.  She enjoyed it, though not sure it was worth $12.  My meal was average.  This place is ok, nothing to rave about, but they do have some unique menu items that may be worth checking out."}
{"text":"Very dark on the inside spinach dip was to damn parmesan...my sandwich u did had to much cheese it was nasty .. Curly fries were good"}
{"text":"We tried the fried pickle chips......yum! The cheese munchies.....yum! A really chill, relaxed atmosphere. I asked the bar tender about their whore ales and gave me additional samples outside of what I ordered. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Wonderful beer tap and bottle selection! I always discover something new. I enjoy the gaming. The bartenders are all attentive. Lots of liquors, too. Potato skins are scrumptious. Lots of parking. A comfortable neighborhood bar. With all the construction surrounding it, its going to become more of a secret beer lovers den."}
{"text":"In this town, bars are a dime a dozen. They are on every street corner, shopping center, and neighborhood.  We love coming to Fireside Restaurant and Tavern because not only is it right down the street, this is far from just an ordinary neighborhood bar.  

We enjoy coming here for the convenience and the personalized service.  Justin is always amazing, friendly, attentive, and professional not with just us, but with everyone in his bar.  He shakes our hands, greets us with a great attitude, and presents us with our usual beer right when we sit.  Their broad and adventurous beer list is an obvious draw but it's really the service and the wonderful attention we get from everyone from the bartender to the cooks in the back.  Everyone is very accommodating and we've never had a bad time visiting.  It's not only gaming and smoker friendly, but also non gaming a great place if you just want to hang out after a long day or people watch.  Breakfast and a limited menu is offered after midnight and on occasions they have live music playing on the weekends. 

If you are looking for a place to just relax and grab some grub after a long day, look for Justin, the service he provides comes second to no other bar in this town.  And with all the choices you have in this town, that does wonders for me.  Now if we can get pool tables in there?!?!? :)"}
{"text":"Discovered this place via local checkins on Untappd. Great atmosphere, friendly bartenders and a great beer list. I've only visited once, but based on their tap selection and the staff I will return."}
{"text":"Fireside used to be one of my favorite hang outs.  The seafood bisque,  Fireburger,  craft beers,  and staff were top notch.  In the last year or 2 the quality continues to plummet.  The draft beer menu is out of date by months, bartenders are rude,  and the menu has been limited and prices increased.  Its a real shame."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened on this visit....

I used to love the chicken tenders, they used to be large plump pieces of chicken that were juicy and really good.

This time I got three relatively good size pieces but they looked like they were pounded flat and were over cooked.  They were hard from being over cooked and why pounded flat and not juicy at all, made this visit not worth the price.

I am very disappointed and probably won't order these again as they seem to have changed.  The sweet potato fries I got with the chicken were actually under cooked.  Not sure what happened in the kitchen but am very disapp"}
{"text":"This was the first place we visited in henderson and it is great. The bartender  patrick was super nice and the steak sandwich with fries was totally satisfying."}
{"text":"Really dark in there but a nice place. Friendly staff and a typical local gaming bar but..... their artichoke roasted with dipping sauce is the bomb. It is way better than bar food. I have tried nothing else so I can not say what else is good. Yay for artichoke."}
{"text":"Love love love the bartenders Justin and Brett! I come here because it's near my best friend's house and this is usually our last stop of the night or the place I go to to unwind after work. Bartenders are very attentive and welcoming. Fireside has a laid back atmosphere and has definitely become one of my fave local bars."}
{"text":"For any of the reviewers who gave this place fewer than 5 stars for the food, you owe yourself and this restaurant another visit. The food is great (Bleu Cheese Bison Burger) and a masterful selection of craft brews make Fireside my new go-to when I'm in town. Can't wait to come back and try the cheesy tater tots! 
I sat at the bar & enjoyed my dinner and got great service from the bartenders."}
{"text":"I tried to order any cocktail and they didn't have any mixers. The food is good some days and bad the next. I was disappointed because its near where I live, but I don't care to go back."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Great egg sandwich, sausage patties are huge! Service is quiet on the restaurant side. Staff are nice and efficient. It's not busy on the restaurant side and perfect for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"They have a meeting room, but they really don't want groups there. At least, they sure go out of their way to make you feel unwelcome.

There is plenty of lighting in the room, but they will fight you over turning it on. For no reasons that I can fathom, the switches are under the bar rather than in the room itself. From the way the bartender acted, the switches might as well have been in Siberia. I was just bitchy enough to get him to turn them on the first time, but if I wasn't there, he would flat-out refuse to to turn them on for the rest of the group. He said the first time that he didn't know where they were until I told him I would look for them myself - and then he magically found them. He tried that with the group when I wasn't there, but someone was in text contact with me and I told her that was Blarney. Next, he tried to tell her that they were too hard to turn on and didn't work. It's a light switch, people, not an algebra problem. And they worked the previous week.

If you have a group, no matter how small, they cannot be bothered to allow separate orders. Of course you don't get told this until they bring out one check and you're all sitting there looking stupidly at each other trying to figure out what to do with it.

The server was rude and condescending. His tips were given begrudgingly, and we are typically a big tipping group. 

Needless to say, we found another venue right away. Given how otherwise dead they were for the entire 3 months we met there, they proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that they would rather act childishly then actually have paying customers. Good luck with that business model.

For the most part, the food was decent. Drinks were way overpriced."}
{"text":"The service was fast and friendly, and the food was solid. My only problem was my own lack of preparation/knowledge: I didn't realize smoking was allowed inside, so that detracted from my experience. Overall, though, I have no complaints. If you don't mind smoke, this is a great restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is pretty cool.  On the outside it feels just like a Timbers or some other type of chain-y place, and admittedly the inside is a bit like that too.  But what sets this place apart is the beer selection.  They have a great selection of Belgium beers on tap as well as in the bottle.  They have samplings of beers as well.  The menu is not too spendy and they have a 1 pound burger between two grilled cheese sandwiches.  I have to try it!  The waitresses and bar tenders have been nice both times I have been."}
{"text":"Loved the curly fries. Nailed the medium rare on my delicious burger! Too bad don't have underage section."}
{"text":"Today we came to this bar to watch the Packers vs. Colts game.  I've heard about this place through coworkers and that fact that one of those coworkers has a husband who bartends there.  

The place is cozy.  The dark lighting and wood finishes makes me feel like I'm in a log cabin in the rockies.  I like the fact that there are two places in the joint:  The restaurant and the bar area.  On top of that, there is so much space and so many tables for seating.  Small rooms here and there, offer some very intimate dining for people.  The bathrooms were clean and warm compare to the air conditioned joint, which was good LOL.

I didn't end up getting anything to eat, but I did decide to get a couple of spicy Bloody Maries.  They were soooo good.  The bill came our to $11.50 for both drinks.  The drinks were topped with green olives and lemon and lime.  The drink wasn't super spicy and was really made good.  I definitely recommend this drink, especially if you're looking for a good pick me up at 10am LOL.

All in all, I turned over to my friend and said this will be our go to place.  We're all about checking out other bars every game but if all else fails, we're definitely coming back to this bar.  It works for what we're looking for!"}
{"text":"Love this bar! Great beer selection, great food! It's nice and dark, but cozy not creepy. The bar staff is one of the best in town : Rob, Kele,Kate,Shaun,Brett & Jess. Thanks for being so close to my house. and the Irish mist"}
{"text":"Love the food and staff, only thing is the food can be a bit pricey at times for a pub."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite bars for sure. The food is outrageous, and they have an excellent craft beer selection.  Every bartender there has been as helpful as could be.  I highly highly recommend the chili."}
{"text":"Never disappointed when I come here! Amazing food 24/7! Great beer selection and the bar staff is top notch!"}
{"text":"I absolutely was not impressed and I will never go back.  If I could give it a 0 star rating I would. 1st off lets start by saying the 1st step you take inside the door you can smell that people are smoking.  I guess the law of no smoking inside a restaurant is not enforced.  It's also, so dark inside I could not read the menu without my cell phone flash light on.  I placed my order and when it is brought out to me, its wrong.  So now I have to send it back while my friends are able to eat.  Of course I am aggravated about it.  Whats so hard when you order a filet tip sandwich and ask for only the meat, cheese and bun.  Obviously the waitress didn't understand what that meant or the cook didn't.  So now that my friends are half done with their food and my re-do order is now brought out, I'm in shock that this filet tip sandwich had very little meat in it.  Literally more bread then anything.  I guess the cook wasn't happy that I sent the order back the 1st time.  At this point I'm even more aggravated.  I only wish I was with different friends cause I would of sent it back again.  There was absolutely no way this sandwich was worth the 15 bucks that they charge for it.  Did I eat it yes and did I pile all the excess bread on my plate,yup.  It was also the worst tasting filet sandwich I have ever had.  It definitely did not fill me up and now after I post this I will be cooking myself something to eat."}
{"text":"I love fireside! I've come in very late and the food is always amazing, definitely not your typical greasy bar food, the bartenders and staff are very nice and I always get great service. The decor is dark and intimate, the couch and the fireplace is a great place to drink and relax"}
{"text":"It's a little far south, but plenty worth to attract you to travel that far. 

This bar really values craft beer as far as tap selection goes. They also highly value their local beers, so it's a great place to try one or two local offerings. Sometimes beer events like tap takeovers or pairings also occur here.

Bar food ranges from mediocre to great. The burgers are definitely a high point especially when being guzzled down with one of the many beers."}
{"text":"Blah. Overpriced meh bar food and unfriendly bartenders. Sucky drink policy for players too. Really wanted to like it but not a fan."}
{"text":"My second time, and I ordered the same thing that I had the first time. It was not even close. I don't know if they changed the recipe or the cook, but it wasn't that great, too much herbs and seasoning overpowered the dish. Honey mustard dressing on my salad was too tangy, it actually burned my throat when i ate it. I used my friends Caesar dressing, much better. Salad was nothing special otherwise. My water was empty, the waitress never refilled it. We shared a chocolate lava cake, it was okay, something you could make at home with a box mix.
I'll try them again if given the opportunity, but I'll try something else."}
{"text":"Pickle chips!  Just get the pickle chips.  Great food and good bartenders."}
{"text":"I finally made it to Fireside a couple of weeks ago.  it was as described...looks like a Timbers but has some nice brews on tap you might find Joseph James, Tenaya Creek, Firestone, Ballast Point and or Hangar 24.  It was odd that my friend lost his credit card in the leather recliner and we had to turn it upside down before finding it.  I was lucky that I didn't know anyone in the joint actually this place would be a good hideout as well."}
{"text":"love this place! the best food & Chris is an attentive and fun bartender. the chicken avocado sandwich is great, and the eggs Benedict are perfect. highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food and a solid selection of brews. They even had Chimay which can be a hard beer to find. Fireside has surpassed Distill as my favorite locals bar in the area."}
{"text":"I usually come by here late night.  A cool spot to chill at.  Great cocktails.  Chill ambiance.  There's a huge fireplace, hence-the name \"Fireside\".  So cozy, and the couches are super comfy.  Late night bartender Patrick is amazing!  

but the best?  THE FOOD.  Chicken wraps, fries, salads, everything!  My absolute favorite is the SLIDERS!  OMG!  Filet sliders are DELICIOUS!  Please try them.  Sliders will never be the same..."}
{"text":"Well.. Fireside has run it's course. Although it will forever hold a special place in my heart the time has come to seek food and drinks elsewhere. The food has gone downhill majorly, something is always broken in the kitchen making the menu limited, but the final kicker is the horrible music. ALWAYS. During every major sporting event. NBA playoffs, Olympics, NFL games. If you ask to have game audio turned on in lieu of music the bartenders and servers have absolutely no problem telling you- and this is an actual quote from multiple employees- \"no, we don't want our gamers looking up.\" -insert shocked and disgusted face here-

Last night the kitchen was shut down because of some issue and the bar was PACKED more than I have ever seen it in years. The majority of the patrons (all loyalty wearing their Las Vegas Golden Knights gear) were not there to gamble. They were all watching the hockey game, but we never got any game audio because Culture Club, George Michael, and Duran Duran were BLASTING over the speakers. My husband and I used my phone for game audio while we literally sat in our booth near the door and counted multiple groups walk in the door, point at the TVs, scoff at the music, AND LEAVE. 

I cannot imagine that a couple old bitties playing Keno gamble soooo much that they are bringing more income to the bar then all the proud and rowdy hockey fans that drink like fish and buy rounds of shots for all their buddies constantly.

My review actually decreased in stars by the end of my typing. Sad."}
{"text":"I used to live right by this place, and we'd walk here sometimes.  Now that we live further away, the location is still quite convenient, and it's nice that it's all by itself (although not for long since they're putting a gas station in next door).  The dinner/lunch fare can be a tad overpriced, but it usually pretty good.  The breakfast food is more reasonably priced and you can find some good deals for good breakfast food.

Overall, I would call this place a small step up from PT's in atmosphere and food."}
{"text":"Great craft beer selection! Very friendly bar staff. I'm actually annoyed this place was so close to where I live and yet I never thought to grab a beer there. I just figured it was just another Lodge/PTs/strip mall type bar...man was I wrong. Food wise - I only tried the Fire Burger which was very good but actually lived up to its name and put me on my ass a little bit. Cannot recommend this place enough - go there"}
{"text":"Stopped in at Fireside to visit my favorite Bartender Rob, who just started new job tonite. Real happy he is here, it's one of Angie and I's favorite places to unwind. We have been coming here since it opened. Great food & Atmosphere. Always feel welcomed."}
{"text":"OMG! Delicious food, ridiculously large sized portions, awesome server and bartender! And jamming music from the late 80s and early 90s. 
They have a nice size bar area and cozy seating. 
My only complaint is the smoking, but i guess it's to be expected at a bar"}
