{"text":"As the other reviews say, this place is a neat environment and comfortable place to have a tea/relax while visiting Kensington. This is one of the only places I know that serves Chaga mushroom tea (wild mushrooms from birch trees). The reason for the 2-stars is I came here specifically for the Chaga tea, and was very disappointed with what was served. Normally Chaga brew has a dark brown liquory appearance (think dark espresso) but what was served looked more like diluted iced tea - it was very watered down and tasted more like hot water than Chaga mushrooms.
I really want to like this place but I don't think I'll be back, at least not for the Chaga."}
{"text":"As I rub my vegan coconut oil from Samadhi Tea House into my hands, I reflect on a great afternoon in a friendly, serene setting. What a great re-charge.

The owners (I believe originally from the Middle East) are extremely friendly and have a vast amount of knowledge on the teas they stock, which run the gamut from greens to oolongs to herbals and even chagas (a mushroom which apparently has wonderful health-related properties, including cancer-fighting ones). In addition, on one side, some fantastic and fairly unique organic goods are for sale - sliced red bananas, dried mulberries, and the like (the owners will provide numerous samples) - and on the other, some cute art. In between are no more than 4 tables with comfy seats, chess boards, and little rugs and bamboo mats which add a Buddhist flair.

The owners invite you to take off your shoes and roam around in your socks - it feels like a living room in a way. I had the Holy Basil Tea and a very good live pizza, with beet hummus (!), walnut \"cheese\", micro greens, on a chia/flax/hemp/whatever other superfood crust. $7 including tax and pretty filling, plus $3 including tax for the pot of tea.

Only one criticism - I think they should get some tea mugs for those who stay in-house to match their nice looseleaf teapots (versus the paper cups provided).

Keep up the great work! This place feels like a success already."}
{"text":"My husband was impressed by the chaga tea and it's a nice quit shop in the busy Kensington market."}
{"text":"Great little store - such a great vibe - almost transformative when you walk in from the city's hustle and bustle. 

This is a great place to really get in the zone if you need to focus on something, or simply disconnect for a bit."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in the city. Cozy space, delicious tea, great selection of herbs and teas to buy and to order. Friendly staff, good vibe."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place in a BlogTO article and was intrigued - a quiet place to have tea in Kensington Market??!!  It sounded perfect during such a chaotic holiday season.  Sure enough, I was not disappointed.  The proprietors were very mellow and seemed to know everything about the teas that they were selling - I ordered the Crystal Tea, which was a nice spicy gingery blend.  They also gave us some dates with walnuts, which were a nice treat.  

Overall, just a nice serene place to have a quiet tete a tete without the sound of high pressure frothers and piped in music.  Also a bevy of dried fruits, organic chocolate, etc.  

Side note: the bathroom is in the back, to the right side.  The other room looked like a yoga/prayer room?"}
{"text":"Great variety of tea (and herbs) and a nice, quiet space to rest and relax. It's a nice little escape to settle from the outside world.

i had a lovely pot of oolong tea to rejuvenate from a long day of walking about the city. I picked up a bag of Jollitea (tea + flower + herb blend) and and bag of Pau D'arco (tree bark tea) to take home. 

There is a cute doggie who sleeps in the shop. Just keep a lookout underfoot, because I almost stepped on it while deciding on a place to sit.

I would highly recommend this shop to anyone who loves tea. There is an excellent offering of teas. The shop is a nice place to drink tea alone or with friends. Staff is cordial and helpful."}
