{"text":"Excellent! Stopped while on the road, fast, hot and delicious! I had a crispy chicken sandwich, it was big enough for 2 people and quite different from the usual ones you get elsewhere, they also have quite a bit of Latin/Spanish selections."}
{"text":"This little restaurant is fantastic! I come here every time  I'm town. The best rotisserie chicken in the world. Awesome staff. Try it'"}
{"text":"Food was almost edible but even for the lunch special the cost was too high for what you got.  Wanted to try something new and this time it was a swing and a miss.  Will not go back."}
{"text":"This is some of the worst food I have ever tasted.  I got 1/4 chicken, fries and string beans (which was 9 bucks!).  I lie to you not the string beans tasted straight out of the can with no seasoning or anything added.  The chicken was dry and the sauce which is suppose to be the best part was some of the worst sauce I have ever had.  I honestly don't know how this place is still in business."}
{"text":"I was craving rotisserie chicken and found this place. The quality was ok but the portion size was not worth the money. Maybe a dollar less on plates would be better since the side portions were small."}
{"text":"Wonderful food & Great southern hospitality! Super nice owner & sweet as pie waitress... food is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time today. Was looking for a good Cuban sandwich and what I got was a chewy and soggy sandwich which tasted terribly. Definitely do not recommend this place. You could make better sandwiches at home."}
{"text":"Our first time here and I had the chicken salad and my husband had a sandwich. We both loved our food choices and were very surprised at the quality of food for the price. The young man at the counter was very friendly and we were in and out in less than 30 minutes. Very satisfied and will eat there again."}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended but we must have got them on an off night. My son had grilled ham & cheese, which he wasn't inclined to finish. I ordered a quarter chicken with fried yucca and maduros which was fairly good. My fiance ordered the piqueo which was the most expensive dish on the menu touting a mix of fried pork, chicken, and sausage - which were butterflied hot dogs. Everything was extremely dry and difficult to eat on this plate. The yucca was great but hardened quickly upon getting cold. We were not impressed at all and won't be back. Not sure if we caught them on a off night or what, but this experience was a sad disappointment."}
{"text":"Excellant.  We go here for lunch frequently.  Bread is home made, fresh!! Recommend the chicken sandwhich.  The cilantro sauce was awesome."}
{"text":"If I could give it 0 stars, I would.  This was absolutely the worst meal that I have ever had!  I want the $17 I spent on so-called food back!"}
{"text":"The AC did not work on a 96 degree day... food was bland... smallest shrimp I have ever seen on the fajita... wife said the rotisserie chicken was decent. Overall we were disappointed. We will not be back."}
{"text":"We have lived in the area for 7 years and never tried this place til tonight. We called our order in. I had the barbecue Platterwith baked beans and potato salad, spouse had the beef tips with rice and fries. The barbecue and beans were really good. The potato salad was digusting. Had way to much flavor of dill pickles in it. The beef tips and rice were great. We will be back. But it's not one of the top places in Fort Mill."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Roasting Oven since they open several years ago.  The food is always very good, freshly made and fast.  You can eat in or get it for take out.  They have a fairly broad menu that leans American with different flavors/spices.  Excellent Margarita Salad, chicken and Cuban  sandwich, but everything is good. Not sure why anyone can write a bad review, I've eaten there 20+ times and it's always been good."}
{"text":"Maybe I caught them on a bad day. Well - bland would be a friendly description. I haven't walked away from a meal where I didn't at least think l- I'll give this to my nephew. I'm certain he wouldn't have eaten it either. Got the rotisserie chicken sandwich with potato salad. Now I've had great potato salad made with dill before so it wasn't that it was a different style. It was just plain not good. Didn't taste fresh. The sand which was lacking a ton. I think how can you go wrong with rotisserie chicken?? Yet they did. I went there as a pre cursor to making a catering order for lunch at my job. Glad I tested it first. The catering may be by a different person because true food looks completely different in the pictures. I'm sorry but this was the worst food I have had in a very long time. Did I mention there were only three customers mid lunch?"}
{"text":"Bad news first:  It's a great place if you crave institutional-like food, as in what is served in a hospital, retirement home or school.  It was very bland, and the green beans were quite obviously just poured out of a can and heated - no salt or any type of seasoning. The mac and cheese literally had no flavor, and Stouffers frozen M & C would have been a way better alternative.  As for the rotisserie chicken, it was so dry, that the outer pieces of it were more like \"chicken-jerky\" - if there is such a thing.  It has potential because the flavor isn't bad at all.  The \"green sauce\" that came with my 1/4 rotisserie plate was like everything else: no flavor.  That was more surprising than anything to me since I was expecting it to have some sort of identifiable flavor and spiciness to it.  Since it did not - I can't tell you what it actually was.    
The good news:  It was cute, very nicely decorated and clean!  The tables were covered with cloth tablecloths (as opposed to vinyl ones) and fruit infused water in a nice dispenser.   The young lady at the register was very nice, and when I asked if they actually made their sangria, I was told yes.  I went ahead and ordered one, and it wasn't THAT bad - but I suspect it definitely isn't made in-house."}
{"text":"Four of us ate there last night.  We each had something different and all of the food was awful.  We ate some of the chicken and left everything else.  Even the stewed apples were bad and I didn't think anyone could ruin that dish.  We left hungry and stopped on the way home for something to eat. Two of the four people were ill all night.  Never going back!!!"}
{"text":"Not the greatest, not coming back.
Grilled chicken breast sandwich: WAY more bread than meat. Chicken was pounded so thin was chewy and maybe 4oz. No side weird
1/4 rotisserie chicken dark meat looked more like 1/8 and the green beans were very bland"}
{"text":"Attempt #1 to visit Roasting Oven: Mission Unaccomplished.  We tried tracking the address and map on Yelp and it took us to Plaza Fiesta where we wandered into the middle courtyard where the giant kid play contraption (aka germ magnet) exists and much to our disappointment, it was closed. However we did not go hungry and found a kick ass Mexican place.

Attempt #2 to visit Roasting Oven: Mission Accomplished!! We did more research and found they moved to Gold Hill Road just off I-77. It actually is a much better place for anyone in Fort Mill or Tega Cay to run in and grab dinner to go when they're too lazy to cook.  In fact, even if they aren't too lazy, The Roasting Oven's rotisserie chicken probably is the best in town.  Great flavor and moistness. The sides (especially the frozen corn) were generally unimpressive and beans were average. The sides at Genaro's in Pineville are better. But the The fried plantains are the exception- they are very well done.  We got a family pack and a couple sides that fed 3 of us for $25.

They have a bar, but skip the grape juice infused sangria. 

The casual environment has plenty of indoor seating and outdoor seating as well under a covered pergola.  We would return for the chicken and sounds like they have some other good dishes. The daughter of the family that owns it was incredibly professional and friendly."}
{"text":"The Roasting Oven is a good place to get a different flavor experience. The owner told me it was Cuban/Latin American fusion menu. I love Mexican/Spanish foods, so I figured I'd like it. They have fried plantains, yucca, and other things I have only seen on the FoodNetwork but had yet to try. I'll be honest, I did not try them on my first visit either! I have heard from friends that the rotisserie chicken was awesome and so was their homemade breads. On my first visit I had the Burger 2000 with fries and my friend had the marinated beef tips dinner. Both meals were very, very good. The burger was huge and the homemade bun just melted in my mouth. REALLY! My friend's beef tips were so well flavored and tender. The gilled veggie side was so good too, but she said she would have preferred more onions and the tomatoes instead of mainly green peppers. The rice was very soft, moist and not sticky and clumpy. It could have used a little more flavor though.
  Here's the negatives. The side orders are quite high. I had to order my fries as a side since no burgers come with fries and the small was 1.59 and a large was 2.49. I got the large and it was not alot of fries. I am looking at the take-out menu and here's some prices of other sides; fried yucca-small 2.99 large-3.99; rice and beans-2.99; potato salad-1.49. I wish I could get a burger platter that would include fries. In this economy I am big on getting more bang for my buck so portion sizes are very important
  All in all, it was very good and I am definitely going to go back and try some fried paltains and the chicken. If you're looking for something different for dinner for about twenty bucks I wwould suggest you give them a whirl!"}
{"text":"Literally the best place to go!! The chicken sandwich is amazing. I love the green salsa. I could put that on everything and would even buy it. I got their chicken noodle soup delicious!!! 
Love this place. I crave their chicken. I have never had anything bad from here!!"}
{"text":"While on yelp looking for a Cuban restaurant.. I happened upon this spot and decided to check it out.. what a find.. it's actually Peruvian.. the food was so great I ate lunch and took two dinners with me.. the owner the nice & staff was pleasant.. if you like spicy, ask for the green sauce..better yet the yellow one is awesome.. I had the rotisserie chicken.. yummy..I'll be back.. thank you yelp"}
{"text":"We have gone by this place many times and didn't go in due to ratings and lack of people in parking lot but decided to try it today for lunch.  We both got the 1/4 chicken dark. It was a bit overcooked and dry. The Mac n cheese was pretty good kraft variety but black beans and green beans had no taste. We  ordered what they are world famous for so would think that's the best they have. So many places to eat in the area, I wouldn't waste time on this one. Sorry."}
{"text":"Some of the most bland food I have ever eaten. I probably could've picked up a stouffers frozen meal and enjoyed it more. Way overpriced for the quality (or lack thereof) of the food."}
{"text":"Good food not very expensive. I had the roasted chicken sandwich. It was very good. My son had the bbq and loved it"}
{"text":"I ordered a fried pork sandwich, I think shoe leather would have been just as good. My daughter got shrimp and fries that looked and tasted like it came from the supermarket freezer section. I don't know how they stay in business."}
{"text":"Friendly staff.  Happy.  Other than that...claiming to be the Worlds Best Chicken is a bold claim and when you make bold claims i suggest you back it up.   The expectation was set high...you over promised and under delivered.  Maybe change slogan."}
{"text":"Only gave it one star because I can't rate it 0 stars! Nasty little place!  Nasty food! Ants crawling around inside my soda cup!  Horrible experience!  NEVER going back!"}
{"text":"By far one of the worst meals I've had in a while. The chicken was dry, beans not seasoned at all and Mac and cheese was watery. Don't waste your time with this place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst restaurant ever. The place did not look sanitary and the food was NOT worth its price - it was too expensive for something that tasted worse than what I can cook up myself. Chicken was dry and the green sauce thing had zero flavor. I will NEVER go back and I do not recommend going there in the first place."}
{"text":"This came to me as a recommendation and I was disappointed. The food was subpar and the presentation was even lower.

They did have a lot of lemonade choices. Well, two and some flavored water. I guess that is a plus. 

Nothing to write home about in my humble opinion."}
{"text":"Potatoe salad was old or out for too long. Did not taste good.  Had 1/4 chicken..and tasted good. Not great. Nothing special. I was dissappointed. How the potatoe salad tasted Very bad and room temperature. I may come back to try something else like a sandwich. And give them another try."}
{"text":"Had this bookmarked for a long time. And since my daughters orthodontist is not far from here, we stopped by on our way home. 
It is very simply decorated and clean inside. There was only one worker that I saw and it was early evening on a Monday so maybe they get busy later or on different days.
There were not many choices in the dessert case. (picture)
There is a nice covered patio for eating during warmer weather. 
We purchased the family pack which is supposed to come with salad AND 2 sides. well half way home (30 minute drive) we discovered it was FORGOTTEN. DRAT!!

Anyway once home we opened our containers- she showed me at the place and I was a bit disappointed that the whole chicken was already cut into 1/4s.  i guess I was expecting something like the whole chicken you can get at the grocery store for around $6 that is left whole. And the 2 sides were in 4 different little containers (picture)

NOW- i am picky about my coleslaw so i asked to taste it first before ordering as a side. It was lightly coated with a mayo type stuff that had a tangy sweetness to it (reminded me of miracle whip) although it was good, it didn't knock my socks off. So i ask if the red rice is made in house, she said yes.  WELL..........................
red rice is something close to uncle Ben's type rice with a funky flavor that I must say reminded me of cardboard.
The other side of mac and cheese  took one bite and spit it in the trash- wax like glue cheese coating that did not taste anything near cheese (this is the south- we know mac and cheese).
Now I really wish I had gotten my salad because all I got to eat was the chicken.
I am a white meat eater and the chicken was a little dry- not super dry but you could tell it was made early in the day and had sat for a while. The seasoning is nice, but amazingly oily skin (where all the seasoning is) . It would be great if they could inject it to prevent the drying out as well as getting the flavor into the meat itself. 
I may return to try another item on the menu- but as far as getting the chicken i think I will just stick with my local grocery store since I can call ahead and find out what time they will come off fresh and just pop down the road. 

The variety on the menu is great- but hopefully better than the sides we received. OH I asked if the green beans were seasoned at all and she said no- so that makes me think they are canned- and who doesn't have a can of beans in your pantry collecting dust anyway. If i do return I will be sure to get a side like fries or a baked potato since that would be hard to screw up.
CHEERS!"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken rotisserie sandwich and fries. Food arrived quickly and was hot and delicous.  The chicken was very flavorful and moist and like others have said try the green sauce. Overall a very good experience."}
{"text":"Get the rotisserie chicken sandwich on the house bread, you won't regret it. They've been in business for over 10 years and quality has stayed consistent since then. A real gem in Fort Mill amongst all the chain restaurants."}
{"text":"I've been coming to The Roasting Oven for years and every time the food is outstanding. The owner, Aldo, is kind and hardworking and will always go out of his way to say hello. Obviously, the rotisserie chicken is the star of the show. You get a good portion with 2 sides for a reasonable price. Beef tips are always a favorite of mine. Get either of the above with roasted veggies and smothered in their signature green sauce and you've got an awesome lunch in Fort Mill! 

Atmosphere is no-frills, and is perfect for lunch."}
{"text":"PRICE: $20.00 for two; Classic Burger, Fried Pork Sandwich and two pops. FOOD: The burger was and tasted like a frozen patty. The size of the fried pork sandwich is intimidating, but the taste and expected flavors are absent. THE RESTAURANT: one would expect to order fresh food from a roasting oven, hence the name \"Roasting Oven\". However, the oven was turned off and food is cooked in a regular industrial oven. The tables are covered with black leather clothes and are sticky. The service was basic and the employees or the manager don't come around asking patrons how the food tastes."}
{"text":"Food was subpar, decor was out dated and the ants on the wall made this a terrible dining experience. ."}
