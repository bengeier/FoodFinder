{"text":"Horrible service and the food is just as bad. It really is too bad that tuscola residents have no other choice if they want Chinese food. I personally will wait till im in Champaign for some really good Chinese food. DO NOT waste your money here!"}
{"text":"God golly Miss Molly! For a Chinese restaurant in a little truck stop town in Central Illinois - this restaurant was top notch. 

I was thinking a buffet - oh great - they will probably have about five options - but there were THREE long double sided buffet bars filled with deliciousness. Half the Chinese places I have eaten at in Chicago and the surrounding suburbs have been half as good, and had half the amount of food. 

The food here was: 
1) hot
2) tasty
3) fresh - I was there for about 30 min and they were quick to bring out more when anything got low.

The place was pretty packed as it was lunch rush, but the staff was right at my table the second I seemed to run low on my ice tea.

The best part - $6!!!! Should you ever be in these parts - hit it up!"}
{"text":"NEVER eat at Chinatown restaurant. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. My sister and I tried many different Chinese resturants. We didn't like their food. We discovered Chinatown and they had good food, so we thought. We've eaten there quite a bit. Afterwards we noticed we will feel sick. At first we didn't think anything of it. Come to find out it was their food that was making us sick. STAY AWAY!!!"}
{"text":"Good food. Great price. Selection was surprisingly large, bit it was standard Chinese buffet fare. Wait staff was excellent.  2 adults, a 3 yo and a 5 yo ate for $16 drinking water."}
{"text":"3pm on an NFL Playoffs Sunday is by far the best time to visit. I've got the place to myself, so it's nice and quiet. Food is awesome. Can't beat it.  better than the other options today."}
{"text":"The food is good if they keep it out but the waitress is so freaking rude and watches every move you make and acts like it is killing her to fill your drink! The couple leaving said she wasn't very nice! This was a Sunday at 6pm only one waitress there and not busy!"}
{"text":"Pretty good buffet. Loved the dumplings and crab rangoon. The rice was so-so. Food was replaced quickly which is a bonus at buffet."}
{"text":"I saw some positive reviews and even read what the son of this business owner wrote about it and decided to give it a shot, but this has by far been the worst buffet that I have ever been too. It was 2:30pm which I get it's not the busy time and I didn't expect everything to be piping hot but more than 3/4 of the trays were empty so even had I wanted to ask for it hot I wouldn't even know what to ask for as none of them are labeled either. When I walked in I stood at the front counter for 5 minutes before anyone even acknowledged I was there and then I just sat myself although I was literally the only customer in the place. The food that was out was luke warm AT BEST and I couldn't hardly stomach to even eat any of that. My server was sitting at an empty table the entire time shouting into her phone while the carpeted areas were littered with little bits of paper and trash and the tile portions of the floor were sticky. I will never go here again and I don't recommend anyone wanting to try a new place out attempt to go here either."}
{"text":"We live about 5mi away from the Chinatown Buffet.  We go there about twice a month.  The food has always been excellent for a small town china restaurant.  They always cook and replenish the food as it runs out.  They have a variety of dishes such as crab rangoon, egg rolls, chicken broccoli, dim sum, mushroom beef, and Mongolian beef.  Sundays they have coconut shrimp which is my favorite. 
Its usually packed at the noon hour because its very economical to eat there and lots of people from the area enjoy having lunch in the restaurant.  Of course you can get carry out too.  They charge a flat fee for a styrofoam container and you can pick whatever you want from the buffet and fill your own container. 
Always have excellent service, and are very nice people."}
{"text":"A majority of all buffets generally fall into a 3 star rating for me, but this buffet out in the boonies doesn't have that great of a selection. The service ranged from weird to average. I say weird because I find it odd when the owner walks around nonchalantly eating an entire cucumber and just sitting wherever she pleases. I suppose that's fine with me. 

The food is your standard quality from a buffet and there's definitely better Chinese food out there."}
{"text":"This review is from the son of the restaurant owners, so I would like to explain a few things. I totally understand where the negativity is coming from. There are times where the food isn't the freshest, but that is only during the dead hours of the day. Please understand that a buffet of our size can't afford to make dozens of batches of food for only a few customers because a majority of the food will go to waste. So as the customer, you have all the power to ask for any item on the buffet that is either old or running low. I can speak for the rest of the employees at the restaurant when I say that we are happy to make any item on the buffet that is running low. So my tip for you is to go during the busy hours, but if you find yourself in the dead hours of the day, ask the employees for any item you want. If that seems like too much of an hassle, there is always a menu to order from with a variety of options for a reasonable price."}
