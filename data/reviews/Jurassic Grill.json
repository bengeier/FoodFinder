{"text":"I ordered a double bacon cheeseburger and fries for delivery. Delivery time was about 30 minutes, which I think is fair. The burger was ok. The lettuce was very flat and soggy. I like a more crunchy lettuce on my burgers. The Cajun fries were soggy and there was barely any Cajun spices on it. Not bad but not great either."}
{"text":"We got two burgers with fries for delivery,my only issue was the lettuce. Other than that the food was really good"}
{"text":"The Good: -The burgers are so good! I ordered a cheeseburger with ketchup only (lame, I know).  Turns out it's similar to a double cheeseburger and has cheese between two patties, it's pretty greasy, but absolutely delicious! -The fries were pretty good, but lacked a bit of salt, but hot and fresh!  The Meh: -A serious lack of dinosaur theming! A single toy T-Rex sits in front of the menu...and that's it. I'm assuming they are waiting to see how successful the business is prior to investing in decor, not really a big deal at all, just a little disappointing.  The Bad: -A serious lack of seating! There are literally eight seats in the entire place! I'm guessing that this is again an issue of waiting to see before investing too much in decor, but there's at least room for one more table.  Overall: Definitely worth checking out! I know that I'll be returning again!"}
{"text":"I got  a T-rex cheeseburger with everything on it and a side of cajun fries. The burger was pretty good, but the presentation was terrible. They literally slapped everything together and had the burger leaning one way and the topping leaning another way. the fries were disappointing. When I think of cajun fries I think of delicious thick-cut, crispy fries. Jurassic Grill's cajun fries were  flat, lifeless fries topped the cheapest packet of cajun seasoning they could find. I didn't eat my fries, and I'm not a very picky eater.   Some of their burgers come in the \"T-rex\" version, which will get you an extra patty for a dollar. You get to choose from a good number of basic \"Free Toppings\". It would be nice to have a selection of premium toppings like avocado, portabello mushrooms, bleu cheese, etc. Also, they have a cool theme, so it's beyond me why they don't use it to expand their small menu. They could have a burger topped with guacamole, lettuce, red onion, and pepper jack and call it some like the Guaca-saurus Burger. Their menu places so much info on their free toppings, but ketchup, mustard, onions, etc is not unique enough to keep me coming back to this place for an ok tasting burger.  A lot of untapped potential at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Burgers are delish (greasy but delish). Fries are a little too salty. More than MacDons but less than Firehaus, rating about the same in quality."}
{"text":"Hours say their open til 10, walked there at 8:30 and the owner locked the door and just stared at us through the front window.  We tried to eat there Saturday too and they closed until midnight when their hours claim they're are supposed to be consistently open until 3 am.  I was so excited to try the veggie burger but it's looking like the owner doesn't even want our business."}
{"text":"This place has awesome burgers and fries! I got a double cheeseburger  with cooked onions & mushrooms along with the cajan fries and was not disapointed. The meat was great quality and the food was fresh and hot. Also, the service was very good. The worker went out of his way to make sure we were satisfied, explained the menu and asked if we needed any extras after trying our food.   Like all new resturants there is room for improvement. Being so new they did not have the large extensive menu with all of the awesome named items and additional toppings that everyone has been talking about. The menu at the time of my visit was basic. However, the worker explained that they are in the process of getting the full menu soon.   Aside from the food. This place is deffently small and doesnt have much room to sit down and eat. Which is disapointing but understandable for a new place getting started.   All in all - I will be going back after there full menu is up. If you are going with a large group of people i would recommend getting it to go. Dont let the lack of seating change your mind about trying this place."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to order delivery. Not as quick as I would like but hey, the food was good. Solid burger and fries."}
{"text":"A bit underwhelming. Just burgers and fries on the menu, so not much variety in the food. The burgers are good; but when there's just one thing on the menu I expect it to be fabulous, not just an Applebee's-style hamburger. Limited seating and no ambiance just makes it seem like a doomed business. There's nothing \"Jurassic\" about it, and even something to pull the theme into the actual restaurant (big portion sizes, Sauron-shaped fries, ANYTHING!) would help; but it just seems gimmicky. Went once to see what it was about, but there are infinitely better dining options nearby."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite place to get a burger on campus. Their selection for toppings is very extensive which makes me happy. Additionally there is no extra charge for adding toppings. I also get cheese fries when I get a burger and splurge while I'm enjoying my burger.   I usually take my food to go because there isn't much room to sit in the restaurant which is unfortunate. However, that makes the restaurant less busy which is something that I approve of.   Lastly, they have Fanta to drink which is always a plus. All in all, I will be returning."}
{"text":"Very tasty burger. Hard to pinpoint exactly what the flavor blast behind the burger is coming from. The patty, meat and tomato with an assortment of different toppings really blends nicely. Great quality."}
{"text":"Ordered a T-Rex (2 burger) bacon cheeseburger. It was pretty tasty; nothing to write home about, burgers looked like they were cooked on too-low heat, but tasted good. I ordered cajun fries; not sure if that's what they gave me. It tasted okay, but not particularly cajun-y. They were a little soggy and seemed like frozen fries that had been fried at low temperature or baked. Not a fan of the fries.  Delivery was faster than predicted."}
{"text":"Great bang for your buck, which is perfect for college students. A little over $5 for a huge double patty cheeseburger with free toppings (includes a bunch of stuff from grilled mushrooms and onions, and jalapenos and a lot of other things) of your choice- is an absolute 5 star worthy deal by itself. Plus the burger was made fresh to order and it was very juicy. I am eager to try their brontosaurus burger (which over $8) just to see how big they go on these things. The owner was a friendly guy and it is open till 3 in the morning- perfect for night owls like us. It looks like they have opened recently; I really don't know if it's so but if it isn't so, then they definitely need to work on their seating arrangements and should look more welcoming for people who would like to dine-in, because, it looks like just a take-out place, but with a sh*t ton of empty space with poorly arranged tables/chairs."}
{"text":"For about $1 more you're getting a lot more, higher quality burger meal than you would from Mickey Ds.  The Cajun fries alert soft, fat, and it was hard to stop eating them.   Burgers are made with a large variety of toppings right in front of your eyes.  Feeling hungry?  Eat like a Dinosaur!"}
{"text":"I went to Jurassic Grill because of a Hooked Deal and I was very pleased with the value . Amazing customer service and great food. The cooks are beyond nice to everyone who walk in and I chose to give them more business mainly because I know how much they appreciate each and every customer! Definitely a great business however I wish there was more sitting/moving space."}
{"text":"Hands down best burger ever.  Just a plain burger. Amazing."}
{"text":"Best burgers on campus or near campus. Their special fries are amazing as well. It's a faster and better place than steak and shake. The staff is always friendly and kind. They make you feel welcome and they make amazing food. It's a small place, but still comfy. Plus, it's cool that they are open late. Got to try it at least once."}
{"text":"Got it delivered, got a single burger with ketchup, mustard and mayo... Burger was a pleasant surprise. I expected a very generic cheap tasting burger when I first ordered to be honest. I was surprised to receive a rather tasteful, juicy, and good sized burger. The fries on the other hand, were very soft and floppy, I prefer rather crunchy fries. They may have gotten soggy and soft while being delivered? I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and try the fries in the restaurant next time."}
{"text":"All of the employees here are amazing. They work very hard and efficiently to guarantee top notch service. Food is great."}
{"text":"I read so many articles about this place and was so excited for it to open last semester! I was a little disappointed by the interior (nowhere to sit), but the burgers were pretty good (thick patties and super customizable). Nothing I would go out of my way for, but definitely worth a try -- especially if you use the Hooked deals that come by every day."}
{"text":"Solid burgers. I know their meat is frozen but it sure is tasty. And they use fancy lettuce and have a lot of complimentary topping to pick from. It's kinda like Five Guys but like 90% as good. Overall, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Kudos for being another 3am joint. They fulfill orders fast and stay open late and the food is good. Great theme idea for a college campus. They also have veggie burgers, which is cool.They definitely have to work on building a cohesive image and planning their interior to bring the theme to fruition. Nevertheless, the food is good. I'm bumping up a star because the service is really great."}
{"text":"I really liked their burgers and came back for the fourth time already. The Mexican lady who took my order asked me if I wanted a combo with my burger. I said \"I'm good\" and paid for my burger. I asked for a cup for water  and she gave me the big cup for drinks, but I only got water. They the burger came with fries. I asked her if I ordered combo and she said yes. I didn't say anything back, but this is really unexpected. When I asked if I ordered a combo, I simply imply that I didn't. Either she just assume that I wanted a combo or couldn't understand English. The fries I got were cajun and I don't remember anything close to the word \"cajun\". The fries were soggy and the \"drink\" coming out of the sprite dispenser was just pure soda."}
{"text":"Veggie burger is super bland.  Something wan't right with the food.  Caused some serious gastrointestinal upset (won't give more details, but yikes)."}
{"text":"decent burger and mediocre fries. probably wont be back."}
{"text":"Pretty standard burgers and fries. Nothing special but definitely solid drunk food! There are also a decent amount of options to customize your meal to your liking."}
{"text":"Man, I just wasn't sure what to expect when I walked into this place. There was Hispanic music playing in a burger joint decked out in dinosaur swag. It is a bit different but the food was on point. The burgers are nothing fancy, but cool just right. If you haven't tried them before, order a side of bacon/ranch fries. Holy cow they're good, but I'm certain they may make someone keel over they're so good! I'm only in town for a few more days, but I'll be back before I leave for sure!"}
{"text":"Tasty burgers with the right amount of sauces. Probably the best burgers on Green St. I got a T-Rex bacon cheeseburger for about $6, which is pretty affordable. They also have occasional deals on the Hooked app, so keep an eye out for those."}
{"text":"First time here and had a decent experience! The chefs look like very friendly hard workers! I could see how fast pace they were moving even though it was super crowded! The food was well cooked as well. Just a another good greasy burger joint!"}
{"text":"i ordered delivery. Took a good hour to come. Compy cheese burgers are pretty good. =]"}
{"text":"I had been meaning to try Jurassic after the Empanadas House closed, which was there before.  One hungry afternoon after class I checked the Hooked app and saw Jurassic had $2 off. Perfect opportunity!  Walked into the store and checked out the menu, which is very straightforward and pretty consolidated. I got a T-Rex bacon cheeseburger with a bunch of my favorite toppings, for a little over $5, which, for the size, and amount of calories, was a steal.   The burger was tasty! Nicely put together and blended well with the fresh-tasting ingredients. Didn't get any fries or anything with it. If you're looking for a big, greasy mouthful of 'Merica, this it in all its glory.  Overall it's a solid fast burger place, perhaps expensive without the Hooked deal, but I wouldn't quite say the best burger in C-U, either. In my opinion Farren's probably takes that cake."}
{"text":"Be careful you don't get eaten by T-Rex while in the restroom.   What makes this charburger place unique from all others is that their normal burgers include two meat patties. Get the junior versions if you wish for one meat patty burgers. One aspect that is sucky-ducky is its small dining area. There's around six seats total and nowhere to eat outside."}
{"text":"OMG I would easily eat a burger from here every day. It's simple, yet absolutely delicious. The burger is perfectly seasoned and the staff is super friendly. I thought they closed for a while (still not sure if that happened or not) but then one day they had a food truck and that was in the top third of the best days of my life."}
{"text":"Jurassic grill consistently has quality food and the process are pretty great. They have unlimited toppings and the Cajun fries are great. If you don't eat red meat you can sub for veggie or chicken easily.  They also have empanadas, chicago style hot dogs,  and amazing cheese fries.   JG is an order at the counter type of place. There are a few tables but it's great for  take out. (nice cause their arnt many take out burger places on campus) the furnishing is simple,  but they're open late so you can stop by after the bars for the best late night food.   The staff is really friendly and quick.  They grill the burgers in front of you,  and make everything fresh! You can really tell the difference.    Con: they only have American cheese."}
{"text":"Great service and great food! Me and some friends went to eat late at night here and had good service. We had the empanadas, which were delicious! Happy that there were vegetarian options as well. I have also been here before to eat the Herbivore burger and fries. Never have any complaints about this place. Great food at a great price!!!"}
{"text":"What you typically hear is that Jurassic Grill is a ripoff of 5 guys or meatheads. This could not be further from the truth. Every time I've been here the burgers are cooked fresh right before your eyes and the toppings are displayed in a refirgerator in plain sight. There is none of the behind the scenes burger building like you'll find at other places. Price wise Jurassic Grill is comparable to 5 guys or meatheads. The only problems are the lack of seating and the strange hours. Even considering these, Jurassic Grill deserves a five star rating, and then some. When you stop by be sure to say hi to the owner and chat with him a bit if it isn't too busy. The times I've been there he was working the register which shows his dedication. Jurassic Grill is a must-visit for any burger lover, on campus or not."}
{"text":"Stopped by here twice on the way home to get a burger here. Got the double cheese burger with fries. Pretty good value for a college town. The burgers and fries are pretty greasy and made pretty quickly. Pretty clean restaurant, but usually take it to go. Get a decent amount of fries and the burger isn't too small. Overall quick service and good food, not for somebody on a diet though."}
{"text":"Solid burger place, especially considering the other options on campus. Prices are very reasonable, though I feel like there could be more fries. Some compare it to Five Guys, but I haven't been there enough to judge. Worth checking out though if you like burgers."}
