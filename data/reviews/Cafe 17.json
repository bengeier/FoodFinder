{"text":"A lot of people at my job come here for lunch and i wanted to see for myself. This is going to be my new lunch spot for 2018! I ordered the turkey reuben with sweet potato fries and it was great! No complaints. The owner strives on customer service and just seems like a well rounded person. The kind of owner that wants to know all of his customers. I can't wait to try more menu items."}
